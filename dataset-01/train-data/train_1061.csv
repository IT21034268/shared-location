2,Noice Cancelling ? You gotta be kidding,"These headphones are just plain horrible. Looks are very deceptive, they look great out of the box but peformance is horrible. When there is no audio and the switch is on, it creates humming and is really unfcomfortable."
3,OK - Has some quirks,"These headphones do the job, are fairly comfortable, and have do doubt saved me from a lot of ""loud co-worker"" distress. However, I'm writing to warn about a tendency of the phones to creak if you turn your head a little or lean back. Very little movement is necessary to induce this fairly loud noise which apparently is created by relative motion between the plastic parts. I bought them through Dell when I ordered a laptop. This is my first pair of noise cancellers and I'm looking to upgrade."
3,Nice but not great,I used these headphones on a flight to Europe. I had no experience with noise canceling headphones so I did not know what to expect. I was disappointed!! I had plenty of time to experiment so I concluded that a certain frequency appeared to be blocked. There was definitely a difference when the power was turned on but there was still a lot of airplane noise. The phones were comfortable and far better than airline issue. I would recommend them if you want to hear the movies or music on long flights. I would like to compare them to high price stuff like Bose.
1,Useless,Pond block does not work at all. I tried using it in a outdoor fountain and it did nothing to stop algae. I purchased another liquid brand and two capfulls does the trick and i have zero algae in my fountain. This product did not work at all for me
5,This is truly a chinese secret,"I looked at this DVD at least three times before attempting to use the techniques with the regular ""trigger points"" approach in my practice.I was blown away with results.I must say I braved myself to repeat them on several other clients .The results were INSTANTLY just as successful.My clients now all believe I must be sent by GOD ,since traditional medicine is not as effective .A must for every massage therapist especially one who believes in TCM.I have now ordered the entire series of these DVDs."
5,Lots of fun for music buffs,"I bought this gift for my hubby and we love playing it. We also have ""Riff"" and didn't like it nearly as much. It's a great game for music trivia buffs and has really cool video clips and puzzles. We'd highly recommend it."
5,Too much family fun,"This game is a lot of fun for the whole family. We play teams or individuals, depending on the age range. It has questions for all types of music, country, oldies, 80's, rock, etc. This game is worth it's price, no more than worth it's price.BUY THIS GAME or any scene it game."
4,Satisfying read,This is a wonderfully written book especially considering it is her first. Sofia is looking for magic and the answers to her life while trying to make a living as a waitress and selling her art. She burns the images of saints into wood. The book immerses the reader in the Corpus Christi Tejano culture. I couldn't wait to see how the story would end. I felt satisfied with the whole story. It is like a circle that is complete.
3,Make Sure to Buy the Right Speaker,"If you are looking for a pair of single channel speakers, save yourself some money and buy the single tweeter pair instead. The dual tweeters are not taken advantage of when wired as a single channel. To take advantage of the dual tweeter you must run stereo outputs from your receiver. This product is designed to be wired as a left AND right channel speaker assembly. That's great for small rooms (bathrooms, hallways, etc.) where it is impractical to set up stereo speakers. However, for a home theater there is no added advantage. The instructions for wiring this as a single channel are not very clear. It sounds fine working in single channel mode, but buying these two speakers individually for a stereo or home theater application provides no performance advantage and ends up being a waste of cash."
4,Good in ceiling speaker,"I installed this speaker (dual voice) and two matched single voice Phoenix Gold speaker in my living room home theater. The dual voice handles the two ""surround back"" channels of a 7.1 setup. Sound quality is good, and installation was easy. The speakers are heavy and feel very solidly built. Overall, very pleased."
2,Psychophantic,"This book spoilt by being too psychophantic. It is not a patch on Hal Colebatch's ""Blair's Britain"" (Claridge Press) which is geniunely bold and penetrating and which shows what Blair's ""Modernisation"" really means and the real political agenda behind it."
2,Not very good.,"Not very good, had to send the first one back because it was shipped with a broken screen. a bit complicated to figure out and you cant really choose what you want to listen to."
3,"Decent mp3 player, but dont expect your [...]","My Trio mp3 player works pretty well. The instructions were severely deficient, so you're on your own to figure the device out. The major problem is trying to get your [...]. Don't count on it. So, if you get a good price, without a [...], then its a decent mp3 player. But if you are buying it based on the after-[...]price, look for another product."
5,Of course it's great!,"Of course all the songs on a greatest hits album would be great, but I think ALL of John Denver's songs are great, not just the ones on here. My mom gave this to me for a gift. I encourage you to buy Poems, Prayers and Promises, Farewell Andromeda, Back Home Again, Windsong, and Spirit. There's many many more beautiful songs where these came from."
3,Great music poor sound quality,"I love John Denver music, I have been a fan of his for years. This CD features some of his greatest hits ever. This disc has sound quality issues. The volume seems really low, I have to turn up my CD player as far as it will go. I guess you have to consider the age, although I have some older CD's featuring other artists, that sound infinitely better than this. All and all not good job of transfer from master tape to CD, could be a whole lot better. If you want to hear what it's supposed to sound like, go buy Buddy Holly's Greatest hits from the original master tapes, on the Universal/MCA label. This stuff was recorded in the 50's and sounds as good or better than what is out there today. Bottom line is there is no excuse for this."
2,The backpack riped already. Week 4 of school.,"The backpack looks great but, it is not the strongest. The stitching gave way at the bottom of the backpack."
4,Questions answered and raised,"This handbook's strength is not in its discussion of technique, although this stuff is very good.The HWA's handbook really hits home with the writers that grapple the questions and challenges that are facing the horror genre at the moment and then manage to raise questions of their own that need to be addressed further.A huge depth of knowledge and a great help for writers tackling their own writing so well worth it for any horror writer, amateur and published professional."
3,"Okay but not really a ""How To"" manual.",I am only part way through this book and might have to return to do a more thorough review at a later date. What I have read suggests that this is a collection of essays by practitioners in the genre rather than a guide for the Horror Writer wannabe about how best to proceed. But my final judgement is pending at this point.
1,I need a magnifying glass,"This book is written very poorly. Editors and Publishers expect our work to be 10 or 12 font size, and double spaced. This book, I am not being sarcastic, but I can barely read the writing!!! If you like books that are written so small you can't even see the words; but this book!!! I have 20/20 vision to by the way, and it's just pitiful. Thanks for Nothing."
1,Kindle edition is a waste of money,"I paid 9.99 for the Kindle edition of this book, and the thing that infuriates me more than anything about e-books is that I can't return them for a refund. This edition is the most poorly formatted piece of garbage I've ever had the displeasure of shelling out my hard earned money for. I have read self-published books by teenagers that showed more attention to quality than this. I read the print version of this book, and there was no problem. The Kindle version? Rife with spelling errors, missing passages, and completely nonsensical phrases that look like the formatter skipped over a line or 10. For example, page 46: ""Besides, by the time backwards into my unconscious thought."" That is not even a complete sentence! ""x"" is substituted for apostrophes and entire pages are left blank when there should be text. When I set down money for something, I expect quality, and this is not a quality product."
3,Needed a Magnifying Glass to Read it!,"I was very disappointed with this book. First of all, I've never seen a book typeset with type so small, It might be 8pt, most books are 12pt or thereabouts. I'm a young man with decent vision and I had trouble reading it.Secondly, like most of Writer's Digest books - it's hit or miss on quality. They've published some great books, but they've also published an equal number of duds. Quality, NOT quantity folks!Thirdly, the book is a collection of essays, not a cohesive guide to writing horror. I wanted a book where I could examine the mechanics of creating good horror; this was a series of opinions on various aspects, but was not well unified at all.There may be a few nuggets in there, so I'll give it three stars, but have a good look at any Writer's Digest book before you buy - they seem to be interested more in making money than serving to educate bourgeoning writers."
5,Just what we needed!,"This collection of essays is a valuable asset to anyone hoping to craft a story that brings chills (or shock, as the case may be) to its readers. From characters to plots to settings, the BEST writers in the horror world are assembled here to share their advice and secrets with you - don't miss your opportunity to benefit from this unique and insightful book."
5,Simply the Best Horror Writing Book Available,"The original hardcover edition by Mort Castle was fantastic, and this new paperback edition improves on that edition with updates for horror-writing in the 21st century. Horror is far removed from its heyday in the 1980's, and this new edition is a realistic assessment of the current state of the industry. If you're thinking about writing horror professionally, you need to read this book first."
5,No Updates????,This was a really great book in its day. Why on earth doesn't the author or publisher update it???
2,WE REMEMBER THE SADNESS AND WASTE,The only reason to listen to Moody Blue is to remember how ill Elvis Presley was from suffering from the debilitating effects of prolonged drug abuse when he recorded the songs that are found on this last recording of his life. Moody Blue helps us remember the sadness and sense of waste that surrounded the last stages of Elvis' life.John
1,Disappointed,"Although this is a great way to get two albums in one CD, the song LET ME BE THERE is not included on this CD. LET ME BE THERE is on the original Moody Blue album and should have been included to make the combined album complete."
5,i like it,"i bought it for my mother, it was a little late shipped but it was christmas. it came in good condition. i paid barely anything for it. she LOves it. i looked for it forever. but all in all she loves it."
4,Moody Blue,"Although somewhat of a ""patchwork"" album (live cuts mixed with studio cuts, most songs are covers), it is a must for any real Elvis fan. The quality is very good, with some beautiful songs."
3,The last album.,"This is Elvis' the last album. Released two months before he died. It is a colage of live and studio recordings.The only songs that are not covers are Way Down, Moody Blue (composition of Mark James who wrote Suspicious Minds) and It's Easy For You (Andrew Lloyd Webber an Tim Rice' composition). Unchained Melody is a boring cover of Righteous Brothers (on That's The Way It Is he covered their You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling), Little Darlin' is a cover of classic doo wop song, He'll Have To Go was a hit for Jim Reeves, If You Love Me and Let Me Be There are John Rostill's compositions and were hits for Olivia Newton-John (?),... The only two songs that are really great are George Jones' She Thinks I Still Care and Johnny Ace's Pledging My Love.If you are not The King's fan don't buy this album!"
5,Excellent Job BMG!,"This cd is excellent even though its nothing we havent heard before, its much more clearer, as they remixed it, you can hear how powerful elvis voice comes through, as he also shows he can still rock with way down! Keep it up BMG, we still want more unreleased stuff but this is great! Long live the king still selling 3 million records a year who can argue!"
4,king of rock,"this album has a little of everything for fans and collectors, drug abuse, bad eating habits and his cronies the memphis mafia..all contributed to his unhealthy life and demise."
4,elvis moody blue album,It wasn't up to Elvis' usual standards. Of course he wasn't exactly in great health at this point. It just lacked the energy of previous albums.
1,misrepresented,The picture depicted here is not the rare lp. The rare LP is not a tan label. Nor does it have a circle on the cover. This appears to be the Canadian black vinyl which could be purchased on E-bay for one tenth the amount shown here. Therefore I can not sell my USA black vinyl here because it is not the identical one shown here.
5,Elvis' songs,I purchased 3 cds of Elvis Presley songs--as I listen I can imagine that he's singing to me in my own home. Just wonderful music. It does help to have a good sound system too.
1,Thoroughly Disappointed upon comparison...,"I'm sorry but I can't recommend this translation of Faust 1 & 2. It lacks heart, charm, wit, poetry, color, music...I can only tell you to:...Compare this ""modern"" version to DAVID LUKE'S very special and magical translation....Compare the difference in print styles and layout design on the page....And think also about why Goethe decided to write in Rhyme.Then make up your mind!"
3,Great Price $5.60/DVD,"Breakfast at Tiffany's - Anniversary Edition - WidescreenSabrina - Full ScreenRoman Holiday - Collector's Edition - Full ScreenFunny Face - Anniversary Edition - WidescreenParis When it Sizzles - WidescreenEach DVD comes individually wrapped in its own case with official cover from the movie, for about $5.60 Each. I like this better than placing all the DVDs in one box like most TV Seasons are wrapped (Ex. LOST)"
5,Great set!,I purchased this set for my wife who is a new found Audrey Hepburn fan. She watches each DVD over and over! Great collection of movies!
4,this is a review,"If you like Audrey Hepburn this is a very good collection. All the movies are classics, except Paris When it Sizzles. They should have added Charade or My Fair Lady."
1,What you should know,Only one (Funny Face)of the five movies in this box set would play. The other four movies showed a sign saying wrong signal. So if you live in the southern hemisphere be prepared that your purchase may not play. The cost of postage does not make it practicable to return.
4,Beauty Captured on Film,"Watching Audrey Hepburn was like winding time back to when the world was innocent. Sitting down and taking time out of the busy side of modern life is a gem. It is so hard to believe that these movies are almost 60 years old. No modern day stunts just pure presence of life, and values."
5,Perfect for the Audrey Hepburn fan,"I ordered this to take on a long trip down in Florida, where I would likely have to stay in because of the ever so changing weather. As someone who loved three of the movies on here already, I decided I'd likely enjoy the other two... and I did! Perfect."
5,My favorite DVDs,"These collection includes some of my favorite movies plus for the price, 5 movies is a wonderful deal. I'm very happy with my purchase. My only complaint is that it doesn't have Spanish subtitles and sometimes I can't share them with my Spanish-speaking friends."
5,I'd do it all again!,"My transaction went through without a hitch! Great product, prices, and fast shipping! Tough to beat with this great, classic collection!"
5,10 kt. yellow gold round solder wire .020 inch dia.,"Gold is expensive wheather it's solder wire or the chain of a necklace. It worked just fine for me, but the price vs. length was staggering."
4,Contemporaneous collection of stories about pirates,"This is actually a reprint of The Pirates Own Book, which is a compilation of contemporaneous stories about pirates which was compiled in the early 1800s. It appears to be the basis for much of what we know about pirates today. Because it was written long ago it doesn't read all that smoothly (despite editing) but it is facinating. Anyone with a serious interest in pirates should read this book."
1,Boring and outdated.,"This book is sickeningly boring. One forgets that they are reading a book, but rather feels that they are reading a 150 year old newspaper or textbook. All this book delivers is an incredible number of facts that gave this reviewer a headache. This book was a punishment."
2,Not as good as Punk Bites One,"This album features the same variety as Punk Bites, but there are just too many bands on here that aren't good at all. Many of the good bands put some of their worst songs on this album also."
4,Hymns Plus Devotions Equal a Winner,"I purchased this devotional book based on several recommendations from other Christians. If you like hymns and if you like a devotional format, you should enjoy this book. I bought one for myself and have given two as gifts. I like the format which includes the hymn title, words to the song, the melody line, a relevant Scripture, a thoughtful challenge, and a short message to go with each hymn."
3,Amazing Grace:366Inspiring Hymns & Stories for Daily Devotions,"It's a good book, just not nearly as good as the original that my library has. There is much more story line & info in the original."
2,Not what I expected,I was looking for a replacement copy of the same book and this newer edition has lighter printing than the original edition. It is also a different format on the page and seems to be of lower quality than the original. This is why I returned the books and was able to find the original editions through Alibris.
4,Lovely book about friendship and compassion,"While my 6 year old found this book ""sad,"" we both enjoyed the true story of a flood in Vermont and how the community banded together to help each other. A good, gripping read aloud!"
4,Vermont Flood of 1927,"This nonfiction picture book tells the true story of how one farm family, along with their neighbors and the farm animals, survived the Vermont flood of 1927. The story is narrated by the young daughter in the family. An uplifting tale because it shows humans coping with disaster, helping others cope, and helping all living things survive."
5,The Widow of the South,"Whether one is a ""Civil War Buff"" or not, this is a must read and a page-turner. The central character, Carrie MacGavock, takes a long and arduous journey while never leaving home. She ""travels"" from being a well-protected and privileged plantation owner's wife, through being nearly crippled with grief over the loss of three children to death, to a power-house nurse for the wounded and dying, and finally to a no-holds-barred developer of a sanctuary for the dead and a life-long mourner for those interred upon her land.Robert Hicks has produced a work that not only deserves to be made into a movie, but he has written it in such a way that the opening and closing chapters set a perfect opening and closing scene sequence."
3,So close and yet...,"I am a Civil War Re-enactor and general history nut. I will admit my degree is not in American History but I have done my fair share of research in this area. For the most part I enjoyed the story and enjoyed learning something new. Where it blew chunks was the affair of a proper Southern lady with a wounded man of low birth in her own home under her husbands nose. While the three main characters were well fleshed out, most of the other characters were paper dolls set in the pages purely for decoration. The husband was done a huge injustice by being made so two dimensional. I can't fault the history and did feel the author got the feel of the times. I just wish there was more meat on the secondary characters bones."
3,Widow of the South,"I prefer non-fiction books, but do in fact enjoy historical fiction, although by some people's standards this probably wouldn't fall into that category because some parts of the story are embellished. Despite that, I think it is an interesting story of characters from different walks of lives, different military ranks, etc and enjoyed reading about their different perspectives. At times, I did have to look back to past chapters to remember which character's storyline, and that was frustrating. But I did like the author's writing style and that's always a big deal for me. I felt that some of the story was never developed fully, such as what happened to Carrie McGavock's children, instead the same info seemed to be repeated. I love books and appreciate that each book is very important to its authors, it takes alot of effort and care to produce a book, and so my conclusion is that it was worth reading."
4,Good Book!,"This book caught my attention since I first saw it at the book store. The cover was pretty capturing for me, so I eventually gave it a try about a year later. I must say it was better than I originally thought it would be! I liked the plot and the history of the Battle of Franklin that the story lossly follows. The only reason I do not give this book a 5 star rating is because it was a bit wordy for me at times. At times the emotions were a bit difficult for me to comprehend without reading over the text a few times. That being said, I highly recommend this book to pretty much anyone!"
2,Can't Finish It!,"This book is just to hard to follow. I can only read a few pages at a time. I keep having to go back to previous chapters to remind myself who he's talking about. There are too many characters that have a whole chapter devoted to them so that you forget about them by the time they are brought up again.There doesn't seem to be much of a plot either. I enjoy the historical aspect of it. I also relate to Carrie in the death of her children, as I have lost 2. But It's so hard to read that I finally gave up."
5,One of the Best,"I cannot give this book the praise it deserves. Its a novel that will have a place in my heart and mind forever. The characters, although fiction, are wonderfully drawn and never boring. The battle scenes feel as if you are there and how tragic the war was. Read this book, you will love it."
3,A reflection of current history trends - women and the war,"There is a big push among historians to look at the effect of Civil War on women and how women influenced various aspects of the war. Robert Hicks picks up on that theme in his novel THE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH.The novel tells how Carrie McGavock is changed by the war and how people around her are changed. Suddenly the war is at her door step and she is no longer sheltered from the horrors of war. It tells of her relationship with Zachariah Caswell, whose life she feels she saved and whose life he feels she destroyed. Carrie is no ""plushing violet"" when it comes to speaking up for the veterans that she identifies with and is representative of untold numbers of Southern women who devoted their post war years to the tending of graves.Its interesting that on the current best sellor list there are two Civil War novels, WIDOWS... and THE MARCH. Between the two I would recommend WIDOWS."
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered this book especially because it says it is in large print . the one I recieved was not in large print , So for me It is difficult to read the smaller print , so I am disappointed ."
3,The Battle of Franklin,"If this book interests you then I strongly suggest you pick up a copy of The Black Flower by Howard Bahr. This compelling novel also takes place during the Battle of Franklin, and most of the setting is a home turned into a field hospital.(perhaps based on the same house). The Black Flower had the misfortune to be released at the same time as Cold Mountain (without the big bucks behind it). I feltit was a far, far superior book. I plan on reading The Widow of the South because of my interest in the Battle of Franklin, which is a result of reading, and LOVING, The Black Flower."
2,Wish I hadn't wasted the time....,"The plot could have been interesting - but wasn't. I am an avid reader of historical fiction adn particularly enjoy the Civil War timeframe. I was completely irritated by the change each chapter to a different character's perspective, but what was worse is that each chapter still maintained the ""first person"" narrative. Another horrible inconsistency was Mariah's speech. Poor ""ebonic"" English in one place, perfectly phrased English in the next without any discernable difference in circumstance.All I can say is this, ""Was there no editor??"""
3,This is a best seller?,"I love to read- I especially love history and southern fiction, so I thought this would be a great read for me. I was wrong! The characters are never really developed well- you never feel that connection that makes you want to continue to read about these people. He really skimmed the edges on everyone. This could have been great- the idea behind it and the storyline really catch you. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."
2,Kind of hard to follow,I am currently reading this book and am finding it very hard to follow. It is told from multiple points of view which takes away from the continuity. I am hoping that it gets better as it goes on.
5,A great read for a Southerner stuck in New Jersey,"The Widow of the South stacks up in my book of must reads, along with other great historical fictions by Eugenia Price. Robert Hicks was able to bring Carrie McGavock back to life & I thoroughly enjoyed reading about her changing world. Each Chapter of Hick's masterpiece was written from a different character's perspective & this proved to enrich my mind by shedding light on the world that once was from several points of view. Those that resided at Carnton may have passed on & may be resting in the very ground with which they once walked, but Hicks has helped them live on & I thank him for introducing them to me."
5,Well written historical novel,"This novel blows Cold Mountain away! I am still reading, am near the end, and have been unable to put this one down. I am reading at every opportunity, which is something I rarely make the effort to do these days with so many obligations. I highly recommend for anyone who loves historical novels, especially those written based upon real life characters. I am not a big civil war fan, but find this one to be fascinating, and now I am anxious to find more historical fiction on the subject. Thank you, Robert Hicks, for this wonderfully written book...it has brought me much enjoyment. Five stars!!"
3,Disappointing,"This book was worthwhile reading because I learned about the battle of Franklin and life in that town during the Civil War. However, the behavior of the main characters were not believable. The Widow (who is not even a widow during the story) is the worst. Was she a grieving mother, a depressed and lovelorn housewife or a cruel and brutal woman? It appears she was all of the above. It was hard to like her and I think I would have liked the real Widow of the South."
5,A great summer read,"We chose this book for our book club this month & what a delight! I really enjoyed reading this book. It opened up my mind about the civil war & all the post-war effects on the country. The down side to this book is that there were times in the beginning when I had a hard time figuring out who were unionist/confederates & remembering who was who. Each chapter is either a place (given in 3rd person) or a character (given in 1st person). Once you get the hang of it you'll notice that the chacters are well-established & complex. By the end of the book I was in tears. It's a very touching story- which I think would be great for both male & female readers. To those on the sensative side- there is some language & gory description. Overall, a great read!"
5,Widow of the south,"If you are interested in the Civil War, this is excellent reading. We travelled to this plantation, toured it and found it very interesting. I highly recommend this book."
4,The Widow of the South,"Fascinating historical fiction book...based on the Battle of Franklin which so often is forgotten but had more casualties than D-Day! Also shared the story of a fascinating woman who cared for these fallen soldiers for years after their deaths, turning part if their land into a cemetery."
1,not a great read,one of the most boring and confusing novels I've ever read! Even for someone like myself who enjoys a civil war novel ... not very entertaining.
4,Excellent Read,"This is not my standard fare, but this book was recommended to me by someone I respect, so I gave it a whirl. The cover had me thinking I was about to read a romance novel, and the description had me even more afraid. I was wrong, though. This is a story about love, but it is much more than love between a man and a woman. There were so many levels to this story, and it fascinated me. Just when I thought things were going to become predictable, the book surprised me. PErhaps it was because the author was fictionalizing real characters, but he kept things in line and moving along. I'm glad I read this book, and would recommend it to anyone."
3,Widow of the South,Unable to review this product as it was never received. Amazon was unable to fill the order and the charge was taken off my bill.
2,Way too long and weakly written,"This book is a classic case of an author who didn't have the historical knowledge or the prose writing ability to fully realize a very interesting historical story. Other reviewers have catalogued the writer's errors so I will confine my comments to the weakness in fleshing out the characters. The author included several interesting scenes but most were buried in dense description that added nothing to the story,"
2,I Have to Abandon This One,"I tried to finish this book, I really did. I love books about the Civil War and have read many. But the characters, oh dear, the characters. Was Carrie McGavock just downright nuts? She comes across that way. Some elements are confusing, such the early-on confiscation of Carnton Plantation by the Union; I didn't expect to see John McGavock again after his encounter with Union troops, and the miserable, pointless execution of a wounded mule. I don't find the characters sympathetic, just odd. The true story of this place in Franklin is probably very interesting.Fictitious or real, I couldn't stick with it. A much better book about women and the Civil War is My Name is Mary Sutter by Robin Oliveira."
3,Entertaining Audiobook,"This book has been on my to-be-read list for a while. I liked most of the story, but it was a little hard to get into the romance. The characters were real people, which I liked, but I still had a hard time liking them very much. I enjoyed the battle scenes, and I enjoyed the romantic parts (few as there were). I shed a few tears at the ending, but I don't feel like I really connected with the whole story or the rest of the characters apart from Zachariah and Carrie. I wanted more romance and explanation of what came to pass between those two, the story played out kind of vaguely. It's been a little while since I listened to the book, and I have forgotten a few things so I know this review is probably not very helpful.I liked it, but I don't think I'll listen to this one again."
3,Interesting but....,This was an interesting piece of fiction/non-fiction.I found Carrie very interesting so much so that I looked her up online and found pictures(I listened to this one audio) and information that really made her come to life.That being said the fictional account of Carrie and Zachariah was well a little hard for me she being a southern belle and propriety and all.I think it would have been just as good of a book if the opening of the hospital and the events from there would have brought her and John close again.Instead of the rift between them continuing even though he supported her moving the soldiers.Carrie was a strong southern woman who I did enjoy learning about.
5,Facinating story; wonderfuly told,"I was lucky enough to stumble across an Advance Reading Copy of this novel as was blown away. I have read reviewed many novels set during the Civil War (check our my other reviews and my Listomania List) and this taunt and evocative novel is one of the best of its kind. The Battle of Franklin, though little has been written about it, was one of the bloodiest of the war. Imagine five Confederate generals lined up dead on the porch of a house after the battle, and the owner of this house, Carrie McGavock's story is the subject of the book. Aside from her story during and after the battle there is a wealth of minor characters that bring the period to life. In short this is so much more than an novel for Civil War enthusiasts, but like ""Cold Mountain"" (though in many ways much better) a book for everyone."
4,History Made Readable,"Prior to reading this book, I had never heard about the battle in Franklin, TN. I love historical novels about the Civil War, and this one is full of fact and makes you want to keep turning the pages to see what happens next. If the opportunity ever presents itself for me to visit Franklin, TN, I'll not pass on it."
4,The Widow of the South,"Great historical novel, makes you want to visit the plantation in the story. In fact I went to Franklin, Tennessee and toured the plantation and the city."
4,Gripping tale of war,"One of the most amazing things about this book is that it is based upon a real person, Carrie McGavock, who reluctantly opened her house to Confederate soldiers in November 1864 to operate as a makeshift hospital after the bloody battle of Franklin in Tennessee. We get to meet her family members and get glimpses of the soldiers that pass through her house, whether they lived or died. As can be expected from a war story, there is little mincing of words in the horrors of war, even down to the horses on the front lines. All of it is written well. I was a little disappointed at the end in the footnotes to learn how much of the veteran stories were true, but otherwise it's an excellent book."
4,~ Worth a peek~,This being Robert Hicks' first novel one can say he has a bright literary future . This story is set during the Civil War and delves into the life of Carrie McGavick whose home was taken over by the Conderate army to facilitate it as hospital for wounded soldiers. This event dramatically changes her life and those in her circle. Hicks offers wonderful dialogue which gives the reader a sense of the struggle fought by these characters as he builds his story. My only reason for downgrading from 5 stars to 4 was the tying up of the story in last few chapters left me wanting somewhat. I would however highly recommend this book and I look forward to Mr. Hicks future offerings.
2,boring boring boring,all around boring book!!! i always finish a boo konce i start reading it so i finished it but woah it did take some work!!!!! it goes back and forth way to much!!!! overall its just plain boring
5,I cannot write enough to give this book the justice it deserves.,"I was never one who enjoyed reading any book, non-fiction or fiction, about history. I mainly bought this book becuse the title and cover intrigued me. Once home, I stayed awake all night reading this book. It is absolutely amazing! They way Mr. Hicks intertwined history with fiction, love, romance, death, and survival made me turn page after page. This is an excellent book that anyone who is interested in history or just a wonderful story should read. Plus, I must give Mr. Hicks my deepest thanks, as now I am reading more historical books (fiction and nonfiction). I owe my new found love of these types of books to Mr. Hicks!"
2,Depressing,"I don't know how a man can give a prospective from the eye of a woman, but that is how this book is written. I know that it is an accounting of an actual battle and that part of the story was mildlly interesting but the accounting of the nutty female who falls in love with a broken soldier and constantly cleans up blood; the wise slave who isn't quite in this world, the detached husband who knows his wife is involved with the soldier but doesn't care, and the children who are dead but constantly present make for a depressing and sad book. I would like to know the author because HE is the strange one - not the story. Sorry I read it and would NOT read any of his other attempts at writing."
5,Unparalleled,"This book held the gut-wrenching truth of all the physical, financial, mental and emotional turmoil caused by this nation tearing itself apart from the inside. Carrie seemed to know from childhood that she would spend her whole life in mourning. I felt that God gave her a mission to look after the memory of our honorable Southern boys who fell at the bloodiest battle of the Civil War. I'm sure there's a special place for her in heaven; she stands as the epitome of a Great American.THE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH is a must read for all Americans, especially for those who whine that we should pull out of Iraq or Afganistan after they hear of a few casualities. Nine thousand two hundred men fell in one battle there in Tennessee on November 30th, 1864! As a Southern woman, this book shook me to the core. I felt truth in every passage and cried many tears in the reading of it."
4,A poignant story based upon fact...,"This book is beautifully written, perhaps because its author remains involved in the romantic history of Carton Plantation. It is a poignant story of the horrors of the Civil War, but also reflects the human condition from the standpoint of observers who were helpless to change the conditions except on a personal level with each of the wounded and dying. The author is able to make the reader feel as if they are observing the same scenes. It is also the story of a mother who, faced with the worst tragedy that life can deliver, redeemed herself by making a difference for so many whose last encounter would be with her. I expected this to be a rather sentimental account, but it was heartfelt and made me want to know more about the characters and Carton Plantation. This is a novel based on a true story and characters."
1,History in stereotype,"Hicks' multi-layered approach to storytelling masks a basic flaw: his underlying research merely rakes the topsoil of Southern stereotypes. Carrie McGavock has a story to tell and records exist to tell it. Whether Hicks needed lessons in the methodology and raw source materials for researching historical lives or whether he simply ignored the realities of Carrie's personal world is a story that remains to be told. E. Jones's 2003 KNOWN WORLD, set in Virginia, successfully avoided this hazard by using purely fictional characters to explore a long-ignored side of Southern slaveholding. Elsewhere (Louisiana), last year's ISLE OF CANES by E. Mills sets the bar for using real lives to probe the many layers of Southern racial strife. Fiction is fiction, but when writers use a real person to portray the past, they owe it to that person to be true to his or her real self."
5,GULFSIDETREASURES,THANK YOU - THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT AND WORKS PERFECTLY!!!IT FIT INTO MY PHONE WITH NO PROBLEMS - JUST REMOVE FROM PACKAGE AND SNAP!
3,Limoge Expert??,"I love Schiffer, but I prefer Keith and Thomas Waterbrook-Clyde books on Limoge! I think that their 4 books, and especially the most recently published, contains more insight into the world of limoge."
5,#1 - A MUST THE BEST BOOK AVAILABLE TO DATE!,"ANTIQUE LIMOGES AT HOME IS AWESOME!! Written by Dubay, forward by Gaston, photographed by Britt - a winning combination for the collector. THIS BOOK IS THE BEST ON THE MARKET - much better than Gaston's which I find outdated and poorly photograhed - and it is by far Debby Dubay's best book! HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANTIQUE LIMOGES AT HOME"
5,Beautiful Book,I've just starting collecting limoges. This book has been invaluable as a reference to identify manufacturer's marks and artists. The pictures are breathtaking. The descriptions by type of piece are very helpful in determining values.
5,#1 Antique Limoges at Home is a MUST for all collectors!,Antique Limoges at Home by Debby Dubay is wonderful and a must for all Limoges collectors. I met the author and she is a dynamo who is in expert in her field: antique Limoges porcelain. She was the speaker at our Antiqarium Society and the best speaker we have had in over forty years! I highly recommend Ms DuBay's book and that all meet this outstanding American!
5,Superior book! BEST available on the subject of ANTIQUE LIM,"Antique Limoges at Home by author Debby DuBay is indorsed by mary Frank Gaston and has been reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, etc., etc. I'm a collector and dealer in Houston Texas and I highly recommend Debby DuBay's second book in her triology on Limoges! Antique Limoges at Home is educational and the author is inspirational. This book has over 1000 colored professional photographs, complete marks sections on antique Limoges, American Limoges and reproductions. ANTIQUE LIMOGES AT HOME and Collecting Hand Painted Limoges Porcelain, Boxes to Vases by Dubay are a MUST!"
5,AWESOME BOOK - ANTIQUE LIMOGES AT HOME by DuBay,"Wonderful book on antique Limoges porcelain - Antique Limoges at Home is fabulous! I found this book thanks to the 2004 Antique Trader Price Guide who recommended DuBay's series on LIMOGES porcelain. Victoria, Tea A Magazine, Victorian Homes magazine, etc., along with many experts in the field recommend this book and I agree. Antique Limoges at Home has hundreds of beautiful colored photographs and is wonderful."
5,Antique Limoges at Home by Debby DuBay foreword by Gaston,"My second book in my series on ""collecting Limoges."" It was a challenge to write a book that was different and unique but added value to the Limoges collectors reference libary. Mary Frank Gaston has stated that ""ANTIQUE LIMOGES AT HOME is invaluable to the Limoges collector."" Antique Limoges at Home addresses the number one question I recieve on my web site the difference between real antique Limoges, American Limoges and reproductions. 1000 colored photographs, 2004 value guide, and a complete marks section on antique Limoges, American Limoges and reproductions."
4,I agree - great purchase and really good quality,The plush is nice and soft and the rattlesnake versions have rattles in the tail. It's VERY large so kids feel like they are playing with a real snake. I have four varieties from this manufacturer and my daughter loves them all. She wraps them up around her bedpost at night and then plays with them during the day.Surprising amount of fun for a stuffed animal.
4,Kindle version is lacking,"The kindle version does NOT include the interchaptorial comments, which appears to take a lot away from the book. The surface story is fun and quick, though at times a little trite, as you would expect a children's story. The end of book transcripts are cool to read, and I especially enjoyed the first one, but there are constant references to the quotes and comments between chapters that I didn't read, which means that much of the meat of the book was unavailable.On the plus side, it was only a dollar, so it's not like I feel a deep sense of loss, but it's a shame that the author's vision for the book wasn't able to come through on the Kindle."
5,Brilliant score!,What's amazing is that this is not even a musical and yet there is so much music in this album! There is nothing even remotely like this in today's films. Get it and play it!
4,13 tracks only! Product description is for a different release...,"The 24 tracks listed in the description for this item (as of 5/1/2010) refers to Camden cat no. 74321 698782 released 1999 in Germany (perhaps elsewhere), that combines Breakfast At Tiffany's, Arabesque and The Zoo Chase. Can't comment on differences in audio qaulity, remastering, etc."
3,Good! Walking over other styles,"""Moon River"" is a classical soft music. This album is very listening and relaxing, and for my suprise, also intersting. Manccini had made using cha-cha-cha, jazz, shuffle and a very, very soft rock'n roll. Very good!"
4,Capote,"If you've seen the recent academy-award-winning performance depicting Truman Caopte, you can appreciate even more the role Hepburn plays in this film.And, perhaps as much or more, the crucial function Henry Mancini had to fulfill in creating this memorable music. The exact music in the movie itself is a little different than what you'll find in this album, but that is actually a good thing.This album combines aspiration, ambition, sophistication and pretense into a really irresistable brew. Hepburn's performance made us love her.But Mancini won an Oscar, too. Let's reflect on exactly how and why that happened..."
4,4 stars for Moon River; 1 off for the re-recording,"As was common in the early 60s (the golden age of jazz -in-film music), soundtrack producers made Mancini re-record the actual cues used in the film for a 1o or 12 song vinyl length LP. This great score suffers because of that trend. While this is and remains the official ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" soundtrack as released in 1961, the versions of ""Moon River"" heard in the sweet movie (both orchestral and the one sung by Ms. Hepburn) are NOT on this CD. And it's a true crime that the heartbreaking instrumental version heard at film's conclusion was omitted, but never leave businessmen to good taste.In any event, all my carping aside, this is still a very fine LP of its day. Lounge-a-holics will love it, and Mancini fans will not be disappointed. The sound quality is very good, too."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this soundtrack. The most poignant rendition of Moon River is sung by Audrey Hepburn in the movie and it is not on the album. Also different variations of Moon River that were used in the movie are not played here. The album should be redone and more added to it.
4,Good introduction to serious philosophical ideas,"I am a philosophy professor, and I am very grateful to John Perry for his dialogues. They are an excellent way to get introduced to different philosophical views. They are also very useful teaching tools. The reader who wants more can get to the texts that the discussion is based on (Augustine, Leibniz, Russell, etc.). Perry's dialogues are witty, accessible and easy to read. No technical jargon. For those who do not have the time or the motivation to read Leibniz' Theodicy but who want to think for themselves, this text is highly recommended."
3,"Ooooh, lucky us!!","(...) It is easy to understand that Spenser represents a modern day Knight. But is it necessary that all of the objects of his gallantry (both male and female) must be so damn unworthy. Even Spenser admits he doesn't like these creatures. In this sense, the story is ridiculous. And it's a damn shame, cause Parker is such a great writer!"
3,A PI with heart and smarts,"Classic hard-boiled thriller fare with a suitably misogynistic private eye. But this PI has heart and smarts and it's a totally inoffensive, good fun read that clips along.The dialogue is sharp as a fresh knife and Parker's understanding and portrayal of fighting and violence is spot on. More like an episode of Miami Vice than anything else, this is not a mind-blowing story or a shattering exploration of the form, but it is a very good venture into the depravity and real horror of prostitution. It's also funny along the way, and you can't help liking Spenser the PI almost as much as he likes himself."
1,Disappointed,"My older Plextor CD-RW called it quits after 2 years, so I was in the market for a new one. Other than only lasting 2 years, my older Plextor was pretty good. Coasters were very rare. I wish that CD-RW lasted...The PlexWriter 40/12/40S I purchased has been nothing but trouble. Plextor support is terrible (took me 2 emails just to explain I had a SCSI drive rather than EIDE). Plextor support insists I'm using bad media, yet I've tried three different brands or their media compatibility list (which were pretty hard to find). I'm pretty sure the drive is defective, but they won't start an RMA. They insist it's either my media or my host adapter (which works fine with other drives).So, basically I have to throw away this drive. At least now I know not to buy Plextor again in the future."
1,A Bunch of C**p!,"Let's be clear: the Sterbas have an agenda that stinks of sensationalism and scandal. There's absolutely NOTHING in Beethovenia that remotely hints to his so-called ""covert homosexuality"", particularly in relation to his nephew. Gee, all I thought was that this lonely bachelor who wanted a woman's love so badly and couldn't get it, saw that his opportunity to ""be a man"" (Beethoven's words, not mine) rested in his fatherhood over his nephew. His overwrought efforts to extricate the boy from his immoral mother through dastardly means is the real shocker -- not that he had subterranean ""desires for his nephew."" HUH???Perhaps there should be a book about the Sterbas' Freudian and underlying motives in inventing this tripe about a flawed but great man."
1,Garbage!,"I think some writers just like to see their names in print and feel they are more likely to be able to achieve this if what they write is sensational and outrageous. The writer makes giant leaps in judgment and speculation, going from A to Z, using completely faulty reasoning. There is little, if any, consideration given to the mores of the time, etc. I am somewhat of a Beethoven scholar, owning at least 60 books on Beethoven myself and also having borrowed many others from university libraries. No other book on Beethoven makes the kind of assertions this book does. This is the book on Beethoven that I would most likely use as kindling in my fireplace. Don't waste your money or time on this one."
2,4lbs together,"They, in no way, hold 4 lbs water each, more like 2. That is a disappontment. i got them for 7 bucks, btw.The counter can time you, but can't tell you reps unles you do curls. Sturdy, but 2 stars for being 4 lbs together."
4,Grunge + Lounge = interesting,"Hey i have been a hardcore nirvana fan since i first heard come as you are on the radio back in the early nineties. I also am very eclectic in my musical tastes...when i first heard this cd i was kind of awestruck. i didnt know what to think. After i heard the cd a couple times i loved it...its nirvanas tunes to an upbeat jazz rythem. I have seen other reviews of people nocking this cd, i say listen to the clips, and have an open mind. Kurt and nirvana were all about change and new styles...i think he would have liked this. BTW that song Where did you sleep last night was a remake of leadbellys song from the late 1890s."
4,Terrific!,This album is great. Perfect when you like Nirvana but sometimes don't want to deal with the harsh rock sound. Debbie from The Januaries lends her voice along with many others to round out the instrumentals...
1,hahaha,what a complete load of [crud]. this is like taking all of nirvana's greatest songs and [ruining them]. whoever put together this album has some issues.
1,Smells like watered down garbage.,"What a HORRIBLE idea! This compilation is an insult to everything Nirvana stood for, and completely misses the point of the entire grunge movement. If you can't deal with the harsh rock sound, go pick up a Kenny G album because Nirvana is not for you. I'm appalled that anyone would even consider buying this."
3,skrew head 4 life,its a good cd a whole lot of differnet artist z-ro magno lil flip trae mike-d al-d grace and much more the only thing i didnt like is that its not chopped and screwed but if your a screw head like me buy this cd you wont be let down
1,the pits,"boring, bland, nothing stories of boys who like to have sex. big deal. as interesting as watching someone brush his teeth. only for the mentally limited."
4,"Great, not perfect","I've found this book very helpful. It's very concise, straight-forward, and covers a substantial amount of material.The one downside is that it might be TOO concise for some people. It moves at a quick pace, and for someone trying to gain a fluent knowledge of Italian, this book alone is not enough."
4,Good Book - but need additional materials,"This is a good book, especially for someone who has previous experience with a Romance language, such as Spanish or French. If you understand how one of those languages work, then Italian is easier to figure out.One huge drawback is that there isn't a pronunciation guide so you might learn the language but not say anything correctly. There is plenty of help on the web but be aware that Italian is not pronounced like Spanish. For example, Ce in Spanish is Se, while in Italian Che.Also, words aren't accented the same way so some augmentation is needed in this regard, too."
5,The War of American Independence,"Don Higginbotham provides an excellent service to anyone interested in the revolutionary war. His book provides a behind-the-scenes look at the causes and effects of the war. It is not a gunpowder and battle history, but rather a study of the people, events, and issues that predicated the American Revolution. It is comprehensive and well written. The bibliography is comprehensive, and the subject matter is well presented for either the scholar or the casual reader."
4,Best book for ANYONE that has ever been depressed or Anxious,I have suffered ppd for the last 1.5 years. It was so bad I had to go on medication and since then had to up my dose. This book has helped me see why this has happened to me and how a person gets depressed in the first place. IT is NON judgemental and also validating but besides that it tells you how to RECOVER! It is a wonderful book. It doesn't leave anything uncovered. I want Valerie Raskin to know THANKYOU for saving my life and my marriage from the demon of ppd. I also got your book This isn't what I Expected and it is a wonderful addition to this one for the PPD sufferer. Big hugs and big thankyou to you Valerie.You changed my life :)
4,The Berenstain Bears and the Homework Hassle,The reason I like this book is because I do not like doing homework at all. At home I will always find something else to do. But I usually do it but I dont feel like it and i usually takes me a long time. I thought that it was a cool book to read. I think that kids would like it and have fun reading it.My mom usuakky make me do my homework so then I get it done.Brother bear always finds something else to do and gets behind in school. Then his parents get made at him.
4,Homework Hassle--Berenstain Bears,"Like all Berenstain Bears books this one is great. Brother Bear didn't do his homework, this book talks about if you put your mind to it and take your time you can get your homework done and still have time to play. Homework first then play time."
4,Good points and bad points,"We own quite a few of the Berenstein Bears books. This one followed the similar theme of teaching important life lessons. This lesson centers around procrastination and the importance of getting things done. Those of you who grew up on these have likely read this one before. They updated the text to say that Brother Bear was on a CELL PHONE and yet they left the picture as this antiquated phone that I could relate to but my little ones couldn't. They didn't understand what the large antenna was on the phone. This is an old book. If you took the time to update the text, spend the extra ten minutes to photoshop the phone in the picture. Not a big deal but definitely IRKSOME! Other than that, I'd say that I wasn't particularly keen on the way that they had Brother Bear speak to his parents about his 'privacy' or the way he pouts and goes off. Children are impressionable and learn the bad behaviors as well as the good ones. Not my favorite in the series but a decent story."
5,Grandkids love it,My kids loved the Bernstein Bears when they were growing up. Grandkids love them too. Good series of books; teaches good lessons..
5,Waterfowl Identification,This is a great book for waterfowl identification.It was in excellent condition.
3,Thoughts from an artist,"I decided to purchase this book for more reference photos and specific sizes of each species of waterfowl. I was not disappointed with the information but was over all disappointed with the book size and the how the book was constructed. The book had a wire binding and almost office printer paper quality for the pages. If the book was going to have a wire binding and not be hard cover, I would have liked to see heavier paper/ card stock so that the book will last more than one season out in the field or in the studio. Still depating on pulling the book completely apart and laminating each page so it would last!Please do not be drawn away from this review because the information was worth while, but would have liked a heavier format for this publication."
1,Rip off,"This wasn't a ""book"". It was a few flimsy pages of very thin poor quality paper, tied together with a plastic ring. It did nothing to help identify water fowl in flight. Anyone can identify a duck once it is in hand. This pamplet was a big disappointment. A fair price for it would have been about $1 dollar, not $10."
2,Excellent book,Very helpful in duck identification. Very well put together. Would recommend for every duck hunter.
5,Game Warden,"I was issued a copy oif the Waterfowl ID guide by my supervisor three years ago. I have used it numerous times when a species was ""tough"" or when a hunter wanted to see comparisons. The bill chart is the greates feature. I'm transferring so I must pass on my booklet to the ""new"" warden, so I have to have my own."
3,get a laminated version,"The book and content are great. simple easy to use, easy to understand ID methods. Has just about every duck you will see in Ca. too.I bought the regular version for my son and used it in the field. He ID'd his duck right away but, the page tore out before we got home. End of storry. I'm now shopping for a laminated version.Andy"
4,Waterfowl Identification Methods,"This publication is the best in-hand device I have seen, for determining species of ducks. The difference in bills is more difinative than wing patterns, and color, particularly in females. It represents a unique approach, in being able to lay the bill of the bird on the drawings on the page for comparison.I did take the four plates out of the book and laminated them for protection from soiling in the field, then replaced them. This might be a feature for future publications. Great buy."
4,first review,"Chris has done some remakes of a few of the songs on this album but these are the originals ..recorded in the seventies and early eighties.My personnal favorite on this CD is Goodnight Loving Trail. I've been listening to country music goin on 30 years and this song is a bit different than any i've heard and that includes Strait, Jones, Haggard, and Willie.I like Chris's releases from the 90's ,they are a bit more polished but if you collect, than get this one."
3,"Too short, shrunk a lot","Shirt is decent quality, but when washed and dried, it shrunk in length considerably so now the bottom and sleeves are too short!"
2,A Disappointment -- This is mostly not Dale Carnegie,"The Dale Carnegie Leadership Mastery Course has only a little bit of Dale Carnegie's writings in it. It is mostly material that was written much more recently. The newer material is consistent with Dale Carnegie's thinking and modernized to use examples from the 1980s and 1990s, but the writing lacks the punch of Dale Carnegie's original books.There are some readings from Dale Carnegie interspersed with the newer text, but they are short and don't seem to fit in very well. Most of the Dale Carnegie excerpts are from How to Win Friends and Influence People.If you want to be inspired by Dale Carnegie, buy the audio book version of How to Win Friends and Influence People instead. It is a classic."
2,Read the original Dale Carnegie book instead,"I have read Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" and I have also listened to this entire audio program. Frankly, I think you'll get more benefit from the book. ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" is just great - it's a classic, worth at least 6 stars on Amazon's scale of 1-5 stars. I'll give this CD 2 stars mainly because it has Dale Carnegie's ideas.One more piece of advice: I have read Dale Carnegie's book at least twice and my wife has read it once. ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" is a book you may want to underline, keep, and read again and again. Initially, I purchased the paperback version. I suggest you look for a HARDCOVER version. The spine of my paperback copy has fallen apart after several reads..."
2,Not THE Dale Carnegie,"This is not Dale Carnegie but just some amateurs trying to make some money out of the good name of Dale Carnegie. I think they are called Dale Carnegie Associates. lol.I've listened to it twice through and know there is virtually nothing which will be of any use to anybody.What it does, is take one of Dale Carnegie's principles, explain it in about 5% of the detail Dale Carnegie did, try to give a contemporary example and finish by going,""You'll now be on the way to leadership mastery""Its one for the bin.There is this guy with a lisp reading part of it who is so fake getting enthusiastic over ""filler"" drivvle."
3,Difficult to Communicate,"The book isn't bad, if you only want to talk about certain subjects. However if you want to communicate with someone, or look up a definition of a specific word you could waste hours. The problem comes in trying to organise a dictionary in three languages at once... it doesn't work too well or make for quick reference. The dictionary did have good content, and a wide variety of subjects were covered. It had many helpful phrases in each section and made the effort to explain Malagasy terms that do not have a direct translation into English or French. Organization was impossible to work through. it takes three hours to figure out, ""I have cholera and must find a doctor"" but only a minute or two to say ""I enjoy hunting porcupine."""
4,A Useful Communication Tool,"For a volume of its size, Guide to Communication is an impressively comprehensive text. Its thematic structure is well thought out, and making use of its index should come easily to anyone comfortable using an index-based thesaurus. Its brief overview of Malagasy grammar, combined with its phrase-oriented approach to the language, would make it the ideal complement to a traditionally laid-out English/Malagasy (or French/Malagasy) dictionary."
2,better off with something else,"I found the organization of the book anti-intuitive and the pages seem very fragile. I found it hard to get to information i needed and had too sift through a lot of information to find very basic things.Perhaps this would be a better second book on malagasy.I recommend the 'Malagasy-English English-Malagasy Dictionary and Phrasebook', and it is much cheaper too."
4,Delivers,"This forgotten Cold War blockbuster starts off kind of slow with long sections of puzzling ciphers laid out in choppy communiques. When things pick up the story's populated with a slate of characters with anonymous monikers like the Highwayman and Warlock, and they're a little hard to keep track of, plus the hero's kind of bland. When the espionage mission itself starts up, the proceedings are like a cross between Mission: Impossible and a Harold Robins' novel as there's lots of cold war sexual kinks thrown in. All told, the book's first half is interesting, but unremarkable and dated. Then at about the two thirds mark the action kicks into overdrive with shocking betrayals and reversals and lots of breakneck action that you'll barrel through. Great stuff, served with unsparing grit. A final brutal kicker is reserved for the novel's very last line."
3,Finally!,"The sound quality of the download isn't as great as I remember the original cd being (mine was stolen from my car years ago), but I'm glad to have it again."
5,It is an excellent book when you are learning about the Rasch model,"This book is very illustrative about Rasch model. I have read some books about this topic but many of them are written for people with a previous knowledge about Rasch, so I think this book is like the first step to introduce you to Rasch analysis."
4,Suppresses but does NOT eliminate projector vibrations,"Room where projector is mounted to the ceiling is suspended above a lower room. As a result, vibrations from air handler in lower room vibrated the ceiling in upper room causing the projector to vibrate. This device lessened but did NOT eliminate the vibration on the projector."
2,Reissue of the authors other book on OEX.,"If you have a copy of ""Taking Profit from the OEX"" by Arthur Darack then just re-read it. This book, supposedly published in 1995, is just a re-hash of the previous book. Even the chapter headings have the same name, and the same content. If nothing has changed since the first one (198?) then why change the title. Stan Graham"
3,Changed opinion of this publication,"On reading further -- each chapter has been exended to include later trades (1990 - 93) and some strategic changes to the approaches are suggested. The book is interesting reading, some of the comments are good (amusing) but not always helpful in trading. The discussion of SP500 futures should deter many a would-be trader, I would think."
5,An Imortant Social Issue,"This is an excellent book. Robbins discusses an important social issue, the pressure towards workaholism which starts younger and younger, in the form of compelling intertwined stories of real teenagers."
2,Very Unimpressive,"To be honest, this book really isn't about overachieving students--it's the upper-class, elite students living in the Northeastern U.S. who look at being accepted to the wrong kind of Ivy League school as a compete failure. The common thread among these kids is *not* their brains--it's their connection to others (and, secondarily, their money). While the anecdotal nature of the plot makes for an entertaining read, the interspersed ""factual"" sections are nothing more than opinion pieces of the author with narrow application. In the end, I was disappointed in the lack of depth of the work, and would suggest the reader look elsewhere."
3,"Interesting, but question the statistics","The book started out quite well and I was interested in the various students' perspectives and lives. However, as it progressed, Robbins could have made her points more succinctly and I started to lose interest. Having attended school in Montgomery County, I have an understanding of where the students are coming from. But as with any book that uses statistics to make a point, the reader must be wary of what the numbers really mean and ask himself/herself what information may be missing.But being from that area, and being one of the overachievers, I'd say the main points of the book are dead-on. It's crazy what high schoolers can put themselves through, and how they might think certain things are more important than they really are in the grand scheme of things."
1,Nonfiction? Novel? Huh?,"I was struck by the fact that in a recent interview the author said she ""won't give away the plot"" of the book, so people will buy it. Intrigued as intstructed, I went and bought it and read parts of it. But then I thought - wait a minute, a nonfiction book shouldn't have a plot, right? Why is it written like a novel? While the subject may be noteworthy (or maybe not - that's arguable), the author's approach is entirely immoral and self-centered. I think the publisher should either acknowledge this as being fiction or stop selling it. Either way, people should not buy this book if they are looking for a neutral, informative and diverse perspective of what really happens in today's educational system."
1,publicity machine not solid content,"It seems to me the ""glowing"" reviews on this page are part of a publicity machine, not actual earnest user reviews. I simply can't believe anyone who actually read this book thought it was anything other than trash. I'm so disappointed, I wish I could get my money back. Do yourself a favor and skip this one! Hothouse Kids looks really intriguing, I'd wait for that instead."
1,Are you Kidding me?,What a cliched and narrow perspective. Neither convincing nor is it interesting. Puh-lease..
1,Mountains out of mole hills,"Wow I had to stop every few chapters and take a break from all this whining, as a student who enjoys pushing myself to my so called limits, I don't find the life of a driven kid particularly hard at all. It seems that Robbins completely disregards many personas found at high school and then forces her opinions down the throats of readers with a smug belief that she's making a ""helpful"" contribution to modern society. Have any readers stopped to think: ""maybe some students actually WANT and ENJOY working hard."""
2,Not My Style,"This book is written like a gossip column with some facts thrown in here and there to make it seem serious. I have lived with the situations in the book and I couldn't get any sense of the true seriousness of the effect on the kids since even a kid moving out to foster care was treated with the same style as someone rejected for the prom. Although the points at the end of the book are good ones, a better method could have been used to illustrate how it affects the kids."
2,Decent attempt but too sensationalized,"I think this book is a decent starting point at exploring what we all recognize at a widely occuring phenomenom among the elite teens in this country. However, the approach was way too sensationalized for my taste - I was looking for intelligent nonfiction, not judy blume. I should have known given the subtitle, ""secrets of..."" that the purpose of the book is to entertain rather than inform. I have to admit I ended up breezing through several chapters, because after a while the gossipy nature frankly got on my nerves and made me feel like I was back in high school."
5,"Brilliant book, amazing read, and both heartening and scary account of high school life","I admit, I'm a fan of the author. I bought the book this weekend and finished it in a day. I couldn't put it down. I got so caught up in the character's stories (Ms. Robbins followed high school students along their march to college) that I found myself rooting for the kids. What a wonderful book. Ms. Robbins weaves in poignant journalism sections with narratives from following students in an unbelievably effective dance between social commentary and novel-like storytelling.Brava, Ms. Robbins! You have outdone yourself. This book is amazing."
4,great perspective into the overachievers lifestyle,thia book is great the author has some great points and the book gives you the information in an entertaining way. however there is some bias and you can see the author is only showing you the negtive aspects of an overachieving world. again i think thtat the book is great to read but one must take it in without buying into every word she says. overall an informative book well worth reading
1,this thing is neither silent or rockets anyone anywhere,"This thing is loud as hell. I can hear it outside my door when it is closed. Also it has no power. It has 2 speeds that are only slightly different then the off position. Can't clean it well since it has many cracks and after using it twice without success a month ago the little metal beads on the top got some weird green corrosion. Don't buy this if you are looking for something silent, everything on the package was a total lie."
1,I just want to tell some words about this artist,"EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT MICHAEL, BUT NOT EVERYONE KNOWS THE TRUTH ABOUT HE.ALL THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT HE IS THE KING IN THE WORLD... HE JUST WANT TO BE A FRIEND FOR ALL THE PEOPLE... IT IS THE TRUTH!!!IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT IT, PLEASE WRITE ME: EDITA TAIKOS PR.119-802 KAUNAS LITHUANIA"
5,Inspiring Story,"This book provides a bit of insight into the story of Rabbi Besser. The author is successful in writing a biography of a great man without fanfare or noise. The story of Rabbi Besser's life is an inspiration to all of us. It demonstrates the power of faith, prayer and a life spent doing good deeds -- without the need for continuous recognition. Rabbi Besser sets an example just by being himself. Perhaps best summed up as doing the right thing. An excellent read."
3,"Sweet, but Not Five Stars Worth of Sweet","I came across this book unexpectedly. It's a lovely story about a very special man and rabbi. But it's more out of the ordinary than extraordinary, though it's a story sweetly told and inspirational. I admire Rabbi Besser greatly from what I read, but the book itself is not even close to being great. A quick read and a gently inspiring story do not a five star book make."
5,Old Time Relijun is crazy lo-fi rock...,"These are not traditional pop tunes, even by indie standards. The vocals are crazy-excellent (and occasionally Yoko Ono-esque (but don't let that scare you)), the music uses unconventional scales, the drums are killer primitive. The album has a raw, lo-fi sound; it reminds me of old-school Beck in that respect but with tons more energy. Musically, Old Time Relijun somewhat reminds me of The Residents, so if you're into that and don't mind a rougher sound, Witchcraft Rebellion is probably worth your cash."
3,I somehow like this...,"First of all it might be wise to point out that most people are going to find this stuff simply unlistenable, so it's advisable to download a couple of samples before buying the record...Now back to the review: OLD relijun sound a bit like Birthday Party, only that they can't play their instruments, they merely strum them, producing out-of-tune, deranged loops of sounds. Arrington Dedionyso, OTR's mastermind, sings a bit like Black Francis which means that he babbles odd ravings all the time. Still, this sounds to me a bit like comedy-rock, with a lo-fi cabaret athmosphere. It surely isn't a great record but you may find it funny and enjoyable after awhile. I do!"
5,snakehouse,"I know this came out a few years back, however I am behind the times in music. This band is the reason I love the internet. I would never have heard of them when I was living in oklahoma if I hadnt linked to it as a suggestion off another band. I love every single song on snakehouse. I listen to it so often I learned all the lyrics. SO POWERFUL!"
1,unlistenable tripe,one of the worst albums i heard all of last year - it is so bad i couldnt even listen to most of the songs all the way through before skipping to the next track
5,Pulling a 'Pig William',"Pig William was one of my favorite books as a child, and I still love it even though I'm a senior in high school.Every time I get dirty clothes out of the laundry, I say that I'm 'pulling a Pig William' because that was one of my favorite parts. The philosophy of Pig William is one that can be followed by all!"
5,Yiddish Radio Project,"If you are old enough to remember Yiddish radio or grew up with Yiddishkeit,you will love this. It is a real piece of nostalgia from a cultural time that is pretty much gone. Henry Sapoznik has put together a wonderful look at Yiddish radio spanning the period from the 1930s through the 1950s. Get it.The product came in new condition as advertised and came well within the advertised delivery dates."
5,Yiddish Radio Project,Great source of hard to get information. Documents the whole Yiddish Radio movement in the United States. Recommend for all interested in this heritage of radio.
5,Vivid record of the Yiddish-speaking immigrants to the U.S.,"This recording presents a fascinating story of how recordings of Yiddish radio broadcasts were discovered and saved. It includes material of great historic interest that is also enjoyable and heartwarming, including music, drama, current events, advice programs, and advertisements. It vividly reflects the culture and experience of Yiddish-speaking immigrants to the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century. Recording includes original soundtracks as well as English voice-over so that it can be understood by those who do not understand Yiddish. This is a gem, highly recommended."
3,Wrong Color,"I don't know anything about the quality of this item, because I received it in the mail today. However, the item is GRAY and NOT almond-colored as shown."
3,"Don't get excited, its just a CAT5 patch cable!",I needed a few of these for various internet enabled bits of kit and a few of these did the job and weren't overpriced for what it is. Works fine!
2,Product received NOT the product listed,"The cables listed are gray, snagless, higher speed cables. The ones received are yellow, snag clip, standard utility cables NO BETTER than the ones I was replacing. They DO work, but they are simply NOT what is advertised... Ace has been known to bait & switch..."
3,"Works, don't count on colors","The cable works. I ordered the yellow one, cause yellow is my favorite color and I like everything to be yellow. The cord came and was actually mustard, not yellow. Kind of dissapointing. If I knew it wasn't really yellow, I would have just gotten a grey one."
5,Great cable,The cable works great. It is inexpensive and effective. I have no complaints about it. I would recommend this product to anybody.
4,look great,I bought them to replace the ones I have in use that have broken clips. Next time I pull my computer mess err desk apart I will replace them.
3,Good cable. Not Dark gray like in picture.,This is a nice cable with dual ears to protect the tabs from breaking. They work like they should which is good. They are a little pricey for what they are. Also note that the color is not the same as in the picture. These are light gray in color not Dark Gray.
1,New?,"This cable was used not new as described, very disappointed with this supplier sending used cables. Will not order again from them!"
5,Found it good.,Good wire to connect my ROKU to router. It enhances the speed as it is fast as compared to wireless connection
5,The price is right,Don't care about color the cords are hidden. Just like the high priced store cables. Great packaging. Why go to BB when you can get these.
4,7-foot cable,The cable is very good quality and was delivered quickly. The price was very reasonable and I would recommend anyone looking for such a cable to not fear buying it from this site.
4,Nice cable and fast shipping,I like the snagless connection feature. Otherwise it's your basic Belkin Ethernet cable for home or office networks. It's good.
5,Great cables,"I bought 4 of these so i could connect everything around my tv to the internet. (Xbox 360, Playstation 3, DVR, and a computer)These cables are great, they are high quality, and have sturdy connectors. They are gigabit cables.I stream 1080p .mkv files from my laptop to my Xbox 360 via Windows Media Center, wireless N does not cut it, but these cables do the job.Even though I doubt I will need speeds over 100mbps, I like having gigabit cables, and I like these cables better than the cheap blue ones on amazon. The cheap blue cables have weak connectors in my experience, and have broken off.I would definitely recommend this cable."
1,D (sastrous) War,"This movie is so bad that it hurts...I could not believe the ammount of terrible, and I mean TERRIBLE, acting, plot and everything that was included on this film.What in god's heaven is Jason Behr doing in this movie?????Somebody better tell this guy to choose better scripts!!I guess Korea should stick to MANHWA (which is very very good indeed) and not this kind of films.I had to take tylenol after this..."
3,Don't bother with the volume.,"Horrible movie. Bad acting, choppy plot, it jumps all over the place and often times makes no sense. So why the 3 stars? I had to admit, the special effects were amazing. If your looking for a no brainer movie with great effects, this should fit the bill."
3,Solid 3 stars,"Its like 2 movies in one....a fairy tale and a monster/creature movie.Pretty good movie, with a good sound track, a great ancient battle nearthe beginning with thousands of soldiers and dragons and the city battlenear the end. But i can see why some are dissapointed cause as the moviestarts gathering interest with the big city battle in the last part, andfrom that point the action should increase with a explosive ending, themovie kinda goes into another direction which has less impact and leavesus craving for something...Good for multiple views."
2,The last three minutes of the movie were COOL!! the rest was...,"BORING AND STUPID! The movie stars with some bad magic soldier guys that are killing people in a kung fu way. Then, no action until the middle of the film which you can see a war between humans and dragons in the city. Then, no action until the last three minutes that leads to the COOL one to one final battle of the two dragons.I thought that Dragon Wars was about a war between dragons, not humans! the only good stufs were the special effects that were AWESOME! Some human fights and the war in the city which was well edited. The rest was lame. Not to mention the bad acting.P.S: Don't let the cover fool you. Rent it before you buy it!adios."
3,Play It Again,"Got the movie for the kids and watched it with them. We all liked the movie despite the stories loose ends. The CG was great throughout and the story plot was understandable when taken with a Pokemon mindset. Ancient dragon tales, energy orbs and sacred powerful artifacts are not widely experienced by adult Western audiences. Will there be a D-Wars II? The kids and I hope so!"
1,Dragon-saurs!!!,"I am pleased to inform you that this is not the worst movie I've ever seen. It may have the highest budget of any of the awful movies I've seen but it is still not the worst. I once watched a theatrical release of a movie about professional bodybuilding, written by and acted in by professional body builders. That movie hurt my brain so deeply I still have scars. Honestly I've been forced to sit through episodes of Power Rangers with better acting and more cohesive dialogue than this film. But my boys (11 and 5) loved this. They now want dragon-saurs for Christmas.So here are the good points about the movie.1. The male lead has fantastic cheekbones and broody eyes.2. The FX are decent.3. It does not have Rob Schneider in it."
5,AWESOME,"Come on people, this movie is awesome! Great special effects, cool story, and best of all it's a COMEDY, and a damn good one too. That's right, it's no meant to be taken seriously, just sit back and have a good laugh!"
3,Fun Movie,"Not a movie that depends on subtext, this is a straight-forward sci-fi, special effects flick. I didn't find it to be as awful as some of the previous reviewers, and the computer graphics are amazing."
3,Blu Ray Loading Issues?!,"Hey, movie review aside, has anyone had a problem with their Blu Ray version taking forever and a day to load? My Lord! Movie was okay, creatures were cool. The bad guy was a joke. The damsel in distress was hot, and the hero was wooden. I see the token black guy was from the Office. He's cool. Just, I thought there was something wrong with my disc, so I returned it for another one and the same thing. LOADING. Great CGI graphics for a Korean."
3,Campy!,"We may be middle-aged, but we like a good knights and dragons movie as much as anyone...this one wasn't it! At best, it was light entertainment and if you left the room for 5 minutes you didn't miss much. I will say, it had some really great chase scenes...the special effects were pretty well done. The story line had some major holes, and was rather banal. Wouldn't waste my money buying it, but it's fun for a movie night rental."
1,Zero stars if possible,"Don't waste the 90 minutes of your life. I gave up at the 30 minute mark, when they still weren't out of the first flashback. I assume somewhere in the movie there were going to be dragons in modern times, but I wasn't going to stick around for them.P.S. Any movie which refers to Dragons as ""Imoogies"" should be shunned out of principle."
1,Keep Falling asleep,I keep trying to watch this movie but each time I fall asleep. There is very little I can tell you about the movie so no spoiler alerts here. I can tell you it is the best medicine if you are having sleepimg problems. The cover art makes the movie look really good. I fall asleep so quickly I never get to see the Dragon is there a dragon or dragons in this movie?
3,blu ray review,I thought this movie was better but it really stinks and although the special effects are ok on blu-ray I wish I could un-buy it because the movie really stinks
4,I don't get all the hate...,"I'm reading reviews for this movie, and I honestly don't understand why people don't like it. I think it's a good movie; is it the best movie out there? no, but it's not 'so terrible you have to see it', nor is it a comedy (although there are some funny parts). I think people are hating on this movie because they either had higher expectations going into the movie than it was capable of living up to, or they just aren't fantasy movie fans...In short, I would say this movie is worth the money to get it, and I look forward to it gracing my movie shelf soon."
3,D-War (the D is for Dilapidated),"The Good Things*Good special effects. Lots of great battles with lots of mass destruction.*Some vivid imagery, especially at the end.*Good usage of mythology.*Lots of cool creatures and weapon designs.The Bad Things*Everything else! The plot is kind of odd, the characters are incredibly bad, and the writing is bad.The Questionable Things*Some laughable scenes; can be good or bad.This can be seen either as a really bad blockbuster or a really good B-movie. In any case, the story qualities are terrible, and the only good redeeming quality in this movie are the smashing special effects and battles.The DVD has good image and sound quality, and has a couple of good making-of featurettes."
1,Lame and not funny,"This movie is just plain bad. It is not supposed to be funny -- it is a very serious attempt to bring to life a Korean legend. I actually give this movie 1.5 stars because it's not a bad time killer while getting ready for bed -- maybe watch 15 minutes here and there.But if you think this is going to be some kind of satirical film because of the reviewer that gave it 5 stars, then you will be sorely disappointed. There are a few interesting scenes, especially at the end, but that's about it. The plot is a let down, and the movie is just too disjointed."
3,Falls flat... but cool FX.,"I had high hopes for this movie! But sadly, it was not terrible enough to be amazing. Rather, the acting was not quite horrible enough to push the comedy, though the absurd plot and ridiculous creatures were trying their hardest. It was still an entertaining watch, but nothing I would re-watch, even with all the really great CG monsters.Yes, I'm saying it needs to fail more to be a success. Yes, I realize how stupid that sounds. Yes, the statement stands."
1,Worst movie I have seen in at least Ten years,This movie is so bad i dont know where to start special effects are terrible acting is subpar I dont think you can call it writing and directing is shameful jumping from one scene to another you feel like you skiped past seven chapters of the story in short i dont know what person felt this would make a good movie this is by far the worst bluray movie on the market that i have seen dont waste your time or money
1,AWFUL MOVIE -- BUT COOL POSTER,"I dare you to make sense of this movie. No, I double-dog dare you. They should release an American version with only the dragon stuff and sell it for a dollar."
2,"Bad storyline, Bad acting but good CGI graphics","The movie was entertaining enough to watch if you are into sci-Fi. The computer graphics is good, story line and acting both terrible. Good first big budget film from S.Korea but still a bit to go. Better than many other dragon flicks I've seen. The only problem is that the ""real"" dragon doesn't appear till the very end of the movie (last 5 minutes). And what's up with the Korean national folk music at the end of the movie?"
1,What?!?!?!,"This was the most confusing movie I have ever seen. The acting sucked. The storyline sucked. And the battle scenes sucked. I'm pretty sure that I could have made a better movie. How do these idiot directors get the money to write these blow-hard movies? I still don't know where the heck they were at the final dragon battle, or why the heck there weren't any dragons, or why the heck those rocket launcher wielding stegosaurus things had ninjas riding on thier backs. I think this could be worse than Piranha 3D."
1,What a waste of time,The lamest movie i have ever seen. i have seen my share of bad movies but i have to say that this one has to be one of the worst.
2,Bad Movie!!!!!,Aside from thre CGI created creatures it lakes on everything else of what a movie must have.
1,This movie is really bad,"Poor acting!Awful plot!Bad story all together!Decent effects! on a scale of 1-10 the effects were a 7.I go into every movie open minded and even watched this one all the way to the end. It was painful to sit through. I don't like to write bad reviews but, this movie dose not even qualify as a bad low budget B-rated film. Total waste of time."
2,Ridiculous,"Ok, I LOVE dragons. My all time favorite dragon movie is, of course, Dragonslayer. SO, naturally I saw this and thought ""Oh neat-o a new dragon movie!"" What a monumentally ridiculous waste of time. The only thing that redeemed the hour and half that i wasted watching this was the appearance of the classic Asian dragon in the last few frames.The story was interesting and had SO much potential....but fell totally flat. What a disappointment."
3,It's not bad with a good Pinot Noir!,"O.K. if you watch this while enjoying a medium-bodied Pinot Noir, it's not that bad. This is definitely a rental. The special effects are pretty good. Think Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets's Basilisk! Don't expect a big budget feature. Sit back and relax with a nice Pinot Noir and you are set."
2,Maybe next time,"In short, CGI sequences are great, acting bad, plot worse, dialogs are lauhgable, scenes are disjointed. If you still want to buy it be my guest but don't say I didn't warn you.Oh, one more thing, don't be fooled, this is not a comedy."
2,"Seemed like it could have been good, but...","once again, I find myself exceptionally disappointed with a dragon movie (past disappointments being ""Dragonheart"" and ""Reign of Fire""). From the previews, it looked, at first glance, that D-Wars got it right. You had a battle royal betweem dragons and their allies against tanks and attack choppers within the steets of a crowded city (and this sequence is why this movie get the second star from me).Unfortunately, that is a small portion of this movie. The rest is about flashbacks and ""destiny"" and prophesy and ""mystical only way to win"" scenerios. No, the military can't defeat the dragons, only the ""good snake"", whatever it was called, can by eating the heroine's essence.The final battle was also far too dark and hard to view. Overall, major disappointment."
1,Disappointed!,"I bought this movie thinking it would be worthwhile. Instead, I was very disappointed in this movie. The only positive thing going for this movie is a couple of good action scenes. The plot is lacking and hard to follow in spots as it tends to jump around. Almost any movie would be a better buy than this one."
4,It's good movie!!!,"This movie is good and interesting. I'm very impressive about this movie.The story line is good and the movie character was not bad. I enjoyed this movie. Some movie skills are not enough, that's the point. But this movie is still good, isn't it?"
1,Just Plain Terrible,"This review doesn't have to be helpful, it just needs to serve as a warning. There are no dragons in this movie until maybe the last 5 minutes. Avoid it for your own sake, please. (Plus it is horribly structured and misses on all cylinders when it comes to excitement and entertainment)"
1,How can they call this a movie?,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen. The previews I saw on TV made this movie look like fun. I ended up skipping the chapters in the movie to skip the horrible acting and horrible story line to try and find the ""Dragon War"". When I did find it I was so disappointed, stopped the movie and for the first time ever threw it away."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!!!,"Jason Behr needs a new agent.Seriously.Poor acting and directing, atrocious editing, and a script that is over-written to the point of incoherency reduce this promising film to absolute garbage. Should be viewed only by fans of Anime who are curious about seeing their favorite genre played out in live-action... and even then this is strictly a renter."
1,The Theater should give something Free if you saw in the Theaters,"I rented this on Tuesday when it came out. I like to give movies a chance and try to watch the whole thing, but this movie was just boring. The acting and script was so bad that I had to turn it off, after 30-minutes. The last hour that this movie would of taken if I finished, I used to wash dishes and play with my kids. Wow I feel sorry who would even thinking about buying this movie at full price. If I found it at Walmart for under $5, I would think long and hard before even buying it."
1,Why? Why Was it Even Released In Theater?,"As much as I wanted to see this movie with an objective mind without the influence of me liking one of the actors in this film. It still became truly difficult to enjoy this movie, it started out horrible and it end horribly. Sure the CGI was good better then most movies who have tried and failed to use CGI, but couldn't have they focused on the script also. The actors I think tried to make do with what they had, but even their acting came out duller then a bad joke done by Michael Richards. As much as I hate saying it and writing it these actors may need to go back to acting school. I know its all about money in this world but really what were these producers thinking as they said, ""We are going to release this in the U.S. and its going to be huge?"" Yeah a huge waste of time, at least I didn't spend money actually watching this. A huge relief on that part."
2,"2 stars for good special effects. Besides that, there's nothing worth watching in this movie.","I give this movie 2 stars for good special effects. The dragon looks very real and scary. Besides that, there's nothing worth watching in this movie. The plot is about a dragon chasing down the two main characters. The acting is so bad that I felt asleep at least two times.The Host is much better. It's also made in Korea but it's more touching and suspenseful.If you like special effects, you should watch Transformers released on DVD in 2007. You'll find out what good special effects mean."
2,Good CGI but no dice,"Dragon Wars was a recent movie I saw via my Netflix membership along with another fantasy/sci-fi movie I requested and of the two, it was the better one. However, I quickly found myself fast-forwarding through the movie to avoid having to just shut down the movie completely. I am a fan of good story-telling and acting, but I'm drawn to action and to special effects. This movie had plenty of action and special effects, but it was hard to put the story together and to take it seriously with shoddy acting and directing. The plot is intriguing, but could have done without the steretypical Chinese connections to dragons and instead been about a new idea in monster movie-making. I would recommend this movie for it's great battle sequences, but you will find yourself uninterested in the back story and somewhat confused when it's all said and done....and happy too that it was over."
1,WOW,"Not wow in a good way... I mean, yes, there are good special effects... But seriously, I have NEVER in ALL MY LIFE seen a movie with a worse script! Oh my god, its the Imoogi! Run to another place, somehow outrun a giant snake-dragon and just sit around with some doctor who makes things float with his mind (good for him) and, just when he is done, the Imoogi shows up IN THE HOUSE and kills him... and yet... somehow... THEY ARE ABLE TO SURVIVE. The romance in this movie is just as obvious and terrible. ""I bought you some new clothes"" *make-out-sesion*... Oh my god... save your money and get a good movie."
1,Worst movie ever!,Alright so everything's corny. The story seemed rushed and very predictable. Typical conflicts and quotes you see from so many movies. You have computer animations mixed with power ranger effects. This movie is not worth the time. Somehow the main female character is so easy she'd kiss any guy within a day and the department of defense keeps shotguns in their drawers.
5,Awesome Movie.,What is with all you people. I liked this movie so much. The special effects are just like the ones from Transformers. The dragon battles in the movie are super intense. The dragon duel at the end is so mezmerizing. I give the koreans 10/10 for bringing this movie to the states.
1,An expected disappointment,"I actually bought this movie knowing it had gotten no word of mouth endorsements this previous year, but the promo's of special effects and my love of sci fi flicks made it so I couldn't resist. I was hoping for something maybe close along the lines of ""Reign of Fire"" at best, instead I get something more along the lines of the mighty morphing power rangers... It also had a feel of Mortal Kombat, not the first one, the second one, Annihilation, but even that is giving this movie too much credit. Perhaps it is the seemingly disregard for a plotline. Perhaps the movie is just intended for 12 year olds. It is indeed similar to Transformers, (though that movie as well was better) in that it is slow, slow, a little action, slow , slow some more, and two big fight scenes at the end which are pretty cool. So pretty much do like I did and watch it at double speed till the last thirty minutes...The CG at the end is good, but the rest is just unwatchable."
3,Cheesy 80s music with a few classics...,"I don't own any other albums by Starship (or Jefferson Airplane or Jefferson Starship or any other iteration of this schizophrenic group) and don't consider myself a fan. I bought this album strictly because it was dirt-cheap, and I was familiar with a few of the songs.Ultimately, the album does deliver their few biggest hits from the 80s, including ""We Built This City,"" ""Sara,"" and ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now."" And those songs are lots of fun, even if primarily for their nostalgic sound.There are also a few other interesting songs that were new to me, such as ""Find Your Way Back."" However, most of the other tracks were largely forgettable.Ultimately, this album is nothing beyond mediocre. Based on other reviews, it appears that true fans will want to look elsewhere. And casual listeners like myself won't find much of value here beyond their few big hits. This disc is tolerable but nothing special."
4,The Best of Starship,"This is the best of Starship from 1979 - 91, which I still view as Jefferson Starship. A great package of the radio hits and nothing more, which sometimes is just enough. I do prefer this period of (Jefferson) Starship, which put the rock into the band and the music that was needed. If you are looking for a comprehensive Starship hits package, this is the best in my opinion."
1,very unhappy,"I got this CD because I wanted a nice representation of their music from this time period. The songs are mostly obscure, not the greatest hits, the quality is poor, they all sound tin like. A big disappointment for old time and long time fans of Grace, Paul and the gang."
3,Cat's Cradle Book and String,I was disappointed that the copy we got of this product looked to be used and arrived with no string as promised. Considering the product's intent it should have come with 'strings attached.'
2,Meh...,"Not that impressed. It says a new battery, but it doesnt perform like one.I realize that for the money, you're taking a gamble. Didnt win on this one.My first battery that I had with this phone would last for days. This one needs to be charged every night with only minimal use.If you absolutely have to have a replacement battery, spend more."
1,Outdated,"I am unsure who the makers of this DVD is but they need to make it clear that this is an 80's video. The dvd does not seem very professional grade and looks as if this was done somewhere overseas. The cover is updated but the video looks as if someone found this in the archives.The people are all dressed in what ""was hot"" back in 86 and is not up to date with current excercise. I was so disappointed that I started it out 20 minutes and simply did not like it. Excercise has come a long way and you want something current since we have learned a lot about what works, techniques not to do so you dont hurt yourself and something to hold your interest.I have another one I purchased from this same dvd family and they all look as if they are made the same way. Do not let the cover fool you into thinking this is something current.I will not buy anything from this series again."
4,Purchased for my daughter who lost her son.,Purchased as a gift for my daughter who suffered the loss of ther 22 year old son. I expect it to be helpful to her.
5,My dogs like it.and want to lick it out of the tube,"I've been using this product for years to brush my dogs teeth nightly. I buy it online because it is hard to find in local stores. They are very often sold out. I use an ""extra soft"" people toothbrush."
5,Buddy Loves it!,I've tried several different kinds of toothpaste for my dog that I adopted and he hasn't liked any of them. But this one he likes!! He Loves it and will lick it off my finger.. Now the training begins to get him accustomed to the toothbrush which will be much easier that he likes the toothpaste!!
5,Cured my dog's horrible breath,"I chose this product because of the rave reviews here on Amazon. My dog is a 7 year old Pomeranian with the worst breath I've ever smelled. I've tried all the toothpastes at the pet store except enzymatic ones. This is the first enzymatic toothpaste I've tried, but after 2 days of using it, his breath cleared up completely. Its a pleasure to be near him when he yawns now. I don't see any reversal in tartar buildup, but nothing can get rid of that aside from a real dental cleaning (I would know since I'm a dentist). However, the toothpaste does a good job in minimizing future buildup.The hugest difference to me is the complete change in his breath. I give it 5 stars for that since nothing has solved that problem for us in 7 years."
5,Still the best dog toothpaste around,I use this toothpaste for almost 13 years. My dogs love the taste. I have not noticed any side effects other than nice clean teeth and healthy gums.
5,Petrodex Works and My Dogs Love It,"I have used this product for a number of years. I have one toy poodle that even looks forward to having her teeth cleaned.The toothpaste appears to be very effective, although it probably depends on how it is applied and how often. I clean my dog's teeth 3 or 4 times a week.In small dogs, dental problems are quite common. The longer one can go between cleanings at the vet's, the better. Less risk to the animal plus the bonus of $$$ savings.The 6.2 ounce size sells on Amazon for about the price of of the 2.5 ounce at at the local ""discount"" pet stores.Good product and good price and service at Amazon."
5,Dogs love this toothpaste & it really does work!,"The 6.2 oz tube is extremely hard to find in pet stores. Have used this product for the last 5 years, but was never able to find it in 6.2 oz. Glad to see Amazon offers this size. We have 4 dogs with varied personalities. The only common thing is they love to get their teeth brushed every evening. They line up and can't wait. If you use this product daily there isn't a need to get your dog's teeth cleaned professionally and have to agonize over the associated risks not to mention costs."
3,It's ok,"I really can't say how well this product works because my dog, being the finicky pup she is, doesn't like it, but I'll be sure to edit this if she ever comes around.."
4,Good...,Dogs don't mind the paste. Must be okay then. Dogs don't mind the paste. Must be okay then. Dogs don't mind the paste. Must be okay then.
3,petrodex tooothpaste,This is the best toothpaste for my dogs. I have used it for 25 years.I do wish that the pump container was still available as it is much easier to store.
5,Petrodex dog tooth paste,"After purchasing this product locally for many years I recently found the price to have sky rocketed. I turned to Amazon and did a quick search, to my surprise I found the large tubes to be priced cheaper than those smaller one's I purchased locally. I jumped on it. The delivery was a day ahead of the projected schedule. The product arrived securely packaged and I've noticed the ""use by date"" was way out there, (8-31-2012).A great company to do business with, what more could you ask for?Lee"
3,"Petrodex Enzymatic Toothpaste dog Pouty Flavor, 6.2 oz.,","Decent toothpaste for a dog albeit it is not a substitute for taking the dog to the vet for a dental cleaning. Dog's generally hate having their teeth cleaned by anyone so value your fingers, and be prepared to replace the toothbrushes frequently when using this product as your dog may have other ideas no matter the flavoring of this toothpaste!"
4,Doggie Smiles!,My dogs love this product. Its mild and not to strong that they turn away from it. The amount you get is a lot more then I expected but glad to have so much of the product to make sure my dog's will have better teeth :)
5,Awesome product!,"Wonderful product works like a charm. Dog loves the flavor. Had no problems applying product to dog's teeth, notice improvements with a couple of applications."
5,"Good product, some minor variation in packaging","This is the cheapest price per ounce you're going to find on enzymatic dog toothpaste. I have purchased this twice. The first order came in a metal tube, similar to what oil paints for art come in. The second came in a plastic tube like most human toothpaste. I have to say I prefer the plastic tube, but it doesn't seem like you get a choice. Sometimes it will be metal, other times plastic. The product inside is the same for both, and works well. My dog enjoys the taste as well. Would definitely recommend."
3,A very good country CD!,"If you listen to just 1 song, it should Come Next Monday. It is great! K.T. has a nice voice and you'll enjoy her CD a lot."
1,Falls Into Classic Regency Cliches...,"The heroine of this book is supposed to be an intelligent woman, but she makes the stupidest decisions at all times. I totally lose patience with the device of using stupid decisions to keep the plot moving. I skimmed through the second half of this book just to get to the end."
5,Skechers Clogs,"Just as good quality as Croc w/o the price. Actually, cuter because this clog has a a flash of fire embossed on the top. My kids love them and they are so convenient for just rushing out."
2,Extremely Average Punk,"These guys are an extremely average pop-punk band. There is really nothing special going on here, and you've heard everything on this album on many other albums. They don't really do that bad of a job at what they do, but there is no originality, also the lead singer has an annoying voice. Steer clear of this one, unless you've heard it and know that you like it."
3,ok,"I got this for a gift for a friend, I just found out that when he took the tag out, a piece is stuck through the stitching and the air comes out. Its still good for a game, but it has to be refilled with air before every game. He barely gave it back to me now so I'm guessing its too late to return it now. Otherwise a good ball."
5,Magnificent!!!!,"This is the best movie I have ever watched by far.This movie might seem very weird to those whoare not familiar with the orthodox spirituality. Theymight for example not understand that Anatoli is indeed illuminatedand has clairvoyance attributes which is given to him by God as a resultof this honest repentance. He sees the future and tells themwhat to do; God is conveying his will to those who seek Him through Anatoli.God does perform miracles. Christians fail to understand that the firstChristians, the saints, the martyrs witnessed miracles in one or another wayand that is why they are faith was so strong and enable them to withstandtorture and terrible death; this kind of faith has nothing to do with thesoft faith of the majority of those who call themselves Christians today.I highly recommend this movie to anybody interest in repentance.Great spiritual food for the soul."
5,Not of this world,"This is an exceptionally well made movie with an ethos that few in this world can comprehend. For an American convert to the Orthodox Church, that includes me. I loved it for its stark beauty, its unique spirituality, and the unmistakable Gospel vignettes. Highly recommended."
5,Once is not enough! Powerful and Surprising,"This movie has some unexpected and delightful moments. There are dramatic moments and moments not explainable within a secular paradigm. Yet, when I view it I am happy to participate in all of it. It tells the story of a man who goes from despair of entanglement in himself to freedom and peace. It helps to have a bit of understanding of the Orthodox Church and the path walked by the Orthodox, but the power of the transformation depicted is overarching. The visual, even iconic, elements, must be lived with a bit to ""get it"". This is not a sweet film, but it is good. It's a bit of work, but it joyfully surprises. Definitely worth the purchase and the time to watch again and again."
5,Loved it!!,"No exploding planes, no car crashes... just the kind of movie most people will never see. This movie is for the deeply Christian at heart. To all others, it will likely seem strange and bizarre. Very revealing movie about the life of a Russian mystic, and Divine Providence."
5,A Remarkable Film,"Ostrov is a compelling film, one which captures the essence of Orthodox Christianity. For those not familiar with Orthdoxy, it is the traditional form of Christianity which predates Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Most of the Christian world, including Western Europe, was Orthodox until the Roman Catholics split off from the Orthodox in 1054. It is the traditional religion of the Russians, Greeks, and many countries in Eastern Europe. In the story of a clairvoyant, miracle-working Russian monk living in a remote island monastery during the Communist era, Ostrov captures the authentic deep spirituality which characterizes Orthodoxy, especially as lived in the monastic life. A very powerful film, it is an antidote to the secularism, cynicism, and hopelessness which afflict so many in these modern days. Highly recommended."
1,Major disappointment,"The product did NOT FIT as displayed. (I am a sz 6; purchased Lg.)Does not go to the waist, therefore no tummy flattening help. Cut at leg is much higher. Product shrinks. I would not award any stars as rating.DO NOT USE MY REAL NAME!!!"
1,The new edition not available as Kindle eBook,"I do not understand why only an old edition of such a wonderful book is available as a Kindle eBook. This has been what, in fact, has kept me from purchasing a Kindle!"
4,what I thought it would be!,"It came and was exactly as described. Nothing fancy about it, the logo looks great. I bought this as a gift and I think they are going to love it!"
5,Buy this trap -- no need to research other traps!,"I have captured four tree rats in my garage in the past three weeks, which is very exciting. This trap has paid for itself, in my opinion. Each time I place a peanut on the flat metal triggering mechanism (and a saltine as a lure just inside the door of the trap), and this brings great success.Place the trap along the edge of a wall on the ground...they like to follow the path of a wall. Additionally, before using the trap, I constructed a small ""carrying handle"" over the top of the trap using 2 long wire twist ties. This keeps me from having to actually touch the trap once I capture the rodent. I also use a wire coathanger to open the trap door when I let the thing out (far away from home, in a field somehwere)...they run out so fast it kind of creeps me out. The wire allows me some distance!"
5,Mice check in like it's a hotel!,"I live in a semi-rural area and have a problem with field mice getting into the house and setting up house behind my refrigerator, which is NOT easy to move. (They are very cute, but very destructive). I bought one of these traps and caught 10 mice in one afternoon. Apparently that was the whole family, as so far, haven't seen any more signs of them. The mice were fine and were released in a field down the road. Really worked great!! To be honest, was actually surprised at how easily/quickly they all entered the trap. I think they were hungry!"
2,Was hoping for better!,Thickness/gauge of cage is too light. Rodent flipped trap and top spring bar falls off cage all the time since metal piece that holds it in flexes. Needs to be sturdier!
5,Great Cable,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. It's long enough to be useful but not long enough to be obnoxious. Construction seems to be good, no problems so far."
1,not worth the money,"I never review these videos but I did not like this video. I am so annoyed that I bought it!! I am fairly advanced in my fitness level and this was such a lame boring and not effective video. It is only abs also, which I wouldn't liked a little more of a total body workout. Buy something else!!!"
2,Not what I was expecting,"I bought this product mostly because it had such positive reviews and I am disappointed. There is no warm up, Leah just immediately jumps into exercises that require a back round in dance training to hold your balance/ body right and a good knowledge of yoga. I have been dancing for 4 years and found her jumping into working out right away dangerous. Her moves are also advanced so if you are advanced you will probably like this alot. A knowledge of yoga is a must for some of these moves."
3,Good... but be careful,So this DVD is a great core workout. My biggest problem with it is the fact that Leah does not warm your body up at all. And with these kind of moves you must warm up. If you've never had ballet or dance lessons you could possibly hurt yourself. That being said the exercises are quite awesome and very effective. Bummer that she just goes right into the exercises without even warming up is a huge flaw.
2,Its okay...,"I've done better core workouts in my life, but overall it wasn't too bad. My lower back and neck were hurting the next day so I'm not sure if it's the combination of moves or the lack of form cuing that was the culprit. As an avid barre and Pilates enthusiast, I always aim for perfect form and this video did little to discuss proper pelvic alignment or how to decrease tension in your neck by keeping your shoulders wide and down, etc. So if you are new to Pilates or barre, be careful with this series. I would say I'm in decent shape and the workout was semi challenging, but I didn't feel much soreness in the abs the next day, which I usually look forward too after a new workout. I would say Leah's Lower Body DVD and the Whole Body workout are the best out of the bunch."
5,Core workout,It uses all of my body movements and can see definite improvments in obliques form starting the work out 3 weeks ago.
5,Effective Workout,"This is not an easy workout but it's the only workout I have done in the past year that is whittling my waistline down. The core is the focus of this workout & it delivers. The moves take time to learn because there is balance involved; these are moves the average person & average workout doesn't do. It is well worth the time it takes to learn the moves; this is a winner in my opinion. I haven't even gotten to the mat work, yet."
2,I'm not really happy with this...sorry,"I've tried this 3 times, and the last 2 times I found really dreadful. I had a hard time with the standing abs because the camera angles were weird so I had a hard time execute the moves with proper form. And I felt like a lot of my hip flexors were working instead of the abs. I like some of the floor work, but I also had an insanely hard time because I am super inflexible and I can't straighten my legs. I'm sorry, I tried to like it.I really like the upper and the lower body DVDs though. They are really intense but more doable for me. I can feel the burn too.Anyone have tips on how to increase my flexibility quickly? And what other ab DVDs do you recommend? Please comment."
5,Cute bookends!,"-They're adorable and well made-They hold up my books very well, no matter the size-Since they're slender, you can even place them in the middle of a row of books, rather than at the ends, to prevent slumping-It was a wonderful buy :)"
4,A simple guide to organometallic chemistry,This book is a wonderfully simple guide to organometallic chemistry. It is very easy to read making it a quick reference for inquiries. I would highly recommend this book to any beginning organometallic student.
3,"decent, not the best","This book is decently written. the first several chapters provide a background introduction into molecular orbital theory with subsequent chapters introducing various ligands and their behaviors in complexes, then reactions and catalytic cycles. unlike other chemistry books i own this one sources the original journal articles of some principal reactions used as examples- which can be helpful for those interested in looking up the original data. one complaint i have is that the book does not provide many examples of types of reactions, nor does it explain the exceptions to rules and why."
2,Horrible class book,This book could be way better for the topic. I don't even know why my prof chose it. It lacks a lot of very important information. Good for undergrad course not so much for a graduate level course
4,Trind Nail Repair,"If I had known Trind Nail Repair was made in the Netherlands, I would have had a better first impression even before receiving it,at least regarding it's inherently good qualities. It's a better bet than some other foreign manufacturing sites, which ,who knows, may even have put lead in it!!!! It's s good product, easy to use and effective so far. I have only had it for about a week. But it goes on easily and isn't smelly. The company from which it was sent( ""Beauty of Site"") sent a bunch of fun free samples that made receiving the packages more fun and adventuresome!oui-la-la! I recommend using their site just for the fun of it as well as the prompt delivery and good packaging etc. I have tried 3 other companies who sell similar promises of better nails, and have not had any luck with the results. This one has a more frequent application and a smoother consistency so far. Keeping my fingers and toes (nails that is) crossed!!Arlene from Oregon"
5,The ONLY thing that has worked!,"I have tried hundreds of other products to no avail. My nails have always been paper thin. However, this product is unbelievable. I believe it uses formaldehyde, which is a bit disconcerting, to harden the nails- but it works! My nails never crack, split, or peel and have actually grown beyond the tips of my fingers this month!!I have nothing but good things to say about this product and can't recommend it enough."
4,An often overlooked masterpiece from the glory days of fearless records...,"Desert rat melodic pop-punk ala descendents meets face to face. Good stuff. As we all know now, fearless records is in the toilet. Get this from the good ol' days. They don't make em like this anymore."
3,This is it?,"Just finished going through this one a third time to be sure I got it right. Sorry to say that this wasn't quite worth all the wait. Gave it three stars, but if this fell outta nowhere, I'd give it more just 'cause I expected more outta these guys.The production wasn't as punchy as it was on ""Onward"". (Where's the bass?) And while you shouldn't compare records with their predecessors, they repeat three songs from the last one, so it's hard not to.Still cool, XTC-esque vocals and guitar slash (although the guitars are lost in the mix), so by most standards, this is a fun little disc. But after almost three years, I had higher expectations.Sorry guys..."
3,Not Quite a New Album,"I have been waiting for this album for a long, but I have to say I was a little dissapointed with it. There are 8 new songs, 6 of which I really like. Song 10 and 12 just don't develope and do much . There are also four songs from their previous two albums, I only liked 2 of those songs from the past, so add 2 more to the pile I don't like much. So doing the math I guess I liked 8 of the 12 songs, but 2 of the songs, I have heard many times over the last 2 years, and I didn't like the new versions of the songs. So while they have serveral great new songs, this is a real mixed bag for me to rate it above a 3 stars. Had they redone 2 of there other older songs I would have given this a 4. I just never really cared for Gravitate, and Sigmund."
1,minus 5 stars!,"So much for the ""100% NO-RISK Quality Guarantee!"" My printer (which is listed as compatible on the box) does not recognize the cartridge, and, there is no answer at their 1-866 number."
5,"* Fantastic, Helpful, Encouraging *","I got this month for my four month old and we're showing her the signs early. It's great though because even though she's a little too young to fully learn signs,she LOVES the book! Something about the pictures and the way it's put together,she adores looking at it!I've seen alot of signing books on the market and this one by far takes the cake. It's concise,gives you the information you want without filler that you don't need.And it's easy! Honestly,I'm so fumbly I was afraid I'd be teaching them all wrong but with notes on how to do it correctly,common mistakes and pictures of each movement,you can't mess up!It's wonderful really,VERY recommended!!!-Megan Melvage"
5,Nice place to start......,"Easy to read. Clear illustrations showing how to do signs. Everything you need to get started signing with your baby. Includes answers to many questions you may have concerning signing with your baby, suggestions as to how and when to introduce certain signs, some of the authors personal experiences with her own children, and a list of other resources as well. I would most definately reccomend this book to those that have little to no experience in signing that are interested in doing so with their little one."
3,Great info..not enough signs...,The information is great in this book. I feel that it is worth the money I spent on it. I do wish however that it had more signs. I did a lot of research to find a good book with more signs and I found a book titled Teach Your Tot to Sign. The author is Stacy Thompson. It is a dictionary more than an instructional book. It has well over 500 signs in it just for young children. I think that you should buy this book for the how-to's and the other for further signing. Good job.
3,Nice book but VERY brief,"I'm surprised by all the high ratings. This is a nice little book, but there are very very few signs. It's supposed to be a basic book but I still think it's way too light on signs. For the same price range, there are much more comprehensive books out there. Since we're essentially talking about learning a new language, a mere couple of dozen of signs doesn't really cut it. It'll get you started but you'll need to buy another book later."
5,excellent,bought for my new grand daughter and my daughter is using it already and baby is only 4 months old.
2,not enough signs,"I liked the introduction of the book, but I found that it really lacked in the number of signs that it gave (didn't even have a sign for brother). After reading it, I now need to get a different signing book to be able to continue signing with my baby."
4,Really nice folio,"Pages don't really lay flat, but good enough. Be careful. I split apart one of the outer corners of a page fairly easily, pulling out an ad it came in with."
5,Fun!! And literary!! add a bag of chips and you have the Trifecta,"I love Vic's work. Neither the characters nor the writer take themselves too seriously. The main character is aware of his flaws, accepts and works with him. Good characterization over all, and I really cared (and didn't already know!) what would happen! A great read!"
2,Non-Starter,"I enjoyed Gischler's ""Suicide Squeeze"" -- gave it five stars, in fact, but this one was a stinker. I didn't even get past page 75. Totally unrealistic. Characters are no better than comic book characters. The premise of the plot was wildly unrealistic. I understand that this is supposed to be a dark comedy book, and that the reader should just go along with the zaniness but there's gotta be some connection with reality. For instance, there are two deaths early in the book and the reaction of the other characters is totally unrealistic. Goodbye Gischler."
3,Super Reader,"This book is definitely an improvement on the second. Fox was getting the hang of it.Kothar loses his sword to an emperor, and has to go on a quest with a thief to get the key to a dimensional portal.All doesn't go well and he ends up chained to a dancing girl, fighting a giant bear.A bit of otherworldly travel follows in that adventure.In the second part, the witch Red Lori from the first novel has done a deal with a demoness to possess the daughter of a friend of his, and he has to agree to free the witch from her silver cage to release the girl."
1,"Too Many, Many Narratives","This book would have been good had the writer let the characters speak for themselves. There was very little dialogue for a 550 page novel. Chapter and chapter filled with nothing but narratives which makes it a slow and drawn out read. I, too, had to read into the first 200 pages before the story started to connect. It would be good for the author to practice backdrop into storylines to get to matter of the story swifter. Took me over a month to finish this one when I usually finish a novel within two or three days. Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish it."
1,Long and Boring,"I thought this book was too long and boring. It took forever for the characters to develop. The storyline was ok but not that eventful. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It will surely put you to sleep. I have read other positive reviews on this book, however; I'm just wondering if they were reading the same book? I just hope her second book Fever is better. I won't give up on you yet Ms. Grosvenor"
2,A Huge Disappointmet,"I must say, I had high hopes for this book after a friend of mine suggested it. It took me a while to get through it, which is not like me. The book is slow to read and while the author establishes character development she includes alot of unecessesary details about the characters. I was left wanting more and did not really like the ending."
5,Dom I finished reading the book!,I enjoyed the read...it kept me excited about what would happen next in the various relationships throughout the entire read. I particularly learned from Nina. I enjoyed Troi's character as well. Troi proved to be god sent. I would love to see what becomes of Nina and Tim in the Sequel. I would also love to see how Dakoda grows up and what becomes of her outlook on life.Keep up the great work!
3,It Was Okay,"I think Grosvenor has the potential to be a great storyteller if she squashes all that narration. I'm a dialogue person and the endless third person on and on and on just about killed me. Less similes and metaphors, more interaction between the characters please!"
2,Very Boring Read,"This book was so boring; it took me a month to finish it. It just didnt flow the way the story was supposed to. I know the author is talented, but this book did nothing for me. Thumbs down!"
4,Intriguing!,"I read this in 2000Thank you L. Grosvenor for your page turner. The characters: Nina, Tim, Troi, Vaughan, Rochelle and the Hallelujah girls were developed to the point I felt I knew them all, well.You dealt with everyday issues of black folks, looking for Mr. Right, the playa, black women and weight and hair, and the seemingly perfect marriage. You dealt with bi-sexuality in marriage which is taboo for American black culture. It was a great novel that kept me very interested. I do appreciate the fact that the characters were rooted in the Black church and Christianity. You gave us a message from God. I recommended this book for my book club selection."
1,Boooooriing!,"I read this book in the days after my surgery and it could put me to sleep faster than anesthesia. Too much narration into the characters past. Slow, slow, slow. I can't believe some readers gave this book 4 to 5 stars! I don't recommend this or FEVER which is just as slow."
2,ok...,"The book was alright, it would've been better if it didn't take so long to get to the point. And what does ""Like Boogie on Tuesday"" mean anyways? I personally didn't get it."
3,Like Boring on tuesday,...This book is a very very slow start. It has fourpeople who has alot of drama to deal withbut by the time the author get to the point you willwant to throw this book away. the first 170 pages islike watching paint dry then it has a little sparkbut this book has no fire to it at all. The last 150 pages of this book is o.k. that is why I gave it a three the next book this author writes I hope she does not put information in there that know one cares to know
3,IT REALLY WAS NOT A BOOGIE FOR ME,Like Boogie on a Tuesday was written in small print because the book is small it self if you know what i mean from those of you who already read the book it was just to confusing with the family dram with Troi and Nina and there mother the drunk. Vaughn Troi's husband neede a swift kick becaus he was just out of control but Troi is good for hanging in there I guess that's why it was just a story because us SISTAHS will not put up with that crap. Nina she just needed to stop worring about what about thought about her and just be happy with herself. Like boogie on a tuesday was interesting but not a favorite.
5,Excellent,"This book is ""Excellent! It breaks down the information to grammar school level. What more can I say. One has to practice a lot of problems for it to Stick in your head."" The same for the other book, ""Dr. Math Gets You Ready for Algebra, which should be read First, and take notes [regardless of the fact that you now own the book, Take Notes]. Plus there are ""Flash cards included in the book!""Arivle L. Griffin"
1,I am highly disappointed .,"I am highly disappointed because I have not collected any book up till now. The sememster is almost going to the middle. I even regret the whole thing. I dont have the text book to read for the class.Pls put me in your position and ask your self that, how will you cope without a text book to have good grade at the end of sememster. Anyway! It is too late already because i have to buy another book because I dont want to fail this class.Therefore, I need your help in getting my money back. Pls help me get my money back."
3,BIG Sugar Bowl,"I didn't quite realize how big this sugar bowl was. A little too big for my use. If I reach into the cupboard to get it with one hand I feel like it's likely to slip. I can barely get my fingers over the lid and still hang onto it.I use a lot of sugar, but this is just a bit too big for me. I found a smaller sugar bowl and I'm using this one for cotton balls in the bathroom."
1,could not install,"I really was looking forward to installing this program, but it just did not work.if you have windows xp or higher, don't bother."
1,New book with short of pages in the middle.,Brand new book is defective. There are few pages missing in the middle of book. Seems like defective book is packed like new and sold out. No wonder why It is cheaper than retail price.
5,innovative,"I've been a fan of rick's for nearly 12 years now and his new sound on this album was welcome. It was about time his talent was used for something other than belting out forgetable pop diddies. Although this is a lot smoother than anything he's ever sung before, it showcases his milk chocolatly voice. The change is welcome, Rick."
4,His freedom album from formulaic pop!,"I call this album from Rick Astley his freedom-type album. Free from the formulaic verse-chorus-verse dance pop that he had to sing with the hit machine producers of Stock Aitken Waterman. In its place is a more streamlined live sound for him. When I first heard Cry For Help, I went nuts! I was shocked, and still am to this day. One of Astley's best vocal performances and performing with piano, a live band and a gospel-like choir at the end. Astley sounds good on this album, as he and the producer of Go West's songs produced this effort. I like the danceable Move Right Out. Many of the songs are more personal and you can tell that Rick wrote most of the songs. I still think that his '93 album is the best, but this is a close second to me. Brilliant pop album!"
2,Puke.,FREE should be free. I didn't know this CD would be this bad. It is no wonder Rick's career crashed after this. It will be donated to charity.
4,free at last!!,"so ricks 3rd album is a different course i think more personall course that the pwl albums.it starts great with the ones you love a michael mcdonald penned song witch really suits rick vocals very soulfull!than the masterpeace cry for help!wonderfull sound and gospel backing rick at his best!move right out is a dark moody r&b; track good horns there.be with you and really got a problem are the 2weak point of the album not music for rick astley.is this really love is powerfull rock/soul great horns!!this must be heaven is a good song with powerfull vocals.never knew love reminds me a bit of september(rythim)of earth wind&fire;,the bottom line is a good selfpenned attempt to recreate the50's big band style.than the 2great ones wonderfull you is great soulfull ballad with super instr. backing and behind the smile is very sensitive stripped down ballad with just rick and elton john on piano.good albumnicoreall"
4,One of the best games I've played with my girls!,"My girls and I REALLY enjoy this game! I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it! The only thing I wish they had were replacement cards or extra cards you can buy. We play it so often that the repeats are starting to get lame. This game isn't just for little girls either. My 16 y/o step son has played, my hubby has played it and it's great fun for the whole family!! I actually LOVE this game, maybe even more than the kids do!! :) Again, I only wish they had extra cards, it's does get old playing the same wishes over and over (yes, we really do play it that much)...fun for the WHOLE family!! I seriously recommend this game, especially if you're sick of monopoly and all those other overated board games. In this game you actually learn more about yourself as well as the people you love who you are playing with. You learn what their interests are etc.. If you buy this game you won't be disappointed!!"
1,Not a smart purchase,"My 9 year old granddaughter begged for this game for Christmas. She said it was all she wanted for Christmas! I couldn't find it anywhere so I ordered it on line. I wasn't sure what kind of game this was for $100 but I bought it anyway as grandmothers do. (My granddaughter had played it at a friend's house). Christmas Day she opened the game, said thanks, put it back in the box and it is still sitting there at my house. Maybe this summer we'll pull it out and figure out how to play it. I wish I had saved my money."
4,4 stars,I like this game and reccomend it for girs 10-12ish. it's a game where you put a card into a person's slot which you think they would like best. your card gets rated and that's how you score points. it's pretty fun.
4,"At last, a quality board game.","What a fun game that makes you think at the same time. A gift to my 7 yr. old granddaughter, she and her mom and I (grandma) played it twice while she was visiting me. The categories of game cards and the wishes on the game cards are thought provoking, humorous and require some imagination on the part of the players...a great educational game for young girls without being too slow paced, boring or complicated. My only disappointment was that it takes a minimum of three people to play the game rather than two."
2,"Great fun game, but was not in poor condition.","The game is fun, it's just that it arrived in very ""used"", scuffed-up condition. The ribbon pull was stuck as it was bent. The packaging was fine, the game box was just so scraped/dirty and it appeared as if tags were pulled off so it left marks."
4,Good game for girls.,"I don't remember the age range for this game, but I would recommend 10 and up. I played this with my daughter and her friend. Some of the wishes had to be explained, because the girls had never heard of some of the things. Like, ""Hosting a Charity Ball."" But over all this is a good game, you learn a lot about your friends in a short amount of time. I think she will be able to play it for years to come. A really good sleep over game."
3,"Fun game for girls, Whoonu is much better","This is a cute ""get-to-know-you"" game that is a lot of fun for a group of up to four girls. With the game being geared to girls, my two daughters (ages 7 & 12) had fun playing with various friends and family. It's disappointing that you are limited to four players though and the ""diaries"" that hold the tiny cards and keep score are rather awkard and slow the overall game down. Whoonu by Cranium is a much better game with a similar premise that allows for up to 6 players and faster rounds. Also, more gender friendly for the dads and brothers to join in the fun."
4,That Special Part of Me Onaje Allan Gumbs,"Thanks a bunch ! Been looking for this since my move to the U.S. I really like the songs esp ""All MY Love For You"" which is reminiscent of my childhood years."
4,Great toy for the price!,Great price for a laptop for a kid. I bought this for my nephew because he is usually trying to steal anyones laptop he sees. He is only 2 1/2 so I think he is still just a little to young but soon will be able to understand most of the games. The only thing I wish was different was that the screen was color instead of black and white.
5,learning toy,Bought this for my grandson for Christmas. He loves it. Very sturdy. He tells everyone that now he has a puter also
3,Would be a Fabulous Toy If It Was Made Better,"Based on the other reviews we purchased this laptop for our two year old son. When he opened it, he was super excited and absolutely loved it. There are certainly a good variety of activities that the toy can perform and we could really see how a toddler could enjoy using this toy for at least a couple of years. The big problem though is that the sound stopped working after a couple of weeks even though it was not harshly treated."
3,Good labtop just wish it was in color,I hoped this would help keep my toddler away from my labtop but she really likes the color monitor on my labtop compared to the black/white monitor on her labtop. Besides that everything else on the labtop is great.
4,Over-Priced,Did not do my homework this time. On-line price was nearly double in-store prices. Good toy!
1,Vtech toys contain BPA and PVC,"I have posted elsewhere, but feel I should post this again: I just received a response from the company that to me is subpar given that these toys are in the mouths and hands of babies and children and contain BPA and PVC. I've read the research on both materials and conclude that I don't want my child to be exposed to either, especially on a daily basis. As these items are made in China and not rigorously tested, I am afraid to know what goes under the radar. I also feel this glut of cheap, plastic material is not good for the earth."
4,whatever,The little fellow seemed very interested and enjoys playing with it his Gma states he looks for it when he comes to her house
2,Beware - not 2010 version!!!,"2 stars because I ordered this one specifically because it said """"2010 version"" but what arrived was the newer one. I paid a few bucks more specifically for the older version and now I need to spend more to return!Buyer beware!"
3,Good Toy,"toy i good, my nephew who is 18mts old loves to play with it. the screen however is poor quality should be coloured and bigger"
4,Good one for 4 years baby..,My 4 year daughter is enjoying a lot with her own Laptop.. Also she is spending good time with it by learning alphabets and numbers..
3,Not as good as expected,"When I ordered this laptop, I had very high expectations. However, they did not materialize, because the laptop turned out to have a VERY SMALL SCREEN, where you can barely see. The quality of the picture is extremely poor and the mouse is not a very comfortable one for my son."
3,Good for 3+,"This is a neat, well made, durable kids computer. I wanted a computer that my 2-2.5 yr old could mess around with while I'm on the computer...she will for a little while, but she's too young to understand how the mouse, game options, etc work. She's more interested in turing the volume up and down, hitting buttons, and moving the mouse. I'm not sorry I bought it b/c she does ask for it when I get on the computer, but she's too young to really use it. The letters are listed in ABC order - I understand why, but part of me wishes they were laid out like a real computer since this isn't for 'babies'...help them learn skills they will use later. The volume is a little loud and annoying, but if you can sneek your hand in to turn it down a little, it's not worse than most toys...future manufacturer improvement would be to adjust the volume so it gets very quite and won't get too loud. I like the handle and how the mouse nests under the toy."
4,Lots of fun but a few durability issues.,"We've had this laptop for ages & both our kids have had a huge amount of enjoyment out of it. Unfortunately, the mouse button stopped working. Our kids soldiered on through that by playing the games that used the keyboard, but then the speaker stopped working too. I took the laptop apart to see what was wrong & the fix was pretty simple, if you can do some basic soldering. Here's my blog post on the fix (I'll go into more detail if anyone would find it helpful):(Edit: do a web search for the words ""fangletronics"" and ""vtech"" to find the post - It seems I'm not allowed to insert links in the review)I only realized how much fun my kids have been having with the laptop after fixing it; they were over the moon when they found it in the living room working properly (after about 5 months without it). They've been playing with it pretty much non-stop for the last 4 days!"
5,could not be better!,"I think this thing is amazing! We bought it in 2008 and its still running as good as it did then.My 4 year old son loves his and loves to sit and learn his letters and numbers and play the games. This has been tru a lot over the years, has traveled everywhere and has fallen, bumped and been thrown more times then I can remember and it still works.My baby girl was playing with my sons as soon as she could crawl and afcourse he didn't like her touching it so we bought her her own pink version and we are just as happy with that one too and so is she eventhough she has no clue what she is doing on it yet."
4,Fun,This computer has a lot of learning games on it. My three year old grandson isn't interestesd as of yet so we really can't say much about it.
1,Disappointed,"I'd gotten this for my son for Christmas because he wanted so badly to play on dad's laptop. I thought this would be perfect and it might have been if it had lasted long enough. Just a few months after getting it the button on the mouse quit working with no other alternative in being able to choose an activity. Because of that, the product ended up worthless. There's no way to replace the mouse so it became little more than a box for my child. So very disappointed."
4,Fun so far.,"I bought this for my son's second birthday. While he is a bit young for this toy, he loves to turn it on and press the keyboard. He doesn't quite understand how to point and click the mouse yet, but it is a good distraction when he wants to play with our computer. My nephews were over and they are 4 and 7 and they loved it. I do like the fact that I can go online for more activities, but I don't like that you have to go online to see the report card. That should be available without going online."
1,My son just plays with my tablet.,My son plays with my Acer tablet all the time and I have apps for him. We received this toy as a present recently. It does not compare to the tablet graphics/ease of use/and versatility.Tablets are much more pricey. But I wanted one for myself and as a huge bonus he loves it as well.If you want to invest in a tablet for yourself I suggest getting some apps for you toddler and skip type of purchase.Preschool monkey lunchbox app is awesome.
3,"Constant, Annoying, Melody Music In The Background Playing","I bought this and the pink one at a Black Friday sale. Once it was turned on, the volume had to be adjusted. It was still loud, so I placed my hand over it to lower the volume. I'am going to try to lower it with a little clear tape. This has been a success in the past, when I placed some tape on other toys. Other reviewers are correct about the screen being too dark and small. My biggest complaint is the melody that plays during activities that cannot be shut off. It is annoying and I feel that my grandkids will become distracted by it, while they are learning the activities. I talked with an agent at VTech, but she was not helpful much in correcting the problem.If somene knows how to turn the constant music playing off, please let me know if there's an option to do this."
4,Price,I got this in Amazon but later found that it's cheaper in Walmart. No concerns on the product quality except for this. Product is really good and useful for kids.
3,V-Tech Computer,Definitely too old for the age group they say it is for. Nice computer and sturdy but will be a while before my granddaughter will be able to use it. I even had to look at the directions to see how to use it. Too many buttons to push before you get what you wanted.
4,VTech does it again!,"VTech's Tote 'N Go Laptop is a wonder! I purchased it for my 3-year old grandson for Christmas. It turned out to be his favorite gift even beating out Santa's gifts! The educational value is superior. Although 3-year boys may be a little too hyper to sit patiently through each activity. However, the little laptop also seems durable enough to hold up while my grandson grows up and into it further.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this toy."
5,Good choice,Our daughter who is 27 months old can't keep her hands off it. She loves it and it keeps her occupied for long periods of time which is quite unusual for her. I have started to teach her some of the functions and she is learning some herself. Great choice for a gift. Lori 08
4,AnQuetta,"This is the best toy that I got for my 2yr old, he plays with it for hours on end. He is learning his letters and numbers. It is so exciting to him that he has his own laptop"
4,Too young,"My grandson is too young to use it right now, we will try at a later date and see how well this works for him. He seems to enjoy playing with the computer at this moment and we thought that if he had his own he would be a lot happier! Big mistake for right now"
1,I hate this toy more than any other she's had,I hate this laptop. I got it for my 3 yo and it is way too complicated for her. Everytime I give it her she gets frustrated. The process of selecting activities took ME ages to figure out and I have a PhD. The music on it is dreadfully annoying. The sound drives me batty. The screen is tiny. The supposedly fun character (squirrel) is hard to make out. Did I mention I hate it? I want my money back.
1,Toy for Toddlers,"I had no idea that there were different types of Tote n' Go Laptop. My son had one, similar colour and everything but somehow it stopped working because he kept on dropping it. So I decided to buy another. When the product come, it was totally different from the first one....it sounded different and the keyboard was different. My son hates the product and never uses it. I wish I could find the original one that he had and enjoyed so much."
1,Vtech tote n go plus and Amazon,toy broke in one week . took amazon forever to get it here and i paid for three day service .
1,Packaging ruined Christmas morning,"Amazon packaging is a brown box. Nothing like a 2 year old opening a brown box on Christmas morning. Had I known it would come like this, I would have never ordered from Amazon. Keep the brown boxes for adult items when the person can read...keep the normal packaging for the kids...or at least warn the parents so they know to shop elsewhere. Last kids toy I will buy from Amazon."
3,broke in 2 weeks,My 3 year old girl is not rough with her toys but the mouse broke within 2 weeks... I am going to contact vtech but I am upset because it is her favorite toy and for it to break so fast is ridiculous.
4,Laptop is amazing,"My 19 month grandson loves this laptop. Some of the activities he is not ready for yet but he can pick out the upper case letters and the numbers when prompted. When he gets a correct answer he raises his hands like the monkey and says yeah, yeah. It's so educational and easy to use. I'm amazed that he knows this stuff when he is so young. Loved it so much I bought for the 1 year old granddaughter for when she is ready!"
2,Sound Broke In Less Than 1 Week,"I bought this for my 3 year old nephew's birthday. He liked it even though he had some trouble understanding how to use it. His 4 1/2 year old brother liked it better because he could figure out how to play the games. Unfortunately, the sound broke after a couple of days, and their mom is going to try to return it to the store for a refund. I saw that another reviewer had the sound go out as well, and other reviewers had problems with the mouse not working. This toy is based on a fun concept, but it isn't very durable and may be better suited to ages 4 and up."
2,Great Gift for the Passive Aggressive Shopper,"Like many, I had high hopes for this toy. Electronic and musical toys generally don't bother me, but this one has the most horrible noises when the child misses the question. The games are difficult to figure out how to use, so my child would just push buttons (which resulted in more horrible noise). This toy also has a Spanish option at a push of a button. While this may be a great option for many children, my child has autism and it became a huge power struggle to help him play the game appropriately. Not only do I not understand what is being said, the missed questions result in more of the horrible noise! I wish that the feature was set up so that it wasn't so accessible."
3,Mouse Part Falls Off Constantly,"I thought my daughter who is almost 4 would love this but she doesn't. It has 30 different games/challenges but since kids her age can't read much it's too much for her to figure out which ones she likes, etc. Some of the choices are really dull too. The part I hate the most is the side part where the mouse is falls off constantly which makes it not as portable as I had hoped."
2,Not accurate - Cpmplete Disappointment,"This laptop is a big disappointment for me. As a parent of a 4 year old I find this a poor choice at any age. The keyboard has the letters ordered across in alphabetical order, not as real keyboards are. This I strongly feel is going to confuse children of 3 years or up for their future use of computers. This perhaps is okay for children 18 months to no older than 36 months. Mouse also is not accurate but works. The graphics are very poor as others stated and difficult to see since not lit at all. Even the audio is poor. It is garbled enough that we cannot determine if the man said c,e,b or d because you it all sounds the same just something eeee. Cannot tell if it is bah eee, da eee, sss eee etc.Not something I would recommend for child of any age."
5,Excellent,"Since my daughter got this for Christmas is a toy that she has been using every single day! She is only 29 months toand it can be a little bit hard for her to understand that she needs to move the little mouse in order to select an activity but with mommy help she has been playing and reviewing her ABCS, numbers, shapes and playing some logic games. It is a great toy I know we can use for a long time!"
5,It's great!,"My 2 year old nephew is always wanting to use my laptop and my sisters laptop and my brother in laws laptop. Now he has one of his own and he was REALLY excited about it. The games are still a little too advanced for him to really play, but he doesn't care, he loves it and it's still in one piece. He's able to play some of the games if we play with him and it makes it educational for learning letters and numbers (but we have to be playing with him)."
4,work time,I got this for my 2 Year old niece because she is with me during the day while her mom works and when i pull out my laptop to get some work done she pretends to type on the table so i figured this would be perfect for her.my only problem is it can be a little loud.
1,WRONG PRODUCT,"Reviewing different laptops I finally chose this one for my 21 month old son BUT when I recieved it it wasn't the preschool one (the one thats pictured), just the normal tote and go, cheaper and fewer activities. I'm sure it's a great product and I'll review again once I get the correct laptop but just make sure if you're paying $41.99 you get the laptop worth $41.99 and not the $14-$16 one."
5,"Nice, Fun, Cheap Toy!","I bought this for a really great price here on Amazon. I know my 2 1/2 year old is going to love opening it on Christmas morning! It has a lot of educational activities. Overall, I think it's a good buy."
2,Surprised at the high rating,"We've had this product for a few years now. It's been passed down from one daughter to the next and neither has shown more than a passing interest in the dull low res grey and black graphics this 'laptop' offers. There are a variety of games to play on it and things to learn, but even as a computer savvy adult it's not obvious how to navigate through this thing. I'm writing this review because I saw this toy had such a high average rating. I honestly believe it deserves nothing better than a 2."
2,Good as a pretend laptop,My 16 month son uses it as a pretend laptop. It is hardly useable even for me - so I do understand his frustration with it. But he goes back to it once in a while thinking he will get it like everything else that takes time!
2,Fun for kids until it breaks...,"This is not a durable toy. My daughter loved her's, but it broke after two months. The mouse was never very accurate, and then it stopped working altogether. Without the mouse, you cannot choose the activity you want. My daughter was never rough with this toy. She just sat in front of it pushing the buttons. I would not recommend this product."
5,this toy is really cool!,"im glad i bought this toy... it does alot when learning #'s, abc's, shapes...this toy is very helpful...dont leave it on without use because u'll run the batteries down...but very useful and fun!!!! not 2 complicated...its pretty simple!!"
3,Not impressed,"We purchased this to occupy our son instead of using our laptops. The screen is not in color and can be difficult to see. NOt very engaging. The screen is too small. Also, it is difficult to figure out how to change activities for a two year old. The mouse is a little touchy and difficult to use. It is better for a child age 3 or 4 I would say."
1,Poor screen graphics,"I purchased this toy for my 3 year old son becuase he loves to play CD games on our laptop at home. I wanted something portable and thought the ""keyboard"" , flip up monitor and working mouse was a great idea. i purchased this w/o seeing or testing the actual toy in a store first. had i done that, i would have realized the graphics were poor (very poor). sometimes it was difficult making out the animal that was being depicted. the screen is small and in black and white. OK for the price, but with the current graphics of the Leapster and Mobi-Go products, i'll put the rest of the $ toward something that won't strain my son's eyes trying to play. cute concept, but they really need to update the graphics in this day and age."
3,Adult Assistance Required,"My Grandson at two was not able to really enjoy this. Granddaughter at four could get through some of the games. This is not a game you can just hand over to children who cannot read. It requires adult supervision most of the time. The children are now 3 and 5 and beginning to enjoy it. It is most suitable now for the five year old as she is beginning to read and can remember what key does what. It is a great toy for learning but you do need to sit with the child constantly under five and at five they can get going on the games once you help them find it. The screen is small and looks somewhat like an etch a sketch. But for the price, it works. I think now at five that child will be able to take this in the car and play."
3,Great Toy but Phonetics are mispronounced,"My daughter just received the Vtech Tote 'N Go Laptop Plus as a gift. We haven't fully explore the toy yet but one thing I noticed are the Phonetics that are mispronounced. V-tec should have consulted an educator about the sounds of the letters coz the following are incorrect: L, M, N, R, V, & Z. The toy pronounced it as lu, ma (mu), nu, ru, vu, & zu. vtech are teaching wrong phonetics to the kids.Other than that, the screen is too small, the mouse is also small and my daughter is having a hard time manipulating the mouse.The rest of the games are educational. I still have to wait and see if this toy will really last. Maybe there are better laptops out there."
1,Not durable enough for children. Poor quality.,"We bought the Vtech tote and go laptop plus for our son for his 3rd birthday October 27th from Kohls.This weekend, March 5th, the button on the mouse came off and we can't get it to stay on. It doesn't look like any pieces broke, so I'm not sure why it came off.Today I exchanged it for another one at Kohls and when we got it home, the new one doesn't play sounds. I turned the volume all the way up, but still no sound. This is really disappointing because it is a fun learning tool and my kid loves having his own laptop just like mommy and daddy. He will be very disappointed to no longer have one.This was my first and last Vtech toy that I will purchase. Their product durability and quality is poor."
4,Vtech - Tote 'N Go Laptop Plus,"This is a great educational toy for toddlers as long as parents realize they will need to fully assist their child in using it, especially at first. I think this is a great learning and bonding tool and would recommend it to anyone who wants to spend quality time with their child while making learning fun."
2,Good only for child with patience,"My 3 year old son had child laptop which got misplaced. I researched and this looked like a good option specifically based on reviews. My biggest problem is that response time of this laptop is high for most activities. For example, press A , and it would respond to key press with animation ignoring other key presses for next 3 seconds till it finishes the animation on screen. This is problem in most of activities not all, so it is software issue.Otherwise it would be very good child laptop."
3,Not what we expected,"We bought this computer a while ago and reciently got it back out for our 2 1/2 year old. Back when we bought it we didnt really play with it that much. Now that hes getting intrested in playing we have found many difficulties. One screen is too small, its in black and white but pixly, its really hard to see what game and such you are playing. But it is really sturdy, he has dropped it many times and it still works. Although it wont work if its cold."
5,Toy will grow with your toddler,"We got this for our son for Christmas. He just turned 3 so there are just a few applications that he can play with at this point but we love that it will grow with him and he'll be able to use this toy for a very long time. It also satisfies his need to ""check his e-mail"" and keeps him from trying to get to our computer :) This is the first V-tech toy we have owned and I'm thinking of getting him more because they are so well made and well thought out! Great product!!"
4,laptop review (Vtech),This was an interesting toy even for a very young boy. The communication was instrumental in gaining his attention. It was interactive and would be very good for teaching the appropriate age group as it requires input from the child. I only wish the screen was more visible and had more to offer than black and white sketch images.
4,Easy pseudo-ethnic,"I picked up this album at the Smithsonian, as an impulse buy. I am very impressed. I know nothing about Ms. Therese's recording history, but this album is rich in Native American traditional instruments and feel, blended into a modern mellow sound. The perfect album for quiet talk in front of a roaring fireplace, or a relaxing drive in the country. I put it in the CD player at the office when I want to shut the rest of the world out."
2,Warrior of the Heart,The only two songs I like on the CD is Song for Sean and Peyote Love Song.I was disappointed in the rest!
2,Whatever happened to craftmanship?,"I bought this set as a gift for my son, and the three wood and the driver split off the shaft within the first ten days after only a few uses. These clubs should be noted that they are what they are, which is cheap and cheaply made. Do not buy these if you want something that lasts."
4,Glad I Picked It Up,"This novel by Eva Rutland was something that I just happen to see in the bookstore needing something to read on a train ride. It was a great read and for someone born in the 1970's it gave another aspect of the ""high fallutin'"" people blacks for the 1940's. The ""n"" word was used often so for those that are a bit sensitive to the usage...just a warning. It didn't take anything from the book or the author and I suggest that you still read the book. Great work Ms. Rutland and I'll look for future works!"
1,Typographical errors in edition for iPad,Surely the printed editions of this book would not contain the many typographical errors that the version for an iPad has! These are very distracting and I wonder why I and other iPad users should have to put up with it. I would actually like my money back - I stopped reading at the beginning of chapter six.
4,A Memorable Movie,"When I was a kid we went to the drive-in to see this movie. I was so young I never knew what the name of the movie was, but I had strong memories of the German tank and Jack Palance ever since. For all the years after, I only knew I had great admiration for Jack Palance and didn't really care for Eddie Albert. After I stumbled into the name of the movie, bought it and watched it, I realized those opinions of these two great actors were created from watching this movie so long ago in a drive-in. Remarkable plot and good characterization. These fine actors made you live the movie. We'll forever miss them, except in the great work they left behind like this movie."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A bit stagy (you can definitely tell it was based on a play) with a lack of war action that belies the film's title, Attack nonetheless presents a different look at war and is all the better for it."
3,Makes you think what leaders will do to stay safe and in power.,It shows the military as lead by some cowards and idiots. I liked that end. It will make you think twice about the quality of our leaders.
3,Attack,"Great cast, They do an outstanding job. I was a little disappointed in that I though there would be more battle action. However, still rate it a 3.5"
2,rudimentary storytelling,"The spine of this movie is the cowardice of a commanding officer, and the politics that put him and keeps him in that position. The story is told with stick figure characters, dull ""on the nose"" dialogue, and clueless combat scenarios. There are many fine war shows to choose from, this one is marginally watchable and a complete waste of your time."
2,A very average War Movie,"This movie started off ok, but it went downhill from there. The German Tanks looked like trucks with poles as gun barrels and it looked like it had been shot on a backlot in Hollywood. I can think of better movies to spend your money on."
2,Beautifully illustrated and a good reference book,"We purchased this book to use as a reference for homeschooling. It is a good reference book to get a glimpse of information on many different topics. The illustrations are beautiful.The downside to this book is that it treats evolution as a fact. Evolution is a theory that has yet to be proven. That is why I gave it only 2 stars. So if the text treats something unproven as a fact, it causes me to wonder if everything else in the book is really proven to be true.I have no problem with evolutionary content. But I do have a problem when it is treated as fact instead of theory."
4,Very nice!,This is a very nice detailed encyclopedia. Filled with lots of info. Will be using with my home schooled children. Was recommended by the writer of the curriculum I am using.
2,"Pretty book, marginally acceptable science, appalling writing","This book only gets two stars because of the gorgeousness of the pictures. The actual science content is shoddy, and the writing is horrific. Don't be fooled: Kingfisher is owned by a public school curriculum company, and it shares all the same flaws that a text book has.Bitterly disappointing."
3,Kingfisher Science Encyclopedia,The book has wonderful pictures and graphics. However - each subject is merely glanced over with little in depth coverage. It isn't very useful as a study resource unless you like to look at pictures.
1,Note Type M and H xd cards are incompatible with some card readers,"Note Type M and H xd cards are incompatible with some card readers.I have a Fuji camera and bought an xd card type M. But it turns out that type M and type H cards are not compatible with all card readers (even ones that work with regular xd cards) so I have to use my cable and camera batteries to upload photos from my new card, or purchase a new card reader. Ugh!Buyer beware!"
5,512 MB Type M picture card,My teenage daughter bought her own digital camera and I advised her to buy a good picture card that will let her hold thousands of pictures and this fits the bill.
5,Works Great with my Older 3800 Finepix,I was unsure if this card would work with my 2002 model Fujifilm 3800 Finepix. I put the card in and turned the camera on and it recognized it. This card holds 817 pictures at the cameras highest resolution 3M F. It holds over 3000 at 1M. The video seems to work well also with this card even though the instructions say that there may be a problem with the video. The card reader on my HP win 7 PRO also recognized the card as soon as it was inserted. I am going to the coast in Aug and won't have to worry about filling up this card before I get back to download the pics.
2,"As others have indicated, it's fragile memory","I bought an F30 and wanted a decent amount of storage. The first card worked fine for about 50 photos, then I got a ""write error"" from the camera. I subsequently couldn't view any previous photos, as the card registered empty. I tried reading the card in another camera, but it came up unformatted, and I formatting the card, to no avail. Amazon was great about taking it back, and I bought another since the camera won't take any other format. I've passed the 50 picture point and so far so good. Until your particular card proves itself, I'd recommend getting the photos off fairly often."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I purchased this memory card for my Fuji Finepix V10 camera. I took about 100 photos and downloaded them to my laptop. I inserted the card back into the camera and erased all of the photos. When I went to preview mode, the photos were gone (as expected), but I got card ""read errors"". I'm still able to use the card but when I go to preview mode to look at all the pics, I have to skip through 30 boxes with question marks (?). Kinda of annoying...this is the 2nd faulty card I've purchased. I've read on other sites that there is nothing wrong with the camera, but the problem lies within the card."
2,gave me the wrong memory card,I ordered a fuijifilm XD memory card but I recieved an olmpyus memory card. I was disappointed even though it still works for my camera.I am not pleased that they gave me a wrong order.
5,Great memory expansion,"This flash memory was used on a Fuji FinePix camera that came with a limited size internal memory. That had been sufficient taking pictures in the lowest resolution, but the introduction of this memory (at a fantastic current price) greatly expanded the camera's memory, allowing many, many pictures to be taken in higher resolution. A great addition!"
3,Fujifilm XD picture card,The write time seems about the same as the Flash card.The download time is VERY SLOW. It takes more than 3X as long to download as a Flash card.
2,"xD is not the ""best""","Contrary to an earlier review, xD is not the best format for digital storage. It is a proprietary format and NOT necessarily better than SD or CF. Buying a camera just to use xD is not advisable.Wikipedia has a page summarizing xD:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XD-Picture_Card"
5,Did I mention it's a Gig?,"This is a one GB chip that eliminates your search for the nearest or cheapest digital print shop while you are on vacation. I've got the option on my camera for 6 megapixel shots, and I can take almost 700 pictures without a problem. While everybody else is running out of room on their chips and putting in replacement chips, I'm still clicking away!Oh yeah, I almost forgot...chicks dig 1 GB chips!"
4,Useful for the camera,"It's useful and fast, mainly to make movies and take pictures with better quality. If you are not a professional, this card does the job."
2,1 GB TYPE M CARD NOT COMPATIBLE WITH READERS,"I tested the new 1GB type M card (Fuji) bought at Amazon for more than 1 week now. The card itself showed no particular problem for storing pictures and movies as I am using it with a compatible camera (F11 by Fuji).Where problems come is when you want to read the card through a card reader (and not by linking the camera to the computer)!! The 1GB does NOT work in most of the readers! The built-in card reader of my computer wouldn't recognize the card (whereas it has no problems with a regular 128Mb XD). The new multi-card reader I bought especially for reading XD cards has the same problem (and again no problem with regular XD cards).The only reader that seems to read the new Type M OK is the Lexar USB multi-cards reader. So, if you plan to buy the new type M 1GB, beware... Personally I will send it back to Amazon and go for several smaller capacity regular XD cards."
1,It didn't last!,"I used this card ONE time, and now it will not work. WAY expensive for something that doesn't last. One use?? I would LOVE a refund! I'll be glad to send it back to you for a refund."
4,Fuji v Olympus,"The Fuji card is a great memory card except I wouldn't recommend it for the Olympus cameras. Unfortunately, only the Olympus branded xD cards allow the panoramic function to work in their cameras and I needed to be able to shoot panoramic scenes. Otherwise, I couldn't tell the difference and I like being able to store over a 100 photos (using the Super High Quality setting in my camera). For any other camera without the Olympus quirk, I'd recommend it."
5,Worth the Cost,"This is worth the cost. I like the fact that I don't have to worry about filling up my memory when at a wedding or just taking pictures for fun. If you are thinking you will never need that much space, I Would say its better to be safe than sorry. I would rather never fill up the card than to come across one of those rare instances when you need more space."
1,Crashed after the first use,"When I purchased this card, the capacity and the number of pictures you could take at one go seemed intriguing. However, after the first use (and luckily with only 4 or 5 pictures stored on it) the card died and I couldn't even format it. I had to send it back for replacement.Now I'm looking at the similar Fujifilm cards (256MB, 1GB,...) and apparently many poeple have had the same problem.An important recommendation: Do NOT buy a single card with high capacity. Instead of a 512, go for two 256. You will end up paying 10-20 bucks more, but what you'll get is the peace of mind."
4,Works,"It works, but I do have one issue with it. I really don't know if it is my camera, or the card itself, so I don't want to totally blame the card. I just have a problem sometimes when I try to view the photos that took on my camera. I'll put the camera in review mode, and sometimes it tells me ""card read error"". I have to eject it and put it back in when it happens. Again, it could be my camera's problem, but I don't know. I guess I'll know whenever the time comes that I decide to get a different card. I'll experiment by buying a different brand. FujiFilm is also the brand of my camera."
3,"Great deal, but not 100% compatible","Love the pricing, especially with the discount when bought with the Fuji S9000.The problem is because it's a proprietary device. It seems only Fuji use the xD card, so it only works for Fuji cameras. Also it gave me an error message when I tried to download the content via a USB card reader.Maybe it's just my card reader. But it is inconvenience knowing that at times it may not download correctly.I've been accessing the memory card via the camera and it seems to work fine that way."
4,Fujifilm 1 GB,I enjoyed The product. It was of good quality. I have no issues with the product at all. Thanks You
1,Didn't get it!,"Sorry, but I can't give a review on a product I didn't receive. Was charged, but no product!"
1,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with the purchase I made on Amazon. I ordered my item over a month ago! I still have not received my item. There was an expected delivery date, and it has now been over a week since they said it would be delivered by!! I have been charged for the item I bought, and I still do not have it! If it does not come soon, I will never order from Amazon again!"
5,A Keeper.....,"Am very pleased with the bra, I am sold on the Wacoal fit. My only desire would be coverage for the nipples. I have been searching for a bra that would fit comfortably on the shoulders, especially no slippage."
5,...and yet another Saddle Club classic,"This book was really good, since it had one of those strong horse-rider bonds. A horse-lovers must, along with anyone who enjoys adventure and suspense. Another great book to read would be HORSE WHISPERS, Saddle Club #74. Enjoy the books--and the rest of the series!"
5,adam 12 season six,"Clear digital video, great sound, nice packaging, all episodes are in chronological order, very happy to complete the series with the final issue."
5,Great old cop show,Enjoyed this show years ago and it's great to have the series to watch again. It's getting to where this nothing to watch on tv nice to have old shows to watch. Great family series to watch together.
2,Season Six and Seven do NOT include subtitles or closed captions of any sort.,"Shout! Factory has a long history of treating hard of hearing and deaf customers like crap, and it has reached a new low. After providing closed captions for Seasons 1-5 of Adam-12, for some reason they abruptly *dropped* captioning from the last two seasons.Since for almost all DVD publishers subtitles and/or closed captions are included as a matter of course, the absence of those words on an Amazon product description is no longer much of a clue to their absence in the product. So we pretty much need to rely on reviews like these to spot the small number of outliers who refuse to support this segment of their audience."
5,Adam-12 great show from my past,"Loved this show as I was growing up. Without the profanity of today's shows, it provides many hours of enjoyment now. Very much enjoyed the acting of Martin Milner and Kent McCord, William Boyette and the other cast members, the guest star."
3,Not the true Erica,"AMC Fans will question the integrity of the author of this book. It IS NOT Erica. (we know she's a fictional character). But the book is over-the-top even for Erica. Knowing her as well as I do, (20 years), I know that Erica would never go on as incessantly as occurs in this book. Erica doesn't use the verbiage that is used in this book. It's a light piece of fluff that is entertaining, but you know from the first page that the author did not really get into Erica Kane's psyche. I could have done Erica better justice myself"
2,I was disappointed.,"I was so excited when I found out that there really would be a book the fans could read! But I was disappointed because the book was so flippant. It was even too ""in my own little world with NO idea what reality is"" even for Erica. It caused me to resent the fact that my life could not be depicted as Erica expected her life to be. I think this book could have been written from a much more enjoyable and entertaining aspect. The thoughts weren't even consistent throughout the book. When will we get to read Mike Roy's book he wrote 13 years ago about Erica? Hopefully, it will be better. --Susan Westfall, a fan from the 70's."
5,everybody needs one,It is the best thing to have: a disk for your phone. It makes great backup for all your pics and videos.
1,poor,The sound is only coming from left side speakers. I have tried my other blue rays dvd is all are ok except for this Barry M.
5,Great Hi Def video,"This is a great concert that deserved to be in High Definition and hopefully all of his concerts will soon be. If you're a Barry Manilow fan,go buy this one!!!"
3,Disappointed with sound.,I don't what happened in the transfer process with this blu ray. The low frequency in the sound are not there. The picture quality is excellent. Very disappointed. The reason to buy concerts in blu ray is cause of picture and sound quality. I would not recommend it to someone that is into quality like me.
4,Great!!!!!,Excellent Video and sound. Barry does all of his own material plus a few extras. THIS dvd WILL BRING BACK A FEW MEMORIES OF YOUR PAST.
5,this is for fans of Barry Manilow,If you're not of fan of Barry Manilow then you probably aren't going to like the dvd but i am a fan and i liked it a lot. The idiot who gave this a one start review needs to understand that no one cares what a non-fan thinks. We love it because we love Barry. The same way i wouldn't bitch about a AC/DC concert dvd because i'm not a fan and have no right to complain. It's Barry being Barry...enjoy and sing along.
1,Another compedium's much better,"I've had over 1,800 letters to the editor published over the past six years in the local newspapers on issues of the day, and generally try to include a quotation relevant to the specific issue under discussion. I've found the Quotationary (http://www.amazon.com/Quotationary-Ed-Frank-Leonard-Roy/dp/0307290352/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1338624333&sr=1-2) to be a much better volume in having just what I want. The Quotationary's dictionary-style format makes topics easy to find."
1,Quote Book,"This book was advertised 'like new'. I wanted to give it as a gift.What I got was a smelly old book with very yellow pages. I can'tgive it as a gift, I can't even keep it in the house because of itsodor. I just threw it in the recycling bin, I hope they'll take it."
3,Okay.,"The only good song you'd play for your non-ska loving friends on this album can also be found on ""Skarmageddon"" number one,the rest of the songs are technically proficient but lack that certain weird oomph that gives me a tingly-nerd feeling all over."
5,great for smoothies and eggs,"easy low-fat way to thicken a fruit smoothie while adding protein. also good in scrambled eggs, omelettes, etc."
4,A Great Sea Yarn,This short novel has one of the most powerful descriptions of a great storm at sea ever written - you just can't put it down.
4,classic seafaring tale,"this is a dark, but beautifully written story (typical of Conrad's books). It combines both a colorful picture of the hard life of merchant marine sailors and lots of seafaring drama. I don't give it 5 stars because I found the central character's story intriguing but ultimately pointless. You may find it more meaningful."
5,Excellent book written very well,"I expected this book to be heavier and harder to get through than it turned out to be, because of Joseph Conrad's other writing. But it is very readable and extremely well written. I can see why Joseph Conrad is listed among the great authors. This book justifies that.The impression that the author gives about the characters on the ship Narcissus, and therefore about the world in general, is that the people in charge of the ship know what they're doing and are hard working, and the common sailors are a motley crew with some good, a bad apple or two, and not too bright.I agree that mankind isn't too bright. I think that is borne out by all our history books, newspapers, and tv news. But I disagree about the people in charge basically being superior, hard working people. The people in charge of this ship aren't anything to brag about."
5,Encyclopedia,I refer to this a lot. This text book is one of my most valuable purchases as a musician. Highly recommended.
2,rusted in 3 months,"A little wobbly, could be a bit taller, and started to rust within 3 months of use. Unacceptable for a product that holds damp towels to rust so quickly."
3,Handsome piece,This works well in my guest bath. Though it would be better if it was a couple of inches taller. Make sure to only use fingertip towels on this one.
4,looks good,Needed a towel holder next to the sink and placed on a piece of furniture. Works well and looks good
5,Great towel holder,This towel holder fits perfectly on the counter and is a perfect match to the rest of our oil rubbed fixtures. The towel holder was as described and arrived on time.
4,Just what we were looking for,"Just as described, perfect for our bathroom re-do. Holds hand towel or wash cloth. Simple yet elegant, heavy enough that it doesn't fall over with the weight of the towels."
4,does exactly wt we want,does exactly wt we want and looks good in our br. i would recommend to others.dddd
3,"Lovely, But More Brass than Bronze (Looking)","With the exception of the knobs at the ends, this rack has more of a brass shine to it than the deep, dark bronze finish I was expecting. While that was disappointing, I really do love the design of this rack, and when the hand towels are on it, the mismatch in color is far less noticeable."
2,Made in China Junk Weighs 18 Ounces,"The item description says that it weighs 3 Pounds but I weighed mine and it says 18 ounces (1.2 Pounds) and that was on a Digital Scale. So, where's the other 1lb. 14 ounces? It sure didn't go towards the quality of this product because the base of the unit doesn't sit flush so the unit wobbles and when you grab a dish towel, the towel holder almost falls over...you have to be careful. The other thing is the height of the unit, it's not tall enough so your dish towels lay on the counter top. It's also made in China, need I say more? I gave this towel holder an extra star, only because of the chrome finish. I like chrome things, I don't know why but I do."
2,Not tall enough...,"This item is of good quality - sturdy, heavy, well built, but it works only for fingertip towels. For regular size hand towels this stand is too short. I had to return mine."
2,Not tall enough,"I should listened to the other review about it not being tall enough for a standard hand towel. Did more searching, and found another solution for myself, an over the cabinet door towel bar."
4,Great~!,"I have wanted a small towel rack for the counter for many years. Finally found this one and it fills the bill nicely. Very Sturdy and looks great. Wish it were 2 - 3 inches taller, but can fold the hand towels at the top and it works beautifully. Glad I found and would definitely buy again!"
2,Too short,Wish the description gave the height. From the misleading pic it looks like this holder is good for regular sized hand towels but it's not. My hand towels touch the counter when hung.
2,Rather cheap and flimsy.,"Avoid this product! This towel holder is very cheaply made (its not one piece and the parts are always coming loose). A much better quality and less expensive towel holder is the ""InterDesign Axis Fingertip Towel Holder - Chrome"". Do yourself a favor and buy the ""InterDesign""!"
5,A CRIME that it was never captured on VIDEO,"I saw this show live on Broadway when it first came out in 1978. During the two years that I lived in New York City, this was the only show that I ever paid full price to see TWICE, and it was worth every penny. That it was never captured on video is the greatest crime of the 20th century. Nell Carter's performance (then in her late 20's)was nothing short of sensational, and now she's gone.Fats Waller's music is magnificent in its own right. He's one of the greatest musical genuises of the swing era. But this performance brought it to life as it had not been seen or heard in decades, and with all the boldness and cheeky humour that was Waller's trademark.I have a huge collection of Fats Waller's music, and this was the musical that first turned me on to it nearly 30 years ago.And for that, I'm eternally grateful.Let it turn YOU on too."
5,Handful of Keys,"I first saw a TV broadcast of the Broadway production of Ain't Misbehavin' (featuring the original cast) sometime in the 1980s. I just loved the verve and style of the performers, and the way they were faithful to Fats Waller's original intentions for the music and yet brought it into the late Twentieth Century with ease.It's great music to begin with, the performers are wonderful and the arrangements are superb.I only wish there was a DVD of the performance, as the colour and movement only add to the experience of the music on this CD."
4,Lovely Two Toned Earrings for Large Earlobes,"These earrings are gorgeous. Just the right size and two-toned.However, my earlobes are not real big. Therefore, the earring tends to lean forward, because the earring has more weight.I would give Five Stars, if I they would remain balanced. I must adjust throughout the day."
1,Perfect fit is a misnomer,"pretty, but they fall forward in your ear. I have to take mine to the jeweler to be fixed so that I won't lose them. I an now very suspicious of anything in the ""gold box"" because of these earrings. They cannot be worn as is."
3,Not very good quality production...narration good,This must have been produced a long time ago...the quality of production and sound is less than acceptable. There are other dramatized versions. The one I like is the NIV Dramatized both on cassette and CD narrated by Stephen Johnston. It is produced by World Publishing. I recommend that. CDs really make the Bible accessable because you can go to chapter and verse easier. God Bless!
4,Why I rated this book 4 stars....,"Everything is just the way that I expected of this audio book, the only thing that could be inproved upon is, that it should be available in compact disc form and that it would be more enjoyable if it were in a Dramatized Version. After all, since this is one of the most requested versions of The Bible in the NIV form, Amazon.com should carry it in a Dramatized Compact Disc form."
5,An excellent alternative,"I do a lot of driving (4 hours/day) and these tapes help me stay in the Word. It doesn't replace reading the Bible, but when you spend so much time in a car every day it is the next best thing to reading the Word. I like the dramatization in the Gospels and the background music. Also the narrator is very easy on the ears. I would highly recommend this audio Bible for anyone who can't seem to get enough time to read the Good Book."
3,Complete Bible on Cassette,I am fairly satisfied with my purchase but when checking it over I find that there is one tape missing. It is cassette tape number 7 of the New Testement. I don't know if you can do anything about the missing tape or not but I wanted you to know that the set is not complet with one tape missing.I would like to hear of your concern in this matter. I have only made a few purchase from Amazon and been please with the result so far. Thank you for listening to me.Linda Geliske
1,disheartened,"I purchased this set of tapes because I desperately need to find God. I've been assured the search begins with his WORD. This production is an impediment to that search. The words are read without interpretation, sometimes so fast that it is obvious a task is being hurried through. The same characterless music is repeated ad nauseum. Compare this with Max McLean's performances and you will never want to listen to a ""solely for profit"" production like this one again."
1,Uninformed product description,"I ordered these cassettes, and when they came part of the New testement was missing, when I contaced the seller she thought I was referring to ""compact discs"", and not cassettes, and said she indicated that it was missing cassetes in the product description, had that been true I would have never ordered it.(common sense).Extremely dissappointed but thankful that I was refunded for the product, and gave it to a neighbor who is unable to work, so someone got blessed other than me."
1,Terrible! Never got it!,I bought this and they never shipped it to me! They're pathetic! Don't ever buy from here!
3,"Decent sound, some hits missing","This is a great CD, don't get me wrong, but if you are looking for the *one* disc that best covers Glenn Miller's famous charts and signature sound, you might want to keep looking. At 23 tracks, it definitely delivers on quantity but the quality of the sound is only mediocre. Not a lot has been done to ""clean up"" the original masters (which actually might be a positive to many purists) and the sound is a bit distant and bright. There are also some notable exceptions, particularly ""Moonlight Serenade,"" ""Pensylvania 6-5000"" and ""Little Brown Jug."" Of course, the movie soundtrack covers those tunes and is in stereo, though the sound is not as authentic as these recordings."
2,"Ghastly ""Remastering,"" Avoid","RCA/BMG's engineers apparently took fifth-generation tapes of these hits (two stars for the music alone) and then did a putrid job of remastering them. A good vinyl reissue from the 1950s would produce richer, fuller sound than this catastrophe. There are many Miller compilations produced after about 1997, when they finally learned how to remaster from 78 rpm. Seek them out."
5,One of a kind,"Anyone that is a serious collector of 60s psychedelia this is a must have.i owned and still have the original vinyl and can say the CD is a splendid re-mastering. Quality is first rate.i never myself dropped acid in those wild days even though deep into the scene having spent the Summer of Love in Greenwich Village.But i can say i suspect this is the best way to take an acid trip without dropping acid:)Though only just short of 37 minutes it seems longer as it can mesmerize for those that have an ear for beyond the fringe psyschedelia.The Empire of the Sun cut lasts just over 17 minutes and is one whole side on the vinyl. i love the whimsical Ragnorok touch at the end of The Empire of The Suni now recommend the review by Carl Slim that is here, it is a fine review and i can't improve on it.Max90"
2,"Could Mancini Be ""Country?""","Henry Mancini gave us so much of our consciousness of the 1960s and 1970s, and yet was ""out"" almost as soon as he was ""in.""His work became synonymous with much-despised ""elevator music"" in the later 1960s. This stereotype (or monotype, for his earliest works) can mislead.For example, ""Lujon"" [not in this collection] was used in a movie just last year to exemplify mystery and an exotic atmosphere.Mancini died way too young. While some would argue that he'd become a self-parody, his innate gifts compromised by relentless commercialization, you cannot take away his lasting gift to our culture. He was an original, and he captured an essence of our collective experience.He's here in this collection, waiting round the bend, could be my Huckleberry friend. However, what you'll get are elevator arrangements of standard country tunes. The heart and soul are just not there, I'm afraid. Save your money!"
5,Small and Deep,"I've had this little book for a number of years, and everytime I pull it off the shelf I am reminded that important truths do not have to be packaged with fluff. This is a dear, short, helpful pocket companion, that I have a mind to send in the mail to someone who's trying to find their sea legs....The price of a card, but full of help and wisdom."
4,Cattlemen vs homesteaders vs law,"In this opus,town marshall(Randolph Scott)his his hands full keeping trail hands,at the end of a drive from treeing his town. Added to this is an enept sheriff(Edgar Bucannan),a hot headed farmer (Lloyd Bridges)and the town's saloon keepers -who will do anything to make a fast buck"
4,homesteaders vs. cattlemen,Great western about the glory days of the American prarie at the end of the Abilene trail and how they were slowly ground to a halt by outsiders who pushed their way in and wanted change everything to their convenience with the assistance of Government supported law enforcement officials of course.It all erupts into violence and gunfire and someone getting shot.not very dissimilar from the politics of todays modern society of one group of people assembled in an area having good times and harming noOne and then being broken up and run off by todays version of Homesteaders.
1,Awful Transfer,"This might be a good movie, but the quality of the transfer was so awful I'll never know as I threw it in the trash 5 minutes in. Save your money and get another of Scott's wonderful films instead.Note that Amazon has added this review to the enhanced version of the DVD too, which is not the one I bought. Didn't know there was an enhanced version, should have picked that one up instead."
5,Original is the best,Great Western adaptation to the big screen.The quality of the disc is a great transfer.Thanks for the fast shipping too!
4,The Manics' latest is very good !,"Good guitar-oriented, relevant songs played by a tight, focused trio.They are not fantastic (like on ""The Bible"") right now but are still very relevant and very good."
2,Very disappointed,We hate this book and are getting rid of it. We thought it would be great - two dads adopting a kid. What could be better? It actually reads more like 2 dads stealing a child from the jungle. Yuck!
1,Not Worthwhile,"A very disappointing sequel. The tile implies that it will be about the Kings' creating a family, but most of the book focuses on their honeymoon. When the Kings' return from their travels they find a child who hid out in their luggage - then they proceed to adopt her (how about a search for her bio parents?). This book is fuel to the right wing fire and doesn't represent any of the creative ways LGBT people have created families."
1,Not Worth Reading,"I was sorely disappointed in King & King & Family. Readers will have no emotional connection to this story. There isn't any plot; it's just a hodgepodge of ideas and cute illustrations. It's not worth buying. If you're looking for great children's books about family diversity, particularly ones involving homosexuality, I advise ""And Tango Makes Three"" (true story about two male penguins adopting an egg), ""The Family Book"" (guidance), ""Saturday is Pattyday"" (about parent's separating), or ""The Daddy Machine"" (goofy) instead."
1,How did this end up at the Library in the kids section???,"A child's book about two gay men basically stealing a dark skinned baby from ""the jungle"" while on their honeymoon. Really, is it that easy to get a book on the shelf????"
5,bout damn time,"this is a killer killer killer album..i can't use the word killer enough bout this album...it's about time a band did some classic skinhead reggae....even you don't consider yourself a ""reggae"" fan...fans of early 60's soul and r&b should definatelly check this out...afterall it's soul and r&b that influenced all early reggae...this album will be a classic!"
3,meh,"Thought I'd check this band out since reggae is my favorite genre and the Aggrolites will be playing a show in my hometown soon. Unfortunately, it made me realize that I just don't like the sound of the organ... at all. Too bad, I can see the comparisons to Toots & really like some aspects of their sound. Just way too heavy on the organ for my tastes."
2,Not assembled when package opened,"When opening the package, Both burners were not fully attached to the frame. Also, one of the burners was not attached at all to the hose assembly.Luckily the spring and air vent cover was still in the box, and one of the Cub Scout parents on the campout happened to have a socket set with them.Completely missing from the box was the small wrench used to attach the hose to the stove itself."
2,Confused target market,I'm not sure of the market for this book. It's too general to be of use to technical staff and provides too much detail for management or an end-user. Seeing as this is the author's second SAP book - I was expecting more.
3,Good home alone toy,I give this toy to my Blue Heeler to play with while I'm away. It seems to keep him interested and is tough enough to endure some chewing. Probably an out doors toy as it will drive you nuts after a while. If i had to improve it i would give it an off switch rather than the tiny plastic stopper used to turn it off.
5,entertainer of the year,This ball is awesome for entertaining our 8 mo old cocker spaniel. She loves it! She chews on it and tosses it around and it is quite durable. Batteries are easy to replace. Have extra's on hand for continued fun. We will be purchasing this item again and highly recommend it to other pet owners.
1,What is the point of a ball if he can't chew it?,"Hard plastic for a dog toy is not a good idea. I thought the sound would be entertainment enough for my GSD but that proved to be a false assumption. I bought the large and the medium sizes.At first, he was totally surprised to hear a ball talk so he was very cautious. My husband and I played with the ball trying to get him interested in it. Once he realized the ball was not comfortable in his mouth, it was game over."
5,My dog absolutely LOVES it!,"My dog absolutely loves this babble ball toy -- he runs with it from one end of the house to the other, its really cute--my older dog also likes it and he was never a dog who played with toys!"
2,"When the batteries die, throw it away, it's useless","I have purchased about 4 of these because my JRTs love them, and I got one for my granddaughter. However, there is a huge problem with the batteries: they die quickly and are next to impossible to replace. It's difficult to get the batteries out since the screws are so small, and once I got the batteries out, I couldn't find replacement batteries. What do they expect you to do, go to a Jeweler? No, they expect you to replace the ball. Well, my bigger JRT will play sometimes with the dead ball expecting it to come alive again. But the other JRT ignores the dead ball. One is on the shelf since I messed it up trying to get the batteries out. What a waste!"
3,"Does what it says, but it's very annoying.","Like the title says, it's pretty annoying. I think this is a great gift for someone else - not something to buy for your own dog. My little dog was frightened of it, and my bigger dog didn't show any interest in it. It's made of very hard plastic. Makes an ideal throwing weapon."
3,talking ball,This is more of a product for a cat or a child. My grandsons play with it and my dogs won't even look at it. It does have a lot of cute sayings that it says
3,be careful this is very small,This is a great little toy the cats love it the dog hates it but it is very small even too small for a small dog.
5,Pet Toy,Great for engaging dog in play. The first toy our dog chooses to play with independently when on her own. .
5,This just too cool!,The cats bat this around and it talks back to them. I just love it....even when I hear it in the middle of night. Anything that amuses my furry little friends is a wonderful thing.
4,talking babble ball,This is great my dog is a chewed and chews apart all toys but this one has lasted and he has fun chasing it. It is noisy on the hardwood floors
5,petquark talking ball,We have a pit bull dog and so far this is the only toy that he hasn't been able to destroy. And he really enjoys playing. With this ball.
3,Ok for a little while,"I bought this toy for my dog, because he gets bored with toys very quick, or chews them to bits. At first, he enjoyed it a lot, was even thrown by the fact that it talked when he played with it. After a few days, he kinda got bored of it, and I was just annoyed by the talking. It was nice to see him play with something different for a while though."
3,I'm not impressed.,"The sound quality is so bad, it's really difficult to understand to know what it is ""saying"". Small dogs won't be able to do anything besides push it around with their nose; big dogs (I have a pit) could likely shatter it if they bit down too hard (it's very hard plastic)."
1,Not worth the effort,This entire order was a disaster. Animals could not have cared less for it. Too expensive in relation to pleasure it gave.
5,Dogs love it,"I have like 5 of these now. my Lab has never liked a toy so much. they have not been able to destroy it. battery last. even when under the furniture when the dog goes by randomly it will start talking which is fun to give them some random stimulation. Sturdy, long lasting battery."
3,dog loves it but slightly annoying!,"Length:: 0:28 MinsJust so you know what you're in for...I had NO idea. The sad part is that he LOVES this toy, so I just let him play with it in small doses. This way he is happy and I can keep my sanity!"
5,Ball o' Fun,"My cockers have 3 Babble Balls, 2 small and 1 medium. I purchased this for a friend's new Brittany puppy. She loves it and it's the thing she carries with her when she goes in her crate. They are made of hard plastic and have replaceable watch batteries(small takes 3). The small is a little larger than a golf ball and medium is a little larger than a tennis ball. I would suggest care in choosing one large enough, I think the small could be a choking hazard for a large dog. Once my dogs start they don't quit until it rolls under the furniture and they can't get to it. It's sensitive and will activate with very little vibration, like walking by it at night. It is a little loud and repetitive and can be annoying to my husband. It doesn't bother me, I find myself repeating 'Oh, Lucky Dog!!' - 'Here Puppy, Puppy!!' - 'Oh no, EHHHH!' etc."
5,My dog loves this toy,"I only let her play with it for a few minutes each day - so it's always fresh. It seems pretty rugged, but I prefer to supervise her play - she is an avid chewer and toy destroyer. The people in the house enjoy the babble as well."
2,A loser,My little pom a poo was not at all interested in this toy. The fact that it makes human sounds was not a selling point for my dog. I really just wasted my money. Give my dog a box full of old soxs to find and scatter all over the house and he is really happy and old soxs are a lot cheaper!
4,He likes it!,My puppy loves this toy and will play by himself for a long time with it. Glad it's sturdy too.
5,Careful for chewers but mine GO CRAZY FOR IT!,"I have to say, I have 4 french bulldogs and 1 american bulldog. My 3 french bulldogs could care less about this, though, they are mainly chewers- not ""playful""-- the one french bulldog that LOVES this toy the minute I grab it actually SHAKES. I got a size Medium and it seems to work well for the french bulldogs since they can't QUITE get it in their mouth to chew on (sometimes they figure it out to carry it on the bed but most of the time they can't). As for the American Bulldog-- WATCH OUT! She goes NUTS! It's actually the only way we can get her to go anywhere that we normally can't get her to go! She howls when we hide it from her (since its hard plastic, we don't want her chewing on it).I LOVE this toy and wish they made more variations of this!!!! :)"
2,"Had to ""Lose"" this toy.","My little dog likes this OK, but it has won the attention of my cats the most. I do wish it kind of giggled like that giggly ball is suppose to, but it is cute. Very sensitive too. I just walk by it and it talks. It is funny at night or early morning when I hear it talking because one of our cats is playing with it. My dog doesn't chew it, so we don't have a problem with that. Would buy it again.UPDATE 11-19-2012 - We got another dog so I bought one for him. As he played with it, I could hear it knocking on his teeth when he would chase it and pick it up. I was afraid it was going to crack his tooth like those goofy nylabones can so I had to lose this when he wasn't looking. Too bad though, because it is cute. I just wish it was made of a softer material."
2,Bad Product,"This product is very poorly made...My pets had it for 10 minutes and it broke...and little plastics are coming off too.In my opinion, this product is way overpriced. The construction is cheap, made in china, malfunction in 10mins. The cost to make one is probably 50 cents. Beware!!!"
4,Good Idea,"My Maltese doesn't like this toy. He isn't afraid of it, it just doesn't interest him. That being said, I still think it's a great idea. My dog loves all kinds of balls and loves to chase things, so I got this for him but he ignores it. And just so you know, the large, or at least the one I got, is about the size of a tennis ball."
4,Babbling doggy ball,"My doggies love these things. My dog plays with it like there is doggie crack inside it!!! It's hysterical!! This is just a much fun for them as us, however it does get on my nerves after awhile and we ned a timeout. Haha"
4,Talking balls,"Balls came in the wrong size, I ordered a large, which was printed on the blue balls, but they were not the size that was described on Amazon. I have tried working with the company on an exchange for the larger balls, but after several emails, I have not heard from them. My dogs love the toys, just needed a bigger size because I have rottweilers and am concerned that the smaller size will get stuck in their mouth. They had one before and loved the talking balls. If you have a large breed dog, I would be concerned about size, but other than that, your dogs would have hours of fun. Company dropped the ""ball"" when it came to correcting the problem."
3,best toy ever...too bad it broke,"Our dogs LOVED this toy. They played with it NONSTOP, until the sad day who the 2 sections came apart. Gluing it didn't work.This was a sad day for our dogs. :-((((("
3,Can be annoying,Warning..this is not a quiet toy. Much like buying a drum set for your kid. Much louder and annoying then any squeaky toy. No problem with the noise going away so far and have had for a couple of months. Bought for my two German Shepherds but they also seem a bit put off by it. I think they think it is yelling at them..maybe too human of a sound? It does seem durable but I did take the previous suggestion of putting it in a thick sock since it is hard plastic as opposed to rubber. They like the ball aspect of it more than the noise. I think changing the type of noise (currently a cartoon voice)and a lower volume would bump up this one's popularity.
2,Not recommended for chewers,"I purchased this product almost six months ago and have given it time to write this review. As pet owners, we are always looking for a product that entertains and keeps our four-legged friends busy. Especially after a long days work, etc. I have a 38lb. black Spanador (Cocker Spaniel and Lab mix). This breed is high energy and needs to be active much of the time. She is also a CHEWER! I do not recommend this ball for really any dog. No matter if the dog is high or low energy or chews/not chews. In my experience the ball made her more 'spastic' and crazy. I believe it was overstimulating her in a negative way. Also, the ball started to break apart in little pieces after only a few hours. I do not recommend this product. Maybe if the manufacture rubberized it in the tough material that Kongs and other durable products are made out of. I found that walks and fetch still prove to be her favorite past times. They just want to be with us."
2,It was toooooo hard,"My dog Princess loved the Babble Ball,but because it was such hard plastic and hard to keep ahold of,I had to take it away from her,so she didn't end up breaking something(a window,the TV screen...etc.It does not specify in the product description that it was made of such hard materials."
1,didn't work.,A waste of money. It never made a sound from the moment we received it. Came in the mail right away but that's the only good thing about it.
5,A+ Seller,My dog absolutely loves these.We have four dogs and she is the only one who likes them - so I don't think every dogs does.But they are one of her favorite toys.
2,Cool but didn't last,"This toy was a great find or so I thought. My dog loved it. However, it only lasted one day and then it stopped working."
4,Love the noises!,The noises this little ball makes are delightful. The plastic is very hard though and isn't wonderful for playing by itself. We also bought one of the plastic jugs with rope that you put treats in and the dog has to figure out how to get them out. Put this little ball in the jug and you have a dynamite combination!
4,"Fun toy, but it's definitely small!","This toy does what it says it will do, and my dog seems to enjoy it. However the description is correct when it says this is a small toy. I would probably recommend this for dogs under about 15 lbs. only. It's a bit small for my two ~20 lb. dogs - they can put it a little too far into their mouths and I'm worried they may get it wedged in their mouths/throats. It also doesn't quite stand up to chewing as well as I would have expected. It's only been a few days and it's looking pretty beat up already. I gave it a 4 because I think for the right dog (small, not aggressive chewer) it's a great toy. I didn't give it a 5 because I was a little disappointed in the durability, and I won't be able to use it for long with my dogs. I had hoped to leave it with my dogs for some fun and mental stimulation while I'm at work, but I'm careful what I leave them with unsupervised and definitely wouldn't leave them unsupervised with this toy."
4,Stop it from going under couch,My mom got this babble ball as a gift for my maltipoo she loves it !!Only problem is that its so small it goes under furniture .So I ordered a ho-lee roller ball that won't roll under my furnitureAnd I shove the babble ball in it !!
3,Very entertained by it!,My dog loved this toy and was definitely entertained by it! Only problem was that it didn't last long.. he had it chewed up in no time. Probably best if your dog isn't a chewer.
3,Fun for a few days,"This ball was great fun the first few times our dog played with it, but after a few days she became determined to find out where the voice was coming from and began to really try and chew on it. The material is hard plastic so I can't let her play with it all of the time and risk breaking her teeth on this. It still is entertaining to take out once in a while but I probably wouldn't get another one."
4,It's a cute idea!,"My dogs aren't that interested in it. They love noisy toys, but it might be just that it is a hard plastic. I think it is cute, annoying, but cute!"
4,HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT BALL IS SAYING.,"Made well, but hard to understand what the ball is saying. Not as clear sounding as the animal sound babble ball. My puppy loves the animal sound ball better."
2,Didn't go over well,"We have two dogs and a cat, all generally very playful. The ball's ""voice"" is raspy and a little too loud for any of them. None of the three will play with it and actually try to get away from it when I roll it in their direction. I don't know if ours is exceptionally sensitive, but it sometimes ""talks"" as you even just walk past it."
5,My Hedgehog LOVES this ball!,"I can hear her playing with this ball at night while I am sitting here on the computer and sometimes if I am up early enough I hear her in the morning. This is the cutest thing. I had originally bought it for my cats but they were afraid of it. So I stuck it in my Hedgies cage and she absolutely loves it! Oh and I bought one for my sisters dog, her dog plays with nothing else. My sister cracks up watching that dog roll that ball all over the place and when it talks she talks back to it. LOLBabble Ball - Small Size - 2 3/4 in. in Blue"
1,Might be nice if details mentioned it is primarily a DOG toy,"Sm. Talking BabbleThis is one of the very few times I did not read the reviews before ordering. I bought passed on the favorable 'star' rating. This item showed up when I was searching for CAT items and I thought it would be a good toy for our two cats. However, our cats are not fond of a toy that barks at them and is really for a dog/puppy. It would be nice if the list of messages spoken by this toy was listed in the description. That way if someone wants to get their cat a dog toy, all well and good but for those who prefer cat toys for cats, well they would just pass it by. It is going back tomorrow for a refund."
3,My dog loves this toy!!,"My dog loves this toy and will play with it continously. The only reason I give this 3 stars is because after only having it for a couple of times, which was carrying it around and swatting it around on the floor, it stopped working. I thought it was the batteries so went and bought some more, but once I replaced them, it still didn't work. As this is described as durable and it proved not to be it gets only 3 stars because she still loved it. I will be purchasing another one because she loved it so much and will just hope that the first one was a dud because it is so much fun watching her play with it."
3,Babble Ball Dog Toy,"My dog, a Cocker Spaniel , was intrigued by this toy at first. After a few days she just ignored it. It is well made and the ball itself is hard plastic.I ordered a large one and I imagine a dog that is very large could crack the ball with it's teeth, which would be a safety hazard."
2,my dog loved it but it broke after 2 days,"I have a 30 lb Aussie who is playful but gentle with her toys. I've never seen her so joyful as when she interacted with this toy; I think she regarded it as the best playmate she'd ever had. LOL. Sadly, the ""babble"" component of this ball quit working after just a few days. I tried replacing the batteries hoping that was the problem (battery replacement is easy to do but expensive, btw). No luck. I can hear something broken/ rattling inside the ball. Normally I would not replace a product that breaks so quickly. However, my little dog has been laying around depressed since the babbling stopped, so I'm going to order another and hope the new one lasts."
1,"Like a rock, HARD plastic-needs to be rubber","Unlike other reviewers, I love hearing my dog play with something over and over again, especially if it talks. The ""babbling"" is very cute, but the flaw with this ball is that it is hard plastic (like a cat toy) and not something many dogs would enjoy because it doesn't bounce and is like a hard rock. Now I don't know about your dogs, but none of my dogs like playing with rocks, therefore this toy is very unappealing to them (not to mention me) because I can't throw it and play with them and have it bounce. Truthfully, this ""ball"" is really stupid because it's not rubber and will not bounce and since it's so hard, I can't throw it at the risk of hitting one of the other dogs with a rock like object."
1,Talking Ball,My dogs were not interested in the ball. The voice was not clear and it was difficult to understand what it was saying. My dogs love balls but they just sniffed this ball and lefted it alone. Very disappointing based on the write-up and review.
1,Babble Ball,"I ordered this item back in July for our dog for Christmas. I never thought there might be a problem with it, so I didn't check to see if it worked. Well, Christmas Day we gave it to the dog and it didn't work. I even put new batteries in it, but it still does not work. Now of course, it is too late to return it. I won't purchase an item so far in advance anymore and I will check to make sure it works as soon as I get it."
1,Not worth it,"My playful cocker does not like it, and he is not fussy, annoying sounds. Dont waste your moneyOr time ordering"
1,recieved mine dead on arrival!,"buyers beware... i just recieved the small one today, and the batteries were dead :(."
2,Broke in one day,Our English bulldog LOVED this toy and chased it all over. It stopped making sounds within a day and he has no interest in it now.
5,Makes my dog go crazy -- in the best way!,"I thought this was the most ridiculous toy on Earth; my dog agrees. From Kongs to rawhide and squeaky toys, there is nothing that makes my dog go as nuts as this talking ball. It's borderline obnoxious (and I get annoyed easily), but when I see how incredibly happy it makes him, I completely forget about that. I would imagine this being a very temperament/breed specific toy; we also have a Bichon who couldn't care less about it (he's all about fluffy/squeaky toys), but my mutt puppy is head-over-paws. He chases it around all day long. He's extremely hyperactive and shreds stuffed animals like paper, so this is the perfect toy for him!"
4,This may be the toy for your dog ...,"We have an intelligent German Shepherd at work, that is bored sitting around all day. He's young so is into playing. He's also a 'chewer'. This toy works great with him. Keeping him interested - it is SO funny, as he 'talks' to it, and nudges it around with his nose to make it talk. So far he hasn't chewed into it. Though we watch him. It doesn't bounce, so keeping his attention with it that way doesn't work too well. But he certainly prefers it over other 'toys' and certainly better than toys he can chew through in the first 15 minutes. Certainly a toy to consider if you need a way to keep your dog alert and play by himself. Like all things that make noise - be prepared for unexpected voices when your pet starts playing behind you, and so forth."
2,"Dogs didn't love, hard plastic",Our 4 dogs didn't seem to enjoy it any more than any other ball... The larger dog (Standard poodle) wouldn't activate the voices with the smaller ball when in teeth. Needs skin/tongue contact?
3,Pros Cons,"Our 85 lb dog really enjoyed this toy for as long as it lasted. He played socker with it all over the house. It babbled and fussed, and he loved it. The down side is it lasted only two days before he broke it apart. The paper label on the toy says it is NOT a chew toy. But it's a rolling dog toy for Pete's sake, and most dogs like ours are going to put their teeth on it! It is hard plastic, but it just couldn't hold up. His tooth marks obliterated the screw plate over the battery to the point where we could never have changed the battery after the first day. The second day it broke open along its seam, exposing all the wiring and metal parts. Lots of fun for a very short time."
3,After awhile I begin to Babble,Babble is very entertaining but after constantly ending up under furniture I became less amused. It needs a shut off button and so does my dog.
2,Too Small,"Last year, I bought the ""small"" version of this for my puppy. He LOVED it, but he can now fit the small into his mouth. I didn't want to risk the chance of it being lodged, so I recently purchased the ""medium"" size. It ended up being smaller than the ""small."" I'm sending this back and ordering the large, hoping it'll be larger."
3,More fun for me than the dog!,If the dog or cat happens to move the ball they pay attention to it - otherwise - it sits. I have heard friends say their pets can't leave it alone.
2,Too hard,"I, or my dog, do not like this toy. It is too hard for the dog to play with. It was wasted money for me."
5,My dog loves it,This is a mixed review. My dog loves it so I gave it 5 stars. It drives us crazy. She makes that thing talk non-stop until we finally can't take it anymore and take it away for a while.
3,MOVIN'?,"To me, this one seems to be Joe Ligon and Clouds going through the motions. It don't exactly move me. C'mon fellas. Let's Have Church!"
5,Sweet Inventive Fairy Tale,"This book is a small, beautiful treat. Only 140 pages, Lowry's ""Gossamer"" is about a young creature called ""Littlest"" who is learning how to bestow dreams on humans like the rest of her kind. She is assigned to an older woman who lives in a small house alone with her dog. The woman is lonely, and a young boy comes into her life, changing the life of Littlest and the woman.The story is simple, sweet and incredibly touching. It would be the perfect book to read aloud to children before bed. It is a new take on dreaming and one that is quite beautiful and fun to read. I read it in a little over an hour and I think it is definitely worth remembering and recommending to others!"
3,Gossamer Review,"I generally liked this novel concerning dreams and nightmares, though it is not as specific as some of Lowry's other novels. I liked that it is mildly in-depth so it can be used as a teaching tool for the younger grades. I didn't like how it was somewhat unsuspenseful. It didn't keep me wanting to read more when I put it down."
1,it was HORRIBLE!!!,"i downloaded this on my kindle, and i am sorry i did. uselly lowery's book are great. i loved 'the giver' but this book was so hard to get through. i had to make my kindle read it to me! i mean why does john have to be mean to the dog? and why do the nightmare thingys have to be in the shape of horses? i love horses, but now when ever i see one i think of nightmares. so to cut to the chase you would be out of your mind to buy this book!"
5,short and sweet,"although i read this book in a day, i found it to be a very moving and excellent book. my daughter is a huge fan of louis lowry and the giver is her favorite book. but i think gossamer far exceeds the giver in excellence. it is a very enjoyable book with a message."
4,Gossamer,I enjoyed this book. It has all the magic and mystery that appeals to young readers (and older readers). But this book definitely has some darker themes too. The book goes into some detail of the abusive past of the little boy...which is heartbreaking. However in the end... good triumphs evil. As it should be!
2,couldn't finish,"This story is a bit too ""fairies and fantasy"" for my tastes. I suppose this would be fine for a 4th grader, but as an adult who has enjoyed Lowry's many short, lower level reading books, I couldn't finish this one. It was just a bit too demanding when it comes to ""suspension of disbelief."""
4,GOSSAMER,"Like gossamer (or a spider web), this book is lightweight, particularly in comparison to Lowry's other works. It is a quick read, not too deep, and probably not going to be a kids' classic, unlike Lowry's THE GIVER or NUMBER THE STARS.However, like gossamer, it also shows enormous strength and craftsmanship. Though not her best work, Lowry clearly knows how to tell a story and lace it with some beautiful prose. The creativity is apparent, but that still takes a backseat to the most note-worthy aspect of this book: GOSSAMER is an excellent tool for teachers to use for classroom lessons in writing. When Littlest learns of the importance and develops the quality of her delicate touch of objects, Lowry give language arts teachers an incredibly valuable lessons in writing for the senses and the poetic nature of language overall. If for no other reason than that, teachers should introduce this book to their students. I will."
5,Another Masterpiece,"This is another well-written book by Lois Lowry. Her book reads like a kid is telling it, with a child's innocence. Although well-written, I do not think that it was particularly interesting for many people who are fourteen or older. Considering that books should be graded as a whole and not just by my age, I still give this book five stars. For anyone, though, this book is interesting and thought-provoking."
4,No LYRICS,"I thought this CD would come with lyrics but apparently it doesnt...... Still, I love the music. I'm simply disappointed about not having lyrics booklet included in the CD."
5,"""God That's Good!""","this by far, is still one of the best musicals by Stephen Sondheim ever! It is smart and witty and very dark....Fantastic!"
5,Sondheim's Greatest Work Ever,"There is no other way to describe this work. This is simply Sondheim's greatest production ever. Sweeny Todd is a brilliant musical dealing with the murderous Sweeny Todd of 19th Century England.Be warned, though, this musical is NOT for the feint of heart. The musical deals with a vengeful barber who slits his customers throats and has his companion, Mrs. Lovett, bake them into meat pies, which she sells to unwitting customers. The tale is a sad, emotional one, brilliantly communicated through wonderful music and fantastic singing. Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury star the show with supporting players Victor Garber as Anthony and Edmund Lyndeck as the Judge. All are formidable singers.There is no other way to put it. If you like the grim, satirical, and sheer brilliant, you must own this album."
4,Ample informations that I'd done a project by one day!,Its has plenty of informations that are hard to find about Shakespeare and its pretty good book too but kinda complex of vocabularies to understand. Its help me instantly on my project. I'm average student and that book just gave me everythin what i need to know for project well I just wanna thank that author for helps
2,Cheap,"What can I say, you get what you pay for. It's attractive furniture but it's flimsy and the shelves sag if you put anything too heavy on it, like a 15 inch wide flat screen TV (weighs about 7 pounds). The good thing about it was that it's lightweight so it was easy for me to carry up 3 flights of stairs into my apartment."
1,Not quite a deal,It appears as though I'm not the only one who received this shelf damaged.The only good thing about this shelf is that it gives me a template for building a real one out of solid wood.I'd tend to agree with another poster who said that building materials should be clearly listed on the main page for this (and every other item).
2,don't put anything heavy on this!,"Well, I bought this w/o reading the other reviews, and I should have. I have now learned to read reviews before purchasing. This is the only time I've ever been a little disappointed by my Amazon purchase, but I am not wholly unsatisfied. My hubby needed some more ""counter space"" in our bedroom for his stuff, so I bought this shelf thinking it would go well w/ the existing decor and do the trick - and it does! just not for books & binders of reference materials, the shelves bow in the middle b/c they are too thin. Good thing it is meant to lean against the wall, otherwise I'd be afraid for it to snap in half and topple over. I should have spent a little more $$ and gotten something higher quality. It looks ok though as long as you don't put anything heavy on it :)"
4,great shelf,"Nice shelf, easy to put together and pretty sturdy. I would not put a lot of heavy books or items on it, but it works well for medium or light items. You can put heavy items on it if you put them to the sides of the shelf but it will bow with too much weight in the middle of each shelf. It is solid wood and stands alone fine. If you have small children be sure to secure it to the wall for their safety since it can be pulled over if they try to climb it. I would buy it again."
1,Awful Product - Very cheap: Don't use amazon for furniture,This product is terrible. One of the bolts for assembling it didn't fit into the hole for it. The meant we couldn't install one of the shelves. After assembling you're afraid to store anything on the shelves because it's so weak. Some of the shelves were actually bent too. There were also marks on it. It wasn't even worth the 25 bucks I paid for it and if I had kept the box I would have returned it in a heartbeat.Sadly I will never buy furniture from Amazon again.
5,it was good..,i thought that this will be a really good one but .. some of them has mixing problem.. i would say..bad mixing.. overall good.. as i love trance..it gave me actually..one of my favourite song..i will give it a five star..worth to have..
4,great buy,"I first saw him live at a club, this Miami dj has been around all over south florida. I loved his stuff live and they were promoting his new album Nu Trance, which is really good. Trance Music is getting real old, but this has good fast beats, with energetic flavor. The music on this album is what you hear in all the clubs on Miami Beach, Its GOOD Trance. Oakenfold is too comercialized, go with something new, something you have not heard, Armand."
5,Don't miss it!,This book is invaluable for study of the history of the American automobile. It is the only book I have found that lists and describes all manufacturers on the American scene from the 1890's to 1970.
1,For absolute beginners only.,"Unless you're a complete beginner to web graphics or your goalis to make cookie-cutter websites, don't botherwith this book. For Photoshop tips and tricks, I recommendthe Photoshop Wow! Book; for ideas on how to make your websitesmore interesting, pick up Creating Killer Websites. Basically,Creating Great Web Graphics shows you how to make buttons andballs. (Yawn.)"
5,"IMHO, a treasure","OK, I'll admit it: I'm an untrained novice looking for guidance, particularly from non-judgemental sources. I found it engaging, helpful, almost inspirational. It was well woth the money and will pay for itself. But what do I know, I'm just a novice yearning to learn. I know art when I see it and this is it"
4,This book is for some people that want to add flair to their,This book is for some people that want to add flair to their little web pages. Actually this book is written for people that pirated Adobe Photoshop. Because people that purchase Corel Photopaint or Adobe Photoshop are professionals and they would be beyond this book. So if you piarted photoshop then this book could make your website pretty cool
3,Beginners only!,"An absolute beginners book. Unfortunatly I am not. Contains basic information on creating buttons, textures, etc and cleaning up scans. Gives step by step instructions for Photoshop as well as Photopaint. Too bad the pages were wasted for the photopaint instructions. If you have the slightest idea about graphics design you may want to look elsewhere"
4,Good Romp!,"This book is oine of many that came out in the 70's in response to the popularity of the Lancer/Ace editions of Robert E. Howard's Conan stories (with edits and additions by DeCamp and Co.). For the most part, Fox's character is a pretty standard Clonan-type. Hulking barbarian swordsman. Yet, this character is also a Warlock. And even though he actually doesn't do anything magical, just knowing that he can sets him slightly apart, and makes him somewhat unique. I would say that Kyrik probably shares more in common with Karl wagner's Kane, but is much less dark.The book is a very slim, and thus a very quick read. From a literary point of view, it's nothing of note. But then, that's not what we read these books for, is it?"
5,nice gasket set Brand New,Nice clean and good pack I will buy more if I need it high recomend received it in time.hope buy from you again
4,Good,Although I didn't find this book of use in my class I was happy to see it arrive on time and in excellent condition.
4,"Not for everyone, but very interesting...","This tea is exclusively dried lime peels, so it's an unusal flavor. It's not a fresh lime juice-y flavor, but a somewhat bitter & concentrated taste. It is not terribly tart; I only add a little honey. There is a bitterness to it, though - think of the pungent, bitter flavor of any citrus zest. It will certainly not be a tea for everyone, but I could see myself acquiring a taste for it (I look forward to trying it iced!). It's definitely an intriguing addition to my tea repertoire, if nothing else. If you're not sure you want to purchase a whole box, try a Numi sampler - it includes two bags of each flavor, including Desert Lime."
3,Not enough material for a book,"The author makes a few good points early in the book, like: develop a knowledge-sharing culture before expecting the technology to work, emphasize flat hierarchies over deep hierarchies, and demonstrate management commitment by having them use and lead the knowledge-sharing systems themselves. However, there's not enough substance here for the author to fill a book. Some later chapters are useful, but typically the main points are repeated and elaborated with a lot of filler."
3,"Good material on culture change required, but specifics on tools used are very dated","Lots of good material on how your company will have to change to truly embrace a transition to a knowledge based enterprise. Some of the material in the last few chapters seemed a little weak though.Most of the specifics of the tools the author references seem extremely dated, especially for a book copywrited in 2004? Continual references to 'one day when wireless is popular', 28.8k modems, etc. Just seemed weird for a book that's only 5 years old. There have been numerous advances in tools that can be used for meeting the ends of what the book covers: wiki & other web based collaboration tools, etc.Bottom line: You'll get a sense of the magnitude of change required to implement a knowledge based culture, but look elsewhere for examples of the communication systems used to do so."
2,Weak,"I ordered the more expensive, and the cheaper tongue cleaners from this same seller. Both are exactly the same. Just buy the pack of 5 rather than these. I don't get it. I've used tongue cleaners my whole life. These are the flimsiest ones I have come across. Pretty disappointed to be honest. I'd rather pay more for a quality product."
3,Spode that is made in China has Inferior QUALITY!,Although Amazon shipped quickly and has great prices - this piece of Spode does NOT have the same quality of my other Spode Christmas Tree pieces that were MADE IN ENGLAND. Buyer beware and stress to SPODE to up their quality control and switch ALL manufacturing back to England!
5,Great addition to my collection.,"I just received this. It arrived in perfect condition, well-packaged. I was concerned after reading some reviews so I checked both pieces carefully. The gravy boat and plate are larger than I expected, larger than a typical set. Well worth the price."
5,Creme de la creme,"Artie Shaw was argaubly the most intelligent band leader this side of Paul Weston. He is best known for his big swing band work of the 40's. Shaw played a meaner clarinet than Benny Goodman, in this writer's opinion, which got good airing while fronting a large group of musicians. But Shaw's most intimate and creative recordings came during these chamber music-like outings with five or six musicians. Some of these recordings feature a harpsichord, of all things, which bold insertion into a jazz group works just great. Shaw was like Arturo Toscanini, in that he could hear the smallest deviation from a true note within the living context of the music, and he never let one get into the final product. If you ever wondered what ""swing"" means, listen to these wonderful cuts."
5,Chuckle till you choke,"I've heard just about everyone on both sides of the Atlantic perform Wodehouse at one time or another, including on stage and in film. Most of the audiobooks seem to have been done by Martin Jarvis and Jonathan Cecil, both very talented. But I'm here to tell you that NOBODY does Bertie Wooster as well as Charlton Griffin. You will be rolling on the floor listening to this one. His tone of voice and the voices he gives all the other characters are just as zany and eccentric as the looney world they live in. If you're a lover of Wodehouse, add this to your collection. If you're looking for an introduction to this hilarious series, this is the place to begin. PLEASE let Mr. Griffin do more of these!!!!"
5,Buy this CD!,"After all these years, this CD still holds up and brings back lots of memories! The first 6 tracks are clearly the best, but I give this CD my highest rating of being a ""play through"" CD. I can put it on and forget it. No need to skip anything!"
5,memories,"i love this c.d., it brings back some fond memories , when you didn't have a care in the world!!! it got passed around between friends and family."
1,yet another cheesy greatest hits album,"The Guess Who already has six other ""best of"" or ""greatest hits"" albums. I mean they rock, hard, but come on... you can't buy this cd and call yourself a fan. You just can't, man."
5,Awesom.,It is awesome. definitely for the more veteran Role Playing person. we just adapted rules from a different RP system.
4,Perfect for Road Trips,"I recently downloaded this book to my Kindle during a road trip. Asking and answering these questions made the time fly! The questions cover a variety of topics, encourage revealing answers, and help spark other conversations. I suppose you could come up with your own questions with some forethought, creativity, and no inhibition, but having this list gives you a quick selection and some off the wall questions. It's especially fun for a road trip or traveling with friends or your significant other.I rated it at 4-stars because the Kindle edition is expensive- $9.99 is a lot for an electronic list of questions, and there were some minor formatting errors (Example: many questions started with ""It"" instead of ""If"" or weren't spaced evenly). There are about 10 questions on the free sample download, but after we went through those I sucked it up and paid for the book for the instantaneous download and entertainment value."
4,Self-analysis,"This book was so thought provoking. I just bought it today, and I have already read throught all of it. It makes you think so deeply. I sometimes doubted my own beliefes. You end up analizing yourself so much, you find out who you are. It is a sort of self-help book. Not only did I ask my family some questions while I was reading it, but I called my best friend and asked her a few. I will be taking this to school with me on Monday. I am really interested to know the reactions people will have to this. I recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested."
2,Adults,I read a couple of reviews that said it was great for your family and made the purchase. Did not realize that quite a few questions were sex related; not the sort of things I want to talk about with my kids! Geez.
2,Questions are too political for what I needed,I wanted to use this book in a supervisor position to help my staff get to know each other and have fun. We used the 1st edition and everyone really liked it. This one fell short in my opinon.
4,IF...,"Well, IF you're one of those people who likes to question everything (like me) then this book is FOR you. It's an interesting game to play alone or with friends, and makes you question your own morale and ideals. It's great. A+ and INTERESTING to boot."
4,Pioneer work linking economics and physics,I read the whole book. The author did a pioneer work in using physics principle to explain social and economical phenomenon. The author also demonstrated his deep concern about the environmental effect of economic development.
3,"fairly well, but not quite","Winter Rain and Too Many Secrets are definately some of my favorites, but the majority of the tracks seem to lack a real punch to it. If you are into really fast paced techno, this may not be the cd for you, but is good nonetheless."
5,Great for old school true trance,"If you want some true trance, with keyboards and attention to detail, this is a great cd. I'm sure everyone knows winter rain and some of the big club songs, but I love some of the less known songs. I lost this cd years ago and glad I found it again...but ready for a comeback!!"
3,"Charming, relaxing - yet still lacking.......","303infinity has a fairly relaxing sound, it is a nice CD to put on for a chill out mood with a subtle energy edge. It will not put you to sleep, and at the same time it will not pump you up too much. I would say it is dreamy, wandering and melodic. My favorite song by far is Winter Rain. Winter Rain is the signature song of 303 infinity, it is really good and i could listen to it over and over. Too Many Secrets is also a nice song, but Winter Rain remains a favorite. This CD is a good one to have, but after time everything seems to kind of blend together, 303 is lacking variety in their songs. They all have the dreamy wandering flow to them - which is very good if that is what you are into. I personally need a little more."
1,You couldn't go more wrong...,"purchasing a book on Michigan wildflowers. There are numerous inaccuracies throughout the book, and the information is relatively unhelpful. Before purchasing this book, keep in mind this book is part of a ""series""; Mr. Tekiela has a book on ""Ohio Wildflowers"" coming out within a year of this one! I doubt the author has spent time in Michigan looking for these plants, and I'm sure none of the photos are from the state either. This is a money-making deal at best. Purchase any other book on the state's wildflowers and you'll have spent your money in a more satisfying way."
4,Great photographs and easy to use.,"I am an herbalist and needed a good reference guide to make sure that I was finding the correct species of wild flowers for my studies. This book is easy to use, concise, and well photographed. I like how it includes photos of the leaves, fruit, and flowers of the plants. I also like the discussions of where they grow as well as what kind of terraine they prefer."
3,Nice guide for the amateur watcher... though rather incomplete,"Nice guide with clear pictures and relevant identification features. However, it is rather incomplete. My family and I went out to Burchfield Park in Holt, MI last weekend and we could not identify 3 out fo 10 species of plants with wildflowers we came across. These 3 species had small flowers and (maybe because of that) were clearly not in the book."
5,Great deal for the money,"Did the job and was very inexpensive. It has a fairly small profile and got easily attached to the ceiling. It would be nice to have some cable management, but for the money, I wouldn't expect anything else."
4,High-Quality Alternative,"I just received this ceiling plate last week and installed it over the weekend. It is very solid (cast aluminum, not iron) and mounted easily. I would have paid a few bucks more and rated it 5 stars if it came with mounting hardware (screws, anchors, etc), especially if they were also black. The 4 mounting holes are quite large and require using a couple of washers unless you're using humongous lag screws to mount it."
1,Made In China,"Chief website says ""Chief products are designed and manufactured at the corporate headquarters, located in Savage, Minnesota."" I went with Chief because of this statement. I got it today and box clearly says ""made in China"" I try to buy made in USA things whenever possible and am very disappointed that this isn't. I feel deceived. I'm returning to find one that is made in America. I got an offer from beamupusa to drill holes to fit my projector and their products say they are so I'll probably go that route.It would be nice if Amazon put in country of origin for every product. It should say where assembled and where manufactured."
5,Back to the Glory Days!,"I just picked up this outstanding book. It brought back lots of fond memories from my old town. As a retiree, it made me realize how much I miss home. Job well done!!!"
5,A Fantastic Look at Chicago's Business District,"This is truly an enjoyable book with a good collection of old and new photographs that documents the Loop area. This is a ""must-have"" book for every library. Also, accompanying the photographs is a great collection of interesting text, many with little know facts about the business district. I lived in Chicago once and I can't wait to visit it again with my book."
3,Not what I expected,"This is small format book! Simply put, this is not a then and now picture book considering that photos were taken at various distances from different angles. For those who love Chicago, an outstanding book is ""Chicago at the Turn of the Century in Photographs"", A large format book with great clear photos!"
2,Insipid book,Sort of insipid book. Failed to give any significant insight into Russell's personal life. Not enough coherence in the narrative.
5,More Olivia for the Holidays,My granddaughter is crazy about Olivia. Having a holiday specific video for her to watch during this time of year has been terrific. She requests it over and over again!
4,Geared more towards parents than teens,"My son saw my copy of ""Yes, Your Teen is Crazy"" (which was an excellent book by the same author.) I thought this book would be geared more towards teens--as I planned on giving it to my son to read--to understand why parents act the way they do. However, it was not written for a teenager. It was very similar to the ""...Teen is Crazy"" book."
5,"Indeed, a teen survival guide!","My fear was that my daughter would not be into this book, because important books such as this are not easy or exciting to read. My daughter picked it up from among many books I got for me and her and kept on reading all the interesting topics (at least for her) and kept it around to read more. It is fascinating to see her not glued to the computer but reading this book on and off and keeping it next to her bed. Now my baby, I mean my daughter actually gives advices to her friends using tips from this book.Other than the simple and likable way of discussing sensitive topics; Dr. Bradley redeems parents' dignity in their kids' eyes and explain parents' points of view to teens without lecturing them. This book is one of a kind that doesn't focus on preaching and lecturing teens, but addresses their developing minds from their perspective and helps restore the connection between teens and parents. Dr. Bradley is a saint, at least in my eyes!"
3,Bought this for my son,"I bought this book for my son, I saw it when I purchased ""Yes, Your Teen Is Crazy! Loving Your Kid Without Losing Your Mind"" for myself. I couldn't get my son to read it though, but from my brief review of the book when I received it, it look like it would be humorous and an interesting read."
2,"A Re-Issue of ""Yes, Your Teen is Crazy""","I LOVED ""Yes, Your Teen is Crazy"" and was looking forward to ""... parents are crazy"" to be a good tool for our kids to read. It is a TON of information - too much - or it's just presented wrong.I would just recommend having everyone read ""your teen is crazy"" ... because that book does a good job of explaining the perspective of both teen and parent."
4,Frank Parenting Talk,"I'm still reading the book, & it is helping me to remember my teenage years. I believe that it will help be a better parent to my children."
5,Amazing book!,"I would recommend this to anyone who has teenagers. Adolescence is such a tough time and this book really gets to the bottom of all adolescent feelings in a friendly and down to earth, helpful way. I'm reading it along with my son now (I read it myself first though) - and I will also recommend it to my students' parents on parent-teacher night! The other book, Yes, Your Teenagers Are Crazy is even more awesome!!"
2,Teenage review?,Lots of parents have chimed in. Were are the teenage reviews? How do the kids really feel about this book?
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I GAVE THIS TO MY SOON TO BE 13 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER BECAUSE OF OUR REALTIONSHIP AT THIS POINT. SEEMS LIKE SHE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHY I DO WHAT I DO SO I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WOULD HELP HER. I ALSO ORDERED ME SOME BOOKS TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE DOES AT TIMES. SO FAR SHE IS IN CHAPTER 3 AND REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN READING MORE. THIS BOOK HAS TALKED ABOUT BEING GAY SO SHE WONDERS WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH YOUR PARENTS? THE MAIN ISSUE MY DAUGHTER AND I HAVE IS THAT WE TEND TO YELL AT EACH OTHER TOO MUCH, I JUST WANTED SOME WAY OF FINDING PEACE IN OUR HOME. AFTER BEING IN COUNSELING FOR A YEAR AND NOT SEEMING TO WORK, I RESORTED TO SELF HELP BOOKS. SO FAR THE BEST BOOK I HAVE FOUND TO HELP PARENTS UDNERSTAND THEIR TEEN IS ""POISTIVE DISCIPLINE"". STILL LOOKING FOR THAT BOOK TO HELP MY TEEN DAUGTHER DEAL WITH HER MOTHER WITHOUT YELLING OR HITTING."
2,"Cute, but disappointing","Definitely not in the eerie category, they tended to all be romantic in nature, and most were very similar ""reincarnated or look-alike meets ghost that wants to talk or have sex""."
3,An uneven collection but overall fun,"Few of the stories produce authentic chills - they tend to be more romantic than eerie(the book's common theme is the intervention of a ghost in the love lives of the living) - but some deliver, most notably M. Christian's perversely erotic ""Echoes"" and J. Beazley's ""The Thing at the Botton of the Bed."" Other stories have nice touches of humor, such as R. Neu's ""Remembrance of Tom Perdue"". In the main, however, the stories telegraph their ""shocks"" or ""surprises"" on the first page, and whiffs of political correctness don't help either. More astute editing would have helped. Overall, though, this is an enjoyable enough collection for the not-too-discerning fan of ghost stories."
4,Wear them every day,"I wear these earrings almost every day. When I received them they were too wide apart at the top, so I bent them a little and they fit much better. Very elegant looking."
3,Not-Quite-Perfect Fit,"I had these earrings on my wish list and received them as a gift. They are light-weight and comfortable, but I was disappointed to find that the front of the hoop tends to tilt forward, exposing the hinge and part of the post. The post is fairly long, 11 mm from the hinge to the catch, compared with 8 mm on another pair of hoops that I like better. These earrings might be better for someone with thick earlobes."
1,Lost Earring Replaced by Amazon,"These were nice earings, which I received as a gift off my wish list. But after I wore them about 3 or 4 times, one of them fell out and is now lost. The post does not stay in place very well. I am frustrated because I put these on my wish list because they are advertised as having an ""innovative clasp"" which avoids lost earings. But they did not work well for me.By the way, after I first wrote this review, I called Amazon to complain. They sent me another pair right away at no charge. This suggests to me that others have complained in the past. I appreciate that they were so responive."
2,Not So Perfect,"Upon receipt, I noticed one earring had residue on it as if a label had been removed. These earrings are nice, but rather thin in weight and certainly NOT a perfect fit. I am not confident about the clasp which is rather thin. As another reviewer mentioned, the earrings sit on the ear leaving the post somewhat visible so these will be returned."
1,"Elegant, but...",I looked forward to receiving these earrings in the post and wasn't disappointed until I tried them on! They never stayed in place at all they kept tilting forward exposing the post and hinge.
4,it was a good buy,"okay,so i was buying this as a compliment to a similar benchmade knife i already own, they're about the same, actually almost identical. just got this thing and it came out of the box sharp as h*ll. preformed a few tests and it cuts nice, and the serrate is standard for a blade this size. my only complaint is that this thing is ridiculously stiff, now in the locked position thats good but opening this suckers a pain. I'm gonna have to oil it and maybe even loosen some of the screws a tad to get it where i like. the clip is tight too, but no problem there. also the blade is a bit smaller from back to edge then the pic really show, but once again, not really a problem. overall i like it, but seeing as i didn't buy one for my self i may have to put in a second order."
2,Butterfly night light,This light looks better on the webpage then it does in my mother in law's house.
1,Never even received item.,This item never shipped and I was unable to contact the company. Horrible experience.
2,Out-in Techniques Usually don't work,"I was attracted to the book from his title and by the high marks it had from previous reviews but after reading it I found that most topics are about techniques and do not try to get to the problem of low self-esteem with an In-Out method, instead it's mearly ways to imagine your problem from different angles using pure imagination. the author could have summarized the book in 31 pages about the techniques which are useful to people who have the inside foundation of high self-esteem but are perplexed by the outside world. I would recommend the 7 habits of highly effective people as a foundation of any self improvement method."
5,search for the third,i have bothe passion moon rising and beyond the starlit frost. i have been searching for the third book in this series because i loved it so much. i hope that miss brandywine or her publishers read these reviews and the new book will be forthcoming. i am sure we all look forward to it.
1,Regret,It really was too small for an Ostrich egg. It would really be nice if you made a larger one that fit that size egg better.
5,totally try it out,i do mma and i wanted to get my wrestling game up so i purchased this book and it was great showed me a bunch of ways to help me get good quick
3,Cold War Russian Prog,"This is an intersting album that was secretly recorded in a Moscow hotel 1982-1984, in a time rock music was banned in the Soviet Union.The music is a nice blend of the prog side of mid-period Genesis and some nice flourishes of traditional Euro prog. Lots of wonderful synth's and the vocals, although sung in Russian are quite good.If you are looking for something from a part of the world we never thought had even heard of progressive rock, this proves that prog lives even where forbidden!"
4,So far so good....,"Was hesitant to buy any Coby product, but so far this has been OK. Started out as a DVD player for my kids, but got moved to the living room when my old one gave up the ghost. My only complaint and the reason for the 4 stars only is that the darned thing always defaults to subtitles on, and you need the remote to turn them off. In my house, remotes are a hard thing to find at times....3 small kids and 1 big one (me). Otherwise, I have had no problems with this $30 DVD player."
4,Coby DVD 224,It has performed real well. The operating insructions could be improved. A novice which I am has some problems understanding them
2,You be the judge...,"I bought this for Christmas and during the first movie i played it froze up in the middle of it. Eventually i got it to play and thought it was just the disc. A week or so later while watching another movie it froze up during that movie as well. Moral of the story, i have been able to get this to play a complete movie without stopping but it still freezes up at random times and will not work. I wouldn't buy this player. There are way too many others to chose from. You'd be better off giving the money away, than throwing it away."
4,Ok for Price,"Mine just died. I owned it for 1.5 years. It played VCD, burned DVD, everything I put in it. I am happy with how long it lasted it spent a lot of time in the trunk of my car being hauled into work to watch DVD, to meeting to watch dvd. Because it was so cheap and small I hauled it everywhere. I did not always let it warm up enough when I brought it in from 0 degree C and such so I am really impressed with all the use I got out of it for my $30. Much better then my parents Cyberhome, never move it and the remote died in 2 months. Luckly her Ipaq could be programed to control it."
3,Good DVD Player,"I am very satisfied with this DVD player so far. It has great picture quality. The only thing is that the sound doesn't go very high, but it can easily be remedied by turning up the volume on the television itself. Other than that, it's a good DVD player."
5,Great DVD Player!,"I purchased this DVD player for my grandfather to replace an older more complicated model. What I really enjoyed about this DVD player was that it's user friendly (Even for my 70 year old grandfather), and it only takes about 5 minutes to hook up, I have never hooked up a DVD player and the instructions made it easy to connect to any TV. Overall a great buy!"
3,nice for the price,Got this to replace my old one which was losing its optic focus. so far its pretty good. i also have 3 friends who have ones and they have made no complaints so far.the good part is definetly that its so compact and the remote is awesome being so slim. though that does make it hard to find sometimes and the layout of the buttons can be confusing
2,Quality of Player,"Initial product supplied was defective and wouldn't spin the dvd discs, then became electrically dangerousReplacement was fine, and I was not required to return defective item due to prohibitive cost of postageJust unfortunate really, wouldn't strongly recommend product"
2,Not Quite as good as stated on other reviews in my opinion.,"First problem we had was the door would not open when we pushed the button for it to open, finaly got it to open and then the remote doesn't want to function 3/4 of the time, I am actually considering returning as the quality is not any better then I could have purchased from one of the larger chain stores for the same price."
1,Bad,"My Coby Player worked for 1 month then it showed ""wrong disc"" error, with every disc. Customer service just doesnt answer. Spend your money better!!"
4,Great value and serves its purpose well.,"This little player is great. Easy to use and no problems here. The only thing I miss that my other player had is the ""counter"" display on the front. I liked knowing where I'm at when watching a show or movie. But other than that, great value!"
1,doesn't play multi-region,"Some reviewers say this plays multi-region and even explain how to make that happen. That's the only reason I bought it, to play European DVD's, but it doesn't work, so don't waste your money. It plays US DVDs fine. Now I have to buy a whole other player, should have known the price was too good to be true."
1,Didn't last a year!,"This dvd player broke after less than a year of infrequent use. I noticed that it started taking a long time to read dvds, and after a few weeks of this, it stopped working entirely.Also, the ""stand by"" feature is extremely annoying. The dvd player buttons will not respond while in stand by mode. You must either turn the unit off and on manually or turn it off of stand by using the remote."
1,NOT ZONE 2 - FALSELY ADVERTISED,I bought this item for the sole purpose of playing DVD from Europe (Zone 2). IT was not working. I called COBY. They tried to walk me thru some steps but nothing worked. They won't give me a refund. So I am left with a not so good DVD player which does not play what I was told it would. STAY AWAY FROM THE COMPANY.
1,Horrible!!,"When I got the Coby DVD Player, it seemed like a decent purchase. The player did not even turn on after I plugged it in. After trying several different outlets, I decided to return the item. Not worth it..Do not buy!!"
1,Be Advised!!! Ugly giant unremoveable red sticker on top.,"A horrible giant red and white sticker, which cannot be removed, covers almost the entire top surface of the dvd player. This sticker has debugging instructions, and instructions on how to return the player. Unfortunately, it can't be removed, and it looks horrible. The dvd player looks good in the picture, but what you see in the picture is not what you get."
1,Terrible Customer Service From COBY,"The little player works fine, until the remote breaks. Then you lose your ability to fast forward, rewind and skip. (Most functions are in the remote. The player only has three buttons.) Two different $10 Wal-Mart ""Universal remotes"" (in 2008/2009) did NOT offer COBY codes. I failed to notice the fine print. So I wasted $20 that way. I finally telephoned COBY. They finally took my order for a new remote. I sent them $6. TWELVE WEEKS LATER it arrives! THREE MONTHS to ship a remote?!? (I had to call them THREE times. I was often put on hold for a long time - always given excuses about the slow shipping.) Finally, it eventually arrived. It was the WRONG remote. I called to inform them. They said they'd send a replacement. They never have. So, for poor design (putting ""ALL"" the functions into the remote) and for terrible customer service and shipping service, I give them ONE star. But the little CD player was purchased for $30 and played perfectly for over four years."
1,Problems from the start,"I bought this item and immediatly had problems with it skipping. Within a month it was completely useless, always saying ""Wrong Disc"" and not returning to the main menu and freezing up after the movie. I have only had it for 45 days and it will not play any DVD's. I would not recommend anyone buy this player."
1,piece of junk!,"i knew going in that this wouldn't be anywhere near to top of the line, but even knowing that it fell way below my expectations. it didn't recognize a single dvd i tried to play and whenever you inserted a disc into the drive it sounded like it was gearing up for take-off. do yourself a favor and pass on this piece of junk."
3,Great for a year of 8 disks or so...,Worked great for a year or so. Only used it in my motorhome maybe 8 - 10 times. It will no longer recognize a disk... Now to find another brand of small DVD player...
2,Short lifespan!,"We got this cute little thing for Xmas and it quit working somewhere in May/June. So six months tops was its lifespan... it was only $30, I was curious to see if it would make it a year... nope."
1,"Amazon GOOD, Coby DVD-224 BAD","I'm on my second Coby unit. On the first one, the dvd tray would not open. Talked to Coby's tech support & they walked me through a reset procedure. No dice. Amazon was great, had a new unit out to me immediately & return was easy. Well, the second unit worked fine for about 2 weeks. Now the disc loads, but the unit never gets past ""LOADING...."" on the screen. I tried discs we have previously viewed on the unit, but no. I hope Amazon is as good with replacement of a DIFFERENT make & model. No more Coby for me!"
1,Not worth,"This player worked for 2 months. Then all of sudden it started failing with ""no disk"" message. Please do not go for cheap players."
3,COBY DVD player - seems small and ok,"It is a compact unit and seems to work finePros: Small, light weight, nice remote, easy to setup.Commercial DVDs seem to play ok.Cons: Some DVD's are not played well, a private DVD made by aschool (educational DVD) could not be played - some sections would not play."
2,It Broke!,Do not buy this product. The DVD player stoped working after one month. It is cheap so you get what you buy! I would not do it again!
1,GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,LIKE ALL COBY PRODUCTS THIS IS CHEAPLY MADE. IF IT BREAKS YOU WILL PAY MORE IN SHIPPING AND AGGRAVATION THEN IT IS WORTH. I HAVE A CHEAP PANASONIC THAT IS SIX YEARS OLD AND STILL WORKS . COBY DIDN'T MAKE IT TWO MONTHS.
1,Worst remote,"The player itself is OK, I guess, because I stopped using it. The problem is with the remote. Most of the keys stopped functioning after using for less than a week."
1,Do NOT Buy DVD Player!!,"I bought this DVD player about two months ago, and it has already STOPPED working. This Coby device worked fine until about 2 or 3 weeks ago, when it just stopped turning on. I had not dropped it, or misused it in any way, it simply WOULD NOT TURN ON! If you are in the market for a new DVD player, PLEASE spend a little more money to get a better quality device. You'll be GOD you did!!"
1,"Piece of crap, stay away","When I bought from Amazon I saw bad reviews, I needed a cheap dvd player so I bought it anyway, big mistake.... I turned it on but never got the dvd tray to open, it just makes noises, but doesn't open... if you buy this you'll regret it... belive me"
4,Good DVD player,"I have had my DVD player for about 2 months now and it works fine, it's easy to use, one of the things I like about it is, it has words in english and not just symbols on the player itself so you can hit the buttons and know what it is instead of guessing what the symbols might mean, my daughter thinks the DVD tray seems flimsy but as long as your careful with it I think it will last a while, and it's a great price."
1,Busted,Unfortunately this DVD player was broken upon arrival. Doesn't speak well for quality or quality control.....Its plastic too....
3,great,Had no problem shipping to an APO. Shipping time was fast. item received in execellent condition
1,Unbelievable!!,"This DVD player comes with a giant red and balck 12 x 12 inch non-removable sticker on top of it!! It will not come off.I would never display this abnoxious item anywhere in my house. Upon calling the company's customer service line, they said, it is there as a troubleshooting guide, and had a 'who cares' kind of attitude.Ther are so many DVD players out there. Don't get this one, unless appearance does not matter."
1,Don't buy this DVD,"This is the second unit we bought from this manufacturer, and both only lasted a few months. We bought it to watch movies from Europe, and we thought that the DVD player had a reasonable price. But, after having got two, and having to buy a third one now, it turns out that it will become more expensive than having bought a more expensive one from the beginning. Don't buy it if you want to save some money and spare the hussle of having to get a new one every few months."
2,Mine won't play all discs,"I bought this after reading reviews saying it would play dvds from both inside and outside the USA. I used to have a inexpensive Cyberhome DVD player that could handle both but unfortunately this one won't. I've tried to find out how to unlock it for multi region use but none of the methods I've found work. I think they are out of date. Also it seems very noisy when it's spinning. I guess you get what you pay for and I should pay closer attention to the specifications. Having looked back at them now it doesn't actually say it is multi region. Oh well lesson learnt, I hope!!"
1,Remote doesn't fast farward,The remote doesn't fast farward. We tried to contact the support to report this problem. They said they would send us a new remote. We never received it. After a few weeks we tried to contact the support again and this time they did not even respond.I gave up on this. I will never ever buy a COBY product again.
1,dont buy this,you get what you pay for. this is junk. we just wanted a small dvd player and this looked like the right size. it only works with some of our netflix movies makes weird noises and scratches the edge of my dvd's. spend a little more and get a better player.
4,Great for the price!,"I got this for my son's room because it is inexpensive and compact. So far, it has worked very well for him. It has had no problem playing any of the discs we have put in it. The unit is very easy to setup and use.Whatever you do, do not lose the remote! Otherwise you will not be able to perform many of the functions of the DVD player.I was hoping that this DVD player could be vertically mounted, but it cannot. The disc tray does not have the grooves to hold the disc in place when it is mounted vertically."
3,Good enough,There is no wow factor with this product but it does what it says it will. No complaints.
1,Garbage,This player is absolute garbage. It would not read half of the DVDs I tried to play on it and now won't play anything at all. Do yourself a favor and buy a name brand. It doesn't pay to go cheap.
1,Stopped working after 1 month,"First, this DVD player died after only a month. But even when I was using it, I have to say it has the worst remote control ever! You have to get it pointed at exactly the right angle, then push the buttons really hard. There is no button to just fastforward or rewind - the buttons skip by chapter. Now, if you hold down the skip chapter buttons, it will turn to ff, but choosing your speed of ff is hit or miss - a nanosecond too long, and you're back to playing. As for the 90 day warranty, you have to pay shipping to them and back - it would be more expensive than the unit itself cost."
3,DVD player,"It is fine, but I only got it to watch UK stuff. The manufacture did not make it clear that your TV has to be able to see UK too. So it is a fine DVD player but I can't use the UK setting, too bad."
1,Consistently dies in 30 days or less,I purchased this player - worked great for about 3 weeks & died - was able to get a replacement from Amazon (very quickly I might add) the replacement lasted about 30 days...not so good.
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!! WOULD NOT OPEN WHEN I FIRST REC'D IT. I GOT IT TO OPEN FINALLY - IT WORKED ABOUT A DAY THEN DIED. I CALLED THE COMPANY TO GET A REPLACEMENT & THEY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING UNLESS I PAID $14 FOR SHIPPING (THIS DVD PLAYER WAS ONLY $20 TO BEGIN WITH) I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT OR THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE!!!!!!!!!!!
2,OK for the price,I got this to replace another inexpensive coby DVD player for a workshop. This one is fair. Very slow response time. From one to two seconds to act when buttons are pushed. It came with an unsightly sticker from the manufacturer applied on the top regarding troubleshooting. Very flimsy construction on both the unit and remote. Probably won't last long.
3,"Great player, problematic remote control","This is my 2nd coby dvd player, the reason I got this new one is because the remote died on me from the old player, and without the remote, you cannot control anything from the player itself. This 224 remote has the worse design, it has many buttons that are not useful on it and is not the same as it showed on the picture. The main button like play, fast forward, rewind and pause are on the very bottom of the remote, which are way inconvenience.Tips: Fast forward and Rewind is the same button as previous and next chapter, you need to hold the button 2 to 3 seconds for it to start fast forwarding (x2, x4, x8, x16, x32), however, it is very sensitive that you always end up skipping to the next chapter.Overall, the player itself is good, but the remote control sucks!!! I like the previous model remote control better!"
4,Love it so far!!,"I agree- for the price, it can't get better. It reads every single DVD that I've put in so far, including many that were not being read by my previous player. Seems to be working fine, no issues at all, except for a slight whirring noise when it runs, doesn't bother me much..Not sure how long it will last, but would be happy if it lasts a year. At the now reduced price, I almost feel like stocking up!"
1,What a waste of money,"We bought this item on September 1st. As of mid-December, it was dead. It won't power up no matter what we try, and since it's past Amazon's return window, and Coby's crummy warranty is only 90 days, we're left with $27 we flushed down the toilet.It may be cheap, but you get what you pay for! In the past I've always gone with better brand electronics and paid more for companies with a good reputation. Since this was for an extra machine in our bedroom, I went cheap, and now I'm regretting it!Spend the extra $20-50 and get a Sony or something else."
5,Small but Powerful,"Love this little machine, small and with a PAL feature as well, I can't ask for more."
1,Remote doesn't work on opening the box,The DVD player works fine. But the remote doesn't work. Tried different batteries and same. No phone number to call to get a replacement.
1,The good news. It turns on.,I play dvd's once in a blue. I was able to play maybe a dozen dvd's and it started to skip badly until it broke completely. It turns on. That's about it.There must be better options for an inexpensive dvd player. Don't bother with this one.
4,Help! Anybody!,"So far, I've had this little chap for a few minutes, and he works fine as far as normal US DVDs. Anyone know if I can play region 2 discs? I was in Europe a few years back and bought a ton of DVDs that I can only watch on my computer. If anyone knows how to reprogram the DVD player into a region 2 player, then let me know, PLEASE! If not, oh, well. It's useful anyway."
1,Don't buy this,"It can't read the home recorded DVDs, it can only read the original DVDs. What's good is that. I bought it & threw it away, since it's too much trouble shipping it back."
1,Skip the Coby,"If you power it off from the machine it won'd turn on with the remote.If you turn it off from the remote you can't turn it on from the machine w/o powering it off.If you turn it off it won't retract the tray.You can't eject a dvd w/o turning it on.If you power it off from the machine it will forget it's video settings, such as Composite out...which may entail rewiring the setup long enough to use the menus to get back to the original settings."
2,cheap only,"the sound always has gap or silence for moment, I thout it's my DVD problem, play on mt other DVD player the disc was good.you get what you pay, 25 bucks only anyway."
4,Very Good,"Cheap and Best. Its Really Very good., Any DVD / VCD will play., and Mainly its very good for India. it will support 240V input."
2,Coby DVD-224 Compact DVD Player,"I purchased a coby compact dvd player about a month ago. As soon as I got the player, I plugged it into the outlet, and the disc tray imediately ejected then quickly retracked back to the closed position and jammed. The tray occasionally functioned correctly after playing with the machine for awhile. I returned the product a week after purchase, and recieved a full refund. I guess that old saying is true, you get what you pay for. I only paid 26 dollars for it, so I really didn't loose anything. I don't really recommend anybody buy this product, if you want quality I suggest coming off a little more dough then 26 dollars! Lol!"
2,Junk,"I have this for almost a year. It's junk. I would not buy it again. It is very selective with the discs it plays often skips. It has no digital display on the front. The buttons on the remote are set up poorly.You can turn the player off by using the remote, but you cannot turn it back on with the remote."
5,Coby DVD-224ss Compact DVD Player,I purchased the Coby DVD-224ss Compact DVD Player because some of the DVD's I purchased overseas would not play on my old Panasonic. The unit was functional right out of the box. No adjustments were needed. All the DVD's that I bought overseas are now playable. This is an excellent unit for the price.
1,"Bought 2, neither worked","Bought 2 bec of the price, neither worked. What I can say? I knew it was cheap."
1,Waste of money,"Pros: NoneCons: I bought six of these to give as presents, only two of them were still working at all after 30 days and one of them has a sticky tray. The phone number you have to call to get an authorization for warranty service goes unanswered permanently and there is no other way to proceed. This is a junk product from a junkier company, I will never buy another product from this manufacturer."
3,Good DVD player - long lasting - cheap - Remote complain,"This is my second Coby. This first one I had for 2 years and it worked too good. I got it in 2005 and we played, almost every kind of DVD, CD, MP3 etc on it. It's of good quality and sturdy.The second one I purchased recently.Only complain I have is with the remote. The remote is not the one that is shown on the picture ( I had the one shows with my previous player) . Worst part on this , no rewind and forward button !!!! .... So you have to rely on next screen, which will take you 5-8 minutes back or forward or if lucky close to where you want to go. That's really stupid!!!Rest all is good..... my previous one was lost by my mover hence purchased another one......"
4,a very cute DVD player,"I ordered this device for my younger daughter for Christmas, and I have yet to find out,(including my child), to find out if the dvd works. Also it appears to be somewhat simple to operate and the most feature I admire about this item is the size. It is very compact for a minimal of space when an individual is not solely wanting a lot of space for entertainment."
4,Good budget dvd player,"It does everything it should at a low price. It also has S-video and digital auidio coax connections. The only annoyance was the subtitles came on after 10 min into a movie and it's set to the default of off. So, we have to turn them off everytime that happens. But, once they're off they stay off until a new movie is inserted. Overall, I can live with that for the price."
4,Great Small DVD Player,This is a tiny dvd player and I took it with me to Brazil.. it was great to have it while I was there to watch DVD's. It was a little noisy but what can you expect for the price?All in all a good deal.
3,Decent product for the price,This product works fine. I use it at work in a display floor setting and the only problem I have with them is that after continuous use for an extended period of time (as I can't turn them off when I leave due to visitors) they die in a couple months.
1,Breaks fast,"This DVD worked/played nicely for 1-2 months, but broke down fast. Buyer beware. It was great in the beginning and so easy to use, but the quality must be bad, since other reviewers also mentioned that their unit broke quickly too. And, at $40 dollars, it doesn't pay to get it fixed. Also, the remote control is very cheaply made. For $40, you can find better value on Amazon or at the major retail stores."
1,This dvd player is not worth the money,"I bought this dvd player about 6 mos ago and it died. First the remote went out and you can't even manually fast forward or rewind without the remote. That was a headache all in itself having to put the dvd player on pause every time we left the room. My 7 year old sometimes like to rewind to see something again and now he frustrated that he can't do it. Now the dvd player is saying ""no disk"" when there is clearly a disk in there. I would suggest spending your hard earned money on a good dvd player."
2,Not a good idea.,"After an expensive dvd player only lasted 4 years, I thought I'd try a cheap one. In worst case, if it only lasted one year, it wouldn't be that bad. It arrived immediately, however looked nothing like the picture (it's black, not silver, with a different remote). And, after only 1 day, I had problems. It started freezing mid-way through dvd's. I've returned it. And I must say, I'd have been better off spending twice the money, just to avoid any inconveniences."
3,Not what I expected,"It didn't have manual buttons on the dvd, in case the remote failed. I should of paid more attention when I ordered it."
1,Thanks for the lousy remote.,Super stoked to have a dvd player with a remote that WON'T work. Because fixing things manually is really awesome. I don't even use this now.
1,Beware of this product.,"The tray on this unit is very shallow and it ""eats"" CD's. I had to take it apart to get the last one out and I couldn't trust to keep using it. Cheap but not good."
4,New code!,If you want to make it region free don't bother with the vol+ vol - instructions they don't work! If you got this after 2010 try this:The OSD button is replaced by the DISPLAY buttonPress MENUType 8888Press DISPLAY(a box with several messages will be displayed)Press 0 ( region free)Press OK
1,DOA,"Unit wouldn't power up after installed, found both power fuses blown.Returned for refurn.I found one Pyle and ordered it as a replacement."
1,Noisy,I had cancelled this order because I went out and bought one for a similar price. But the company sent the Coby DVD 224 player anyway and disregarded my cancellation request. So I returned the one I bought and kept the Coby. It takes forever for the disc to load and then it's motor is so noisy. This product is a piece of junk. The Coby I bought a year ago skipped too much. Be careful if you plan on buying a Coby DVD player.
1,"Wont play many DVDs, including store bought","We bought this DVD player from Amazon a few months ago because of the price, and the reviews at the time. Found that when it does function correctly it indeed does do what it is supposed to do (play DVDs).BUT ....The problem is that all too often it will not play a DVD. We're not talking just recorded DVD+R or DVD-R disks, but clean, unscratched, store bought DVDs. Needless to say it is very annoying to rent or buy a DVD, only to not be able to view it. As a work around we have had some success using the MENU button on these disks, then doing scene selection to choose scene one.We have never owned a DVD player that will not do at least its intended job. Very disappointed, and would never recommend this brand/model."
5,portable and convenient,"I received this dvd player as a free gift when I purchased a cell phone. I was skeptical at best, but have been very surprised by its performance. I keep in in my car and take it with me on overnight trips. It hooks up easily to most hotel televisions and keeps my 11-year-old son occupied. Sure, it's not the most impressive machine out there, but for under $30 I think it's a powerhouse."
3,If at first you don't succeed,"When I first received this product I was really excited. I had a stack of movies ready to go. For about a week or so everything was fine, the picture quality was fine. Then for some strange reason the DVD player kept shutting itself off and on repeatedly. Sometimes it would keep flashing and others it was every 10-15 minutes. As soon as the movie got going the player would restart thus restarting the movie. The next day when I got to work I requested a return in order to receive a new one. I was pleased with the quickness Amazon showed in getting me a new one and sending someone to pick up the old one. So far the new one is fine so hopefully in a couple of weeks it still will be."
2,"Plays ok, but noisy","I bought this DVD player at a local store. It plays fine (including CDs and DVDs full of mp3 files and pictures) but it ""chirps"" every few seconds while playing. It is a small thing, but it gets very irritating after a while. The chirp in question is not particularly loud but is VERY penetrating - somewhat like a whistle.In short, I am satisfied with the feature set and price of the player, but not too happy with the quality of the hardware."
3,"Great size, Great price, but it lasted less than a year","It played absolutely everything we put into it. Compact design, great price.It lasted just under a year though.And you can't do a whole lot without the remote. No ffwd, rwd, etc."
1,Dont buy this piece of crap!!,"I dont want to give this product even a 0 rating. i would rather give it in the -ve. I bought this DVD player couple of months back, ignoring the bad feedbacks given to this product. Result of that big mistake -- i ve to dump this product in garbage. This might have worked fine for first 5 times. thatz it. now it is giving wrong disk message to all the DVDs that i play. These DVDs work fine with my other DVD player. so please dont waste your money on this absolute piece of junk. if you feel like spending on this crap, instead, consider donating that money to charity so that atleast your hard earned money wont go to garbage !!!!"
3,Cheap and versatile player with some drawbacks.,"After going on a vcd buying spree, I was left with a stack of movies with no way to watch them. I picked up the Coby 224 and so far I am pretty happy. It plays dvds and vcds flawlessly, and unlocking the region restriction was a snap. The biggest drawback is the lack of a go-to feature. I have the terrible habit of watching movies very sporadically, and this wouldnt be that big of a deal if you could leave the movie paused for more than ten minutes without reverting back to the main menu. If those issues mean little to you, than by all means pick this up. Eve if they do, you cant go wrong for how cheap this is."
1,Failed out of Box,"This is the first purchase that I ever did over the internet failed out of box. This DVD player failed to play any DVD. I had to return it and am now awaiting the refund ""patiently"" for almost 3 weeks with no results yet. Note that I did not consider 'replacement' to be a wise move."
4,Coby DVD-224 Compact DVD Player,"Item is nice and compact, and seems to work very well so far. I wish the remote had a power on/off button on it, but even without that, I still would have given the item a five--or a four-and-a-half, except it also comes with an ugly yellow instruction sticker on the top of it that doesn't come off. Maybe the sticker could be put on the bottom? Or the instructions could be put on a card?"
1,garbage,dont waste your money. DVD player never worked only displayed no disk.Thank God I bought this from Amazon. the return was easy.
1,Think of it as a short term player,"We bought this in Dec. of 2008. When it worked it was fine. Now it's August 2009 and the unit is dead. The power won't come on. Did everything I could per the manual/customer service and there is no hope. It's dead! 8 months of use and we are out the money for this unit. I will never buy a Coby brand of anything,,,,ever,,,never again!"
2,Worked great - until it didn't,"I bought this about two years ago from amazon. It worked great for most of that time. In the last few months, however, it's been slowly dying. Every disk was skipping after a while. Reinserting would sovle the problem. That problem became more and more frequent, and now it will read no disks.I didn't mind the unit while it worked, though I had some quibbles. The remote layout is confusing, and switching menus can be excrutiatingly slow. But such things can be put up with for $28.However, I think I'll step up to a mid-range model now. It'll probably last longer and it'll be one less cheap electronic device full of heavy metals I have to recycle."
3,"Pause and ""R"" Stop work very poorly","For a very inexpensive DVD player this one is true to the quote ""You get what you pay for"", that said my grip is when you use either the Pause or R stop a DVD and after a period of time the player reverts to PLAY. Further if you go to Standby mode all R Stops or Pause is erased.Slow and Fast Forward/Reverse do work well (be sure to hold the buttons down)Audio and Video are excellent. The Remote control is small and very easy to use."
1,Stopped working after short period of time,"I purchased this item around Feb 1 from Amazon, used it a handful of times, and by June 1, it no longer worked. Specifically, the device will not open when I push the open/close button the device or on the remote, rendering it useless. While cost effective, it certainly wasn't worth it and I would not recommend it."
4,this is nice!,"I am a demanding customer and this is a great product. Small in size has all the basic functions and also plays mp3 discs, wich doesnt say on the manual. Too bad you can not remove the signal of zoom from of the screen"
1,This products sucks after some time,"i brought product from Amazon, i rarely used the player. Now am getting no disk error. Coby has such a defective product. I would advice people never buy this player."
1,Never Buy Coby DVD player,"I bought ""Coby DVD-224"" from Amazon for 30 bucks. It stopped working after 4 months. Coby Company didn't help me as it only comes with 90 day warranty. Go for CyberHome DVD player instead."
2,You get what you pay for,This unit lasted approximately 4 months before it stopped reading DVD's. I think it overheated. The circuitry in this machine is clearly crappy.
1,Won't Play DVD-R,This was the second Coby DVD-224 that I had purchased. (The first from a retail store) My first DVD-224 works fantastic and will play every type of DVD I throw at it. I gave this one to my child and ordered another. The second one came and was obviuosly not the same model. Sure it said on the box and on the unit that it was a Coby DVD-224 but the unit was different from my first one and the remote was completely different also. This second unit will only play store-bought DVD-9 media. Won't even load DVD-R media. So much for using it to watch home movies. I would have sent it back but for the $26 I spent it wasn't worth the hassle of packaging. Pretty disappointed.
4,Well worth the price,"Easy to set up and use, measuring just 9 x 10 (plus the cables protruding from the back). comes WITH the A/V cable which surprised me. **Read the other review here as to 'Region'; you'll be glad you followed his instructions!** easily packed into my carry-on bag and worked great while I made my last trip. the BAD thing is that covering the TOP of this product is a super-glued 'troubleshooting tips' guide; you will gently use your car's ice scraper to get this off but jot down its contents on the back of your manual as some items in this ugly attached notice are NOT in your manual. (Note: this is the ONLY reason it 'lost' a star in my book...the time it took to get the sticky notice removed!)"
5,EXCELLENT COMPACT,MUCH SMALLER THAN THE ONE I BOUGHT A FEW AGO. I JUST WANTED SOMETHING TO ADD TO THE TV IN THE FITNESS ROOM WHILE I TREADMILL EASY TO WORK NO PROBLEMS WITH IT VERY EASY TO GO TO SELECTIONS WERE I HAD STOPPED OFF . I AM GOING TO MOVE THIS ONE TO THE LIVING ROOM AND PUT THE BIG ONE IN THE BACK UNTIL I CAN ORDER ANOTHER ONE. SMALL ENOUGH TO ADD TO EVERY TV IN THE HOUSE.
5,nice player,Cheap but nice product. You can make it region free.Will not play DVD-RW though but otherwise gives good service.
1,coby dvd-224ss compact dvd player,"I've had three of theses players, first and last were not worth even the cheap price. The last one new out of the box didn't work. Amazon was great, they took it back and paid for the shipping."
5,So far so good!,"This dvd player was super cheap and easy to transport because it is so small. I've had it about a month and so far, no problems. I'm a happy customer!"
2,DVD Player,"For a cheap dvd player it works. Not real user friendly fast forward or rewind, but you get what you pay for. It will be fine till Blu-Rays drop another $100.00"
1,DO NOT BUY,"All negative reviews are correct. The player will make loud grinding noises and not read many DVDs. Very intermittent, it does not play all DVDs."
1,DO NOT BUY COBY PRODUCTS,"The first couple of DVD's that I tried in the DVD-224 skipped while playing, and since then nothing will play at all... it just keeps loading. I've tried several types of DVD's.Get this, not only does Coby expect me to take my time, money, and effortto send back a unit that was defective from the start, but they also require a money order of $12.00 for processing and return shipping.A $28.00 DVD player quickly becomes a $45.00 player.AVOID COBY"
2,Disappointing,I had a problem with this DVD player. I hooked it up to a TV/VCR combo.The instructions said that I might need coaxial cables but they did notimprove the situation. The picture fades in and out on all but one of myDVD's. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time or money on this one!
1,Broken already,"I purchased this DVD player only a month ago, and a week and a half ago, it stopped reading the DVDs.I would recommend spending a little more money and saving yourself the hassle."
1,Very poor performance...,"This DVD player died after two hours (one movie). It has an awful spin sound when it does work. After a short use, the screen freezes and getting your CD out of the machine after it dies it no picnic. Beware of this cheaply made, useless product."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!,This is the worst thing I every purchased.The first dvd I put in it got stuck inside. I had to pay $20 in late fees+replacement charges for the dvd. Will the COBY people refund this money??? I would give it the NEGATIVE stars if there was an option.
2,Defective tray;,"This item plays well, but has a couple problems. After only a few months of owning it, the disc tray began to malfunction. When it pulls the disc in, it does not go far enough, you have to open the door and push it just a little further in or it will spit the disc back out at you. I dealt with this for about a month, figuring it wasn't too big a deal, but now it needs assistance ejecting discs too (which requires a screw driver). Time to buy a new one. I consider this a waste of money now, and will never buy a Coby product again. In Coby's defense, I did get what I paid for. Another issue is the subtitles are always on by default. Each time I put a disc in I have to use the remote to turn them off. I have searched the manual and the menus for a way to disable this ""feature?"", and have not found a way. Another reason I will not buy another Coby product."
5,Great little Player!,Easy to use .....just follow instructions in user manual....picture quality is great! and price was excellent!!!
1,Big Fat Let Down,"I bought this Coby dvd player because it was listed as being NTSC/PAL compatible. I loved this because I buy a lot of dvds from the U.K., dvds from some of my favourite shows like The Catherine Tate Show, Footballers' Wives, Keeping Up Appearances, etc. This alleged compatibility was totally deceptive. It should have been clarified that it would be compatible with tvs that are NTSC or PAL. It is NOT compatible with dvds that are Region 2 (PAL) coded. The only way this dvd will work with a foreign dvd is if it is listed as Region O. To say I was let down or miffed by this experience, would be a bit of an understatement. I will NEVER waste my money on a Coby product ever again! I would sooner set my money aflame.If you are wanting a dvd player to play Region 2 dvds, like those from the U.K., don't waste your money on this product. Trust me, you would be wasting your money."
3,IT IS NOT WHAT YOU SEE. the remote control is complicated and difficult to use,The item (remote) is nothing like the one pictured; it is complicated and seems kinda' cheesey.I suppose time will tell if the performance is up to par...the buttons are ALL the same and are laid out in ten columns by five wide.
4,Coby DVD-224ss Compact DVD Player,"Small lightweight, easy to use (once I realized I needed to hold down the forward or backward arrow to select the 2X 4X 16X 32X speed, otherwise clicking once just jumped it to the next scene). Good deal for the money."
5,DVD Player,"I bought this DVD Player for my grandson for Christmas, he was so excited to have a DVD Player of his own, in less than 2 minutes he hooked up his player to my TV and we watched two movies, it was small and fit perfectly beside my TV, it was very easy to use and I might add my grandson Brian is 12 yrs old. He loves his DVD Player.Thank You for such a good product and for making me look like a wonderful Grandmother who knows just exactly what he wanted for Christmas......."
3,OK Player,I originally bought this DVD player because I neede one that would play DVDs I bougth from the UK. When my primary DVD player broke I used this one more often and discovered that it did not play most of my Disney DVDs and some other DVDs that I have. Since I discovered this more that 30 days after I bougth it I could not return it. If you are buying this only to play DVDs not in your region then this is a great player otherwise you should pass on it.
1,"Freezes, skips...awful.","This would be a nice little DVD/CD player if it worked. The audio sounds great to me. The video is so-so on my HDTV and overall I'd be pleased for the price but no matter what DVD I put in, it freezes and skips after about 15 minutes. Unusable. Don't bother."
1,Doesn't work!!!,We bought this DVD player ...and did not use it for a few months and then when we finally started using it ..we could just watch a couple of movies and then it went dead!When u load the disc it just says Loadng for a long time and then says No Disc!Its a waste!
1,Nice inexpensive DVD player - BUT Died in 4 months... ;(,"EDIT: it died 4 months later, the spindle motor stopped working... such a sucker I was for being CHEAP...!=======================================================================I just bought Coby DVD-224 for my bedroom, it works as expected but only with DVD-ROM and brand name DVD-R, it does not recognize DVD+R media I've tried. Of course nothing said it would recognize +R so it is not a complaint. I have rated it 5, however it's picky about media and I should give it 4-1/2. If you watch pressed (DVD-ROM) or branded -R media go for it, it does good job with nice futures for the price. Owerall I'm happy with the purchase, have it for a month now and its compact size is just what I needed. BTW, it playes MP3s nicely but it's also picky about CD-R media (burn it at slowest speed, single session, disk at once, close session!)"
1,Beware yours too may be used or refurbished!!,"I received this product packed in brand new packaging. When I opened it,guess what I found? The Lion King disc 2 in the deck! Nowhere on the box or in the add indicates this is a used or refurbished item, but one does wonder why that disc was in there?"
1,NEVER BUY A COBY ELECTRONIC,"I do think they are a terrible company that does NOT stand by their products. First off, I bought 2 items. This item and another combo TV/DVD player. NOT ONLY WERE BOTH ""Defective"" (their words), but I had to pay to ship to them and GET THIS - include a $25 money order for them to send back. Its just outrageous that they conduct business this way. NO ONE should ever buy Coby electronic products b/c companies like these do not deserve to be in existence. If you are going to sell products STAND BEHIND them. If they are defective, fix them, or replace them. Don't make the customer pay for your defective technology. SHAME ON YOU Coby Electronics!"
4,Worth the money,"For the price, this is an excellent DVD player. I subscribe to Netfilx and watch DVDs regularly, so I've already worn out two other DVD players. Only two drawbacks have come to light so far: (1) the DVD player arrived with an ""FAQ"" glued to the top of the machine, which I removed with difficulty (I'd have preferred a removable sticker); (2) occasionally, I have problems accessing Special Features (not sure if this is a problem with the machine or me)."
2,DVD Player Can Be Overly Sensitive,"For the price, this DVD Player is okay but it shuts down a lot and cannot read discs that have minimal amount of wear."
3,Making region free,This hack works for my Coby 224 purchased in 2011Press MENUType 8888Press DISPLAY(a box with several messages will be displayed)Press 0 ( region free)Press OK
1,Piece of junk with poor support,"The DVD-224 is advertised as a CD/DVD/MP3 player. Nowhere in the manual or on line do they tell you how to play MP3s. I manage to figure it out and it actually worked - twice. After less than one month the DVD-224 won't play anything. I can't get past the ""loading"" step. I did e-mail Coby through their on line customer support. No response."
1,Just not worth it,"I bought the COBY DVD-224 new for $21.20 at an after Christmas sale. Got it home plugged it in and enjoyed some DVD's. Here we are less than six months later having watched only 10-15 dvd movies and the dvd players stops working. I emailed customer servise to explain my situation only to find the company does not want to stand behind there product. In fact, they want me to send them ($31.00) for shipping, handling and exchange which is more than I paid for the original dvd player instead of an out right exchange for a new player."
3,couldn't change the charge card?,I didn't get the chance to enter the credit card I intended to use - and the site would not let me access the record in time to use the appropriate information.
3,DVD's and their Remotes,"The sound and picture quality is excellent, however the appearance is marred by a yellow and red unremovable trouble shooting guide on the top (very ugly). The remote on the other hand is a badly laid out and unreliable piece of junk that either doesn't register the command or registers it twice. What should take one press of a button to acomplish usually takes five or six."
3,Ok...,"Works well, and was bought for my daughters room. She has had a while now, and its still working, and plays all her dvds. It's ok for a cheaper dvd player."
1,Terrible Piece of Junk,This player is not worth even $5.00. The open and close drawer is loud. Brand new the player does not work correctly.Do NOT purchase.
2,Inconsistently reads discs,"At first the player would not read perfectly fine discs consistently. I kept getting ""wrong disc"" announcements. I even sent some discs back to Netflix thinking they were bad, even though they looked fine. Then it wouldn't read the replacement discs. I can trick it into reading now by ""jamming"" it with repeated forward or play commands. There are often glitches in the video transmission where you see a jumble of pixels for a nanosecond, then it resumes.I'm disappointed in this lack of reliability from a new machine. But I don't want to be without a DVD player while you repair it and send it back or having to wait after shipping it back to get another one. So I'll probably just use it until it fails completely and buy another one ... but not from you."
1,141 one star reviews for this item at ASIN B000261N6M,"See reviews for this same item at ASIN B000261N6M ""Coby DVD-224 Compact DVD Player"". The difference is in the color of the case.As of September 27, 2009, 141 reviewers rated it one star because it broke after only a few days to months of use. Some were dead on arrival."
3,Dvd-224S -new region code hack,"I recently purchased this player and was disappointed that neither of the region code hacks listed below have allowed me to change the region. This player is a coby dvd-224S and after some investigation I found a hack for another player that works with the Dvd-224S model. Here it is:1) Power up the unit with no disc inside2) Open the DVD tray3) Press '9735' on remote3) Region code screen appears, press the RIGHT arrow to reach list.4) Change the region code to desired region using UP or DOWN arrow.5) Press enter and Setup to exit"
1,Total waste of your money.,"Stay away from this product.I bought this over 8 months ago and I wish I had saved the $20 I spent on this and bought a decent multi region DVD player. I have yet to see it play any of my DVD I got from France. Also the remote is extremely annoying since you have to be close to the device and aim at it directly, and that is not easy at night when you are half sleep, and you have to walk to the device and turn it off manually."
1,Lemon,I bought this player last month. It no longer works. Symptoms: Overheating and Laser malfunction. I've read other reviews on this player and decided that COBY sells Lemons.
5,DVD Player,"The Coby DVD player has a small footprint, but does a big job. Very easy to setup and use."
1,Don't Waste Your Time - Product DOESN'T Work!!!,"I bought this player because of its apparent multi-region capability. That feature, unfortunately, is NOT working. I followed all instructions that other fellow customers provided online, tried it on 3 different TV's, all without success! What a huge waste of my time. Coby's customer service is worthless, all you get is a busy signal (I tried for several days). I'm packing it up and sending it back where it belongs."
3,"Awful quality, but cheap and plays other regions","I bought this player because I needed something that could play my region 5 DVD's. It did play the region 5 DVD's, but didn't play home-burnt ones and broke all together after 1 year (started making strange noises a couple of months before it broke). It just stopped in the middle of a new region-1 movie and started clicking. I turned it off, then tried turning it on after a few weeks, and it played half a movie (a different one) and then stopped again. When I first got it, took it out of the box and started setting up, my first thought was that this thing will not last very long - it just looked so cheap and of poor quality. A huge pro is that it is so cheap and you can buy a new one every year. However, it would be nice to pay 30 bucks and not have to throw the thing away after a year, so I'm looking into a Philips DVP 5140."
3,DVD Player,"Nice, compact unit. I had to buy a splitter of some sort in order to use it with my older TV. That was $25.00 I wasn't expecting to pay."
4,So far so good.....,"I've had the DVD player for about two months and haven't had any problems with it. So far the only thing that I don't like is that the subtitles automatically come on when you start up the movie. Besides that, I got what I paid for."
1,Case of the dying dvd players,"I started out loving this product. It was cheap and could play anything. I liked it so much I bought another.After watching about 2 dvds a week for a few months, the first one died, then the second about 3 months later The first one started freezing and failing to read pretty much anything then the other just started coming up with ""wrong disk"" on anything you stuck in it. These were two different coby models, but both were crap.Besides the early death of the players, another down side is that no universal remote seems to know who coby is, and so you are stuck with the initial remote (learning remotes also fail to control cobys).In the end, dvd players are all cheap now. Spend a little more money and get a good brand name one."
2,Zoom icon won't go away,"Warning: Do not by the Coby Mode. 224 DVD player if you want to watch anything in the Zoom mode. When you try to watch anything in other than normal zoom it puts a distracting 2,3,or4x zoom icon almost in the middle of the screen. After several phone calls and e-mails to Coby, I must assume there is no way to make this icon go away. I can't imagine why a manufacturer would design a player this way."
2,Cheap but not reliable,"We bought this largely because of the low price. It worked fine for about 2 months, but we started to notice more and more pixelization on DVD's. Some played better than others, some didn't play at all. At first we thought it was scratched/dirty/worn DVDs but it seemed to becoming more frequent over time.We ended up buying a new DVD player (Philips DVP5140) that was only a bit more expensive, and ALL of the DVDs that failed in the Coby worked perfectly in the Philips player.If money is really tight, the Coby is a short term fix for a nice low price. If you can afford the extra $30, the Philips player seems a much more stable product. Its not perfect either, but it does seem like better value for the dollar than the Coby."
4,GREAT DVD PLAYER,"PICTURE QUAILTY IS A LITTLE DARK BUT OTHER THAN THAT...THE DVD PLAYER IS GREAT! FOR 30 SHIPPED, what else can u ask for? If it breaks down...u can AFFORD to buy another one, and it if doesn't..HEY! you got your 30 dollars worth.UNLOCK THIS DVD PLAYER TO PLAY ALL REGION DVDs!!!! DOES NO HARM TO THE DVD PLAYER! MAKES IT EVEN MORE WORTH THE $30!MAKE SURE THERE'S NO DISC IN THE DVD PLAYER!All with remote:1.Power on2.Hold setup and press vol+,vol-,vol+,vol-, the RC appears on the upper left of the screen3.Release setup button, with the cursor left and right select the RC 225 (do not punch the numbers - select with cursor)4.Exit setup5.Power off=]"
5,Coby-224 DVD Player,"I have had my Coby-224 DVD player for a couple of weeks,and it hasbeen used by myself several times.The remote control works well and iseasy to use.This DVD player plays major studio DVDs perfectly.Do not hesitate to buy this DVD player.The Coby-224 DVD player is so inexpensive,that you need not feel guilty for purchasing one."
1,"The item I received does not work at all, No disc detected.",I received the dvd player today. It can not detect any dvd that I put in. No DISC was showing all the time. Do Not buy it. I already printed out return label and will return tomorrow. It's a waste of time.
1,You get what you pay for,"Its true what they say you do get what you pay for. When i first got this player, 8months ago, the remote didn't work, but since i had a universal remote control i didn't let that bother me. 7(1/2) months later after mild usage, it stopped working. When i tried the playback while watching a dvd just a couple weeks ago it just went blank on me. I guess it stopped reading the dvd but i wouldn't know since it didn't even have an error message. After that it wouldn't even open to let me retrive the dvd inside and i had to yank it out."
1,Garbage,I bought this unit for guests and for people to watch while ill. It had less tan 10 hours of use before it died. It was plugged into a power strip desiged to protect it from power surges. Unfortunately the warrenty was only 90 days. Tried to use it today and it was completely dead. No power light and no response from the remote (installed new batteries). In my opinion you get what you pay for. I went cheap and got cheap. Made in China.
2,weird,"This product comes with a HUGE red and yellow lable GLUED to the top of the player warning about various troubleshooting issues. It really looks terrible and since we plan to place this unit on the top of a table, it goes without saying that this lable that covers 80% of the top of the unit that WILL NOT come off makes a pretty terrible eyesore.the product looks like something that was returned and then slapped with a lable saying its funtioning correctly.In light of the fact that Colby felt compelled to GLUE on this warning lable so no one would miss it,my advice woudl be to stay away."
3,What it comes with,This product does NOT come with any hook up cables....you must buy them .....it comes as a box with the electric plug and a remote...that's it. Take the owners manual to the Walmart store and go to Electronics to ask for help.
1,Fine until it broke.,"I understand that I should have low expectiations with the price, but I expected it to work longer then 45 days. When it was working the only drawback was the remote which has 56 evenly spaced buttons that are all the same size so you better have the lights on if you are trying to use it!"
1,Exactly what you pay for,"Yes, you get what you pay for with this item!! I had mine for thirty one days, then it stopped working with the error No Disc even though there is a disc in it. I contacted Coby and they said ""sorry, out of the thirty day warranty"" but the store I bought it from replaced it for me. The second player worked with little to moderate use for four months and then again, the No Disc error.After researching on the internet, you can find many and varied horror stories about this product and almost all of them recommend not to buy it! Buyers beware!"
1,Garbage...,"This thing is a piece of trash.. At first it worked fine but about a week later, it pretty much stopped reading every type of DVD.. and those that did work, skipped constantly, even if I just opened a brand new DVD.. Definately do not buy this, its worth the extra $10-20 for a quality one that will get the job done.. BUYERS BEWARE!"
4,"for your kitchen, garage, attic, or bathroom","For the price and quality, the coby dvd-224 is a good choice for the kitchen, garage or someplace where a dvd player would be convenient, but not your primary system. I really don't need a dvd player in my kitchen, but given the price of this unit, I felt that the convenience was worth it.Basically - don't expect much. It's a lightweight unit with mediocre playback quality and functionality. And I think that's fair, given the budget pricing. If what you want is a basic functional player - as a backup or for a rarely-used location, then this model will do just fine. I've probably used this about a dozen times, with no problems. If I had been planning on racking up hundreds of hours on it, I would have bought a better model.For casual use in a non-primary setting, this is fine. That's pretty much what my review is: This is ok. Nothing special, but functionally fine."
1,It stopped working after a week,I bought this one and it worked for a week and stopped working after a week. When I put the DVD it revolves and revolves for ever. I wont buy this product again and I dont recomment to buy it.Its waste of time and Money.
2,Don't get this one if you want to play PAL discs on NTSC TV,"The NTSC PAL conversion on this model doesn't work properly, I've tried it on several different units. If you play a PAL disc and convert to NTSC, a pulsating blurriness affects the image. Spend $20 more and get something better."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this dvd player back in March. A few weeks ago it stopped turning on completely. It's turned on once since then but has not turned on again. It's a waste of money. It would be better to spend even a bit more money on a dvd player that is going to last. Unfortunately, it stopped working after the return period so I'm stuck with it and can only buy a new one. I am not pleased with this product at all. Don't waste your money!"
1,Poor Quality,"After a few months, this DVD player stopped recognizing that a DVD was inserted. Maybe it can be fixed, but for the price its not worth the bother."
5,"Small Form Factor, Yet Capable Region FREE DVD Player","We bought this region FREE DVD player, just to play Chinese dubbed movies (region 6) DVDs. We bought on recommendations from various Amazon users.It works great! All my Chinese dubbed movie DVDs (of region 6) will play well in this DVD Player. (It even plays a DVD someone labeled as ""Damaged"" with a sharpie pen on both sides.)The only thing is you will need to spend approx 10 minutes to reprogram the DVD player through punching in a few key sequence on the remote so that it becomes region FREE. This model is shipped from the manufacturer as capable of playing region 1 (North America) only. We called the manufacturer's tech support, and they walked me through reprogramming on the remote control. With only 10 minutes, it is playing all DVDs (all regions) from around the world, not only our Chinese dubbed movies (which is region 6).Review written by Chinese Dubbed Movies on 02/09/2011."
1,"don't get it, unless you are willing to buy a new one every 3 month","It is a bad one. It failed on me on the very first day (fresh out of the box). I got a new one, and it failed right after their warranty (90 days).It played region 2 DVD with no problem, as the region 1 too. But now I am looking for more expensive model and hope that one will work better."
1,Not worth the money,"Sorry to say this dvd player is not worth the money, i was looking for something cheap and good, and it was cheap. But the conection is bad and I have lines in my picture and it's not my tv and other dvd players work fine. It does play all types of rewrites and music, but those lines drive me insane. So I have it in its box stuffed in my closet because I refuse to use it. I will have to find another more expensive brand of dvd player, because I watch dvd's all the time with home system and the whole nine yards. It my passion and hobby and I like Coby, but this player just sucks. and it isn't worth spending money to send it back. Don't waste your time with this product."
1,Broken after 4 months,"This was a cute little player while it lasted. It made a horrible noise whenever it played a disk, but once it got going, it was okay. Then right after the manufacturer's warranty was up, the door stopped opening. I called them to see what they could do because the warranty states that ""parts"" are covered for a year. Apparently what they consider ""parts"" are cables and remote controls. Silly me. I assumed parts are what they used to put the thing together. She suggested I take it to a repair shop. It's not worth repairing. I'm going to go buy Sony or another brand that I trust."
1,Remote hard to replace,"I purchased this for my daughter and the remote has broken. It is impossible to replace with a universal remote. The manufacturer has been uncooperative in helping to replace the remote. They keep saying the remote is ""back-ordered"" since we ordered one from them in July. Now they say it will not be available until November. Do not purchase this item - spend a few dollars more and get one from a name brand company that is easier to deal with replacement parts."
1,Don't buy this!,"I bought this DVD player about 3 weeks ago. It was working fine until it just died. I played a movie for my son, it ended so I took the DVD out shut it off. Now, it won't turn back on. I can't return it because my son used the box to play in. Don't waste your money! Now, I have to buy another so what I thought was a cheap option has gotten more expensive than needed."
2,Photo Not Accurate- Buyer Beware,"The remote control pictured with this unit is not the one that actually comes with the DVD player. The player itself is pretty limited in functionality, but it works pretty good to just play DVD's and thats about it. The player is basically useless if you lose the remote or if it breaks. The remotes are pretty flimsy. Universal codes for remotes don't exist for the player, or if they do they aren't easy to look up.I've contacted Amazon twice that the picture of the remote is incorrect, but they haven't done anything about it. You are really better off spending a few extra dollars for a better unit."
1,Broken so easily,"I bought this DVD player in late May and was away for the summer. I started using it two weeks ago, probably 3 to 4 times till now. I haven't been able to played any DVDs since last night. This really sucks!"
3,Adequate. Value/price proportionate.,"No bells. No whistles. Does what was expwcted/stated. I am satisfied with what my limited resources afforded me. I am happy that Amazon could/chose to provide it. (Sorrento , FL)"
2,Coby DVD-224ss Compact DVD Player (Purchased on 12/27/2007),"I would love to have reviewed the Coby Compact DVD player, but sadly I bought it as a gift to a friend in Memphis, Tennessee. Since I live in Scotland, it's rather hard being asked to review something I never saw in the flesh.All I could say it , the price was right for the spec. of the machine."
1,DO NOT ORDER DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON,"I ordered this DVD player on DEC 23 should have gotten it on Jan4, here it is afternoon Jan 5 and it still hasnt been delivered. Amazon uses DHL that means no matter where it comes from it is shipped to OHIO and sits there a few days then it is shipped to your state and handed over to the post office and it sits there a couple of days and you might get it a MONTH after you order it. BUY FROM AMAZON MERCHANTS ONLY they at least give you a choice of shippers!! Amazon has lost a 10 yr customer over this F**K up"
1,Garbage,"This DVD player is garbage. We bought it about 5 yrs ago or less and ever since we bought it, we had trouble with it. We lost receipt otherwise it would have been back to the store. It didn't always read all DVD's or it would skip,and so we'd have to use the one upstairs in our bedroom. Now it doesn't even work. It turns on but it ejects the DVD and won't play. You might as well spend more money on something that will work and not add more garbage to the landfills"
3,good as long as it works,This is good because it plays everything.But it is not a long lasting DVD players . It worked for 2.5 yrs. I would expect it to work longer.
1,"Por primera vez desde que compro en amazon.com, algo llega que no sirve","Hola Amazon.com, desde hace años que compro diversos objetos con Uds.,por primera vez pedí el DVD COBY, se instaló y se oía pero no se veía,no lo devolví porque había botado la caja. No tengo buena experiencia.Dinah"
2,gold remaster,"the worst sound ever on ride the tiger. can do without the long version of miracles and light the sky on fire. the best long versions i like are caroline, st.charles,love to good, runaway and hyperdrive. i have compared the 1991 digitally remaster release compared to the 1998 remaster. the 91 sound way alot better. except for a little tape hiss and cut versions of the songs."
4,Listen on vinyl,On my turntable this sounds as good as it did in the day. I recently re-discovered my LP's. This is record is always at hand. How come no body ever talks about Craig C. the guitar player?
5,Awesome CD,One of the best and most underrated heavy metal bands of all time. I first got their Hit and Run and Screaming Blue Murder albums when they first came out and am still listening to them today. This CD compilation has all the best songs from their best albums...their first three. I just wish there were more songs from the awesome album Screaming Blue Murder.
4,A great book for novice writers,"Through this book, Josip Novakovich helps novice writers gain confidence, experience, and skill. He does this not by coddling writers as if they were pre-school children palying at finger paints, but by making them work hard to attain their goal. Although not all of the 200+ exercises interested me, I found most of them to be interesting enough and several to be quite engaging. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wanted to write fiction but wasn't sure where to begin. Also, it's a good text for more advanced writers who have encountered that dreaded ailment: writer's block."
4,A Great Book,"This book is excellent for those who are interested in writing fiction. I think it would make a good book for a high school or college course as well--so few good ones exist. This book, while written in a flowing, 'non-textbook', easily understood style, is more informing than many textbooks I have seen on the subject.It is well organized--even if you have some writing experience, you might still find yourself flipping through the chapters when you have a question on, per se, plot or characterization. And best of all, it endorses learning by doing, including several exercises at the end of each chapter."
5,A master storyteller,"Only a master storyteller could write about the art of story telling the way Novakovich does. Without being intricate, he clearly sketches the way how to become a successful writer of fiction. Indeed worth reading! One of my most used quotes from this book is: ""Out of a place, a character is formed; out of a character's motives, plot may follow"" (Novakovich, 1995: 28). This reaffirms my conviction that space (setting)has a vitally important role in fiction.By: Helene de Kock - author of WHEN DEATH BECOMES LIFE - WWW.AMAZON.COM"
2,Not Really Instruction--More a String of Exercises,"This book is less a book of instruction and more a series of exercises for a would-be writer to perform.I was kind of disappointed. I mean, going in, I knew that, say plot and character and dialogue were all important. I was hoping for some sort of discussion on what makes a good plot, or a compelling character, etc. Instead, Josip merely says (roughly) that ""Having good characters is important. Here are some exercises for you to write characters: 1) Take a person you know, and describe him. 2) Imagine that person's total opposite, and describe him. (Etc.)""I've enjoyed other books more when they've discussed what makes a good character versus a bad one, or a good plot, or good dialogue, or what have you. This collection of writing prompts wasn't what I was looking for, but maybe it's what you'd like? If so, recommended."
3,Halfway there.,"Book of this sort either come as well written/informational or well decorated. That is, good font choice and page layouts, and interesting charts and quotes and what not. This book manages to get a little of both making it a little less monotonous to read in the long haul."
1,You call this Conditioner?,"This ""conditioner"" had zero condition in it. It was very thin, not creamy, and left my hair begging for moisture. I could only use it for 1 week before I had to throw it away and get special repair products to mend my parched locks. I don't recommend this product. (I also had the shampoo)"
3,Nostalgic Look Back,"Certainly I agree with former reviews. ""Get Together"" along with Still's ""For What It's Worth"" have to be the two most symbolic 60s ""movement"" anthems of all time. I once heard Robert Plant do ""Darkness Darkness"" live and it reminded me of the potential JC Young had for writing good songs. It is a shame he couldn't have been more productive even on this collection. The rest of the CD is worse than filler. Oh yes, there is no way that this band even touched the talent of the Lovin Spoonful or that even a comparison of the two should be made!"
1,Its been done!,At my local Barnes and Nobles I picked up and leafed thru a copy.All I read was the same rehash of ideas done decades before. Immanuel Velikovsky and Werner Keller. This has offered nothing new to those who have been studying this Biblical drama as long as the author if not longer.
1,Boring. Pro Religious Agenda,"Colin Humphreys rehashes the old news we've heard many times before (on NatGeo or the History Channel) about how the red bacteria in the Nile killed the fish, which brought the frogs a-hopping etc. and etc.This author uses the word ""PROBABLY"" and ""REMARKABLE"" and ""BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT"" as though they are new words he just discovered and added to his vocabulary.He says everything happened ""NATURALLY"" (ie. the wind caused the Red Sea to open for the Israelites to cross, Mount Sinai was a Volcano, the burning Bush was a volcano vent etc.) but then he EMPHASIZES that the miracle was the TIMING of everything. In other words the Good Lord used NATURE to achieve his Historical World Changing Agenda.This is a great book to read if you are an Evangelical Christian.If you're an Atheist or regular Joe, don't waste your time. The book is long and boring and outdated."
5,A gripping good read,"This isn't the kind of book I'd normally pick up. But from the first page I was hooked. It was really refreshing to hear about the Bible from a man who's a committed Christian *and* a scientist. Humphreys takes the writings of Exodus and shows that, although events have natural causes, this makes them more miraculous than ever - the fact that the Red Sea parted just when it was most needed is indeed a true miracle of timing! Humphreys spices things up with quirky personal anecdotes scattered throughout the book, making this is a great read for anyone who likes popular science books, religious or not."
5,GREAT album,"As always, just a great band from PULA!!! NOTE: Actually, this is two of their albums on one CD: 1. Glupost je neunistiva 2. Mis mo ovdje samo zbog para (minus 1 song)I love it, and I have all of their albums!!"
2,Not sure why I bought this.,I bought this thinking it would benefit my bettas but I think it had very little affect on them. You are better off buying indian almond leaves.
3,Not so sure,"Seems like a good product in what it states it does. However, just not so sure about it. I put it in a couple of my tanks. Water got a brown tint as expected. When I came back 15 minutes later the water was crystal clear once more. I noticed that my filters which had been clean (corner filters with floss and bio-rings only, no charcoal) now were dark brown. So basically within 15 minutes this product was filtered out and trapped within the filter floss. So I can assume anything beneficial in this product was also sucked up by the filters. Therefore, just not sure it's worth getting."
4,"heavy duty rock, for all music lover's","If you like your music hard with good a good rthym section you can't go wrong with this cd. When you hear disc's like this you wonder what could have been if they went onto another disc or two but, we'll never know so buy this one and enjoy."
4,The HIP are back!!!,"Just got the album today, and with just a couple listens under my belt, it is a good album. As a huge HIP fan I have been very disappointed with their last several efforts. This album is far better than Music at Work, In violet Light and Phantom Power. Hard driving riffs with good melodies combined with Gord's trademark lyrics. The production value is way better than recent albums and with more focus on Downie's voice (which is how it should be, dammit)"
3,Good but not great,"This is my first review.Bought this the first week it was released. I was after hearing two tracks from it which I purchased on Puretracks. I enjoyed those two songs a lot (Vaccination Scar, Summer's Killing Us) and I thought the whole album would have the catchy groove of those songs.The good thing about this album is that it's fast paced and full of rock songs. The bad thing is that it lacks the classic Hip soft song which is always good.Overall its worth a listen. Get it if you enjoy The Hip at all because it's pretty close to their overall sound.Highlights: Vaccination Scar, Summer's Killing Us, Gus: The Polar Bear from Central Park.Maybe I need to give it another few listens and let the music sink in a little."
2,i dunno......,"ever since day for night, these guys have been hit or miss. mostly miss. i was encouraged by their last outing, in violet light, and was looking forward to in between evolution, but i find myself disappointed again. there is no spark here. downie seems more interested in being the ""poet lauriet"" than a lead singer. the band seems disinterested. i'm going back to the four classics,up to here, road apples, fully completely and day for night....."
2,Not as melodic or memorable as past achievments,"I was rather disappointed by this album as I thought it was rather weak compared to their previous album and other albums of the past. Musically, In Between Evolution is very similar to Music@work sounding very raw and the music is not melodic enough to remember and enjoy like we did on past albums like DAy for Night or Fully Completely. I have been a hip fan since 1994 and have given this CD more than enough spins to come to this conclusion. For a new hip fan, start out with older albums like Phantom Power, Trouble at the Henhouse, Day for Night and Fully Completely."
5,Consistently great.,"There are few bands that are as consistently solid as the Tragically Hip. I would group them with the Red Hot Chilli Peppers in that respect. This is a GREAT album. I sugest actually buying it. It's the first cd I've bought in a long while. But if you like their music support them instead of downloading it.Ride on,~Andrew Lee"
5,These guys just keep bringing it!,"Once again the THip have come out with a beauty. As all those die hard Hip fans know, the tunes get better every time you hear them. What surprises me most about this album is that I loved every song the first time. It reminds me a lot of their 2nd album, Up to Here. Solid from top to bottom. ""Vaccination Scar"" is a great tune and one of my personal favorites is, ""It Can't Be Nashville Every Night."" Hats off to the ultimate Canadian Band. Now if the rest of the US would just give these guys a listen I guarantee they wouldn't be disappointed."
4,Following the Artistic Movement,"At first, I was unnerved by the minor change in style, but i started listening to it more and more. I think it is sort of a logical progression in The Hip's musical development. They seem to be following a style progression which incorporates the Alternative Rock which recently became popular in the United States (i.e.- Modest Mouse, Franz Ferdinand) which is also evident in the cover art. I see it as an album that is simply following the common artistic movement of the present time. It really is a great one."
4,"vocally - too distracting, BUT musically - very satisfying","I very much agree with previous reviewer, Hal Johnson. This could have been a great Hip disc, but the vocals -- go way beyond the once beautifully idiosyncratic typical Hip stuff -- to be distractingly out of tune with a lack of the usual presence and depth... moreover, the production is messy and spotty (vs. In Violet Light).YET (and infuriatingly so), the songs are mostly wonderful, hence my 4-star rating... upon repeated listenings these shine through, and the faults are (mostly) overlooked... sort of like love in a long-term relationship...lol.Long live the Hip!"
4,Amendment to previous post,"After being unable to clear the splotches, and being too tired to return the second set, I spent much of the night researching the problem on the net and by speaking with electronics minded people that I know. The consensus opinion was that the splotches likely resulted from static or magnetic buildup on the picture tube. These are supposed to be cleared by a degaussing circuit when the set is turned on. The next day, before returning the second unit, I turned it on and, lo and behold, the splotches were cleared. Since that time (and through the Super Bowl) the picture has been tremendous. I felt compelled to post this experience as it may be that the degaussing circuit on these sets may not clear the field when the set is first turned on. Perhaps Samsung should warn users about this. The initial rating of ""3"" is rising fast. Still watching for reoccurence of the problem, however."
1,2 Years and Dead,This T.V. is one of the heaviest TV's I have ever owned. It weighs more than my 60 Inch Flat Screen.About 3-4 months ago it started making this high pitched squealing noise. Very loud to the point you could not even hear the shows on TV.Well this week the TV has now decided to just shut it's self off whenever it wants.I have an old RCA probably 7 years old that lasted longer than this 100lb Paper Weight.Avoid this and all other CRT Samsung's at all costs. Read more reviews around the net. It might be good for the first year or two but you will just be throwing away your money if you buy this Piece of Doggy Poop.
3,"Great TV, BUT!!!","I bought this TV after reading a lot of reviews and figured an EDTV is the best choice for low budget and the closest to HDTV. One thing I noticed is I bought the TXP2745FP, but the manual said it's a TXP2745P not sure what the difference is. The picture quality was great. Everything about this TV is great EXCEPT one major annoying problem: It produces a high pitch sound even when the TV is on mute. I disconnected all connections to make sure there is no external cause. I found out the high pitch sound comes from inside the TV. If I turn it off it goes away. Then it comes back after watching TV for about an hour. Some days it doesn't come at all. But when it comes its Really annoying. I am trying to find out why this noise comes and if I can stop it, otherwise this TV is going back ASAP."
4,The Dolly Sisters,"If you like old-time musicals you'll enjoy this. I loved ""The Dolly Sisters"" as a kid and later on wondered if VHS or DVD existed but doubted it. I was happy to find a copy at a decent price. I still love it but see that it's not as ""glitzy"" as I thought it was when I was young. I still love the music and always liked the Stars who were in it. I'm very happy that I bought it."
1,Overblown Cheap Gaudy Melodrama,"After enjoying the wonderfully restored Down Argentine Way and Moon Over Miami, I was prepared for pretty much the same formula. Alas, this turgid tale of sisterly bonds versus marriage vows drags and insults the intelligence. Nobody watches this stuff for the plot, but somebody thought the plot meant something here, so the songs, dances and costumes get draped over it, whether they fit or not. The vaudeville numbers are unremarkable and the rainbow song gets oh-so-tedious with repetition. By the time this movie was made in 1945, blackface was out, but it gets thrown back at us in the name of history. The only thing worth remembering about this mess are the Ziegfield numbers."
4,"BETTY GRABLE , HELLO DOLLY (SISTERS)","BETTY GRABLE, this is 1945 Betty is Queen of TechnicolorFox want to make a biog of the DOLLY SISTERS, Alice Faye is family bound Alice got a raw deal from Fox with Fallen Angel so she did a runner, Rita Hayworth was busy at Columbia so Betty had to settle for June Haver as co-star Haver was 10 years younger than Grable but it was Betty,s movie in Technicolor"
3,Good work.,"Before I review this, a couple facts have to be explained. Yes, VOICES brought Hall and Oates out of obscurity and into the top artists of the decade. And yes, VOICES has some great songs on it. Those four, which are ""Kiss On My List,"" ""You Make My Dreams,"" ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling,"" and ""How Does It Feel To Be Back,"" all hit the Top Forty and are among Hall and Oates's best work. There are a couple more good ones, likethe jungle-like ""Africa,"" and a tribute to doo wop music ""Diddy Doo Wop (I Hear the Voices)."" But the others are unremarkable filler tracks (espicially ""Gotta Lotta Nerve [Perfect Perfect]""). So on the overall, VOICES is on the overrated. It seems that people took into consideration too much that it was the record that made Hall and Oates superstars rather than look at it song by song and see what it's really like. VOICES is still worth having, though, since ""How Does It Feel To Be Back"" is not available on any hits compilation anywhere."
3,"Smile of the Buddha, very good vender, not so great book","Smile of the Buddha was delivered in excellent timing and in brand new condition. However, as for the content of the book itself, I wouldn't recommend it. Personally I have to have this book for a class I'm taking on Japan and the West, but so far the book seems as if it wasn't written by an English First Language speaker, which would be fine if it weren't also trying hard to use college textbook English. So in short, definitely buy from this seller, but avoid this book if its not assigned by a professor."
3,Did not RETURN,"Very, very short, not at all like The Story of O. Not the same energy, excitement. Could not stand the ending, OMG! Huge let down."
2,Not A Return I Would Have Made,"This book was a quick and easy read. It certainly was not as interesting as the original story of O. It left a lot to be desired and the interactions O had with people were not drawn out, just quick snippets of action. I would have liked more of a story an understanding of why Sir Stephen was returning her and why Carl was so determined to own her. It feels like this was written in a short rush to get something done. Not something I would recommend reading if you enjoyed the original story of O."
1,"Help me, please!","As far as I know, this is not the original ending to Story of O. In the original, O commits suicide when she finds out her master has abandoned her. I cannot find the original for anything. (Granted, I haven't tried too terribly hard, but...) I would greatly appreciate any leads or information. The original French is fine. Email me: love_erni@yahoo.comMore on the topic, I agree, this version bites. In the intro, the *author* gives a disclaimer: she doesn't think the same way she used to. O has changed in her mind. Nothing about the Chateau resembles the original. I wonder if even a different person wrote it. Hmmmm."
1,Disappointing.,"After searching for this book for so long, I finally found it - unfortunately. I guess there was nothing left to do after the Story Of O. Absolutely nothing happens in this book. The writing style doesn't even seem the same. You are much better off getting The Passive Voice by G.C. Scott. That book is written in the style of the Story Of O only not quite as dark."
2,Disappointing,"Story of O had me fascinated but the sequel just left me feeling disappointed. If you have read O, then I would advise you to stick with its endings rather than the one offered by Return to the Chateau, as it is simply a let-down."
4,Worth reading if you love the story of O,If you have never heard of the story of O and read it then this is definitely a must read. The style is pretty close but not perfect. If you enjoyed The Story of O then you will enjoy this.
5,Top of the Game,"I have all of Chis LeDoux's albums between records, tapes, and CDs. This one has always been one of my favorites, right down to the picture on the cover. The title track has always been a fan-favorite LeDoux track. Along with it, there are the old-time concert staples, Six Bucks A Day, Lean Mean And Hungry, Hippies In Calgary, and the cover of Night Rider's Lament. This album is a great representation of what Chris was back in 1978, without sounding stale or overdone. Basically, you can split Chris' career up into two parts... 1972 thru 1989, and then 1990 thru 2003. This one is obviously in the early part, and it shows well. Fans will know what to expect, and newcomers will get a perfectly painted picture of what they might find on his other early albums. Other standout tracks include Getting By A Quarter At A Time, Cowcamp Blues, and Ain't Had Time To Go Home."
5,Great CD,I've been a fan of the Bodeans since Love&Hope&Sex&Dreams came out in 80's. Their albums evoke a certain sense of time and place in my life. Listening to this new CD takes me back one more time. The songs are catchy and my 3 year old boy is constantly asking me to replay them. What further recommendation do you need? My boy knows music.
3,BoDeans Back in Action,"Just like many other BoDeans fans, finally, after 8 years we have a new album to enjoy. The new disc, ""Resolution"", is a nice mix of the classic BoDeans sound along with some drum loops to anchor the tunes. Some standout fun, rockin' songs are ""(We Can) Live"", ""Wild World, and ""Marianne"". Those 3 songs will be fun songs for the band to play when on tour. Some of my favorite ballads are ""Sleep"" and ""Slipping Into You"". My minor disappoitment with the album is the over production of the orchestration and Kurt's lead guitar really sticks out on many of the tracks. I like the BoDeans sounds a bit more edgy. Would like to hear a bit better mix. Overall, I recommend this album to purchase and to use as a background to the summer ahead."
2,Early BoDeans wouldn't have put their name on this,"At least twice as slick and glossy as it should have been and at most half as creative and interesting as hoped for. The BoDeans have sadly gone from an interesting rock band to just another over-produced wimp-rock outfit. It actually hurts to say this but it's 100% true: if while listening to this album for the first time someone told you it was Bon Jovi, you'd believe them. You'd believe them. There's nothing more to say."
2,Where are the answers?,"During a difficult recovery from bulimia, I sought out emotional advice from those who had been through similar perils and had recovered to an admiral degree. I bought Feeding the hungry heart and read through it as fast and deperately as I would a quart of ice cream. The book is really a culmination of women's stories who had been compulsive eaters and had recovered by taking seminars from the author. While I could certainly relate to much of what was said, I found the stories to be depressing; leaving me with a bit of hopelessness. Never was it thoroughly explained exactly what these women did to lead to a recovery. I felt cheated; as if this was just the prequel to the book with the answers. I wasn't about to pay another $10.00 to find them."
3,"Lots of other women's stories, but some hidden gems","Feeding the Hungry Heart: The Experience of Emotional Eating is a book I've wanted to read for some time. I'm an emotional eater and I was interested to read what Roth, a noted ""expert"" on overeating and emotional eating had to say. This book is 25 years old, and focused on a lot of case stories (mostly women married to uncaring men!).I found a lot to resonate with, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was reading the ""left overs"" of another better book, and I probably was as I've since discovered this was about the third book Roth had written on the topic. I plan on hunting down her first book as I have a feeling it will have more of the information I'm looking for about emotional eating and less of the stories from women who have the problem."
5,earth shaking,"I bought this book three or four years ago now, in the heat of my battle with bulimia. I learned that COE had a lot of the same aspects as my disorder, and I really wanted to see how other people felt before, during, and after our shared binges.This book made me smile, think, and even cry. I've read it four times through, and I am constantly flipping back to read my favorite stories even to this day. It gives me strength both by knowing that others have felt the same as I do, and that they have pressed through and moved on to better days. It also gave me a different perspective on why I eat emotionally sometimes, and how I can cope with some feelings I don't cherish."
2,Feeding the Hungry Heart Left Me Empty,"This book,first written in 1982, is a far cry from Roth's ""Women Food and God."" It's a depressing, intense sharing of prose and poetry (much fictional) from a host of women who were coping with compulsive overeating. Instead of helping me with my eating issues, it dragged me down to a level of melancholy I had not yet experienced over my problem. I found that this book focused me more than ever on food, while Women Food and God focused me on the way out. Disappointing yet predictable for a first book while Roth herself was still struggling with food."
5,GREAT!!,"I absolutely adore this book! I truly think this is the only book you will ever need to stop binging, I like how there are real stories in here as well and it has parts from geneen too. Get this book! It is cheap and isnt a waste of money at all! I cannot recommend this enough!"
2,no real substance,"About the only thing I got from this author is that she suffered from compulsive eating. I agree that you must learn to love yourself, but this woman gives no concrete information on how to do that. I read most of her books about 3 years ago, and even went to one of her seminars. The only thing I learned is that she is rude in person, and the seminar was like one big infomercial pushing her other books. I saw a lot of others there who were struggling with compulsive eating, which was helpful, but we all left feeling like, ""now what?""."
5,terrific,"all systems go: received quickly, in good order, book in excellent shape, in fact the plus is the book was very helpful to me"
1,"Lies, lies, lies","The following four quotes are all ascribed to Hitler by Rauschning. Hitler did not utter one of them, not one. How this book managed to get such high ratings only goes to show the extent to which people believe what they want to believe.Truth is truth even if no one believes it and a lie is a lie even if everyone believes it.""They refer to me as an uneducated barbarian. Yes, we are barbarians. We want to be barbarians, it is an honored title to us. We shall rejuvenate the world. This world is near its end.""""A violently active, dominating, intrepid, brutal youth -- that is what I am after ... I want to see in its eyes the gleam of pride and independence, of prey. I will have no intellectual training. Knowledge is the ruin of my young men.""""Terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death.""""I am liberating man from the degrading chimera known as conscience,""""Destroy by all and any means. National Socialism will reshape the world."""
3,Love Brooks & Dunn But....,"Maybe I'm not as hip to how B&D's albums are supposed to sound but Steers & Stripes isn't a strong set of songs in my opinion. The songs that they released are the only good ones. Those songs I absolutely love- Only In America, My Heart Is Lost To You, and Ain't Nothing 'Bout You. Every River still fails to catch my ear. I think My Heart Is Lost To You is the best song. There are fourteen tracks and only three stand out to me- that's not good. I love the cover, love the packaging, love the title but musically Steers & Stripes is not very entertaining at all. Oh, well...."
4,Buy it now dont wait,Brooks&Dunn---Have captured a fun senuous and patriotic video.KIx wrote the song(ONLY IN AMERICA)months before Sept11.thankfully he did.As a Canadaian I was truly touched an moved by the song.They also managed in the rest of the album to give everyone a touch of everything a album should have.
3,Brooks and Dunn are NO longer the best duo!!!,"I have waited with reservations for this new album by Brooks and Dunn. Since their Greatest Hits album was released, they have gone downhill and it seems not at a slow pace. This album has some good tracks and the rest are just filler. I will skip those songs and probably never listen to them again. The standout song is GO WEST!!!! It is an awesome song! The other good songs on the album are THE LONG GOODBYE, WHEN SHE'S GONE SHE'S GONE, UNLOVED, EVERY RIVER and SEE JANE DANCE and AIN'T NOTHING 'BOUT YOU. That is 7 of the 14 songs. The other 7 are blah blah blah! On some of those songs, they sound like they are wining and it bugged me to no end! I love good music but the 7 other tracks are not good. Simple as That. Be careful with buying this cd! If you want a great new cd, go buy LORRIE MORGAN AND SAMMY KERHSAW'S I FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE! Read my review of that. Thanks!"
2,Disappointing effort,"I've got all their CDs; couldn't wait for this one to come out. Boy was I disappointed. ""Ain't nothing 'bout you"" was terrific on the radio and I was anticipating a CD full of good stuff. The only other track worth listening to is ""My Heart is Lost to You."" The rest of it is rock-n-roll disguised with a country twang. Sorry guys, you blew it with this one. Give me back my honky-tonk."
1,no dance music,"what happened? this album [stinks], i like to dance and this has nothing but a bunch of rock and roll or mournfull [C.R.U.D.] im sorry i bought it, i was expecting some cowboy cha cha-2step-western swingin music. the only song redemable is aint nothin bout you...sorry guys....i'm not a [...] who cares about your musical development, i wanna dance and have fun!"
3,a decent country album,brooks and Dunn put up a good album here the best song has to be Somethign About You Brooks and Dunn have done better though so i can only give them 3 stars
4,Good Album,"I was curious to hear the album as I love the song 'The Long Goodbye'. I heard that song from Ronan Keating as he co-wrote it with Paul Brady. I'm very fond of 'My Heart Is Lost To You'and I love 'When she's gone, she's gone'. I must say that Brooks & Dunn album is very good and I like it a lot but I prefer Ronan Keating version of the Long Goodbye."
4,Very good album to end their stagnant period,"I recall that Brooks & Dunn's '98 and '99 albums before this one were unlistenable at best, even relying on a John Waite '80s song for a remake. But this album is a surprise turnaround. Every song on here is entertaining and the music is astounding. I like the patriotic Only In America. There are still the wild rocking numbers that they're known for. My favorite here is""Ain't Nothin' Bout You."" The bridges and landscapes are so smoothly done. Sometimes the beats in the chorus come very close to one on a hip-hop song, because there's such a funkiness to this mostly country record. This is a smartly done album and I look forward to getting Red Dirt Road soon."
4,Timeless facts.,It has been really interesting to read about all the facts and rumours known about this noble breed more than one hundred years ago. The pictures in the book are quite helpful in getting an appropriate idea of all the dogs. And the probably most amazing thing about this book is that almost all the facts are still valid and relevant.
3,Just get John Frieda,"I followed the instructions exactly:1) Apply to wet (not towel dried) hair.2) Comb through from root to tip.3) Reapply if necessary (I didn't because I have short hair).This product certainly made my hair more manageable and silkier than without any product. However, I expected to have really straight and relaxed hair with just a blow-dry. Nope, I still had to run my hair through a flat iron. That's what I was trying to avoid! I wash my hair every other day and after consistent use I felt my hair started to become rubbery. To me, that's a sign of over-processing. So, I gave it a break. Now I use it sporadically.Honestly, I don't see much of an improvement over John Frieda's Frizz-Ease Straight Fixation cream. They both basically do the same thing to my hair."
1,"Using ""nothing"" works better","The only thing of value in this product is the high priced marketing. used it 3 times, to ensure I used it properly-hair perfect dampness, used different amounts. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! My hair looked the same as if it were without any product. But, hey, guys at Phyto? Good Marketing!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"After reading all the reviews, I bought this product with such high hopes to help tame my coarse, curly hair . I wish I hadn't wasted my money."
2,All that Glitters is Not Gold,"Heard about this product in some major fashion mags. bought it, tried it and not impressed. There are MANY hair relaxing/straightening balms, creams,serums, etc. on the market and this one, for me, isn't any better than some others I've tried. P.S. I have naturally kinky hair."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this product because I read that it was supposed to take the frizz out of your hair and make it soft and smooth. Well, it didn't do anything like that. I'm sorry, but would not purchase again. Maybe it will work for someone that does not color their hair."
3,A lot,This thing is ok... I have to put a whole lot on for it to actually take affect and I'm not into that messiness.
4,God product.,"This product is very good for my hair, which is thick and some frizz on the ends. Only have to use a small amount to control the frizz. First product to work on my hair, after spending much money on other products. It is expensive but it does work."
4,Great!,Perfect for straight styles. Apply starting at the roots; give one pass with a flat iron and your style will remain straight for a few days.
2,not worth it,I bought this product due to reviews. I wonder who does these positive reviews. It's pricey for such a small product. It did nothing to my hair. I expected to feel/see some difference and nothing. It did absolutely nothing for my hair.
2,What a letdown,"My hair is more wavy than curly and during the summer it is frizzy as well. This product made my hair feel soft and improved the frizziness, but as far as straightening hair.....NO. After blow drying it looked the same. I still needed to use a flat iron throughout my entire head, not just for touchups. I tried letting it air dry, no change. It's too expensive for a product that does what many cheaper salon products do."
5,"love this product, keeps the frizz at bay!","I have thick, naturally wavy/curly hair. Once it gets humid, it's a mass of frizz. I've tried severalanti-frizz products and none work as well (if at all) as this. Plus, this has no odor, is not heavy, does notleave any kind of discernible residue and I use it on wet or dry hair. It's pricey, but a little goesa long way. My hair looks soft and shiny. I don't use it to straighten, just to de-frizz the curls."
4,classic pair,"What a matchup! Carlos Santana and Alice Coltrane join together in this classic pairing of spiritual,meditative music...at one time in Santana's life he was a devoted follower of Guru Sri Chinmoy,and the music here is reflective of where he was at in his spiritual path,and although it is recreated here,the sound quality is not up to par,but it is a record of the time and acceptable for finding that part of you that gives glory to the Most High..."
5,"Another ""Desert Island"" CD","I first heard this when I was in my teens, when my old guitar teacher used to play it. I always loved Santana's playing, but (as a fellow reviewer also said) I had to grow up a bit before I could understand this music.However, once I was able to ""hear"" this music, it resonated within me, and touched me deeply like few music is able to.Santana's guitar work is, as is usually the case, passionate and flawless. But even more so on this recording. His tone, phrasing, all marvelous. Alice Coltrane's part in this as harpist, composer / arranger, and keyboardist is the work of a master musician by any standards. From the lush chords, harp work, and string arrangements that sweep through much of the album, to her Hendrix inspired howls and shrieks of joy on the organ in ""Angel of Sunlight"" are astonishing.I cannot imagine - and refuse to allow - my CD collection without this one."
5,Excellent Horsemanship Book,"I make my living training and riding horses. I have read most every modern horse training book and many of the ancient books and this book is by far the best and most useful training book I have ever read. No psychobabble, mysticism, horse whispering, American or Australian hillbilly folklore, or any other scams or nonsense. This book can teach you horse training skills based upon science that will serve you and your horses very well."
1,NO!!,"Nobody should EVER buy ANY gas range from Avanti. They simply don't work. In particular, the oven will not light and stay lit. Just call any servicer who services Avanti gas ranges, and they will confirm this.

5,Essential Anatomy Dissector: Following Grant's Method,"This was exactly what was promised as far as condition- very good, and thanks to the speedy shipping, I got it in plenty of time for class to start."
2,average,I read this book many years ago. Its ok but the author shoots himself early on. He said he taught spirituality for years then realised it was all wrong. Maybe this new teaching is all wrong too. Hardly inspring.Its a play on words throughout. As I said its ok. Its fun. But just more intellectual games.
2,Absolutely not necessary,"The book is clumsily written; whatever interest I had in his message was lost along the way. Don't waste your money. And whatever you do, don't buy an audiotape, unless you're into inept, boring mumblings and meanderings.There are much better books out there with essentially similar messages -- Tony Parsons's As It Is, for one."
3,Air Filter HWP20254 NOT MERV 11 it's MERV 8,"This generic Honeywell - air Filter HWP20254 which was originally purchased from amazon - ""Synfil Technologies"" was shipped from the company ""Glasfloss"". Glasfloss has a PDF file located on the following link that you can read to see the specs for all their filters.Go to: [...]; select the PDF file and go to the bottom of the PDF file to see the MERV rating for the generic Honeywell HWP20254 replacement air filter (MERV 8)My shipment came from glasfloss not ""Synfil Technologies"". I bought them because they were supposed to be MERV 11 and the PDF file clearly shows that they are MERV 8. Since I didn't receive what I wanted I won't buy from these company's again.Link to glasfloss: [...]"
3,Does the Job,"I usually pay $45/filter when I buy the Honeywell filters through the dealer that services my furnace, so $121 for a box of 5 generic filters is a good deal. These filters, however, are very cheaply made and the cardboard framework that crisscrosses the face of the filter is loose and a bit warped on all of them, making it difficult to insert the filter into the air handler of my Carrier furnace (I will probably have to rip the filter apart to some extent when I remove it). That said, I expect these filters to do the job. They arrived promptly after I ordered them."
3,Decent Read,"There is some interesting information inside of the book, but there are parts that can drag on or seem out of place."
4,Lots of interesting history,"The author did deep research into the immigration history of the upper mississippi valley (Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota) about the upper european immigration from 1850 to 1890. If you had family who settled in that time, it will enlighten your impressions of your ancestors. Be prepared for a tough academic read though."
5,"Good cleaning pellets, but not to be shot through gun.","These pellets do a good job. My gun manual said to NOT shoot them through the barrel - they are too light and inadequate back pressure may harm the air rifle.I put in from the breech, one at a time, and SLOWLY push them down the barrel with my 177 cleaning rod and I keep doing it until the last one comes out clean.I also have a pack of .22 RWS cleaning pellets for my TF89 and they do good, too.BLTefft in Columbus, Ga."
3,Does the job but lower the price!,Bought a gun cleaning rod also for my Gama Hornet air rifle and used a couple pellets shoved down the barrel. They came out almost black so I preceded to put a couple more down it. ... After a total of 6 pellets they finally looked clean enough for me to be satisfied. This box is very small but appears to be larger on the page. The box of pellets it about 1 1/2 inched by 2 inches and about 1/2 deep. Wish they cost about $4 to $5 because seriously that's all they are worth since they are made of some type of felt. They do clean decently so it you need them buy them but check around. Find the cheapest place because even that isn't cheap enough.
5,Keep your gun clean and rust free,Well worth the cost. Especially if you have kids. If you want the rifle to last for ever keep it oiled and clean...
3,Felt Cleaning Wads,"The jury is out on these. I have to do some emailing to get the lowdown from more users and repair people. Somehow these light weight wads just do not seem to be the most efficient way to clean an air rifle bore, and they may be too light to be safe in a high velocity spring gun. Maybe fir pneumatics...but I am going to be cautious."
4,cleaning pellets,"for the most part I was happy with the cleaning pellets I bought and quite pleased with the prompt shipping. The only small negative would be that the pellets seemed to be just a bit loose in my barrel, they are doing the job so nothing horrid but could work a bit better maybe they are old stock and shrink a bit? at any rate I would buy them again."
4,Its whats expected,"Its 4 episodes of Backyardagins, just what it says. It is NOT A MOVIE. My son loves this show so I got him this for Christmas"
3,Not a Christmas Movie,"I bought this item without reading the back of the DVD Case. I thought I was buying a Backyardigan's Christmas Movie, but it is really just 3 Backyardigan shows(that have played on Nick Jr.) that we've already seen. My 3 yr old wasn't impressed."
5,Love it!,Another great Backyardigans dvd. My kids are getting older and they still like to watch them.Just not as often as they use to. But I still like to watch them with them too!
5,I have fallen in love with this musical........,"I think that this soundtack is wonderful and amazingly well made and well done. I've looked at other people's reviews, and a lot of people are saying that this soundtrack is not the one for them and are warning other people not to get it. I disagree and feel that the musical soundtrack is good too, but that this soundtrack is still as amazing and well preformed as ever. Mabye some of the artists could have put a little more energy into making this soundtrack, but that fact still would not prevent me from listening to this sountrack and still thinking it is truly amazing......."
2,Extra Tracks??,Extra tracks?? What extra tracks??? Same track listing as ther vinyl L.P. When it says extra tracks I would expect at least one bonus track. Very disappointed!
4,quick question,Why are ther 5 song less on this version then the other . Btw I was in Boston in a Navel hospital in the early 70's and saw this live.....was so kewl.
2,Hair original sound track,I guess there are a couple versions of this sound track. It's not the one I was looking for but it will do.
3,Not the Movie Soundtrack,"I thought this was the sound track from the movie staring Treat Williams. It is not. So kind of a mistake to download, but, still enjoyable even if I wanted to hear certain voices."
3,Is there an accurate list of the singers anywhere?,"I've been wondering who sings what song ever since the LP's first came out. Is there an accurate list of the singers anywhere? I especially would like to know whose voice was used for John Savage. Generally I thought that Hollywood bled a lot of the energy from the score, as it usually did when stage musicals were transferred to the screen."
2,It's not like the original........,"I should have known - if you want the original, then buy the original.This version has good music, I guess. I thought it would be ""better"".....I was wrong.I was SOOO disappointed. You see, I had the original LP and learned it all by heart. I cut my ""hippie teeth"" on it so to speak. So to hear it all jazzed up, put almost to disco beat in some songs, was extremely disappointing to me.Too smart too late. I will now get the ""real"" one I wanted.Kathleen in IL"
5,I can't stop listening to it,"I really like it. I like Aquarius and a whole bunch of others. There are songs on here I like better than the Original Broadway Cast Recording. Then there are some songs I like better from the OBC recording than this one. All in all I really like the CD. Some of my favs are Aquarius, I'm Black/Ain't Got no, My Conviction, Easy To Be hard (really like this version), Electric Blues, Black/White Boys, Abie Baby (I like what Nell Carter does to this song, it is different than the OBC), 3-5-0-0, What a Piece of Work is man, Good Morning Starshine, and Flesh Failures."
4,Some Great Early Starts!,"One of the only Broadway shows that turned out to be a better movie! One sees the early years of such stars as Treat Williams, Beverly DiAngelo, and Nell Carter. A phenominal array of some of the best songs from the disjointed play."
3,Disappointed.,"I found myself quite irritated with this CD. The music was adapted from its original 1960s rock (which can be heard on the excellent original cast recording) to a 1970s jazzy-symphonic, soft shoe beat. The problem is that HAIR losing much of its energy and meaning when its anger and edge are smoothed over. The lyrics are the same, but the songs sound like they are being performed for play in an elevator or as part of a lounge act. It is just not the same. And the HAIR on this CD is not the HAIR that has been loved and repeated for decades; rather, it is a freeze frame of a late 70s. If you happened to prefer the music, movement, and feel of late 70s to that of 60s, then this CD is for you; otherwise, go with the original.With that said, the version has one great feature that is available nowhere else: Cheryl Barnes performing ""Easy to be Hard."" It is amazing. Unfortunately, Barnes chose not to pursue a show business career, so this is the only place you will ever hear her lovely voice."
4,The recipient of this gift was very pleased,"I bought this as a gift, and they really liked it. If you liked the movie/ musical you will like this CD."
2,Disappointing,"I was trying to replace the album I had owned many years ago. This wasn't it. I just wanted the songs, without all the extra noise."
5,Hair CD,"I just received this item in my mailbox......it must have got ""LOST"" in the mail.......my name and adress were crossed out in black marker pen and so was the return address...........so I have a feeling someone was on vacation and it was at the bottom of their pile because the CD pastic case was broken and then some one must have thought nothing was in the envelope and blacked out both addresses.......and then there was a post-itnote on it that said ""Jim, please deliver to ---------address.Well, ifinally got it and haven't even had a chance to listen to it."
5,Time for a new edition of this!,"My copy of this great book is in a box somewhere, but I have a powerful hankerin' to read it again. New edition, please! This is the best distillation of Rucker's odd writing-- odd but wonderful. He's almost never without his tongue thrust firmly in his cheek in these stories, but the scientific and mathematical principles he's dealing with are thoroughly discussed and dissected. It's HARD to describe Rucker-- better to read some of his novels (Master of Space and Time, Wetware/Software/Freeware, The Sex Sphere, White Light, the Hollow Earth), all of which show a loose, easygoing style mixed with challenging theory-- kind of a cross between JD Salinger and Larry Niven. (But better than that sounds...) Anyway, Transreal! is a great collection of Rucker's short stories, many of which I remember well even 10 years later-- try out ""The 57th Franz Kafka"" and you'll see what I mean. If you find a reasonably-priced copy of this, leap!"
1,Stories Under Nails,"Was given good reviews on Sunday Morning. I threw it away it was so bad (and I like almost all music, from classics to country western)."
1,Impossible,"I can understand how people have different tastes. I can understand how people with no taste still have preferences. But I honestly cannot understand how ANYONE could like this.The music is like that of William Shatner, while the spoken word vocals reminded me of the narration that led into commercial breaks on the old Dukes of Hazzard TV show. This guy is a redneck in full self-parody mode, trying to be a beatnik.As I listened, my first instinct was to eject it from my car stereo and throw it out the window. Then I thought about giving it away, but I was afraid of insulting anyone I'd give it too. Out the window it went.I honestly believe any positive review must be coming from either Ben under an alias or a record company plant. It is impossible to like this garbage."
4,His only solo effort is just this side of classic,"As a member of the Moody Blues, John's songs are integral parts of the classic albums, where all band mates shone. However, when the Blues broke up (don't be mislead about the group being on hiatus - there was no such talk of regrouping at the time), their solo efforts, on the whole, fizzled, as if some of their creativity was stripped away or diluted.John fared second best (musically) of the group during their time apart with this above average album. But, even though I do enjoy each song, I'm left to wonder what these tracks might have been if they'd been produced with the talents of five instead of one. My rating of 4 means I like the album, still listen to it and recommend a purchase.Oh, you ask who fared best? Ray Thomas, hands down. Why his two solo albums are not available on CD is a horrendous crime."
3,Un-Natural Avenue. . .,"Perhaps the biggest problem with Natural Avenue is that it doesn't sound very natural. After four decades in one of rock's most successful bands, John Lodge without Justin Hayward sounds somehow incomplete. That's unfortunate, because there are four very palatable songs on this album; Natural Avenue, Summer Breeze, Carry Me (probably the highlight), and Street Cafe.John's solo effort shows that he is definitely the rocker of the Moody Blues, even though their influence is apparent in several of the cuts.To really enjoy Natural Avenue, the listener must eliminate any preconceptions or expectations. It's not the Moody Blues, it's not the Blue Jays and, if you give it half a chance, it's not half bad."
5,"An Extremely Talented Man, An Extremely Beautiful CD","John Lodge's Natural Avenue was quite ""natuarally"" beautiful. Of course! I expected that from John. After listening to the Moodies and being a fan for years, I have come to know that John's music comes straight from his heart with lyrics that can make you cry and is deep and emotional. This CD is unbelievable. The songs are just beautiful. The title song (""Natural Avenue""), I think, is good - but is my least fav. I LOVE every other track on the CD. Every last one of them. I always find myself close to tears by the time it's over. This CD deserves 5 stars, and I highly recommend it to anyone who asks."
1,simply awful,"I bought this album when it first came out on vinyl. it was awful then and is awful now. the lyrics are trite and shallow, the melodies are lackluster, the orchestration syrupy and John's vocals are atrocious. John is a fine writer of rock, a commendable bassist and a solid member of the MBs but as a solo act, especially trying to write ballads or love songs, a complete wash. SAVE YOUR MONEY. he and Justin should do another Blue Jays album. Its songs have worn quite well over the years."
2,Sounds like John wasn't really into it.,"This CD was not as good as I expected from one who wrote songs like Candle of Life, Just A Singer, etc. It sounded like John really wasn't into it and could care less what it sounded like. It also sounded like he was having problems with his voice. The only two good songs on this CD are Summer Breeze and Carry Me and even those are questionable."
5,A masterpiece,"John Lodge's ""Natural Avenue"" is really a masterpiece adn filled with emotional, poetic words and terrific harmonies. It's orchestrated in a beautiful way and contains some of the Moodies absolute best songs ever. To me it's among the Moodie's 2-3 best album and John is truly underestimated as a composer and as a singer. I rate this album as no more than a masterpiece. ""Carry me"" and ""Rainbow"" is two of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. I truly recommend this CD.Ulf Gisslen, Sweden"
3,Moodies Fan from the Beginning,"Although the CD may have been issued in 1997 I have the original Lp issued in 1977. The cover art is by none other than Roger Dean. I think your run of the mill Moody Blues fan would not care for this but a true Moodies fan would. I like a couple of the cuts but the rest are ok. I'm not a song writer nor a professional musician so I believe anyone who can write and make a record happen, hey, hats off!! I believe that the Moodies as a team have the magic that has given them the staying power after all these years. I think this album was an expression of Mr. Lodge going into the studio and laying down some tunes he wanted to do. His best efforts are clearly with his companions that make up the Moody Blues. I wish I had friends like that........."
2,NATURAL AVENUE HAS SOME POT-HOLES,"This first and only solo effort from John Lodge is far from the quality of his work with the Moody Blues.A prime problem is Lodge's vocal performance. He sounds strained and occasionally off-key. While the orchestral arrangements echo the Blues early albums, other instrumentation seems superfluous and obtrusive. The most enjoyable tracks are CARRY ME, SUMMER BREEZE, NATURAL AVENUE and SUMMER BREEZE.Lodge seems to work better with co-Moody songwriter Justin Hayward, both in composing and performing.Ultimately, NATURAL AVENUE is mainly an album for Moody Blues collectors."
2,Only for diehard MB fans,"For the most part, John's Moody Blues songs work best with the full harmonies of the group to the fore (""Ride My See-Saw"", ""I'm Just a Singer"", etc.). His rather thin, high voice is not strong enough to carry an entire album and gets really annoying after awhile. And the overdubbed orchestration tends to be quite overbearing (although not nearly as bad as on Ray Thomas' albums). However, this CD does contain one real classic in the powerful ballad ""Say You Love Me"", worth the price for hardcore fans, even if John kept rewriting it endlessly on subsequent Moodies releases (""Survival"", ""Nervous"", ""It May be a Fire"", etc.)Another problem with the new CD release is that it doesn't have the wonderfully surrealistic cover art and beautiful photography of the lyric sheet from the original LP, provided by Roger Dean of Yes fame. Overall review: only for the fan who has throughly explored the Moodies discography."
2,Pedi fix,Very disappointed as It wouldn't stay on. But I think for the time it stayed on it did help with my problem.
2,Did nothing to change crooked toe,Kept sliding off toe. Very hard to adjust tightness. Never did much to straighten toe. Podiatrist said it was a waste of moneyl
4,Same as podiatrist's solution,"This product is identical to the ""appliance"" that I was given by my podiatrist (at a cost of $160 for the visit!). I ordered 2 of them so that I am able to wash & dry one while wearing the other. This product holds the toe in a normal position making it more comfortable to wear a shoe. You must be careful not to tighten the strap too much so you don't cut off circulation. I find that putting a foam toe sleeve on under the strap alleviates the pressure."
5,Pedifix Toe Straightener #55,"Delivery was very quick, and I am very satified with the product. If you have hammer toe problems, give it a try."
2,Pedifix Toe Straightener,"Product stays put on my second toe only when sitting down and not moving. Once I start to walk, the toe straightener keeps slipping and my second toe starts to overlap."
3,Pedfix toe straightener #P55,"This did straighten out my middle toe, but only temporarily. After I took it off at the end of the day, the toe raised up again. It works as advertised, but crowded the toe box in my shoe so I stopped using it."
3,ok,"I liked it better than the toe trainer, but gave up on it quickly. To keep it from slipping off toe tightning it cut off blood floe or caused discomfort. worth a shot perhaps"
2,Save your money,This doesn't work at all. It is not strong enough to flatten the toes and hold them in place. It only causes pain.
5,Does the job,This is the second splint of this type that I have had. It straightens the offending toe while not interfering with comfort (in a loafer type shoe).
1,useless product,This product did not help my hammer toe at all. It is thin cheap material that does not stand up to the pressure of a hammer toes. This was a waste of money.
1,pitiful PediFix,"This is a very cheap product but probably it is similar to any competitor product. It just didn't seem to work for me and it also was poorly made, but again, maybe all these type products are disappointing. After wearing it twice, it fell apart and became worthless junk..."
3,Hammer toe,"This is a good product, but does not always correct the problem. A return visit to the foot Dr if your case is eventually not resolved."
2,Not so pleasant to use,"The description sounded great but the product was a disappointment. Instead of helping to straighten a hammer toe and relieve my discomfort, it irritated the toe and was quite uncomfortable to wear. It is possible that others with this condition may find that this product has helped them. However, I stopped using it after only one day."
2,Pedifix Toe Straightener,Pedifix Toe Straightener:It didnt stay on. I tried to leave it on at night but always came off. It didnt fit well inside the shoe either.
1,Horrible,"The most uncomfortable thing ever, would not recommend. It hurt my toe and was a bloody pain to put on."
1,"Don""t spend $","A total waste of your . Uncomfortable, bulky, doesn't stay put and too big to wear with shoes, I had the surgery instead of looking for more fixes."
3,Pedifix Toe Straightener,"Unfortunately I didn't find that this product straightened my hammer toe. It's comfortable enough to wear, but unless I pulled the elastic strap very tight (which made it uncomfortable to wear), it did not work as I had hoped it would."
5,The solution to your hammer toe,"This is a great and inexpensive way to keep your hammertoe straight. As other reviewers have stated, be careful not to tighten the strap too much, or you will block circulation to your toe. What I like about this is that you can wear this straightener under your socks, tights, or pantyhose, and with shoes as well. You might find that your smaller and tighter shoes might be uncomfortable with this device on, as your toes will now be properly aligned, but I find this a small inconvenience.I have had this device for less than a day, so I haven't had a chance to live with it for long. I am so impressed, however, that I've ordered 3 more: 1 for the hammertoe on the other foot, and another pair so I can wear one pair while laundering the other."
1,Does Not Work,"I hoped this item would help my crooked 4th toe. But it does not fit my toe, and is uncomfortable. There are no ""Pedifix Toe Straighteners"" for the 4th toe. I will not send it back as I will have to pay for shipping. I would not recommend it."
1,doesn't work,"The picture of the item on the foot model (who obviously does not have hammer toes) makes the product look like it would work, but it doesn't work. Hammer toes are tough customers and need a very strong corrective action. Even when you crank down on the over-the-toe piece of this contraption, it's not enough to hold the hammer toe straight. Plus, cranking down on it cuts off toe circulation...wished it worked, but it doesn't."
4,one toe works better than two,"I bought both, the one toe and the two toe. The one toe item works well, the two toe tends to slip off. Don't know if long term benefit is there or not. Can't hurt."
3,Not sure what I think!,"My hubby has a hammer toe and used this some. It didn't seem to perfectly help him, but he thinks it relieved it somewhat. We figured it may fit some people better than others depending on activity, etc. He walks alot at work so it shifted some on his toe. Also seemed to inhibit circulation some. He doesn't use it anymore."
2,Toe Straightener,This product did not work for me. It would not stay in place on the ball of the foot and the little strap that goes over the toe would not stay in place either. It was a waste of money for me. The product itself was well made.
3,Pedi fix toe straightener,"This toe straightener does what it promises, but is not comfortable or stable with sandals as the base moves around. It has enough strength to keep toe straight but the movement lets it slip and you need to keep adjusting it."
3,toe straightener,Just an OK product- Glad I didn't spend any more money than I did.Product was sent by mail in a small envelope so I don't know why it took so long to receive unless it's not a stock item.
2,Like running in a dream...,"This is another SLOW, DOOM type band (i.e. St. Vitus, Sleep, etc.) I bought it hoping it would sound like Sabbath. It does...Sabbath in slow motion. If you're looking for Sabbath type stuff, you can do better. If you like slow, sludge rock that seems to go on forever, this is for you."
3,"It's good, but not great...","Just got it and I'm not dissapointed, but an earlier reviewer nailed it. First two songs are great, but Wizards of Gore needed to stay on the demo tape and the live song, swear to god, was recorded by someone with what seems like a handheld recorder. You hear him, or someone close to him, yell ""YEAAAHH!!"" after the band announces the song. C'mon guys, you couldn't get a recording from the soundboard?"
3,Get this for the first two songs.,"The first two songs, Supercoven and Burnout, and fine examples of slow psychadelic doom. Very much in the vein of Come My Fanatics. The other song, Wizards of Gore, is bad in terms of sound quality and musicianship. It was recorded as a demo in 1993, and it shows. The other is a badly recorded live version of the title track of their first album. It's alright, but not great. Buy it for the first two tracks."
5,Yes!,"By far their best, they sucessfully rotate between wonderfuly snotty pop to distorted fast punk...they even almost go back to dance my dunce style with undumb and a redone version of allergic. Buy this."
4,really it is understanding Spain,"It is an excellent book that provides a new point of view for those interested in the wide history of Spain.The book does not give historical data on the facts of the history of Spain but on the circumstances which encouraged the Spaniards to act in a certain way or to accomplish certain not very well understood actions, like the colonization of America, the inquisition or the civil war.The demystification of certain believes widely spread, like the understandable Spanish People behavior.This Philosophy books teaches us a bout the importance of Spain in building up the western civilization and participation in the creation of Europe."
3,"A few highlights, but nothing special.","This book could have been quite a bit better had int included photographs with each recipe. There is a collection of very nice color plates of some dishes near the front of the book but that is not quite the same. A few recipes have line drawings which were moderately helpful but, again, photographs illustrating the various techniques would have been much preferred. It is the lack of photographs in particular that makes it difficult for me to recommend this as a good starting place for beginners and this is a pity because the recipes are, for most part, fairly simple, 'homey' dishes rather than the beautiful but daunting creations featured in some Japanese cookery books. Personally, I did not find a lot in this book to excite me but there are a few interesting little finds (such as the 'Soft Simmered Chicken Gizzards' Appetizer) that make me not sorry I bought it."
4,Helpful for beginning Japanese Cooking,This predominantly black & White book does have a few colorful albeit dated pictures in the front.Japanese-style food is always beautiful though and it gives you an idea of the finished product.Throughout the book simple black and white drawings illustrate various techniques used to prepare a myriad of recipes.Simple instructions are easy to follow and there are many yummy recipes.A good book for beginners.
4,Both home cooking and party cooking in one place,"This one is somewhere between home cooking and party cooking, with some recipes for each type. It also includes a section with menus in the back, describing which recipes to cook together for a yakitori party, several different scales of sushi party, a tempura party, a teppan/mixed grill party, and so forth.If you're looking for a book that hits both everyday home cooking and fancier home entertaining, this is a good book for it. If you're looking for just home cooking, you may want to look for other books like Naomi Kijima's Bento Boxes. (Full disclosure: I've semiprofessionally taught Japanese cooking classes.)"
4,excellent photos of Germany,"With this calendar, I'm sure that I won't mind the passage of time. These photos aren't stunning, but they're incredibly pretty and certainly remind me of the places I've visited (or have yet to visit). Nor are they centered in just one region of Germany.Among the photos are Dresden's Theaterplatz, Sachen; Burg Eltz, on the Mosel; Bamberg; Heidelberg; Isle of Rugen; Meersburg on Bodensee (Lake Constance); the church in Cologne; the town of Schwabish Hall; a countryside lane in Reinhards Wald, Hessen; Reinhardwald (town); Berlin downtown; Fuerstenzug in Dresden; and the Zwinger, Dresden.It also is nice as a calendar, listing holidays around the world. If you're so inspired, next June you can celebrate the Queen's birthday in NZ, memorial day in Korea, Shavuot (Jewish holiday), and Flag Day (US). It also lists the new moon, equinox, etc., which may resolve marital disputes in your house as well."
4,Great Gift,"I bought these earrings for my Stepmother in Seattle, so I never actually saw them. Now she is a refined person with classy taste, so you can't just get her any piece of junk. She said they were perfect and she loved them. That's a great recommendation!"
5,Beautiful and super comfortable!,I love these earrings! They are really beautiful and super-duper comfortable! The look great on and don't get in the way when I am on the telephone!
2,A very disappointing read,"This book might help a beginner, but I mean REALLY, anyone who uses web applications on a regular basis and pays attention to the details, already knows this stuff. There are many other books that do a much better job at explaining the fine details and standards of interface design. My other problem with this book, is that it reads like a boring text book. I had to fight to keep from falling asleep! Unlike, ""Information Architecture for the world wide web"", a GREAT book from O'reilly that presents real world design problems & solutions, ""Designing Interfaces"" seemed like it was written by a non-designer, or ""text book"" designer, with very little ""real world"" experience in visual user interface design. At the end of the day, the most important information to be gained from instructional design books is the shared experience of the designer that wrote it. This is far more helpful than a book of design patterns.Two thumbs down :-("
4,Wonderful UX Book,"If you're interested in UX at all, this is a great book to have. It's wonderful in two senses: You can read all of it briefly in a couple of hours to get the lay of the land, and then come back to really absorb the areas that particularly apply to what you're doing.If you're going to have to work with clients on interface design, or have done so, you know that it can often turn into a holy war over where to put buttons and what colors to use. Everyone knows best in that situation, and no one knows why they do. This book presents a pattern language for describing why a button should be where it is or a color should be what it is, which allows you to use theory and logic against managers and customers who have no real idea why they like things they way that they do."
2,practically useless,"This book may be helpful to people who have never used a computer before, but there's really very little new information here.Anyone using the web or just about any software has seen the basic UI elements discussed in the book and should be familiar enough with them to know how they work.The most irritating element of the book -- apart from the lack of useful information -- is the constant referring of sections later in the book. All too often one section will mention a method or a device that isn't described until a later chapter, making it very difficult to follow.Overall: just bad."
5,Visual examples for designing for Information Interchange,"This book is by far the best book that does for the User Interface world of computing what Edward R. Tufte's series of books does for the writer's of technical reports and their needs to present and represent many varied types of data and data interaction. Need to show the effects of miles marched, time required to cover terrain, and temperature on Napoleon's armies march on Moscow and show the number of troops he has left alive at every point along the journey? Tufte shows how the French engineer Charles Minard did so. ""Designing Interfaces"" does exactly the same thing by showing how various UI pioneers have done the same for the Man-Machine interface. Want to see which issues are getting the most reporting in Google News and how fast or slow those issues are fading from the landscape? Check out the marumishi ""Treemap"" described on page 205 of Designing Interfaces. Highly recommended."
2,Badly printed,"Don't know where the book has been printed, but I think that a book about design, with a lot of images used as reference, should avoid such errors like wrong offsets and dotted prints, making images sometimes unreadeable."
2,If you like baby food - this is for you,Good treatice on stating the obvious but light on meaningful detail and depth into particulars.
4,Designing Interfaces,"Designing Interfaces is a great book to get you started on the subject, wether you are a designer or a developer, this books will show you how important is to *design* you application.Concepts are presented as design patterns and they are intended to help you resovle real world problems, some knowledge of UI design is recommended but every patten is described and explained very well, the use of the ""Use When"", ""Why"" and ""How To"" sections will give you al the information you need to know to make a decision on the use of any specific solution.From web forms to destop application, this books will show you the right way to make the user's interaction experience as simple and intuitive as possible."
3,A good reference and prefab pattern library.,"I found this a bit shallow as a read-through textbook or handbook, but it should make a very useful reference and may serve well as a prefab pattern library. I think it will serve best for those working on web sites and web apps, though it also covers desktop apps."
2,Kindle Version Layout Is Terrible,"I bought the Kindle version of this book for the 'Kindle for PC' software, and while the content is probably good, the layout in this format is a nightmare. The sections are not obviously separated and it looks like one big run on sentence. Very disappointed given the price of even the Kindle version.In fact, if most books look like this on the Kindle, I won't be getting one."
4,This Is The Stuff,"If you weren't fortunate enough to catch these guys in the early 80's when they were ripping up dance joints all over Manhattan, this is the next best thing. Almost all originals, played with not a note to spare and recorded with a technique that consists of not much more than miking the amps, Rockabilly (revival or otherwise), doesn't get much better than this. Numbers like ""My Baby Can't Be Satisfied"" and ""New Girl Friend"" show up a lot of better-known bands.The disc may lack some of the electricity the Flyers had live but if it doesn't make you get up and dance it means you really don't like rock and roll or -- check your pulse -- you may be dead."
1,Horrible pill crusher,"Very poorly constructed. Difficult to get it to screw on straight, does not meet the pill with enough force to crush it. Threw it in the garbage."
1,Not what I expected,For the average user it may be ok. It does not play welll with other routers in the network.
5,Author of the new gay almanac Rainbow Handbook Hawai`i,I think Andrew Collins did a good job of summarizing the scene in each city listed. It's obviously the most thorough first-hand accounts of the nation's gay cities on the market.
4,A great general guide to places you might miss...,"I bought this book back in 2001 for a trip to New York. Not knowing anything about ""the city"", I needed some help. Along with this one, I purchased a few other guides focusing on gay oriented places in the U.S. and New York, but this one was far better. With it's insightful mini reviews of places shown in the guide, I got ALOT from this book. From places to stay, to places to see, it'll give you a great base to start with when trying to find nightlife, or otherwise, in ANY new city. I'm taking it back with me again to New York and to Seattle this time. But, be weary, as with any guide, places change, and what you read might not be as bad as it says it is, or it could be worse! Thanks for reading."
2,Lee shorts,"I purchased a pair of these shorts at a local dept. store and they fit great! but of course, when i went back to get another pair they didn't have any more, hence, my buying them online. the pair i ordered online did not fit the same way... they fit, but are not as comfortable and i don't understand why... also, would like to mention i also purchased a pair of docker shorts the same day i got the first pair, fit fine, ordered a pair of dockers online at the same time i ordered the lee's and they too did not fit like the first pair... now that this has happened with 2 different brands of shorts, i'll NOT buy them online anymore..."
1,Not even worth the low price!,"I had these boots for less than a year when the heal cracked at the base of the shoe. I thought these were very stylish, with such a great price. In the end I wish I just spent a little more money and got a quality boot. When I bought these I also purchased 2 other pairs of boots by Rampage and since then I have had the same quality experience: 3 pairs of boots, in the trash!"
3,This shoe is good enough.,I am usually a size 10 and I had to get a 9.5 and it fits perfect. I am 5'10 and the shoe comes right under my knee when it is not folded down. The picture makes it look much taller. I love the detail in the back towards the top and the way the toe is shaped. I give this shoe 3 stars because the right shoe was a ting darker than the left. Also It looks like this shoe has either been handled a lot by oily hands or they sprayed a Protestant over it. The color is kind of darker in some places. I decided to keep these shoes because they are so dark you can't really tell. Over all an ok boot.
2,Not a good buy,"These boots are not knee length and have no zipper, which made it really hard to put on. I didn't like it at all and ended up returning the item."
2,Boots,If you are looking for a boot that doesn't zip on the side then this is the boot for you. Very hard to get on.
2,Bronner boot review,"I usually shop for everything on Amazon, but just got these boots from Macy's at an online sale that brought down the price temporarily. I am a size 8-8 1/2 so I went a size up to accommodate socks. After trying them on I would say they run slightly big or are very true to size so I should have taken an 8 1/2 instead of 9 but it's okay. Comfort level seems okay, should handle shopping trips okay. I will however attach heel cushion adhesives to prevent painful rubbing/friction. My main gripe is the boot shaft. For one, the shaft construction looks a bit cheap and sloppy in person. It slouches a lot and does not hold snug to my calf (i have an average slender calf.)The height barely passes mid-calf so if you are looking for a knee-length or tall boot this one may disappoint you as well. Overall, if I tried these in a store I probably would not have bought them and would have kept looking for something better."
1,Buy CAT TV Instead,"This is the first of 2 cat videos I bought. I was highly dissappointed. The quality was poor due to the ""home-made"" shaky movements of the camera. There was music in the background drowning out the birds and anything else realistic that my cat would be interested in. I received CAT TV the next day and was relieved because it was what I wanted. I threw Kitty Safara away."
3,Much more silver than gold,"I was after a two-tone gold and silver chain, and the picture was just what I wanted. However, when you wear the necklace, the silver overwhelms the gold, and it appears that you a wearing just a silver chain. However, the quality is excellent, and the chain has a good weight to it when you wear it. I should have bought the 3mm chain instead of the 4 mm, as you might see the gold better against a smaller silver link."
5,"Classic Aute, always soothing to listen to.","This is a stupendous album, one thing that never ceases to amaze me about Luis Eduardo is his very mellow and relaxed sounding voice. Segundos Fuera is no exception, I furthermore like this album in it's entirety. All the songs are good and like all if not most of his albums, listening to this one can be very efficacious to your overall health, especially if you get stressed out. Just listen to this album and see yourself feel like brand new."
5,Very handy for Baby Sign Language,"I am teaching my son sign language and he's been signing since around 6 months. This book is a wonderful, quick, go-to guide to look up signs, when he wants to know more. Also, you can't beat the price!"
5,The joy of signing: The new illustrated guide for mastering sign language and the manual alphabet,This book is very helpful as our grandson was born deaf and we are learning sign language as well as teaching him. Would recommend to anyone needing to learn sign language.
4,Miraphone for hard of hearing,"Great for hearing. Works with or without hearing aids. Good for bedside. Features are adequate, but identifying print is too small for old eyes, and many users of this equipment have failing eyesight also. Features are not easy to learn if you can't see the correct button. Also, backlighting the number buttons would be a help. However, primary intent of improved hearing is absolute."
4,Mirafone Review,"My 81 year old mother purchased a Mirafone from Big Lots for $10 a few years ago. She is losing her hearing and wanted a second Mirafone for a different location in her home. Unfortunately I couldn't find another Mirafone for $10 but after paying $100 for a Radio Shack phone designated as a hearing loss phone that was completly ineffective, the $29.99 price for the second Mirafone was acceptable. The features are very simple to use and my mother has no problem hearing me when I call and speak to her in a normal tone. However, when I am at her house, ""I"" am not comfortable using this phone; the bone vibrating feature is awkward and strange for someone who has normal hearing. I would without hesitation recommend this phone for someone who has a hearing problem."
3,"The book is okay, but that's it","I just bought my first Golden Retriever in March and promptly ran out to buy every book I could find on this wonderful breed. And read several more! This was my least favorite book on the subject. It has beautiful photography, no doubt, but not enough useful information on the breed. I had much better luck with other titles."
4,keepin it krakalatin,it haz some firme rolaz... turned out 2 b alot betta then what i expected... if u want some good sureño muzik commin out your speakerz... get thiz album... featurez otha low profile artistz on it azwell
5,Excellent and Enjoyable,"I think I have almost every advanced French CD out there. I listen to them in my car every day on my way to and from work. This program has been one of the most enjoyable, in a category with the Assimil CD but for different reasons. The Assimil program helps with comprehension and provides background in French culture. The Michel Thomas program takes what we have learned of the language, often by rote in traditional French courses, and makes sense out of it. The way the program is organized makes me feel like I'm actually taking a French class. I have learned new shortcuts in the language that allow me to speak more fluently because it all makes more sense to me. I should have known ""Ce qui n'est pas clair n'est pas franais."
5,"Premium Mint Tea, Really From Morocco","*****Moroccan Mint is a premium Numi tea. This herbal tea is certified organic and is kosher.On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: ""In the Moroccan spring, the snow melts off the Atlas Mountains, watering the plains below. As the days warm, some of the most soothing, refreshing and full-flavored mint flourishes in this ancient land of the Berbers. With a flavor as light and lively as a newly picked leaf, our choice organic mint will become your favorite mint teasan. An all-day or after-dinner delight, no wonder the Moroccans drink ten cups a day.""The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love mint teas, this is one that will not disappoint.*****"
2,Doesn't taste minty enough,"I purchased the Numi Mint tea yesterday ($4.99 - 18 bags at grocery store). It isn't as minty tasting as I expected for that price point. Don't get me wrong, it's a soothing tea (hot), but I was expecting a more robust flavor. I won't purchase this again."
5,A Really Useful Read-to-Me Book,"My daughters, ages 4.5 and 2.5 years old, really enjoyed this book. Cheerfully illustrated with text enclosed in easy-to-read boxes, this book is a must-read for new and seasoned Thomas fans. When the station roof is damaged during a storm, everyone pitches in to repair it. Everyone is useful! As a parent, I thought this book was ?useful? because: (1) it is a good introduction to readers who are not as familiar with Thomas and his friends, (2) children like my 2.5-year-old can identify with Henry the Green Engine?s fear of thunderstorms, (3) readers can cheer Thomas on as he searches for his missing friends Henry, Percy, and James, (4) parents can engage their children by asking questions, such as ?What was James supposed to fetch again?? The answer is lumber, bricks, and slate, (5) parents can also point out the bad behavior of the freight cars and stress the consequences of not doing what you are told."
4,A Good 'Thomas' book for Little Ones,"My two and a half year old daughter is just starting to get interested in Thomas and trains, so I looked for a book that would give some background information on Thomas and his friends. This is a pretty good introduction to the Sodor Island Railway and the Engines that are Thomas' best friends. The illustrations in this book are captivating, with enough of a mix of new and familiar to keep a small toddler engaged and curious. The story is very simple and each page has only a few sentences. My daughter loves this book and I am basically happy with it. However, if I had been writing this story, I would have included a little something in the beginning about Thomas doubting that he is really useful. His ""really useful""-ness is affirmed at the end when he saves the day, but this affirmation seems meaningless because the author never established uselessness as a problem for Thomas in the start of the story. An older child might feel the story is a little hollow."
5,Great book,"We first checked this book out of the library and my son LOVED it. When our time was up, I bought him a copy and it has continued to be a favorite."
4,Works for me,"I'm not sure if this helps as a weight loss supplement by itself. I don't believe that there is a silver bullet pill for that. I'm taking it along with more excersize and less food and have been gradually losing the pounds. It definately gives a burst of energy similar to an energy drink if not more, and dulls the appetite some. If I take one before running I actually have to be careful not to over do it and have poor recovery the next day. I sometimes have trouble sleeping after just one in the morning and can't imagine taking two a day as is recommended, but suppose we all have different metabolisms. The label says it has something like 800% of the daily recommended dose of B12 per tablet. You can do your own research, but 2 tablets per day over time will give you a lot of B12."
1,NO WAY !,"I were very dissapointed with this product. I have used two bottles,and have actually gained pounds. I am not leaner.This product have done nothing for me,but ad pounds.I would not recommend it.I will never buy this again!Don't waste your money."
5,An Indispensible book for all Polish Americans,"This is a book every Polish American should own. It brings together many of the top Polish American writers: Anthony Bukoski, Helen Degen Cohen, John Minczeski, Mark Pawlak, and so many others. The stories and poems here talk about every aspect of Polish American life, from the things we eat, to the way we pray, from the past we remember to the future we hope for.If you've ever asked yourself ""why aren't there Polish Americans writing about their experiences?"" Then you need to own this book."
1,Unfaithful to the Legend,"This story was not reminiscent to the Transformers mythos. Everyone acted completely out of character, and the story was not fun at all compared with the 80 issue Marvel run. Even though the artwork is spectacular, the writing is so bad that I still have to rate this book 1 star."
3,Mealticket - Misconceptions,"This CD takes me back to '94-'95. They were a good band to listen to on CD as well as to see live. The mix of horns, heavy guitars, ska rhythms, and funk bass make them distinctive to their time."
1,cheap reprint,"I knew this was going to be a cheap reprint, but not this cheap. Do yourself a favor and go to the library and just photocopy the 12 pages."
4,Law310,The book was in excellent shape. Even thought is the previous edition not the current is still good.
1,Bordee Book,Wrong item received - 2nd edition instead of 9th edition of the book ordered. Bordee Books gave me a difficult time resolving the matter.
5,Law book,Received the book in time for the first day of class. Was please with service and the book was in condition that was stated. Will buy from this vendor again.
3,the review of Slaughter at Halbe,I thought the book was in teresting . i found at first was the russia part boring about where every body was on stalin team. i like story about the individual conquest. plus alot of history. how history was made. For me
2,potentially fascinating story told in as boring a way as possible,"This should have been impossible to put down. Instead, it was hard to motivate myself to read it. The author goes through dull recitals of fact instead of making any evident attempt to tie the facts together into a narrative. I pride myself on finishing books I start, but I make an exception here. I'll add that the maps are poor enough to be entirely unhelpful."
1,Did Publisher Bother To Proofread Book?,"This review is not about the content of the book. I have still to try to read the book. This is review is about the quality of the publishing of this book.The publisher obviously never proofread what it was printing. From most paragraphs and most lines of the the book, the words have be randomly split, making it extremely hard to read. Examples are ""inv estors"", ""for tune"", ""inv olved"", ""w e"", etc. If I was Wiley, I would be embarrassed."
2,Book printing problem.,The content was very basic. Did not go into very much of portfolio management.The worst part is the lettering was off print by a letter. Example - The dog r an up the h ill.Watch out what you order from Amazon. They do not check the insides of the book. The publisher and Amazon shouldhave caught these lettering mistakes. Every Chapter was like this. Hard to read. I should have return it.
2,Misleading and sensational,"H. Millard has made a name for himself by opposing illegal immigration, and the virtually uncontrolled legal immigration we current enjoy in the U.S. As a result, he is often labelled a racist. ""The Outsider"" is a book that, according to its promotional materials, deals with race and race relations in a politically-incorrect fashion. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Millard exploits and sensationalizes racial issues, but in the end it turns out to be nothing more than posturing, and he provides an unsatisfying ending for his tale that seems to be crafted for no other reason than thumbing his nose at anyone who might be waiting to label him a racist (or even racialist). Therefore, rather than being a book about race and race relations, it is merely a second-rate story that uses low-grade racial situations as a hook to lure readers. It's difficult to imagine who might enjoy reading this book."
5,Guyley's Encyclodedia of Witches and Witchcraft,"Our Museum has a library of over 3000 books on the occult and witchcraft, Guiley's Encyclopdia of Witches and Witchcraft is the book most often used to point researchers in the right direction. The encyclopdia is without question the most useful reference book in our collection and we thoroughly recommend it. In this second edition Guiley has expanded and updated many entries and added new photograhhs. What a pleasure it is to hold a properly produced, weighty, hardback tome such as this. Well done Rosemary !"
1,Same 'Ol same 'Ol,"This book is the typical encyclopedia on Witchcraft, which is the problem. It mixes satanic elements and Christian concepts into the topic of witchcraft, which only serves to foster the negative stereotypes that modern witches/wiccans have to deal with in modern society. If that is the misinformation you're interested in, then by all means buy this book. But if you're looking for the perspective of those who actually practice modern witchcraft/wicca then try the Encyclopedia of Wicca and Witchcraft by Raven Grimassi."
5,Excelent,"It is a good web, where I can find, what I need. last order was shipped very fast, and books are very good. Thank you!!!"
3,addiction counseling review,"Addiction Counseling Review: Preparing for Comprehensive, Certification, and Licensing ExaminationsNot what I thought it would be; was looking for a book that encompased more 'mock exams' or 'practice tests' to work with. It does have a lot of information and I will definitely be using it to study for the test."
3,ESTOPA,"ESTOPA is the best at moment on Spanish Rock . Different kind of music , with an interesting mixture . If you like something new , you should try this one ."
5,A CLASSIC!!,"I love this Cd!! all the songs are excellent especially the first track and the one about los ""chichos"", I play this cd almost everyday at home and in my car."
2,Una porqueria,"Acabo de comprar este disco en Marbella, Espana. Le pedi al senor que trabajaba en la tienda que me recomendara algo nuevo de rock espanol. Lo que me dio fue este disco, y inmediatemente parecio que fuera la version espanola de los Backstreet Boys. El insistio que no, y le crei. Cuando toque el albon, la primera cosa que me ocurrio fue, los Backstreet Boys. Quiero decirles que, si buscan buena musica espanola, NO compren este disco. Es una porqueria de musica, y un gasto de dinero que no vale nada. Mejor probarse Melon Diesel, Fiel a la Vega o alguna cantante espanola como Monica Naranjo, Monica Molina o Rosario. Yo se que los aficionados jovenes de Estopa me daran comentos malos por escribir maldades sobre sus amores hermanos, pero si aun una persona me escucha los consejos, estoy contento."
3,Not graham flour,"Not what I wanted. I was looking for graham flour and was toldthat oat bran flour was the same thing. It's not, but that wasmy mistake."
5,Excellent professional resource,"The book ""Beyond Aphasia"" is highly recommended for speech-language pathologists and social workers working to address the socially disabling consequences of aphasia. Subtitled ""Therapies for Living with Communication Disability"", it provides speech-language pathologists and others with ideas and strategies for moving from traditional therapy towards restoration of identity and ultimately advocacy."
2,Coffee Table Book Indeed,"This book is attractively presented on high-gloss paper complete with photos of all 50 artists on the list. The ranking, however, makes absolutely no sense to me. It seems his ranking is based on one era of jazz piano, likely the era he grew up in, and I definately agree with the assertion below that retitles the book ""My Fifty Favorite"". If a novice of jazz was looking to learn more about the art form, not only would they be misled by the inaccurate ranking, they would find minimal biographical and stylistic information. It serves best as a great flip-through coffee table book for your guests."
3,Huge styx fan here,"Don't be fooled by the title ""Best of Styx."" It came out before most of us even heard of them. But it's a great Styx CD for those times when you've listened to the familiar stuff to death and still haven't quite had your fill of Styx. It is a nice cross section of their 1st four (largely ignored) albums. Dennis (Come Sail Away & Babe) DeYoung didn't sing a lot of songs back then. James (Miss America) Young was the more predominant lead singer, and Tommy Shaw was not yet in the band. They were as stylistically diverse then as now, but the production quality is a bit weak, as they were not yet self-produced. For huge fans like me it's just fascinating to hear how the early river flowed. This CD is the ""source"" of Styx."
5,underrated,I think the early music of styx is great . This album covers all there early stuff from 72-74 And I think the reason why nobody bought is because nobody promoted it as of also there first four albums. The name says it all best of styx.Tracks like you need love and best thing should have platinum sellers (except lady)which starting selling two years after its release.There guiter work is excellent on this album.My verdict is like I said before best of styx is the best of styx!!!
2,ou flag,"The flag is made of very thin material. It rapidly faded in the Florida sun. If you buy, keep it in the shade."
3,Good flag...Where's the plole?,The flag is actually just fine. The problem is that it is pictured with the garden flag pole as well and has no mention of it not being included. Not much I can do with a flag all by itself!
2,You don't really get what you pay for!,"First, let me start with the most important thing.... my son LOVED this costume! He's four and any four year-old boy with a Green Lantern costume is going to be happier than a pig in slop. He was thrilled and put it on immediately after he got it. I, however, was thouroughly disappointed in the costume, in that the green is more of a lime green then a hunter green and what makes the green lantern THE GREEN LANTERN is his power ring, it's a travesty that you have to purchase the ring seperately. At any rate he already has ""Flash"", ""Batman"" and now ""the Green Lantern"", so we'll get him a Superman and Aqua Man to round out the masculine portion of the justice league!"
5,Girl power,A very tough female detective with street smarts and a good sense of humor.Will read more by Katy Munger
