1,'Peoples' History?,"It certainly should not be called a peoples history, since we supposedly don't live in a communist country, where are views are given to us. Don't be deceived. It is a liberal, sickening book, as most history books are."
1,An easy book to put down,"The bottom line is that I threw the book away after I finished it. It was too factually incorrect and opinionated to keep as a reference. I couldn't, in good conscience, let someone else read it as a history book. So it's been worm food for eight years. At least the worms got something out of it. It's the first and only book I have thrown away based on my criticism. Shoot, I was having a good day until I remembered this trash. Do yourself a favor and check it out at your local library before your purchase, unfortunately it will be there. If you don't laugh or cry then feel free to buy it."
3,I got what I paid for...,"I was happy to receive this product at the price I got it for, but there was nothing in the description that it would be written in. Sometimes it is hard to read the original text and this makes it difficult for my classes. I got what I paid for."
1,This is NOT a history book,"I studied this book in college and it was simply loved by my communist professor who wanted to continue the revolution in the classroom. Zinn's book is not history, and the writer never intends it to be a book of history. As stated by others here, Zinn intended this book to bring a narrow perspective about American history, the perspective, or point of view, of events in America from those who aren't bourgeois, but are the poor, working class.In short, this book is Zinn's OPINION about American history and should really be classified as a fictional writing littered with some truth. If you are looking for a good book on American history, this isn't it."
4,A good attempt at a difficult subject,"Trying to condense the history of the United States into a paperback book is a daunting, if not impossible, challenge. Howard Zinn manages to pull off this feat by assuming that the reader already has a basic understanding of American History. This leads to some glossing over of topics, but the overall effort is a success. For sure, this is not the history that most of us learned in elementary school (Zinn is particularly harsh on the actions and attitudes of Colonial-era America), but chances are if you're reading this book you looking for a more mature, and possibly challenging, take on the subject."
3,Tedious Writing Style Hides Extraordinary Content,"I found this book to be, at times, outstanding. At other times, less than outstanding. Some chapters stand alone quite well as excellent sources of history, while other chapters tend to tread water. I found the author's writing style a bit hard to digest. This aspect of the book is my biggest complaint. After reading the book (from a library) I did decide to buy it because I feel certain chapters/passages will serve me well in the future as an educator."
5,Time to review what you think you know about history of U.S.,"This book is an ""eye-opener"". Think about what you learned in school about our history. Then set all that aside and read this book with an open mind. It's amazing what was left out of our history books and classes. This is a good read. It is easy to read and keeps the reader thoroughly involved. Everyone should take time to read it."
1,What A Rip Off!!,"The contents of this book are the union movement's history of the United States, which is fine and good. Somehow it was titled as the ""peoples"" history which is an entirely different thing, and sorely needs to be done. What misleading marketing! What a rip off!!"
1,Discredited and passe,Howard Zinn's time is past. Colleges and universities stopped using it long ago. The last bastion was the high schools but today's teachers know it for what it is and use it only sparingly as an example of how revisionist historians distort history.
1,Left Bias Point of View,"Professor Zinn has compiled a book of all the sad and dark moments in American History and has is in effect saying , this is the true & secret history of the United States. This book should be read by students because it is part of the history of America but it not THE history of the United States. Professor Zinn would not want my Cuban exile mother to write "" A People's History of the American Left "" or "" A People's History of Marxism "". I do not believe I have to explain why."
1,Socialist nonsense,"I bought this book to learn history. Turns out, the whole thing is just shallow socialist propaganda. Don't buy it. You'll be better off."
1,Revisionist Junk,"Nothing wrong with the book quality, the contents were revisionist krap. Threw the book away. Amazon provided a quality book, just the inside sucked."
1,Can't Trust or Believe in Him,"After reading that Howard Zinn does not think it is important to investigate 9/11, I will have nothing more to do with him. I don't care how renowned he is. If he doesn't think it's important to stop the false flag operations that have gone on for many, many decades that have thrust us into wars that were instigated by interested 3rd party investors to cash in on the vast fortunes made when they finance both sides of a war, then he will get no support from me. Wake up people! Aren't you tired of being played like a puppet on a string. Watch ""JFKII: The Bush Connection"" and ""Empire of the City: Ring of Power"" on YouTube.[....]"
1,"Terribly written, boring Marxist schlock","I have moderate political views, maybe even left of center. I had a long critique planned for this review, but why bother? The book was poorly written, biased, and tedious."
2,Forced myself to finish this book,"Book started off very interesting but I was left questioning the sources of the authors facts many times. Another big problem I have with this book is that it has a 'woe is me' theme against the US from the perspective of everyone else it seems. A history book should be unbias but this book leans far left, and I'm not associated with any political party."
5,"Go Ahead, Read It!","It has been said that Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" was not a book on how to do evil. It was a cleverly disguised book on how to spot evil. The ""Peoples History"" is actually a ""How To Course"" on exploiting people for fun and profit. Cleverly disguised as a history book of course. I'm serious. He tells a lot of truth as to how a lot of fortunes were and are made. Get to work! Zinn isn't poor. Take a hint."
2,Just a little biased?!,My son had to read this for his AP US History class and he has found it to be very biased. He found The Patriot's History of the US (Schweikart and Allen) to be a more balanced tome since Mr. Zinn would like to rewrite history in light of today's politically correct views.
1,Pure Leftist Propaganda,"This is nothing more that a revisionist attempt to rewrite American history as just another part of the ""glorious world communist revolution"" Pure unadulterated drivel."
5,Works Great in Spirit R/T's,"Ok, my car likes to eat O2, so it seams. But I need a high quality O2 sensor. After some research, everyone told me that Mopar ones are the best, but The Denso ones are what mopar uses, they just put them in their own boxes! But Buying the Denso ones are about half the cost of the mopar(boxed) ones! So I highly reccomend you give them a shot!"
5,Adorable Jeannie,"I never missed the T.V. show's reruns and now I'm not going to miss the doll. I always dreamed about it. I got surprised when I saw her! Her costume, her arms folded... Everything! She's wonderful!!"
4,A fine series begins,"Perfect for when you're sick of the typical and dreadfully pompous heroic fantasy that abounds today, Robert Asprin's Myth series is a tongue-in-cheek account of an apprentice magician's various misadventures and colourful friends and foes.Although I personally do not find it laugh-aloud funny (in the style, for instance, of Douglas Adams) there's plenty of sly jokes and double entendres hidden in the text, as well as some truly brilliant parodies of typical fantasy characters. And, interestingly for a humourous series, Robert Asprin takes the time to deliver some insight and warmth into the characters and their relationships, although less so in the earlier books.Robert Asprin is clearly a fan of Fritz Leiber, and Aahz and Skeeve do not disgrace their illustrious ancestors; Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser"
5,Great Fantasy,"This is the best fantasy series that I've ever read! It is light, funny, and unfortunatley going out of print. Buy all the books from an out of print dealer and you won't be disappointed!"
4,A Classic of Humorous Fantasy,"When the earth was young and Terry Pratchett not yet turning out another Diskworld novel every week, Robert Aspirin positioned himself to become the king of humorous fantasy stories with this book. Skeeve, a not-terribly-competent apprentice magician, falls in with an ostensibly ferocious demon, who happens to be an old friend of his recently murdered master, and his life becomes stranger by the moment. The book is a treasury of amusing scenes and clever quotations. Alas, the series goes quickly downhill, and none past the third are worth going out of your way to find, but this one is not to be missed."
4,Great series for all ages that can read!,The companions you will meet in this series of book will keep your imagination going for a long time. You feel you know each character personally
3,First in the series of Myth novels.,This novel is aimed at the late teen. It features plenty of double entendres and is generally easy reading
2,Another Fine Myth,"It was entertaining, but not outstanding.I would recommend this product to others looking for average entertainment."
4,funny without being stupid,Fun fantasy humor. It's hard to read this book and not grin like an idiot the whole way through. The settings the adventurers find themselves in on their quest are as funny as any I've read before. Very funny without being stupid.
5,"A Great adventure, from Klah to Deva.",This was one of the best books by Robert Asprin that I have ever read. It was both exciting and funny. An overall great book
2,Okay Stroller,"I like it because it folds up nicely and is very lightweight compared to other doubles... The things I HATE HATE HATE about it are that the seats dont sit up all the way and that you cant go for walks outside with it.. Basically, anywhere where there is a sidewalk, or any type of crack to go over, you have to basically PICK UP THE STROLLER to keep going... Its horrible. I had my husband take it back to the store and we are spending the extra money and getting the Peg."
2,RETURNED THE STROLLER AFTER TWO DAYS.,"THIS STROLLER SEEMS LIKE IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT. BUT NO.CONS..... THE SEATS DO NOT SIT UP ALL THE WAY. MY 2 YR. OLD COULDN'T STAND IT. MY 9 MO. OLD LOOKED COMFY....BUT BECAUSE OF THE SEAT NOT SITTING UP ALL THE WAY..SHE WAS SLIDING DOWN. SO WAS MY 2 YR. OLD. THE FOOT REST WERE IN A BAD SPOT. (WAY TOO HIGH) MY SONS FEET JUST HUNG THERE. THE BASKETS ARE REALLY SMALL. NO SNACK TRAYS(...AND I THINK SNACKS ARE A LIFE SAVER AT THE STORE.) THE BUCKLES ARE REALLY REALLY HARD TO OPEN.THE ONLY PROS....LIGHT WEIGHT, COMPACT FOLD, PRETTY EASY TO STEER,AND SEPRATE HOODS.**I USE A GRACO SIDE BY SIDE I GOT FROM A FRIEND. IT IS NICE. easy to push, seats sit up all the way. or lay back a the way. two huge baskets. ONLY CON.. NO SNACK TRAY AND ONLY ONE HOOD...BLOWS BACK WHEN IT IS WINDY.** (chicago)i think i'll fork over the extra $$ for the peg. : )"
5,Me gusta.,"Really good quality poster, better than the picture. I ordered it framed it looks awesome. Packaging was also really good."
3,Musher's Secret,"I haven't made up my mind on this product. It seems to help but my dog still picks up her paws as if they are hurting her (when she is on snow or ice and just cold ground). It seems to have toughened her pads but you must put it on everytime the dog goes out, which is a lot in my house. Oh well, can't expect perfection."
3,Mushers Secret,"I got this specifically because I was told it would help prevent my 15 year old dog from slipping on our hardwood floors. This did not happen , however she seems to like ie on her paws. It will probably protect her paws from the winter road chemicals."
5,Stopped the cracking paws,"Mushers is easy to apply and does not stain cured the cracked paw pads that my dog had,cant wait to see how it works in the snow"
5,Mushers secret - Great Dane approved!,"I purchased this to use for my Great Danes. We do an annual 5k run supporting breast cancer awareness and my Dane always ends up with sore, bloody, torn-up pads after running on the hot pavement. This year I put some of the Mushers Secret on him for the first time immediately before the run. His pads were 100% fine afterwards! Thank you so much for an amazing and easy to use product."
5,Amazing,"I just bought Mushers Secret for my 5 year old pit bull. She has always had dry paws but they never bothered her until recently. I live in Michigan and her paws have gotten so dry that she has been licking them until they bleed. I put a little of the Mushers Secret on today and waited ten minutes before I let her walk around. Its amazing, it soaks in and moisturizes deep in the pad. She hasn't licked her paws once since I used this."
4,It works,"My beagle loves to go on walks but the road salt in the winter really hurts his paws. I've tried boots but he wont wear them and the ones we've tried are too slippery anyways. I bought this based on the recomendations posted about this stuff. Well after 4 uses, I can say it does work. It's kind of messy to apply and my beagle isn't thrilled with me handling his paws but once I get it on (make sure you get in between the toes) road salt becomes a non issue. It would be nice if they made something a little easier to apply. Like maybe a spray or a dip. Otherwise I'd buy this again."
4,Does the job,We have had a pile of snow in upstate NY this winter allowing us to go cross country skiing with the pooch. This stuff allows her to stay out longer before snowball build up. It also seems the build up is less severe.
2,False claims,"This stuff softens pads which makes them less able to stand up to the cold, hard, and hot conditions that this product claims. It's just a waste of money unless you want to soften and moisturize your dog's pads but there are far cheaper alternatives if that's your goal."
2,be prepared to use often,"Someone recommended this product would protect and help prevent slippage on non carpeted floors.It may work some for protection, but be prepared to use it at least every couple of days.Did not aide in anti-slipping."
5,Caught between publishers,"A Chemical Prison is the title of this book in England and in Canada. When published in the United States, however, it became known as The Ottoman Cage: a Novel of Istanbul. Same book; same author. Read the reviews under the U.S. title. But don't buy both titles !"
2,Not up to par with the other Thoene series,"I was a HUGE fan of the Zion Covenant and Zion Chronicles series by the Thoenes, however after reading the first in this series, I am underwhelmed. This book has little of the suspense that so attracted me to the other series. It is also a painfully long read for it to only take place over 5 days. It is basically the long, drawn out saga of one small fight in Jerusalem after the British left. There simply isn't enough real content in this book. You could take out 75% of it and still get the gist."
2,light reading,"If you want another well written book by these authors...this is it. Having said that, I found this book to be a disappointment as I was looking for a compelling book retelling the story of the Israeli war of Independance. In this regard, this book is a light-weight when held up to the standard of O'Jerusalem. The characters are way too stereotypical...i was about to scream everytime the authors ended remarks made by jews with the yiddish word of ""nu"". Critics state that the authors,who are well known in Christian book circles, crossed over into mainstream writing. I for one, found a bit too much of their pedegree sprinkled throughout the storyline. I note that the reviewers who liked this book recommend other books by the authors as opposed to recommending other books about the subject matter. So, if you like the authors you will like this book; if your appetite is for the subject matter, you will be at least mildly disappointed...nu?"
5,Ommmm along for peace of mind,"10/18/2001-Ommmmm along for peace of mindBy Deirdre Donahue, USA TODAYThis autumn, our national psyche's Teflon shield has been severely scratched by terrorist attacks and anthrax headlines. We cannot change reality, so people need to find healthful ways to cope. For centuries, people around the world have found an inner calm through meditation.It seems easy. Just sit or lie down, close your eyes and clear your mind. Alas, taming those wild monkeys that jump around your mental tree is very difficult. This book and audio presentation explores the practice of meditation:* The One-Minute Meditator by David Nichol, M.D., and Bill Birchard (Perseus Press, and Audio Renaissance, 3 hours, abridged). Read by Nichol, the tape is fervent in describing the way training one's mind can decrease stress."
1,The One-Minute Meditator:Releiving Stress and Finding Meaning in Everyday Life,"I am terribly dissapionted! I had purchased a new tape recorder to listen to this audio-tape which I had just purchased...I had barely gone through the second side when the tape had got tangled in the tape heads...I attempted to untangle the tape...in doing so the tape heads got damaged and the tape had snapped. I am sad and angry feeling that there is no recourse for me or hope to get another tape without having to pay again...that is not fair! Could you please let me know if there is something that can be done? I would appreciate your response to this matter. Thank you sincerely, Martica Mary Kreze"
1,How's this for unique?,"Of all the albums, CDs and tapes I've purchased over the past 30 years, this is the only one I've ever burned."
2,Man on the Moon?,"Well I can only explain this record in terms that it isnt Lou Reed at all, but Andy Kaufman filling in... if that isnt the case then there is no excuse for the cracked voiced degradation of the songs that are remotely attempted as proper versions, and even less excuse for the alcoholic obnoxious degradation on display in the majority of this record. It doesnt even have the boldness of metal machine music, it is just plain bad..."
5,"There's two kinds of Lou, and this is both!","...I personally think that Lou's great because he can be at his very worst and very best at the VERY SAME TIME. Take No Prisoners is a prime example. Yes, Lou sounds wasted and cranky and not very interested in playing actual songs. He can't sing and doesn't even try most of the time. That said, he also puts in one of the smartest and most powerful performances I've ever heard, moving from ripping the critics a new one to dropping into a stone cold groove and ripping the roof right off the house and making it look easy. His backing band is awesome, and the production is A plus. A glorious mess. Oh man, if they would just release a box set with the full versions of the shows these songs (or parts of songs) came from sometime, I'd NEVER take it out of my CD player.""I do Lou Reed better than anyone,"" he says during Walk on the Wild Side. And then he proves it."
5,Read This,"If you are going to read a biography on the life of John Tyler, this is the one to read. Well research and well written, Chitwood does an excellent job of explaining the environment, politically and socially that develops the relevancy of John Tyler as governor, senator and President."
3,Decent Read,There is not much material available on John Tyler so this is about as good as it gets. The book is interesting if you know much about what was happening at the time during his Presidency. The chapters are a little disjoint but if anyone is looking to read a biography of John Tyler you are probably more than just a passive studier of history and probably will be able to understand much of what is going on during this time. I would not recommend this to someone that does not know much about history but if you really enjoy reading all that history has to offer this would be a good read for you.
4,"Very solid, entertaining book. A great read!","Out of the first 10 presidential biographies I have had the pleasure or reading, this book is in the top 2 or 3. Although it was written in the 1930's, the book kept me very interested and entertained.A great portion of the book is based on his presidency which is fantastic. Quite a few of the biographies I have read to date spend too little time on the presidency.If I had to ding this book with any negative commentary, it would be that the author sometimes makes some assumptions that I do not believe are completely warranted. Additionally, at times the author is extremely PRO Tyler. More so than perhaps he should have been.But, this is an easy read and has a lot to do with his political career. Not as much about his personal life, although there is some there.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about an obscure president and enjoy their reading experience."
3,Well-written but a bit overly complimentary.,"This is a fine biography in terms of providing a great deal of detail and factual information about the subject, but I can't help feeling that it is, perhaps, a bit too complimentary toward someone who was, after all, a slave-owner, defender of the institution of slavery, and in the end, vehement secessionist. Tyler may well have been a fine public servant and a fine man except for those flaws, but those flaws are just too much for me to overlook as thoroughly as Chitwood seems willing to do. Perhaps this is a result of his having writting this back in 1939; the world has changed a great deal since then, and there are doubtless few if any equally detailed biographies of Tyler written with a more modern outlook, so one may have to simply accept his tolerance for Tyler's flaws for what it is, but it does keep me from wholeheartedly recommending this biography."
3,Enjoyed the series.,"I did enjoy reading this series, I probably enjoyed the first couple of books best, but the conclusion was ok, if unremarkable."
5,Waiting for reprint,Well I have read the first trilogy and also the first two books in the druid home trilogy and am now waiting for Druid Queen and Ill be Happy
3,Can't wait for the reprint!,"I can't wait for this book to be reprinted! I really enjoyed the first two books of the Druidhome Trilogy, Prophet of Moonshae and The Coral Kingdom. But The Druid Queen has been out of print and I haven't actually been able to read it yet. It is a little frustrating reading two thirds of a trilogy and not getting......."
3,not bad,"I was bored one night because I had finished reading Robert Jordon's books, so I read Niles' series. The Darkwalker series was actually not too shaby. The Druidhome trilogy needed a little help but was still interesting reading."
1,Be Careful what your ordering.. Call first,"I bought what i thought was described in the description and the picture from ozbo. When it says ""Bitzenburger Machine And Tool Jig And Clamp"" you would think you get the ""and clamp"". So when it shows up at your door 8 days later and there is no clamp in the box don't say i did't warn you. Just be prepared to spend another 25 bucks and wait another week to get your arrows built. Just do yourself the favor and buy it from bass pro or cabelas, It will end up being alot less Hassle, Frustration, and Money. Stamp sucker on my forehead for trying to get a deal. The Jig does look nice though, i just need the clamp to try it out."
3,Dont be fooled by the picture,"The Fletcher is top of the line: probably the best I've every used. As for the rest: the description and the picture that accompanies and very deceptive. The picture shows 3 clamps and two inserts. It shows a package deal, that's why I opted to spend the extra $30.00 to order this product from Midwest marine. Other places on Amazon had it for $ 65.00 (I paid $95.00) Fact is you get one jig and one clamp. Don't be fooled as I was:"
1,greatly disappointed,"I just bought one of these. I thought it was top of the line, and paid over twice as much as the competitors tools. Well, when I tried to use it, I realized I needed a $25 attachment (a TM receiver) to fletch the arrows that I thought are pretty much standard, cock feather down, ie string lines up with one of the fletches.I'm returning this POS!!!!buyer beware!!"
1,Liars,"Exact same review that I read on here is that it didn't come with the clamp all though it clearly shows a clamp in the picture...I should of listened b/c a week later when the box arrived, no clamp! Do not buy from these people! Such a hassle and complete liars about what you are going to receive! Go to bass pro or cabelas and save yourself the B.S."
2,It worked for couple of years.,"I purchased this stud finder at Walmart for 5-6 bucks less in year 2000. It gave me rather good results and I was able to find studs behind sheetrock most of the time. It helped me to find around 10-12 studs. Just recently, I tried to use it and it gives me erronous, inconsistent results. Things did not improve when I installed new battery (original battery did not leak).Originally, this item would get 4 stars (even though 3.5 would be more appropriate) but now it is 2 star product to me.I will not buy any Stanley tools - anyway most of them are made in Taiwan and cost not much less than Craftsman tools made in the USA. They are other companies, which make tools in Taiwan and those tools cost less than Stanley (I am not talking about stuf finders but about hand tools in general)."
3,This is a tough one to review!!!,"Some movies baffle me.I want to like them,but something just won't let me embrace the entire work.MISS JULIE is one such film.While I found the actors outstanding in their performances, I was intensely aware that this was adapted from a play.It felt exactly like a play that maybe I would have enjoyed more sitting in a live theatre,able to sense the energy of other people.For me,some plays just simply do not adapt well to the screen.While I admired the unique camera work and Mike Figgis' attempt to film this work SOMETHING just did not work.Maybe in the hands of another director or opening up the film from that claustrophobic kitchen would make MISS JULIE more interesting to be viewed on a screen;but until that happens I feel that MISS JULIE needs to remain a play.Also,some of the dialogue gets so low that it practically becomes inaudible.I was constantly rewinding in order not to miss anything.That's frustrating!"
2,Disappointing,I was very disappointed by this movie (nothing against the seller; the DVD is perfect quality). I saw the play a few years ago and enjoyed it very much but this adaptation is not at all what I was expecting. A real shame.
1,rent it before you buy it,"I am an intelligent person who enjoys good period pieces, but this was not at all a good movie. I think part of the problem was that it was adapted from a play, and I prefer films that develop character like in novels. It was very slow and completely devoid of character development. Explanations of the characters' motivations were practically nonexistent and seemed rather arbitrary.While highly literary people might like this movie, I think anyone who enjoys a real story should avoid it. To be fair, though, the acting was good; my problem with the movie is entirely due to the material. If in doubt, rent it first to make sure you want to own it. Also don't buy it just for the alleged sex scene; you don't see anything exciting, and it made me cringe because it was essentially rape."
3,Living Loving Fade?,"The guitar player IS good. What is it with the endings? They end abruptly, as if they were going to fade it out but didn't do the fade out. I liked the CD, the disapointment being ""Stairway to Heaven"" (obnoxius jazz/lounge version) and ""All of My Love"" (instrumental, sounds more like a backing track in need of a singer). Songs are acoustic versions of the songs, mostly, if not all in the original keys (since Plant sang high anyway, the girls had no trouble hitting ""low"" notes). If you have a sense of humor, somewhere out in the abyss is a CD of sound-a-like groups doing Stairway to Heaven...not Zepellin sound-a-likes, but a variety like Beatles, B-52's and Doors sound-a-likes. The only criteria was they use the same words to Stairway to Heaven. (melody changed in most cases)"
1,Disappointing...,"Dear Readers,I would not recommend this book for manyreasons. One of the resons is the ending. I found the endingvery disappointing because the author had all the excitementbuild up, and then she let it all drop. She never told youwhat happened to the stallion! The stallion was animportant part of the book. I felt she was justwriting the book to get it over with. She wasn't writingthe book from her heart as she should have.Another reason I disliked the book wasbecause it appeared extremely negative and cruel. I didnot like this about her book at all.The only good thing I could say about the book wasthe wonderful illustrations done by Gloria Singer. Other thanher pictures, I think the book was one of the worst books I have ever read.Sincerely, Michelle Barbara O'Loughlin"
1,Disappointed,"I love the Guin Saga to death, and when I saw that there were CDs I thought I'd try one. I was expecting good music or at least some dialog. But it was all music and bad at that. It was grating and irritating and hardly music at all. For anyone who loves the books, you might want to pass on the CDs. Now I can't say what the other ones are like but if they are anything like this one...I'm afraid you might be disappointed."
1,Academic approach to paradoxes: scant advice for management.,"This academic book describes a number of apparent paradoxes in business that will be familiar to managers from junior supervisors upwards.It adopts an unashamedly academic approach to analysing these problems, and uses many charts and diagrams that will almost certainly catch on with management consultants in coming years. A good example is the chart that exaplains IT investment in terms of a matrix composed of Linkage, Reach, People and Time. This chart is interesting and has some relevance to problems in major academic research organisations and helth and safety organisations."
3,"Great sculpting, bad features","This is a pretty decent figure two-pack if you don't have any of the previous 12"" Vader or Maul figures. The Darth Vader figure looks excellent in the box (Kudos for face-sculpting; the likeness is dead-on) but once you take it out, you'll notice the vinyl clothes are too restrictive for joint movement (not very much poseability) and the helmet is too big. I think Hasbro could have spent a little more time tweaking the dimensions on the helmet (he rather looks like Dark Helmet from Space Balls). The Darth Maul looks great (face-sculpting, poseability) and is an absolute step-up from their previous figure (I love the grin) but do we really need the morbid, break-in-half feature? I can almost hear the poor Maul screaming ""Help me, help me!! Thou hath cleft me entwain!!"""
2,Wrong Part,This ended up being the wrong part. The pitch on the teeth was wrong for my Poulon Pro 295. More info on what this part will work in would be nice.
2,Not as useful as it sounds,"This book was useful to me in that the author explained his experience with raw foods. Outside of that, the ""chapters"" often consisted of 3 or 4 paragraphs filled with nothing but the author's opinions on scientific phenomenon. For instance, there is a ""chapter"" (ie 2 pages) about the biochemistry of the body, where the author says you can become ""cleaner"" and ""tighter"" on a cellular level by eating raw foods, but never explains what those words means (I suspect it's because he doesn't know). Half the book is an interview with Dr. Fred Bisci, which I found interesting. However, it showed that Matt hasn't written anything he didn't hear from this doctor, and it would have been a lot more useful to just read a book by Dr. Bisci. This book is not what it sounds like. And there are spelling errors. Quite a few."
1,THESE REVIEWS ARE FOR THE WRONG ITEM,THIS ITEM SHOULD BE THE SINGLE DISC OF 4 EPISODES OF THE 1985 TELEVISION REMAKE OF ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS. IT IS IN COLOR. THESE REVIEWS APPEAR TO BE FOR SOME MULTIDISC COMPILATION OF VERY EARLY HITCHCOCK FILMS IN B&W. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I ORDERED ONE OF THESE AND GOT THE LATTER AND SENT IT BACK TO SELLER. THERE IS SOME SCREWUP IN THE BARCODING OR SOMETHING BY AMAZON!
4,Not Small Town Baddies,"The Disposable Man was full of Mayor's concise descriptions and real characters. The plot was a little far fetched, but, after writing about all the crime in Vermont, perhaps the author needed a break from writing about small town and turned to outsiders. Russians and the CIA were a little out there, but overall I enjoyed reading the book. Joe Gunther, or the Vermont police, always manages to save the day. I will definitely read another book by this author."
2,Did Archer Mayor really write this book?,"Having read and enjoyed most of Mayor's earlier works, I was prepared to sit back and enjoy a good plot sited in a scenic part of New England. But this attempt to entertain fell far short of Mayor's past books. Hence the title review blurb. The plot and character development are convoluted and inane, and it seems to have been written more for a ""Die Hard -3"" audience than for readers who like a bit of credibility in their mystery novels. Come on, Archer, you can do better than this."
3,Suddenly heavyhanded Archer's arrow misses mark,"I had enjoyed several Mayor novels prior to this one: a sensitive and humble hero, nicely shaded supporting characters, multidimensional villains, complicated but carefully developed plotting. And framed by a lovingly drawn Vermont background.But I guess Archer decided he wants Arnold to someday play Joe Gunther on the silver screen because this one leaves all of the above behind. Instead we have an ever-widening and increasingly unbelievable web of FBI, CIA, Russian operatives and a hail of bullets.I think the reader from Maryland asks the right question: Did Archer Mayor really write this book?Say it isn't so, Archer."
4,Consistent Mayor fare...,"This latest entry in the Joe Gunther series is a worthy successor to the previous installments. Once again, the small town of Brattleboro, Vermont is in the midst of an unexplainable crime, and the locals are on the case, only this time it is Joe himself who comes under suspicion, and has to work to save his career and reputation. The story, tho' tinged with intrigue, is believable, and Mayor's depiction of small-town Vermont and its people is once again dead-on. Mayor is one of a few who have really crafted outstanding series based upon small-town law enforcement (others being Stephen Havill for New Mexico and Gerry Boyle for rural Maine). Good job!"
1,you get what you pay for,"I ordered the pack mainly for the ear piece. It was complete garbage. The casing surrounding the plug in port cracked apart the first time I tried to connect it to the phone. I was able to snap it back together. The sound quality was abysmal. It sounded like the person I was talking to was sitting in a cardboard box.The price of the entire package was cheaper than most single ear buds, so I thought it was a good deal, but obviously I got what I paid for. I will be purchasing a better ear piece this weekend."
3,Headset,The headset is not really good and the voice through it is not so clear as directly from the phone.
2,Racked With Errors,"This book has some good points. It provides interesting information about people involved with the Beatles.However, it is racked with glaring errors that are EMBARRASSING! The worst ones are as follows:1. George and Louise are listed as parents of the Harrison children. NOT TRUE! Harold and Louise were the senior Harrisons. George, the father of his own siblings? I DON'T THINK SO!2. George's year of birth was given as 1944 when he was born in 1943. His brother Peter's year of birth was given as 1943 when he was born in 1940!There is just no excuse for this kind of sloppy reporting. How this got past the editor's desk I'll never know."
3,Read it with a red pen,This is an extremely comprehensive book that is riddled with errors. For someone who knew the Beatles so well it's amazing how many mistakes there are. True Beatles fans will have a hard time resisting the urge to correct them.
4,Not a dry eye in the house,"John Donne wrote ""...any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind..."" So moved was Pamela S. Freni by the 1999 Texas A&M Bonfire tragedy that she decided to pen this book. Freni, a 1977 graduate of A&M, marvelously recreates the lives of the students lost as she buttresses her story with historical facts about the unique nature of Texas A&M. The work is a remarkable tribute not only to the dead and injured, but the rapid response by the university, concerned local citizens, Texans, alumni, politicians, and people from around the world. The goodness of the human spirit shines within these pages. And, although death does diminish us all, Freni's book, in sum, echoes the words of many of the grief-stricken parents who suffered the early demise of their sons and daughters -- grateful for the opportunity, however transient, of raising their progeny and watching them blossom as Aggies. Keep a box of tissues handy as you read."
5,Indigenous Eyes Only,Great book for perspective taking. This should be helpful for other country Indigenous folks to use as a tool for helping to grow and learn how to live in this world. Well done to the authors.
5,Great Book,If you want to get back to your indigenous roots and stand up for what is truly right and good this is the guide to get you started. It helps you put your thoughts into action.
4,Best of the genre,"I have no idea why this has been out of print for so long. Perhaps, ironically, its for political reasons, but, in my estimation, its the books nebulous treatment of ideology and party loyalty that makes it like no other novel. Should be paired as an answer to The Crucible for its treatment of mid-20th century political schematics. At very least, should actually be re-published."
5,"Great writing, super story, truly a classic.","Like many other people, I first read this American classic for high school civics. I've since reread it twice more, and it's worth it. ""Advise and Consent"" is a painless education in how the Congress works, and no wonder! Drury was a Capitol Hill reporter for many years (I believe he started in Truman's administration).Aside from his political knowledge, Drury's characters stay with you - they seem to be VERY real people. Action is, of course, laced with the 1950's modality, as well as the definite Cold War fears. Drury definitely deserved the Pulitzer Prize for this one!"
4,Excellent political fiction book,"One of the more enduring books of American literature, Advise and Consent appears to withstand the test of time. Well written, very gripping and a real page turner, it was no surprised that many people even today, would pick up this book to read. There was a movie based on this book which was also pretty good.This is however a first book in a series although it can be a stand alone book. I would probably recommended that since the series can be somewhat of a let down after a such a fine novel. Technically speaking, the series that follows Advise and Consent branched off to two separate direction. One direction leads the United States into ruins while other direction leads the United States into victory and renewal over our enemies. The situation can get pretty soap opera-like and after you are done, it also felt bit dated.Thus, I would recommended that you stick with this book alone and forget the series."
3,Easy to read...not meant to teach techniques.,"This book covers many stories and experiences. It is not an in depth teaching book in relation to 'how to' develop or practice your psychic ability. I found the title to be misleading. Great 'basic' book if you are looking to see if the psychic realm is somewhere you might be interested in. Did do two things for me....it helped in relieving a few fears and made me aware of the possible side effects of delving into the psychic world. Couldn't put it down, yet it left me unsatisfied and wanting more as my goal was to learn ""how to"". Barely touched on the ""how to's""."
3,Good beginners book,"This book teaches the beginner about psychic phenomena and how it can affect your every day life.I was mislead in the book's title in thinking this was more of a 'how to' book. In fact, the majority of the book tells the reader of Jeffrey's life experiences and in this I believe you can learn for yourself how to incorporate psychic power in your own life.Do not think you will get detailed lessons and exact instructions from this book. Although it does give brief lessons to practice on your own, they are in fact, brief and nothing more than simple basics. These lessons, or better said, recommendations can leave many unanswered questions that can leave the reader yearning for more....."
2,Similar books are better,"I read John Edwards' ""One Last Time"" before reading Jeffrey Wands' book, and there was no comparison. Neither one is a teaching book - but Edwards' wasn't meant to be. Wands' was. Instead, it was a demonstration of how good Wands thinks he is, but his stories weren't as interesting or as well-written as Edwards'. If you are looking for an instructional book, i would look elsewhere."
1,"Good Book, Bad Psychic","Even though this book goes through many of the basics of how to harness and recognize one's own psychic energy, the author himself is one person I find very questionable. I went to a reading where he was choosing the same people for each reading every time. When I asked him why he was doing that, he got quite unprofessional. Don't buy this book."
1,Broke within 6 months,"We purchased this product from Costco luckily because it broke within 6 months! The cold water was room temperature. It's great that it's energy efficient, but when you're working on something and have to wait a minute for the hot water to get hot, you forget about it as you go do something else while you're waiting. We're a three person office, and none of us wanted to get another vitapur cooler."
4,Step by Step Guide to your first ASP.NET 2.0 website,"Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Edition is a free IDE provided by Microsoft for beginners interested in learning Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 web development. This book, Wrox's ASP.NET 2.0 Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Edition Starter Kit is an excellent resource for this software and provides a firm foundation for a jump start. Both David Sussman and Alex Homer are authors known for their work for beginners. They've kept the tutorial spirit going in this book and provided some excellent walk through and build-from-scratch examples. Beside ASP.NET 2.0 and VWD, this book also discusses and elaborate on general application design fundamentals, for instance database design, normalization etc, and hence ideal for candidates with not much formal knowledge of subject but want to be exposed to the tools of the trade.If interested, you can read my detailed review of this book in the ASP.NET pro magazine."
2,not helpful,"it has an already made site which you study, but it does not go step by step, it just shows pieces of how this was done, and if you want yours to differ a little, you find no help to do so. Totaly annessecery book."
2,Poor Adhesive,"I bought these to stick to my photo albums, and they all fell off by the next morning after sticking them on. I am very disappointed. Great concept, but they need to stick!"
1,Awful taste,These dried mango chunks do not look or taste like mango. The chunks are a very light yellow color. They are sort of crystalized as if they had been processed with sugar; would probably work well in a fruitcake.
5,Just what I was looking for,The DVD was just what I was looking for and wanting. I was not disappointed in my purchase.
3,Skip to the good songs,"I bought this album for ""Year of the cat"" which is a really good song, but I never ended up getting into the other songs, so now I just skip to the good songs when I listen to this. If the price is cheap, then it's worth getting just for the few good songs, but be forewarned that you might not fall in love with the rest of the CD."
3,Contains full studio versions?,"Does anyone know if this new version of Al Stewart's Greatest Hits includes the FULL-LENGTH studio versions of ""Year Of The Cat"" ""Time Passages"" ""Song On The Radio"" and ""On The Border""???"
4,Al Stewart - excellent nostalgic buy,Brings back memories of my youth. A great selection of songs from Al with great value. Recommend it for its beautiful tunes and lyrics.
5,Al Stewart-Greatest Hits CD,"The Al Stewart Greatest Hits CD was excellent, containing all of Al Stewart's best songs. Listening to it brought back memories!"
5,"Excellent, from earliest to oldest",I truly love Al's music. I could only wish there were more songs on this CD!
3,Pleasant with impeccable pronunciation,"I've always enjoyed Al Stewart's occasional contributions to the radio and other than YEAR OF THE CAT and TIME PASSAGES I was not that familiar with his work. I always find a greatest hits a decent way to get an idea of an artist's other works. What I found was basically more of what I had heard on those two albums, pleasant vocals with perfect pronunciation, interesting guitar work with an occasional flamenco like flourish and songs that dealt with a variety of subjects from the historical ""Roads To Moscow"" to the romantic fantasy of ""Year of the Cat."" Stewart did have some topical range, but there is a mellow link to them all and this makes all the songs hummable but not necessarily memorable. This is probably all the Stewart I need for my collection but if you're a fan he's still out there recording new stuff not found on this package where the material stops in 1988."
1,Workout DVD is NOT included,"The product feature's state that foam cushioned handles and an exercise DVD would be included with the bands. The package I received contained only the three latex bands and a ""workout wall chart"". I called Amazon and they said they would send out a replacement and assured me that the handles and DVD would be included. I received the replacement today and it too did not include a DVD or handles."
3,Poor writing lets down a great story,"Dragon's Egg is a great hard sci-fi read. It contains a lot of great ideas. It has a really interesting story. It poses a lot of questions about humanity. It is evident that the author was a scientist.There is one problem though. The writing contained above flows more elegantly than that found within the book.A shame. If you can get past the incredibly clunky writing, it really is a good first contact novel."
2,"interesting science, but um...where's the storytelling?","I read Dragon's Egg years ago, when it first came out, and found the physics imaginative but the characters & plot laughable. A recent revisit did not at all change my first impressions (and the same applies to Forward's other books, like the Rocheworld books).I suspect that the other enthusiastic reviewers of Forward's works also think that ""Physics Review A"" articles have great character development, and ""American Journal of Physics"" is just Da Bomb!"
5,It's good.,"This is without out doubt one of the overall best books, I've read. Engrossing, meaningful and self-evaluative. And if you're just looking for mind candy, you'll still love it."
3,"Highly interesting, but woefully written","This is a great idea for a sci fi book. If we could get a real author to write it, we might have something.Forward is a terrible storyteller and an even worse writer. The editor of this book should have been fired. But still, the notion behind the idea is enthralling. I read the book eagerly and with great pleasure. If you can ignore the hidious writing and strange sense (or lack) of flow, this is a good book. If you are a lover of the language and the telling of a good story, run like mad."
2,The New Broadway Recording of Grease,I find this music too commercialized. The real flavor of the original Grease is lost to the bubblegum sound of the songs. I've listened quite a few times and I just can't get into it. The sound just doesn't have the edge of the Original Grease. And Rosie O'Donnell needed more time in the vocal studio working on singing vowels and supporting her breath. Buy the original!
5,Grease is the word...again...and again...and again.,"Everyone loves Grease, myself included. It's practically an American tradition. However, it's also one of the most overdone musicals. This CD added so much excitement to the show, and reminded me of why I loved Grease in the first place. (Before I saw it and heard it 900 times) Rosie O'Donell doesn't have the best voice in the world, but it's certainly charming and not even slightly painful. Susan Wood has a fabulous voice as Sandy. Some standout songs are ""Those Magic Changes"", ""Since I Don't Have You"", and ""Freddy My Love"". Marty is played and sung by Megan Mulally who many know from Will and Grace. Get this CD: if you love Rosie O'Donell or Megan Mulally, if you want to know the real version of Grease, or if you want an upbeat fun to listen to Broadway CD. Don't get this CD: if you aren't a musical lover and just like Grease, or if you are expecting an amazingly profound story."
1,not what i expected,This was not the version I wanted. My bad. I will probably just throw it away. The old version is the best!
4,Just wow!,"Wow after reading the bad reviews I was really suprized! I am producing a production of Grease and this recording was just what I was looking for! It's High energy is what makes it so fun! I especially like the reworking on Beauty School Dropout, and the Finale was amazing! My only problem was with Greased Lighnin' and Born to hand Jive, they wern't as fun as the were on the original cast album. Other then that I was smiling the whole time!"
2,What was I thinking???,"I don't know why I purchased this version - its awful! I thought I read the online reviews, but clearly I didn't. The singing is weak - sounds like a bunch of high school students - certainly not trained professional singers. (Actually, we attended a middle school production of Grease a few weeks ago, and those kids sounded better than this.) Many of the leads can't hold a tune! And the ""reworking, redesign and reorchestrating"" of the musical detracts from the original. It is less ""boppy"" and fun. I gave it 2 stars because the original music is so great - it has nothing to do with this recording. My advice: stay away!"
3,How could anyone give this recording 5 stars?,"O.K. First of all, this recording isn't that great. It's completely over the top, and not nessecarily in a good way...the singers' voices (w/the exception of a few) are completely spread and child-like. Susan Wood and Megan Mullally sound like chippettes for crying out loud! And the strange interpretation of the alma mater as ""we go together"" just makes no sense whatsoever. Furthermore, Ricky Paull Goldin just lacks the cool, suave essence of Danny Zuko. And the entire show is sooooo staccato, it's excessive. The show would probably be fun to watch, but as a recording, I don't recommend it. Unless you like the chipmunks, that is..."
3,A weak version,"This is a fairly unimpressive recording. But I don't know if it's the recordings fault or whoever decided to dumb down Grease. Songs have been removed, others inserted and the whole show just seems really silly and unimpressive. The lead vocals are ok, but some of the others (like Rosie O'Donnell) are a joke. If you're a die hard Grease fan then you might enjoy this CD, I myself don't care for it too much"
2,I've Got the Music in Me,Not that great. The only song that is good is the title name. Does not have all her hits. Has many songs I never heard of.
5,very informative,very good book lots of details and lots of intrigue into the soviet system of government and how just working for someone whos on the outs with the government can land you in jail
1,Bad description,"The book that I've just bought was described ""like new"". When I got it, half of the text of the book is underlined (I hate reading underlined books)!!You better don't rely on the seller description about the condition of the books."
5,Very informative,"I go this video for my father, who loved the special on TV so much he had to have it in DVD. It is really interesting and very informative. For anyone who works in law enforcement or special forces they will enjoy this special."
3,Informative and the last word on the subject.,"A book with interviews with american exploitation directors who worked during the 70's, 80's and 90's like Jim Wynorski, Fred Olen Ray, Paul Bartel, Sean Cunningham, Sam Raimi and Wes Craven. This book was written before the Scream trilogy so Craven isn't treated with that much respect, they claim that Sean Cunningham (Friday the 13th) have been more successful! Interesting look into the lowbudget direct-to-video business in the 80's. Some directors don't exactly seems to be proud over their work. Guess it must be hard for fans of a movie to hear that the director just did it for the money and that he himself unliked the film. I'm not exactly the biggest fan of these directors and their films so I guess those who are will find this book much better than me. But it's informative and the information about their work comes directly from the filmmakers themselves so I'll guess this book is the best source you can get on the subject."
4,pearly but not necessarily fancy,"I recommend this album to anyone who thinks it may be exciting to fall into an antique chest of some sort and discover a miniature band playing in the corner on instruments fashioned out of items from a sewing box. It is magically hodgepodge, sometimes delicate, and overall, it is great."
2,Dreamily well-written,"A middle-class girl tenatively befriends an unknown classmate when her old pals turn boy-crazy. Felice is a decidedly different friend; she collects dead animals for their bones (and a gruesome version of taximendary) and instead of a grumpy/pushy businessman pop has a detached intellectual single parent. When the girls find themselves summering on a farm ruled by mean-spirited troglodytes, Felice's capacity for cunning and boldness makes for an effective war. Neat, fantasy writing of a strangely perfect summer where the girls have zero supervision, have a deeply satisfying enemy in the brutish farm family, etc. My only quibble is the sterotyping. The heroine is mostly a one-note middle-class kid whose personality could be summed up by any arty/rebellious kids' book of the last 30 years - she's too inhibited. And the farm family is even worse, each member portrayed as a stupid, dull, hateful animal. Only Felice is given any depth."
3,Over All Decent Product,Bought from Wal-Mart.Cons:Clip on valve stem connector.Size.Price.Pros:Noisier and shakes more than company claims.On board air meter not very accurate.Conclusion:I usually top my tire pressure off twice a year so appears to be good for that. Not a fan of going to gas station because quite often as you go the the station the tires heat up and pressure might not be accurate. Was thinking of returning to store but then changed my mind. Cannot give longevity information because I have only used once.
3,Looks neat,"haven't used it yet, my grandson has and he says it works goodcan't think of seven more words to"
5,"If you love Austen and you love mysteries, this book of for you.",This book is well-written. The editor's notes are very helpful for those not already steeped in the period. This was a fun read. I'm now in the third of the series and thoroughly enjoying it.
4,Jane & unpleasantness at scarf rave manor,Having been a jane Austen fan for many years it has been enjoyable and refreshing to meet Jane in a different light. Good reading
3,Jane just ok,"This book was nothing great. It held my interest and I finished it but it was just ""OK"". Nothing great but nothing terrible either. I will still read the next one in the series."
2,Perhaps I'm Prejudice?,"This is one of two historical mysteries featuring real people that I have read (Seneca Falls Inheritance being the other) and perhaps I just don't enjoy the genre. Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor is contrived at best. There are far too many betooks and bethought me's (in one sentence, mind you!) for my taste. The real Jane Austen didn't write like that. It is missing the characteristic Jane voice that is sarcastic, feminist, judgemental and proper all at the same time. The footnotes and accuracies of Jane's life are interesting, but probably not interesting enough to make me pick up the second in the series. If you are a true Jane Austen fan, from Emma to Northanger Abbey, you'll probably read this book anyway, but I don't advise it. And if historical mysteries are your thing, it is probably worth your while. For everyone else, STAY AWAY!!!"
2,If Nancy Drew wore an empire gown...,"I was tickled by the idea of Jane Austen solving mysteries and I looked forward to the atmosphere I hoped Ms. Barron would create. I was mildly entertained throughout the novel, but felt I had read it before. A young, unmarried woman who has the respect of the most influential people, a villain who plays dress-up, the use of the word ""meddlesome"" -- yes, it's Nancy Drew meets Scooby Doo."
1,Bad,"Love Jane and you'll hate this book. Flowery prose, unlikely story, completey unsubtle in the development of characters, conversational comments. Boo hoo. Hoped to find something that I would love like I love Jane."
3,Fun Writing; Tedious Editing,"A fun read, written in a good faith attempt to imitate Jane Austen. But beware: those of you easily put off by copious footnotes which assume readers are complete idiots should probably pass."
2,Warning: Typographical errors abound!,"It's a fun book and enjoyable story. Unfortunately, the Kindle version has too many scanning errors, so it is difficult to read smoothly. For example the book often uses ""die"" for ""the"" and ""/"" (forward slash mark) instead of ""I."" It's annoying and takes the pleasure out of reading. So just a warning to those who might want to read this book: Don't get the Kindle version."
4,Rewarding and enjoyable,"I found this book more rewarding than my expectations for it. There was a genuinely intriguing plot with situations to arouse a high degree of sympathy for the plight of Jane's friend (accused of poisoning her husband). A nice touch was provided by the way in which the author inserted incidents which would have provided (were they true) inspiration for ideas and expressions actually used in Jane Austen's later novels. As usual with recent period mysteries, I found a bit of pandering to 1990's reader expectations (particularly the gory details)- but not as much as with many others, and not enough to ruin the overall effect. On the other hand, the description of the prison, gritty in detail as it was, seemed to ring true. All-in-all, very enjoyable and diverting."
4,Give your video of Emma a rest--read this! It's enjoyable!,"Now that my videos of Emma, Pride and Prejudice, and Persuasion are beginning to show signs of wear, I was delighted to discover this series of Jane Austen mysteries by Stephanie Barron. I opened the first in the series, Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor, with curiousity and a bit of trepidation. Who, after all, can really recapture Austen's superb sense of character and language?Stephanie Barron comes pretty close! She has obviously steeped herself in the language of Austen, and in the history of that period. As a result, she is able to craft a completely plausible mystery for Jane to solve.The only thing I didn't like was the author's decision to use footnotes to explain things in the text that we modern readers might miss. I found this VERY distracting, and finally learned to ignore them. I hope that in time Ms. Barron learns to explain the terms within the text and leaves off this practice."
4,Captures the spirit of Jane Austen perfectly.,"Stephanie Barron has created a delightful mystery series that captures the essence of Austen for a modern-day audience. Readers who know Jane Austen through only her novels (and not her letters, for example) may not always recognize Barron's sophisticated integration of fact with fiction, but anyone familiar with Austen's biography will surely enjoy the imagination and cleverness of this series. Mystery lovers and all but the most curmudgeonly of Austen fans will enjoy this well-written tale as well.The first in the series, this book introduces Jane-as-sleuth along with the cast of supporting characters. Barron is true to Austen's character and life (as much as we know of it, anyway) and has written a solid mystery also. Thoroughly enjoyable."
1,Spouts from a closed mind,"If you have ever watched CNN's ""Crossfire"", then you know about Paul Begala. He is the wildly fanatic liberal opposing the wildly fanatic conservative Tucker Carlson. As I see it, there is no point in reading this book. It falls under the category of unobjective political drivel. There are so many far right and far left books out there it is a wonder those who follow politics aren't going crazy trying to decipher who is telling the truth. I have a better idea, let's all stop reading ideologically driven junk like this and maybe they will stop writing this nonsense."
4,Just Stick to the Facts,The facts are glaring and quite numerous. But the slanderous tone really took away from those facts. I feel a book just listing the facts would a good read for people wishing to be informed. ... How about an independant study opposing the good and the bad? Then let the reader decide. ...
1,More of the same from the paid spinmeisters,"It is obvious that Begala and the Dems have chosen to not provide specific examples in the book, at least none that can be annotated. And Begala conveniently leaves out the fact that for the last two years of the Clinton Administration, the Dept of Commerce had been ""cooking the books"" on the economy, making it appear to be healthier than it was. Now that Bush is in, the books aren't being cooked, and thus the economy looks worse now."
1,More Hate From A Clinton stoge,"Paul Begala is the hate monger who claimed all the Americans living in the red (Bush) areas of the country were bigots, homophobes and Klansman. The only Klansman I know is the Democrats Robert Byrd. Avoid this trash."
1,Are you serious??,"I read this book to see the Left's side of the economy and how to correct it, and there is still no answer to EITHER ONE! Just more leftist rhetoric without facts...no need to read, just watch crossfire and listen to this idiot babble!"
1,Absolute Rubbish & Totally Flawed,Begala's job in the Clinton White House was mainly spin. More spin from Begala. Avoid.
4,Is We Learning Yet?,"I've read a few books on the history of G.W.Bush and cross-checked some of the facts I found in this book and found them to be accurate. I think it's advisable for voters to get educated about the facts like these, because if our young people are dying in a war that we could have solved with some patience and diplomacy instead we don't have any business being loyal to the war. Our troops yes, our president (who had to steal the election) NO. I found this book very informative and glad to have read it."
5,Debate Ammo,"This book is jam-packed with great statistical ammunition you can use to shut-down your republican friends. A companion for the well-prepared debator, this book covers all aspects of the Bush economic disaster, including (but not nearly limited to) the failure to mitigate the effects of a downward business cycle, his total disregard for fiscal discipline, Dubya & Cheney's crooked past dealings, and an analysis of what made the Clinton economy so strong. As Begala says: ""I'd rather my president be in bed with a young woman than with Enron.""Read & enjoy this great work. Begala has talent."
5,This Little Baby,"Nine years ago this was my son's favorite book. The first one was so worn, we had to buy another one. Now we have a daughter and she can't leave it alone either."
5,This book is a delight for babies and toddlers,There is no better review than the smile on my one-year old's face when she sees this book. The adorable pictures of familiar items are a wonderful vocabulary builder. I finally found it in Amazon.uk after trying to trace it here for a long time.
3,Helpful but not for a Beginner,"As a new student of Swedish, I bought the book and tapes as a suppliment to my course materials. The book is helpful, but not as easy to use the Ake Viberg grammar reference - which facilitates more rapid reference to grammar rules. The Holmes courses emphasis on everyday spoken Swedish is however welcome. I was very dissapointed in the tapes - the British narrator is quite dry and somewhat annoying with his constant ""listen to the speakaa"" phrases, and I was expecting more drilling on verb usage as opposed to just listening to conversations and reading. The tapes main function I guess seem to be to get the student used to hearing rapidly spoken Swedish."
2,Not so helpful,"The material gets across, but it is rather haphazardly organized; you learn how to say ""plastic handle"" long before learning any object pronouns. There seems to be an effort to translate new vocabulary as it is introduced, but this is not entirely successful; I found myself repeatedly having to look up words in the reading sections that were not included in the vocabulary lists following the readings. Also, the book makes the unwritten assumption that the reader is British, which produces surprisingly many inconveniences for an American reader. All things considered, one can certainly learn beginning Swedish from this book, but not in a particularly efficient or utile manner."
4,"They're CDs, and they're in Swedish","The audio quality is pretty good, and the talking speed is pretty fast for a beginner once you get to around the third chapter; this can be good or bad depending on your previous experience with language learning. It pretty much follows the accompanying book, so for a review of the content, check out the book's reviews."
3,"A good book, not so easy though","This is an excellent source... but only if you're a dedicated book worm. I tend to enjoy classroom style texts when it comes to self-instructed language learning. I'm only a beginner when it comes to Swedish, and this book is a little overwhelming without the instructional CDs/Tapes. I recommend you spend a little more, and get the newest edition, and if you're serious about tackling Swedish, go ahead and get the CDs."
4,"Awesome, Simply Awesome.","I have had this camera for 4 months now and love it. The quality of the video is superb with the Carl Zeiss lens and the super steady shot. The size is smaller than most digital still cameras. I have two complaints. One, when shooting video in low light situations the camera does not have night shot so you can barely see the subject. Second, Sony only sells tapes that lasts for one hour."
1,Not compatible with iMovie,"If you use iMovie your forced to use analog input. Why? Sony won't release the compression scheme to developers.If you have an Apple, skip MicroMV."
1,Stay away from micro mv,Micro MV is a sony proprietary format that they choose to no longer support. Must use their crappy software for editing and transfer and is not supported beyond XP and good luck with XP. Between Sony and Apple and their proprietary products and formats they both can forget my business. Picture quality is OK but so are most cams. The tapes are expensive and not available in stores.
4,Bigger than original Ludwig 11 a,"This is a great stick. I still have some original 1960's Ludwig 11A Joe Morello sticks, and the Pro-Mark are thicker, slightly longer, and have smaller, rounder tips."
4,Beautiful Voice,"This is a mixture CD with both pop songs and down right classics. It contains the duet with Andrea Bocelli, and if you own Romanza, you will never be able to listen to that version again. Segara has a voice of quality that I would compare with Celine Dion."
5,"Dead Man in Deptford, a great portrait of a maturing genius","Burgess out does himself with a wonderful and complex book on Christoper Marlowe. He uses the language of the time to paint a portait of Christopher Marlowe as young and arrogant. Then we watch as CM becomes more aware of the world and how cruel and arbitrary it can be to people.The beauty of the book is how it reveals CM's changes in understanding about the world. Everything is revealed by the Elizabethan dialog. As with most of Burgess's books, it's a bit dense and requires a lot concentration to translate the prose. But the effort needed to do that is paid back."
2,Did the reviewers quoted on the cover read it?- it is dull!,"While it may be historically accurate, it is one of the few books so dull I couldn't finish it. I guess if you like Marlowe's work you'd enjoy it more, for me it was evidence of why Marlowe is today quite obscure. A disappointment after Clockwork Orange and Earthly Powers"
3,ok,Was decent. I liked the super hero track on there. The rest was ok. Think Norm could have done better.
1,Horrendous!!!!!!!!!!!,I've been a huge Norm fan for years but this is just awful. I've seen Norm live and that's the kind of stuff I would like to see on a cd. This stuff is just so painfully bad it's hard to get through the whole thing.
1,i'll never get that time back,"Apparently this album was ""9 years in the making""i remember being in High School and hearing Norm was recording this album, and years later i was still wondering when it would ever come out.And it finally did, and it's so awful i can't believe it.i love Norm Macdonald, i think he is grossly underrated as a comic, but if there was a dictionary definition of ""Unfunny"", this album would be the picture right next to it."
2,This is for all the Gay people out there,"After seeing norm mcdonald in dirty works, I was dumb enough to think this might be good listening, boy was I wrong. IF your a happy camper and you know it, you will probaly like this one"
1,Disgusting!,Thought this CD would be funny after seeing it promoted on John Daily's Show. We tried everywhere to find it and finally found it on Amazon. What a letdown we had after finally receiving it and listening to it. This was a total waste of our money. It wasn't funny at all - would probably call it sick or stupid. Thought this guy was a comedian - he must be on his downhill slide. He isn't funny at all! Please don't waste your money on this one.
2,A hilarious comedian releases an awful comedy album,"I think Norm is one of the funniest people alive, but this album is a major misstep. I guess after trying a movie career and having TV shows canceled for virtually every network, the comedy album was one of the few unexplored career routes. I guess it is a good thing that Norm has recently put some effort into resurrecting his stand-up career, because this album of lame skits wasn't going to take him anywhere.The only reason I am giving this two stars is because there are a couple of funny moments, but those moments are not enough to make up for the hundreds of unfunny moments. In the two years since its release, I have listened to is maybe 4 times. Each time I have remembered why it had been so long since I had listened to it."
4,funny man,i am a big norm fan. and some of the reviews are not so great. but i really liked this album. there are one or two skits that could have been worked on harder. but tex hooper made me laugh so hard i cried. glade i bought it
2,Eponymously Titled.,"This CD is, in fact, ridiculous. I LOVE Norm and have been a fan for 10 years. I have always wondered why--and lamented that--he has never released a comedy album. So, when I saw this I thought great, finally a Norm album. Well, yes and no. This is Norm MacDonald and it is ostensibly comedy, but it is not a comedy album per se. This is NOT an album recorded at a performance of any of his stand-up routines. This is a collection of random audio skits which range from really funny to utterly terrible. I'm not sure why he chose to make this his first comedy CD. I listened to it once and I don't think I ever will again. Nothing memorable, and only a few good laughs. Please Norm, release some of those 90's stand-up gems on CD."
2,Anticipation followed by disappointment,"I loved Norm on SNL. I thought his fake news made him the best anchor they had (I like it dry!). But this CD left me shaking my head. A few funny parts here and there earns the 2 stars, but it seems like a handful of one-liners stretched way too far. I'd rather have a recording of him doing stand-up."
4,Too long,"A powerful story that could be 50 pages shorter. Ozick masterfully weaves her story of a disfunctional immigrant family in New York in 1935, yet it feels overwritten with unnecessary repetition that makes the story drag. In spite of the criticism, I felt it quite a compelling tale."
1,Victim of the Tedious World,"With so many positive reviews and spectacular title, I decided to give this book a chance. What a waste of my time. The characters are all so flawed that I couldn't find any sympathy or understanding for them. Nothing glimmers in this story. If it were a color it would be grey. If it were a car it would be a Ford Escort. If it were a TV show it would be cancelled."
2,No Story,"The first fifty pages of this book are interesting and absorbing--a host of seemingly fascinating characters and situations are introduced, and the author has beautiful prose.Unfortunately, this book has no plot, and failed to inspire any emotion whatsoever. It is a collection of miserable people who undergo no character development. Nothing happens, except that everyone is miserable. None of the characters are sympathetic--the reader cannot connect to them because they are pure creations of meaningless beautiful words, self-pity, and inexplicable neuroses. The narrator, eighteen year old Rose, fails to make an impression. She is so absolutely passive that she has no personality.So I could not recommend ""Heir to the Glimmering World"". It is pretentious, plotless, and uninspiring."
2,More hype than substance,"This was a long book about very little. The reader is expected to take a great deal on faith: the Bear Boy's neurosis, the mother's virtual psychosis, the family that lives in an improbable world of coincidence and luck. I have read other books by Ozick, most of which were masterful (The Shawl, The Puttermesser Papers, numerous short stories) but this book left me irritated. I couldn't stop reading it but it wished I had. The whole Karaite theme seemed almost irrelevant,although much had been made of Prof. Mitwisser's devotion to an extinct Jewish sect that denied interpretation of the Torah. Sadly, all I can say is, Big Deal."
2,"Flat, not glimmering","While the author does know how to construct an image-laden and sometimes beautiful sentence, the book lacks character depth and motivation. The premise is interesting, and I believe this could have been a great book if the story weren't shrouded in ornate sentence layered upon ornate sentence. Cumbersome read."
5,Outshines the vast majority of novels out there,"Heir To The Glimmering World will not be to all readers tastes, of that I am confident. Some will find it too erudite, for others the pacing too slow, and many will be frustrated by the healthy dose of German idiom spread throughout the story. If however you are reader that appreciates exquisitely written prose, and masterful character study, you have found your novel."
1,"Polyester, not silk!",I ordered this tie thinking I was going to get 100% silk. When it came - the label reads 100% polyester!! Don't buy it!
1,"Merchant sends wrong item, refuses to correct","I purchased a 100% silk tie, but the merchant sent a 100% microfiber tie. When I contacted the merchant, he apologized and said to keep the tie that he had sent and he would mail me the correct tie immediately. This never happened and when I contacted him again about the problem, he simple referred me to the original postal tracking that said that I had received the merchandise. Of course, I would never do business with this merchant again. By the way, the microfiber tie is OK, but it is not what I ordered."
4,Fuschia Solid Series Silk Tie,I received the tie before the actual promised date. I was matching the tie to wedding colors which made it hard to find. The fuschia tie was a perfect match. It was a good price for a quality tie. I would recommend this company to others.
3,Cute Movie,"This movie is a cute love story, though I can see why it was made for TV. Other than a brief appearance by Carmen Electra (thankfully brief), I thought the cast was well-chosen for this story line. It helps that Sean Patrick Flannery is adorable."
5,Great for cookies,This was a gift for someone who does a lot of baking.She is so thrilled with this product.
3,Marble Pastry Board,This marble pastry board is exactly what I expected to receive when I ordered it. It's worked out great for me so far.
3,"Just okay, could be a lot better","I'm not sure if the type of marble has any affect on the temperature, but I often feel like it could be a lot cooler. Sometimes I will stick it in the freezer before I use it if I need a really cool surface.Also, the plastic feet on the bottom are hard plastic, and the board slips around when I try to roll dough out on it. It would be better if there were no feet, or if they were rubber.I wouldn't buy this one again, but it will do for now."
1,not recommended,"I purchased this product and it was broken when received, the replacement was also cracked..will not recommend to purchase this product. it is thin and was not packaged properly on both occasions..i had to send them back still waiting for my refund..very disappointed..:("
1,Disappointment for the Nostalgic!,"""The Diggers"" was my absolute favorite book as a child, nearly 40 years ago. The main attraction was the pictures, obviously. So when I saw that it was back in print I wiped the tears of joy from my eyes and ordered it immediately. Imagine my disappointment when the book arrived, full of bland, boring, politically correct 1990s pop art!! The wonderful old two-tone sepia and green drawings in the original were dream-inspiring. Margaret Wise Brown is an old favorite but I wouldn't call her a master of the pen. Her books are dear to us because of the magical combinations of low-key narrative and old-fashioned art. Set to computer-generated modern graphic ..., the old manuscripts do nothing for me. BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL -- PLEASE!!! Thanks all."
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"Your opinion may differ, but I find the prose in this book to be terribly awkward. Various words rhyme on a page, but not with any set pattern, and thus the narrative ends up being stilted, with no good cadence. (Maybe if I read it 20 more times, I'll do a better job of anticipating the rhyming and cadence.) The story isn't terribly interesting, and it's also rather disjointed. Illustrations seem to be second-rate imitations of a 'heroic' art style from times past; definitely not the real thing. Some relatively famous names may be involved with this book, but there are much more enjoyable children's books out there. (Try ""Clickety Clack"", for example."""
3,lies and whispers,Perdictable plot but well directed. The music and soundtrack was excellent and followed the story beautifully.
4,Lies and Whispers,Great film dealing with many issues a person facing from the past. Gina plays so well with drama and guilt in this role.
4,GINA GERSHON IN NON-TEMPTRESS ROLE!,"The FABULOUS GINA GERSHON is usually stereotyped as some sort of sex/goddess,sex/temptress,but in this film she is finally given a role in which she is allowed to show her full range of acting skills,and she comes thru beautifully.GINA, in this tender love story set in post-communist Prague is vulnerable,sweet,tender and funny.For some reason, eight years later GINA is still NOT being used properly by the Hollywood executives.Rade Serbedzija is also excellant as GINAS' lover,his screnes with GINA are pure magic.I won't give away any of the plot,except to say the road to happiness for an American woman and Czech man is not easy.The DVD has exellent photography,but no extras-this is not acceptable"
2,Good storyline...slow,"Set in the Czech Republic, in the 1990's not long after the fall of Communism and the advent of democracy in that country.A pretty mediocre movie starring ...as a young American psychologist writer, and her romance with Jerzy , a former Czech dissident who is going up in the world.Things become when it is revealed that her grandfather was a Nazi architect, noted for his cruelty , who is remembered by Jerzy's father , a holocaust survivor.The storyline is interesting and the lead actor, ..., plays a powerful part as Jerzy ,and....is also a good actresses, but the film is very dragged out in many parts , and does not quite pull together."
3,Good fast paced ska.... but..,Nearly every song seems to be the same... and it gets tiresome after a while..... if you like fast paced ska you'll probably like this.
5,good listen from front to back,"I could sit there and listen to the whole album straight through. Excellent buy for ska fans! If you liked this album then you would also like ""turn the radio off"" by reel big fish."
5,Less Than Jake rules,"Ok well when i 1st heard this cd i was like o this is ok i guess. But then a week later i was bored so i put it in. I was blown away! This cd is sooo good it is really something new and fresh. The best song on here is automatic(a lot of people beg to differ but its my favorite) it just makes me feel so good i mean that song and Less Than Jake kept me from killing myself 3 times.The music is unbelieveable and just awesome, the lyrics are just so good i can relate to every song. Buy this cd you wont be disapointted i promise you need to here this! Less Than Jake is the best band ever!!!!"
2,This CD makes me upset,"Less Than Jake is my favorite band, but if this had been the first CD of them that I had ever listened to, I wouldve never realized just how sweet they are. Every other CD they have would get 5 stars from me."
1,ummm...Yuck,"somehow, I was awefully tricked into buying this album, but let me say this: it sucks. i cannot see how anyone,except perhaps some seventh grade kid, could like this. so, kick this to the curb and get some real music."
4,mmm...nice,"Hi! You may remember me from such reviews as ""Hello Rockview"" by Less Than Jake but today I'm here to talk about an earlier outing from said band. All I want to do here is to reiterate the other man's comments that Losing Streak is a great album, whether you are ""in"" to ska-punk or not. Less Than Jake rock, man!"
5,The Best. Period.,"The energy never stops on Losing Streak...It's a non stop party from start to finish. If you like ska and you don't have this album, you're missing a treat."
4,A very enjoyable title,"I think that Less Than Jake exhibits phenomenal brass workk in this album. In fact, i think it's there best in that regard. However, I don't give it five stars because the vocals are lacking in some songs and, in all honesty, can get annoying. But the intramentals really make up for it. The bass and ska guitar riffs are all catchy. But, like I said before, where this album shines is in its horns, as they create a really temendous sound unique to LTJ's sound. If you don't like traditional Ska, with it's blazng horns and fast beat rythum guitar, then you'll have a heard time getting into this CD. This is truely a CD for the lover of Ska not just ""rockers"", becuase they ultimately won't get it. I personally recomend this album for a the avid ska listener, and anyone who takes an interest in ska or skacore."
5,Best LTJ cd,"This is my favorite release by LTJ, their others just don't compare to this one. Every song is is fast past and high energy with a great horn section, I can always listen to it straight threw. The best song on here I think is 'Sugar in your gas tank'. It ... that their last album completely ..., but I will always love LTJ just because of this one CD. Just get this, you will be listening to it for years..."
5,Even Old Farts Like It!,"I'm 38, and for fun I asked my 18 year old nephew to lend me some of his many CDs. I'm trying to be hip, I told him. He deliberated carefully, and handed me Losing Streak by Less Than Jake, as well as discs by Catch 22 and Mustard Plug. I listened to all three. Then I kept listening to Losing Streak. I love it; it makes me move, laugh, and god help me, even sing along. My coworkers all hate it, as does my wife, but it's the best record I've listened to in years. Now if I could just work up the confidence to go to one of their concerts. Oh, and my nephew is never getting it back."
5,THIS CD RULES!,I LOVE THIS CD. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST FROM LESS THEN JAKE. I LOVE THIS BAND AND THIS CD IS THE BEST FROM THEM YET. EVERBODY WHO LIKES SKA SHOULD BUY THIS CD!
5,I LOVE THIS CD,"If I was stranded on a desert island and could only have 5 CDs . . . this would definitely be one of them! Get it! You need it! You want it! Then go see them live . . . its hard to tell who's having more fun. . . them, or the crowd!"
4,It's Lessthanjakealicious,yummy...i can't go more than a few weeks without listening to this cd. its like an unhealthy addiction. its so wrong but feels so right! all hail less than jake
4,LTJ,This cd is great. It has plenty of energy. It is a great testament to how ska and punk can be intertwined to form a greater sound.
1,Not for this planet,This item does not have one thread pitch compatable with any threads on this planet. The garden hose connection is incompatable with U.S. threads as are the tire valve adapters. This product is very well made but totally useless except as a paper weight. I gave it one star because I was not able to assign it a minus 1 star.
2,VARIETY OF AMERICAN TALES,"This 1960's anthology by Scholastic consists of ll short stories interspersed with poems and one non-fiction selection about international Christmas customs. The paperback format makes it portable and handy to slip into a book bag. All the stories are set in America and two are even autobiographical. My favorite is an excerpt from Little House on the Prairie, when Laura relates how the family friend, Mr. Edwards, met up with Santa in town and delivered some gifts to the Ingalls cabin for him. Best poem: The Golden Cobwebs, based on a Germanic legend. This is a short, easy read; it doesn't matter how often you are interrupted, for the yuletide season remains true and bright."
2,Too Much Focus on Upper Body,I honestly hated this dvd.I felt there was too much focus on the upper body & it gave me muscle spasms in my upper back & neck trying to follow along.I also felt that it wasn't truly geared to a pregnant woman's body - especially if you are the least bit out of shape before hand. A lot of the exercises I just couldn't do without a spotter to watch me and be there to help me.
3,Not good enough for soft and simply deco.,"I am quite disappointed with this book. Most colors used in the book are quite vivid and heavy. I have trouble finding the demonstration of nice and soft pastel colors. Also there isn't enough simply yet elegant themes.But it actually deserve a 3.5 if I could rate it that way. It has two pictures of real room for each theme and many color palette to show various combinations of main, accent and complementary colors."
3,"not bad, not good","With such stellar resources, you might expect this recording to be a knock-your-socks-off affair. Sadly, this is not so. My recommendation is lukewarm at best.The singers are uniformly excellent, except for Jones. Listening to her sing Senta is downright painful. She sinks the ship (both of them) all by her lonesome.The performance: you have live, you have Bayreuth 1971, you have Bohm, you have slow-ish tempi, and you have an opera of raw, elemental power. This seems to be a winning combination. However, the performance is oddly lackluster.In the end, I was not overly thrilled. I suggest you look elsewhere for the Flying Dutchman."
1,forgetable recording,"I bought this Dutchman for the price. Under $15. Thomas Stewart is a fine Dutchman, and the Bayreuth orchestra playing under Bohm is fine, but thats where the praise ends. Gwyneth Jones is a lousy Senta, with serious pitch problems in addition to being a lack lustre voice. Hermin Esser as Erik is at best hearable. In summary a very, very forgettable recording and not recommended."
5,Moog K6477 Lower Ball Joints were a direct replacement for my 1999 Chevy Tahoe,"These Moog K6477 Lower Ball Joints were a perfect fit direct replacement. There was no issues replacing these balljoints. One tip I will offer is 2 days prior to installing the balljoints, place them in the freezer until you are ready to press them into the control arm. It will make them press in much easier.. great product at a great price"
3,Don't Let The Title Fool You,"Only three stars just because of the misleading naming and incomplete description. This is not a continuation like the name implies, but more a best of. Includes episodes from volumes/seasons 1 through 3: Night Of The Dying, Love Lost, Mist Demeanor, A Nightmare On Jackson Street, Better Angels, Children Of The Fool, and A Jury Of His Fears"
1,Nephilim: The Fallen Ones,"So - so, although I only spent about $7.95 there are better books out there that you can spend your money on."
5,No better deal anywhere else,"I don't think i would ever have found such a great deal on these chips, very good quality, only 100 but good enough for my small craps games. has a nice clear platic case for them all and a nice graphic box with the Las Vegas sign on front. I ordered the diamond suited, the picture is pretty much the same except blue is replaced by black, but i like that much better."
3,Suited Poker Chips,"I received my poker chips promptly which was awesome, however the acrylic case in which they were contained was broken, which sucks. The chips for home play are awesome but the slipper texture may be a point of contention as it makes them difficult to shuffle or stack. Overall the product is a decent value and a good option to more expensive poker chips but if you have issues like I had with a broken case it sorely detracts from the product. They're decent."
4,Great Quality; A Bit Pricey for the Quantity,"The chips are really nice and have taken quite a beating without chipping from me. However, They are a tiny bit pricey for just a hundred chips. But, if the quantity is good for you and quality is important, you won't find a better deal on Amazon."
5,Like It !,"I own a Samsung I700 PDA-phone with all kinds of buttons on both sides of the PDA so most common bulkier PDA holders are less ideal. This Pharos PX004 comes with Velcros as well as A/C vent mounting kit. With the use of the supplied Velcro, the simple PDA holder works perfectly without the additional bulks of those clamps found on generic PDA holder. Suction cup is pretty much standard (with the locking mechanism or reinforcement found is most windshield mounted PDA holder) and the flexible goose neck is rigid enough to not deform with the weight of the PDA. Recommend it."
1,A big dissapoint,"I bought this video,thinking that this would be a the crow 3 with a new wonderful story. I could not have been more wrong.This is just a bad repeat of the brilliant first The crow video with Brandon.Lee. I was really dissapointed.It had lost all the dark mood and beautiful pictures and dialoges that the first movie had.This hasnt got that lovely depressing feeling that the two first movies have.Its 'to optimistic to be a Crow movie. Save your money!"
1,Not Even Halfway Up The Stairway And It Fails...,"Personally, from the fact that they ""borrowed"" Eric Draven spells disaster in my eyes. With the pilot being a b grade copy of the movie, it left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the series. Mark couldn't win me over with his portrayal, especially with his outfit inspired from the movie that I thought looked horrible, specifically the coat. As I have mentioned before in a review elsewhere, the only good things to come out of this that it showcased the moments for Eric and Shelly that possibly could have happened before their deaths and that Katie Stuart and Mark have had quite a few good roles since then:X2(for katie) and Brotherhood Of The Wolf/Cradle 2 The Grave(for Mark). The only way this concept will ever work again is with a fresh new character, on HBO. One piece of Trivia:The actors who played Skull Cowboy,Top Dollar and Eric Draven were all in ""Drive"" before this show.One star for when it originally entertained me."
2,A Plumiting Stairway,"The makers of this series don't seem to relise that the story of Eric Draven has been put on film and finished. They claim the Series is based on the Comic strip by James O'Barr but it appears that the have watched the film and neglected to eaven go out and buy the comic as it is full of old cleshays from the Brandon Lee film. This first episode is basicly the same story line as the first film except with bad actors who don't suite there rolls and don't fite the film or the comic. If you are a fan of the crow like I am go and buy it, it's got a new twist to the story of Eric and Shelly but it is still undoubtebly a cheep ripe of. Marc is terrible as Eric and if you see this before the film you will want to know what all the fuss is about. I suggest you get the film first then the sequell and then the comic and if you have any money left over then get this. All in all I guess it just isn't origanal enough, it would have been better with a whoule new story."
1,sk8ertrite,what's with all the crow copies.the originalwas the best and will alwaya be. in brandon lee's last on camera interview he said if he where to have the same death and abail to come back he would have done the same as to come back and kill every one. city of angels was ok but they went too with a third one and all the rest. i think it is pethetic to have a bunch of sucky ones when the first was the greatest and having the star die in it you would think in honor of brandon lee it would be the only one. and whats with switchingfrom miramax to dimension. in my opinion demensionscrewed it the most.i hope that gives you an idea of how stupid all the crow movies hav gotten and how this one sucks . r.i.p. brandon
5,for those you think they are Crow fans,"To me the Crow Stairway to Heaven was a great follow up from the orignal movie ""The Crow"". The second move of the Crow was a poor follow up. The Video Stairway to Heaven turned into a TV series followed the the begining of the comic book and also the orignal movie but with a twist. He doen't go back to rest like the movie. But the acting was great and the story lines were very good. Mark Dacascos, does an excellant job playing his part has Eric. And it was a shame that the TV series ended. Those who say they true Crow fans that follow the comic book, should stick to reading the Comic book and probably should subscribe to Marvel. The video to me is a must see and if you can see the TV series, should."
5,The Stairway To Heaven....,"This series is based on the originial (Not surpassing it, though) It shows a battle between the Crow and the Snake. The human-villains are made supernatural, which is a good add.If Brandon Lee was still alive, he probably would've starred in this.... Well, putting the sad things aside, I will advise you to buy this.-----------------------------------------------------------------Sorry, can't remember any quotes at the moment."
1,This is a very bad remake of the first crow movie,"They basically took The Crow and redid it here. similar characters, names, some appearance and such, basic order of events, some lines. The actors are ALL different and barely look the same. It is not nearly as beautiful or dramatic. Some lines are repeated, but with different context and no feeling. It feels rushed. The city is not dark or rainy like the original. It almost looks like it was made for a tv series. It's not really worth the money, and I'd rather watch the crow 2 than this blasphemous remake. I don't really know why they made it. It wouldn't make sense for this to replace an out of stock original; it can just be re-released. I rented it thinking it was the crow 3, but was disappointed and disgusted. it's not worth it; they asted time and money in making it. I actually give it 0 stars but 1 was the minumum."
2,did not last that long,I got this ring for my BD last year. It did look much better then on the picture...but after few days of wearing it the leaf part break off :)It`s hard to find a place to fix it.
1,The Collector Edition Doesn't Work,"I liked the Apostle so much, I bought the Collector's Edition DVD -- the expanded version that has footage of Duvall talking about the film. I could only get certain sections of the DVD to work. In another review, someone said the same thing. This edition is technically flawed."
4,Simply the Truth!,"I really liked the movie Apostle. It inspired me to respond to my call to preach and it is just plain truth. I am what you would call a ""Charismatic style"" minister. What attracted me to it, was the wording and how it moved its audience. God used this movie, and I know it touched me in a way that only me and God know."
5,Don't get tired of wathching this one!,This movie is so great on so many levels. The acting of Robert Duvall is incredible. I recently started going to a Pentecostal church and seeing the movie now affected me on a much deeper level than before when I wasn't involved in the church at all. This movie really shows our humanity/sinful nature but it also shows us a celebration of God's AMAZING GRACE.This movie is fantastic! Duvall would have got my vote for the Oscar
5,The Apostle,This movie was absolutely great. A lot of people( the actors and actresses) got saved in the movie. This was not expected at all.
1,Not true to its title...,It's an interesting movie but as far as representing true Christianity or what it means to be a real apostle or a man who loves God it is far less than accurate. If you're just looking for something to watch rather than enjoy this movie works for that but I wouldn't get any beliefs about what an apostle is from this movie.
4,Uneducated Southern preacher,Duvall is excellent as a small church southern preacher leading two lives. The Apostle shows the human nature in all people. A person without anger is rare. Most people are able to control their anger. Sonny's (Duvall) uncontrol anger leads to a crime and his attempt to escape the law while bringing together the people of a small town to form a church. The movie closes with Sonny in a full church and the police standing at the door waiting on Sonny to end the service and his arrest.
2,Gary Hoyt,"Robert DeNiro is definately out of character in this film. In my opinion not much of a story plot, slow moving and generally a poorly done film. It went to the public library."
1,Rated B for boring,"This has to be the most boring movie I've ever seen. I keptasking myself, ""isn't it over yet"". Stay away from this turkeyunless you need a good snooze. 1 star is a much too high rating."
2,"Fine Duvall performance, but I found it dull","This was a movie I really expected to like-- and that I really wanted to like. I've always been a big fan of Duvall, and I had heard nothing but good about this film from critics-- including critics who I usually find myself in agreement with. And in truth, Duvall does give a stunning performance as a passionate, devout, committed, and yet very flawed and very human evangelical preacher. Nonetheless, I found myself quite bored with this movie. I just didn't find the character he portrays to be that *interesting*. Nor did I find the circumstances in which he found himself (i.e. the plot) to make for that exciting of a story. Maybe my expectations were just raised too high by all the praise of the film that I heard. Or maybe, if evangical Christianity were a personal issue in my life, I would have found this character study more engaging. But, sadly, the story really just didn't do anything for me."
2,I was extremely dissapointed with this film.,"The portrayal of this Evangelist and of his flaws was not exactly uplifting! If he was supposed to be putting his life ""back together"" it sure was a strange way of doing it. First he comes on way too strong with the secretary at the radio station and then he goes on to have an all out brawl with a fellow right in the middle of a church service. As he quotes from the Bible after the fight ""we are supposed to turn the other cheek"" not beat the crap out of him! For all of those non-Christians out there I don't believe this would be the best movie to base your beliefs on. It was very mis-leading. I gave it a 2 because Robert Duvall is, after all, a very talented actor. But, I would suggest for him to stick to being an actor and not the writer."
3,Interesting but NOT great,"It really is too bad that it took so long for Robert Duvall to make this movie as I thought he was a too old for his part. At the beginning, I honestly thought those were his GRANDCHILDREN and June Carter Cash was his wife. (Alot of Southern men call their wives ""Momma"": annoying but true). Duvall plays a VERY VERY flawed haracter. Several reviewers would have you believe that he is somehow ""redeemed"" at the end. Really? Because he so-called saves Billy Bob Thorntons character and that other young man? Give me a break! Speaking of BBT, he gives an extremely wooden performance, even worse than the too low-key Farrah. The preaching throughout this movie can be spellbinding but the last sermon Duvalls character gives is way too long and how come no one in the congregation notices or seems to care that the cops are there?While it's not a total waste of time, it's not one I'd watch again."
4,"Put God first, not your own desires.","I enjoyed this movie as it shows what can happen when a man of God goes his own rebellious way. When we as believers in Christ (those who accept Jesus as Saviour) make our own decisions without God, we will eventually fail in the end. We become carnal (of the flesh). But, when we return to God, we will conquer over the world, and be brought back to the throne of God (become spiritual). It is better to be of the Spirit (God's Spirit) than of the flesh (our own wants and desires). God's Grace is there for all to be saved and redeemed in Jesus Christ, no matter what we have done or will do. Once we receive Christ as our personal Saviour, we are saved and have the free gift of eternal life from God Himself. If we sin (or rebel) against God, we just have to confess that sin to God and repent (turn away from sin) and go back to God. We have a hope in Jesus Christ, God's Son."
4,The best acting I've ever seen,This film has as its subject religious themes that are not very appealing to most people. The story without Duvall would be much less. But what a job he does! He is the character. A rare performance that should be seen.
3,Great acting; less than great story,"""The Apostle"" was not a very good film. However, Robert Duvall was so great that he almost challenges George C. Scott('Patton') for the best acting performance I have ever seen. I came away from the theater nearly convinced that Duvall really was a preacher. I actually had a similar feeling after the ""Godfather"" and ""A Civil Action""- he is so good he makes you believe that he is what he plays. His brilliance makes up for a less than grand movie."
5,The naturalness of jumping up and down in church,"""The Apostle"" captures the body language of Pentecostal Christians--portraying, for example, the naturalness of jumping up and down in church. Respect for Pentecostal faith is the movie's frame around the story of Sonny, a preacher on the lam. Sonny discovers that his wife (played with shadowy understatement by Farrah Fawcett) and the youth minister are having an affair, so Sonny swings a bat at the man's head, which is imprudent enough but characteristic of Sonny's temperament--And it sends him into hiding along the bayous of rural Louisiana. There Sonny transforms himself into the Apostle E.F. and founds a church, while waiting for the law to catch up with him. The movie is a character study, rather than a narrative or a documentary, and it succeeds by generating sympathy for the Apostle E.F., who is a leader and a felon and an inhabitant of a charismatic world that's closer at hand than we think.Bob Niles"
3,Powerful,Somewhat raw ... but NOT the way all ministers are. This extreme portrayal helps remind leaders of potential for abuse.
2,"Nice Performance, Boring Story","I found the plot extremely repetitious and boring. Nothing much happens except a lot of preaching and good intentions. Some nice acting by Duvall. But I couldn't believe in him as a genuine man of God because he showed no deep emotional remorse over his killing the pastor or over the abusive way he treated his wife. He just runs away and tries to start a new life. This showed he was a coward, unready to take responsibility for his base actions. If he had any sense of conscience, he would have given himself up to the law and accepted his punishment for his vicious act. The movie was much too long."
1,"Good acting, BAD MOVIE.",Robert Duvall did a great job in this movie. The movie itself was horrible. I had no feelings for the main character. All main characters were horribly immoral. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.
1,Too Boring For Words,"Worse than losing more than 2 hours of my life on this boring, over-rated piece of drek, I spent the last weekend of my father's life in the theater duped by critics into believing this thing might be entertaining. Duvall is definitely too full of himself and has fallen into the rut of being the same character in every movie he has made since ""Lonesome Dove.""I have regretted giving up those hours I could have spent with my dying father watching this horrible movie. Critics, shame on you for duping us!!!"
5,A struggle between a human nature and a divine calling.,"The apostle is one of the most outstanding movies produced by Hollywood that I have ever seen. Robert Duval has always been one of my favorite actors, but to think that he would write, direct and finance this movie is truly amazing. I think all the characters are believalbe and well played. He truly presents the Gospel in the flavor of the south without being demeaning as so often is the case. I was deeply touched by this movie. While the characters themselves obviously have their faults I think the message is ""Christians are not perfect, just forgiven! I truly hope that someone who would never go to church or listen to a preaching service on TV will hear what is being said in this movie and give God a try!"""
5,power,this product is really amazing it has lots of power ...you can plug 4 subwoofers cerwin vegas to it and it really does put lot of power to them
3,not really a counting book,"Yes, the rhyming text is cute, and my daughter loved the buzzing sound on the last page. However, we only got the book about 9 months ago (and only read it occasionally), and it no longer makes the buzzing noise. The batteries can be changed, though. Although the book is set up like ""Ten Little Ladybugs"" by Melanie Gerth, there is no counting going on in the text of the story. In fact, the text repeatedly refers to ""Bee"" (singular) which more often than not doesn't coincide with the several bees in the pictures. This book is fine, but does not really function as a counting book. I mean, there are only nine bees on the front cover--I guess I would expect ten. The illustrations are mediocre; there is just too much going on in most of the pictures. Overall, it doesn't really spark imagination and discussion."
2,Don't bother,"My 15-month old loves his big sisters' ""10 Little Ladybugs"", so I bought this bee book for him. The buzzing sound only works half the time and the cut-out bees on the cover aren't on every page (as in other similar books). A disappointment, for sure."
1,Buzzing didn't work long,"The story is cute. But I can't figure out how to get the buzzing sound to work every time. My daughter loves that it buzzes and she wants me to make it work, but, it comes on only sometimes. Its not worth the effort to return it. I don't recommend buying it."
4,Very cool book.,"My son, who is not yet 1 1/2, loves Buzz-Buzz, Busy Bees. He likes to look at all the animals, and after we've finished the book he likes to keep opening the back page to hear the buzzing (sometimes he even dances to it). The illustrations are really engaging, and I like the fact that the farmer at the end of the book is female.I don't like the material that covers the bees--it's similar to velveteen, which gives me goosebumps. Also, I'm a little skeptical about some of the ideas in the book--would a bee want to play with a dog? Would a rooster drink honey? But this kind of silliness is okay, given the format, and the book really is a pleasure to read aloud."
2,Misleading Condition,"The condition of the book I purchased was supposed to be ""very good"". I received it and the last 2 pages have half of the page torn off and most of the bee bodies are rubbed off. Very disappointed."
1,Disappointing,"Although I love Brown Sheep yarns, this book does not do them justice. The photography features overly made up models in their brightly colored knits, but it's actually hard to see the sweaters and other garments. Photos or diagrams of technical details are non-existent. Styles are unsophisticated, but if you want to make legwarmers for your dog, you'll find a pattern here - complete with bobbles! I'll pass, thanks!"
1,This is probably a ncie pattern book for older women,"Boring and out of style if you are looking for something young, fashsion, up-to-date style. But it should be a very good one if you want something more basic, simple and ordinary. I won't call the patterns classic. And it has 3 or 4 kids patterns and GOD....they are ugly."
5,Good service,"Reply was prompt, and book was as stated as far as condition. Was satisfied with product and service."
2,More photos than text.,"I was very disappointed and will be returning this book because it was little more than a collection of photos of various keeshonden. There was no valuable or unique information that could not be found in any general dog book. If you just want photos to scan or look at, take pictures of your own Keeshond, but if you want to purchase photos of someone elses, this book is for you."
2,A Boring Tale,"I had so hoped this version of Little Red Riding Hood --- featuring stars whose work I admire --- would be something I could share with my granddaughters. ages 6-12. Not so. This version of the tale is slow-moving, repetitious, and boring. Not at all something the kids would enjoy."
4,Soundtracks,"Harry Dean Stanton's, (Make Yourself At Home In My Heart), is an all-time favorite of mine; and so is, ""The Mist"", by Erin Kenney and Ethan James. Pray For Rain carry the mood; love, ""Hot White Sun""."
3,"Skilled, hypersensitive, but not a fun read","I think the reader has to be in the right frame of mind to appreciate this novel. It's short, it's not complicated . . . but it can be tough sledding, because it feels like reading the journal of an acute depressive -- and that doesn't automatically make for a pleasurable reading experience.One can't help admiring the craft of this book, and the pointedness of the narrator's observations (""that expression you get in your eyes when . . . you are starting to know what things are like underneath what people say they are""). But this is the furthest thing from a summer beach novel, and I'd recommend it mainly to readers who have a good solid sense of themselves and can maintain a proper distance from the narrative. 'Cause it's a real downer."
1,This Is An Outrage!!!,"I can't believe the way they portay southerners. I mean, we always get portrayed as being unebucated, and dum... why's that, huh? This is the most degrobulating film i have ever whitnessed. If you're from the south - just like me - than you will protest this southern debauchery.Don't see this blubert of a movie - it's deligerant!"
2,"BORING, NOT FUNNY, POOR COMEDY PLOT","You better not believe some of the other reviews. First of all, the plot is that she has to get her divorce final so she can marry someone else. This happens in real life all the time, and is not a funny situation. Reese has no comic ability at all. You will be happy when this boring, unfunny piece of garbage ends. The music is kinda nice, and it has a commentary track, so maybe I can get some value for my money. If you want REAL comedy, get NEVER AGAIN."
1,Bad,"It's these types of romantic comedies that give the genre a bad name. Stereotypes, predictable comedy and romance with one dimensional characters. A forgettable film that is meant for cable. Rent Notting Hill or Annie Hall. Those are romantic comedies worth watching."
2,SWEET,Setting- This story is of course in Alabama and some of it takes place in New YorkWife- Melanie wants to be the wife of a sucessful business man but at the end of the story she relizes that her other husband is right for her.Exciting- This movie is very exciting and adventurous and Melanie tries everything to get her husband to sign the divorce papers.Everything- In Melanie's world everything is so messed up and confusing and she doesn't know what to do.Trick- Melanie keeps tricking her husband by doing all this wacky stuff such as taking his money from the bank and telling him it isn't against the law becuase they are still married.
1,Very predictable movie,This movie was a real flop. It was predictable from the get go. No creativity or imagination can be found in this movie. It is not worth the 3 or 4 dollars it would cost to rent it. I very much enjoyed Legaly Blonde and was expecting a similar level of enjoyment. What a let down. Also it would seem that Ms. Witherspoon has shed enough pounds to lower herself from a very attractive woman to a gaunt stick...very sad.
2,"A southern fantasy, a southern farce","Extremely funny, saw it with my youngest daughter who also thought it was funny to make me sit through American Pie II (the guy who playted the Jewish father was fantastic). Aside from the laughs, though, the political overtones were appalling. Yankees consist of witch-like feminist Democrats who manipulate weak men. Southern men are sympathetic, caring, harmless, Bubba-Republicans who can win their women back from the evil Yankess by being smart and working hard, creating products that will even sell in NY (well, W sold in NY, so why not). Blacks are----well----maids. Otherwise, there are apparenly no Blacks in Alabama. Candice Bergen, it was good for laughs but where are your political principles in this age of world domination by right wing religious fanatacism and neo-classical economic ideology? You gone over to the other side too, like most of the other Democrats?"
1,Reese Witherspoon should be ashamed of herself for this.,"""Sweet Home Alabama"" seems to suggest that everything a woman accomplishes as an adult is meaningless, because she really loves the jerk who knocked her up in high school, and really just wants to go back to her double-wide and fry something for him, after she slugs the mayor of New York.What annoys me even more about ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is that it seems to be, just under the surface, a little video Defense of Marriage Ammendment. Bear in mind, please, that DOMAs have thus far been used exclusively to defraud married transsexuals of their rights, and that's what I'm seeing here--that Melanie Carmichael, regardless of her decisions, efforts and beliefs, was still Melanie Smooter; and that her new marriage in her new life couldn't really happen because of this.Reese Witherspoon is a superb actress who probably could have and really should have rejected this part, which is not only demeaning to Alabama, but to women and marriage as well."
4,Very cool and funny comedy!!,"A sweet, well made commedy that provides plenty of laughs and it masks the usual love story cliches well enough to make it interesting."
4,Though not up for the next Oscar....it was a cute fun flick.,I am a huge fan of actress Reese Witherspoon...her Legally Blonde movie upped her from just another oscar nominee to earning her A-List respect. I had been waiting to go with my two girlfriends to go and see it....we had got there an hour early. I was a little dissapointed in it. I knew from the get-go Reese was going to end up not marrying her fiancee from New York...and would stick with her old husband....from the previews it was obvious. It is a very good movie to go out and have fun. It brings the romantic out in anyone. I am a movie-addict and have a long list of of favorite movies...I could say it is one of my favorites..but maybe only ebcause Reese is my favorite actress...or it might be because of the cutesy-lines and funny moments. ~
4,Doris Day 2002,"You can tell I'm a baby boomer who grew up watching bubbly Doris Day in umpteen romantic comedies! I must say it was refresing to once again see a delightful actress fill the screen and the movie with an upbeat light hearted performance.No, this is not a movie that requires thinking or angst just a very nice way to wile awway a few hours. What with all that is going on these days, I find myself needing entertainment that just plain makes me feel good and this move accomplishes that!"
3,Sweet Home Alabama,"Good Start and cute finish, but thoroughly predicatable. Could have used a much better plot. Main Character was offensively cruel, but naturally changes the longer she's there."
3,"Chick Flick, but kinda funny","I just saw this last night, and it was definately a girl's movie, but it had its funny moments. The movie followed the character of Melanie, Reese Witherspoon, who worked as a fashion designer and just got engaged. However, she has to go to Alabama to get her old husband to sign divorce papers. This is not as easy of a task as she had hoped, and she ends up staying in Alabama a lot longer than se thought. I laughed on a couple parts, but I thought it was a little predictable like any ofther chick movie."
5,Nice romantic comedy,"The first time I saw this one, I thought Witherspoon's character was a little too unlikable for the lead in a romantic comedy, however, after watching the movie more than once I don't feel as much that way. This is a nice movie that still has a few surprises even though you kind of get the feeling you know where things are going. The one thing this movie is lacking that usually shows up in most romantic comedies is a seriously dumb moment in which the characters look goofy and completely unbelievable. That's a plus. The movie has fun with sterotypes about the south and big cities like New York without going too far over the line. It's definitely worth buying a copy of this movie for occasions when you want to watch a nice light movie."
5,Patty's Comments,This is a wonderful movie to watch completely entranced the first time around and then to just have on as company (or in the wee hours of the morning when you can't sleep) for the sheer fun of it. I have watched it repeatedly--everything works out right. The jilted fellow even gets someone who is better for him. The acting is superb and the storyline sweet. You will love it!
5,Good Movie,I have always liked this movie. Maybe more now because I will soon be moving to Alabama. It reminds me of myself and my reconnected Soul Mate!
3,Cliche',Movie had promise...it had some comedic moments. Then it went down the typical romantic comedy trail. I like Reese Witherspoon...she could've done better.
5,Great Entertainment,"A very entertaining movie with the strength and appeal of Reese Witherspoon at the center of it all. She dominates the movie with intelligence, personality, and wholesome good looks. Good homespun depiction of Alabama, and on the whole a good view of Americana Alabama style. Candice Bergen terrific as the mayor of New York as was Jean Smart and Fred Ward in small parts. Southern actors in the movie were very interesting, especially Josh Lucas who plays Witherspoon's childhood boyfriend and present husband. Added benefit is a staged depiction of Civil War battle scenes. Good enjoyable entertainment, terrific acting by everyone involved, and definitely a Five-Star movie, if your purpose is entertainment."
4,Your typical romantic comedy with a North vs. South twist,"Melanie Carmichael (Reese Witherspoon) is the hottest new designer in New York, newly engaged to the hottest bachelor in town - the mayor's son. There's only one thing wrong with Melanie's life - she's actually Melanie Smooter, born & raised in a small & ppor Alabama town, where she married her high school sweetheart she still hadn't divorced.Well, this being a North Vs. South comedy, we get the worst kind of stereotypes on both ends - most of the NY people are just plain weird, and the southerners all live in shabby homes & fry anything in sight.On the other hand, the performances were very good - not only from the 3 major players, but especially from the supporting cast.The director's commentary on the movie, & the wxended scenes (also with optional commentary by the director) were very enjoyable."
2,Don't waste your time,"This movie was a movie I had hoped for a few good lines, and then a feel good ending. Well I the only few lines were the overplayed lines of the preview, ""You have a baby, in a bar"" that was about the only good line. I watched this movie in a plane thinking, ""hey a movie, that i wanted to see for free"" afterwards I would have rather been listening to the lady next to me as she sang to headphones than watch that movie ever again. The plot was predictable beyond anything I have ever seens, the lines were cheesy, it was broadly stereotypical, and the best thing that the movie had was the clothes that Witherspoon wore. And you think i am a cynical ""I hate Reese"" but I don't I loved her in Cruel Intentions and in Legally Blonde which surprised me greatly. Sweet Home Alabama is not a movie I would ever suggest to anyone. Don't waste your time. Too bad the song was wasted on a terrible movie"
2,Like the movie but terrible Blu-Ray conversion,"I bought the movie because my wife likes it so much and it makes her laugh. I am a geek and I like to see movies in Hi-Def but that is where this review receives the 2 stars. My Playstaion 3 up-converts the rental DVD better than this Blu-Ray looks. If you are thinking of purchasing this movie now, save some money and get the DVD because there is no reason to waste extra $$ for the Blu-Ray. The packaging indicates it is a ""new digital restoration with enhanced picture and sound"", but my opinion is they lied/mis-led us with this statement."
1,Horrible,"Sorry, I'm a guy! This movie was just not good, if you are female and enjoy the typical chick flick then buy this. I enjoyed the twist on the usual plot, this time it is a woman who is after more then one guy and not a he whore. Unlike most movies like this you end up really hating the person she leaves, not in this one. Both guys are really great, but nonetheless she proceeds to emotionally scare both of them from beginning to the end! At the end of these movies you expect the main character to learn a lesson, not in this one. Nothing changes she just chooses, that hurt the movie for me. Again, if you are a guy don't watch, it will give you headaches."
1,I'd rather be at the dentist's having a root canal,"To sum it up in a nutshell, it was tacky and ... It promotes the stereotype that all Southerners are hicks who eat grits and wear white sheets over their head. What's her face is supposed a world famous fasion designer but can't dress, Also, she runs to her dumb ... drunk ex. Please, this movie was over-hyped and a total waste of $."
1,DVD Purchase,"The dvd arrived in appropriate time frame from PB (???) It would not play. I wrote email to PB and they explained it was a ""Region 2"" dvd as stated in their ad. I do not know what that means and would not have known even if I read it. They were kind enough to give me an address to return the dvd, which I did, for a refund. I am waiting for the refund. I hate that I have been unable to use it and had to return it."
3,"I like the movie,","I tried to watch the movie several times, however the picture was crappy. You could see the pixels on the screen, it wasn't coming in HD and I had the local cable company over to see if were my cable. It turns out it was the Roku I had bought. I don't suggest you buy a Roku."
3,Typical and predictable,"For all the hype it's gotten,Sweet Home Alabamais pretty typical and predictable. The plot is the same as hundreds of other romantic comedies with little to make it unique or interesting. Indeed, I had the whole story figured in the first 5 minutes. As always, Reese Witherspoon does a good job with her role, but the rest of the characters are forgettable. Overall, nothing special, but cute for date nights."
2,Rather......boring.......,I thought that Sweet Home Alabama was cute in the beggining... but alldownhillfromthereThe movie just drags on and on and I had some trouble staying awake. Definitly not one of my favorites.
3,Bland,"I saw Sweet Home Alabama with my sister, and I just want to start out by saying I didn't rent it, she did. The only reason I watched this was because of Reese Witherspoon and her hilarious role in Legally Blonde in 2001. I laughed, oh, maybe 4 times during this movie. I would mostly just describe it as ""moderately amusing"". The plot is boring, I almost fell asleep twice. I just really didn't care at all what happened, and the ""twist"" towards the end was just plain stupid. If I were you I'd save my money for Legally Blonde."
3,Enjoyable but predictable,"Reese Witherspoon is a very entertaining actor with a few gem movies up her sleeve (ie. Election & Legally Blonde). ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is entertaining but very predictable. Storyline focusses on a pretentious woman about to marry a politician's son but needs to go back to her hometown first to clean out the skeletons in her closet. The movie didn't do great things at the box office but is good enough entertainment for a friday night at home with a DVD and a block of chocolate.DVD SUMMARY:The DVD features a 16:9 transfer, eight deleted scenes as well as an alternate ending. This ending was originally the one they wanted to go with, but test audiences didn't approve. Let me say that the ending that did get used is indeed better."
3,Loved the movie,"The movie was great -one of my favs. But the DVD was a bit of a disappointment. For some reason, on & off throughout the movie closed caption would suddenly appear and then disappear. Plus there were a couple of nano-second pauses in this movie. This was supposed to be a ""new"" DVD, but it sure doesn't appear to be. This is the first Amazon product I've been disappointed in."
4,Fun and light,"This is definitely a light romantic comedy. Reese Witherspoon plays an up-and-coming New York fashion designer with the perfect life laid out in front of her - including the perfect boyfriend. When circumstances arise that take her back to her roots in rural Alabama, her two worlds clash and the fun begins. While there are many humorous, funny parts there are also some heartwarming/thoughtful moments as well. Reese Witherspoon is great in this lead role and Josh Lucas is perfect for the part he plays.Not ""serious"" film but enjoyable -- a good, entertaining movie."
5,Where the skies are so blue...,"This movie shows you that no matter how far you go, you can never forget your roots."
5,"!!GREAT MOVIE, A MUST SEE!!","This is the best movie I saw all year!! Reese is great in it, I adore her. I am so happy with the ending...The story is soo sweet and yet not sappy or corny, the perfect love story. The comedic parts are hilarious, it's very easy to relate to the movie in every aspect (except not all of us have even been to Tiffany's, let alone told to pic whatever we wanted.) The soundtrack is also the coolest, I am pround to say that as of Feb. 4th I will own them both."
3,Your average rom-com,"After building herself a successful life in New York with her own designing company, Melanie Carmichael (Reese Witherspoon) couldn't be happier especially when the man of her dreams (Patrick Dempsey) proposes to her.However in order for her to move on to her future, she must bury her past which means returning to her hometown Alabama to settle a divorce with ex lover (Josh Lucas). However is Melanie truly ready to forget what she once had and move on with her new love and secondly can she successfully hide her shameful past from her current boyfriend.Romantic comedy which becomes a battle of the classes- between the rich and the poor. Although predictable and average, this rom-com still manages to pull in a few laughs with good performanaces from all characters."
1,Stink Home Alabama,"Reese Witherspoon's character is mean and totally without charm, to say nothing of some highly questionable outfits for someone claiming to be in the fashion industry. An excrutiating test of endurance."
2,Region 2 :P,"It works fine on my computer but I did not know that region 2 meant it wouldn't work on my dvd player... I do not know how to fix that, wish it said something or had a warning about that..."
1,Watch Out,This movie will not work if your current wife is from the North and you are from the South. If your current wife has been divorced before DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!! Just my 2 cents.
1,racist and childish,"even if this movie was a success,it stinkcoz very predectible ,nothing new,and very american dream,i mean the hypocrite part of our country,and a feeling of racism inside,black poeple wouldnt be pleased!"
4,Above average Hollywood love story,"Romantic comedy with thin plot but charming characters saved mainly by good acting. Don't feel too bad about wasting 1.5 hours on this. It does what it should. It serves as a fluffy entertainment. Southern cliches are way overdone (again, except for Reese Witherspoon who really manages to raise above the material)."
4,Great Date Movie!,This is a great movie to watch with a date. This is the most romantic movie that came out in 2002. I took a date to it and she absolutely loved it. I didn't mind it much either. There were some funny parts. Comedy movies are great in every collection. They are movies that you can watch again and again. If you watch a lot of movies with your boyfriend or girlfriend this is a movie for you. I really liked the ending; I will not spoil anything for you though. I give this truly romantic comedy four out of five stars. A great date movie!
3,Disappointing,"Well, I picked up this movie because I simply loved Reese in ""Legally Blonde"". That movie was a smash. This one is trying hard to capitalize on the Blonde fame.Too predictable, the Southern rednecks were far to stereotyped and Reese was trying too hard, lovely as she is.Sorry Amazon, but in my opinion you should NOT buy this DVD. Rent this on Blockbuster and you'll thank me...I gave it 3 stars because it's sorta entertaining. That's all."
3,Sweet&Predictable,It was nice and pleasant. While it's has moments. Mostly the movie was predictable. If like Reese Witherspoon you'll love this movie
1,Not a home anyone would recognize,"This movie is an insult to Southerners, an insult to women, and an insult to anyone with any degree of intelligence. I was thoroughly disappointed -- I had really expected this to be much more clever."
1,Lightning does NOT strike twice in the same place,"You know, before I saw the alternate ending to this movie, I didn't think it was all THAT bad. But that cut scene just put me over the top. This has got to be one of the cheesiest, intellectually deprived, and most idiotic romantic comedies in recent memory. Aside from being the typical cookie-cutter plot, without any speck of originality, there was not even enough humor to keep me awake. The best actor in this movie was the dog. Oh, and by the way, ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is a Lynyrd Skynyrd song, and should NOT be played by that stupid cover band in the movie. Don't even bother."
3,not as good as expected,"first of all, reese witherspoon is a great actress, and i liked her performance in this movie. but that was probably the only thing i really liked. surprisingly enough, i was more sympathetic to the tough, aggressive, even-if-somewhat-rude reese in the beginning than i was to her sapped-down character at the end. i found the whole southern small-town charm storyline to be unoriginal and overused. during most of the duration of the movie, i kept hoping that reese would find her way back to new york. the idea of a successful, independent, beautiful young woman giving up everything for a guy was just horrific to me. and sadly enough, i couldn't even be impressed with josh lucas's performance because of that."
4,Not bad,"I thought this was a cute movie. Not exactly an Oscar-winner, but we already knew that!Reese Whitherspoon, newly engaged, leaves her elite life and new fiance in Manhatten to go back home to Alabama to get a divorce from her first husband (her childhood sweet heart).The longer she's back in Alabama, the more she realizes how much she missed it.It's cute a movie. Funny moments. Kind of predictable, but definitely worth watching!"
2,Sweet Home Alabama is not that Sweet,"I watched this movie with my husband after we had heard all the rave reviews about this movie and expected something funny, comical and just clever. Sadly disappointed, because you have to watch almost the entire movie to find out what drove Melanie and her husband to be apart for 7 years!!! It had some humorous scenes, but nothing outstanding. Candice Bergen plays a typical ""Murphy Brown"" role but as a mayor, which really does her no justice. Its just ""Murphy Brown"" who is a mayor, has a young eligible and handsome son and is suspicious of who he is marrying. I can safely say, I will not watch this movie again."
4,Reese Witherspon is very good,"I donnot think this is a great movie, but I saw it the other day and the thing that saved it from being terrible is the main actress who is named Reese Witherspoon. Yes, she's the same one from the ""blond"" movies about the shallow blond girl running around and doing stupid things. She's very good in this one and if you are in the mood for something light, this is a good option. You should enjoy her performance!"
3,I just don't get it,"The movie is highly watchable. The characters, though predictable, are well written and acted quite well also. The dialog is funny and there are some interesting twists and turns. The sets are pleasing, the characters for the most part are in line with the settings and the accents aren't too far off base. So what is the problem? For me the overall story simply does not work. It becomes obvious about halfway through the movie that there can be no truly satisfying denouement. Someone has to pay in the end for this girls senseless carelessness and it is in no way obvious who that will be. So we end up simply waiting to find out who pays the price. There is equal sadness meted along with the joy and we are asked to sweep it under the rug. Singing and dancing and a singed cat are poor cover indeed for an ending which though expected, does not satisfy."
1,wouldnt play in my dvd player.,I ordered this dvd to take on vacation and when my teenager tried to jplay it it wouldnt play. The dvd was from region 2 which i was unaware when i purchased it. I returned it when we got home but we were still very disappointed. be careful what u purchase from this seller.
5,Movie,"I got this product in a small amount of time, It was in good condition and I will continue to buy movies from Amazon."
5,Very Sweet,This was an excellent movie; I wished I had seen it when it first came out. I enjoyed it very much!
2,"Bad story, or writing, or editing... last 1/3 OK","The first two thirds of this movie were horrible. RW's attire is horrible for an alleged fashion expert. She is NOT a likeable character in this film. You don't get a bond between her & Jake at all, that one kid scene was not enough at all. It just doesn't work. The end was cute, but again not fulfilling. The star who played Jake and Jean Smart were the best characters in the film, and the only ones with integrity."
2,A Just Alright Movie,"It's all been done before. The woman trying to find herself leaves her past behind to find a better life, becoming someone she is not, later to find out she has betrayed the very people who care about her.This plot has been used in countless movies. Ummm...... none come to mind right now but the movie just seemed to familiar for us to care. Plus the ending gets so jumbled that i think even the cast did not know what was going on. The movie does have its laughs, but all in all turns out to be a ridiculous and awkward premise for this type of movie.I'm sure some women will still flock to go see this movie and make their boyfriends go see it as well, since now favorite Reese Witherspoon is in it and it has already made quite a bit of money. But as for pure intelligence and originality it has none. I would recommend the movie for its minor laughs or if you would just like to laugh at the movie itself for its silly storyline."
4,So romantic!,"She would have made the right choice with either man. :) This was a fun movie, I cried and laughed for most of it."
1,Dreadful,"I got to see this for free and I still felt ripped off. The story is awful. There isn't a single ounce of character development, so poor Ms. Witherspoon comes across as a total beyotch. It does have the distinction, though, of containing the most emotionless marriage proposal scene ever (the materialistic ringfest at Tiffanys) and the character with the dumbest job ever (lightning-sand sculptor). And if it was funny, I forgot to laugh. Or, more likely, they forgot to put in the jokes."
3,your type,"if youre going to be a serious movie sinic and sit down to watch this, you will find as many problems with it as you want. however this is a homegrown warm and happy flick. guys i hope you wont watch it alone but if you want to watch a movie with your woman then this is a good choice, she'll prolly like and/or envy it. nice original chick-flick with a well-thought and resonable plot."
2,So this was a comedy???? Maybe it was a typo....,"This film had so much potential to be funny. There was bubbly and adorable Reese, hunky Josh, and a rich girl goes back to hometown plot...but with the predictable script, it was just, well, too predictable, for a lack of words. At times, you wanted to yawn and wait for that boring scene to end and get to the good stuff, but there just wasn't any! Unless you have the humor mentality of a 10 year old teenybopper, there was no way this could be funny! I consider myself a very open-minded when it comes to humor, but when you can guess what's going to happen next the first time you see the dang movie, it gets tiring waiting for that unpredictable moment. C'mon, you all knew Reese and Josh were going to get together in the end!"
1,Redneck Propaganda,"This movie is pure propaganda for the ""south-will-rise-again"" right-wing know-nothing worldview prevalent for most of the reign of Bush II. Southerners with their down-home anti-intellectual ""authenticity"" are pitted against ""phony elitist"" northeastern liberals. The southerners come out ahead in the end when Reese's Witherspoon's character, an up-and-coming fashion designer, leaves the son of New York City's mayor to return to Alabama and the redneck husband she had been trying to divorce. Predictable, not even remotely funny, downright depressing. I know Reese Witherspoon is from Tennessee, but she's supposed to be intelligent and not exactly a Rush Limbaugh disciple. I can't imagine why she didn't see through this script in two seconds and put it in its well-deserved place in the recycling bin."
2,SUCKS!!! SUCKS!!! SUCKS!!!!,"This movie is horrible!!! It is so boring !! Now I love reese Witherspoon, but in this movie she didnt look that great in SWeet home alabama. its like 90 min of peeps talking with a southern accent. WHAT THE FCUK !!!!!!!! i rated this 2 stars because Reese looks somewat good. For a good chic flick, getTHE LIZZIE MCGUIRE MOVIE, MAID IN MANHATAN,LEGALLY BLONDE, AND CHARLIE'S ANGELS."
2,"Come on, Reese","After Legally Blonde, I figured Reese Witherspoon could grab onto any old hunk of nonsense, hoist it up on those shapely shoulders and carry it across the finish line all by her lonesome. Well, here's the movie that proves it ain't necessarily so.I'm sure the public will generally enjoy (or at least not be offended by) this trifle, but if like me, you enjoyed seeing Reese's talent blossom in harder edged fare like Freeway, Pleasantville and Election, you'll hope one of these romantic comedy bon-bons tanks at the box office so she can get back to making real movies."
3,Proof That The South's Still Dead,"When you can't afford Matthew McC, hire Josh Lucas. America's new sweetheart, Reese Witherspoon -- night now, Sandy B. -- does her best at holding this most formulaic so-called romance together. Seriously, I'd type how I REALLY feel but I just realized that I'd be wasting more time than I did WATCHING this 122 minute fiasco. If you don't see every single angle coming, then you might as well stop seeing films. Utter trash. And I'm not certain that a single stereotype goes unwrapped. Reese, you're better than this. But after ""Legally Blonde"" and this, you might have to re-prove yourself."
3,annoying from a legal standpoint,"The movie was cute, but from a legal standpoint, it was irritating.First of all, how did Melanie get a marriage license to get remarried if her divorce papers (and decree) were never filed? Particularly considering the fact that she her second wedding was in the same town as her first. Even if she signed the papers, they still need to be filed and a decree entered by a Judge.Maybe I'm reading way too much into this (it is only a movie)."
2,Classless warfare.,"First of all, how can a woman be named Reese Witherspoon? I guess my only complaint about this movie--besides its absurdity--is all those Hollywood actors talkin' with them phony southern accents.It might seem like a small detail but it reinforces the stereotypes of the two most disliked groups in our country: New Yorkers and Southerners. Some will say this is deserved and I can't disagree but snobs vs. hillbillies just isn't very funny or touching to me."
5,Awesome!,"She's Sweet! Reese Witherspoon plays a rich clothing desinger who is about to get married. She must go back down south to get a divorce from her old husband. Once there, she starts to rediscover her past. It is a really good movie!"
4,"Sweet, entertaing, but not an Academy Award nominee","For the small town girl who has moved to the big city, this movie reminds us all of the idealistic small town life with the small town first love. Although life doesn't also seem as sugar-coated as this film depicts, this is a nice romantic comedy for people of all ages.Reese Witherspoon effortlessly pulls off the role as the small town girl turned big city designer. Believable and fun to watch, she dazzles on the screen, as always.This is a sweet movie I can watch over and over again when looking for a light, fun movie."
5,Sweet... Cute...,Though the ending is predictable... I still believe this is a really sweet movie...All characters in the movie are funny wihtout any intention of being too silly like in a slapstick kinda movie...They are down to earth kinda people in an everyday life... not a touchy-feelin'-full of tears-love birds-soap opera-cinderella kinda movie...I like Josh Lucas a lot... =P ... he is way too cool !!!(I saw the deleted versions from the DVD... and I definitely agree with the editor's & director's choices to cut some scenes... making the movie as sweet as it is now...)
5,excellent custer service,They service that was given was very good and I am happy with my purchase I will in the future order again.
5,movie,"felt that the movie was a little slow in arriving, it arrived 8 days after the date posted online. But after it arrived the movie was in good shape and was pleased with the movie"
4,"Pretty good, actually!","I have to admit, I didn't have very high hopes for this movie when I went to se it, but I thought I would support my favorite actress. Well, I saw it and fell in love with it. The moment it came out on DVD, I bought it. very, very good movie for anyone, any age."
2,divorce in 3 years,"I thought this movie was very entertaining until the end when it totally copped out and became the dangerous propaganda that sooooo many movies pound into you. That a professional, hard-working, ambitious woman will give up everything she's worked for to have a baby and be with her man and be happy. Yuh, right. I wish these movies would show the results about 3 years down the road. This dumb idea just keeps being pushed and pushed and it just doesn't work. Babies solve nothing. And when you got a great career in New York - puh lease - baby doesn't come close."
1,Farm animals with underbites deserve each other,"Enough with Reese Witherspoon and the fascination of this ""sweetheart"". I mean, the press falls head over heels then everyone (as expected) does the same. She is Alicia Silverstone with an underbite and a kid...Sweet Home Alabama doesn't do much for Witherspoon either. She is doing well and engaged to be married with a respectful companion. But our sweetheart decides to visit the farm once more to ""tend to business"". Well then our little critter falls for her bull again...end of story. Wow, what a great positive story, eh?For those who prefer Checkers over Chess"
1,yikes yikes yikes,"what a terrible movie this was. The lady is a total fruitcake. dresses like a bimbo and doesn't really know what she wants. The 2 guys are totally crazy to fall for such a nitwit. ow yeah and than we have the part of the fo'ks at home in seet alabaaaamaaaaa. adults (xsue me, rednecks) playing wars and who hold the confedrate ideals still hiiiigh iyaaaa..Good grief what a bag of crap this is. it gets you close to vomit. this is one of the worst movies ever made."
1,disappointment,Unfortunately this was never viewed because it can only play in a certain area. I was completely unaware of such a thing ( different areas for viewing ) and no where was it stated when I purchased the item. I did contact the seller and he was willing to do something about it however I was unable to download the paperwork to complete the return. So now I am stuck with 2 vides that I can not view as I purchased one for me and one for my daughter.
2,okay passtime....,"...if you are really bored. It has a couple of good sountrack scores, but little more. Sure Reese Witherspoon is a good actress and she is sweet enough, but this movie is so boring and has cliches as far as the eye can see, so many infact that sometimes it just gets a bit humiliating...Reese, with her wonderful acting abilities can't even save it... i wouldn't really recomend this if someone was to ask me to recomend something fun or good.... it's prob okay if you are bored out of your mind and have Nothing and i do mean NOTHING else to do... i gave it 2 stars cause the acting is not too bad, the cast does an okay job, but the plot is... well it's not very good. stear clear if you don't like those cutsie, clihé movies. cause even though it may look tempting, it's one of the worst cutsi cliché movies i've ever seen."
5,The Greatest Movie I have ever seen,"this movies has it all!! romance,drama,and real life stitutions!!"
2,Rent before you buy,"I enjoy movies of this genre, but Sweet Home Alabama let me down. The cast was talented but there was so little character development and so many holes in the plot. I was disappointed because the idea had so much potential. If you want a movie about city slickers finding out they prefer the down home life try another cheesy one: Doc Hollywood...the characters are more developed, the plot makes sense, and it's still cheesy and makes you feel good! Too bad, but this one missed the mark in my book."
3,A Good Girl Flick,This is good for getting your mind off of all of the war talk! It is a fun relaxing movie and with a bowl of popcorn makes for a nice distraction.
3,Sweet Reese Witherspoon !,"A light romatic comedy. Story line is a bit weak and can I say of old fashion. Reese Witherspoon is trying hard in the movie but a lot more could be improved. I prefer her Legally Blonde instead. She could be a rising star in Hollywood if a few more good movies are done.Good to watch when you want to spend a quiet, pleasant weekend. I would give an overall B- Rating."
1,Deja vu,"Hmmmmm, seems I've seen this story before. Oh, Yeah. Doc Hollywood. The ONLY difference is ""Melanie"" was familiar with this country town. The big difference is Doc Hollywood was fun to watch. This movie is so much formula, there is not one ounce of creative juice in this flick.Yes, Reese is adorable, but that does not make a movie. The people and story were flat, predictable and of no interest. Complete waste of my time."
2,Very disappointed...,"With all the hype and somewhat interesting previews (and the simple fact that I really do enjoy Reese Witherspoon's acting), I thought it was safe to buy the DVD sight unseen! Wow...I was so disappointed in this movie! I felt that the plot was poor and lacked direction. An hour into the movie, my girlfriend and I (yes, this was our pathetic, dateless Saturday nite...haha) both looked at each other and said, ""Where is this movie going??!!"" I felt like its only redeeming quality WAS the acting, although I felt that ""Melanie"" and her husband totally lacked the romantic chemistry needed to make this movie believable. I then let my sister and her boyfriend borrow it and watch it, and guess what? They had the same opinion!! But...if you don't believe me, watch it and see for yourself! This was NOT one of Reese's best movies!!"
2,I feel sorry for the two guys,"Reese Witherspoons character is so unsympathetic and such a user that I walked away from watching this 'comedy' with kind of a sick feeling. The poor fools who are obsessed with her are handsome successful guys who could find a decent woman in a minute, but they only have eyes for the golddigging silly Reese character who treats everybody like dirt. The only thing that saves the movie is the soundtrack."
2,eh....,"Predictable, a little too cliched, and I expected better. Reese Witherspoon's charm doesn't work quite well as it did on ""Legally Blonde."" Since the synopsis is already given, there's no reason to repeat it here.I might have liked this film better had I been a 16 year old girl, but since I'm in my 20s I just expected a better storyline. Its recycled, just like 99.9% of what Hollywood dishes out. I just hope whatever film Reese stars in next, that its much better than this one."
4,I love this movie!!,"This movie was great. I love movies that I can watch over and over and over again and never get bored. There are some very funny scenes and Reese is great. The DVD doesn't have too many extras. It does have an alternate ending but it's not that great. There are no outtakes, so that's always a bummer. But, I would recommend this movie to all my friends. It does not have more than a few bad words and the content is such that the whole family can watch it. My husband even liked it, although he'll never confess such!"
3,Okay For a Back-Up...,"Okay, yes I am a guy reviewing a romantic comedy. Shame on me. Still, the movie IS a comedy, which I enjoy, so I will plunge ahead anyway, so as to help others in making a decision.Actually, it was somewhat better than I thought, and not nearly as offensive to the ""Southern Folk"" as one might suspect by looking at the title alone. I looked forward to a few good laughs, but they never came, to my disappointment. However, there were many nice scenes to make one nostalgic for younger days and old friends reluctantly left behind in our pursuit of career and fame. Anyone watching this movie will see a little of yourself in the characters and situations presented, and that aspect saved the movie for me. A bit lacking in laughs, but not at all bad for a night on the couch with popcorn in hand!"
1,Holy cow!,"Here again I am writing a review on a new movie that I wish that I could get back the two hours on my life that I wasted on this horrid film. They could have ended it about an hour into the movie. Very predictable and very boring. Please please, don't waste your time on this movie. The alternate ending was really bad and it epitomizes the rest of this very bad movie."
1,A Waste of Money,"This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The plot(country girl goes to city, gets famous, comes home to find that happiness is right there in the first place) has rust and mold on it, it's so old. The heroine is a liar and a cheat, yet once again, everything turns out all right. I usually like Witherspoon, but the close-ups of her cute ""oh don't blame me, I'm just a mixed up little girl"" face make one weary.And this woman is supposed to have become a top designer? Please! Her clothes are just awful!I can't imagine who conceived this mess, or why, and how anybody could involve themselves in making it, but most of all, what has happened to the viewing public that they seem to like it? Believe me, if you have a choice between seeing this and shoveling snow, grab the snow shovel!"
2,misleading,"After waiting a reasonalble length of time for my DVD. I was really excited aboutreceiving it. I had tried to find it locally but to no availe. When I got everything set up to watch it, much to my surprise there was a note accross thescreen stating (this product cannot be viewed in your region). Needless to sayI was disappointed, so I tried it again and the same message came up. Guess Ineed to toss this one up to experience???? It was for the DVD Sweet Home Alabama.I have not had any problems with anything else purchased from Amazon. BK"
5,classic!!!,best movie ever!!! love reese and josh's chemestry!!! best girl night movie!!! it's the best of the south in a love story!!!
5,Really Cute!,"A really cute, heartwarming movie about returning to your roots. It is sort of a chick flick, but it was really good. Reese Witherspoon is such a good actress and Josh Lucas is really loveable and hot in this. It is really cute and I felt it was worth the overpriced movie ticket price...See it!"
2,Confused and confusing,"Here Kushner sets out to make connections between Jewish mysticism (the Kabala), psychoanalysis, and dream interpretation.These are all worthy subjects of esoteric study, but he takes on more than the length or style of this book can handle, and the product in confusing and flat. What he is trying to tell the reader is in no way clear; it is almost as if this commentary on texts needs its own commentary.There is also far too much time taken linking science and the kabala. While this is a pursuit that many feel is worthy, attempts to reconcile the two almost always seem bumpy and uneven. The Kabala is myth; science is a set of empirical observations tested with a method that can be verified by others. This is like trying to compare sight with sound."
2,Charming enough film but ultimately forgettable,"Between the clunky and implausible set-up at the beginning and the mawkish and implausible wrap-up at the end, the moments in between were implausibly charming enough to keep me interested. Or maybe I just have a crush on Rachel Griffiths."
3,have I seen this before?,"The film is cute. Smacks of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" with Rachel Griffiths in her usual uplifting and inspiring role. Definitely something for us single ladies to curl up on the couch with and feel better about ourselves afterwards."
4,A little know gem,"I caught this flick on cable a few years back and it always stayed with me. So, when I found it on Amazon for only five bucks I jumped at it.The movie still holds up after all those years. Rachael Griffiths is great, and the story is timeless. It reminds me of another one of my favorites, ""The Family Man"" with Nicolas Cage.If you're in the mood for a chick flick and have run through your collection, you won't be sorry if you add this one to the bunch."
1,A Great Disappointment,"I am disappointed! This is not even a little close to the voice of Lumane Casimir in any way--very, very, very far from it. Lumane wouldn't have made an impact with such a raspy voice. In addition, the accompaniment does not evoque anything that could be compared to the typically Haitian sounds that complemented her clear and somehow piercing voice. This is not the type of sounds we knew when the great Lumane was singing. This CD is a dud. I am angry at this misrepresentation! And..so sorry I bought it. WHY NOT TRY TO REPRODUCE HER OWN RECORDINGS ON A CD?"
4,GPS Magellan Roadmate 760,"Worked well out of the box. delivery excellent. CDs and connection fineHappy with item.Has some southern Ontario missing road updates related to highways (401 and 404; Alan Expwy, others) but fine all the same.Wish the European maps were in! Greedy!Unit was bought as reburbished, and works like new.I wish it had a battery to make it REALLY useful.All functions work, and helped navigate unknown addresses with confidence and accuracy.Thanks"
2,Unsatisfied,I don't know why but when I purchased it the movie was brand new never open but it kept skipping for some reason and tried in two dvd players...so that ruined the christmas present :/
5,Arroyo's Reveiw,We all love the movie and we watch it in new year eve went the clock hit 12 am we say happy new years to each other and then we went to bed and got up and finish the movie.
4,Exciting saga continues...,We have Prancer and wanted to see the saga continue. Excited to add this to my Christmas collection of entertainment.
2,Did not like!!,It was not a good movie. Not at all like the first prancer!Would not recommend. I gave it more stars than it deserved.
3,Ok!,"I bought this movie for our family Christmas Eve present to open (new pj's, snacks & a new Christmas movie). We watched it & it was ok. It isn't one of those movies that you want to watch over & over every Christmas."
3,Prancer Returns,"A sequel to the earlier Prancer and takes place in the same town years later. A boy finds a injured reindeer and and sees it happen to be the reincarnation of Prancer and nurses it back to health.Very modern than the original,as the town folks make it a traditon to celebrate each christmas the missing reindeer from there town street display. I liked the original better as it seemed to be more grounded with the storyline. The sequel is cute too in it's own respect"
3,Prancer Returns,Background music was very annoying and overpowering making it difficult to hear the dialogue. Background music added nothing to the movie.
1,"""Son of Prancer"" Absolutely Bites","Like nearly all direct to dvd sequels made by money grubbing studios without the initiative to come up with anything new, this movie bites. It is shallow, predictable, stupid, and just generally a mess. It's about Prancer's son. It starts with the little boy finding Prancer's dead body. It's the tired old story of a kid trying to play match maker with his divorced mom. It just sucks. Save your money."
3,Not Fullscreen,"The description misleads. It says ""Fullscreen"", but it's not. It's ""Widescreen"". I might have bought it anyways, I don't know, but it should have been my choice. I prefer""Fullscreen"", but sometimes I buy ""Widescreen"" if I like the movie. Anyways like I said it should have been my choice. Amazon should put the right information in the product description. And match the right reviews to the right movie or boxed set. A lot of times there will be mixed reviews like with disney there will be masterpiece, platinum, etc., even vhs, reviews within the same movie. I have to wade through all of them just to find the ones that pertain to the movie I'm thinking of buying."
3,Prancer Returns,It was OK...the original Prancer was a lot better. Glad I bought it at reduced price. I would have hated to pay regular - full price.
4,A serious book.,"This book treats chess as treating science, just as Nimzowitch's ""My System"". It is definitely a monograph. Some definitions are given first, then some theorems (or general idea) are proved through examples and some exceptions are also shown. I don't deny it is an instructive and helpful book, but reading over 300 pages of dry words is a tantamount job to most readers. However, after reading the excellent review by other people here, I decide to give another try. The point is: study hard and dig deep!!"
3,Excellent book all about Pawns,"Pawn Power in Chess is a brilliant book with many important insights into the importance of pawns in a chess game. Warning: this book is written in descriptive notation, not algebraic. The algebraic version is apparently out of print."
5,Essential,"This book is essential for serious understanding of chess, of the 16 pieces in your army 8 are pawns. Knowing how to use them and how they can help you achieve victory is useful for any serious chess player. Get this book and improve your game. Recommended for 1600+ rated players."
2,Sort of a fun waste of time,"This book certainly contains many exercises (list-making) for someone seeking career direction; but ultimately, I learned nothing from this book about myself. I don't know if it's because it doesn't dig deeply enough, or if the approach lacks a better structure; but, it did not help with my vocational search in the least. If anything, I felt more scattered when I finished it. Disappointing :("
1,Complete waste of time!,"I concur with my fellow dutchman below: I read the Dutch translation of this book, and after finishing it, I couldn't see both the trees and the forest anymore. It is to much on detail, and lots of list making. Ultimately, I gained no understanding whatsoever from this book.If you want to read a book that does work, go for ""Do What You Are"" by Paul Tieger and Barbara Barron-Tieger. If you already know your type, you want have to fill out many lists, and they take you right to your personal strengths and weak spots, from which you can gain a sense of generic direction to take with your career."
3,FIN is the FINale!,"Perhaps the most controversial and talked about Xena episode, this finale left fans divided and outraged. You either loved it or loathed it, unless your me who liked it but didn't think it was in top ""Xena"" form. The most fun on this DVD, in my opinion, is the running commentary by producer and director Rob Tapert, the flawless Ms. Lucy Lawless, and new mama Renee O'Connor. The fun never stops listening to these three discuss their insights, short-comings, goals, and wicked senses of humor.While the plot may be out of left field (and a pop fly for many), I feel the cinematography is beautiful. Special kudos to the costumers for their vivid use colors.One thing's for sure...this show went out with a bang - a BIG bang!I'd recommend seeing it before buying it."
2,PRODUCERS... WHAT HAPPENED?,"I'm an avid Xena fan, like many of us, dissapointed with the series finale because of the consistency seeing in the whole series and such a brutal end to a hero who paid and repaid her past's sins. I bought director's cut to see what else there, there's not a lot of things but it helped to have a clearer idea of what's going on. Akemi and father little chat before Xena return, a little more chat of Xena and Akemi, why Xena cannot return to live and another dialogues and useless scenes. I'm a surprised that such a big studio as Universal didn't launch this and the other DVD set of Xena in Spanish, French, Korean, Chinese and other languages. Only in latin america, this show had big audience seeing it dubbed in spanish (me included), I speak english but many fans don't and it's a pity that the company do not release the dubbed versions in this CD and the other sets."
1,Don't watch this piece of garbage!,This episode is close to the worst episode ever. It is complete nonsense and goes against every thing that Xena stood for. If you want to see Xena hacked to death for no reason what so ever then go ahead.
3,Xena directors cut finale,"Well, the dvd itself was fairly well done, although highly scrambled which makes certain tv's go wacky, and unnessesary to keep people from copying. At any rate, The story was rediculous and it looks like they threw in an excuse to kill her off at the end almost as an afterthought. No one will say this but I will. Those ghosts deserved what they got. If the princess would have been a Prince, they would have made him a beloved hero for ridding them of such an evil tyrant. That culture treated women like cattle or slaves. They brought their fate on their own heads by trying to kill Xena when she tried to burry the girl in a decent humane way. The Xena I knew would have seen it that way too. As long as the ghost of the evil tyrant was no longer tormenting the living, then justice was done."
2,Buy only to see Renee's acting,"I've watched the series since the beginning, have every episode on tape and the show will always remain one of my favorite series. However, FIN, even with the 30-minute extra footage is still bad, barely understandable, and full of holes. Why would anyone introduce ANOTHER storyline during a series finale is beyong reason. This story could have been told eariler during the season, and the final could have been focused on Gabrielle's attempt to bring her back (successfully or unsuccessfully). But to focus on Xena's past ""crime"" in Japa and her effort to redeem herself once again is silly.Buy the DVD only to see the spectacular job that Renne O'Connor gives 110%. Gabrielle was totally believeable. Xena...that wasn't Xena. Maybe we can say it was all just a dream...."
2,Disappointing,"As an avid follower of the show for 6 seasons, the series finale was a big disappointment for me. I had seen the televised finale and was really hoping the DVD release had more scenes/dialogue to help explain away the huge and gaping plot holes. The plot remained incredibly weak, the characters are still barely recognizable, and it's just as gruesome and violent as I had remembered it! (Though there is one very slight deletion - won't give it away, but it didn't change my view.) Nothing new added in this release to lend itself to a better ending for two of my favorite TV characters.Beware if you think there is much added to what you already saw televised - you may be disappointment. Maybe if you're huge fans of the actresses, it might be worth it to you for the commentary. And if you're reading the other reviews, please note that sales of this DVD do not drive the release of the season six DVD. This is due in September timeframe I believe I read.2 stars for O'Conner though!"
1,disappointed,"hi,i did not like it,i though it should have been more about xena and gabrielle not the chinese girl.xena should not have stayed dead.for all the things xena and garielle went thru together they should have ended up together,i was disappointed.i would like to see another ending which will be the real finalle."
3,BUY THIS DVD!,"Granted, A Friend in Need was not the best 2-part Xena episode we've ever seen. But if we buy this DVD, maybe it will encourage TPTB to release what we really want -- boxed sets, or at least some of the better episodes (The Debt, A Day in the Life, Destiny, The Quest) on DVD. A message to TPTB: Buffy's 1st season boxed set is a top seller right now. This could have been Xena, if you had released it on DVD a few years ago. Release Xena boxed sets now, while Xenites are still showing enough interest in the show to spend money on it."
2,DVD poor Quality,"I am a huge fan of the show and was VERY disappointed with the quality of this DVD. This plays very poorly on a regular DVD player, but plays well on a PC. At first I thought maybe there was dirt on the DVD, but it is simply the product. Buyer Beware."
1,Xena:Warrior Princess This Is Not The End,"I Really Disliked The Series Finale. I saw it on T.V. We taped it because we were going to pick up some relitives at the airport. My sisters and I saw it a couple of days later. I cried so hard. I disliked it so much I tried to deny that it was the last episode. I decided that Xena came back to life and lived out her life happily with Gabrielle.From,Xena(Amy)P.S.We play Xena all the time.P.P.S.Xena is on (I don't know for how long) Oxygen At 8:00 to 9:00 A.M. on weekdaysP.P.P.S. We watched the Series Finale a couple days after Chirstmas"
3,Very unfortunate ending to a fantastic series,"I'm a loyal Xenite and have been for most of the series. I have seen all 134 episodes numerous times. This series finale doesn't work for me. All the special effects were fantastic. Both Lucy and Renee gave 110% to this 2 part episode. But the plot falls short of our expectations of how the series should have ended. Xena and Gabrielle should have walked off together like Hercules and Ioalus. The blame falls square on the shoulders of the Executive Producer and Lucy's husband, Rob Tapert. He made the decison to have Xena die. To die is one thing, but the way she dies is just sick. Seeing Xena beheaded is over the top. Seeing Gabrielle all alone was more than I could bear. It hurts to watch this episode. If you love Xena and Gabrielle like I do....watch ""When Fates Collide"" as your series finale. It's much easier on the heart. At the end they ride off together on the same horse."
1,A Major Catastrophe,"An incoherent, out-of-character, depressing end to a great show.Hazily pretty photography & a stand-out performance by Renee O'Connor can't make up for a story that seems to negate the previous six years. Not to mention the horrific shots of Xena's mutilated corpse & severed head.A self-indulgent finish that did not take much of the audience into account."
5,Xena For All,"If you are a long time fan or want to find out what all the noise was about...this is the DVD for you. I would have simply bought the VHS , but after having seen this version at a friend's house I went out and bought a DVD player ... well, actually a Playstation 2 ;-) ! The option to watch this epidsode along with the director and actors and hear their commentary is AMAZING ! Kinda of like watching MST3 with Rob , Lucy & Renee standing in for Joel and The Bots. Very edifying and funny too."
2,TV addition sucks,"Not only is their commercials but because of some extreme and i mean extreme violence, they cut scenes or zoomed in shots so the violence wasn't fully shown. The directors cut on the recent Xena DVD's is amazing, now the directors cut is the real deal. Not only is there no commercials, thank god, but we get to see everything. This just proves, regular TV sucks. I would really like to see Xena in Theaters in a full length movie, because if they can put that same magic that the series had into a movie, that would be something to see."
1,Not Upto Standards,"I just have a few things to say and that's all....first off if you're a new Xenite...this dvd is NOT (I repeat) NOT for you...the subject matter will be way over your head.Second,I have been a Xenite for fiveseasons...and the quality of their shows (together with the computerizedspecial effects) has been such that this dvd was a very big dissappointment.....what is a great scene if the lighting is so poor youcan't see anything without getting up close and personal with your tv?"
3,"Superfluous, only purchased BECAUSE OF AMAZON'S FLAWED & PREDATORY ITEM DESCRIPTIONS","I only BOUGHT this video BECAUSE THOUGH IT ***APPEARS*** ON THE 10TH-ANNIVERSARY ""FAN FAVE"" BOXED SET, IT IS NOT ***LISTED***, ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER EPISODES INCLUDED WITH THAT BOXED SET, *ON* THE AMAZON LISTING PAGE **FOR** THAT BOXED SET. HAD I KNOWN THAT ""A Friend In Need"" was IN THE BOXED SET, I'd never have purchased A DUPLICATE. So up yours very much, Amazon, for screwing me into buying EXTRANEOUS VIDEO.Why list samples of HALF the episodes on a boxed set, IF YOU CAN'T TELL THE CUSTOMER ***EVERYTHING*** THAT'S IN THE BOXED SET??!??!?Oh, right, 'cause y'all are AMAZON, and don't have to WORRY about ""customer satisfaction"" or ""customer service"" like A REAL BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORE WOULD HAVE, LIKE THE MILLIONS OF INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORES THAT YOU HAVE HELPED THE BIG-BOX STORES TO DESTROY."
5,About conmemtary,I was exspecting an conmentary but didn't get it. I guess just the dvd has it. Other than that loved it.
3,Disappointing and Unsatisfactory.,"I've read both the original 30 Days of Night and the first sequel Dark Days, which were both very enjoyable and entertaining. However, this sequel felt completely unnecessary. The original story was done and done, and this one added nothing at all. It's basically a repeat of the first book, with no new ideas whatsoever.I tend to think that Steve Niles' writing is serviceable at best, but this time it just didn't have anything memorable at all. Dark Days, the first sequel, actually had very memorable characters, but Return to Barrow was very blah. So yeah, going in, I didn't think the story would be great, but I really did love the art from the first two novels - this time though, it really felt like Ben Templesmith just phoned it in. Or maybe I've just grown used to Templesmith's unique style and so it isn't so original anymore. Really, it felt like both creators phoned in this unnecessary sequel. Overall, I would say skip this one."
2,let down,this book was a let bown because it was no where near as good as 30 days of night. nothing new happens.. is way to similar the the first one..
2,novelty product,"this is a novelty camera lens. It is something you would find in the ads of old mad magazines or a prank toy shop. Its fun use for a little while, but it has very little practical use in the real world."
4,"true , honest punk rock!!","This is the earliest , rawest album that social d ever recorded (before Mike Ness was writing/singing songs about ""... and when the angels sing..."" ). This is a must for any collection because this is what punk rock was about. The songs really reflect where the band was and what they were like back then . The songs on the album are written about fighting, girls , heroin , and having a F*ck you attitude towards everyone.The one and only thing I would criticise is that some of the lyrics are dated and you can tell were written when the band members were really young (for example lyrics about fighting/arguing with mom and dad about things and the lyrics to ""telling them"" and ""mommy's little monster"")but i still recommend this album"
4,The First,"It is hard to believe that Social Distortion use to sound like this. With a much more raw sound, Mommy's Little Monster (MLM) was the first of many great albums/CD's Social D. has released. AS different as they may sound, the trademark Social D. sound does come to play. Great songwriting, with superb lyrics, this early 80's album towers over many others at the time. This is truly a collectors item for any true Social Distortion fan."
5,Social D at their best,"Mommy's little monster is in my opinion, Social Distortion's greatest sound. I'm in high school and really enjoy punk music, So this CD's raw enerfy and blaring guitars is a good sound. Don't let this discourage you not to buy other CD's by them though, Because later Social Distortion isalso great, just a different, more mature sound."
2,Lacks rawness and energy...,"I had always heard Social D. on the radio for years, and I thought of them as a pretty mediocre, tame, rock band. When I found out that they had been one of the original bands in the early 80's SoCal punk scene, I eagerly bought this, their 1st album, anticipating a great punk album. I was disappointed to find that I was left with the exact same impression I had of Social D. before I bought this album: that they lacked a certain ""punk"" energy and rawness so apparant in the sound of their early contemporaries (i.e. Black Flag). As a ""rock"" album, this holds up pretty well, but I don't recommend this if you're looking for a really good punk album."
5,MOMMYS LITTLE MONSTER,"THIS CD [IS GREAT],I WAS LUCKY ,I LIVED IN FULLERTON IN MY YOUTH AND SAW SOCIAL DISTORTION ALOT IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN SOCIAL DISTORTION YOU SHOULD, IT WILL PROBLEY CHANGE YOUR LIFE BUT THE LYRICS ON MLM ARE GREAT THEY TALK ABOUT NOT FITTING IN ,IN ORANGE COUNTY IN THE 80'S ,HOW PEOPLE TREATED YOU DIFFRENT BECOUSE OF THE MUSIC YOU LISTED TO OR HOW YOU DRESSED EVERY CD THEY PUT OUT IS GREAT BUT THIS ONE IS THE BEST,SO IF YOU KIDS OUT THERE THAT LISTEN TO THE ""NEW POP PUNK BANDS""REALY NEED TO PICK THIS ONE UP .AFTER ALL BACK THEN PUNK MUSIC WAS LOOKED DOWN ON IT WAS HARD TO KEEP CLUBS OPEN AND WE REALY HAD TO FIGHT TO KEEP THE MUSIC GOING, SO BUY THIS CD NOW AND SHARE IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS,AND THE NEXT TIME THERE ON TOUR GO SEE THEM EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO DRIVE 50 MILES IT IS WELL WORTH IT ,SEE YA AT THE SHOW."
4,Troy,"I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read difficult books, because this book is full of big words. Or anyone who likes war, the book has alot to do with that. But the biggest reason to read this book is if you like and secretly raised him. Paris awarded Aphordite the golden apple and in return she made him invincible in love. The Trojans started a war with the Greeks, But eventually they called a truth. Of course it was broken and the war started up again. At first I didn't really like it but as it went on I did. By the end of the book i thought it was a really good. Like the newborn left to die i didn't like that. But when the war started and the action I liked it then. Another reason I liked it was that it had a big picture on every other page. Over all it was a good book and if I were you I would read this book."
1,Not appropriate for grade schoolers,"My 11-year-old son brought this book home from the grade school library and, upon first glance, I thought it would be an interesting book. However, as I flipped through the book and saw the newspaper clippings the other reviewers mentioned, I was somewhat startled. Some of them read: ""Japan Admits WWII Use of Sex Slaves,"" ""War Protester Burns Herself To Death Here,"" and ""Newborn Found in Dumpster."" There were several other, similar articles. This may be fine for young adults of junior high age or higher, but not for grade school kids."
5,Perfect!,This dish is perfect for stuffing 12 escargots without their shells. I have no difficulty placing 2 pieces in each pocket and still have just enough melted butter for dipping. I am very pleased with this purchase.
2,Too Small,"The little cups are very shallow and I felt not deep enough to hold anything of any size. I wanteed to make ""shrimpcargo"" and didn't think that the shallow cups would hold enough butter sauce or even a small shrimp."
4,Nice but not great with only 7 songs (!?),"As a long time fan of Chieli Minucci and Special EFX I was eager to purchase and watch/listen to this DVD. I have been listening to Chieli, George (rest in peace) and the group since the 80's.First, the good: Chieli's guitar playing is as good as ever; the supporting cast is also very good; and, the DVD contains some of my favorites.The not so good: video quality was not as sharp as other DVD muscic productions; audio quality was somewhat muted; and, more importantly, the DVD only has 7 songs(!). Chieli has an extensive library of music (over 17 CDs), why limit this effort to just 7 songs and 60 minutes? At the end of the day, I was left wishing for more.All in all, if you are a Minucci and Speciall EFX fan, this is a nice to have DVD. I'm sorry to say that it is not a ""must have"" item."
5,smoooooth,"Chieli is absolutely my favorite guitar player - and he is awesome on this disc. More songs would be nice, but the quality of the music and video make up for that many times over. Chieli is under-rated, if more people saw this disc they would see how good he really is. I love this one and look forward to the next one!"
2,Tin Tin Review,"I didn't understand the the cd was in high definition format. I have no player for it, and it sounds awful... However, I expect to go high def soon, and am looking forward to hearing Toast And Marmalade for Tea soon."
2,Not up to the standard I had come to expect from Ott-Lite company,"I own seven other versions of Ott-Lite lamps, three floor lamps and four table lamps. I really like the Ott-lite lamps I have purchased to date and have recommended them to family and friends. This is the first of the Ott-lite products that has disappointed me. The metal base is very scratched and unattractive. A small screw that was included to secure the bulb housing to the L-shaped portion of the shaft does not fit the hole. Consequently the bulb housing is very wobbly and makes the entire lamp feel cheap. Also, the type of bulb supplied with this model wasn't what I was expecting. It is the coil-type of fluorescent bulb that has a tendency to buzz and, yes, this one buzzes very loudly. I will not recommend this version of an Ott-lite lamp to anyone at any price."
5,Wonderful (all of it),"Most of the traks in this album are traditional napolitan songs, others are modern and well known in Italy. Je Sto' Vicino A Te and Quanno Chiove are among the most beatiful songs written by the great Pino Daniele in the 80s. Napoli is the most jazzed up Mina's album I have heard, the traks are just beautiful, and so she is. Napoli, Ti Conosco Mascherina and Uiallalla are the Mina's albums that won't disappoint listeners with fine taste."
5,GETTING IT DONE,I never used it as Quest phone service had hidden charges for high speed so I never hooked it up for service. I can say that if Amazon has to use UPS again though then I would not order anything from them as UPS makes sure that I am the last one to receive the shipment for the day and although I had two day shipping it was on the third day of the work week that I got it at 7:00PM. I called Amazon several times about UPS but they said that they could not ship FedX.
1,dont buy,Doesnt live up to billing regarding picture quality. Grainy. I expected a lot more. Subject matter boring. Wouldnt buy again. Stay away from this whole series. I bought others and all the same
5,The greatest of Southern writers at her best,"Eudora Welty is unmatched as a short story writer. She can touch your heart and in her comic stories, she is screamingly funny. How can you love American literature and not be a fan of Eudora Welty's? You can't!!"
4,Essential supplemental reading,"For anybody reading The Help, or attempting to understand the rural south. There's not a moment of her sharp mind's flow not like the best prose--beautiful words and vivid visual pictures. She's such a quality writer. I left her book feeling quiet and richer."
2,Like a jigsaw puzzle.....,"This book has, so far, been a disappointment. The stories seem to ramble, disconnected. I have enjoyed other books by Ms. Welty, but will research content more indepth prior to purchase next one."
4,A wonderful book,Ms. Welty is an example of not just southern writers but history as well. An reader would be smart to read her works.
2,Couldn't Finish It,"Although I enjoyed the beauty in much of the writing, I just couldn't force myself to finish it. I often read before I go to sleep, and this book put me to sleep."
5,Excellent!,"I fell in love with ""Muriel"" when I first saw it and now I have the DVD. Excellent movie, well-written and acted. I love the bittersweet taste it leaves behind and I think the film is a major success for Toni Collette. Love her!"
4,Muriel--a classic character,"Have you watched this movie and feel as though Muriel is a real person lurking around somewhere? Maybe even inside yourself.THis movie is hilarious and touching. Everyone in the movie is a tragic, really. But that's okay. THey're just human. Muriel does make us want to laugh and cry with her. Toni Colette is a great actress--I hope she takes over USA, which she's starting to with her Oscar nomination in ""The Sixth Sense"". Muriel's mom depressed the hell out of me--her husband cheating on her, no one helping her, and eventually she loses her mind and kills herself. She was the most real character next to Muriel. Great performance.Every scene is a favorite. I can't stop watching it."
3,Not So Great,"I accidentally got this movie from my library instead of ""Rachel Getting Married"". Since I'm a fan of Toni Collette, and the DVD cover was filled with blurbs about how great this movie was, I watched it. I didn't find it ""Hysterically Funny!"" nor would I give it ""Two Thumbs Up!"" It also didn't make me want to ""stand up and cheer!"" Maybe if I'd seen the movie in the actual 90s when it came out, I may have viewed it differently. There seemed to be a disconnect between the story lines and the characters and their reactions. Subjects like divorce, cancer, and suicide are glossed over, and how can their inclusion make a movie 'hysterically funny'? It was odd. I also had a hard time understanding some of what they said because of all the Australian accents. There are much better Toni Collette movies out there. And I hope ""Rachel Getting Married"" is better."
5,WONDERFULL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a wonderful film. A feel good movie, but not in the way you would think. If I had to give up all my movies, and keep only one, It would be this one. It will make you laugh, cry, and be sentimental all in a period of 90 minutes! A keeper. The soundtrack is perfect! Anyone who has been the ""ugly duckling"" this film is a gem. I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,One star is not low enough,"In a long history of tortuous ""chick-flicks"" this one has got to be the most unbearable by far. There is not one single redeeming morsel to hang onto from this waste of time. Fat, ugly, loser from a loser family in a loser town hopes to get the guy? Please! I wouldn't even hook up with this girl if she was the last female standing at a frat party.This is the movie to show Osama Bin Laden's henchmen to make them choke up his whereabouts. I would hand over my own mother to keep from having to watch even one more second of this chick-flick black hole.Please stop watching this movie so they will stop printing it."
1,Definitely not a comedy!,"My wife got this movie at our local library believing that it was a comedy.Usually the ""movie reviews"" included in the DVD covers are a little bit misleading, but this one gets the prize!According to US Magazine this movie is ""hysterically funny"". Oh yeah...""funeral funny"" I would say! The Los Angeles Times says that it ""makes audiences want to stand up and cheer"". I didn't know that ""scream and break the DVD in half"" was a synonymous for ""cheer""!I think the only ones having fun with this movie are the folks from the marketing department at Miramax by labeling a boring melodramatic drama as a ""hilarious comedy about friends, fun and expected surprise""!At least I didn't pay a penny for this garbage, but the Australian tax payers did..."
2,Muriel's dysfunctional life,"This film was first brought to my attention in a crash course on Australian films. I have a lot of trouble calling this a comedy because of the tragic overtones. In a classical sense it is a comedy because it starts out with a conflict and ends happily. Overall the tragic and sad scenes overwhelms the comic aspects. Muriel's family could hardly be any more dysfunctional if they tried and for much of the movie Muriel's main obsession is to get married and after she does, she realizes how silly it was. I like her confronting her family and fake friends, but I would have trouble recomending this movie to many people. Yes there are many comic scenes like Muriel's mother getting tired of telling her son to mow the backyard and torching it, but overall it isn't the comedy it claims to be."
2,Boring,This movie intersperses prolonged and whiney ugly duckling boredom with an occasional humorous scene. Certainly not as good an Austrailian comedy as Ballroom Dancing.
2,Fairly disjointed adolescent movie making,"to be fair, so i saw this on the heels of watching ""goodfellas"", perhaps one of the best directed films in recent memory. i would say if you are a person who gets easily absorbed in character as opposed to technique, than you may enjoy this movie. though it need be said that some of the characters are so highly clichéd (the circle of girlfriends...for example) that it might be hard to appreciate their subtleties if one is not from Australia.For me, this genre (pathetic, black socio-familial comedy) was accomplished better with films like ""welcome to the dollhouse"", ""happiness"", and ""life is sweet"". The movie was too broad in plot and setting and very hackneyed in its transitions. (as in when the heroine runs off with her friend at the end). And the device of her mother's death as a transition point was done ever so lamely. She just wanders around in a daze and then...poof...wakes up.Not a film geek flick by any stretch. But my girlfriend loves it."
1,Worst - Movie - Ever!!,"If it wasn't for a bet that I had going with a friend, I never would have spent the $3.50 to buy this movie. It was simply awful! I understand the story line and that it's meant to be a comedy, but please don't show this to young girls as they may get the wrong idea. I think giving it an ""R"" rating will help ensure that young, impressionable girls WON'T see this movie. The only two funny scenes in the entire movie are when Muriel and Rhonda are on vacation and singing Waterloo in a talent show, and when Muriel is walking down the isle to get married, and the song ""I Do"" is playing as her wedding march. Seemed fitting.Recap: Don't waste your money.As for the bet - Which movie better represent Abba music. Mama Mia wins by a landslide!"
1,The Worst Movie Ever,"This movie was intentionally created to be funny, but to me, it was a major flop. The storyline was extremely unrealistic, and the actors were the worst I've seen. If you have any common sense, do not even rent this movie, let alone buy it."
4,"Worst Movie ever? NOT! Come on, this is Outrageously Funny.","This is an Australian film, so the comedy is not for everyone. But I have to say the the bean bag scene is one of the funniest in film, and I still laugh thinking about it."
3,Muriel is Wonderful,"Toni Collette is amazing as Muriel Heslop, an outcast from a very broken family. She ventues out into her own life away, but can't get away from her strongest desire - to have her own wedding, a confirmation that she is loveable. She is loveable as are the other fully developped characters in the film. The DVD is serviceable, and it was a nice change to have it available in widescreen. I only wish that it were anamorphically enhanced, or that more special features were available. However, since I've played this disc many times since getting it, the film certainly helps buffer where the disc may be lacking."
3,Tragic Comedy,Muriels wedding is another great Australian film that could have been just another comedy film. Underlying the fun is the tragic story of Muriels family and her attempts to rise above it. The sound track is great so buy that too.
5,This is a terrifically funny and touching movie. A must !,I have watched this movie several times. It's the kind of movie that is even better the second time that you see it. I would highly recommend this movie to teenagers and adults.
4,Enhanced for widescreen?,"I ordered the 2011 version thinking the later release would be enhanced for widescreen TVs, but the dvd I got was the version that is not enhanced so the picture is in a small rectangle in the middle of my TV. Very disappointing. I don't know if I got the wrong version as there is no marking on the box to indicate whether it is the 2011 release or an earlier one. If someone has the 2011 release, and a widescreen TV, please note in a review if the picture plays as it should. If it does, sell it to me! I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and still have the VHS in full screen. Would love to update to widescreen dvd."
4,"Not my thing, but I still enjoyed it.","I bought this for my wife and watched it with her. I expected to hate it, but didnt. It's actually pretty well done and has some really funny scenes. You could do a lot worse for a so-called ""chick flick"".'Nuff said."
5,Hilarious fun!,"This movie combines the brutal honesty of being different with the very celebration of it. The music (predominantly ABBA) brings us, as an audience, up and down the emotional scale. We feel for Muriel, cheer her on, and admonish her at the same time. Muriel's Wedding is on my list of the best chick flicks out there."
4,An uplifting tragi-comedy,"It is a distinct characteristic of Australian new wave cinema that it can deliver this unusual melange of comedy and tragedy with an uplifting final inspirational message. Against a backdrop of family dysfunction featuring a philandering small town politican as a father, a chronically depressed mother, and emotionally incapacitated siblings, Muriel temporarily escapes the clutches of her suffocating existence in Porpoise Spit. It is only after she returns, when her mother is driven to a thinly veiled suicide, that Muriel musters the will to shake off both her father's grip and her marriage of convenience to a glamorous South African champion swimmer. The sense of irony and palpable closeness you feel to the characters coupled with several insertions of music from ABBA ensure that this movie lapses neither into slapstick nor dark comedy. A true Australian cinematic gem!"
5,Aussie chicks rule,Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths and ABBA and a great ensemble cast have fun with a great script. Love it!
2,Too unpleasant,"I confess that I couldn't watch the movie for more than the first 30 minutes and then bits and pieces from later portions. The part i watched deserved one star but, to give the movie the benefit of the doubt, i made it 2 stars.The reason i couldn't go on watching was that this ""comedy"" was too painful for me. Here's a homely, overweight, dismally stupid young woman. She can't help that, admittedly. But she is also lazy, dishonest, and irresponsible, and, despite her resolutions, does not reform her ways.I did not find it amusing, and i did not find her girl friends amusing either."
3,Funny but silly!,A funny movie but also very silly and I had hoped to see more of Queensland which the movie did not show. Not a movie I would watch a second time.
3,Its fine,"I purchased this set because normally it would be 70-80 in the store. And here i only paid i think it was 14. The only thing that was disappointing was the case, it wouldn't stay on the phone."
2,Not the Sam I heard,"I never heard of Sam Brown until I saw her on ""Concert for George,"" headed up by Eric Clapton. Sam sang a killer song, ""You can lead a horse to water..."". I loved it. So I ordered this album. I wanted more of what I heard in that concert, and sad to say, this wasn't it. I still think she has a terrific voice, but I didn't care for the songs or the arrangements in this album."
1,Misleading title,"While the title The Winter Wilderness Companion is accurate, the sub heading of Traditional and Native American Skills for the Undiscovered Season is the part I found misleading(after I purchased the book of course).I had expected the book to be more along the line of The Indian Tipi or American Indian Archery written by Reginald and Gladys Laubin(both five star books in my view). Not even close. Info on EPIRBS and contact info for LL Bean and Steger Mukluks wasn't what I wanted in a book with this title.Although there is useful winter camping information it falls into the elementary catagory and group travel sounds like the old British Himalayan expedition style. If you read any Bonnington pulp you'll know what I mean.Anyway this is just one New England winter travelers opinion.Its your plastic, but I'd spend my $14 elsewhere."
5,great band,"I follow them since Ravenheart. I pretty much like female vocals, and I can tell that this german band made a great record. Each album they release, they improve the maturity of their composition.Even Lisa (former vocal that recorded this CD) as Krestin (nowadays) have two great voices.They are out of print here, And I bought it along with Kill the Sun (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008Y4RI/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title) - their first record."
3,BCL10102011,"Well written book but hardly a biography, more a summary of the Civil War and Stanton's role as secretary of war."
4,Good but not Great!,"The lights look really good mounted on my 2012 Wrangler with the Mopar windshield mounts. But, while putting on the wire loom to cover the wires and connectors that come directly from the spotlights one off the butt connectors pulled off with very little pressure. I look at it and it was barely crimped where it was supposed to be attached to the positive wire. Quality and control dropped the ball on this one!"
5,they look great and shine on down the way,The 8 inch diameter looks great and fills the void in the grill guard. They have a very long range.
5,terrific review book,"This book has been a terrific review of algebra. I did very well in math in high school and college, but since that was almost 10 years ago, I need a quick review. The authors have created a manual that is detailed enough to provide thorough explanations yet succinct enough to allow a quick trip through the book. The writing is straighforward, adding to the ease of study. Highly recommended."
2,Probably not the best review book,"This is not the most user friendly review book. I found numerous print errors that caused a great deal of confusion in working through some of the exercises. Some functions are shown in great step by step detail, but other sections skip over crucial steps without explanations. A revision from the publisher is greatly needed."
4,Wtf? Prerelease?,"Well, honestly, I don't know what's going on. The record label's website shows no information about this cd or even as an upcoming release. I brought it today, Dec. 17th, 2005. The release date is Jan. 10th, 2006. FYE had two copies, and I was returning a FOB CD I already had and was going to exchange it for another, but I looked at the section anyways. New CD? When did it come out?! Oh... That's weird, it seems like it's not even supposed to exist.Anyways, it's a GREAT CD. I think it can be done a little better, but it'd be difficult. If you love Fall Out Boy and strings, buy this cd. Why the hell does FYE have the cd 4 weeks before it's released? (I'm assuming it came in Tuesday the 13th.)To write your review before the review option is available or before this cd is released, go to -http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/write-a-review.html/ref=cm_rev_write_2/102-2022526-4447331?asin=B000BSZA3I&store;=musicIt's really easy to crack URLs.- Lifsun6"
1,YUCK!,"HAS TWO TIMES THE FILLING OF FIG NEWTONS WHICH MAKES THEM TOO GOOEY AND STICK TOGETHER. HAVE PURCHASED BARBARA;S PRODUCTS BEFORE AND LIKED THEM, BUT WOULD NOT BUY THE BLUEBERRY BARS AGAIN. TASTE AWFUL."
1,DO NOT BUY!,Absolutely TERRIBLE quality. DO NOT BUY. I was 100% dissatisfied with the product! And Amazon does NOT stand by its food sales and offer refunds (unlike my brick & mortar grocery store). Item was past date & Amazon offers NO returns on grocery; TERRIBLE!
1,Buyer Beware--I got screwed,"Why can't I give this a negative amount of stars???I love these cookies and have bought them from Amazon before. The expiration date was always just a few months away--but I love them and had no problem eating all six packages in a short time.This time, I got my shipment May 2009 and the cookies all had a ""best used by March 09"" date on them. So....Amazon has now sunk to shipping goods past their expiration date. I haven't eaten any of them yet---I kind of turned off by the idea they are two month beyond the date they should be taken off the shelf.I will never buy these from Amazon again unless Amazon can assure me the product will be fresh."
5,Organic Wigs,"I bought 238 Barbara's Bakery Low Fat Traditional Blueberry Bars, 12-Ounce Boxes for my pet green iguana. Unfortunately, he died as a result from too much grease intake a few weeks before. So I was stuck with the 238 Boxes.Blueberry is not my favorite but these are really fresh, good and tasty. They are sweet and taste natural. Very good product.My neighbor, Halbert, who is part of the fat acceptance movement, invited himself over to eat them since they expire in 3 months. He clocks in at 560 lbs. He comes over to watch TV and eat these, imposing himself upon my company, which is annoying.So far, no complaints and he has gas problems, which I found out. The organic figs help him out I think. Hopefully he'll finish eating them soon so he can stop bothering me."
1,did not like at all,our family did not leke thast at all. Din not atst lke figs. They were sweet enough but tasted like purnes.
1,expired date twice!,"I actually love this product. Because I can't have sugar, I have to seek out products like Barbara's sugar free/fruit only fig/blueberry bars.The only problem is that the expiration date on this product was Jan 9 2008, and this product was sent to me in March 2008. When I asked for another batch with a later expiration date, I was sent another 6 boxesin April with the same Jan 9 2008 date.Get with it Amazon, that's not okay..... The product gets noticably goeyand is not a firm cookie past the expiration date. I really wanted thisproduct, but had to ask for my money back due to this expiration date problem. Amazon gave me a $10 coupon for other Amazon products,but no cookies. Oh well, I guess I'll loose a few pounds...."
5,Yummy!,"These fig bars are naturally sweet and so tastey. My whole family just loves them and they are a healthy, nutritious snack which is great, too. These are a very moist cookie with a great blueberry taste, by far our favorite of the Barbara's Fig bars although we really like the Raspberry ones too."
2,"Was good, now not",I was having 2 or 3 cookies everyday for the longest time. They were pretty good tasting and a healthy alternative to other cookies. Something has changed recently. They're not the same. The recipe has changed or the baking process or both. I'm pissed.
4,Addictive - beware of sugar.,"Funny how this product seems so polarizing. I dislike Fig Newtons but love these bars' true-fruit sweetness and gooey density. Some bars do stick together. The filling is by no means hard to chew or gigantic, though, as some reviewers have oddly implied. If freshness was ever a problem, it may have been corrected: the shipment I got was several months before the expiration date.My only qualm: though naturally sweetened, each piece contains 8g sugar. The serving size of 2 bars is more filling than you'd expect, but if eaten as a quick breakfast or even lasting snack you'd need at least 4 -- for 32g sugar. ""Natural"" or not that's too much sugar."
1,Way too sweet,"We love fig bars and wanted more natural option than grocery store. But these are not edible, even my toddler won't eat them because they are just too sweet."
2,"Taste is ""OK""","Buyer Beware: I ordered this product 4-11-08 (rcvd it promptly) and the expiration date is 7-7-08. I'm a single gal - so that means I'd have to chow down 2 of these packages each month just to consume them before they expire.For the health concious - these are fruit juice sweetened which means no white sugar is added! They are 60 calories per cookie with 13g of carbs, 1g Fiber, 8g sugar, and 1g of protein.I had to leave a rating of only 2 because of the taste - just ""ok"" for me. They have a very heavy flavour almost a slight fermented after taste to them. If you're a die hard fig lover, these might be for you but I personally prefer the whole wheat version by Nabisco"
3,can take 'em or leave 'em,"These cookie bars are good for a wheat-free alternative, but as far as overall taste goes I can take them or leave them. However, my husband and 3 boys do not go for these at all."
5,Barbara's Bakery Fig Bar's Multigran,"Barbara's are Best Fig Bars made. We have been purchasing a case of 6, every month for over three years. We have tried the many others, none compare. This is the first time we bought them on Amazon. The service was wonderful."
1,Only Wheel in Town,"The Panasonic Remote Control 1839447 has a design flaw such that it stops working after about a year's use. Unfortunately, it is the only remote that works with the PV-HS2000, so there's no alternative. I have had to replace the remote twice."
1,Too basic,"I couldn't figure out if this book was written for kids or for adults: If it's for kids, it should have more pictures. If it's for adults it's way too basic!! I don't recommend it to anyone!"
2,"Lovely, But.................................!!!!","This is one of the prettiest stained glass panels I have ever seen........................BUT, it arrived broken twice and Amazon refuses to ship again!!!! I firmly believe they were broken at the point of origin since the outside boxes were intact and the inside boxes were damaged at the point of breaks in the panel. Too bad PemAmerica doesn't check them prior to shipping and pack them better!!!! I would not recommend ordering because you will be very upset to find this beautiful piece that you will never own!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Beautiful but broken!,"Thought I'd take a chance despite the other reviews. The panel is large, beautiful and like the others, broken in 6 places. Very upsetting . . . I have the perfect window waiting for that stained glass panel. I'm going to give them one more chance to get it right.Well, I gave them 2 more chances to get it right. Went from 6 to 4 to 2 broken areas of the panel. I give up! It's too bad the manufacturer did not take the time to package this beautiful panel better and invest in more bubble wrap and a few more ""fragile"" stickers."
3,Beautiful but cracked,"This is a beautiful stained glass item, but it arrived with many small cracks that were very visible. I had to get some fake ""lead"" strips to fix them, and there are still more that I couldnt hide.I saw this same piece at Overstock, after my purchase, and if I had known that I would get a cracked one, I would have ordered from them. There were several reviews of this piece already at Amazon, saying that the piece had arrived cracked, but I figured that I would get one anyway, since surely they couldnt all be cracked! Well, I was wrong, it seems that they all are."
1,Item was broken twice,"I really liked the stained glass, but the first one I received was cracked, I returned it and received it and it too was cracked. I was refunded my money but was charged $16 for a restock fee. I would like to have had the stained glass, but it seems they cannot be shipped without being broken and I don't think I should have been charged the restock fee."
3,Cracked in 5 places but beautiful,"Happy with the piece but it came cracked in 5 places: packaged in just a card board box with bubble wrap. I ordered the other one, too ""dragonflies"" and it was also cracked in 5 places. i fixed it by purchasing some ""fake lead"" from the craft store (made by ""Gallery Glass"") and patched it up. I didn't return them because it wasn't worth it and for that price, I expected them to be cracked."
2,Broken! Not just cracked but broken!,"Broken! Not just cracked but broken!I thought a few cracks I could live with, but this was broken.Disappointed in Michigan,"
2,What a movie!!!,"I borrowed this movie from a friend who rented it, and thought it was as hilarious as he did! The reason I gave it two stars was because it was so corny that is was funny. The toilet scene was classic, and definitely gives a new meaning to the word, flatulation. I was cracking up! The plot of the movie is supposed to be serious, but the acting was really bad, so bad that you couldn't help but laugh at most of the movie. And the action sequences, when they have a punch or a kick repeated three times, is a riot as well! I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie that is so bad, that it is funny. If the movie was rated on making you laugh, I would have given this four or five stars, but since it is supposed to be serious, I would have to give it 2 stars. Anyway, if you want a good laugh, go to your local Hollywood or Blockbuster and rent this, I guarantee you will be laughing out loud! :)"
1,WARNING! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.,"This by far has to be the dumbest $%@& movie on EARTH. I saw this movie and as soon as I heard them chanting ""black ninja, black ninja"" and saw that idiotic costume, I turned it off. But my friend insisted on watching the whole thing. OMG!!! First off the plot doesn't make any sense what's so ever. Second, every time I hear them chanting ""black ninja, black ninja"" it just kills my nerves. And would someone PLEASE tell me why he is fights his own clients. This movie does not deserve a one or a zero, I just wish I could award a -1."
1,"The first reviewer is right. ""Don't let the cover fool you""","I rented this film (thank god I rented it!!!) thinking that it would be the next Black Mask or the next Revenge of the Ninja, but it turns out that is a stupid poor productions with ""home cameras"", HORRIBLE fight choreogrhapic,FATAL acting and in each fight there is a background music singing ""Black Ninja"" in Rap mode.This is the worst ninja movie ever because every scenes are copies of Batman and some Sonny Chiba's classic movies, I prefer to watch Batman of the 70's than this garbage.P.S: THANK GOD I RENTED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,DON'T LET THE COVER FOOL YOU!!,"This movie didn't even rate 1/2 of a star. I'm big on ninja flicks and this movie was a joke. The ""black ninja"" was a defense attorney who fights his clients at night. It just doesn't make any sense!"
5,A Sweet Tale,"This endearing story about Marley and his friends brings to mind stories of yesterday, of sitting on Grandpa's lap by the fireplace and listening to tales of friendship and love. I must say, I enjoy reading this book to my young children. I cherish the opportunity to teach them about the values of kindness, friendship, and cooperation portrayed by the animal characters. It is a lovely way to teach children that all creatures are special and that God has given everyone talents that are unique and valuable."
5,Fun and Daring,"...This book is a quick and easy read while at the same time, captivating and provacative. It's a meaningful read for women who struggle with maternal instincts and love juxtaposed against the often-unpleasant realities that make having a child seem impossible in today's world. As the mystery unfolds, it is both fascinating and horrifying to look at how embedded we can become in our own hypocritical way of thinking! It weaves throughout the undeniable vulnerability and duality that exists in all of us. For those who dare to think or look at themselves, while also enjoying reading, this is the book!..."
2,I'm Underwhelmed,"If I were Mr. Shapiro, I'd be embarassed to acknowledge my association with this book, much less do a book tour. The characters are stiff, cardboard caricatures of standard poorly-written novels. The short chapters contribute to a feeling of plot movement, but leave one wondering about true plot development. Background on the RU drug was interesting. The typos were numerous: aquittal, for one. Some situations were tritely absurd and the dialogue suffered. Sorry to say, Mr. Shapiro does better in the courtroom (how much of this book is attributed to him?)"
2,Not Bad for a first novel,"The book was interesting but I was kind of disappointed that it was not really about a mans ""right to choose"", as you knew the main character was being portrayed as a ""good"" guy who had strayed. The promo on tv by Mr. Shapiro led me to believe the Mans choice thing would be more evident. Otherwise it was an interesting book. The point of view was kind of expected."
5,Dre and Snoop control the mic!,"I haven't even heard of this album but ""Deep Cover"" is the best rap song ever!! Yeah and ya don't stop/cause it's 187 on a unda' cover cop"
2,Not worth buying,"This is simply a collection of some of Dr Dre's earlier songs which he either produced or rapped on (aside from ""Nickel Slick Nigga"" by Kokane which appears on this cd for no reason since Dr. Dre neither raps on it or produces it). I actually do own this album, and it is definetly not worth buying. There are 2 great tracks, ""Deep Cover"" and ""Bridgette"", and one mediocre track, ""Nickel Slick Nigga"", but other than that, this album is COMPLETE garbage. As a previous reviewer stated, the rest of the tracks sound more like techno as opposed to rap. Download those 3 tracks, but leave this album on the shelve."
4,Stuff you never learned in High School,a good read for anybody interested in the US's breif involvement in Cambodia during the Vietnam conflict. Detailed and informative.
3,Almost But Not Quite,"(Spoiler Alert) Although it was a good idea to make a film about Lapu-Lapu, the film didn't quite meet my expectations. The set, location, cast and production team did a good job, but more research needed to be done, and the dearth in historical accuracy gravely affected the film's authenticity. Realistic means of communication were sacrificed for dramatic effects. For instance, the Spanish came in with cannons ablaze, causing natives on the beach to scatter in panic. Yet, in the next scene, they are shown calmly standing on the beach, waiting for the Spaniards to disembark, and readily accepting the latter's statement of friendly intentions, with no sign of outrage or hostility upon being fired upon with huge cannons. That being said, the film seemed well-intentioned, and is a good start for better future historical endeavors."
3,"Bit over rated, a lot retro.","I bought this one because of the single ""Are you gonna be my girl"", good one for the radio. The whole album it is a copy of The Who, The Rolling Stones and The Beatles. If you are into late 60's music, you will find some riffs that will sound very familiar. If you are not, and you like this album, you better hear the real sound of that time, at least all of them were original at that time."
3,Jet's okay.,"I love Are You Gonna Be My Girl..that's the best song on this CD. But after that, it starts sounding repetitive. I could barely tell one song from another. It was just okay."
3,Worth stealing,"The album is actually pretty good. But since they're so blatant about ripping riffs from other artists, I decided to get a burned copy from a friend rather than purchase it. I mean, why pay for what's already stolen?"
2,"I have no idea what's goin' on here,","I kinda liked Jet when I heard their Cold Hard .... song. But personally, I don't like the fact that these guys are so banal ALL the TIME. I read an interview of them, and they sure seem to be lovin' the rock star style, with all their women and drugs. Well, good for you guys. But here's a tip. Next time, at least create music that deserves that lifestyle, and not the same song on every track. I seriously thought my player was skipping like mad, everything sounded regurgitated. All I'll give them is that they can play good (and that's mostly because the licks were borrowed from old masters.) But then again, I know 10 year olds that can play Stairway to Heaven. So try a little harder, guys, and maybe I'll have a listen, but for now, I think I'll stick to something a little more authentic."
3,Not all that bad,"I'd really like to give it 3.5 stars... I love the hits ColdHeart B!tch and Are you gunna be my girl(even though they stoleit) and Rollover DJ. The rest is decent or filler. It's apretty good start, but they need to do better."
3,"Yeah, so?","Thee are 3 schools of classic rock-those that dig the 50's innovators, those that dig the""fine musicians"" of progressive rock, and those that think AC/DC was so much better than Led Zeppelin it's not funny, 'cause they didn't screw around. If you are in this 3rd group, buy this damn album. It'a somewhat manufactured, but if they deliver what you want, who cares? You have to buy SOMETHING between Hives releases!"
2,This is a ?????????? rock band,"If you heard 'Are you gonna be my girl' and thought this was another garage rock band you are so wrong.They are somewhere in beween Garage Rock and Soft Rock/Pop and are pretty bad at both styles, either way, if you want the former, get White Stripes, Strokes or Mars Volta, and if you want the latter you better get some Oasis, Travis or Coldplay.BTW 'Come around again' and 'Move On' are both lame Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here rip offs."
3,Overall not bad,"Falls into the catagory of the White Stripes, The Strokes ect. except with a little more edge. The Album as a whole, doesn't quite have enough additude for my taste, but Cold Hard B**** is a very good song. Too bad they didn't follow its lead with the rest of the album.From a objective viewpoint, this is a very good album for those into the sound."
4,Look What You've Done,"This album was a big suprise. In a world filled with Hives, Strokes, and White Stripes...you wouldn't think a really good band sort of like that rying to revive old school rock and roll would come along and be really really good, but this one did. This album is filled with catchy tracks reminicent of the Rolling Stones, Led Zepplin, and the Who.I would say, check them out before you throw them in the (those damn ""the"" bands (even though they aren't the) categorie. These are some really good songs. I gave it only four stars because the album is pretty short and there are maybe two tracks that don't really stand out. But four is an ""excellent"" rating according to me (5 being perfect) and this is really truly excellent! Throw away the icesty whie stripes and those poisonous hives and Get Born!"
1,The record companies wet dream....,"....a Strokes clone with more ""edge"". A more accessible ""Strokes"". Pathetic. How much would you like to bet that these guys were playing grunge 8 years ago and nu metal or pop punk 4 years ago? STARTILINGLY unorginal and uninteresting. A ""Strokes"" for the middle American bar crowd. Man do I despise bands like this. This is the kind of crap Creed fans would buy to say that they have ""diverse"" musical tastes!!! LOL!! : )"
2,This CD is way overrated by most,"I read a fair sampling of the reviews here and decided to take a chance on this CD because most seem to be solid four and five star reviews. Boy, did I make a mistake!!! There's no way this disc deserves any more than two stars and I'm probably being generous in giving it that. This band is in desperate need of a lead guitar player. The rare attempts at playing anything that remotely resembles a decent lead guitar lick are laughable on this disk. At times they do sound like some of the groups others have mentioned, but never as good as any of them. If this band last for four albums or more I'd be very, very surprised. I just don't hear enough talent on this disc to make me think they can put out more than one or two more CD's before everybody looses interest in them."
1,One star is too high of a rating! Yee-GHADS this blows!,"Formulaic, re-hashed, ""you can't hurry love/Allman Brothers/riff and rhythm from corporate undead hell"", tired-ass crap on a stick.This is almost the worst dreck I've ever heard.But then there's Ryan Adams."
1,Ain't worth dingo poop,"This band's music is destined to be played on some WB show or future ""hip"" TV commercial selling metrosexual denim jeans.Save your money. This band and their contrived music should be banished to Pitcairn Island. If you're hankering for Australian bands try The Mark of Cain or good ole Birthday Party. Hell. Go buy some Kylie Minogue."
1,Iggy did it better,"Remember when bands wrote original music? Did Jet just watch that Mitsubishi Galant commercial and say, ""You know, guys, maybe if we copy this 'Lust for Life' song, we can be on a commercial too""? It's pretty nice for them that people who buy their records don't know and don't care which artists they've stolen music from. But hey, who needs 'originality' or 'talent' these days? We just wanna sell some records and iPods.To paraphrase ""Rollover DJ"": who cares what Jet plays, cause they've been playing OTHER PEOPLE'S SONGS all night."
4,"Crikey, they rock!","I must admit, I hadn't heard of this band before the Ipod commercials. Once I found out who they were and what they sounded like I ran as fast as i could to buy this album. These Aussies have brought back the true definition of Rock with their album ""Get Born""! Personally I think their best tracks are ""Lazy Gun"" and of course their two radio singles ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" and ""Cold Hard Bitch."" I enjoy their slower ballad-like songs as well, but there's nothing like the fast paced garage rhythm of the upbeat tunes! Obviously i encourage anyone to go out and by this cd and support a new undeniable talent!"
5,Jet ROCK,"Jet has got to be one of the Best new talents coming from the best country in the world, australia of course. they are wildly talented and have a great rock sound. all i can say is i own get born and i can't stop listening to it, JET ROKS!"
3,I'm Not Too Old,"I haven't heard the entire album yet, thus the mediocre rating, but does anyone else hear Aerosmith? Classic sound! If nothing else I'll play this for a heart attack work-out and dream again of being seventeen. I don't care if it's been done before, this kind of music is FUN and it never goes out of style."
2,Atrocious,"When I bought this CD, I thought I was going to be introduced to a band in the same vain as The Strokes, AC/DC, or Buck Cherry, what I got was a band that is overly produced and obviously commercial. Normally production is a good thing, but when it takes the raw emotion out of most of the tracks it is highly detrimental, Jet should have consulted a producer such as Raphael Gordon or Terry Date, even Rick Rubin or Mike Clink would have really brought this band out, unfortunately, we get a less than par album that sounds like a bunch of wannabes."
5,"In your face, old school rock and roll with attitude","This is rock and roll. If you are looking for a polished, packaged sound like Journey this is not a disc for you. If you are looking for the darkness and despair that came out of the grundge movement (not that it was all bad), this disc is not for you. Get Born is three cords and a lot of attitude. This disc rings of old Stones or Black Crows. Great guiters and a little sloppy sound that just calls you to jump off that couch and dance. Some reviewers knock this disc because it draws on a style of music that is located more in the past than in the present. However were the Stones knocked for drawing on Howling Wolf? Was Clapton knocked for drawing on Muddy Waters? If you want a fun disc to pop in the dash and cruise down the highway to, this is it!"
2,Heard it Before,"Wow, is this album derivative! The style is very similar to other groups (see the amazon review above). I actually find myself humming the originals as they sing. Even the cover is quite similar to one we've all seen before (Beatles - Revolver). The tunes are catchy, but I have a hard time listening to the album. I'm amazed these guys aren't in court. My advice is listen to the classic rock station, then buy the real thing."
3,Derivative and needless waste of plastic,"Jet is competent, but they are simply reprising the work of so many others before them. They would be a very good group to encounter at some remote roadside biker bar -- the unexpected quality in dire surroundings would be a welcome surprise and compensate for the inevitable brawls and tawdriness. But a disc on a major label?Jet's album is called ""Get Born"" and they should heed their own title and sing like boys who were born much later than their music suggests."
4,Who cares if it's been done before.,"Some good tunes. I'm not much of a Radio listener and I kind of live in a hole in the ground, so I only heard of these guys like 2 weeks ago, But I heard ""look what you've done"" and I had to buy the album. It's great."
3,"Pretty Good, But Not ""All That""","The influences on this CD are obvious--and they are good influences to have for a CD. The songs are, especially the single. But there is a tendency for the songs to turn right nstead of left, usually around chorus time. Most of the lyrics are not especially inspired. Buy it, but don't expect it to be a staple."
5,Rock and Roll is Back!,"Rock and Roll is back with this group! After hearing this CD and playing it multiple times all the way through (when was the last time you did that), I immediately drew comparisons to the Black Crowes, and The Cult. Further listening to the CD and I picked up on some Mersey Beat type rhythm's. You will not be disappointed by this group... yet. I anxiously await their second attempt. Hopefully they don't prove to be a flash in the pan."
5,Jet Get Born,Great Album...hard rockin' band that also knows how to play great softer songs. Amazing debut from Australian band.
1,"When I first heard ""Are you gonna be my girl""....","I thought to myself ""Hmmm maybe I could rewrite a George Thorogood song and make a quick buck too""Honestly, if you're a classic rock fan, as I am, why listen to a cheap imitation when you can listen to the real deal? Why take Sierra Mist over Sprite? Why watch the Psycho remake when you can see the original Alfred Hitchcock film? Why choose Webster over Arnold from Different Strokes?Don't support plagarism, go to your local store and buy albums by the bands that it made it possible for crap like Jet, the Darkness and Kings of Leon to exist in the first place. Don't let dumb retro nostalgia trends, brought about by the already crappy state of fake grunge and nu metal, dictate what's cool to listen to and what's not.Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I hear the Stooges' Fun House calling me from my stereo....."
2,You buy it for whats on the radio...and that's all you get!,"Ok, I'm not going to go on a long rant, but I would like to say I bought this CD based on its superb ratings on amazon and the three cool songs already released on the radio...what a mistake. Beyond ""Cold Hard B*tch"", ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"", and ""Rollover DJ"", there is nothing to this album. The lyrics are weak and the music uses the same three or four chords of every other crap rock band, not to mention that it all sound the same. Truly a waste of money and time. Download the three good ones and save your money."
2,I expected more,"OK, this will teach me to buy a CD based on the 2 or 3 songs I hear on the radio. After ""Are you gonna be my girl"" and ""cold hard b*tch"" and a few seconds of a couple of the other songs, I though, ""cool!"" After listening to the entire CD, however, I can tell you that the 2 above mentioned songs may be the high point of the CD, while the other tracks will likely get skipped over more often than not.If you are so inclined to buy this CD, catch it used and save yourself a few bucks. There is better music out there."
2,I don't like it,I don't like it because the songs they write are most of all copied and it's really a wast that they don't write an album on they're own.
1,"Boring, boring, boring!","When I've listened to this CD I wonder why I'm not listening to Oasis or ANY other band instead. There's nothing on it that isn't generic and predictable, like a cartoon of 50's rock. It has energy, yes, but so do many much better bands that also have depth and soul. Try Stellastarr* for instance, if you want music that not only gets you going, but has some staying power and EDGE. This is ridiculous. I just want to know who Jet's publicists are. Whoever they are, they are awesome."
2,"fun,indie,and catchy doesnt always mean good","ok ill admit it.""cold hard b****"" is a good song.i like it.not afraid to say so no matter how much beef i get from friends of mine.we all listen to bands like sevendust,shinedown,etc. but it doesnt bother me to branch out.the rest of the cd,other than ""CHB"" is just awful.i mean nothing was bearable for more than 5 seconds or so.i just couldnt swallow any of it.just not my style but ""CHB"" is a way cool tune.""are you gonna be my girl"" is just annoying and ""rollover dj"" sux mega.anyways,the point is,if you want a GOOD side of jet, get ""CHB"" on itunes or something and keep to the positive side of things."
1,Awful.,"These guys are such poseurs. Saying that they wear their influences on their sleeves is a massive understatement. Jet are essentially a cover band, and a crappy cover band at that.If you own this album, you really, really deserve to get punched in the face."
2,Lackluster,"Like the other reviewers said, there are some catchy songs here... But what else? These guys basically have stolen everything.. These are the guys that said Eddie Van Halen doesn't play with heart?Bullysht. But hey boys, regardless, heart and feeling isn't something you can steal. Sorry to be the one to break the news to you."
4,great throwback cd,"jet sounds like a finely tuned 70s band that has taken pieces from some of the greatest rock bands ever and put them together. AC/DC is one of the most kick-a$$ bands ever and people should love it if theres a new band that sounds like new AC/DC music. i dont understand how critics (otherwise known as idiots) can blast this album for being too much like these great bands. every band out there has done it, even the critics' darlings such as radiohead and the arcade fire. screw the critics, this is a very good cd and a definite buy."
5,Want Good Rock Music? You'll Find it Here.,"From the pure energy rockin' of ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" to the melodic ""Come Around Again"" and everywhere in between, these guys know how to write good rock songs. Jet's influences ring loud and true on this album, and they have the right ones: Rolling Stones, the Who, AC/DC, the Beatles, and more. The result? A rollicking, tuneful and harmonious guitar-driven masterpiece. This sums it all up: They wear their influences on their sleeves, yet maintain their originality. A note to the young crowd: This is good new rock; you'll appreciate this album, even if you consider the Rolling Stones, Who, etc ""dinosaur bands."" (By the way, I'm 24, and regret the days I dismissed the ""dinosaur bands"" as such) Jet allows you to enjoy good rock without having the mental picture of a bunch of middle aged men playing rock songs (see Rolling Stones last tour)"
5,"Change Nothing, The Futures In, Close the Door","JET is the greatest thing to come from down under, since Steve Irwin. When I first heard Are You Gonna Be My Girl in Madden 2004, I was confused, I thought this was a band from the 1st Woodstock era. Then I heard them and found out this is a new band, I had to here some of their other songs and was not dissapointed. There are alot of great tracks on this CD like my favorite song on the CD ""Cold Hard B****"" and ""Roll-over DJ""You can here the styles of classic rockers in almost every song, You can definently here the Floyd influence in ""Timothy"" and the Beatles style of ""Look What You've Done"".I can't wait for their next album to come out."
1,Ugh..,"This album makes me want to die. Seriously, I've never heard more ambiguously derivative music in my life. The lyrics sound like a random sampling of every rock cliche in the book. The music sounds like a Stooges cover band made up of 13 year olds who just learned how to play. Britney Spears may as well be singing these songs, because Jet is just as phony, trite, and ridiculous."
1,Hmmmm.........,"Sample lyric from Rollover DJ -""I wanna move but I don't feel rightCause you've been playing other peoples songs all night""Oh the irony."
3,Jet - Get Born,"I bought Get born because I knew that I liked the 4 singles that I had heard on the radio. It turns out, those were the only 4 songs I liked on the cd. It wasn't that the other songs were bad or boring, I just wasn't into them like I was the singles."
3,I like it but.....,"I really like this album. It's fun and hard edged. Yet it's kind of listening to the Rutles. They've totally nailed some of the sounds of the major bands of the 70s. The problem is that it's SO much like the original band it's scary. If you're familar with the original artists, you can hear some riffs and progressions that one still associates with the original song. As an example, ""Look What You've Done"" reminds me of ""Golden Slumbers"" by the Beatles, but there's a disconcerting extra piano phrase just before the vocals would have started. Later, the song sounds like it was influnced by tunes from ""Sgt. Peppers"". Very nice song, but it's so familar that it's unsettling.Like they say, ""It's like deja vu all over again"".Bottom line: I like the music, but until they can inject some originality, I doubt the next CD they release will be as well received by the public."
1,"man, these guys are so un-original it's sad","they would get two stars, but instead they get one for ripping off iggy pop - - - I don't understand how the musical public can give this band a hit song which is blatenlty stolen from Iggy's ""Lust for Life"" - they took the music from this classic song and put pussy lyrics over it - this group is shockingly unoriginal and uninteresting and the lead singer has a foolish looking mullet, so...peace out babybitches - don't buy this. If you want some seriously kick ass rock that is inspired by classic rock from the past, check out The Deadly Snakes, a great band which doesn't just rip off its influences, but makes original, good music instead."
2,It's a 3-song album,"These guys play with energy and excitement, and are very reminiscent of the early Who. But the song writing just isn't there. Besides the radio hits ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" (which is The Who's ""My Generation"" played sideways), and ""Look What You've Done"" (John Lennon's ""Imagine"" played sideways), there is really only 1 other decent song on the album.The rest are just rambling junk with no hook, no interesting solos, and forgettable lyrics."
5,"Finally, a basic album that just rocks.","It took an Aussie band to remind us Americans just how horrible our music scene is. Straight-ahead, in-yer-face, blues-based... it's refreshing, and very well done. A nice cross between the late 60's Beatles and AC/DC. Gobs of hooks, rudimentary chords, borderline-dumb lyrics but so profoundly cool. Definitely one of the top albums of the year, for, if nothing else, it shows us how pure and simple rock music can be."
4,w00t t3h j3tzorz,"i really liked this album. The first time I listened to it, I really liked the faster songs like ""Are you gonna be my girl,"" ""Last Chance,"" and ""Cold Hard B****."" After listening to the CD a few times through, however, I found that these songs all got really old, really fast. But I still love listening to the last two tracks, ""Lazy Gun,"" and ""Timothy."" ""Lazy Gun"" has parts that are fast and happy and fun, and then parts that are more sad and serious. It just always puts me in a good mood. And then ""Timothy"" is just a beautiful, sad, ballad. I've found that in a lot of other reviews, people aren't very fond of it, but I really like it. I just have a question - what exactly happened to timothy? I can't figure out if it's supposed to be about a kid who killed himself or a kid who was killed or a stillborn baby or WHATEVER. But overall, a very good album. They show their talent with a wide range of really different songs. Very nice."
2,"Sadly, I'm not impressed...","I was really hoping to like this album after hearing how it was supposedly a break from the mainstream alternative rock sound. And while I love the songs ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"", ""Cold Hard B****"", and ""Take It Or Leave It"", the rest doesn't really appeal to me. There's hardly anything original, if you ask me. The slow songs are just too...dull. The song ""Lazy Gun"" starts out great, but then turns into this slow dull song...much like the other slower tracks on this album. While I appreciate Jet's effort to take us back to classic rock, I think I'll just go back to the 70's and listen to the original instead."
3,I'm conflicted...,"The lyrics are simple and insipid and the band's ripping off of other artists (ACDC, the Kinks, Iggy Pop) is so blatant. However, these guys totally rock! I enjoy it as a guilty pleasure, I guess. I just hope they don't take themselves too seriously."
2,Half of the Album is Good,If they would just cut out the stupid ballads this album would be a lot better. There are 4 or 5 good songs on this entire album and that's about it.
4,"Solid, consistently pleasing set of tracks","I first got into this band after hearing their song ""Look What You've Done"", and after I put the CD in and listened to the whole thing, I was definitely quite pleased with the variations in tracks I heard. Some are great for driving to (""Gonna Get What You Need"" and ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl""), and others are great for simply listening to while doing work and singing along to (""Look What You've Done""). With the diverse track arrangement, you will be kept on your toes, regardless of what you are in the mood for. There is some slight resemblance to The Strokes, true, but Jet has their own sound and pace, enough to hold up on their own."
3,"Derivative, but at least its energetic",There's not much that's original on this one. There's just something vaguely familiar about most of the melodies and the slow numbers just seem to drag. They do seem to excel when they crank up the volume; at least the sheer energy will drag you along. I like it but it does not hold my interest after repeated plays.
4,"Nothing groundbreaking, but still fun","Yea, Jet sounds like a lot of past, great bands. Listen to the whole album, and you'll hear sounds from the Stones, Beatles, Pink Floyd, Iggy Pop, AC/DC, and a host of other bands. This album is not going to change the face or direction of Rock, and you're not going to hear much of anything new. However, this doesn't mean that the album is not enjoyable. It rocks, and it rocks well. Even the slower tunes are enjoyable, which is rare for a band without its own sound. The mix of songs plays well, seldom hitting a slow spot and causing you to skip to the next song. And when Jet speeds up the tempo, they rock very well. Three or four of the fast songs are automatic ""turn-up-the-volume-and-enjoy"" material, with great guitars, drums, and simple but effective lyrics.Overall, I rate this album at 4 stars - well done, fun to listen to, but not a classic."
3,Not bad at all,"I do like this CD for what it is..I too got suckered in by the iPod commerical and if the rest of the CD was closer to ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" I would like it a bit more. I love the whole sort of Stooges vibe you get with that track.The rest of the CD is a tad too psychedelic rock for me, sort of like ""The Coral"", only better, actually more like Zeppelin and Steppenwolf mixed in a blender, a much more expensive blender than in the 60's..but I digress. There are some fantastic tracks on this that are very old school formula rock, but the overwhelming swirling feeling I get from the rest of it make me feel like I took the pill that makes me smaller..and I will see you on the dark side of the moon...........know what I mean?"
3,Not quite there...yet.,"My brother, who keeps up with all the latest musical trends, developments, etc., highly recommended this album to me. He described it as a blend of AC/DC, Oasis, and retro-hard rock. An appealing possibility, yes? Well, Jet is on target half of the time. When the band kicks into gear with it's hard as nails guitar riffs, serpentine bass lines and walloping drums, you start allowing yourself the faint hope that their searing sound will cut through the sludge of Pearl Jam clones and Hip Hop trash peddlers masquerading as talented musicians. Jet, unfortunately, is not so sure handed with their ballads. Mundane, indistinguished, and a bit mewling in tone without a hook in sight. A lot of promise here, as evidenced by the rockers. A bit more work to do as indicated by the forgettable slow stuff. If they learn anything, their next release should be a scorcher."
5,Jet,This cd was incredible. All the songs sound different and it is completely original. I listen to it over and over again and never tire of it.
1,Rip-off,"Can I just say that ""Look what you've done"" rips off the lyrics of the Beatles' ""Sexy Sadie"" and the melody and style of Oasis' ""Don't Look Back in Anger"" and Fastball's ""Out Of My Head."" This band is fake."
1,So sad....,"My, my what an awful album! Sure they sound alright as far as sound is concerned- heck ""Are you gonna be my girl"" is catchy enough, but the complete lack of any originality on their part is horrible, without excuse. Even the band themselves have a lame excuse when asked why their hit single sounded so much like several other songs; they said ""you can't copyright a riff."" Pick this album apart and I dare anyone to find a scrap of something new. The band's name? From a Paul McCartney song. The album title? A lyric from Bob Dylan's 'Subterranian Homesick Blues.' The album art? The beatles' 'revolver.' Luckily I don't forsee anything coming from this band in the future; but I may be very wrong, if the populace still is able to consume this stuff. In conclusion; if you've been living under a musical rock since 1959 this album will sound new and fresh. If you haven't you might still like it to play at your school dance."
1,Get plunger,...Because this piece of crap doesn't flush very well. I agree with every other 1 star review. Jet rehashes every cliche known to mankind and then we are all in for a treat because the radio staions are all dying to make us listen to it 50 times an hour. I have one friend that likes Jet. That same friend likes Outkast. I don't think were friends anymore.
5,AMAZING,"JET ARE AMAZING, THE NEW ALBUM ROCKS. TRUST ME, OR IF U DONT JUST GO AND BUY IT ANYWAY, U WILL NOT REGRET IT!! from clare_m"
1,BORING!! Go listen to the real stuff,"This band wouldn't know origonality if it bit them in the arse. I'm sorry but it's not the 70's anymore! I'm not saying that bands like Linkin Park, and Limp Bizkit are good or anything but unfortuntly thats what this generation will be known for. This band is just recycling bands like AC/DC The Who, Iggy and The Stooges and The MC-5. And if you like that stuff stick with it because that IS good music!! and this is boring rehashed crap."
3,Great Album,"First of all the critic who works for amazon should find a new line of work because he obviously knows very little about music. First of all the track ""Look What You've Done"" is not Oasis-y. Oasis is a terrible band that completely ripps many chord progressions used by the Beatles as did Jet on this track. Look What You've Done is a complete rip of the Beatles' ""Sexy Sadie"", lyrically and musically. The piano riff is very lennonesque. Either way it is still a good album. Originality is hard to come by these days."
4,"Ignor my first review,my opinon has changed","Id just like to say after repeated listenings this album has grown on me.Dont dismiss these guys as another stupid retro, gradge rock talentless bunch of nobodies like I did.If you are a fan of alternitve rock,dont sleep on this one."
4,A great hard garage rock CD,"This band figures among the recent wave of heavy metal bands who make music like old metal. Although this is not exactly metal, it could be called hard rock. It is pretty much garage-rock with heavy AC/DC influences. It would be a 5-star album, but I think there are too many ballads. They should have just kept it with Look What Youv'e Done and Move On. However, the heavier songs whack you like a ten-pound wallop. You may have heard Are You Gonna Be My Girl on the radio, because it's a big hit. The best songs on the album are Are You Gonna Be My Girl, Lazy Gun, and Cold Hard [B****]."
4,Rock has returned!,"Highlights:Are You Gonna be my Girl? (sounds similar to Iggy Pop's Lust for Life)Rollover DJCold Hard BitchGet Me Out of HereGet What You Need (sound familar to any Rolling Stones' fans?)Jet, part of the old-school rock revival (along with the Vines, the Darkness and others), has crafted an excellent album in Get Born. It has good guitar riffs, an excellent mixing job, and a good balance between hard rocking songs and soft, gentle ballads. Get Born draws influences from many sources, including AC/DC, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Doors, and Iggy Pop. The end result is an album that is both a refreshing break from the nu-metal/pop-punk heavy rock scene of today and a tribute of sorts to the rock bands of the '60s and '70s. I would highly recommend, if you are a fan of old school rock or just rock music in general, that you should pick up a copy of Get Born."
1,Interesting reviews this band gets....,"The fact that they rip-off of other works shamelessly doesn't sink into many heads. It's not them being ""creative geniuses""; it's them being plain lazy. If a band's hits (all four of them) have to be ripped off in order to be made, I feel that there's no real talent there.Think about all the people who hate Quentin Tarantino. They say he rips off shamelessly, but he has all these people who hate him. Jet doesn't, and they are widely accepted for copying.Maybe our generation has sunk so low that it's alright to copy music endlessly. I don't get it.Now look at Interpol, The Darkness, Franz Ferdinand, and Modest Mouse. They copy the 70's or 80's STYLE, but what they don't do is copy. They make up their own riffs and drumbeats, and are a bit more original. I suggest you check them out."
2,They've Been Playing Other People's Songs All Night,"From the start, Jet look like a band with potential. Their lead singer has an outstanding voice and the band sounds tight together. They try too hard, but that's not what makes this album below average. The problem is they're ""influences"" are too pervasive in this album. The Bassline to ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" is a straight rip off of Iggy Pop, and ""Look What You Done"" has just about the same melody and lyrics as the Beatles' ""Sexy Sadie."" I didn't give the album one star because Jet have the tools to become a great rock and roll band. But the cliche's in this record are just too much. Next time, Jet, put substance over style."
5,Rock On!!!,"Well, this is one of the best rock albums right now. These Australian rockers are just awesome. There are many great song on this cd, but the ones that stuck the most in my mind are Look What You've Done, Are You Gonna Be My Girl and Timothy. Timothy is the slowest song on this one, it's quite cool, but if you like this slow ballads, Look What You've Done is even better and it's also my second favourite. And my no. 1 song on this album is definitely Are You Gonna Be My Girl. You may remember this song from the commercial for Vodafone. It's full of energy and it's simply a great song for a party.So if you're looking for some real rock, just get Jet."
2,If this is creative then the world is becoming a sad place-,"I will give the jets a compliment- There music is pretty catchy and the instrumentals are very decent, if not well put together. The vocals are not all that good, they can sing better than me- not that that is saying much. I would have rated the band 3 stars, if they had better lyrics that were more original, creative and deep. I mean- Are you gonna be my girl and Rollover D.J, come on guys don't you have anything better to sing about? Well the one thing that I despise of is that when you listen to The Jets for a long time it starts to disgust you how sexist they are! Some of the comments they make really makes me lose respect for them.""Well it's a 123 take my hand and come with me.Is it cause you look so fine that i really wanna make you mine?I said you look so fine that I really want to make you mine."" That just sounds really offensive, is he talking about a prostitute? Very disrespectful to women in my opinion."
2,Paint By Numbers Rock n Roll,"They have the look and the sound, but that's about it. The music just comes off as generic and so does the songwriting. There is none of the fire and inspiration that infects good rock n roll. I listen to this and it just feels forced to me, right down to the song titles. This has all been done before, and its been done alot better. The industry is becoming flooded with bands like this thanks to The Strokes. Buy their new album instead. Or dig back a little ways and discover some of the classics."
5,Very Good,"I was a little worried when I got this CD because I figured it would be like every other CD and band where you hear a song that you really like, but the rest of the CD was crap. When I listened to the entire CD I realized how wrong I was. I like a majority of all the songs on here. It is a CD that you can listen to at anytime and still love it. The more I listened to it, the more I noticed that I liked the CD even more. If you like just one song on the CD, you will love the rest. It has become my favorite CD and that has a song for any kind of mood you are in."
4,Great Stuff,"These guys are great. They and a number of other new bands like them are bringing back good solid rock. If you like these guys, you should check out Supagroup out of New Orleans. Like Jet, they a are no frills guitar driven rock band. Awesome!"
2,CahcahPooPoo,"This CD will get old real fast. I do not recommend buying it for the following five reasons: 1.It's unoriginal. 2.The songs are lame. 3.It sounds like AC/DC filler. 4.It's cheese 5.It's boring. I will say that the singer has a strong set of pipes and that the singles are pretty catchy. But the ballads are real cheese and the lyrics are good to poke fun at. If you're looking for a good ""classic"" rock sounding band, go back to the 70's and get the real thing. They might be entertaining to see live."
1,I Don't Get It,Sure it rocks but it's nothing more than average. This album is really boring. Once you've heard the first song expect nothing more.
1,are you gonna be my girl? = lust for life,"jet = trendy ""retro"" pseudoclassic crap. who seriously like this? you'd have to have amnesia or something to not know that this is a complete ripoff of important music from the '60s and '70s. somebody should push these guys, kings of leon, the vines, the white stripes and all the rest of them off a cliff. seriously."
2,This CD Sucks!,"I hate this cd. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the song ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" is pretty cool. This sounds so much like The White Stripes, but way crappier. This cd sucks!"
2,misplaced crap,"I thought this album would be a good rocker just like ""get born"", but the rest of the cd is just a re-hash of that song, or some really bad and stupid ballad that tries way too hard to emulate the beatles but falls short in a final desparate push every time."
3,"Good, but not terribly original","It's clear from listening to _Get Born_ that the members of Jet wear their influences on their sleeves, chests, legs, and pretty much any easily visible surface on their body. One can hear elements of T-Rex, Iggy Pop (I'm still convinced that ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl?"" is their take on Pop's ""Lust For Life""), The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and fellow Aussies AC/DC. But considering how many of their contemporaries share those influences and craft similar-sounding music, it's hard to call this a standout album. But at the heart of it, _Get Born_ is good, straightforward rock."
3,"Fast songs good, slow songs blow -- BEWARE the hype","A friend loaned me this CD and after the first couple of songs (one of which is the single, I believe) I was impressed. However, after a few fast songs Jet gets into some half-baked attempt at balladry--and they fail miserably. I am all for slow songs, but slow songs done right. These are some of the most trite songs I have heard in a while.Basically, if you long for the days when there were only two or threee decent songs on an album and you're happy to pay $10 for that, then by all means dig in. Otherwise, pass this up and go for something with a little more substance.I don't know, maybe some of the bands this album rips riffs from -- Rolling Stones, for instance. If The Verve was sued, then Jet should be in court any day now.One song is a total Oasis rip-off--they even sing like them. Who are they trying to please? Everyone, it seems.Make the music for yoruself guys, it'll play out better for you in the long run."
5,Real Rock,The only real rock out there.... simple as that. You like classic rock as opposed to todays yelling and screaming than these aussies are for you. Do yourself a favor and add these guys next to your ac/dc cd on your shelf.
2,Buy 3 songs on iTunes and save the money,"I am a rock fan, and especailly of the current array of bluesy bands, which Jet appears to draw much of its inspiration from. Listening to the band's recent crop of hits, it appeared the album will be a winner. Sadly, it is not.Instead of taking it further with songs like 'Rollover DJ' and 'Are you gonna be my girl', the band descends into a seemingly endless emotional string of songs that make you want to harm the CD player at worst, or just click the 'Next' button at best.This album is a great example of why people want to buy music on a song by song basis; why waste money on the 10 mediocre songs when only 3 are good. Save the money, forget about the CD..."
3,Easily reminds you of the past,"First off this cd rocks. I love their guitar beats and the drums are very fitting. Tracks like Are you gonna be my Girl?, Rollover DJ, and Cold Hard B*tch will stay in your head for days.My only real complaint about this cd is that it gets real old fast. Especially Are you Gonna be My Girl? which also sounds like they copied the song Lust for Life by Iggy Pop in the sevendies. Regardless of this, this is an awesome album with great tunes and is well worth your money."
3,"Not Very Impressed, But Still Pretty Good","I had higher expectations for this CD, but I tend to do that a lot. Half of the CD is pretty dang good, but the other half is just ehhhh. I'm not very impressed. The CD doesn't hold up to the expectation that ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" has set, but that doesn't mean that it is bad at all. You can find gold in this CD. Just listen to tracks like ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"", ""Rollover DJ"", ""Look What You've Done"", and ""Take It Or Leave It"". All and all, not very good, but not very bad."
2,Ugh...I had no idea....,"...That there was now such a generic, packaged formula for ""retro-rock"". First time I heard the cd my ears perked up ""wow, sounds good"" I thought. Second time I heard it, I was like...hmmm...what exactly is it about this music that sounds..empty...vacuous...cheesy...inane...insipid. By the third time I had heard it, it was clear that this band was a front, and that there was a corporate shadow in the background. Jet is contrived and prepackaged. Still has a few nice hooks, a couple nice lyrical phrase turns. It's better than a lot of the other schlock out there I guess, but if you want authenticity and soul, don't go with Jet. Try something, anything, by the Brian Jonestown Massacre, the best band in the world that nobody has ever heard of, or the Warlocks, or BRMC."
3,just for fun,"After unwrapping my new cd and listening to it all the way through for the first time, I was pretty happy with what I heard. I like Jet's two current singles and I have to say I wasn't really disappointed with the rest of their songs either. OK, so some songs may sound a bit repetative or blah, but basically, it's just a fun cd. I was surprised to find out that there are so many slow songs on this cd since they market themselves as a more up-beat band. However, the slower songs are good too. This album isn't exactly going to turn into a classic, but you have to give some credit to Jet for making a fairly decent cd. You should listen to Jet if you want to groove to something just for fun."
2,I really thought I'd like this one,"I heard ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"", and I love garage rock. So I picked this one up expecting more of the same. Unfortunately, that song was the high point. I listened to this album several times through going to and from work for a few days. Nothing else caught my ear. The rest of the album is a lot slower and duller. At this point I don't remember anything else about the album at all. One song, a great song, gives this 2 stars."
2,WHO'S THIS???,"Are these guys a cover band??? I like this brand of music, but come on, this is practically ripped off from everybody else you've enjoyed in this genre.If you really want to save money, avoid this album and download some music from AC/DC, Aerosmith or even Ratt.Don't get me wrong here people, the music isn't bad, it's just stuff you've heard about 10,000 times."
3,A catchy but unrewarding and disappointing album - you'll barely like it - 3.5 stars,"Jet's ""Get Born"" may have a bunch of catchy songs, but they're so MTV-oriented and dull that they just aren't worth your time. Cameron Muncey has a decent enough voice and the band has potential to be really good, but ""Get Born"" just doesn't deliver. The lyrics are pretty forgettable and uninteresting, so it's at least good that the musicianship is somewhat good. There are no ""bad"" tracks here, but they're all merely ""decent"". Their other saving grace is that it's not as much a guilty pleasure as, say, Idlewild or Nickelback is. You can tell that if they tried harder that they might actually be a pretty good band. Unfortunately, with ""Get Born"", all you get is standard MTV garage pop rock. There are MUCH better albums that you could get. Not really recommended.Highlights include:the entire album is just ""ok"""
1,Get lost!,"Man, this album is pedestrian, a copy from the copy from the copy, but this band is heavily marketed, so people fall for it. I was amazed to listen to this pile of junk, with nothing fresh, awuful lyrics, absolute no weight or energy. Incredible how this is selling!"
1,Poo!,"It's unfortunate that so many people would write decent reviews about this ablum. This piece will ruin your life if you listen to it, that's how bad it is. I bought this on a ""new music cd shopping spree."" Quick to jump on bandwagons, I bought this after hearing the song on the iPod commercial. After listening to the cd a few times, I almost lost my will to live. I'm forming a law suite against this band for almost stealing my soul. that's how much they suck."
1,average music and juvenile lyrics,"To me,music is a two part enigma;the music itself and then the lyrics. If the music is awesome it can overtake bad lyrics. However,in the case of Jet,the average music of this band cannot make me overlook the childish,lame,unimaginative lyrics to all of their songs. I know grade school kids that can write better words.Example:""4,5,6,come on and get your kicks"". Seriously? Go to any lyrics based web site and look at their lyrics. Truly pathetic. This band is in serious need of a lyricist. They would be better off in a singer who screams loud so you couldn't understand what he's saying but he sings loud and clear and the words are so bad I'm embarrassed to sing them out loud. So-so music and lame-ass lyrics give this band a one star rating. Hey Jet, here's some lyrics you could use:""4,5,6 your band has awful lyrics"" Or,'Not a 5 but a 1 star 'cause your lyrics are below sub-par"""
1,Corporate Rock,"This sounds like something written by/for a fake band in a movie or a TV show. It doesn't rock -- it pretends to rock. Iggy Pop wannabes striving to create a commercial sound. I hear that starting a business in hopes of getting bought by Microsoft is now an accepted business practice. I liken music like this to the same mentality: ""Let's write cheesy corporate rock and maybe we'll get placed in an iTunes commercial."""
3,"Decent, but Not Great","Nothing too inventive here, but Jet revisit some earlier and much missed rock n' roll styles. Some say they're an AC/DC clone, but as a big Acca Dacca fan, I just don't see it. Just because they play some rock n' roll, doesn't make them an AC/DC clone.There's some good stuff here, and some mediocre stuff as well. I like the harder rock material (""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" & ""Cold Hard Bitch"" for example), but it's a bit too soft, overall, for my palate.There seems to be a bit of a rock revival with bands like Jet and Wolfmother (seriously, what's in the Aussie water?), but they don't quite live up to the standards set by the classics of the genre.Fairly enjoyable, nevertheless."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"Yes, these guys steal from every power chord rock band known. No, this stuff won't change your life. No, it's not genius. But yes, it's one heck of a good time.Basically, it's AC/DC, Rolling Stones, Black Crowes, Kiss, and some BTO for fun. No apologies, just good time rock and roll."
5,Jet is Taking Over!,What we really need in this music industry is a band who can make you wanna get up and rock out. Not a lot of bands these days do that. Their all about looking hot and cool. Not Jet. They have awesome music and aren't concerned with appearences. They are more focused on their music. I think Jet is an awesome band!!! Go Jet!!! Ally06
1,Horrible CD,"The only good song on this album is ""Cold hard bitch"". The rest of it totally sucks. The lyrics in the other songs are as terrible as the gay music. I mean come on...they put out a kick ass song like cold hard bitch and then pussified the rest of the album...then this guy has a hard on for ranting about DJ's cuz they ""spin other peoples songs""...give me a break and save your pussification of an album for nickelback or creed. Then the song ""Timothy"" starts out with him again trying to sing a slow ballad which his voice is NOT made to do, and as it cracks while he moans Timothy like a depressed gay lover I almost puked up my lunch. Thank god I was close to the ""next track"" button or I probably would have commenced the up-chucking. This album is an example of why I do not buy CD's anymore and just burn them from others or download free music. If I could give this disc less than 1-star I would. Sucks ass. Don't buy this album."
1,urrg!!,"Like the darkness, these guys are just a big joke. This style of music has already been done(and done much better) and music has evolved since the 70s and 80s. Do not support this retro, gradge rock crap."
5,Understandin electric utilities in 2010 and beyond,"This short 127 page book (including many pages of footnotes and charts), published in 1986, is an incredibly important and valuable book to understand the dynamics of the electric utility industry. Its observations are completely applicable towards an improved understanding of the electric utility industry of 2010. Its observations help explain the industry's lack of incentive to adopt new technology and broadly identifies the themes driving and underlying the industry's monopoly behavior. The author, a College of the Holy Cross scholar, identifies conflicts and past solutions and provides statistics to back up his observations."
3,pro quality 1/2 inch 20-250 torque wrench,Works fine.Good bargain for the price. Only complaint is the micrometer torque setting.The lock does not work so well so you have to be careful so as not to over or under torque
4,A great anime series!,"I got this based on the reviews and this is my first experience with Samurai 7 and I can say that I am very impressed by it. The picture quality is pretty decent, though not the best that I've seen for animes, partially due to the style of the series. The only negative I can say in this review is about the condition of the product when I received it. When I opened the package, the spine of the cardboard was sort of ripped and when I took one of the cases out a whole entire corner was broken off of the case. Not really a big deal, but just as a note, Amazon (and affiliates) need to ensure the packing is done better to insure that these things don't happen."
1,Only for non-Americans: This bluray is not code-free,"Living in europe, I have the wrong country code. For many blurays this is no issue. But Samurai 7 does not play on a european playstation :-(Otherwise, I'm sure it's a great disc."
5,Europa Europa,"Be prepared emotionally for dramatic intrusion into your life, as watching this is very real.It is a true account of what events occurred. My father was there, and at that time. There is overwhelming evidenceas to what happened in real life, portrayed in this video. Safety on all who watch this film."
4,"opinion on ""europa europa""","I felt that the movie was good because it was a good story and it portrayed what was happening in the third reich well. By watching the movie, the audience is able to understand what life was like for a Jew trying to escape from presecution, what being in a Russian and German school during world war 2 was like, and what it felt like to be fighting for Nazi Germany. It showed how the war was not really against Russia or the Allies but against the Jews which they felt were an inferior race. The movie shows how a Jewish boy, whom according to Nazi ideology is inferior, survives and becaome German hero. The message behind the movie is that there is nothing to back up Nazi ideology and that there is no such thing as an inferior race because the Jews whom they thought of as inferior was successful in a German school."
5,A Nazi Jew? It's True!,"One of the best movies I ever saw and have practically learnt by heart, Russian, German et al! The movie tells of the incredible yet TRUE story of a Jewish boy during WW2 who saves himself by fitting in with the Communists by speaking Russian and with the Nazis by speaking German. But its not only knowing how to speak the language - its knowing how to adapt to their way of seeing the world. The movie is so credible because we can understand through his eyes how easy it is to be swept away by peer pressure and by group thought- even if the ideals are evil. We also get a fascinating glimpse into what the Nazi schools were like teaching their ""genetics"" classes, as well as falling in love with a young beautiful Nazi girl which of course can never be consummated for a few reasons- but I don't want to give too much away. I had to remind myself while watching this that it is TRUE! A must see! I can watch it another hundred times."
1,Region 2,The Amazon.com listing fails to mention that this copy is for Region 2 and will not play on many units in the United States. This would appear to be an important point to include in the Amazon.com listing.
2,eeew,"The movie Europa, Europa was definatly not the best ""based on a true story"" that I have seen. actually, the documentaries that we watched in history were probably better. If they wanted to make this movie better, the directors would cut out the inappropriate parts (on the train, in the barn, in the bathtub) because they didnt add anything of value and they were kind of disgusting. And if it was a true story, i really dont see how soloman could still be alive after everything that happened to him. I just dont think its possible for one teenager to betray so many people and get away with it. There is a line that he crossed, he should of remembered his religion and his family and stopped being so selfish. So overall, this movie kind of sucked.he totally should have followed our motto- death B4 disloyalty."
1,no!,"Seriously, you cannot watch this movie. Yes, the message of courage is great and the idea behind the story is good but it's not realistic and there are many unnecessary parts in it. The nude parts had nothing to do with the movie's plot. It just looked as if he was saying ""hey look at my body isn't it great?"" Yes, the story's important but it just seemed as if this kid lived his life completely off of luck, and that's not realistic. I watched this movie in history class and I hope to never see it again. The movie would have been good if some of those parts were excluded. Instead of enjoying the movie, I would turn my head everytime a bath would come up (and there were plenty of those). Don't get me wrong, the story was good but some things were definately dramatized and made up. My class just kept saying ""wow he's lucky,"" ""that was lucky,"" ""woah, how did he get through that?"" It was not a good movie. I do not recommend it for anyone. Horrible."
3,Lacks moments of reflection,"The other reviews have much worthwhile to say, so I'll focus on what I find missing in the film. With all the action, where are the moments of reflection by the Solomon character or others who might have clarified his situation for him? Above all, he was an individual who responded to his circumstances in a unique way. Although he miraculously survived, his sense of himself and what is true must have been severely damaged. He was abused. I wonder how he lived the rest of his life and did he heal from his traumas?"
3,INTERESTING--GN,"This movie seemed very interesting. Solomans lucky charm seemed to work on everyone, the Germans, and the Russians but it seemed weird that all the Jews were killed except for him. The movie was good, showing all teh different parts and aspects to war, but there were some parts that could have been omitted, especially the train scene. Also, the movie showed the hatred and strange aspects to war that people like us would never expect. THe actors did a nice job portraying the different war heros during the war and they showed passion and fear as tehy were acting. The movie seemed very realistiv but not. Overall I enjoyed the movie but thought a few parts could have been omitted."

3,"Yes, it's a terrific movie ... But it's a horrible DVD","When will the studios get a clue??? This NONanamorphic DVD looks terrible on my widescreen television. I was hoping that the wait would have been worth it. It was not. When I zoom the image to fill my screen the subtitles drop off the bottom (out of view), and I can't read a thing! My German is good enough to follow most of the movie, but my Russian is still spotty, and my Polish is absolutely nonexistent. How are you supposed to watch a tri-lingual movie if you can't read the subtitles????I have loved this movie since its original release, and was eagerly anticipating its arrival on DVD. But this kind of half-hearted effort should not have been issued. DO NOT BUY THE CURRENT DVD. (Rent it? Absolutely! The story is a rare example of truth being stranger than fiction, and the movie is beautifully executed.)"
4,Next Holocaust Tragic Comedy,"As it is customised recently, War II and Holocaust are being depicted in tragic comedies to modern viewers much easy to swallow, perhaps (see The Tin Drum ~ Original Theatrical Release [Import, All-region] (Dvd),Life Is Beautiful,Saving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)).Camera follows a thirteen old around war-turned European countries, and his fantastic encounters with different people-friends, enemies, paedophiles, sexy females, soldiers of any walks and relatives at the end young man shown up.Entertaining MANSES (stories) of the drama and history of the Europe and folks of the World War Two."
5,Europa Europa,"I thought that the movie was depicted well. Although, there were some truths that were stretched and some imagination was used. The story of Solomon is a story of great luck, and a boy's struggles trying to survive during the Third Reich. Solomon is greeted by many people with different beliefs than him and he is very open to them. There were some unnecessary parts, such as some of the train seen, and the extended barn scene. Our history teacher wanted us to see what life was like for a teenage jew living in Germany, and I believe that this was illustrated tremendously in the movie."
3,A Good Story,"I liked the story in the movie. Though it is a remarkable story some things seemed too unrealistic to be based on a true story. He must have been an extremely lucky guy to escape all of that. It's sort of hard to believe that all that could have happened to him. I thought it did a good job of portraying the mass slaughter of the jews. Also it showed that not all Germans were murders, and some actually helped the jews. Overall, the movie was pretty good."
3,review,"This rated R moview is historically accurate. The setting of his movie was aroud WWII. This movie is about a jewish boy who disguises himself an aryan and livea among the aryans in germany. Throgh out the movie he was very lucky, he never got caught. Although this movie sounds to be to good to be true its bases on a true story. The most iteresting this about this movie is that the jewish boy always got away with everything, even in the end when he was about to get shot by the russian soldiers his brother saved his life. They both set out on a journey to america to save their lives."
5,Fabulous New Author on the road to stardom,"An excellent and exciting novel. The suspense filled beginning kept me hooked from the start and I could not put this one down. If you like Dan Brown and Jonathan Kellerman, you will absolutley love this first novel of up and coming star Daniel Sheehan!"
1,Does not fit stock 98 Nissan Sentra GXE exhaust,"The flange that connects to the down pipe was off by about 15 degrees. As a result it will not connect to the hangers and the catalytic converter. I had to undo the weld at the flange, rotate it in place, mark it and reweld it. Turned a very simple task (I already had the exhaust disassembled) into a long and frustrating process."
4,I like how it went on very smoothly ...,I like how it went on very smoothly and didn't clump. The brush was great for curling purposes. The mascara was also easy to remove at the end of the day! I'd recommend it to all my friends.
1,Mascara,did nothing for me.Would not recommend. Not even a good mascara. I found Maybeline's the Falsies Volum Express Mascara did thicken and made my lashes look longer. Lasts all day. I have not found anything to Actually permently thicken and lengthen lashes.

4,Just Prior To My Entry Into The Service,"I purchased and read this book way back in 1972. I served not in the Marine Corps, but rather the Army and it was just prior to my basic training that I read this book. I think it was in part to the book that I had this expectation of what was going to happen once I arrived at Ft. Ord, California for basic - being yelled at to get the hell off the bus, being yelled at once off the bus; didn't happen, didn't even see a drill sargent for quite awhile and once we did it wasn't as intense as that. Well, this was the Army and not the Marines."
1,"Apple Monster, not Master","This tool peeled, sliced and cored twenty apples in no time and then began tearing up the next batch, hacking out big chunks of apple with the peel. I kept adjusting and readjusting the blade arm and then it popped off. I'm returning it to the manufacturer. It's a beautiful idea but so inconsistent in performance. If you get this, keep an old fashioned corer handy. You may need it."
5,300 pounds of apples processed so far!!,Love this product! A must have for any canner or baker. The suction cup does need a SMOOTH surface to stick down on. My tile counter has too much texture. I stick it on a heavy plastic cutting board and that actually works better for me. After the first hundred pounds or so you need to turn the board a bit to keep from getting too sore! :)
3,love the old school,ahhh the 80s i had to get another copy of this book as i STILL HAVE HIS KNIFE BOOK !!so i got the the shuriken book as well when i finally found a cheap copy great stuff....be suprised when ya find out some of the stuff works...good buy if you can get it cheap!!!3 stars just for the title!!!
3,RETURN TO FORM,"This is their best since so much for the afterglow. There are some weak tracks especially the single Hater. I really hate that song. Overall it's really good album. I reccomend it. I think Drama king is my favorite track. Glorious, Clean, Broken, Portland Rain are great songs too."
2,This is not Everclear,"You could tell with the last release with the original members that Everclears creativity was being replaced with a commercial bridge and everything else as well. I have been listening to music and an amateur guitarist for years and I think Everclear with it's original members is one of the top Ten bands of all time but Welcome to the Drama Club is horrible. It' like it came from a machine. Alexakis is a awesome artist, phenomenal lyricist and a great punk style player but this release is one for the contract obligations. I hope Alexakis has some more left but the chemistry of the past needs to be addressed. I wish the original members the best of luck because they were truly a one in a lifetime occurrence. Buy everyone of their CDs that are before 2003.They are well worth it."
1,Not The Band They Used To Be,"I've been a diehard Everclear fan since the early 90s. Ever since Craig Montoya and Greg Eukland left the band, however, Everclear has just not been the same. A once hard rocking alternative band, Everclear has gradually shifted to mainstream pop music with each new album released. That said, I was really rooting for ""Welcome to the Drama Club."" I really want to love every Everclear album and I can't help but feel compelled to purchase them with the hopes that Art and the ""band"" won't let me down. As I listened to this latest album, I felt instant dejavu. Long time fans will quickly recognize that most of the songs contain recycled lyrics and chords from earlier, more successful albums. ""Glorious"" is the only song on the album I can stand to listen to. Go to itunes and download it for 99 cents. Don't waste your money on this album. If you want a real rockin' Everclear album, I strongly suggest ""World of Noise"", ""Sparkle and Fade"", or ""So Much for the Afterglow""."
2,Lackluster Effort,"Following the renewed and applaudable effort of Slow Motion Daydream, Welcome to the Drama Club leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The song writing is weak, though the music is fairly good. It seems that Alexakis is trying to hard to recapture the hard edged feel of early albums, but without the emotion to back it up.Many of the songs will remind you of So Much for the Afterglow and the first volume of Songs from an American Movie, but empty shells of those efforts.However, there are some gems on this album, such as Portland Rain, Under the Western Stars, Your Arizona Room, and the amazing song Glorious.You're better downloading the mp3's of the highlights rather than purchasing the whole album.Ranking this, it would be behind Slow Motion Daydream but light years ahead of the Everclear's weakest and most lyrically disappointing album, Songs from an American Movie Volume Two."
4,Everclear is back!,"I wasn't too happy with Everyclear's last two CDs...only played them a few times. But Welcome to the Drama Club grows on you right away. I have played it 8 times since I purchased it and it gets better with each playing. Shine and Hater are fun songs and might be hits. My personal favories are Glorious and Your Arizona Room. I agree that some of the songs seem like re-workings of past songs (I could swear I heard some of the same lines in other Everclear songs (skinney legs, taco bar, etc.))...but is that a bad thing? This is one of the few CDs I can play from start to finish and not have to skip a song."
5,An interesting and compelling police story.,"This book is an interesting novel about the lives of Police Officers with graphic detail and enough romance to keep the story interesting The author has captured a rare glimpse of the day to day encounters of veteran and rookie police officers, by describing in detail unusual but realistic events. A rare twist of humanity; just when you think you have seen everything, something else happens. A book written with graphic detail, but is still reasonable and in good taste. I would recommend this book to those thinking about a career in law enforcement, someone who would like to learn what it's like to be a law enforcement officer, or someone who would like to be entertained. Well done!"
4,Article 32,"What a compelling story! Article 32 reflects the inherent contrast and internal conflicts that our soldiers face almost every day in wartime situations, and the choices and actions they take in the name of 'following orders'. Wow."
1,About Bruce Tenger's Books,"About the only good thing that can be said about the books of Bruce Tenger is that they state that a particular style exists. I have read a number of his text and find their information regarding style an inaccurate and romantisised version of how people would like martial arts to work. His examples are based on some bizarre 70's mentality that still wants Chuck Norris movies to be reality. Good Martial Arts books exist, however nothing written by Bruce Tenger qualifies"
3,Probably the best Bruce Tegner book,"Yeah, yeah... I know. It's sort of like claiming to be the best winemaker in Idaho. Still, just about everyone who reads martial arts books has read Tegner, and this is one of his best. It's probably significant that he doesn't appear in the book. The book is, however, rather inexpensive, and does show jujutsu techniques which will work okay (if you can manage to apply them). Tegner was making a fair case for the utility of jujutsu way back when it wasn't fashionable. After all, back then, jujutsu was ""old hat"" and was often thought of as just another name for judo. So all in all, this book is alright for beginners who want to decide which martial art to pursue. It will give them a slight taste of what stand-up jujutsu looks like. If they wish to delve any deeper, they must look elsewhere."
3,Recommended for experienced Judoka/Ju-Jitsuka only...,"This book features many, many techniques, but it is not intended for the beginner. You won't find much instruction, mostly composed of one series of photo's depicting one technique after another. For the experienced Judoka/Ju-Jitsuka, this book deserves a 4-star rating; for beginners, or those interested in learning more about the art of Ju-Jitsu, this book ranks a 1-star rating. This is NOT a how-to book, nor does it contain discussions of ethics, legal consequences of your actions, nor does it discuss the history of the art much. If you have a few years of Judo/Ju-Jitsu training behind you, this book will be VERY useful in expanding your repertoire. With 10 years experience in Judo and Ju-Jitsu, I find Tegner's books helpful, but sometimes difficult because of his editorial comments. Most of his books are better suited to experienced martial artists, so choose carefully."
3,lots of information,"this is a good book, i don't know much about jujitsu but i bought this book because i wanted to learn more. Tegner has presented a lot of techniques in this book, but that is all they are, there is no order or structure presented in the book and at times it seems more detail and better pictures are needed to get the point across. i would recommend this book if you are a martial artist and want to expand your technique repretoire or if you just want to know more about jujitsu than this is a good book, full of techniques and a very reasonable price."
4,Excellent for beginners.,"I just bought this book and have had an opportunity to put it through its paces. I've found the text to be very readable and instructive. Unlike many martial arts ""Manuals"" this one doesn't try to shroud the techniques in mystery, or pretend that you can become a black belt just by reading the book. Instead, it presents the material in an easy to read format that accurately describes the action in the photographs. A word of caution though, it reads a bit like a text book and the smallish black and white photos sometimes make it hard to see exactly what's going on. Overall, it is an excellent introduction to the art of ju jitsu for those who would like to either explore the martial arts, or experienced stylists who wish to expand their knowledge."
3,Professor L. Hilton would be proud!,I am a martial artist of over 23 years and I would like to say that this book is ok for beginners. I would also like to say that it has some of the same techniques I found in Professor Larry Hilton's book of Nippon Ketsugo Ryu.
3,Cam works but streaming software needs to be removed,Clarity is great. Connection is quick and easy. Works in XP like a charm. All the software with exception of the video streaming software seems to function. Teveo is packaged with this unit and it doesn't seem to be functioning - the company Teveo doesn't host their site anymore for live video streaming so don't count on using this software. Not many USB 2.0 cams on the market to pick from and the couple I looked into both had Teveo packaged with it. Downloaded some free webcam streaming software and camera operates great. Noticeable difference from old Logitech USB cam. You can easily purchase streaming software online- but that was sorta the point - to have a fully functional package. Orange Micro didn't take ownership of the issue when I asked for a replacement streaming software or recommendation.
2,Pee Yellow,This camera appears to NOT have a real manufacturer and is only a branded item from Orange Micro - whoever that is. When you try to find a driver for this item you can't find it. Instead you get directed to endless ads and sites that want you to buy something. In addition the resolution is not that great and the camera puts a nice yellow band right in the middle of the screen from top to bottom for those trying to see you such as in a video call. I would not buy this again.
4,Good enough that I purchased books 1-4,"Good enjoyable read, would gladly recommend. I would consider this light science ficton/fantasy, strong characters and a wonderful heroine, who you can actually relate too. So very tired of wimpy females and this was a strong believable character."
4,the god decrees,"The story was enthralling,the battle scenes being some of the best i have read giving a vivid picture in your mind of what was happening.I very much look forward to the next installment."
3,Inadequate description,"The description of this product is inadequate. I made sure I didn't order a product that said ""x-small"" in the description and I ended up receiving an extra small collar anyway. There is no description of size for this product."
3,Ehh Shout Out About Movies is better...,"My family and I play ""Shout Out About Movies"" every Christmas, but we've played all 4 DVD's already. I heard this game was similar, but it was just ok. The product itself was great though and I received it on time and in great condition."
2,DVD Trivia Game,"We are huge ""Shout about Movies"" fans and traditionally have 20-30 friends and family who play ""SAM"" on Christmas evening. I was soooo dissapoined this year to see that they did not come out with a new one. So, I purchased DVD Trivia games. While the questions are good and a bit tougher than ""SAM and Scene It"", the technology was greatly inferior and not near as diverse and fun. I'd recommend it if you really like tougher movie triva (particularly horror movies and other B movies...not your traditional higher quality better rated movies), but otherwise, it's worth repeat play of Shout About Movies."
5,Why is this titled the Centenial Edition?,"It's in NO WAY the centennial of ""The Odd Couple"", nor is it even close to it's golden anniversary. March 10th was the 44 anniversary of it's Broadway opening with Art Carney in the role of Felix Unger and Walter Matthau as Oscar Madison, but that's about it.Grumpy Old MenGrumpy Old Men [Blu-ray][[ASIN:B000FOPPC4Grumpy Old Men/Grumpier Old Men]]"
4,The Odd Couple,"Neil Simon's ""The Odd Couple"" is an appealing comedy about two divorced men, who decided to move in with each other. After divorcing his wife, the neat, clean, neurotic nut Felix, is taken in by Oscar, the broke, disorganized slob in his New York apartment. At first, things go well for the interesting duo. Oscar is saving money, and, for the first time eating real food. But then, things take a toll for the worse. They create such an awkward living situation, that Oscar is forced to throw Felix out. They were best friends prior to the moving in, playing poker every night. Yet after living together, they notice that the little things that they do to each other drive them insane."
5,Excellent!,"I saw this movie about two weeks ago on AMC. It was funny and made me really laugh. I'm a 16 year old who likes classic and ORIGINAL films, not today's CGI filled/no talent actors/rap star cameo-esque films. Anyway, I really liked Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau after seeing this movie. Of course, I always liked Matthau, because I've seen him in a couple of movies with Gregory Peck (also on AMC). It was a great movie!"
2,Did not like it. Remembered it being much better in its time.,"I bought this more from nastalgia reasons. The acting was good and you will get some enjoyment from this if you are a Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau fan. However, the pace is really quite slow and there are just a couple of memorable scenes. I would not recommend this one if you are looking for an exciting movie. If you like both actors, I would strongly recommend Grumpy Old Men and Grupier Old Men. Both are classics."
5,BETTER THAN IT'S SEQUEL BUT NOT AS GOOD A PLOT,"I VIEWED THIS MOVIE FOR THE SECOND TIME YESTERDAY ON ""SHOWTIME"" FOLLOWED BY ""THE ODD COUPLE 2."" THOUGH I LIKE THIS BETTER THAN PART 2,I HAVE TO SAY THAT PART 2 HAS A BETTER PLOT,IS FUNNER TO WATCH,AND IS (PERHAPS) FUNNIER (THOUGH THIS FILM IS PRETTY FUNNY TOO)."
1,"Not funny, not believable","This adaptation of the play hasn't worn at all well over the years. The movie was directed and filmed much as if it were still on stage, using the peculiar and somewhat stilted projection-style of acting that is deemed necessary in most stage productions. Neither Matthau nor Lemmon or any of the supporting cast are especially believable. The scenes are overdone and not funny. The characters all come across as actors playing a part and never cross the line into people we care about. Lemon's character is so overdone that he is the least believable of the group. It's difficult to understand why this film gets such praise in 2010."
2,not all that funny,"Basically contrived and a waste of time. Although am a huge fan of both Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau...this poorly written flick doesn't cut it. Not the actors' fault, either. Blame it on Neil Simon--who was never very good to begin with.To all the aspiring writers out there: if you want to know HOW NOT TO write a comedy all you have to do is watch anything written by Neil Simon. Why? Why does every third line have to be a ""punch line?"" Not only that, you can sense this guy (Simon) straining to be funny and clever...and he rarely is.Most films written by this guy are really hard to take. Just my opinion."
2,Ok if you like Neil Simon,"The Odd Couple is much like most Neil Simon""comedies"" - 1st act of humorous setups, 2nd act of conflict(and in TOC the conflict is pretty mean-spirited), 3rd act everyone kisses & makes up. I guess this paved the way for 80's & 90's TV sitcoms where all the humor is ""dissing"" the nerd or geek (actually unlike the TOC series). Matthau's Oscar comes off as a scummy, loud drunk with repugnance for all, most of all Felix - if you see the humor in that go ahead & buy this."
4,Grumpy Young Men,"Matthau and Lemmon are an indelible comic duo in this great story that is genius in its simplicity. Based on Neil Simon's hit play, the film is a bit stagy, from which many stage-to-screen adaptations suffer. But the rapport between the two leads is remarkable, resulting in a hilarious movie. Some people criticize Lemmon's performance as being too melancholy, which I can understand. However, the fact that Lemmon's Felix takes himself as seriously as he does makes his tragic moments that much funnier. In my opinion, ""The Odd Couple"" remains today the ultimate ""buddy"" picture. A final note, I would have liked to see more features on the DVD, like interviews with Lemmon and Matthau, writer (Simon) and director (Gene Saks) commentary, and perhaps some deleted scenes, if any."
4,The Odd Couple,It was a very funny comedy. At times hilarious! I love something that makes me laugh and have a good time. It was so entertaining and I am so glad that I bought the product.
3,NOT ONE OF THE BETTER AEROSMITH SONGS,"THIS WAS AN OK SONG. BUT I LIKED THE VIDEO BETTER, WHICH IS A RARITY FOR ANY SINGLE! THIS IS REALLY JUST ANOTHER ONE OF AEROSMITH'S POWER BALLADS. BUT, IT'S AN OK SONG TO LISTEN TO SOMETIMES. I'M ABOUT TO BUY ''O YEAH! ULTIMATE AEROSMITH HITS'' REAL SOON. AEROSMITH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK BANDS OF ALL TIME. AND BEING ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COME BACK FROM THE BIG SLUMP THEY HAD TO ENDURE IN THE EARLY 80S IS AMAZING."
5,Emblemz Decal,"The decal was exactly as advertised. It was shipped on schedule, it arrives on schedule. was in time for Christmas."
5,Super back support via Amazon purchase,"Excellent product at a great price. I have a big problem in my lower back (disc herniation, disc misaligned, etc.) and I use this pillow on my golf cart. Works great and makes it easy to play 3 times a week without pain."
4,Transfer Quality is Bad,"The content is brilliant and entertaining. Other reviews go into detail, and you probably already know of this movie anyway.I'd like to describe the DVD media itself (produced in 2001).First, it is ""wide screen"" but letterboxed, NOT anamorphic format! This means that it loses 25% of the available resolution when watched on a wide-screen TV.Worse, the film is grainy and blurry in places. It even has some jerks and missing frames.Finally, there is no commentary or interesting bonus material.In short, they did a dis-service to a great film. It belongs in the bargain basement with the ""B"" movie mega collections, in terms of quality and value."
1,wont play,DVD wont play in Australia. Selling a product that dosnt work is not good buisness. Sending it back is more work than it is worth
5,Thank you Peter Sellers,"Not only watching the Return of Pink Panther to me means burst into tears because of laughing till I faint, but also even when we remember the scenes of the movie while chatting with friends gives enough hype to go in a laughter crisis again as well. I am addicted to this movie and am never sick and tired (but my stomach is) of watching it more than a hundred times ! I have collected almost all Peter Sellers movies from Amazon. And whether some might not like him, he is still a Legend for me."
5,Return Pink Panther DVD,"One of the funniest movies in the Pink Panther series. The inspector is up to his normal hijinks in this movie. If you want a lot of laughs, recommended."
3,Not my taste,But I bought this for my brother who loves it. If he were to rate this movie it would be a 5 star not just 3.
3,"A fun comedy, but a mediocre DVD","I've always liked this movie, ever since I first saw it on cable TV back around 1976. I was looking forward to seeing it again, but this DVD is not a very good edition. Rather than a proper widescreen (anamorphic) image, they've simply shrunken the image to fit into a standard 4:3 image, leaving lots of wasted scan lines at the top and bottom. This was the only way to do widescreen in VHS, but DVDs can do much better. On a 16:9 TV, an anamorphic image will take up the full width of the screen, while this sort of lame transfer will appear as a little box in the middle. Meanwhile, on a good modern 4:3 TV such as a Sony WEGA XBR, the TV will handle an anamorphic image by squeezing all of its scan lines into a 16:9 rectangle, thus achiving near-HDTV resolution. This sort of careless DVD transfer prevents either a 16:9 set or a good 4:3 set from doing their jobs properly, resulting in an inferior image. I'm very disappointed."
4,Panther Redeux,"Peter Sellers brought (as Inspector Closeau) brought the Panther to the screen. It is the only character that Seller ever reprise . This film is one of those films missing from the six disk Pink Panther Collection...and Its is a welcome treat.Christopher Plummer taking over for David Niven in this Panther sequal is weaker than Niven in comparing. However, it is still fun having him around as a character of Lord Litton.With Sellers more bumbling and slapstick than he was in his first two outting (The original Panther and a Shot in the Dark), He set the tome of future Panther films which made. Burt Kwouk and Herbert Lom are welcome as foils to Sellers's humor...as well as the animated openning creditsThis Pink piece is a welcome piece for the Panther puzzle.Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
4,Sellers is Stellar,"Peter Sellers sets the stage for all Pink Panther sequels to follow, with his performance in ""Return of the Pink Panther"". This production was a great improvement from the original ""Pink Panther"". The intrepid Inspector Clouseau is once again at the center of another high stakes criminal investigation that can only be solved by the world's greatest imbecile. And the French Inspector provides that requirement in full. Fans of the late Peter Sellers work will find this a must have for their DVD collection."
1,I find it's not funny at all.,"I find it's not funny at all. I don't know why British-style comedies usually do not attract me. So far, the only British comedies I like are Mr. Bean, Benny Hill show and Charlie Chaplin."
1,Artisan does it again,"Artisan has released yet another low quality DVD of a classic movie. Regardless of your feelings about Seller and the ""Panther"" series, this one is to be avoided, based solely on a non-anomorphic picture with the quality of an EP-recorded VHS tape and sound with a continual hiss throughout.Hopefully the original studio will see fit to give this movie a decent transfer in the future."
3,The Comeback of the Pink Panther,"Peter Sellers' triumphant return as Inspector Clouseau is the best aspect of this uneven 1975 sequel. Writer-director Blake Edwards has essentially remade ""The Pink Panther"" and ""A Shot in the Dark"" with an emphasis on lavish sight gags. As a result, the schizophrenic storyline never coheres into a satisfying whole. ""The Return of the Pink Panther"" might have worked better if David Niven and Capucine were able to reprise their original roles (Catherine Schell makes a pleasant Lady Litton, but Christopher Plummer is miscast as Sir Charles). Nevertheless, Sellers gives a brilliantly detailed performance in his third Clouseau outing - well-matched by Herbert Lom's eye-twitching Dreyfus. The animated credit sequence (courtesy of the Richard Williams Studio) is a knockout."
3,To complete your Pink Panther Collection...,"I have not purchased this DVD yet, but I plan to. It is the only Pink Panther movie not included in the Region 2 Pink Panther Box Set (available from amazon.co.uk as of 10 November 03). So, if you can play both Region 1 and Region 2 DVDs, and you want to have all of the movies, you will need to buy this in addition to the set. I have not found a Region 2 version of this movie, so this appears to be the only DVD for this title available at this time. I like this movie, and my rating is based on the movie itself - not anything technical about the DVD."
5,One of my favorites...,"The Pink Panther films are great... The ""Return"" is one of the best of the series, in my opinion. I highly recommend ""Strikes Again"" and ""Revenge"".Although there are no special features on this DVD, this film doesn't need special features and the typical cheap DVD [stuff] that other titles have; plus it keeps the price down."
2,Poor Quality and download speed.,"Poor Quality and download speed, also format for viewing is not available on Ipads. Need to improve to continue buying."
4,Made me snort Mr. Pibbs!!!,"Dan ""Wild Man"" Cockblockenship made me snort the soda, to be precise. Well, he didn't REALLY make me. He dared me.If it did it, I'd get to ride him to the video store. He lets me ride him lotsa places, though. I think he likes it. Weird.Oh well.Funny movie!"
5,Store review,Great Job!Movie was in like new condition...-No Scratches-No Marks of any sort-Not even a freakin finger printGot it to me in a decent amount of time-Couple days for shiping-Ordered it after business hours so they got to it the very next day and sent it out.
3,A few laughs,"Not as funny as the Panther Strikes Again. That was a non-stop laugh riot.Peter Sellers is the only funny part of this movie, and there are long, drawn-out, boring parts with straight characters Plummer and some other chickie.Boring.Should be more Sellers."
3,Vaaaa Vaaaa Voooom,The Return of the Pink PantherDVD ~ Peter SellersTell us what you think. Write a review of this item and share your opinions with others. Please be sure to focus your comments on the DVD. Read our review guidelines for more information. You can also look at some example customer reviews before you write your own.OK. Let's get started!
1,Disappointing video quality,A very good movie but the DVD quality is really disappointing compared to the rest of the Pink Panther series. It is just like watching a video copy.
2,DVD Picture Quality - TERRIBLE!,"No question, if you are a Peter Sellers fan this movie is a must-have. But why such a lousy transfer to DVD. My laserdiscs of ""Shot in the Dark"" and ""The Pink Panther Stirkes Again"" were much better. Now I'm completely gun-shy about buying these DVD's until someone improves their quality."
2,Bike Tire Pump Hose,One of the metal ends was not clasped properly and leaked at higher pressures (>50psi). I needed to re-crimp it myself. Not a quality product.
3,Bike pump replacement hose,"The item would not fit my very old Sunlite bike pump. I was, however, able to replace the broken lever on my old pump with the lever on the new hose."
5,"Biblical, Balanced Approach to Witnessing","This book broadens the Christian's view of witnessing, restoring it to a biblical perspective. For many years, believers have been misled to separate their influence upon souls from their influence upon society. The former has been encouraged, while the latter has been seen as undesirable. Minnery restores the biblical and historical balance by admonishing the church today to be both salt and light in a fallen world.The author emphasizes that for too long the church has remained silent regarding the moral decay surrounding it. While political involvement and social action are not the only means to make a difference, they are important means that believers have neglected in the last several decades.This book is a must-read for all Christians who desire to have a balanced, biblical approach to the society around them."
1,Save your Money,Very general documentation that does not give you the information required for a specfic Model. Do not waste your money!
2,Get ready to be disappointed,"This book is way too complex and goes into great detail on many procedures, but then does not contain any info on a guide of step-by-step basic maintenance. Will not do as a operations manual."
2,Eh.,"I bought this CD after hearing ""Seaside,"" which is a fantastic single. For that song, yes, the praise and comparisons others are raising here are quite appropriate. But....Well, to my ears the rest of the CD is indeed quite ordinary. I just couldn't get into it. The hooks just aren't there, the lyrics are awkward at best, and nothing stands out.So if you can buy ""Seaside"" as a single, do it. But I wouldn't recommend getting the CD, particularly at import price."
4,Anything but Ordinary!,"If there's one record I suggest you go buy this year, it has to be this great effort from The Ordinary Boys. The entire album is mint, but tracks like ""Little B****"", ""Talk Talk Talk"" and ""Maybe Someday"" will have you listening over and over again. What's interesting is that they seem to have thier own unique sound, you'll find it really hard to find a similar artist.In short, this album is well worth the money! Go buy it!"
4,Great Voice,"Renee has an amazing voice. I'm not a jazz fan, so I wont say much about this album, but the covers are really good and Renee has great potential to be the next greatest Jazz singer.Standout tracks include 'Summertime', 'Midnight at The Oasis' and 'Love That Will Last'."
5,"Woweee,wowzer","I bought this for my husband for Christmas and think that it went down very well ! Firstly, he couldn't believe that she is so young. He loved the style and arrangement, not conventional / tradtional jazz, he is a Diana Krall and Eva Cassidy fan, but he just thought this was fantastic. It was a first buy for this performer, but I would definitely buy another one. I couldn't find the CD in the UK, so had to buy it from the States, but what a hidden gem she is. A 10/10 AAAA +++++ score !Top Banana........................................"
3,fantastic voice,"What is it with all these incredibly talented underaged girls. Renee Olstead, Joss Stone and several others that I'm drawing a blank on are turning out some of the most soulful, sexiest music available today. A great selection of standards that benefit from the stylings of David Foster.She does a great take on Summertime, Taking a Chance on Love, Someone to Watch Over Me and What a Difference A Day Makes. If you like great female jazz vocal performances this is one to enjoy and a talent to watch"
4,Not Norah Yet !!,"Renee is good and can only get better but she's not ""Norah-esque"" yet.. a little time, life experience and self written material and who knows .. I like her though, I like her alot !"
2,A great singer at any age,"I am sure some people or going to attack this person because they don't like her music or her age or something to that effect. If you close your eyes and listen to her sing, you won't even notice anything like that. Reminds me of the attacks against the talents of Nora Jones by fans of Avril Langione. I love all kinds of music myself as well except maybe attack rap songs and a few others. I listen to the Motown Oldies station here at my job because that is about the only clear fm I can get.But this girl has been singing for a number of years and I am sure she was involved here in Houston with a number of local singing groups. A friend of mine said he recognized her from some of the vocal workshops he use to go to.She has a talent and knows how to display this to the audience which is where her acting talent comes in.You will be hearing her name for sometime.Brad"
5,Vocal Prodigy and Jazz Extraordinaire,"As a professional musician, pianist, and jazz band director at the middle and high school level I must say when I heard Renee sing ""Summertime"" on the Today Show Memorial Day morning I was in awe. Such an ""old soul"" in this young kid! She sings with such integrety and authenticity to the score. She breathes fresh life into standards such as ""Someone to watch over me"" and ""Meet me at midnight"" is simply amazing. She also has a phenomenal band backing her up. This is a fantastic album. You won't be disappointed. Listen to all the cuts on www.reneeolstead.com"
4,excellent CD,Surprizingly great CD; easy listening. Best kept secret. Will definitely purchase more of her. Hope she has a Christmas CD planned!Marilynn
4,Why on Earth is this girl doing sitcoms?,"Get this prodigy back into the studio forthwith. I defy you to listen to her sing Summertime, and not conclude its the best version since -- well, since Ella Fitzgerald. Oh, and then you find out how old she is (I won't even tell you), and your jaw drops.Her voice -- in turns sultry or world weary -- is far, far beyond her years. She has a major set of pipes, and can just ""own"" a song like very few modern singers of classic torch songs today can. Norah Jones and Diana Krall better start looking over their shoulders.Sure, you can quibble about the song selection (Midnight at the Oasis?) but this is a major talent with a killer voice. And the fact that the genuinely amusing ""Still Standing"" makes right wing moralists cringe is only an added bonus.This would have been a 5 star review, but some of the song selections are a bit soft"
3,Get back to us in 10 years,"I wasn't surprised to read that Ms. Olstead has been recording country music up until this venture into jazz. She has this annoying inflection where her voice breaks into the next octave which doesn't really work with this genre. She also lacks the life experience to really sing with real emotion although it's not for lack of trying. How much life experience can a pretty 15-year-old sitcom actress put into a song? The girl seriously needs a series of abusive relationships, substance addictions, and periods of depression. After that, she could be another Billie Holiday. Get back to us in 10 years sweetie."
2,Hated it!,"This is one the worst jazz cds, that I've ever heard. This girl doesn't have enough soul to backup these selections on her cd. I would strongly recommend that someone put this young one into the right music genre. She should be a pop singer, Britney Spears or Jessica Simpson."
5,RENEE WAS PUT ON THIS EARTH TO SING !,"I'm 15 just like Renee, I listen to a wide variety of music and I can name the great ones like Sinatra, Streisand, Fitzgerald and Vaughn. To this list I will now add Renee! She was born to sing and it shows in every last note. I think my generation has found it's greatest representative to the world of music. The CD is fantastic. Summertime will just about blow your mind. Is You Is Or Aint My Baby will grab you by the ear and spin you round. I Want A Love That Lasts is soothing and sweetly touching. Some to Watch Over Me is from another world! Breakin Up is Hard to Do makes the most out of this song. Sentimental Journey is a joy ride. Renee, if you read any of this you have made major fans out of people our own age. We will support you every step of the way!"
4,Refreshing,"This artist is a breath of fresh air amongst all the other singers of this genre. Her vocal ability, in this first album, is open and airy."
4,Go girl!,"Never heard of Renee before tonite. Sweet, effortless voice. Good choice in material. Gonna have to buy this CD. She's easy on the eyes, too."
5,Arrived as promised and ahead of schedule!,Arrived as promised and ahead of schedule! Renee Olstead has an amazing voice on any CD she releases.
5,Soul Medicine,"Everybody loves their daily commute to work...right? Well, listening to this young woman's voice helps you navigate your way through the life threatening hazards presented by drivers who wear their rectums as collars.As I listen Renee's sultry voice she makes me wish that the music--most of which were hits before I was born--she covers was still contemporary. Amazon delivered this dose of ""Soul Medicine"" for me this time and I'll be sure to look for more that Renee has to offer through them, but if this young performer ever comes to my area I'll be sure to catch her show."
5,Just awesome,"It's very rare to hear such wonderful talent from such a young person. Her voice is very strong for someone her age. You will be truly impressed. Her talent is very refreshing. When she sings ""Midnight At The Oasis"", she just makes your mind just float away. A true jazz lover will appreciate this. You'll just sit back and smile."
4,A stunning debut album!,"Have just listened to Renee Olstead's debut reprise recording and thought it first rate. As a senior from a musical family I love listening to standards. That this youngster can sing these songs so well is a stunning achievment! Excellent arrangements back Olstead admirably and showcase this young woman's talent. Liked everthing on the album, from the ballads to the swinging numbers. Especially liked ""Someone to watch over me: and ""Midnight at th Oasis."" I only hope that Renee will continue to mine the the standard catalog!"
5,A Voice like an angel !,"Rene Olstead combines the musical attributes of a Norah Jones, Jane Monheit, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and others in a sophisticated package which belies her young age. Her sense of time, phrasing, intonation , control and vocal embellishments make the 12 or so standards in this recording come to life with new found interest and excitement. The arrangements by the likes of Sammy Nestico and bassist John Clayton perfectly compliment her style, delivery and vocal nuances. Her security of time and pitch is beyond reproach. Her range is extensive but not overly contrived. She gives the impression that she really is having a ball with these evergreen standards. A bright shinning star in the making at the tender age of 14 !!!"
2,"Somebody should have like, hipped an editor, Lord and Lady.","Like so many bios today, there's a good book in here somewhere. But as wrought, Dig Infinity is an absurdly long, poorly edited work. Oliver gets all kinds of facts wrong and is egregious when it comes to people's names (Preston STURGIS? CINDY Miller for Donald O'Connor's sidekick instead of SIDNEY Miller? And that's just two). What a shame that such a great subject and such obviously hard work have actually done the impossible...made Lord Buckley boring. The best way to read this book is to skip much of Trager's endless and repetitive analysis of his Lordship's work and just peruse the oral histories."
5,A trustworthy primer,"The greatest roadblock in choosing alternative health approaches is the unknown. Not knowing the background and training of the author, healer or teacher you are considering can be extremely stressful. Choosing the wrong one can be disastorous. Valerie's background and training in western medicine gives her a credibility few others posses.Valerie's sage advice on a balanced approach to healthcare, i.e.: a team consisting of both western and alternative practitioners, makes sense. Kind of a ""don't throw the baby out with the bathwater"" approach.Simple and believable claims make this book easy to read and follow. I recommend it to all who are considering alternative approaches to western medicine."
4,Great Reference,"Great imformation & introduction into the world of Aromatheraphy. 100's of recipes with clear mixing & safety instructions. I've been reading lots of material on Aromatheraphy this one is my favorite. I refer to chap 15 - Blending How-To's every time I create a blend! This book will motivate you to start creating. I used 'Hearts & Roses Aromatheraphy 101 Kit' to get started, which includes 10 oils. I am looking to move on to essential oils that are not only 100% pure but are also ORGANIC (& more expen$ive). As Cooksley explains, these are chemical free (ie: no insecticides, etc. used in growing)...buy the book!"
5,big ray and the futuras are amazing,"i had chris neff (big ray) for a guitar teacher back in '99 at the music connection in beverly. i remember when i first got the airwaves cd. that was some inmpressive stuff to me when i was learning guitar. now that i have been playong guitar for about 4 years i really appreciate music more. surf songs are usually similar to one another but big ray and the futuras have a unique sound. even if you dont like surf music or instrumental rock, youll like bug ray and the futuras. especially if you play bass, guitar or drums."
2,Little taste or appeal.,"The pieces were very inconsistent. Some were okay, though still not great. A few tasted awful. Some were too dry and a few wet."
1,Avoid,"There is nothing Millet will not describe in blinding detail, from a phone call to a search for a Starbucks. And maybe if I cared about the protagonist, Ann, a little bit, I would want to wade through the endless descriptions. But I don't. Some people thought this book was funny, but to me, it seemed like it was ""funny:"" what a person without a sense of humor thinks people will laugh at. Avoid this book."
3,Not a bad-looking book,"This book is solid and well-proportioned. It may seem a bit big, but I didn't have a hard time reading it on the subway.Without the nuke-kitsch dust jacket, this one would be a nice addition to your shelf. The canvas is a nice, deep red, and the lettering on the spine is gold.The paper has a good weight to it, too.I might have given it an extra star, but the spine is a little creaky, which made me cringe every time I opened it."
2,"I dislike being a downer, but","I didn't even finish this. And before you discount my review entirely, it's worth acknowledging that I was more than halfway through it at the time I gave up. Around page 270 the main plot was just being introduced, for starters. The constant back and forth of Hiroshima/Nagasaki and present day was very distracting, and the way dialog was set up was very confusing at times. It just dragged, and I couldn't make myself push through to the end, especially when it took so long to get as far as I did. I was disappointed, in both the book and myself. I don't like not finishing books, but I had to cut it loose."
4,what a concept,the premise of this book is HUGE. who wouldn't want to return to the future and atone for the consequences of their decisions. Ms Millett presents us with the the inventors of the atomic bomb returning to see the legacy of the Manhattan project. The characterizations are faithful to the personalities of the scientists and their interactions with the disparate personalities and politics of the late 20th century are at times comic and tragic. I recommend this book highly and perhaps our current politicians could take note and consider their legacy.
5,One of the Great Events of our Time,"I am reading the book now because of the movie, which is one of my top three movies of all time. Amazing true story."
1,BEWARE.....NOT for Cassiopia E100,I just bought this GPs system and it does not work. It says on the box that its for Cassiopia E100 and also on the Pharos web page but it is not for that as the software that comes with it is for Win Ce 3.0 only. Cassiopia E100 is WinCe 2.11 (and its not upgradeable) so in short its false advertisment.I tried to talk to Pharos but no help or reply. Tried to download the older version...its not available.I will most probably return it as it useless to me. Very Very disappointed.
2,GPS feature is fine. Comes with outdated Ostia Navigator,"The system works good with E-125. Only and very disapponting thing is that the package contains an older version of Ostia Navigator software, which is about 4 years old on maps and extremely limited on POI and visual directions.You would have to get newer mapping software to get the most benefits from the GPS. This is a considerable expence."
5,A Contrarian's View of Dylan,"Highway 61 Revisited is not nearly as good as Bringing It All Back Home but still an amazing album. More fun up-tempo blues numbers: ""Tombstone Blues"", the title track, ""It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry"", and ""From A Buick 6"" (two more great titles!). ""Like A Rolling Stone"" deserves its reputation as an all-time rock'n'roll classic. Bob is stretching with ""Ballad Of A Thin Man"" and it works. Creepy and funny, it's my favorite song on the album. Side two is a problem though. Other than the title track, it's filled with somewhat tedious, mid-tempo, too long excuses for clever lyrics: ""Queen Jane Approximately"", ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"" and ""Desolation Row"". ""Desolation Row"" even features the return of that incessantly jamming slightly off-key guitar from ""It's All Over Now"". Sure, nothing could be as good as it, but highway 61 Revisited is still a worthy follow-up to Bringing It All Back Home."
5,Classic Dylan,"A hundred years from now, this album - in all its ragged glory - will be held up along with the Dead's American Beauty as an example of what American rock music was all about. Pure poetry, pure Dylan."
3,"Sorry, but he STILL can't sing","Dylan's voice is the most parodied one in rock. Don't get me wrong, I love his songs and think he is one of the best composers ever. But the guy's voice just grates on my nerves something terrible. Always has and always will. Why do think there are so many cover versions of his songs? It's not just because he wrote great songs. It is also because other artists knew that they could make them sound more palatable. I know I am in the minority among all of you other Dylan freaks, but there a quite a few that feel the same. And to each his own opinion. OK, pal?"
3,Is too much overrated,"Five stars... I can't see (neither understand) the reason why. I've given many oppotunities to this album (in this very moment I'm giving it one more), expecting each time to hear what is in it that makes a lot of people happy-yelling about it... For me it's got one good song followed by another boring one. The goods are WONDERFUL indeed, and the borings are crispy and extremely poor arranged... For me it's a long long way between this album and the almost perfect ""Subterranean Homescik Blues"" or the glorius ""Bolde on Blonde"". Anyway, there's no account for taste."
1,SACD?,"After reading most of the customer reviews for this SACD, I have to ask:Has anybody who DOES own the compatible multi-channel SACD player and amplifier noticed that the music is playing through only the front left & right speakers? I have only a couple of other SACDs and I played them to be sure everything was working correctly. Sure enough, the equipment was correct.Maybe the disc I have is faulty. A friend loaned it to me. He doesn't have SACD compatible equipment but loves Dylan, so bought the new discs just because.Many of the reviews on Amazon state ""I don't even have a SACD player, but this new release sounds amazing!"" I just want to ask if anybody else is NOT getting any multi-channel experience on this particular disc.For the record, the songs themselves are essential Dylan. I'm interested in reviews of this disc from those who are qualified to review it in its SACD format."
5,One for the Dead,"This '65 classic epitomized Dylan's rise from the counter culture folk spokesman, to folk rocks poster child. From the 1st track, which would become rocks longest playing number one single, to the last poetic verse, this album would gain Dylan a whole new audience. Although the sounds of his electric rythms were not well received at the Newport Folk Festival, this album quickly regained some folk purists, and placed Mr Dylan at the forefront of groundbreaking sounds in rock and roll. Many songs on this album would eventually become staples for another group, the Grateful Dead. Any dead head worth his stash, will rekindle beautiful memories of shows long gone, as they listen to this disc."
5,Can an album influence a life? This one did.,"Another review at this point is probably pointless. Nonetheless, I feel compelled to put in my two cents, since I bought this album 27 years ago. At that time, I was astounded that the human mind (and one 24 years old, to boot) could conceive of something like ""Desolation Row."" The song still astounds me. This album encouraged me to play the guitar and write songs. Likewise, it influenced the way I thought and lived. It remains for me the greatest album ever released, and one of the greatest works of art of the 20th century."
4,"Clean sound, but...","Yup, it's Dylan alright, sounding better than my 40 year old LP! I bought the SACD version and am impressed with the clarity of sound, but was a bit disappointed in that the SACD layer (also has a regular CD layer) is only 2 channel - NOT multi-channel. But if you have good front speakers, you won't be disappointed in the improved sound quality: the harmonica in""Like a Rolling Stone"" and honky tonk style piano in""It Takes a Lot To Laugh, etc."" and ""Ballad of a Thin Man"" are especially noticeably better than on the LP. The SACD version is even clearer and more intense, making me wonder why they didn't put a multi-layer (5.1) on the hybrid CD."
5,Highway 61 Revisited,One of Dylans absolute great albums. This is a must have for any music fan and especially anybody who's into Bob Dylan. This vinyl cut sounds great and really brings the album to life. I would definately reccomend this LP.
5,My first Dylan album!,"About 3 years ago I heard Like A Rolling Stone on Kansas City's oldies station. I knew that regardless of how good the rest of the stuff on the album is, I had to have it. So the next day I bought it, and I was blown away!Every track is a masterpiece. Like A Rolling Stone is my favorite, but all of the songs are perfect. And will be well worth any price you pay for it. I could go on and on about how great this album is but I'll just simplify it and say: BUY IT NOW YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
5,great album,This is another great album from Dylan. Every song is just amazing. I especialy love the 12 minute ending song 'desolation row'. Classic Dylan.
5,"If you don't know, now you know","If you thinking of buying a Dylan record, pick this one up. The entire album is made up of tracks that you automatically think of when you think of Dylan."
3,an historical curiosity,"Unlike its brilliant successor ""Blonde On Blonde"", this record has not withstood the ravages of time. One can't help cringing now at the way, way out of tune harmonica in ""Queen Jane Approximately"". One listens to ""From a Buick 6"" and immediately forgets it. Well, the lyric to ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"" is well-crafted and reasonably restrained, but if ""even negativity won't pull you through"", I don't why you'd want to torture yourself with it again. Elsewhere Mr. Dylan is ""lookin' to git silly"".Recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
4,Dylan plays the blues,"This is the only Dylan album I have. I love this album for many reasons, firstly for Dylan himself, but also because you hear Mike Bloomfield on guitar and Al Kooper on organ. Bloomfield and Cooper occasionally get to show their stuff. Dylan is capable of playing the blues and 'Ballad of a Thin man' and 'Desolution row' show what he was capable of. After more than 30 years, this album still hits the spot."
4,The First Blonde on Blonde,"This album was the first all electric Dylan album, and I think of it as the rough cut of Blonde on Blonde. It has a handful of gems, and no filler, which was rare in the 60's except to The Beatles and a handful of others. Besides ""Like A Rolling Stone"", the other gems are ""Tombstone Blues"" ""It Takes A Lot to Laugh..."" and ""Queen Jane Approximately"", which is probably my favorite song on here. Not too far behind are ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"" and ""The Ballad of A Thin Man"". Overall I give it 4 stars because it doesn't have enough classic material to be 5, but it is still a great album and a must have for fans of folk-blues music."
5,just buy it,just buy it. it is worth it. the first song is worth the cost of the entire album. you almost forget to listen the rest cause you just keep repeating the first song. then you hear the rest and you just have to sit down or pull off to the side of the road so you can reclaim your mind.
3,I'd download it.,"Bob Dylan is definitely influential in the world of music. I know a lot of people that listen to him everyday. His voice can be a little grating, but if you listen to his words, they can really say something. This album is really good lyrically. But the recording quality is a joke. Too bad because it would've gotten a 5 star if it wasn't so bad."
2,"impressively venomous, but what's it about?","The ""poet laureate"" of rock 'n roll. Pity he was so successful and revered. He set the precedent that doomed rock 'n roll to always being a semantic eunuch. Bob Dylan and the Beatles: overrated technicians, forever evading meaning, and never embracing it. ""Savage, meaningless sarcasm"", as I read in Spy Magazine once. I guess if he had spoken his mind more directly, that would have hurt sales too much, right Bob? ""Gotta be good looking, 'cause you're so hard to see""."
3,"not lame, not the best","Although a good album, it definently is not great. none of the other tracks trancend the awesomeness of ""Like A Rolling Stone"", and some of it actully sounds like(Gasp!, God Forbid!) country, but it is still a pretty decent album.If you must know, I took it down a star because of the country. I hate country"
2,"no Bob, the sun is NOT chicken, it's a chicken egg","Album way over-rated by the worshippers. This guy breaks wind and the sycophants can't wait to praise it to the sky.Want to buy a great album by this singer/songwriter? Get THE ESSENTIAL BOB DYLAN. Want to read something truly terrific by him? Get CHRONICLES, Volume One."
2,One of the most overrated artists of all time,"In my time I've asked many many Bob Dylan fans what it is that appeals to them so much. The result is invariable. they say ""The lyrics man,the WORDS. Dylan is a lyrical genius. He's a genius poet"" Well if it's the words you love so much why not just visit a lyrcis database on the internet and just print off your favourite song lyrics instead of spending piles of your hard earned cash listening to second rate folk and roots music? I hope you found this money saving tip helpful."
5,there is bob dylan and then there is everybody else,"this is the absolute TRUTH on REALITY. bob dylan mixes up surrealism, symbolism (from rimbaud)and good old fashioned rock 'n roll to make on of the seminal albums of the lifetime of rock 'n roll. he mixes up a tremendous lyrical beat, wild frenzy and articulated truth in his lyrics to make a classic that will stand the test of time for as long as time goes on. along with blonde on blonde, and bringing it all back home, he reached the absolute pinnacle of describing real reality in poetical terms. in all his later albums, he would never attain this wild greatness again."
4,Not Multichannel,I really like this CD but the problem I have with Amazon is that they don't tell you on their CD page whether it is Multi-channel or simply Stereo SACD.Isn't there someone there with the knowledge to put it on the website so we know?I prefer Multi-channel SACD's myself. If anyone else is going through the frustration that I have try checking the artists home page for better info.
1,Sorry I bought it,Thought I'd give it a try because it is listed as one of the all time great albums. Tried reading the liner notes on the CD and the words made no sense at all. Listened to the CD and kept hoping it would get better and it didn't. Trying to understand his songs was a waste of time for me because what he was saying was either way over my head or it just didn't make any sense. I'll keep plugging along trying some other artists. I will not ever buy another Bob Dylan CD. I think he must have been high when he wrote these songs.
1,absurd nonsense!,"If this is ""a great statement by the ""poet of the times,"" are we ever in trouble! Absurd lyrics about siameses cats, laundry mats, Quizimodo, Einstein being Robin Hood, drainpipes... some clown blowing a whistle thruout the title song, some wheezy harmonica blowing thruout, and lest we forget, Dylan doesn't sing, he drones! How any sane person can defend this lunacy is beyond me. There are a great many 5 star albums out there by other artists, but this is a joke!"
1,Overated,The most over rated musisian in Music history to do crappyRolling Stones list Elvis Presley is #1 not #3 lets seesome dude that sounds just like Barney and believe meBarnie is a Million times better is so old Hay-Huh-Who-Wa thatis some of the great samples on this album wow
1,Absurded Lunacy!,"One big giant dud! Insane lyrics, horrible singing (I guess its singing), and how can we forget the talented musician who keeps blowing a whistle thruout the title track!Spend your money wisely, BUY A BEATLE ALBUM INSTEAD!!!"
1,"Oh,please..............","I cannot believe some of the hype surrounding this album and this artist.Nobody did what Dylan did in 1965? Really? Did Dylan have a number one song? NO.A number one album? NO.1965 belonged to the Beatles,followed by the Stones and other great acts,not this guy.Another review says Dylan is a great singer...yeah,and I'm a billionaire.Gimmie a break,please."
1,*Snore*,"Yawn! Why is this album in such high regard? It's crap. It's just a commercial computer manufactured pile of flaming poo. The guy can't even play guitar! He only knows how to play two chords. I think it's about time someone showed this hack to write music- Fred Durst, perhaps?"
5,Classic Blues driving rock n roll Dylan,"Arguably the greatest rock n roll album ever made. The rhythms are super tight, energetic, and tension filled. Not only does it have like a rolling stone on it but the other 8 songs are classcis to. And I just love how Dylan is Socially commentary on this album and getting away with it. And the album cover knocks me out with that psychedelic shirt and that rebelious grin on his face. This album helped changed the face of rock n roll forever and all the doors were open to sing about anything your heart desires. Best of all Dylan showed he could rock n roll with the best of them."
5,"one of bob's best, if not the best","I would consider highway 61 probably bob's best album. a lot of people would say that goes to blonde on blonde or blood on the tracks, but i think 61 just has something that separates it from the other two. of course, like a rolling stone is probably one of bob's best written and best played songs, and highway 61 and queen jane have a really great feel to them. and desolation row is just a great song to complete the album. plus, his harmonica playing has to be the best on this album than any other. the band is also really awesome, especially on rolling stone and buick 6. well, that about covers it. anybody who reads this should go out and buy this album right now."
5,Genius.,"Bob Dylan, in perhaps his angriest album, stuns the listener with his genius. What beats this? Nothing, although maybe Blonde on Blonde approaches it."
5,A Classic,"It's always interesting how different readers can react so differently to the same book. Unlike some of the reviewers below, I found Rationalism in Politics to be gracefully written and vastly more learned and interesting than most political philosophy these days. It's a great book for a rainy afternoon, with essays that can be read (and reread) in any order, illuminating every subject they touch on, whether Hobbes, or poetry, or historiography. Oakeshott was pigeon-holed as a ""conservative"" during his life but his thought is too wide-ranging and nuanced to be shoved into simple categories. He was not as profound or influential as Isaiah Berlin, another great philosophical essayist -- but anyone who likes philosophical and political essays will enjoy and learn from this book."
5,A Heartwarming Read-Aloud,"A wonderful picture book introduction to Madeleine L'Engle's Austin family. The story of staying true to yourself and supporting family and friends is simply told through the eyes of young Vicky. This beautiful story makes you want to form your own ""Anti-Muffins"" club."
1,Useless bagpipes,"Pakistani-made bagpipes. That's all I have to say to that. They do not tune well, are very cheaply machined, and have poor tone. The chanter is tuned very flat. You couldn't play in a band with one of these. Not a bad concept, as bagpipes are very expensive, but it's better to wait a bit and spend your money on a good instrument."
2,"Ok for engery, worse attention.. 500mg is TOO high of a dose","First of all 500 mg is too high of dose, and they should not recommond 2(1000mg)...i took one, and felt a energy, headache, and could not fall a sleep... it does not seem to be helping much with attention...however it does gives you engergy if you are feeling like not getting up doing ur daily work...."
1,"Horrible, unworkable program-AVOID","If you want MORE STRESS with your tax preparation, just try using this worthless program.Last year I tried to download Turbo Tax for California and the program just wouldn't run correctly so this year I bought the CD. It doesn't work either and Intuit's ""help"" is worthless. The state program refuses to import some of the data from the federal program, and won't let me input the data either. So Turbo Tax keeps telling me I owe money when in fact the state owes me a refund. This is after I had to, once again, download interminable files because the state edition was released before it was ready.I will avoid this product in the future. It's a waste of time and money."
1,terrible,have to jump through rebates to obtain state product with deluxe. deluxe did not have necc coupon and had to waste 2 hours to finally talk to a person to figure out what to do next.
4,"Good, Inexpensive Mirror","This mirror was good and cheap. Installation was quick and it looks good even thought it is on a white car. I must admit I was a little worried that it would look out of place, but using the matte finish panel that came with it, it blends right in. It did take quite a while to get shipped to my house, that's why I gave it a four star. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars."
1,Took only 20 pictures per charge on an SD1000,charged ok in charger but would only do about 20 pictures. The cannon unit will take 200+. Tried multiple times. Not recommended.
3,Not bad....,"The recipes are simple, the ""full color pictures"" are very small of the top of a bar/brownie.There is one recipe that is missing an ingredient, that I have found so far.Nice book for the price."
1,IMPOSSIBLE to get popsicles out!,"I've tried these twice now, and I don't think I'll try them again. I thought that you'd be able to bend and pull at the molds to release the popsicles, but no matter how much I pull, they still won't come loose. Out of 12 popsicles, I've only managed to get two of them out with the stick still in the middle, and that was only after lots of pulling and tugging at the mold and after running them under hot water for a minute. Even after all that, the stick came out on its own for the rest of them.I think the real problem is that the silicone for the molds is too thick to be very flexible, and the inside of the molds is not as smooth as the outside (and nowhere near as smooth as the silicone muffin cups I have). So, the popsicles end up sticking.I'm sending this off to charity. Maybe someone else can make it work, but I think it's worthless. I really wanted to like this because I much prefer to not have a plastic mold, but these aren't workable for me."
4,this is a great mold,"I am very happy with my purchase, popsicles are easily removed and the mold went through my dishwasher like a champ."
3,"Good, not great.",Once the popsicles are frozen they are a little difficult to get out. It works for what it is though.
5,What in the world is unique anymore?,"Jeff Dahl is. While it reminds me of lots of great bands, this album stands on it's own in being so unique. Thanks Jeff!"
5,great buy.,sharp. glossy. brilliant. looks very nice out of the box without me having to adjust settings and use included software. fairly affordable. dual DVI / VGA output. stylish design (although the base can be improved.)
4,Best in class,"Quite simply, this is an excellent monitor for the price. I purchased similarly-priced monitors just prior to the 216bw (an Acer and a Viewsonic), and this monitor outshined the two in every way.Visually, the default brightness is high, sure, but it takes a second to lower it (I went down to 20). I just calibrated to match my monitor at the office (I do graphic design), and while I didn't expect it to look quite as nice as the Apple 23"" cinema at work, it comes pretty close. It's half the price of the Apple 20"", so I can't complain.Oh, and the build quality is excellent. Looks very high-end. I would much rather have this in my living room than the budget Acer monitor."
4,"very good monitor, except...","This is an excellent monitor overall, with excellent price. It is true that it comes with bright factory settings, like others have mentioned, but not a problem since you can adjust it very easily. No need for all the software. It's so easy to adjust using the monitor buttons. Also comes with both digital and analog cables. Also didn't need to install the extra cover on the back for the cables. The reason for the 4 stars is because of a dead pixel on the lower left side. Otherwise it would have been an easy 5 stars all the way."
5,Gotta Love Samsung,"Monitor is wonderful! Great price through Amazon - cheaper than any other company I looked at when I purchased it. Monitor matches our television set because it is a Samsung and black in color - looks very stylish. The montior screen is immense, yet thin and fits perfect on our office desk. It makes all visuals look clear and precise. Easy to install! We love Samsung and this monitor just adds another reason why we will continue purchasing Samsung electronics."
5,Fantastic Monitor,"Previous reviewers have included accurate technical data and analysis, so I'll just keep this simple and say that, after looking at a lot of different options, I went with this Samsung and I couldn't be happier. This thing looks great even when it's turned off! It completely changes the computer experience from my old CRT monitor. You can adjust it until you're satisfied. Video games look superb (my kids play LEGO STAR WARS 2 on it). 22 inches can cost up to $100 more, and for what, 0.4 inches more screen width?"
4,john wayne biography,Book started out a little slow but as it went along it became a more interesting read. I do recommend it for any John Wayne fans.
4,Excellent short biography,"British writer Michael Mann turns his attention to John Wayne in this relatively short 386 page biography. Mann is a prolific biographer having done bios of Frank Sinatra, Charlton Heston, Gregory Peck, etc.Mann writes well and incorporates his own research and experience with quotes from many of the people who worked closely with Wayne during his 50+ year career.There isn't a lot here you will not have already read elsewhere, although Mann seems to endlessly drone on about a Russian plot against Wayne's life and Wayne's ""off the books"" work for the OSS during World War 2.The reader looking for a short easy to read biography will find this book a good choice."
3,Great Characters from Shakespeare Paper Dolls,These were beautiful but we had to cut them out ourselves. They had very fine area's to cut around so not really conducive for young children except if mom helps.
1,Not worth the time and effort,"I wanted more light in my dorm room and bought this lamp. The package arrived missing a part that was necessary to install the lamp shade, so I had to send it back for an exchange. I got a package that had all the parts but after I set it up, the lamp started tilting to one side. On one occasion, I touched the lamp pole and accidentally knocked the lamp over and all the lightbulbs shattered. This lamp is not very stable. The lamp shades get VERY hot (unbearable to touch). Also, keep in mind that the lamp you get won't look like the one shown on Amazon. The one I got was more of a dark grey, not the shiny light grey shown in the picture. I was very disappointed with this purchase. It is definitely not worth the money."
1,Next to Useless,"This is not a book, just a laminated, folding pamphlet. The title does indicate it is a ""Basic"" guide, but being new to field hockey, I assumed it would still be helpful. What a joke. The basic information includes such facts as (1) The players wear uniforms and use a stick and ball (2) The object of the game is to score goals and the team that scores the most goals wins and (3) the refs make calls. It has a section titled ""Common referee signals"", but does not illustrate the signals nor describe them! Don't waste your time on this next to useless ""book""."
2,"Informative, if skimpy","I bought this for my mother, who comes to watch all my games. I was a little disappointed because it isn't as substantive as it looks on Amazon. It does still have a clear lay out of the field and basic information."
3,Fairly good,"This reproduction of the classic book by Munro is a good reference if text is important. Most illustrations are fair and several pages are incorrectly copied , distracting from the image as printing in reverse over the illustrations and too dark, undecipherable images detract from the usefulness as a prime reference."
1,"Decent tips, but there's better available","I am just starting to learn to slackline, and had see this video at REI. It was a big disappointment, though. A good chunk of the video is dedicated to cool tricks, which are fun to see, but they're cheaper on youtube! In addition, I bought a Gibbon slackline that is ready to set up, so the ""setup"" part of the DVD was not very helpful (they use webbing, not a ready kit). I also found that the ""how to"" portion was somewhat lacking. The five minute video I watched on Gibbon's Facebook page on Slacklining 101 was much more helpful. I was really excited that this DVD might talk about ""moving meditation"" as I've been learning to meditate as well. Meditation wasn't mentioned one single time, nor was there any instruction. I would suggest just digging into youtube for free advice and tips rather than spend any money on this DVD."
3,Dissapointment,"The first five songs rock and the rest of the album is mellow. The original shout was much heavier, especially the ""in you face Album. The new new Tamplin and Friends Cd "" Wake the Nations"" released in 2003 is mch better"
2,Inaccurate preposterous information ruins what could have been great,"What could have been a great novel was instead ruined for me by its much misinformation about mormons and latter-day-saint culture as a whole, as well as the preposterous part that the mormon church played in the plot. Not recommended."
4,"Great speakers, if you can get it at the right price...","The sound is amazingly good for speakers of this size, and the construction is solid. It can replace a cheap pair of computer desktop speakers (without subwoofer) anytime. It even comes with an AC adapter. The manufacturer's suggested price however was way too high. I got this discontinued model at 60% off, so I suggest you wait for the big discount when the current model is discontinued. If you can't wait, and your budget is limited, you might want to consider other models like the Creative TravelSound 200, which being a smaller unit, might has somewhat weaker bass."
2,Not for those new to the saint...,"This book was the first that I had ever read about St. Francis - and in that context, it stunk. In the first few pages you repeatedly read ""Well, since everyone knows about the (whatever) incident, I won't describe it, but it affected Francis like this..."" This continues throughout the entire volume, and left me wondering why I had bothered to read the book. If you are already well acquainted with St. Francis, this book may interest you, although the author's ""smarter than thou"" ego bleeds through the pages. It does have a lot of information which claims to be absent in other works on the saint, but aside from that, I would not recommend the book. If you are looking for an introduction to St. Francis, look elsewhere."
4,A very good and HONEST book!,"I do not understand a previous reviewer's comments (that of Christopher Alsruhe). He writes: "" This book gets 5 stars for exposing the truth of Francis of Assisi, and 1 star for being a book that can be trusted to lead people into the truth of the Bible."" This book is not intended to be a source for leading people into the truth of the Bible. It is a BIOGRAPHY about Francis. Nothing more! Learn the difference.This book digs into Francis's past and tells the truth very well. I have read Chesterton's biography of Francic and it does ""clean up"" Francis's past and focuses on what people would like to read about him. The interesting note here is that most men of the cloth, whether in the distant past or today, have a little of Francis's sordid history in them. Being a cleric, or man of the cloth, does not absolve one's past or guarantee a clean future."
4,general comment,Turkle's book is one of the first ethnographies published on virtual communities and how we construct and reconstruct our senses of identity through the internet. It is therefore an important starting point for anyone with a general interest in this area research. Since this book was originally published however there has been a significant amount of work done on virtual communities and self-identity on the WWW that differs somewhat from Turkle's. Therefore although I highly recommend the book I also suggest that you take the time to explore this subject area more broadly before drawing any conclusions.
2,The continuation of a fallacy.,"Turkle's book is a good read, but can not be taken as authorative. She seems to have fallen into the same trap as most of the online researchers do. Turkle expresses her findings as though they come from a similar group of online people. The Internet is filled with various groups and ideologies. Cross-cultural comparison is fine, but considering everyone online as the starting point for an argument is just asking for disaster. It is because of this that Sherry and many others like her have written books that are good for a read but useless academically."
4,Excellent... A Very Eclectic and Intelligent Book,"Turkel's book combines the best of her research in psychoanalysis, computer technology, and sociology. A readable and thought-provoking work for academics and general public. Timely subject-matter, with a po-mo focus that will make it interesting even in a few years when the technological references will be dated. Somewhat over-emphasizing the Usenet and MUD elements of Internet, with less on the World Wide Web. Highly recommended for those interested in exploring philosophical questions related to ""being"" in the computer age"
2,Postmodernist vagueries and mostly trivial observations,"If reading postmodernist types of things turns you on, you'll like this book. The author talks a lot about how computers have moved from ""modernist calculation"" to ""postmodernist simulation."" Why there is a need to attach the modernist-postmodernist modifiers to calculation and simulation is never explained, and I suspect it is just done to give the book a tres chic intellectual veneer. As with nearly all authors who use the term, the author does not define ""postmodernism"" or explain what it has to do with anything in her book. Also a lot of vague talk about how ""people didn't used to like to do"" such and so a thing with computers but now ""people like to do"" such and so something other thing with computers a lot more. No data of course, that would offend the postmodernists reading the book. An important - VERY important - topic treated in a shabby manner."
3,Mark McGuire,You said he could have been as big as Mark McGuire? I do not thing Roger took steroids my friend!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Too many mistakes,"Although it was written in a very conversational manner, it has more typographical errors than I've ever seen in a book. I wished I had counted them as I went, but did not. However, there were quite a few. This inattention to detail made me wonder whether or not the author made factual errors. In addition, it was republished in 2002, but not updated. I am a huge Roger Maris fan, but I was fairly disappointed with the book."
3,interesting alternative versions of familiar songs,"A more relaxed album than Mistakes, this one contains several familiar songs from that album, as well as interesting new material."
5,Amber is Back!,"After scoring a minor hit in 1996 with her debut, ""This Is Your Night"", Amber is back with her 2nd great opus, self-titled ""Amber"". I knew I wanted this cd after listening to Sexual. I was not disappointed at ALL! These songs are fantastic! Amber tries to expand her horizons a little, dipping into disco (Above the Clouds, Don't Wanna Stop), house (Love One Another, Without You), trance (Sexual), latin (Let's Do It For Love), and even Pop/R&B (I Found Myself In You, If I'm Not The One, Spiritual Virginity). Critics may not have received this album well, but I sure did. Amber is a great artist who is just trying to find her niche in the music world."
4,This is your Amber,"I'm so glad this CD is out. It has been a long wait well worth it. My favorite songs are #s 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10. They all have my favorite elements; great production, fine vocals, nice message and the beauty of Amber throughout. If you get a chance buy this and while you're at it buy Tina Cousins ""Killing Time"" as well."
5,A MUST BUY CD!,"If I can only buy 2 CDs for this year....one will be ""Cher"" and the other will be ""Amber""! I have been waiting for 3 years for ""Amber""....I saw her life @ a club....it was so good! ""Sexual"" is so very good! ""Love one another"" is the best! We must own these 2 CDs!"
4,"Amazing, simply amazing....","I bought this album- and was enthralled. This is a well put together second album.I also saw her live (she was doing a club circuit tour in the US) and she is good live as well.And Sexual- well, let's just say after hearing that.... *grins*"
5,Sexual (Li Da Di),"I was driving down the highway one rainy afternoon feeling a little blue and Sexual (Li Da De)came on. I had never heard it before. While listening, I knew this was a magic song designed to wake up the woman in me. I felt more beautiful and incredibly amourous after listening. The music makes me want to get up and dance my desire away."
3,A Diva With An Average Voice,"I was listening to the radio one day when I heard the song, Sexual. I fell in love with that song, and had to know who sung it. I later found out it was Amber. I then bought this album, and listened to all of the songs. Sexual is an outstanding track, but the rest are okey. Her vocals aren't that great, and she sort of whines in some of the songs. Other than that, the songs are great to dance to. If you enjoy listening to dance music, then you should get this CD."
3,Not bad... but not great,"I bought this album for the excellent 'Sexual' but I was pretty dissapointed with the rest. Although there are some great beats and music and it functions well as background music, the lyrics left some to be desired. I don't mind bad lyrics but some of these were so simplistic that they got in the way of my enjoyment of the beat. It's worth buying but don't expect an album of tracks equal to 'Sexual'"
4,The cd is perfect for people who love pop music.,"This cd, I just bought a few days ago, is very good, it really is. I originally bought it for her song Sexual on it, but the other songs, they are good too. There are two versions of Sexual on the cd, both are sweet."
3,"Great voice, needs better lyrics.","Amber has a fantastic voice, but the lyrics leave something to be desired. Also, some of the songs are not the most flattering for her; e.g. some are old songs redone poorly (Cat's Cradle remix), and another song sounds like it could be out of RENT, or some other musical. Although it may be a way to diversify her genres, it is a weak attempt, and does nothing to showcase her voice. Amber - be more selective next time."
4,Strong Second Effort,"Amber's self-titled second effort improves greatly on alot of the hit-or-miss material present throughout her debut disc THIS IS YOUR NIGHT. From the opening 'Above The Clouds' to the album-ending Thunderpuss-remixed 'Sexual', it's all about dancing here, which is just fine considering that Amber, though possessed of a nice voice, doesn't have the vocal range of fellow club queens Kristine W or Ultra Nate and thus wisely for the most part avoids the ballad arena. She does, however, slow down the tempo a bit on both 'Spiritual Virginity' and 'Object Of Your Desire'--to great effect--and the production throughout is not nearly as Euro-centric as it was on the previous set. Other standouts on the set include 'Don't Wanna Stop', the aforementioned 'Sexual', and her 54 collboration with Ultra Nate and Jocelyn Enriquez on 'If You Could Read My Mind'. All in all, a strong, hook-filled set from an artist who doesn't get nearly enough exposure."
4,very difficult to use,this book is very hard to use. When I bought this book I had no expirence in egyptian hieroglyphs this book probably would be better for someone who has a knowledge of some grammar and wocab. it would be a good review book for the expirenced.
2,Very Bad Product - Arrived smashed. Poor Packing.,Would NEVER buy from this seller again. The board came broken in two. Very poor packaging. Buyer beware.
4,Good for my special purpose,"I use these as platforms for stereo speakers and amplifiers. Not the highest quality marble but still very heavy and much cheaper than ""audiophile"" amp and speaker stands. However I'd be very careful about buying them mail order. I bought mine in a kitchen supply store and half of the ones there were broken in the boxes. They're certainly just fine for rolling pastry dough but make sure they're well packed for shipping, or get them in a store where you can take them out of their boxes and inspect them."
5,"Great value, great interface.","This item is all it says it is. Small, lightweight, easy to use (the jog dial and record button above it are all you need!), and a not too complicated LCD interface. Recording capacity (and options) are terrific. It's easy to play back, erase (but not TOO easy - you have to hit ERASE and then confirm by hitting ERASE again), and record files. The built-in microphone is VERY powerful (no need to hold the unit anywhere near your mouth, or head for that matter!). This truly could be used to record meetings, etc. The playback volume is extremely powerfull as well (and powered only by 2 AAA batteries). I only wish Olympus made a case / cover available for this item, and provided an optional hands-free mic."
2,Nope,"Family didn't like it all. Said the meatball looked like a potato.and I think they're right. Too bad, because it's just what I was looking for."
2,The subject was the only good thing,"As a true Doors fan and a knowlegable Jim Morrison studier, I felt that this author took a bad approach to this book. I disliked how Jim was portrayed as just some drug addicted kid who happened tobe born with an above average IQ. If you like the Doors as much as I do, I recomend you stay away from this book as you will end up angry with the author for his bad judgment."
5,Spectacular kitchen knife,This is a beautiful kitchen addition. It's different enough to demand experimentation. It's big when you want big. It is stable when you need chop to fine julienne.5-star on utility and value.
5,Not pulp fiction!,"A refreshing relief from the ""true psychic experiences"" pulp. Scholarly discussion of many scientific phenomena."
4,Prius Hitch,"You would think as long as they have been making this hitch, they could get the spacing on the bolts correct. I put it on myself and didn't raise the car up. It isn't real easy, I used my foot to hold up the other end while I bolted it in. I had to take it down because the holes didn't line up and hit it with a sledge hammer. I had to do this a couple of times to get it right.Have someone help you, and don't do it when it's 98 deg's like I did."
4,Does what it needs too,"Came super quick with two day shipping. Was really easy too install, just a couple of bolts and modifying a place cover. Took only 45 mins to install with simple hand tools. Why would I put a hitch on a prius? When you already have a hitch bike carrier, this was still cheaper and better. Came with all the hardware and simple directions, hard to mess this one up."
2,Holes do not line up.,"The holes are off by at least 1/2 inch. Without buying more tools or slowly drilling the holes bigger, there is no way to put it on. Very poor workmanship."
3,holes did not line up,"Unfortunately the pre-drilled holes on the hitch did not line up with the threaded holes on my Prius. The pre-drilled holes on the hitch were 1/2"" off. I am going to need to drill the holes on the hitch wider if I want to install the hitch. This is very inconvenient and I want not expecting this. Besides this huge issue, the hitch is nice and came delivered in excellent condition."
2,Toyota Prius 2005,Missing the standard ball hitch in the box. I didn't realized it until I finished installing the tow hitch for hours. It was hard to install because of the holes are off centered and needed a tension bar to spread the ends to align the 4 holes. Good luck! It took 3 1/2 hrs instead of 30 mins. I need to contact amazon to deliver the missing item only. I don't need to return it.

5,one of the best artist biographies i have read,"As a painter, consumed by my own work at times, this book was such a treat. A wonderful and compelling look at one of the most influential artists of my career thus far. so emotional and real."
3,The forgotten daughter of artistic genius,"Interesting to hear about his development and various obsessions, but she gets a little whiny about her own story. Can't blame her -- she's perfectly justified, but still, she isn't that amusing a companion."
5,Treasure trove,"This book has a wealth of information delivered in a clear, straightforward style. The excellent research draws from sources as varied as Gilgamesh and the Ainu bear ritual and manages to bring in all together in a cohesive history. A treasure trove for those interested in folklore of all kinds."
2,Good basic functionality but poor value...,"Each year it gets a little more cluttered with advertising, & licensing garbage. Also, there are too many different products making it difficult to choose the right one each year -- wish they would just sell one product that did the job!! The software also seems a little less helpful each year. The ""Deluxe"" , ""basic"" & ""Premier"" software should be replaced by a single product -- this wasteful marketing (including various mail-in offers, etc.) just makes extra pointless work for all of us. The Premier verion is greatly overpriced and offers little beyond the basic and Deluxe models to justify its existence ... all of the functionality listed for this model should be included in the basic product."
3,Does not include State forms,The instore TurboTax Premier usually includes State forms for the price. This version from Amazon does not. I should haveread the details a little closer.
1,"Horrible set up, small business owners must buy newer QB Pro","The set up has been horrible. I'm running Windows XP. Crashed my computer 3 times now.When I got to downloading from Quickbooks Pro for small business, software told me I must purchase a 2003 or newer QB Pro. Convenient link to purchase for $299. That's ridiculous!So now, if I ever get the software up and running again, I have to either manually enter my business records or spend $299.Don't buy this software if you don't have to."
1,Worthless Junk,"Before i even started to do my tax on Taxcut, i had to import my last year's return from Taxcut. I CANNOT DO IT! The Program keeps giving me an error message. It does not import Taxcut 2003 files! Warning: It fails to import Taxcut 2003 file! I looked around on their online help site, and apparently many users complained to them since last year, and they still havent fixed this problem with the latest update! So if you think you can switch to turbotax from taxcut this year, you are mistaken!For all I care, this program is worthless junk and you can forget about Turbotax from now on."
2,"LANDLORDS, BEWARE!!! BAD SOFTWARE!","I haven't used TurboTax in years. I own several apartment buildings and things got complicated. This year I thought I'd give it a try, but TurboTax Premier wasn't up to the job. In going through EasyStep, there is no way to enter when particular buildings were purchased! That's right - no way to account for depreciation! Unbelievable. I chatted online with their tech support twice, and they couldn't find a way around it.Someone who wasn't paying attention would lose a lot of money by paying a lot of extra taxes.This is incredibly inept on the part of TurboTax. I will never buy anything from Intuit again.In my opinion, the program sucks.P.S. There is a money-back guarantee, but it ain't easy. You have to chat with them online to get the address, and then return the CD ROM via UPS and pray that you get your money back. In my case, they gyped me on the refund by $26. I am taking action against them. Sleazy company."
2,Intuit Customer Support Lacking,"Received TurboTax Premier disc from Amazon. During installation, kept getting different installation errors. Intuit website posted SEVERAL options as work-arounds. Spent too much time trying to fix what ended up being a defective disc. On-line chat w/ Intuit rep was frustrating, at best. Intuit would not ship replacment disc direct since Amazon is not an ""authorized"" seller. Amazon shipped replacement disc (took too many days, Amazon).Response on Intuit's website about TurboTax completely unacceptable. Defective product and not ready for market. Have used TT for 15 years - won't be using it next year."
1,Windows 98 SE Beware!,"I thought using this product to figure my taxes was a breeze! Then I tried to file. I could not e-file and to add insult to injury- the program would not allow me to file by mail!After DAYS of frustation, one rep finally admitted that there was a problem with this product and certain operating systems. I meticulously tried every fix (multiple times) and nothing worked!So... it did a good job of helping me figure my tax, but it will not print in a font acceptable to the IRS.. which pretty much renders this product worthless to me."
4,It works with my Yamaha DGX 640,"The cover just fit my Yamaha DGX640 tightly. Cant be smaller than that.The frabric is a bit short for my keyboard but it's stretchy so,I have to stretch it to the other end. It's a bit difficult for one person to make it stay on one end while to try latch on the other end (two people might be easier) but it works!"
3,Just barely...,"I was looking for a cover for my Yamaha S80, as I was tired of blankets and bath towels to keep dust off the keys. I also have a toddler that is very curious, so covering my keyboard when it wasn't in use was a priority. I wanted something minimal and easy to use. This cover seemed like a good option, but I was concerned since I didn't know if it would fit. Well, it sort of fits. I can get it stretched over the keyboard, but it just barely makes it. It is an improvement over the towel I was using, so I'm giving 3 stars, but I wish it had a little more room. I could see it popping off easily, even if I tighten the cord."
3,Gator Case - Triton Extreme.,"While the item is described as a cover for an 88 key synth, if you have mod or tone controllers to the left of the keyboard, it makes putting the cover on almost impossible as it just keeps popping off the opposite side when placing on the keyboard. All in all it's worth it to cover your keys, but it should have been made bigger to accommodate keys like the Triton Extreme."
1,To small,"This maybe will fit the 76 keys keyboard, but that would be a strectch too. However, for the 88 key of a keyboard, it barely lays across the keys. I do not recommend this case for an 88 keys keyboard."
1,Doesn't say what Keyboards it WILL cover,"I bought this for my Fantom G8. Bad move! It doesn't even come close to fitting. As a matter of fact I cannot see what 88-key keyboard it would. When I put it on and lay it flat there is still an octave and a half of keyboard left to cover. Stretching it still leaves me with a half and octave before the other end slips off. I suppose this helps someone and I like the construction of these covers, but give us a heads up on what keyboards will not fit."
3,Not a great fit,"I just upgraded from a cheap 61-key Casio to a full sized Yamaha P-105 and got this cover to go with it. I always kept a cover on my Casio, I was definitely going to have one for my upgrade. It's disappointing that this doesn't fit like it should. Amazon has the specs listed as 23 x 59.1, but what they don't tell you is that's the fully stretched out size, according to Gator's website. The actual size is... get this... 16 x 48 (as in GKC-1648). Who would have thought the actual size specs would be the product name? That said, it does stay on and fits okay, but it is clearly designed for a keyboard a few inches shorter. The P-105 is 54"" FYI. Gator is using the same product photo for the 61-76 key and the 88 key covers. Based on how my last cover fit, I would bet the picture is of a 61-key with the corresponding cover, as that's close to how my last one fit."
5,Easy on. easy off,"We bought Gator Cases Stretchy Cover Fits 88-Note Keyboard - GKC-1648 for our 88 key Yamaha keyboard. It arrived promptly and in good condition. Gave it to the grandkids, ages 8 and 10 to put on and they had no trouble. It fit perfectly and looked good. We are very happy with this item, because it allows the kids to be independent when they want to use the keyboard, our secondary goal along with keeping the dust off. Thanks for a great product and a very reasonable price"
4,Fits a Kawai ES6,"I was a little worried about getting this cover because of the size concerns other buyers had with their keyboards, but it fits my Kawai ES6 well (granted, with no room to spare). The material seems safe for the instrument and sturdy enough to do its job."
5,As Fred said keeps the kitty litter off the keyboard,I have the Casio WK7500 keyboard and the GKC - 1648 cover fits it very well. It is a very nice cover. I tell you though when you have six cats and they pretty much go where they want to you need to cover everything believe me. It's very well made.
1,Misleading,"Now I uderstand what stretchy means in the product name.I trusted the previous feedback about there were two different sizes, and I should get the correct one. However I was wrong.The 1648 means the size is 16*48, the stretchy mean you can stretch to fit the 88 keyboard.By the way, I have a Kawai MP6, 14*54. It will fit if streth to the maximum size, but obviously, it will not last long that streth too much. I will return it."
1,The size in the description is incorrect.,The product description claims that the size of the cover is 59.1 x 23 inches but when the package arrived the actual size is 48.0 x 16.0 inches.I had purchased this cover to fit my Yamaha DGX-640 that's 59 x 21.8 inches.It's being returned
3,"Koss KEB24 headphones are great value, but ear piece isn't the same as before","These headphones produce a great sound for the price including good bass. The thing I like most about the first pair of these that I purchased is that the rubber ear pieces were so comfortable and soft, I could wear them for 8 hours straight with no ear pain. This is a first for earbuds for me. However, this newest pair I purchased (same model number) have earbuds that are a little harder than the ones before."
3,not as good as expected,"as a music lover,i always looking 4 a good earbuds at not too expensive price.i searched the internet,there are some reviews about koss earbuds.that is why i bought this koss earbuds.after i received this earbuds,i found there is little different from the seller photo in shape.i listened my favored music with this earbuds,the sound effects isnt very good,especially in bass.so i dont recommend this earbuds."
2,"Very good fit, just poor sound","I simply cannot understand any review that describes these ear buds as anything less than fair. They have absolutely no bass, and while the sound is decent spatial highlighting, it just plain tinny.I would have given them one star on sound alone, but they do fit better than most ear buds I have tried.Not recommended."
2,Wish I'd listened to the negative reviews,"These earphones produce an incredibly low amount of bass.I was really shocked that anyone would produce earphones of this sound profile. I had to test it against my other phones to make sure that nothing was wrong with my audio player, computer, headphone jacks, settings, etc. Even a set of free throwaway earphones had much more bass.I'm definitely not a bass head, but I think a minimum amount of bass is necessary for things to sound balanced. While the mids and highs are clear and crisp with these phones, I really cannot bear to use them for more than 5 minutes. It is tolerable for stuff like language learning audio, but seriously disrespects any form of music.As others have mentioned, the cord shape is also weird and lays uncomfortably."
1,not for me,"I was looking for a pair of earphones that might show some improvement over my standard white ipod earphones. I then saw these Koss keb24 earphones reviewed (among others) in the Circuits page of the NYT.After opening my order and trying them out, I found them sounding actually worse than the stock ipod ones. The optional tips did provide for a better fit, but I'm not interested in anything with a poorer sound.I got a return shipping number, and shipped them back for a refund."
1,Pretty Lame,"Joo Carlos Martins has been an interesting pianist over the years. He recorded much Bach perhaps forty years ago (since reissued) and it was worth some attention although quite individualistic and a good bit out of the mainstream. This disc is newer and shows Martins's technique to have diminished considerably. There is, frankly, nothing here that hasn't been recorded better by others. Probably the best thing here is the familiar short Scriabin Nocturne, Op. 9, No. 2. The Saint-Sans études, however, are awkwardly cautious. The Bach/Brahms Chaconne has some expressive depth but has been better done by such pianists as Leon Fleisher.The Ravel D Major Concerto is simply a throw-away. Accompanied by Boris Spassov leading the Bulgarian National Symphony, this performance is really dreadful. The orchestra is bush-league and Martins's playing includes bunches of wrong notes.Avoid this one.Scott Morrison"
1,Did not SUCK! It sucks,"This machine is ""worthless"". The previous viewer said it picked up an occasional dust bunny. That is about all it will pickup. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VACUUM! I did not take heed to the viewer who gave it such a negative review, wish I had. This machine is WORTHLESS! Giving this item a ""1"" star was generous it did not deserve that."
1,Pray you don't get one that doesn't work!,"We received one that didn't work out of the box. We contacted the seller, Electronica Direct, and their responce was, ""Dear Valued Customer, Our company policy is that we do not pay for return shipping, even on defective products. I apologize that this does cause you inconvenience but that is our policy across the board. Thank you for choosing Electronica Direct! Michelle Customer Support"" It cost us $20 to return the item even though we never got to use it!! What a rip."
4,A solid performer but takes some practice and study.,This is a nice unit. I especially like the large screen size and the 20 gig hard drive. I have down-loaded many albums onto the 10 gigs set aside for mp3 music and use this feature constantly on trips. Using the gps requires some investment in time studying the manual and experimenting with the different trip options that are available until it becomes second nature. The unit comes with user friendly and efficient mounting hardware. On hot sunny days it is sometimes necessary to turn on the A/C and set it to blow through the defroster vents to cool the unit. This is no problem though since the unit will tell you when it is getting too hot. I have no regrets about buying Lowrance.
1,not a good unit,"Our unit died just before the warranty was up, I sent it back ($50 because of weight and insurance). They sent me a refurbished one, didn't work. I sent it back (on their dime). They sent me another refurbished one; it stopped working after two hours. I sent it back; they sent me a new 600C. This one works for now, but I don't expect it to last the full year. I thought Lowrance made quality products, but after this experience, I believe there quality has suffered a devastating blow. I would not recommend there products anymore."
4,I am impressed with the Lowrance iway 500C GPS,It works as advertised. It takes a little while to fine tune it to get the right mix bettwen interstate and local roads. It will sometimes tell you to make a left or a right incorrectly. Another intesting thing to note is that it will sometime miss turns or fail to tell you to be in a particular lane and other times it warns about what lane you should be in. I would recommend this product.
2,"Lot of features, no use","I have this unit for 1 year now. Greatest problems. (BTW, I have latest software 1.7.0)1. Unit heats up in just 30 minutes. Just in 30 minutes of navigation, the unit showed this message ""Please cool the unit or the unit will shutdown"". Imagine you are in New York city . and the unit shows this message. I had such multiple instances. I had magallen before which had 20gb harddisk, which is lighter and does not have a heat sink nor has heat problems.2. Unit recognizes that you are OffRoute but takes long time to regenerate the way.3. The directions are always ""beating around the bush"" rather than shortest distance.4. On entering addresses, it says the road not in database, but when you are driving on the same road, the unit shows the name of the same road on the top of screen"
2,Trouble Prone,"Had it 2 weeks used it 6 times and had to send it back. I had a noise coming through the speaker that drowned out the navigator's voice. It almost sounded like a motorcycle.When it worked, I absolutely loved it. The directions were clear and concise and being told to turn at the street's name is nice too. It aquired its signal in less than 30 seconds everytime. Learning the interface was a breeze too.However, it is very heavy. And putting it on and taking it off of the Ram windshield's suction cup was very tedious. I expected the heaviness but I did not expect the difficulty of the suction cup placement and removal.So, I returned it and I am getting ready to purchase a Nav One 2750 or a Magellan 800. Can't decide on which one yet, though."
1,Don't buy it,"Don't buy this unit. The database is terrible, and Lowrance wants $75 for an update. This unit has sent me on wild goose chases looking for stores that moved from the database's given address years ago. It has no listing for businesses that have existed for years, and more often than not tells you to turn after you already passed the street it wanted you to turn on. Extremely disappointing, and definitely not worth the money."
2,SUCKS,"I hate this GPS. It got me lost in the boonies more than once, it takes forever to get satellite signal, maps are extremely hard to read while driving, having to use the stylus is really inconvenient. My suggestion is get a more user-friendly GPS that you can easily navigate at red-lights or short stops. I have a Mio c310 it was really cheap and easy to use...literally take it out of the box and get going. This thing is something else."
5,Lowrance iway 500 C,"I just returned from a 4,000-mile road trip and had the opportunity to give the Lowrance iway 500 C a good work out. I was pleasantly surprised to find the 500 C functioned flawlessly. Like all GPS units, it occasionally did not select the route that I wanted, however after driving a short distance it reprogrammed to the correct route. Finding POI's is somewhat awkward, but this may be due to operator error. I especially liked the large screen and the interface. Being able to switch between two screens with different scales was a nice feature. The night mode in 3d is remarkable. Great GPS for the money and highly recommend it."
2,Too complicated and heavy,"I've tried the Garmin C330 and the Tom Tom Go 700, the Lowrance iWay 500 was much heavier than the others and too complicated to operate. I now own a Garmin C340 which I like very much, so does my husband!"
2,Screen not bright first 15 minutes,"I bought the Lowrance iway 500c. Worked great in the house. Next morning, screen was too dark to read for 15 minutes, then display became normally bright. Did this every morning for 4 days. Lowrance replaced the unit, but the new one did exactly the same thing. Called Lowrance, who said they're having a problem with this they should fix by ""this spring"". I returned the unit for refund.Lowrance suggested I keep it in the house overnight. Who wants to detach the unit at night and re-attach it in the morning? (If you don't forget.)If you're in a warm climate, can sit and wait 15 minutes on cold mornings for it to work or get one that doesn't have this problem, it's great. I consider this to be a major design flaw.I bought a Garmin 2610 to replace it and love the functionality, although I'd love a little bit larger screen."
3,"Great device, but heavy (beware)","No complaints about how the device works so far, I've managed to find some new routes in the metro NY area by blindly following the directions (the voice directions, turn previews, and MP3 player are nice, though it should have USB 2.0 at this point, the technology is a few years old at this point. Loading MP3 takes forever).I do have one real problem though regarding mounting the device in my car. I used the suction cup mount and after a week or so of being installed I developed a crack from the suction cup mount to the top of my windshield from the vibrations!! $250 later to replace the windshield and I've got a nice GPS unit that I can't use in my car...yet. Granted, I have a MINI Cooper S that is pretty tightly sprung, but come-on, this shouldn't happen!Maybe in a big SUV with a marshmallow suspension you won't have this problem. Best of luck."
2,U LIKE IT. U BUY IT.,POOR CUST. SUPPORT. TAKE AT LEAST 5MINS TO LOAD THE PROGRAM COMPLETE. THE PRODUCT IS HEAVY.
2,"So far, not so good","The unit has a nice bright screen and is easy to use. I have had it for a little over a month, but it has spent more time back at Lowrance than with me. There seem to be some major problems with the 500c that I was unaware of before buying. I know their marine units are highly regarded, so I thought Lowrance was a good bet. The hard drive packed up this time, and I am waiting for a new unit replacement. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't choose Lowrance again. Be prepared for a loooooong wait if you call customer service!"
5,Better than Spiderman!,"Some complaints I've heard about this film, and my responses: 1/ Eric Bana is stone faced and unemotional (He's playing an emotionally repressed scientist, not Jim Carrey!). 2/ The origin of his powers takes up to much screen time (Why don't you try catching a lethal burst of Gamma rays in the face and see what super powers you gain!) 3/ The story goes to deep into Banner's mind (Let's see; the character of Banner transforms due to extreme anger. I don't know about you, but I can't remember the last time I flew into a blind rage, but then I didn't have a traumatized childhood). Face it! This is a great movie, and if you didn't like its thought provoking story, then there's always the mindless Charlie's Angels 2 (But then that's bombed too... Hey, what the heck kind of movie do you guys want?!)"
1,Cure for insomnia,"I was really looking forward to this movie. I love the Hulk and after the success of X-Men and Spiderman (two excellent comic book movies) I was begining to think Marvel wouldn't let them put out a bad movie. Well, they did. It drags, the plot is incoherent, it just plain sucks. It may be the perfect cure for insomnia..."
1,Just as BAD as everyone says it is.,"This movie is just as bad as everyone says it is. It tries way too hard to be a ""comic book"" movie and ends up being very annoying. Forget the review which says that it was filmed for the short attention span movie goer, this movie was filmed by people who smoked pot and then said let's make a movie! Tried too hard to cover way too much ground and come up with a way out back story. This is the HULK we are talking about not some piece of classic literature. Ang Lee embarassed himself with this one, so did Marvel. Don't even bother with this movie, watch The Incredible Hulk instead."
4,Not bad at all.,"Bruce Banner (Eric Bana)is a genetic scientist who, while trying to save a friend, puts himself infront of a radiation explosion. While recovering in the hospital, he realizes that he's not in pain and feels much better than he ever did. The downside to the accident is that it gives him the power to turn into a bulging green giant whenever his angry feelings no longer remain supressed. For someone not knowing anything about the Hulk, I was quite surprised to find myself enjoying this movie. The only bad thing I have to say about this film with the CGI in this film. It was awful."
2,This movie is a mess.,"This movie is just awful. The bleakness of the story line is only slightly worse than the emptiness and vapidity of the acting. The love story between Banner and his girl-friend (Connelly) lacks any warmth or interest. And what should have been a powerful relationship between Banner and his father ends up ragged, confused, and senseless.For those old enough to have enjoyed either the Stan Lee comics or the TV show, ignore this movie. It is but a poor reflection of a creative and engaging sotry. This weak rendition will leave you empty and disappointed."
1,Sad,"It's very sad how Ang Lee made a mess of the 'Hulk' movie. This could have been a great movie: action-packed and funny like Spiderman with great special effects - but no, they had to give it to the director of 'Crouching Tiger - Hidden Dragon'. I figure it is because the hulk jumps around a lot just like the actors in the 'crouching tiger' movie? They should try to fix it by making a movie called 'The REAL Hulk' and give it to a director who knows how to make action movies. The actors are a joke, the dialogue is boring and predictable. The split-screen technology is crap."
3,A teaser!,"I went into this movie hearing bad things and then not expecting much, but, i was actually enjoying it. The action was good and there was some humore in parts and I liekd the storyline.....that was until it got near the end.. i dunno what the heck happen but it was like a joke the movie just totally went downhill and all this crazy stuff started happening. I give the first 70% of the movie 4 stars and the last 2. It was a dissapointment."
4,A surprisingly good movie,Not my normal type of movie but I have to say I enjoyed it. Special effects were really good. Story was a little to typical and expected but all in all I really liked the movie.
2,Expected More,This was horrible. I was very disappointed and so was my son. I would say that I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
3,Starts slow but get better towards the end,"As someone who did not read the comics or watch the TV version of the show, I was disappointed at the graphics as well as direction and ligthing in the moive. Most of the scenes are shot in dark environment and makes it difficult to watch on TV. Second half of the movie was a little better. Overall not as great as it could have been..."
3,not nearly as bad as it was made out to be...,"i passed on watching this in the theater because i thought the cgi looked cheesy. but after watching it on dvd i realized that the cgi wasn't the problem at all (it had to be cgi, with the hulk jumping around for miles), but rather some weird plot involving weirdo nick nolte as banner's father who actually injected bruce making him the hulk and the gamma rays just set it off. whatever. but otherwise the hulk movie was better than i thought it would be."
3,Not so incredible,"Being a big fan of the comic I was really disappointed by this big screen version. Sure it tells the story well of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk but lacked any sense of action or adventure. Way too long, it seemed to take forever for the transformation to take place and was very slow and boring in some parts. Maybe I expected too much from the film, but it is still an okay movie. I was a lttle surprised by the casting of Eric Bana as the Hulk, as much as a fan of his that I am of his having followed his career from 'full frontal' and 'the castle, I don't think he was the best option. A good reason to purchase this movie is for the special features."
1,this stinks!!!!,what is with the 5 stars? it does NOT deserve it!!!! this is worse than watching power rangers lost galaxy!!
3,"Could've been somewhat worse, but also could've been a lot better!","I for one am a huge Hulk fan. I love the comics, and pretty soon will love the video game. Hulk, in fact, is my 5th favorite comic book character topped only by Punisher, Wolverine, Spider-Man, and Tigra. I thought I would love this film. Unfortunatelty, most of it was just chit chat. However, the fight scenes and the way Hulk smashed and the final fight with the evil father were wonderful. Also, I thought Betty Ross was cute. Put these facts together, and this film averages out big time. It wasn't the worst, but it is way under my top movies. If you like comic book movies, watch Spider-Man, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Batman, Elektra, Daredevil, Blade, and Superman. Only watch this if you've seen all of those and /or if you have nothing better to do because everything else sucks. What I am trying to tell you is that this movie is OK. Only OK. And that is all. End of story."
1,Shrek Meets Out of Africa,"What a boring movie! After sitting through tedious dialogue and tortured expressions while Bruce Banner makes his way through repressed memories and failed relationships, he gets mad and turns into Shrek."
5,Best Movie Marvel Has Released,"This movie was great. The special effects were the best I've ever seen. The actors did great jobs and the scenes were the Hulk jumps are great. Another cool thing about this film is that Bruce's father turns into the Absorbing Man. I'm not going to say how, but needless to say that is only one of the cool stuff in this movie. This movie is a little darker than the other Marvel movies, but don't think that means it's bad. In fact I think it really enhances the movie. If you're a Marvel fan you have to see this. If you're not go check out anyway. It's awesome."
5,Awesome deal,Condition was perfect...exactly what I was looking for...transition super fast...thank you much! We had a Hulk themed birthday party and dvd was playing in the background...so thanks again!
1,Highly Dissapointing,"This movie was not all that wonderfull, it is about five billion times woorse than the previews amke it out to be, and also the plot takes einstein to understand-for example, what was up with the Hulk's dad (toward the end of the movie) turning into a giant bubble and then blowing up, and also why did the hulk's girlfriend's dad try to kill him with the weird giant dogs? those are only two of the many very difficult to understand parts of this lame movie. I saw Spiderman and X-Men 2 and other Marvel movies, and those were pretty good, but this one is a discrace to the marvel name, so all of the people that were going to buy this twisted movie, you might want to think twice before you buy, get any other movie by marvel and i assure you that it will be better than the Discracefull ""Hulk"""
2,"Anti Climatic. Boring, Not worth the money",Boring boring boring movie.Some half way decent special effects
2,This movie DRAAAAAAAGGGEEED,"This movie would have been good, but it drug out so long, I got bored. I would have left, but I didn't, because I hoped it would get better. It didn't. There is very little action in it, and what action the movie has consists solely of the Hulk getting mad, breaking stuff, and then growing bigger. That's about it. Don't go see this movie, it's a waste of time and money."
3,Not As Bad As People Say,"I thought the cast for this film was really good. I also liked how the director shot certain parts of the movie as if you were reading a comic book. Despite the positive elements, there were two main things that dragged it down. They were the wierd-looking super dogs, and the disappointing water creature that the father becomes at the end. The special effects were also lacking throughout. This one is decent, but the newer Hulk movie is far superior."
2,Great Movie/Blu-ray Difficulties,"I absolutely love this movie, BUT, unfortunately, I think I've received a bad batch of Blu-ray discs from Amazon. After three minutes of waiting for the movie to load, the first one would cause the Sony Blu-ray player to automatically reboot once the movie starts, no matter if it started from the beginning or at a random chapter. It wouldn't happen when I would play the Extras, only the movie. I asked for and received within 48 hours a replacement Blu-ray disc and encountered the same exact problem. And I know it's not the player, because I played other Blu-ray discs with no problems. Hopefully, I'll get to see it on Blu-ray soon because from what I saw on the opening menu, the movie looked great."
3,Ok,"It was good but not funny, unlike spiderman and daredevil. so when you look at a newspaper rating, believe it. it's true!"
4,"""Hulk"" is a smashing good time","""The Hulk"" is one of the best super hero films ever. Ang Lee has created a brilliant, creative, beautiful film with the help of an incredible cast and crew who deliver on every level. The story and characters are both well written and interesting. The entire cast does a great job, especially Eric Bana and Nick Nolte. A well done film and definitely well worth seeing."
2,Ah no....,"I'm not a comic book reader but I do like comic book based movies, seen Spiderman, both X-men movies and so on. Frankly I thought this movie [was bad]...some scenes seemed to go on forever. I went with 6 other people and we all were either very disappointed by it or thought it was just ok and one guy is a huge Hulk freak. And I?m sorry I?m not a comic aficionado so I was little confused on aspects of the plot and there seemed to be big gaps in the story and how we got from point A to point B. I even closed my eyes & took a little snooze in some parts because it was BORING. Not the best movie I have seen... more hype than anything else. I would just wait until it comes out on video."
3,"Flawed, but watchable","Having just came from watching the Hulk, I have the following observations. The movie is entertaining, but it could have been better. The main problems with the movie include, a very slow start (it takes forever for the action to kick in), and some poorly done computer affects. There were times when I felt like I was watching a video game and not a movie. And I guess that Ang Lee wanted this to be a feel good tragedy, because everytime the Hulk destroys a helicopter or tank, the crews radio in to headquaters that they are allright. Hmmmm....I seriously doubt that a tank crew would be allright after having been tossed for about a mile. Also, the big climax between father and son was so dark you couldn't real see what was happening. This movie is at its best when the Hulk is onscreen, although all of the actors did a good job with the material. Not nearly as good as Spiderman, but not bad."
1,"Should have been called ""DUD""","Ang Lee viewed the story as a Greek Tragedy. The only tragedy here was letting him direct this ponderous, dull, flat meandering film. The multi-frame scenes that are supposed to mimic a comic page only distract. I mean how many frames of helicopters flying endlessly over featureless desert are needed?The story starts out with a confusing obtuse story about the hero's father doing some sort of proscribed experiment. Unfortunately the rest of the film adds nothing to the plot. The characters are all either flat and stereotypic, or silly caricatures. You never get a chance to develop any sympathy for anyone in the film.And just so it does not go unmentioned: four star generals DO NOTcommand bases; secret or otherwise."
1,dumb,"this movie made no sense, I am a huge fan of the comic, and this movie to me just seems like a big advertising ploy.And the cgi isn't very good, the hulk looks incredibley fake. I don't understand how the people who do the cgi could think that the hulk looked even remotely realistic. He looks like a big slab of clay."
1,THE ABSOLUTE WORST MOVIE OF 2003!,"This movie was absolutely horrible. It was like Daredevil, where they didn't know what to do with the movie, but a lot worse. The script was all around the place and the special effects were as good as nothing. They should have waited a couple of years so that the special effects could have been more realistics. The Hulk looked like they had drawn a picture of him and put it in the movie. I know this is suppost to be a comic book movie, but they should have tried to make him more realistic. If you really wanted to go see a great comic book movie just go see Spider-man or X-Men..."
4,Comic Book Movie done right,"I have read so many reviews from people that after watching this film ""don't get it"". This film builds and builds to a high ending that doesn't let go.I was gripping the seat watching this film I applaud Ang Lee for pushing the envelope on this film he uses many different camera angels and techniques when it all said and done.Good preformances all around from Bana and Connelly. DVD exras are very nice. Worth getting. 3 million DVD's were sold of the title the first week.....thats a very large amount if it wasn't liked.With Marvel recently announcing a sequal I am sure that Connelly and Bana are going to pass on this next film of the HULK franchise. The film made 130+ million at the box office but was considered a dissapointment."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,If you have seen the past Hulks you know that this one compared to the others just sucked. It was a terrible movie and is one of the only ones I am not going to buy.Would definitely not reccommend this movie to anyone unless you haven't seen the past shows and movies.
2,Two Stars because it takes involuntary vomiting to qualify for One Star,"The casting was terrible, the script horrible, the effects sub par and all wrapped up in a screen play that was better used as a bird cage liner.Giant poodles? That was their idea of thrills and chills? Did anyone in post production actually WATCH this mess before they unleashed it on the public? Exactly what color were they seeing when they viewed the Hulk on screen the first time.This movie went nowhere in the theatres and did even worse as a rental.Watch and then buy the Edward Norton version. Forget that this version even exists. The studio has."
1,"boring,boring,BORING!!!!!!!!!",this is such a STUPID movie!!!!!! they try to be serious then..something else. why couldn't it just be hulk breaking everything and he goes back to normal at the end? fantastic four is such a better movie than this junk especially the bad guy he was a stupid choice should have done something else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i'm not wacthing this EVER again!!! it's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo STUPID!!!!!!!! fantastic four doesn't try to be serious and it is good.
2,It took an hour before the movie even made sense.,"I was one of the many who saw the Hulk opening day, and I was dissapointed. I will admit I never liked the TV show, but this version did seem more like the comic book I knew. I thought Ang Lee would do a fantastic job, but in the end I was let down.It took way to long for the Hulk to show himself. I was constantly looking at my watch wondering what I was watching, because it didn't seem like a hulk movie. The problem was that Ang Lee tried too hard to explain this 15 foot muscular green giant. When in the end, how can you explain it?Don't get me wrong, when the hulk was on the screen, I loved it. To see this guy jumping miles into the air bouncing around like Shrek on steroids was fun. The desert chase was superb. But overall the movie drowned in its own scientific garbage that doesn't make any sense to the casual viewer. Go see it if you are a hulk fan, otherwise, you might want to reconsider."
2,the hulk,"I recieved the movie this morning,but to my disappointment all i got was the movie!! i know i got the movie at a great price,but in all the orders i have gotten from amazon i have never one that had just the movie,if the people would tell us this upfront i would then know! very poor communicationand i will not order any more from this seller!!!"
2,HULK SMASH!!!!!!!!!!!! MAYBE NOT.,This movie sucks . there's 99.9% of talking and drama but a whooping 2 min of action. before the movie came out i watched the preveiw a 100 times seeing him spin the tank and throwing it miles away. another thing i hated about this movie was the comic panels which got very anoying. in all this movie sucks and i only gave it two stars for the action scenes.P.S ANG LEE SUCKS AT DIRECTING!!!!
2,way too long in the beginning,"Most of this movie is spent introducing the charcters and leading up to the gamma accident that changes him to the HULK. When he does change things really pick up and the movie has interest but, alas this is few and far between. Bruce Banner was a whiney little man all wrapped up in strange thoughts and memories. he aslo treats the beautiful Betty like a dog in the beginnning instead of realizing she loved him so much. but worst of all was the way over the top over acting by nick nolte as Banners daddy. he looked and acted like the mess he was in this overblown far-reaching bust of a movie."
5,saw it twice!,"I have seen Hulk twice because it was one of those movies that have alot of pieces to put together. It had alot more depth and was much more like the comic then the cheesy Bill Bixby series.Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly do a great job as Bruce and Betty. I can't believe people are complaining about the Hulks Graphics, I thought he looked fairly realistic considering how huge he is. I like Ang Lees multi screen effect, you really get to see each characters emotions at the same time."
4,A good movie.,"No this is nothing like the TV series. But this is a very good movie.It did take too long to get to see the Hulk, but once you did, it was pretty incredible. I didn't like the jumping thing the Hulk did throughout the movie, but aside from that, I thought it captured the comic book side pretty good (though he doesn't speak excpet for one little line).The extra DVD has some pretty incredible stuff and even gives you the dimensions of the Hulk based on his anger level.Overall, this was a pretty good movie and once the movie got rolling, it didn't really slow down (the dog fight scene was very cool)."
2,This movie needs some improvement,"I been waiting for this new Hulk movie to come out when I first heard that it was going into production.I was wondering all this time thinking, who was going to get the acting part for the Hulk character. Would it be some new up and coming actor that is a bodybuilder or would it be Lou Ferrigno?I was disapointed to find out that the Hulk was nothing more than a computer animated figure. If Ben Aflek could play Dare Devil and Toby Miguire could play Spiderman and Micheal Keaton could play Batman, why couldn't Ang Lee get an actor/bodybuilder to play the Hulk?Bruce Bana played the Bruce (David) Banner character OK, but I think Hugh Jackman has more of the Bruce (David) Banner look and could play the charater much better.If Ang Lee makes another Hulk movie lets hope there is some kind of improvement to the Hulk character."
3,Could be so much better!,"I respect director Ang Lee a lot and looked forward to see what he would do with ""Incredible Hulk"". Unfortunately, the movie was quite disappointing. First of all, it's too long - there is no just enough action for so much time. And all other potential movie qualities notwithstanding THIS movie is about action. The editing, although could be considered unusual and avangard by some people, reminded me cheap TV movies (this does not relate to special effects though which were quite good). I am not saying that it's a bad movie but I did want to fastforward it a few times. It's really too bad. Acting was good but Nick Nolte is exceptional."
1,Stay Away Stay Far Away,Ok let me start off by saying this film could have been ok but they tried to give the skull bashing hulk of the comics a bunch of human feelings that make the story very slow moving and at times yes VERY BORING even the action sequences suffer from bad direction. This Movie is almost as bad as crouching tiger hidden dragon which is my all time least favorite movie I dont know what anyone saw in that movie in the theater some people were so bored they started laughing at every bad sequence.
4,"""Hulk""","It has its moments and it can be flashy fun at times and very serious at others. But the movie is really a set up for hopefully ""Hulk 2"". I say every comic book movie sould have at least two films. The 1st is the set up and the 2nd is all the fun you can have with the charecters, for example, ""X-Men"" and ""X2"", ""Spider-Man"" and ""Spider-Man 2"" ect. I hope there will be a ""Hulk 2"" because people can have more respect for ""Hulk"". Overall a decent film with amazing effects and some boring parts. Give it a try.Grade: B-"
3,Slow start but entertaining.,"I saw the movie last night. The beginning was painfully slow. The story had substance and the effects were great until Hulk started jumping / flying through the sky. At that point, the artists forgot that helicopters and jets couldn't travel cross the states, stop, and find the hidden target in seconds. Hulk also looked oddly out of scale within the landscape. I especially enjoyed the father's special power; effects were very well done. The movie is worth a matinee or a rental."
3,GREEN AND MEAN (money and greedy),"Yeah The Hulk is one mean green oversized Shrek, but he is also mean and greedy(green) for fooling a bunch fans into watching this movie. Before you go ignoring most negative reviews on this one, take my advice and rent this one first, and then decide for yourself if you like it or dislike it. It is one of those that you've got to see to believe. My review is in the middle. I thought for sure that I would know once I watched it, but even after watching it, I just don't know. I liked half here and there and did not like half there and over there. That's why you can't take anyone else's word, except you own. See it at your own risk. I know The Hulk would probably be so mad at me for saying this, but he'd blow up into a big pile of green slobbing ooze if he let this review get to him too much."
3,Made by people who don't know the comic book,"This movie was just OK. Not great, just OK.It spends over 40 minutes setting the story upwhen a quick 5 to 10 minute epilogue would havedone the same thing. I mean, come on, is the originmore important or the action. This movie was 30% action,80% setup. Should've been the other way around.Also, the movie did not stay true to the comic bookand even reinvented the origin. I know comic puristsare disgusted, rightfully so. For a great comicmovie check out Daredevil instead. This movie didn'tsuck, but was just ok. This is a shame consideringthe source material."
2,Don't bother!,The Hulk series years ago was great but this movie isn't. The scenes are drawn out and dialogue poor. The creation of the Hulk character is amazing but there is too much violence once the action starts. I was disappointed and bored.
4,Hulk- Bana- Movie.,"Eric Bana in The Hulk was pretty good, Of course the cgi and some details were cheesy, I think it was a Good Hulk movie, of course compared to Edward Norton in The Newer Hulk. See this and the Newer Hulk. I prefer the Newer Hulk Movie."
1,Bad Science,"OK - no one expects the Hulk to make sense. The existance of the creature violates nearly every law of conservation of energy and matter. You either accept and enjoy the story, or you gripe about it, mumbling ""That's impossible"" every ten seconds...STILL - why do Hollywood writers have to grab every new scientific concept or breakthrough and act like it explains everything and justifies bad science? The new buzzword is 'NANOTECHNOLOGY' so now Bruce Banner gets big thanks to NANOMEDS (oh and Gamma Radiation, too, just to satisfy the pureists)Bottom Line - this is a Bad Movie, and the CGI Hulk is almost as bad as the CGI Rock in 'The Mummy Returns'On a positive note though, Eric Bana is very good looking, and at certain angles looks like a young Christopher Reeve. Hello Warner Brothers - we've found the new Superman..."
1,Just Didn't Get It,"Perhaps I was distracted the night I watched the movie. Perhaps it was all of the pseudo-scientific jargon. Perhaps it was the cheesy ""comic book frame"" technique that Ang Lee seemed to use ad nauseum throughout the film. Whatever it was, the film did not resonate with me at all the way I thought it would.Eric Bana displays the range of a turnip as Bruce Banner. He has a total of three expressions throughout the film: vacant, morose, and angry, and tends to remain in the first through most of the film. I grew up watching Bill Bixby ""hulk out"" into Lou Ferrigno, and for all the cheesiness of the series, I'd take it any day over this overblown piece of cinematic fluff.This film is painfully slow and pathetically written. If you haven't seen it already, save your money for the X-Men or Spiderman franchises--they know how to do comic book action properly."
1,... skip it.,"I grew up a fan of the Hulk, so I couldn't wait to see the new movie. Imagine my surprise when I saw that they had mangled the story of the Hulk, turning him from an accidental anti-hero into the posterboy for male-bashing.In this story, Bruce Banner's father is a violent man, with his emotions out of control - his angelic wife loves him but is unable to penetrate through and share her natural female stability with him. Bruce himself is an emotional basketcase, all [messed] up by his father. Then, due to an accident, Bruce is turned into a violent man with his emotions out of control - his angelic girlfriend loves him but is unable to penetrate through and share her natural female stability with him. Do I see a pattern here?Sorry, but whoever redesigned the story of the Hulk is a misandrist - probably a man filled with self-loathing...."
4,3.5 stars,"Ehhh... Not what I expected, and not as fun as Spider-man, but kicks Daredevil's butt! The director was dumb though. You'll understand when you see it. Die-hard Hulk fans should appreciate this. People that didn't like it thought it'd be another mindless action all the way movie. But this is more focused on characters then on action. There's action in it, but not to the extent people thought."
3,Watch it if you are a Hulk fan.,"I am a Hulk fan and after seeing the teaser for the film a summer before it was released I could not wait to see it. I was a little disapointed. I was worried about the visual effects, how would the Hulk look. The Hulk looked incredible, as good as Golum. The story was not so good. Not enough action. Hardly any major emotions-laughter, fear, excitement-did I feel during the movie. I felt even his tranformation from Banner to the Hulk was understated. The problem may be that there are fans of the comic book and fans of the tv series. They should have tried to emulate one or the other. The movie had too much about Banners early life and not enough HULK SMASH!!! Maybe they had to show Banners early history so people who are new to the Hulk could understand what was going on but the movie suffered as a result. In closing I will say that the Hulk looked as real as possible. Great job in that department."
2,"I really, really wanted to like this movie!","I saw this in the theater not on DVD, nor do I plan to watch the DVD. I enjoyed the Hulk-smash bits, who wouldn't? I also liked how they used cutting to give it the feel of being in a graphic novel, but otherwise it was pretty much a snoozer. It tried to be psychologically interesting but failed. I like the Hulk and really wanted to like this movie, but I was bored. And the one scene where you were actually interested in what happens, the final fight. You couldn't see it because of poor lighting and poor animation. I'm still not sure how this movie ended, and sadly I don't really care. Maybe they will add in more scenes and make this movie more interesting, but I'm not sure that's possible."
1,Not good,"This movie was the worst marvel movie made so far. The first 20 minutes of the movie were when Bruce was a child. Ang Lee got to much into the backround of Bruce's character.There were only three fights in the whole movie!!!! The worst thing about it was that 2 of the fights were bad and so was the CGI. People didn't go to the movie to watch the Hulk's past,they went to see Hulk smash and destroy things and fight the army."
4,Hulk,"Although this film may appear to Hulk fans as a diss-of-a-film sort of movie, ""Hulk"" is actually very good if you're not constantly comparing it to the original comics and the television shows. I saw Jennifer Connely as one of the better people starring in this film, and Nick Nolte was hysterical as the overdriven father. I thought the split screen was sometimes annoying, but at times (such as the electricution of Bruce), it was very interesting and useful. Overall, I'd say that Hulk is worthy of a 4.5 star rating because of some very minor flaws, but I just think its good and I actually liked it better than Spiderman..."
2,Wish Director Hadn't Ruined Good Opportunity,"Ang Lee really gave me ANGst. The first half is horrible, lots of Islam-sounding music and brooding of Banner and a story that barely moves. VERY difficult to sit through this. Once the Hulk goes on a rampage, it certainly gets better but the CGI is OK-to-Good and not superb as we expect in today's world.It's too bad they got Ang Lee as he almost ruined Stan Lee's creation.I wish a Marvel character had been respected better by a director. Hulk and Marvel fans MUST own this just because, but it won't be your favorite. Even the mediocre (given today's expectations we all have) TV series with Bill Bixby (who was wonderful as Banner) has FAR more heart and soul than much of the first half of this one."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE SUCKS!IT`S SO CRAZY,STUPID,BULLCRAP,AND ALL THAT KIND OF BAD STUFF!I DON`T RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE FOR ANYONE!IT DOSENT EVEN MAKE ANY SENCE!"
1,i don't think it even desverses a title!,"""If i die before i'll wake!, at least in heaven this film won't be there!, i can, moan at the derictor, and shout at the cast!. This film is really rubbish, and i can't wait till they ban it!, Oh no i can't wait!""don't watch it!"
1,The Sulk,"This movie proves that not all superhero movies are good movies. Other superhero movies usually something in common with the comic book they were in. The Hulk does not do this. Bruce Banner isn't the Hulk because his father did weird stuff to his mother. And CGI Hulk was questionable. They just couldn't make a suit that looked a hundred times better than CGI (see ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" ).This is perhaps the worst superhero movie of all time."
1,Terrible,"Another been there done that movie, i really didnt understand what the point of the movie was. I want my money back. Gets 1 star for having very good visual effects!"
1,SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First, worse superhero movie since Power Rangers The Movie. Second thing is the movie made me very nausius becasue they were contsatly splitting the screens in more then three views at a time. Third, They made a mivie made for kids WAY over dramatic. Fourth, In SPider-man after 10 mins Peter is already turning into spiderma. In Hulk it took like 45 mins for bruce just to get exposed to radiation. Fifth, HUlk looked WAY to cartoony. Sixth, There was not enough hulk smash. And finally, I couldn't wait to leave the theater. HUlk was disapointment."
1,IS THIS A JOKE?!,"What a complete piece of crap. This movie is just one big mess. I'll stick with watching the original tv show (w/ Bill Bixby) and reading my old comics. Don't waste your time or money on this dredge. If you like comic books made into movies stick with X-Men and Spiderman, hell even Daredevil was ten times better than this train wreck. Oh well you get my point. Don't watch this movie!"
4,Mean and Green,"This movie was a movie that I was very excited to see and I was not disappointed. The beginning of the movie moved a little too slow for me, but it wasen't worthless dialouge. This movie does a good job of showing how troubled Bruce Banner really is. Eric Bana does a great job as Bruce Banner. He really does a good job of portraying him the way that he was in the comics. Jennifer Connelly plays an almost too serious Betty Ross. For those who say that the Hulk looks too fake, you need to get your eyes checked because these special effects are amongst the best I've seen. I doubt that there will be a sequel, although I would like to see one or two. A little too long, maybe needed some humor and Nick Nolte's character was annoying. Otherwise a great movie."
4,Definitely PG-13. Don't slack on the ages allowed to view.,"The movie is incredible! The special effects fantastic. The story line a bit sluggish to start but you get past that. The comic-book style is very different but effective and fun.PARENTS - definitely pay attention to the rating and don't slack on this one. It is PG-13. Don't hedge and let the younger kids watch it - or if you do - expect some nightmares. Scenes of child abandonment from a 2-year-old's perspective, animal lab testing that gets graphic, parents fighting violently behind a closed door from a 5-year-old's perspective and then just the general anger management the good doctor experiences by letting it all out in green.My husband loved it! I liked it. With all the marketing of Hulk kids toys, it seems to set this up as something it is not.Adults and *older* teens ENJOY! The little guys need to go to bed before you hit play on this one."
2,Needed action,"When I heard they were going to make a film about the Hulk I got excited cause I thought it was going to be one hell of a thrill ride. Boy was I wrong, the graphics were good but there wasn't enough action. If you are going to make a film about the hulk you gotta make sure there is enough action and less talk. That's why I liked the comics, because they were quick and had a lot of action. This film was like an independent film with a great big monster on it. Ang Lee may be a talented director but he should stick to films like crouching tiger hidden dragon , and he should stay away from comic book movies in the future."
4,Woooooooow,"This is a mindblower.... some external reviwers have panned that the Hulk got a serious treatment, but to my mind - it`s all for the better:-))) The only letdown is that I do miss TV`s Lou Ferrigno in the titlerole(although he is a trifle old to have played the role, though he DOES make a walk-on in the film as a securuty-guard early on in the film)..The Hulk is unfortunately a bit too unreal, you don`t achieve the sympathy for the character, Lou`s Hulk received...But all in all; a GREAT movie and a great experience."
1,could've been good....,if i understood ANY part of it!!!!most of it was stupid when they were talking it was boring and then they went too extreme with the action scenes and i didn't understand why bruce's dad sent those dog's after him because they went to that cabin way out in the woods and how did he know they were there in the first place? and also the ending when they were fighting the hulk simply punched his dad and he blew up? what was that for anyway??
3,not horrible/ not great.,"Two problems: 1)I couldn't understand most of what nick nolte was saying2) the movie was too dark.P.S.OK three problems, whatever happened to explaining why nick nolte turned into some kind of electrical giant at the end?"
4,Now I can see it,"With the DVD version, there was always at least one scene that was too dim to see - the forest battle with the giant dogs. Often you could not see where the monsters went, even though they were onscreen and should have been visible. This happened with several brands of DVD player, so I don't really think it was the rendering method's fault.In the HD-DVD version all the parts of this scene were visible, and the increased detail made it even better. Very nice, it made a favorite movie even nicer. No issues with my Toshiba player either, so long as the firmware is the final release version."
2,AAAAAAAAHH He's Green!,"This movie is funny as hell. It wasn't meant to be a comedy, and I went to Ryder's house as a comic fan expecting to see a serious adaptation of the comic books. What I got instead was a 1950s B-Movie mockery of a riddle. There's a scene in this movie where Hulk is locked up and talking to his dad. His dad all of a sudden starts ranting about how the military is conquering everything in its path, which had nothing to do with anything. While he's talking, Banner starts screaming for no apparent reason. I laughed my ass off during that scene. It was funny man. Not as funny as when me and Ryder tried to copy the scene from Spiderman, but all we had was silly string, and Ryder fell down and smashed up his XBOX, I was laughing my ass off, and his head was bleeding all over. Damn, that was a funny day."
3,VERY SLOW MOVIE BUT ~OK~,I watched this movie 1 time & I was not impressed with the pace of the movie. I enjoyed about the last 30 to 35 min of complete action. If you are a fan of the comics I guess you may enjoy this movie. I however enjoyed some of the helicopter scenes & watch lots of stuff blow up near the end of the feature bout thats about it.
4,Monster Mash,There was plenty of criticism about this film. However I thoroughly was entertained by it. I thought it did drag until the Hulk's first appearance which isn't until about 45 minutes into the film. After that it is very good in my opinion. The dog fight scene was tremendous...watching the hulk jump from mountains to bridges to canyons was very cool...although the animation wasn't given great reviews I thought they did a tremendous job making the Hulk seem lifelike. Isn't it great to see a giant Hulk breaking the front of a tank in half.:) The ending was kind of wierd and definitly leaves room for a sequel but nevertheless I think the effects will keep you wanting to watch this movie more then the story.
3,ALEXS CAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS,"Highlights: The best `comic book feel' ever created in film; Sam Elliot's performance; the culmination fumes with vigor; script.Lowpoints: Runs a little too long; Hulk looks cartoony; pretentious at times.Conclusion: While some scenes, like when Hulk holds on to a jet that soars so high stars could be seen, smolder with potency, Ang Lee's venture into comic-book territory does not entirely live up to its hype. Once the viewers get used to the digital Hulk though, they are bound to appreciate the intelligent screen-play, decent performances and amazing comic-book style editing that Hulk has to offer. In addition, the final half an hour of the film will leave anyone breathless.SEE THIS IF YOU LIKED: Ghostbusters, King Kong, An American Werewolf in London, Crouching Tiger...DON'T SEE THIS IF YOU LIKED: The Lost World, Daredevil, Apocalypse Now."
2,Hulk,"This Hulk was inaccurate to the comics. It had few scenes of great comic enjoyment. It's not that great, and I knew when I bought it. I only wanted to have it to my superhero collection. And Lee isn't a bad director. In fact, there are some moments when he does a superb job, and other times I feel like he was just not fit to take the lead in a movie like this."
1,I hated this movie!,"This movie was so incredibly lame and hard to follow. It was weird! I couldn't get into it at all. Not like I expected it to be. I guess my mistake was watching the Avengers, a really great movie by the way, before watching this one. I'll never get that time back and I'm more stupid for having watched it...."
5,Best,"Everything about the first one is far better than the second. Acting, script, fight scenes, the entire story far surpasses the second."
3,"Pretty Good, But You Have To Wait On It","Once the action kicks in, this is entertaining story and the Blu-Ray transfer here is one of the best I've seen: very, very sharp. That alone made me elevate the rating.I mention the above because, boy, this film got panned by a lot of people when it came out. Much of the criticism was probably warranted, but it wasn't all that bad a film.It had its entertaining segments. For instance, the second scene with ""The Hulk"" fighting three dogs was very intense.One of the problems was that it took 41 minutes for our hero, ""The Hulk,"" to show up! For a ""superhero movie,"" that's too long for the audience to wait. Don't get me wrong: I don't want one of these brainless nonstop action movies, but this was a tad too much in other direction. It needed just a little more spark to keep the audience involved.It was good to see they gave Lou Ferrigno a guest shot. That was a nice touch. Lou played the ""monster"" on the successful TV series."
3,"A nice attempt, but far to little action and Hulk.","OK, i know most origin stories for comic book movies tend to be weak sometimes, but this film takes FOREVER to get us to the Hulk(and lets face it that IS what we want to see)! Once he comes on screen the movies soars and is very good (I loved the series but the cgi hulk is better than a man in green makeup). The cast is good as is the direction but the movie feels limp for long stretches and is really a mixed-bag."
3,"Hulk is overlong, but worth a look","Hulk is a movie badly in need of some editing and a much better ending. On HD DVD the film looks real good, and the movie does have cool moments like Hulk tearing up the M-1 tanks. But, the ending is ridiculous, even my comic book film standards, and the first 2/3 of the movies is tedious at times, esp. when compared to gems like Spiderman and Batman Begins, which offer excellent creation stories for their superheroes."
3,a notch better than last years spider-man,"last years spider-man didnt really grip me. though x-men 2, daredevil and this one right here did. Eric Bana(Black Hawk Down and Chopper) is great as the green man. Connelley is sexy as always and Nolte is well, he needs a new hairduo is all im saying. but I really liked this movie and I ignored my friends opinions on it as well. great visuals by Ang Lee and also great direction as well. sorta played like a comic book splitting the scenes in half and all and the hulk visuals are spectacular. one more note. They coulda done without those damn mutated dogs, what the (beep) was that all about. Inject Fluffy with the crap and Fluffy turns to Spike, anyway."
2,Come on you can do better than this,"OH My lord, where do I start. The stroy line just seemed stupid as hell and the action was very good. that's the only reason I even gave it a two out of five. It just was a slow ass movie, I'm sorry but it just was. Maybe when they make the second Hulk Movie their have people with sense to make it."
4,An above average comic book to movie translation.,"Wednesday, March 31, 2004 / 4 of 5 / An above average comic book to movie translation. I found Ang Lee's treatment of the Hulk mythos to be interesting and compelling. While some liberties were taken with the back story and creation of the Hulk, I think it worked out pretty well. The pure CG Hulk himself doesn't detract but does serve to stand out against humankind and nature. Banner's dad as the Absorbing Man was a bit of a stretch, couldn't they have waited for a Thor film for that? Still, the effects for the Absorbing Man were good while he was on film. Oh Jennifer Connely, where are those fit and full days of the HotSpot and Rocketeer? You're too thin and look sickly now, it saddens me to have to say. Overall the cast does a bang-up job especially Sam Elliot as Thunderbolt Ross. Bruce Banner is adeptly played w/ wide range by Eric Bana. There are some Crouching Tiger angles and sensibilities sprinkled about if you watch for them. Recommended."
2,Hulk want to bash the director and crew!!!!!!,"This movie had some good acting and digital animation but came out lame. Why? Because of the corney events that happened in the movie. Ex. the crazy man eating dogs, hulk jumping miles high in the air, and hulks father turning into a giant electrical monster near the end of the movie. What the hell were they thinking. Didn't any of them say, this sounds sorts of corney. Rent but don't buy this movie because there's to much talk and you'll probably be put to sleep by it. The best Marvel movies are X-men and blade. The rest have great graphics and some good acting but come out short. Image comics should start coming out with some good movies. Darkness would be my first pick."
2,Shame on you Universal,"Universal deserves to be punished for this. This DVD forces you watch about 5 minutes of previews, WITHOUT the ability to skip past them. Patently dishonest on the part of the studio, especially since the previews were for some sexy movies, that I wouldn't normally want my son to see. AND THEN I see that there are no English subtitles in the disc, so that my wife, who is Japanese, had to go without understanding the movie. FINALLY, there was something wrong with the audio. I had to turn the volume up to the highest level on the TV to hear most of the dialogue. I will punish Universal by avoiding their next few titles."
1,Not a good movie.,This movie was not good at all. The way the movie would show three different things happening at one or three different views of one thing happening was very distracting to me. I did not like the movie at all and I personally think that it was a waste of my time and money to go see it. Not a good movie to buy.
3,Underrated,The Hulk movie was definitely underrated. The movie was about 30-45 minutes too long and dragged at parts but the action was awesome. The CGI Hulk was incredible and looked much more real in the film than on previews. This is a good movie when you have over 2 hours to kill and there's not much else on.
2,"This was not the Hulk,.",I do not know what this movie was supposed to be about. I could not stand the spilt screen editing nor the battle with the Gamma Dogs. That was stupid.
2,Green with Confusion,"I remember when I went to see the American version of GODZILLA back in the 90's. The one with Matthew Broderick. What a mess. I asked my friends, ""How on earth can you screw up making a Godzilla movie?""But they did.I was asking the same question when I saw THE HULK. But the answer came a little easier: the filmmakers wanted to make MORE of the story than there was. Get into the Hulk's inner child and psychology. Blah, blah, psycho-blah.We want to see the Hulk throw more tanks.We want to see him foil villians who try to use him for their own nefarious purposes.You've got hundreds of comic books and dozens of TV shows to cobble a cool plot from.You blew it.And...that...just...makes me...ANGRY!You killed a movie franchise faster than Joel Schummacher."
2,Well...,"I am still not sure what to think of this movie. Let's look at some aspects.Acting: no really worth mentioning, except maybe Nick Nolte.SFXs: The Hulk is of course a fantastic piece of special effects. It's hard to believe it's entirely CGI.Dialogue: Even Star Wars is betterBelievability: Jumping for miles? going into space? no seriously, the old hulk was in some strange way believable.Not a good movie, think I'm gonna watch Lee's 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' again. That movie still blows me away. The Hulk certainly did not."
3,Undecided approach,"ON THE BAD SIDE:The story takes long to develop.You might have to watch it twice to get a few details.The scene where they make a gross attempt to speak Spanish was embarrasing. It was as close to real Spanish, as the TexMex food is to real Mexican food.Sometimes you end up wondering whether you're watching Hulk or Superman, 'cause now he can fly.ON THE GOOD SIDE:-Once the story develops it gets entertaining for a big while-The scene of the fight with the dogs was great. That by itself makes it worth to rent the movie.-The main 3 actors do act very well.TO SUMMARIZE:I did have fun watching this movie. I recommend you rent it, but I really sugest you don't buy it, unless you are collecting all of these ""comics"" movies."
3,"A Good Movie, not a Great Movie.","Ang Lee directed this film as if he was impressed with himself, impressed with his split screens and editing, impressed with his ""artistry."" In this blender of pretention, the Hulk I grew up on manages to peak through.Okay, we do have to creep through scenes of heavy handed angst and repression.Still, once the Hulk breaks out of his clothes, the fun begins!The CGI Hulk is at times totally convincing, at other times plastic looking. Too bad the effects wizards weren't more consistent.There are still plenty of great effects, many ""Hulk Smash"" scenes, and the soundtrack is incredible!!The concluding battle is too brief, but at least this movie has more ""jaw dropping"" moments than the average super-hero film.Jeff Messenger, the author of ""the Shroud of Torrington."""
2,How do you make The Hulk boring?,"By taking it too seriously. That's how. This thing labors along like it thinks it's Schindler's List. It's a comic book movie. Where's the joy? The adventure? The freaking FUN? It's buried under an over-long expository first act, bad over-acting (Sam Elliot), bad under acting (Eric Bana), and some really silly concepts (a hulk poodle?).And just because people keep saying the CGI ""looks real"", it doesn't make it so. It's good CGI, but in the end that's all it is. They just don't have the technology to do a realistic human face yet. So forr all of the effort that went into it, the result is just distracting.This gets 2 stars for the small amount of action scenes near the end that didn't make me want to sleep."
2,Exactly. Watch it if your a Hulk fan.,"The Incredible Hulk with rising star, Eric Bana (Finding Nemo), Jennifer Conolly, and a great performance by Nick Nolte. Unlike Spider-Man and Daredevil, The Hulk has a small time starring actor. The Hulk was truely a disapointment for me. It moved too fast, the story was hard to follow, but non-the-less, great performances. If your a big Hulk fan, you should watch it. The action scenes are good but the story and dialogue just screwed it up. With a great director like Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) this movie looked like it would be a hit but instead just a disapointment."
3,Enjoyable no brainer.,"I enjoyed this film. I read a review in one of the English newspapers (Mail on Sunday) recently that panned the film as boring and lacking in plot but the Hulk is BIG, green and he smashes things which, lets be frank, is what you want from the Hulk. Its a no brainer for sure but so what, every film doesn't have to be exam material. There are times when the CGSFX make the Hulk seem a little like Morph from Take Hart (this will mean more to English readers than non English) especially when he's moving through the desert but overall I was certainly rooting for him and look forward to the sequel, I'd like to see him take on his arch nemesis the Rhino."
2,Yes I read the comics Yes I saw the movie,"I thought this movie was gonna be good from the trailer but i was sadly disapointed. I have read the comics and enjoy those and i love the batman and spiderman movies but this i thought was not that great. I was actually bored in the movie. Parts of it were ok and others I was just thinking ""O come on"". The special effects were good and the cinemetography was excellent, and I like the actor that plays Bruce Banner, but the plot and everything else was iffy. I would say wait till this movie comes out to dvd to see it. Its not worth your night off, go see hollywood homicide."
3,"Impressive but, WAY too long...","Jennifer Connelly is a beautiful woman. But they must have set a record for the number of close-ups. The scenes between the two main characters were basically a full close-up of HER face as she said her line then a full close-up of HIS face as he said his line and then back to her, back to him.... After 20 minutes of that, I was yawning in spite of the intense acting. The action scenes were excellent but everything in between the action scenes moved soooo slow. The Hulk scene's were great, the best, in spite of the ""cartoon"" Hulk. The movie overall was good, it was just too long and too slow. The last 15 minutes however, were excellent!!"
2,Not Easy Being Green,"The CGI is good, better than how it looks on a TV. The movie is just too serious for a comic book. It seems to lag in some parts and could have been shorter then 2 hours plus. For such a hyped film, it wasnt that good."
4,good movie...,another comic book turned movie... the late hulk movie about 20 years ago was a ed wood in my book but this one is loaded with cgi and just a good movie. better then daredevil the action is great except for the carried on begining... they dragged on the characters a little to much. well not as good as spiderman or x men it is deffetally a good movie to see on a boring day interesting tid bit that ang lee the director turned down the change to direct terminator 3 to direct this! COMPLETELY SURPRIZING but probably should have been
3,Why are all the superhero movies all so bad?,"A pattern is starting to develop here. All the superhero movies with the exception of the X-men in recent years have all been terrible. Why is that? I think the big reason is that the studios emphasize the wrong things. First and foremost they ought to work on the story, but the screenplay often seems to be an afterthought. Instead, they focus on who is going to star in the film, and on all the special effects. At least THE HULK showed signs of the filmmakers trying to make a good movie. They tried to do more with the plot than in, say, THE DAREDEVIL or the first SPIDERMAN. I will add that I think the next SPIDERMAN could be really good, because Michael Chabon did the story. But we'll have to see what happens."
3,"Not a ""feel- good"" movie!","Hmmm.I didn't feel too good after watching this film.I love dark,moody films that are beautifully made but Ang Lee misses the mark with this brooding downer.I'm a long time HULK fan,from the comics to the tv series,and Lee doesn't succeed in making the green guy or Banner sympathetic at all.THE HULK deserves better."
3,Background info for Avengers,Somewhat a complete history of the Hulk. The background information leading to the creation of the hulk was a little challenging in my opinion but it does add fictional credibility to the story line. The Blu-ray rendition of the Hulk character sometimes reveals the digital graphics but it definitely enhances all other aspects of the cinematography. Well worth the money if you are interested in completing timelines of all Avengers characters.
1,there's 5-star reviews for......this????,what the heck is wrong with this movie?it's so confusing why not make it a LITTLE bit more sense??if there is a sequel please i hope they make it better like this:1.make a little more sense2.have an actor that's not bored!!3.maybe raise the action up alittle but not enough to make you sick.4.have the hulk talk!!that's it!!
3,grade B film,"This is a well made movie with its special effects. However, the story line is not as interesting as the original tv series with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno."
2,"HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, BUT IT LOOKS CHEESEY.","I GAVE IT 2 STARS BECAUSE I LIKED THE T.V. SHOW WITH BILL BIXBY AND LOU FERIGNO, IT WAS VERY WELL ACTED AND WRITTEN AND IT HAD GREAT F/X. PLUS IT WAS BELIEVABLE. THIS MOVIE, BASED ON WHAT I'VE SEEN IN PREVIEWS, LOOKS VERY, VERY HOKEY. THE F/X LOOK STUPID FRANKLY, WITH THE HULK BEING SOME KIND OF GIANT JUMPING AND RUNNING AROUND AND THE EARTH ACTUALLY SHAKING UNDER HIM. THEY COULD HAVE WENT THE MORE BELIEVABLE ROUTE AND JUST MADE HIM LOOK MORE LIKE HE DID IN THE SERIES, A VERRY LARGE PI__ED OFF MAN, AND NOT SO CARTOONISH. I HOPE THE ACTING AND WRITING PULL THIS MOVIE, WHICH I WILL PROBABLY SEE, ABOVE WHAT LOOKS LIKE SOME VERY SERIOUS F/X FLAWS."
1,Not the 2008 version,"This is the original with eric bana, and it was HORRIBLE...if you want to see mutant dogs fight hulk and him jumping around with the weirdest storyline, go for it, actually spend your money on gas instead, its more useful..."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?,"Is this a movie or a cartoon mix up?The actor seems great for the part I must say but when his charater goes green with envy, it can only scream... BIRTH DEFECT! A few words for the ones behind this effortless project : Does the word realistic mean anything at all? Maybe this movie wasn't ready to hit the big screen just yet, since it seems digital artists now a days aren't paying much attention to life like graphics 101. Only those who cross the youth limit of age 35 can only get so hyped about wasting time & money on this cartoon.. I mean movie. Matrix Reloaded and X2 will run over this road kill a few hundred times."
3,What the??,"I was very much looking forward to this movie, but then I happened to see the preview on Super Bowl Sunday. Was that a joke. It looked like a cartoon. How big was the Hulk? 15 feet tall. Swinging tanks around. Maybe im just used to the old TV show where the Hulk was a normal man, but freakin huge. I'm sure the movie will be good, but why can't the directors make stuff look real instead of like a computer game. That is just me though for comic book fans I'm sure they love it."
2,Outstanding Special Effects Can't Redeem Movie,"I anticipated this movie greatly. Being a comic book hero fan, I was looking forward to a spetacular movie with a notable director, fine cast, and padded budget; yet, we get all these, but an otherwise flat movie based on a flat scripted.The film has its moments like the ""Hulk vs the dogs"", but besides a few moments here and there, one's mind starts to wonder because of the sheer silliness and overly done multiangle filming.The end, as the Hulk/Banner battels his father (uninspiring performance by Nolte) is just anti-climatic and boring. Sam Elliot provides the screens best performance as Jennifer Connely's father."
1,WORST MARVEL FILM YET,"This film is a complete creative disaster. The origin of the Hulk has been altered in a way that completely obliterates the character, the plot is nonexistant, the dialogue laughable, the split-screens pointless, and the Hulk's face looks like a fat pouty Eric Bana. If you are unfortunate enough to find yourself in the theater, stay for the jaw-droppingly bad third act super-villain...and then try to explain what you just saw. This was supposed to be a fun superhero monster movie, not a boring and stupefying repressed-memory melodrama. Ang Lee was the wrong director for this film, but the real blame goes to the producer and writer: Shame on you, Schamus."
1,Mediocre...,"This has got to be one of the most boring movies ever made. It took WAY too long to get to the point. The only reason I'm posting this now is just to make sure people do not base the 2nd movie off of thier opinions of the first. The new Hulk is 1000 times better. Go see it! I have had to tell at least a dozen people that it was actually good and not half as sucky as the first. My advice: Skip this one, and go staight to the movies and watch the second."
2,it is VERY violent!!,"ok first, they have bruce when he was a toddler and his dad is a complete maniac! i mean he did experiments on his own kid!!! then he tortured bruce's mom? and THEN he turns into a monster hulk and finally KILLS the mom!!! what the heck are they trying to do? then they have some kind of hulk-dog thingys that he punches and tears them in half??? YUCK that is disgusting!!!and this is from a kid who watches jurassic park 1,2,3!!!! I do not reccomend this for 1,2,3,4,5 year olds. maybe even 6!!! oh yeah and his pants fall off when he turns back into bruce!!"
1,It's not the same HULK of the comics....,"From all the recent MARVEL films, the HULK films are by far the worst ones...The HULK is totally different from the hulk of the comics...I know the movie got to put on real form characters from a magazine, but the story of this Hulk is really uninspired...I mean, who is this Bruce Banner father??? and HULK became childish, without the furor and anger of the comics...In my opinion, the HULK films are not good...try spider man or x men...."
1,You're making me bored...you wouldn't like me when I'm bored,This movie is beyond boring. If you're an insomniac I think I've found your cure.
1,The Hulk In Name Only,"The Hulk in this movie is not the Hulk comic fans know, that's for sure. Plenty of other reviews here will tell you how the story is off the mark, so I'll concentrate on something not many mentioned: The Hulk is around 20 feet tall in this movie.In the comics, the Hulk gets stronger the madder he gets, which is usually when he's getting worked over. In this movie he expands in size when he gets hit with bullets, and he can't be harmed. This transforms the movie from a Frankenstein-like story to a King Kong-like story, which is far less interesting. The Hulk is even animated as if they were trying to make him look like the claymation used in the original Kong.Finally, Hulk not talk which made Chris mad and made Chris want to smash stupid movie seat. And take green paper back from red faced dirty kid who took green paper to sit on dirty chair too long!!!"
1,Let's see here....,"Horrible acting...CheckSpecial effects that make the Hulk look like he was made out of Play-Dough...CheckA LSD induced sequence...CheckJimmy-tapping a giant poodle...CheckIncredible stretchy pants that grow to fit the hulk, fall of so we can see some guys buttocks, then when the hulk turns normal again stay on and are a perfect fit...CheckAbsolute crap that made me want to get my $2 back...Check"
1,zzzZZZZzzzzzZZZZZzzzzzZZZZZ,"When this movie was still playing in theaters I really wanted to go and see it, yet most everyone that I knew that had already seen it insisted that I avoid it at all cost. I finally, watched it on DVD and I swear the movie put me flat out to sleep!!! I have heard that Jennifer Connelly wanted to back out of it because it was the next film that she did after her ""A Beautiful Mind"" award but she was under contract - - - who knows? But one thing most of us realize about this movie is . . it really stinks!!!"
1,This movie sux! Why do you people like it?!,"This movie sux1 There is no plot. Barely any action. Doesnt turn into the hulk till three fourths of the movie through. Honestly why do you people like this movie, i dont understand.Its a stupid love story. And what in the world was that fight between him and his father and the end. you could not even see what in the world was going on.but anyway dont see it!"
1,even cheese would have been better,"I like comics. I like superhero movies. I don't like this one. The story lost control of itself somewhere. Plot lines were left just dangling in the wind. And for some reason, the hulk chooses bouncing around as his mode of transportation. Did he fill up on gummy berry juice? Great actors were wasted. And apparently the transition between scenes is more important than the scene itself. There was a story here, but I don't know what happened to it."
1,Could pull a better film out (...),"This is a real load of crap! thats all there is to it, nothing exciting about this film, I actually saw it when it was in Theatres, it was so boring, i fell asleep and, demanded my money back after the screening.Ever since i have attempted to watch this film, i have fallen asleep, maybe if i buy myself a copy, i can just play it whenever i can't sleep, all anyone can say about this film is ""it is crap""!"
2,BORING!!,"This is NOT an action movie. I have never seen such a movie that was SUPPOSED to have special FX and action and had none. Well, other then Spider-man 2. This movie has about 10 minutes of action towards the end, but 95% of it is just talk, or some scietific blather that the normal-brained person can't understand. There is too much gooey sentementalism and dull childhood flashbacks that will bore you to death. If the entire movie had been like the one action sequence in the whole movie, this would be a 5-star movie. Avoid at all costs."
3,Hulk,"This was an interesting take on the Hulk although a bit misguided in its stretch of the original story.I'm still not sure about the computer generated green guy, but the movie is worth buying for all of the Jennifer Connelly close ups."
1,A Complete Misfire,"The only thing incredible about this Hulk was my disappointment. What a letdown - a boring letdown - and a wasted opportunity. I expected more from Ang Lee. The only saving grace was Jennifer Connelly's amazing cleavage, which never disappoints. Thank you, Jennifer."
3,Hulk,"The special effects in this movie make it a ""I wanna see it"" flick. The storyline is ponderous at times and altogether predictable."
2,Wow! This really makes me appreciate the TV show,"Despite having a great cast and director, the Hulk movie is a total dud.The main problem for me is the CGI rendition of the Hulk is cartoonish and absurd- throughout the movie, it's impossible to feel any empathy (like King Kong) for the titular character! They really should have cast a human being (with some CGI) like the TV show (or hired the F/X team that did the Lord of Rings).The second major problem is a very weak script that may be mostly Ang Lee's fault. The father-son conflict (at the heart of the movie) was poorly conceived and the storyline is very weak and boring. This movie really makes me appreciate the Incredible Hulk pilot from 1977, which starred Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno. I'd have much preferred seeing a remake of that then this ill-advised, expensive flop."
1,You couldnt pay me to wach it again,THIS MOVIE WAS THE CRAPPIEST STUPIDEST AND MOST PAINFUL MOVIE I HAD TO EVER WATCHTHIS MOVIE WAS SO TERRIBLE I WOULD NEVER WACH IT AGAIN NOT EVEN FOR 100BUCKS IT WAS STUPID BORING AND PAINFUL TO WATCH IF YOU LIKE SUPER HERO MOVIES GET SPIDER MAN BAT MAN OR POSSIBLY SUPER MAN BECAUSE THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING BUT TRUE TERRIBLE CRAP I WOULD RATHER WATCH TELLITUBIES OR BARNEY OR POOH BEAR THEN WATCH THIS CRAP ITS NOT WORHTING SPENDING MONEY TO WACH THIS MOVIE THE PERSON WHO SEES THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE PAID TO WACH IT DONT BUY DONT RENT JUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE I GIVE THIS PIECE OF GREEN CRAP MINUSE 10000000 STARS
1,i COULD'VE liked it.....,"but i don't. the next time i watch a superhero movie i'm approaching with EXTRA,EXTRA caution i guess spider-man has his own category because i expected hulk like to be like that,but it was not!! the violence was extra,extra high!!! didn't they know little kids watch this stuff??"
2,zzzzzzzzzz,"This movie was a bit dull for a comic book adaption...the 1st 40 minutes was about the origin..an extended origin unlike the comic and could have been alot less dealt with..Finally, the Hulk shows up and most of the fight scenes--ARE IN THE DARK??? you couldn't make things out...Since the storyline was so dragged out you would have thought the technical effects would have balanced the movie out, but i was a disappointment...hopefully a sequal will be made with a different writer and a btter HULKmovie will be brought more to the comic fan..."
2,"Ang Lee,what went wrong?!","This movie is [weak]. I dont care what anyone says,it was really [weak].Ang Lee spent so much time on making the Hulk look real that he forgot the rest of the movie.True,the Hulk looked amazing,but theres no excuse for this wanna be action flick.And what was up with the comic book like panels on the screen?They were just plain annoying.Phsycological issues? Yeah right.I was having severe phsychological issues once I left the theatre.[Weak] action,(the most exciting part was when the Hulk got attacked by ... poodles)boring scenery(all desert or military complex)and did I mention [weak] action? Lets just hope there isnt a sequel."
1,Astonishingly bad,"I have to say I'm surprised how many people seem to like this movie. It is mind-numbingly bad! The plot wallows in some supposedly meaningful dialog as everyone does their best to be brooding and deep. The computer generated Hulk is itself a major disappointment, they were turning out superior CGI well over ten years ago. In fact it reminded me of the old stop motion photography they used in the 50s...Still, I suppose it shows what 21st century marketing can do. Taking over $60 million on opening weekend is no mean feat."
3,Passes time,"We all know it is a no-no to do genetic experiments on people. And once again a scientist David Banner has to do it to himself. Now to compound the problem he passes a trait onto his offspring Bruce Banner (Eric Bana). Add a little lab accident and et voila instant hulk.This is not the best integration of real, animation and CGI. Yet the story is told and you have fun watching. There is a father / son conflict and a misunderstood Hulk dismantles a lot of military equipment with extreme prejudice. This film does not try to follow the TV series and is not so dated. The only real drawback is that Jennifer Connelly is just too cute and you forget to keep track of the story line.Labyrinth [Blu-ray]"
1,This DVD does not work,"We have a DVD player plus 2 VCR/DVD players and it will not work on any of them. When ordering it it did not state that it needed a special player, I have one disappointed grandson."
3,Good movie,Good Movie. Would have preferred that it was based more on the original movie but it does have more action scenes and less drama. You will enjoy it.
3,Weird plot & funky frames,"I'm glad I rented this rather than buying. I've been enjoying the Marvel series but this wasn't a highlight. It's nice to see more origins, since I never read the comics. The frames used in this movie remind me of a bad picture-in-picture rather than deliberate visual effects, and are way overdone, and the story lacked a compelling plot line. Guess it was worth the rental price."
3,A different view of the Hulk,"A slightly different take on the Hulk story, a little slower a little more intimate but worth watching for a different angle."
1,The Worst of the Worse,"I didn't waste my money seeing ""Hulk"" at the cinema, but I sure did waste my money renting it! ""Hulk"" has to be the most boring film ever made. I mean, the movie was so boring, that my brother and I couldn't even crack jacks at it. My brother eventually fell asleep, but I forced myself to stay awake until the end. Why the heck did I torture myself like that? Anyway, ""Hulk"" sucks big time. Hardly no action and just a bunch of jumping over mountains and deserts. Family Movie Night was ruined!"
3,Most Underrated Comic Book Film Around,"It seems that I am the only one in the world that enjoyed this movie. All of my friends hate it, and I don't know why. It is a little slow getting started, but ounce the Hulk gets big and green it non-stop action and fun. Ang Lee tried a little too hard to make this flim a moving comic book (alot of split-sceen stuff), and Eric Bana is limited by his C.G.I co-star (best digital performance ever).Nick Nolte and Oster winner, Jenifer Conly give riviting performances. Do yourself a favor and rent the Hulk. Look past the corny comic antics and enjoy the film. I can't wait for Hulk 2."
1,Shrek on steroids,"This movie is all special effects and no heart. You'll probably find yourself wondering who to root for since no characters are really likeable. If you really like The Hulk, check it out but otherwise, its not worth your time."
2,Would be rated 5 if sold $5,"You'll find the action in the second part of the film and then you can enjoy all special effects showing Hulk strengh against the World First Army. During the first part, you get a real headache following the pre-life of Hulk."
4,This is actually a good movie,"I just watched this movie yesterday--because I liked Ang Lee's latest _Brokeback Mountain_. I have another motivation: people have been saying that _The Hulk_ is the one of the worst movies ever made, so I wanted to see how bad that was.Then it turned out that this movie is not only entertaining, but also thoughtful. This movie, I personally believe, elevated the status of the comic to something meaningful, which means that ""ordinary"" people like us can relate; it touches on a dark desire that we want (?) to resist. It seems that ""desire"" is Ang Lee's theme; if you look at his filmography, it is quite consistent. Every movie of his deals with the conflicts as well as unexpected heroism one's desire creates."
1,Buy those cool Hulk hands so you can smash this DVD!!,"Whenever the subject comes up all you read (or hear) is how bad this movie is and how disappointing it was. However, I never heard of many reasons as to why it's so bad. Well after viewing it for myself I realize that yes it's bad. I'll tell you what I think is bad about it. After a painfully boring first 40 minutes which explains how science can go wrong (been there, done that) you come to realize that now that the HULK is finally present the action isn't. Well at least it's boring and unexciting action. The CGI of the HULK is unique, but I'm not sure that's a good thing. I'd rather have a real live actor play the key title role in a live action comic book movie. Bad script w/ bad dialogue and I hate how director Ang Lee had 2 to 4 squares on the screen at one time. Even on a big screen t.v. it wasn't possible to follow. If you still plan to buy this DVD, buy those Hulk hands with it so after you watch it, you can Hulk smash it."
2,WTF was Ang Lee THINKING!?,"What was Ang Lee thinking when he made this flick. Alright... here's the good part... the animation was AMAZING. The hulk looked and felt and reacted like a real human...(sorta) but the plot was so !@#$ing weak. I mean... seriously, I went to support the industry, and to see the re-birth of the hulk, but where can they go from here? It was ghastly. Details left for the imagination. Why did his shorts look fine in the morning when he woke up again as Bruce Banner. Were they spandex? Come on man, let's cover the details! ugh..."
3,"Unfortunately, I can see why this bombed in the theaters...","People have two views of the Hulk: Bill Bixby wandering from place to place and inadvertantly righting wrongs via his green growling alter-ego, or the monosyllabic Green Goliath duking it out with a variety of monstrous villians in the old comic books. (Personally, my favorite incarnation was Peter David's intelligent Hulk of about 10 years ago.)Unfortunately for the bean-counters (and the Hulk fans) it failed to live up to any of the expectations. Ang Lee put together an artsy, slow-paced psychological drama with a few sequences of moderately enjoyable Hulk action. Throw in a somewhat confusing ending and you have a box office bomb (or should that be a box office dud?)Sorry, Marvel. After an excellent film version of Spider-man and a good translation of the X-men, this just wasn't what people were looking for. Wish I could recommend it, but it's only going to work if you go in with a VERY open mind (and maybe not even then.)"
1,The Hulk lacks power,"My favourite is Incredible Hulk tv series and I am fan of Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.The Hulk was slow paced, confusing story, poor performances and the ending was terrible. Sadly, Ang Lee was always risk and the not right director in this film."
5,All appraisal of appraisement to Ang Lee!,"I can't consider it the best of characters that based from comics like a Spiderman , X-Men or others .... & about the music it was very good specially beside the special effects !this movie should be loves from present generations as loved it the past generations ... who's knows the HULK well on the comics !at last ... DON'T MISS IT !"
3,A Let Down ...,"The movie was good, although I was let down; it was not as good, as I thought it would be from all the previews that we were bombarded with before the release.Eric Bana, is a good {Aussie} actor, and definitely a new face in town, so to speak."
1,Painful,"I decided to give this movie another try after not having seen it since it's theatrical release. I often will re-watch a film years later after not liking it originally, only to find myself thoroughly enjoying it the second time through.This was unfortunately not one of those times. I won't quite go as far as calling it un-watchable. But dear God it was close to it. The acting is ok. But between the pacing which erratic and the plot which was so bad I actually wanted to go watch Gigli as a palate cleaner. It is very uncommon for me to hate on a movie. The exceptions of course being the prequels to my beloved Star Wars. I'll hate on those all day.I think I'll wait for them to legalize pot in my state. Then I'll try watching it again in another ten years.It can't be any worse than it is already."
1,Incredibly bad,"I didn't finish this movie. I couldn't stand the way it was shot, i guess trying to be a comic book or something. It was way too distracting. The Hulk when he finally appeared, looked horrible, i've seen better animation on South Park. This is the worst comic-book adaptation i've ever seen. The part with the dogs was incredibly stupid looking. I like how the constantly keep The Hulk in the shadows many times, hiding the bad effects and the fact the Hulk looked and acted nothing like the lead actor: they seemed unconnected, even though there the same person. And how about the storyline?, whoooaaaaa, is this magnolia or a comic book hero? lets stick to the source material guys. 1/2 a star. at least that gorgeous Brilliant Mind actress was in it."
2,Lost interest very fast,"While I appreciated Ang Lee's direction and cinematography of the film, I found myself becoming quite bored with the story. There were very few good moments, and they were quickly over-shadowed by the banality of the super-hero genre. Unfortunately, this movie did not offer anything new and spectacular... the best parts of the movie were 1) how high and far The Hulk could jump and 2) the desert landscape and shots in National Parks... and that is why I kept watching.If you want to see a comic-book adaptation, there are much better choices out there."
2,Tried to be too much,"This movie was a big disappointment. I was hoping for an entertaining flick, lots of action and fighting, etc. but instead it was kind of slow and tried to fill in way too much back story. Really we just want a story, don't we?, when we watch one of these comic book character driven movies, not the whole history.The computer effects were good and there are a couple of decent action scenes, in fact, if it means anything, my 2 and a half year old saw the ""green monster"" on the cover of the dvd and asked to see it. So I showed her the part of the movie from the previews, where the Hulk fights the tanks and helicopters. She made me replay it about 10 times, so I guess that's an endorsement of that sequence, too bad the rest of the movie couldn't keep up."
2,disappointed,"What a disappointment! The dialogue was weak, the story was boring and frankly absurd. Can't believe talented actors like Nolte and Connelly actually got through this film.I read that this was supposed to be deep- so what does deep mean we're talking about a guy who becomes a green giant when he gets mad and goes on a serious temper tantrum.There are no words to describe how awful this was.Haven't seen anything this bad since the first Star Trek film.I love a good drama but this didn't even have the elements to make it one and it obviuosly wasn't a typical action movie.SO what was it?I thought Crouching Tiger was an exceptional movie but this didn't even seem like it was done by the same person.Don't waste your time with this one.A disappointing offering from a very talented director..."
2,Good Movie-Shameless Commercials on the DVD,"The movie itself, effects and all were very good. Yes, the movie could've been paced a little better and the end was a bit anticlimactic. This I can forgive. What I can't forgive is the commercials for 2 Fast 2 Furious and some other flick on DVD, which you CAN'T skip on your DVD player. You can fast forward through them which takes several minutes, but cannot skip them and go to the Main Menu. This is the company's way of force feeding commercials on a DVD you bought for home viewing. Also, some of the ""Extras"" on the DVD are actually commercials. Yes. You click on the icons and see commercials for soft drinks and Mastercard. SHAMEFUL. I bought this DVD for the Movie. NOT commercials that don't allow you to skip to the Main Menu. In case you couldn't tell, I was pretty much disgusted with the way they released this DVD.Also there is no DVD insert with chapter stops. Just MORE Ads."
4,Hulk is Great!,"The hulk is a good movie. Just like the comic books and the tv series. A brooding David Banner and an enraged green HULK! The story and the effects are top notch. I can't wait for the sequel. Hopefully they don't junk it up because the first Hulk wasn't ""kid friendly""."
4,One slick flick!,"This movie is great! I wasn't even a big Hulk fan before watching it, but I was quickly converted by the film's excellent story telling and excellent cast. This film is definately noy a Spider-Man clone, as many people who saw it thought it would be, and it is definately a comic book film for older people. There is a much more complex and detailed story here than there was with Spider-Man, and I think it works excellent. The special effects are top-notch, and I think that this film deserves a spot on your shelf right next to X-Men, Spider-Man, and Daredevil."
4,what are those pants made of anyway?,"I have never been a fan of the Hulk, never read the comics, never seen the tv-show, but I really liked this movie!Wide-face Eric Bana gets angry and turns into big shirt ripping, light-green, roaring, walking bar-brawl, and those pants stay on forever man!The CGI are the best I've seen in a movie so far(the return of the king may change that)and the action parts are as exciting as ever.The only problem is that the movie is too long for its own good!Half an hour of talking, and Bana staring into your eyes is something you could live whitout!"
2,Skip this one,"This movie was a big-budget release, and they started previewing it a year in advance. So-so acting, with some very unrealistic visual effects, and a rushed plot. I've never been more disappointed with a movie, especially since The Hulk is one of my favorite Marvel Comic superheroes. I was glad at least to see Nick Nolte playing the Incredible Absorbing Man, the only, ONLY bright spot of the movie. There is bound to be a sequel which will not be a must see on my list."
5,I loved it,"I grew up watching the TV series and I was a little disappointed when I watched the trailers of the movie before the release. I went to watch anyway since I like Hulk in general. I was very pleased indeed. This is a good movie with lots of effort put in to make the characterization of Hulk as meaningful as can be for a comic book character. This may disappoint those who expect a mindless summer action flick. Otherwise, a fantastic movie with fantastic special effects. Ang Lee's genious shines through, as always, if you have the patience to take it all in."
4,"My father, the Absorbing Man...","Very good movie overall, but I would have done some things differently. First, chop 20 minutes off the front end, because it took a long time for Banner to change. Second, if we're going from the comic books, make the Hulk talk in the third person (i.e. ""Hulk smash puny humans like bugs!""). Last, if you're going to have a super-villain from the books, don't make it Bruce's DAD just for the sake of showing off the particular super-powers you want for the movie! But I really liked it despite these critiques, and I hope they can make the Leader or the Abomination look believable for a sequel!"
4,Underrated and Good (but audio was iffy while streaming),"This is a highly underrated movie. I rented it to watch with my nephew, and we both enjoyed it very much. However, the sound quality was terrible for some reason. I saw the movie in theaters years ago, and I don't recall missing half of the dialogue because it was too low to hear. Without that nuisance, the movie was great and altogether enjoyable. I'm not sure if the audio was a problem with Amazon or not, so I hesitate to jump to that conlcusion. But it sure would have been better to hear more of the film!"
4,Hulk Up with HD-DVD,"The major complaint about this under appreciated comic book movie is that it was slow moving. While I mostly agree with this complaint, I was blessed with an attention span - therefore, while it is drawn out, I had no issue staying involved in the movie, despite the Hulk not being one of the top-tier superheroes.The HD-DVD treatment is excellent for this title, especially when the viewer finally gets to the action. While the movie could have been better, it is still good and, over time, will be seen as the cinematic achievement that hasn't been trumpeted as of yet.If you appreciate the 'art' of comic books (framing and presentation, especially), then you will love this movie."
5,this movie will unleash your inner beast.,"this movie brung in a lot of green, I bet y'all anything. this is the best movie I bought. no cussing in it and no stupid pop stars in it. Eric Bana plays Bruce Banner, a scientist who becomes the Hulk after a lab accident. he was injected with nanomeds as a young child and then saves the life of a labmate by absorbing gamma radiation himself. Nick Nolte plays David Banner. David becomes a different creature by breathing in the chemicals and then exposing himself to the same gamma rays. later on, he gets electrified and therefore able to mesh with the environment. this is a good movie. why was it not called ""The Incredible Hulk"" like the TV series of the seventies?"
4,hulk -------->>>>> smashing good time!!!,"Some of the best cgi i have ever seen and very convincing.I have heard reviews say that this was to long of a movie.....hulk's evolution is very complex and requires alot of scientific explanation .Director ang lee expresses his feelings for bruce banner and the green menace with flare and compassion so little superhero films do these days .There are some fine performances in this film as well.Viually the film is breathtaking and mesmerizing ,The negativity is that this film is not light in the heart and that turns alot of people off instantly .Don't go in thinking this is the tv series revisited and you will have a rocking time!"
2,"Great potential, bad directing!","Yet another movie to fall to the clutches of a bad director. Great actors, they all fit their characters very well, but the movie simply tried to cover too many bases in one movie. It was like they took a 10 hour long movie, then just took parts of each scene, and pasted them together in a general order of occourance. And it was STILL too long and drawn out. About the first 2/3 of the movie is so slow I felt like just leaving so many times."
5,Action movie with depth and an actual plot,"I've always liked the Ang lee version of the Hulk even though at the time most people didn't. After watching the 2008 summer version of the Hulk (The Incredible Hulk), I had to say that I really hated the new 2008 version. I thought the movie had no plots, horrible action sequences, and was just plain dumb. The 2003 version is really good, and I was really looking forward to it be released on blu-ray. Now that it's coming out, I'm definitely buying it."
4,Good show,"Hey what can I say - I knew that another Hulk movie was around and as it goes I stumbled on this. Do not remember seeing it and read alot of the reviews prior to renting. As a few folks mentioned its not all action or infused with comic lines, however it was a first class movie. More likened in the genre to Captain America instead of Iron man, Avengers so on and so forth. I thought it was good in it's detailed presentation of establishing a history and have no complaints. Acting was good, and all the usual items one looks at in reviewing a flick. A Joss W. movie it isn't, but if your a superhero fan it doesn't fail at all. For a 3 buck rental or I believe 10 buck buy it's a worthy flick for the collection."
1,Hazardous Waste,"This movie is and utter waste of time. I am usually a big fan of comic book adaptions, but this is mind-bogglingly bad. The plot is either A. utter incomprehensible, or B. so bad you wish it was A. If you want quality entertainment, then Teen Titans, an ANIMATED CHILDREN'S CARTOON, is better than this."
1,Biggest Load Of Crap Ever Put On Film!!!!!!!,"This movie is so bad, it made me wish I was deaf and blind!"
2,Short and sweet,"I did not enjoy this movie. I thought it was overlong and unnecessarily deep compared to what it needed to be. Not only that, but Eric Bana was pathetic. I did not think Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton was fantastic by any means, but I did think it was much better than this."
3,Good adaptation of the comic series that does too much,"Good adaptation of the comic series that does too much too soon, and put too much of a story to make anyone feel turn off. Eric Bana makes a fine Bruce Banner And Jennifer Connelly makes a fine Betty but the movie does too much too soon with its plot and its characters. There is enough plot in here to make three movies, and not enough of the Hulk himself. This is one of those rare occasions that a sequel would be necessary because it at the very least a sequel would have continue the story and make the plot progression much better than having one movie that puts too much in the story too soon."
2,IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.,I TOOK MY 5 YEAR OLD TO SEE IT IN THE THEATER . THEY SPENT SO MUCH TIME BUILDING YOU UP THAT THERES HARDLY THAT MUCH HULK .
2,Slow and Plodding,"This movie could have been great,but they had to stray from the comic book orgin with a crazy story about Banners dad blowing stuff up and injecting himself with the chemicals that are passed to his son and help create the Hulk. This is all found out through split screen antics and alot of flashbacks that detract from the film. The movie is at its best with The HULK in action,his c.g. persona is quite beliveable and the action scenes are great. The actor playing Banner was mis-cast. He seems unlikeable from the start and we are tormented ourselves as we keep flashing back to his childhood. The first 40 miniutes are wasted why they try to describe all of this and how the HULK was created. I swear, the guy playing Banner was as stiff as a board in his acting except when we were treated to the transformation of The HULK. Good and bad."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,"Before I saw this movie I thought I would enjoy it. I enjoyed watching the miniseries when I was a kid. However, nothing could prepare me for what I was about to watch on screen. It was an absolute disaster of a film. I do enjoy superhero movies, some recent ones I like are the Spiderman series and Batman. But the Hulk did not inspire me at all, it was like going to the Dentist to get a tooth pulled. The character is a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a video game more than a movie. This film had no serious plot worthy of mention. It was just plain painful to watch. If I could give it half a star I would!"
1,JUNK,"JUNK is the word to call this movie. Why? What's Jennifer Connelly doing in this movie? Eric Bana has no expressions on his face, it's like a test dummy. Nick Nolte... he could be one of the best actors in movie history, now he's one of the biggest fiascos in movie history. The night scenes are so dark you have to guess what's going on. The script seems to be made on a weekend, and worse yet, who had the idea to devide the screen in 4 arts? You can't concentrate in the movie. Why they made this movie? The T.V. series were much better."
1,The catchphrase says it all...,"""Don't make me, Ang Lee. You wouldn't like me when I'm (directed by) Ang Lee."
1,the most awful hulk review you will read,i saw the hulk last saturday and my parents thought the whole story was awful because in the original series the characters didn't know who the hulk was but in the movie they knew who he was. i thought it was funny when the hulk picked people up they looked like dolls.
1,one word BAD!,this movie stunk. It was literally 2 1/2 hours long. The first 1 hour and 50 minutes is the plot with just talking and confusing plotlines. The action in the trailers is basically the only action you get from the movie. The action scenes don't come until the end. The only action you get is very slow paced. ...
2,Make sure you buy the 2008 version & not this one...,"I'm an avid movie watcher, and this one was absolutely dreadful. Even worse, they prolong the agony by making it over 2 hours long...I actually fell asleep.For any Incredible Hulk fans out there, be sure to buy the 2008 version and not this one. This year's version was easily better than the previous, and it isn't even close...anyone who tells you otherwise is delusional."
2,sucks,this movie sucks it is not good at all the incrediable hulk is way better the only thing i like about this movie is that the game for it is good but overall this movie sucks i would not recommend this.
3,This may not be what you think it is,"They seem to be going to great lengths to disguise the fact that this isn't this summer's ""Incredible"" Hulk. This is the Eric Bana/Ang Lee Hulk from 03. Just an FYI, I wanted to put that out there. I wouldn't have rated this but I was forced to in order to leave this comment."
1,The Abismal Hulk,"I have watched this movie several times, each in an attempt to understand the story. But each attempt at deciphering the story has been foiled by Ang Lee and his amazing ability to create the most confusing superhero movie ever.If you want to see Hulk smash up some stuff, buy this movie.If you want to see Hulk really smash up some stuff and actually have a good time watching the movie, buy The Incredible Hulk starring Edward Norton. Do not waste your time and money on this movie."
1,The Title Is Puke,"Puke is awesome their is a lot of chunks in puke and sometimes even snot.It tastes gross though.Their a lot of different kinds of it like dry,old,new,chunky,slimy,smelly,dog food,and plain old digusting then their some that are just plain barfy.If you enjoy reading this you would of probably enjoyed the movie Hulk which is just as crappy and moldy as this discussion.We're known as the Poopy Cheesenugget Men."
2,A HUGE CHUNK OF GREEN CHEESE.,"I LOVED THE ORIGINAL SHOW WITH MR. BIXBY AND MR. FARIGNO. THAT'S THE REASON I GAVE THIS MOVIE 2 STARS, OUT OF RESPECT FOR THAT SERIES. IT WAS WELL ACTED AND SCRIPTED AND VERY BELIEVABLE. THIS CGI MOVIE HOWEVER, LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE A HUGE CHUNK OF GREEN CHEESE. I'VE SEEN HORRIBLE MOVIES BEFORE THAT WERE BASED ON GREAT BOOKS AND WONDERED WHY THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW THE BOOK MORE CLOSELY. I KNOW THE HULK IS A COMIC BOOK CHARACTER, BUT I HAVE A FEELING THIS TIME I'LL BE WONDERING WHY THEY DID FOLLOW THE COMIC SO CLOSLY. LOOKS LIKE A HUGE GREEN MISTAKE."
1,Couldn't even finish it.,"The Hulk was so bad I couldn't even bring myself t finish it. After about an hr, I had enough. The trailer makes the film look so exciting, intense, and well made. However, it's a big mess. From the special effects to the acting. Eric Bana as the Hulk does a decent job, but Nick Nolte is horrendoes, and Jennifer Connelly is boring. She speaks in a whisper the whole film, and the only reason i can come up with as to why she does this, is to prove she is a serious Academy Award winning actress. The special effects are horrific. The Hulk looks so fake, and if Gollum from Lord of the Rings look real, why couldn't the Hulk. I admire Ang Lee for taking on such a project, but his comic book directing, with split screens and all are distracting. Skip the Hulk. It's a complete waste of time."
1,Bad Choice of Director + Bad Subject = Bad Movie,"First off, I used to be an avid comic reader but I NEVER read The Hulk on a regular basis because it was always about what he broke or who he beat up. Hulky boy was never that interesting to me, no matter what Stan Lee says.As I expected, the movie made all the wrong moves due, in large part, to Ang ""I can make a boring kung-fu movie and everyone will think that it is a big deal"" Lee. Audiences sat through long periods of Banner's whining and bouts of deep introspection to finally see the Hulk bust out and bust heads. Too little too late. The Mean Green Machine does'nt show up in the film for almost an hour, that is WAY too long.Like I said, there is nothing to the Hulk character, what made him interesting were the donneybrooks he had with comic heavyweights like Thor, Iron Man, The Thing. The whole child abuse angle was ridiculous too.It makes me wonder: Kung-fu films, now comic-based movies; is there any movie genre that Ang Lee can't ruin?"
3,Hilarious!!!,"This movie is funny as hell. It wasn't meant to be a comedy, and I went in there as a comic fan expecting to see a serious adaptation of the comic books. What I got instead was a 1950s B-Movie for the new millenium. There's a scene in this movie where Bruce Banner is locked up and talking to his dad. His dad all of a sudden starts ranting about how the military is conquering everything in its path, which had nothing to do with anything. While he's talking, Banner starts screaming for no apparent reason. I laughed my ass off during that scene.This is the funniest movie of the year. Guaranteed."
