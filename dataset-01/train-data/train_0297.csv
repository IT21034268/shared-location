4,Space efficient workout,I move around a lot and these fit the bill perfectly because they combine a clumsy weight tree into two dumbbells. I have used them a for a few weeks now and haven't had any issues. My only complaint would be that for the cost of these bad boys the elevated stand should be included.
5,These are Smartbells not Dumbbells,What could be better than eliminating all those weights and having to assemble them every time you want to exercise or change the amount you are pressing? This is the greatest invention at an unbelievably affordable price.
3,Only suitable for light workouts,"I purchased the SelectTech Dumbbells but returned them after a couple of weeks for two main reasons. First, they just weren't heavy enough. This is primarily my fault since I knew how much they weighed when I purchased them. 52.5 pounds just isn't enough weight for any kind of halfway serious male workout. Secondly, and more importantly, their build quality appears dangerously low. The mechanism securing the weights (which are allowed the move a great deal) to the dumbbell is plastic, and anything other than very careful handling would likely break it. I was never confident that the weights wouldn't fall off the dumbbell. Further, the mechanism is only warrantied for a year, so apparently Bowflex only had so much faith in the product as well. I subsequently purchased a set of PowerBlocks off Craigslist and am completely satisfied. They're durable, heavy, and backed by a ten year warranty. I would recommend them to anyone. They're also less expensive new."
3,Very good product,"Well made, very clever design. All in all recommended - they are bulky though - you may find it difficult to do your workout just as if you were using gym dumbbells."
5,Great Product,"I've only had Select-Tech Dumbbells a week, so I can't comment on their longevity or how they hold up to repeated workouts, only my initial impressions.So far, I am very pleased with how they feel when doing every type of dumbbell exercise. Due to the mechanism that holds the plates in place, using a lighter weight still requires the overall length of the dumbbell to be the same. Because of that, I was expecting an awkward feel, but that is not the case. My wife uses 5 - 12.5 pound settings and the extra length is a non-factor for her as well. We also have a small workout room, so the space saving benefit is a plus.As advertised, just turn the dial and select your weight. It's that easy. I have found myself doing proper sets now, where before I didn't want to hassle with changing plates. It also speeds up the workout.They are expensive, but worth the money if you plan on sticking to a routine."
2,They break,"They are good space saving dumbells. I have had mine for 5 months and already both of them have broke. If you drop them when there is a lot of weight on them, like say 50lbs. at the wrong angle, they will brake. The little discs that are connected to the handle part that hold the plates on will snap off like a graham cracker. I completely forgot to send in the warranty registration when I got them, so I am screwed. If you must have these, and dont work out until failure, and set them down gently everytime you use them, theyre for you."
1,Wish I could give 0 stars,"I was excited to receive these, but within 6 months they were not working well. They do not always pick up all the weights that I adjust them for and occasionally some of the weights slip out after I pick them up. These have been a complete disappointment. I understand, from a personal trainer friend, that the only benefit of these is the brand name - there are a couple of non-Bowflex products that are very similar, cost less and perform better. My discussions with Bowflex for customer service have been completely unproductive. If I could rate these as a zero, I would happily do so."
1,Very gentle and it still broke,"Just like everyone else is saying, THEY BREAK FAST! Hardly used them and I was just as delicate as could be. One was loose when it was delivered and soon it started dropping plates from the dumbbell onto my wood floor and nearly took off my big toe. Quality is so poor, these look like class action lawsuit material."
5,Every expectation met,"Delivery was rapid (ahead of scheduled delivery time) , the item was brand new and came as advertised. The price was outstanding compared to alternative purchase sites and I would highly recommend."
3,Decent,"Good product overall. There are better ones out there like Powerblock. The good is the space issue. The bad is that I had one break, the collar on the bar broke. The collar held one of the weights in place so the weight fell and could have caused serious damage. The good is that Nautilus is great about fixing issues, and they sent me a new bar within a month."
4,Pretty Good...,"As with most reviews, there are already tons of folks on here that have broken this item down peice by piece in their reviews. To save time, I'll just say that this is a good set of dumbbells. You can do all your curling and chest fly's etc. with these bad boys. Perfect if you can't get to the gym and want to avoid that ""weak"" feeling you get after you miss a couple days of gym time. My only complaint is that I out grew them, and now I can only use the 52.5 pound waits for toning, but then again I'm a power lifter, so I guess out-growing them is a good thing. All in all a good product, just wish they made bigger sets for the same price lol."
1,Bowflex will not back these,"After only a year of normal use, the weights will fall off. the chintzy plastic pins that should be keeping the dials from turning wore out and the weights fell on my wife's toe while she was using them. Bowflex is copping out, leaving me to try to fix these. Buy something else."
2,The SIMPLE truth about adjustable dumbbells.,"You can get all the weight ranges offered by the SelecTech dumbbells by getting a pair of handles, 8 10-lb, 4 5-lb and 2 2.5-lb plates (add 2 1.25-lb plates if you need 2.5-lb increments). You can store all of this in a milk crate that takes up the same amount of space as the SelecTechs and weighs the same amount. The whole thing will cost you under $[...].If you are willing to pay $[...] to avoid having to change plate weights a few times per workout, then there's no hope for you anyway. Go ahead and buy these cheaply made and overpriced pieces of crap."
1,No Item received,I ordered this equipment on December 20th and was told to expect a 3 days delivery. The equipment never showed up. I sent a reply to the seller and was told that the equipment would be shipped (3 times!). One month later the equipment was never shipped. This was the worse experience I have had with an on-line purchase.
4,"Worth the money, but has a few downsides","Overall, a great product. My only concern is when I do certain lifts and the dumbells rub against my body because they are so wide. Good quality and very durable."
2,Works Great for about 4 months,"This is a good product for about 4 months until it falls apart. Everyone i know who has this says the same thing. Your better off just buying dumbells, this product is nice because all in one, but its fairly dangerous. Many times the weights have come apart while ive been lifting. They feel cheap and clunky. However for an all in one weightlifting device its decent. Major improvements need to be made to make it safer though or they will be seeing some law suits in the future."
4,Not so Dumb...,"After years of using traditional dumbbells, I thought these new Bowflex SelectTech might offer me some good home training during the Winter months. So far, after a month's time ~ I have had several good workouts with these dumbbells. They are a little bigger than my traditional set, but the easy grip handles and the fast and easy weight change system makes these a lot more 'user-friendly' overall. The optional stand and bench are on my wish list for later, too."
1,"If you're so inclined, read this:","Secondly, obviously Mormons were prone enough to have Harold B. Lee state the following:""It never ceases to amaze me how gullible many of our Church members are in broadcasting sensational stories, or dreams, or visions, or purported patriarchal blessings.....we find that these spurious writings and some of these purported revelations, which we found upon investigation are absolutely false, are finding their way into our Relief Society meetings, into priesthood quorums, firesides, institutes, and seminaries.""(""To the Defenders of the Faith."" the Improvement Era, no. 6(June 1970): 64)."
2,BE CAREFUL ON THIS ONE!,WHOEVER GAVE THIS CD 5 STARS WAS DEAF! THESE ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS AND IT EVEN SAYS SO ON THE CD CASE BACK. MY TAKE IS THAT ALL OF THE ORIGINAL VOCALISTS ARE NOT ON ANY OF THE SONGS AT THE SAME TIME. I AM NOT FROM THIS ERA OF MUSIC BUT I HAVE HEARD THE SONGS ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THESE ARE NOT THE SONGS WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO. I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT AMAZON DOES NOT GIVE US A DISCLAIMER ABOUT RE-RECORDED CD'S THAT ARE PRESENTED AS ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. IN THE STORE WE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BUY THEM.....
2,Not relevant anymore,"What we know about AIDS today dwarf what was known some 20 years ago. As a result, any movie (documentary or fictional) that deals with the disease quickly becomes dated (and irrelevant) as new information becomes available. ""Sex Is""is no exception. Still, some of the interviewees, namely Lulu, Madame X and Bambi Lake provide enjoyable entertainment. The rest of the 'cast' are either nondescript or downright pretentious and annoying."
2,"A bland, fangless sequel","Ethan Hawke returns for a mute cameo before passing on the lead role to an unknown actor in this pointless film. Henry Casey is looking after Jack's claim and White Fang after Jack finally moves to San Francisco. He meets a native girl who convinces him to search for Caribou. And...that's it when it comes to plot.It's very, very slow and doesn't really build up to much. There are still some lovely views and scenery but the scope is lost, and even White Fang himself has a diminished presence and function.Overall White Fang 2 feels and looks a lot like a Disney Channel TV and not like a theatrical movie. Nothing to do with Jack London either, so I can't really recommend it to any particular fanbase the first might have had."
5,Great movie!,I have loved this movie since I was a kid. It was just as I remembered and was very pleased.
2,A little to lovey-dovey,"White Fang-- Story about a wolf dog taken from the north, trained to be sled dog, goes into fighting rings, finds loveWhite Fang2: Myth of the White Wolf-- Movie about the master of White Fang, and an indian girl. White Fang is around a little.White Fang2 had little to nothing about our all time favorite wolf-dog White Fang. It is mainly about his master, falling in love. I kept waiting for at least one scene with White Fang! The first movie was more like it.This was a little boring, I don't really recommend it unless you like a lot of boring flirty romance, and little wolf."
3,Disney made this up.,"I've read White fang and there is no mention of Myth of a White Wolf. Disney had to have a sequel, so they made up this story."
5,Give this to every Cancer patient you know!,"When my sister was diagnosed with cancer I sent her just about every book I could find on cancer survival, inspiration and the like. But when I stumbled onto this set, 2 tapes and a book, without listening or reading it, I sent it on. One week later she called me and told me that this set had helped her more than any other single book or tape out there. Most importantly it helped her deal with her fear, set her priorities for healing strategies in order, gave her a concrete meditation for invisioning the actual immune system, and discussed indentifing her passions and dreams, as they would help her survive, and much more. She followed the advice absolutly, started horse back riding again (her passion) and lived another 8 years, when she had been told only 6 months. Thankyou Dr. Simmington, for the quality time you gave my family, and the peace you gave my sister."
4,A Beautiful Book,"This book is beautifully arranged, and has some amazing black and white engravings from Kukpa's work for various publishers."
1,UNHAPPY CUSTOMER,"I have never received my package of Mach 3 blades for which I was charged. When I contacted the supplier. they assured me that they had shipped the item. I was given the choice of receiving a credit or an expedited shipment. I requested that they reship the item. I was provided with an internet tracking number which, when contacted, assured me that the item had been shipped and delivered. This is my first truly negative experience with an Amazon ordered item. I still have not received the promised item nor have I received credit for it.Please take the necessary action to give me credit for an item which I have never receivedRalph Shapiro rshapiro002@socal.rr.com 310-809-9467Gillette Mach 3 Refills - 12 Cartridges (Purchased on 03/11/2008)by Gillette"
4,great kit for Mazda Miata,"I bought this item for my 94 mazda miata, there were other kits that looked simpler and less complicated but they were too generic. I decided on this becuase of the brand I have installed many ohter radios with the Metra kits and always had great results.for my particular car there is some prep work to be done, you have to build the case before adding your radio but with patience and careful reading the instructions really do a good job at showing you the right steps.Once the kits is ready and you have done your prep work with the radio harness its just a plug and play install.I am very happy with the results and as wellwith the versatility of options with this kit."
3,Not so good fit for 1995 Miata,"This item is not perfect fit for my 1995 Miata. After cutting a lot of useless mounting stuff of the unit, I had to further modify the length of the front panel. I needed matel saw to cut the 2mm thick pastic plates about 200mm long. It was a lot of modification work. In addition, I needed a lot of work to cut the rough edges of all the pastic material."
1,Product did not fit my 1995 Mazda Miata,"This product does not fit into a 1995 Mazda Miata. Fortunately, I only really wanted it to fill in the huge space below the radio, so I only used a small piece of the product, and I ended up damaging the piece I did use since the tabs are so thick. It is easy to break the brackets since the tabs are real thick and hard to work with. You also need to grind off the edges since they leave jagged edges."
3,Difficult Fit for 97 Miata M ed.,"Unfortunately being a unit designed for multiple vehicles, a lot of cutting, filing and mods needed to be done. The Miata does not allow for any side entry, so all has to be done prior to installation through the front opening. Once the kit was modified to fit the radio, it would not go into the opening. The opening on the dash/console had to be cut and changed quite a bit to accept the assembly. I think a metal kit would be better, as the plastic is flimsy and distorts easily when inserting. Set aside nearly a day for this installation, in this application."
3,s4 rx7,Kind of worked for my s4 rx-7. I ended up having to glue the tray and spacer together to get it to fit snug. Also had to drill out a slot to work with the stock stereo bracket.
4,Totally swoony!,"I bought this CD with only having heard the music for one of them (Breakfast), but I was so completely surprised with the quality of the espionage-spy thriller 'Arabesque'. It's a truly excellant score. I had heard of the film but had no notion of what the music was like. 'Breakfast' is indeed a classic score and tracks such as 'Moon River', 'Something for the Cat' and 'Holly' are its highlights. But if you are to compare it with 'Arabesque' in seems to come up short on variation, orchestration, imagination and scope. 'Breakfast' seems to be TOO easy listening, with 'Arabasque' proving a far more satisfying experience. Now all I have to do is watch the film!"
4,Better Than Season 7 in My Opinion,"Seasons 1 through 6 were totally classic and on point. Nothing will every compare to the earlier seasons. With any show, you can pretty much expect it to decline with time. However, season seven was a big disappointment for me. It really lacked originality and the fun factor seemed to be lost in every episode. But, season eight semi-redeems itself. I actually found season eight to be funnier than season seven. Of course the magic of the earlier seasons is completely gone, but this show is a classic nonetheless. Add this to your collection & i cant wait for the final 11th season to debut on DVD."
5,"""Let's Rock.""","I'm one of the many individuals who absolutely believe that ""Married...with Children"" is one of the finest sitcoms ever to be televised. Sure the humor is almost always crude, but that's what makes it so good. The Bundys are absolutely hilarious. Al's shattered dreams and Peggy's stupendous carelessness are the highlights for almost every episode. Kelly's low intelligence and Bud's failed love life completes the dysfunctional family. And let's not forget their neighbors: the chicken-legged Marcy, and the charming but unemployed Jefferson, and (from the earlier seasons) the one-and-only Steve.The Bundys will be remembered for all eternity! At least I hope they will be..."
1,THE END,"This was when the show transformed from excellent comedy to a silly cartoon.....GONE was the edge from earlier seasons.....GONE was nastiness and vulgarity from earlier seasons...The show started to decline big time in season 7 and season 8 is only worse...The following seasons are unwatchable....The show's best seasons (1-4) it was a sharp edged nasty groundbreaking sitcom....At this stage it become a goofy silly slapstick embarrassment..One of the shows creators (Ron Leavitt) left after season 6 and he is SORELY MISSED.....No Maam was stupid...Could have been priceless having Al and a bunch of his loser friends together but instead it turns into a goof fest...Al Bundy basically turned into a live action Homer Simpson....So if you like silly, goofy, slapstick then this season is for you....If you prefer the edginess then check out seasons 1 thru 5.....PERFECT EXAMPLE of how a once great show can decline if it stays on the air too long"
4,Season when MWC begins to get bad,"I'm an MWC fanatic and I absolutely love the first 7 seasons but this season is when things start to get bad - with the introduction of No Ma'am and all those other weird storylines (Jefferson being a spy, Grim Reaper comes over.)The only 5 good episodes here are 1) St. Valentine's Day Massacre (Kelly forgets to give Bud a valentine from a girl and he goes to her hotel to try to get some. 2) Proud to Be Your Bud (Bud goes nuts and his cool alter-ego tries to take over his body) 3) No Chicken, No Check (the kids buy a car and have to share) 4) Ride Scare (Al carpools with 3 fat chicks) 5) Kelly Knows something (Kelly goes on a sports gameshow but every fact she learns replaces something else in her brain. )The St. Valentine's Day episode may be worth the price of this season alone. Bud: ""You have 5 seconds to announce me. "" Sasquatch: ""It's Buuuud Bundy! """
1,married with children eight seasona ripoff. some of the original actors are mis,a ripoff. some of the original actors have been replaced with inept actors. this will probably result in my not purchasing any videos from amazon in the future
3,"Good, but not as good as previous seasons","I love ""Married With Children"" and recently bought seasons 5-8. This season is good, but not as good as previous ones. The main difference is that while previous seasons were based on clever dialogs this season is based mainly on situational humor which is less funny and much more predictable. On the other hand you do have the first episode with NO MAAM which is a big plus..."
5,gets better with age,"the show continued to excel in off the wall episodes. So very funny and you just ever get tired of watching all seasons, except season 1. But after that all remaining seasons just got better and better.Reality TV sucks, comic, slapstick is a get ""tired of reality crap"". Married with Childeren is a great escape from the drearyness of reality."
4,"Good, but...","I listened to this one again the other day, and it holds up.This is from the period where everyone was accusing the Wokers of seeking ""crossover"" success, trying to get out of the garage scene and grab some of that Red Hot Chili Peppers money all the labels were busy ruining rock with. And no, that doesn't mean this sounds anything like the RHCP. This sounds like the Miracle Workers, growing up and trying to fit in. Not at all a bad thing on ""Rock and Roll Revolution in the Streets Part 1"", ""Fool"", ""Burn Baby Burn"", or ""Untitled"". It's just that I never got into ""Kindred Soul"" too much, and ""Magic Slide"" is STUPID. Don't know why. Just didn't like 'em. So four stars.But somebody PLEASE find out who owns the rights to reproduce their Overdose album (which I only ever saw on Life's Simple Dreams records, from Germany I think) and get it OUT! I'm sick of humming ""Just Can't Find a Better Way to Waste Your Time"" and ""She's Got a Patron Saint"" in my head.It's for the Kids, dammit."
1,Deliverance? From What!,"On my audio receiver I have a music enhancement button. One of the enhancements is ""Music Hall"". Music Hall kicks the treble up by several notches and adds reverb (read echo). The Music Hall was turned on from the beginning to the end of this album.There is not one song on this album that the world ""needs"". There is nothing new or compelling on this album. Just more of the same old- same old.It has been noted that Jonathan Butler has a reputation as a first rate guitar player. There is nothing on this album to reinforce this opinion.Sorry, but this album sounds like lame elevator music to my ears."
4,Lots of great pictures,"The book isn't very long and contains very few pages with actual words on it, but I didn't buy it for a story, I bought it for pictures of Madonna. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was made near the end of 1987, so it only has pictures and information on Madonna from 1982-87. In the back portion of the book it does however have a short year by year biography on her. The pictures are black and white or colored. Many of them are from her different concerts. The book also includes some information on the earlier movies Madonna starred in such as Who's That Girl? and Shanghi Surprise. There are alot better books on Madonna that you could get, but for the price this is a great book. The pictures are beautiful and it is a welcome addition to my Madonna collection."
5,THE SAMOANS ARE THE BEST YOU WILL OBAY THE SAMOANS OR DIE,"IN THIS REPORTERS OPINION NO ONE QUITE SETS IT OFF LIKE METAL MIKE FROM THIS SO CAL BEACH BAND DOES. IF YOU HAVE JUST 1/4 OF YOUR BRAIN LEFT YOU WILL COME TO REALIZE THIS 4 PIECE BAND IS OUT OF THEIR MINDS BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME TRAPPED INSIDE. SO GO AHEAD AND SPICE YOUR LIFE.THROW AWAY YOUR RICKY MARTIN AND BRITTNEY SPEARS C.D'S LISTEN TO THE FURY WHICH IS THE SAMOANS,AND DONT FORGET TO FEED THE CATS MOM WONT BE HOME TILL 10:00 pm"
3,Difficult to learn from.,"As someone who came to this book with some exposure to analysis, multivariate calculus, and topology, I found it really difficult to learn from this book. I knew absolutely nothing about differential topology when starting, and cannot say I know much more now. The chapters on manifolds and submanifolds were easy enough to understand, but starting with the chapters tangent spaces and critical points, and critical and noncritical levels I just became lost. The big picture overviews given at the beginning of sections were somewhat helpful, but all in all I think I came away with very little from reading this book, considering the amount of effort I put into reading it. I found the book Introduction to Manifolds by Loring Tu to be much much better, although I've been told that it looks at things from more of a differential geometry point of view."
2,Bonsai planter,A little too pricey althought I didprefer an authentic-looking bonsaiplanter.Does not sit level.The bottomis warped somehow.Probably fired toorapidly or not cooled properly.I'lllive with it.
2,Hurt Me is the Only Song I like,"Bought this old school Euro-pop 80s cd from the Fox for just one song, her Hurt Me Hurt me song. It is so dated and so 80s. Full Force produced this track and it is still fun listnening to it. Eyebrow raising and finger popping fun!"
3,She co-wrote a few of her own here,"When Samantha Fox pens a song she sure knows how to make you feel it. ""Nothing You Do, Nothing You Say"" is the best track here along with a few others, ""Another Woman"", ""Just One Night"", ""Pleasure Zone"", and ""Spirit of America."" Check out her I Wanna Have Some Fun cd she co-wrote another great song named ""Confession."""
2,hurt me! hurt me!,"though samantha fox broke onto the scene as a cross between lita ford and kylie minogue (that would be early kylie, before she flitted off to japan and reinvented herself and the diva du jour of the ultra-hip queer clique), _just one night_ finds her attempting to expand her audience base into the urban genre. with production and songwriting by full force and c+c music factory, and back-up vocals by full force proteges and powerhouse vocalists cheryl ""pepsii"" riley and ex-girlfriend, fox does successfully transition from a pop/rock to a pop/r&b vein, but it proves to be too little, too late. with the exception of the lead track, ""(hurt me! hurt me!) but the pants stay on"", which is a stand-out sheerly because it's such a novelty song, the material on _just one night_ sounds like b-sides from more talented artists of the day, like milli vanilli, new choice, seduction and pebbles."
5,all time classic sam,"i buy this cd recently!wow!!amazing sound,amazing songs and samantha gave us her best in this alboum.i recomend it!!!!it worth it!"
1,NOT BENEFICIAL,"This video is much too easy and not beneficial enough to be called a power sculpting with resistance pilates. I have done many pilates videos as well as classes and do know what a pilates workout is supposed to feel like during and after the exercises and this Winsor Pilates is completely useless. Do not waste your money, but instead purchase some of the power yoga dvd's from Rodney Yee. They are fantastic."
2,Waste of money,"I love pilates, I love Yoga and I was always curios about Winsor Pilates. I find it boring, I never saw results, and maybe it is just not my style.Think twice before you buy it"
4,Just as honest as the day is long. A must read!,"True, trashy and terrific! A must read for those who lovea juicy plot and a love-hate relationship."
4,"Read it ""Tonight""!","This is a must-read for any Leno and Letterman fan who wants the inside scoop on exactly what went on behind the screens during the fight over ""The Tonight Show"". It is easy to follow and it mentions all the key players.As I'm in the UK, and we only got the Letterman and Leno shows in 1994, it details everything that happened that we didn't already know.The only distracting thing about the book is that it swings Letterman's way. As it is a couple of years old now, the last chapter (Carter's own feelings on the matter) doesn't ring entirely true.It is, however, an entertaining and insightful book giving a great view of network politics and contracts."
2,Read only if you want to learn every intricate detail,"The movie was mildly entertaining, so I decided to check the book out. However, I found myself losing interest in the book quite fast.The ending result is anti-climatic, of course, since we all know the result of the late-night battle.The behind the scenes details weren't all that compelling. Just a bunch of head strong, egotistical executives fighting over who they thought deserved Carson's seat as the King of Latenight.The only insightful part of the book to me was learning how Conan O'brien has won the Late Night show. I had always wondered how such a relative unknown had won the part."
3,NBC SCREWS LETTERMAN,I am a huge Letterman fan and thought Bill Carter spent too much time in this book focusing on Jay Leno.Ive re-read it a couple of times and came up with the same conclusion.The book was far better than that rediculous movie.
5,A remarkable achievement,"Bill Carter has written an extraordinary book.Structurally-given the mass of information,biographical detail and anecdotes involved-this could have ended up as a mess,but in fact it is clear,coherent and quite exceptionally well-balanced.Carter has to tell a fairly complicated (certainly very convoluted)story,and he does so brilliantly.He also has to find space to acknowledge and evaluate a broad range of opinions,and,again,he does so with remarkable discipline and even-handedness.Even if one knows little about the magnificent Letterman and the super-professional Leno,this book is still too interesting,too insightful and too fair-minded to miss."
2,Interesting subject matter but insufferable writing,"The actual story behind this book is interesting, and it's nice to get a chance to examine the personalities of Jay Lenoand David Letterman, but Bill Carter's writing is unbearably bad. This book has all the style of a bad true crime book. The story kept me involved, but the writing was very irritating. (Especially terrible was the repeated use of the word ""coronated"".)"
3,"Eloquent, masterly essays.","A recapitulation of Schopenhauer's key ideas, such as the vanity of earthly existence and the suffering in the world, along with some engrossing sections on suicide, religion and psychology. The notorious essay on women, I must say, contains some hilarious views which some may now find backward but - (and I dare say this!) - I found myself perfectly in agreement with Schopenhauer with regards to the character of the weaker sex. Otherwise the wit, the erudition, the breadth of scope, are all the marks of a truly great mind and an undisputed master of prose style. I wouldn't recommend this abridged version, though, since it grubbily truncates the essays and the final effect is altogether diluted. However, if one can't get hold of the unabridged one, this edition is an entertaining enough read and deserves a glance."
3,Schopenhauer Light,"This little easy-to-read book is an excellent introduction to Schopenhauer's thought, but it is not as satisfying as his more ambitious philosophical works. Contains essays on religion, suicide and women among othe things. A good background for studing Nietzsche."

5,schopenhauer rules!!!!,"i picked this little volume up when i was 28 years old, and have yet to find anything in my life experience to contradict it. the section on women is right on the mark, though in our emasculated age it is the truth we dare not speak. a friend, upon picking up the book and reading the first paragraph, remarked, 'i dont want to read anything depressing, no matter how true it is'. a wonderful editing and translation, this volume inspired me to read both volumes of 'the world as...', yet i found there nothing substantially new. this book is the essential schopenhauer, one of the few, true geniuses."
4,AS shown in pic.,It is nice and sleek watch.. it looks exactly same as shown in picture.. You have to get the few chains removed to get it fit for small hands...
3,BRAINIAC IS WHACK!!!,"THIS DVD IS OK!!! AT THE SAME TIME ITS KINDA CORNY!!! LEX LUTHER IS PLAYED BY A DIFFERENT ACTOR OTHER THAN THE GUY FROM THE SUPERMAN ANIMATED SERIES AND HE IS CORNY AS FREAKIN HEC! THE STORY LINE IS KINDA OFF FROM THE THINGS WE KNOW ALREADY FROM THE SUPERMAN ANIMATED SERIES. IN THE ORIGINAL COMICS BRAINIAC IS NOT FROM KRYPTON!! THE FIGHTING SCENES ARE OK. IF U ARE A COLLECTOR THEN GET IT, IF NOT BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!"
5,how to ship,i really want to buy this product bad and i don't get how to ship because i want to get this rite but amazon sucks at shipping now. last time they didn't get my package delivered.
1,Avoid like the plague,"DO NOT spend any hard earned money on this product. Wait and go see Superman Returns an extra time if you just have to have a Superman fix. Luthor and Brainiac are not only horribly voiced but WAY out of character. Would have only been a 30 minute cartoon if not for the totally out of proportion fights. Really, stay away. Your time and money are worth more than this."
2,brainiac attacks... my wallet for $15!!!,"as usual, great action & superman is the man. but, luthor is way too goofy compared to the series & brainiac actually has emotions, which takes away from his appealing detachment. probably why lex or brainy's voices had to be recasted. Stll like Powers Boothe anyway.this is coming from a long time comic & cartoon fan, you guys can do better."
1,"Call it ""Super-Duper Man""","Yeah, call it ""Super-Duper Man"" because the story, the animation, and most of the voicework is on par with something only a 3 year-old could watch and be entertained.All the reviews you've read here (and I haven't found a single positive one yet) . . . believe them!!! STAS was one of the best animated shows around. This garbage is insulting to think of it as being related in any way whatsoever to STAS.Warner Brothers, the production company, the animators, and the horrible writers should be ashamed to put their names on this. Do yourself a favor - watch an episode of Scrappy-Doo. Even that puts this to shame."
1,Kicking a good man...,"Not to jump on the band-wagon here, but I would have to agree with the other reviewers. Had I purchased this instead of waiting for the ""free view"" on Cartoon Network I would be of all men, most miserable. I absolutely love Batman, Batman Beyond, Superman and Justice League and this production was a huge disappointment. The Luthor and Braniac voices were awful...the story was weak...buy the second season of Justice League instead."
1,Do NOT Buy This Movie,"I honestly couldn't watch more than fifteen minutes of this train wreck. The writing is terrible to the point of nausea, and Lex, Lois, and Braniac are so far out of their established characters that it isn't funny. And I mean that literally, since the writer seems to be trying to play them for laughs.Had I seen this on Cartoon Network before purchasing it (I'd pre-ordered it the day I'd heard about it, months ago, based on the strength of the original series and Justice League), I'd have never wasted my money."
1,a Pokeman Lex Luthor,I love the Superman and Batman Animated Series. They are well written and geared for adult fans also. This movie is horrible! Lex Luthor acts like he should be on Pokeman! (and I HATE anything that has to do with Pokeman!). Neurotic and moronic! Powers Boothe is the voice for Lex instead of Clancy Brown. Powers needs to stay in Deadwood and NOT in Metropolis (if you know what I mean)! Do not buy this movie! Dont even watch it on TV for free!
1,Not up to standard,"This is very much a child's dvd. It has nothing to do with previous Warner Animation series starring Superman. It is not from the Paul Dini team, and isn't going to hold the interest of anyone over the age of 7. Buy it for the kids, just don't watch it with them."
3,Not THAT Bad,"I read all the negative reviews before I watched this, so I was expecting a really horrible movie. However, I enjoyed this movie, and so did my son. I've only seen a few episodes of Superman:TAS, though. Maybe if I'd watched more of that show it would've affected this review. Who knows?I do know that Lex Luthor was way out of character, but even so he was fun to watch. I loved Jimmy's crush on Mercy, and the ultimate resolution of it. The fights were decent. Tim Daley and Dana Delaney are awesome as Superman and Lois.I'd recommend this for someone who wants to watch a good, fun Superman movie with their small children, like I did."
1,What a dishonor to the Superman animated series,"Storyline: I am surprise this disgrace of animated was made as a movie. It had no real storyline at all. They also stab fans of superman by teasing them with a romantic relationship of Lois and Clark/Superman. But guess what it doesn't happen and they go no where. After being married in comices over 10 years they get it right on animated side.Characters: God Awful. They totally blew with Lex Luthor with terrible voice acting and lines. Other than Superman and Lois, the rest of the cast were totally cheezy.Animation: Almost like the series but pretty bad in certain parts of the movie.Redeeming factor: NoneIt is worth watching even on a rental: Nope. Save the money."
1,New Animated Movie - New Insult to Your Taste,"Tim Daly returns as the voice of Clark/Superman--the only good news for this entire movie. The loss of Clancy for Lex Luthor was bad enough, but to make him a campy comic relief that's not worthy of a 6 year old's sense of humor adds insult to injury. DO NOT BUY THIS! I wouldn't even rent it. If Curt Geda has any sense at all, he'd drop this new line/direction they're trying to take Superman Animated and stick with what worked. They haven't targeted a fickle kid audience, so give up on the changes and for the love of god, look back at what you've done and at least bring back the theme music used before!!!! Curt Geda, if you ever see these reviews, this was the greatest disappontment I've ever experienced in the Superman genre."
2,Rent this before you buy it,"This was very disappointing. I've followed the previous animated series over the years and enjoyed the rich continuity developed within them. This animated movie fairly ignores previous continuity and creates a whole new reality of its own. I'll agree with many other reviewers about the negatives on this movie, so I'll say simply this. Before you buy this movie (even to get the free movie pass), rent it and decide for yourself. I spent the full price and was very disappointed. See what you think for yourself."
1,WORST DC ANIMATED MOVIE EVER,"This is for sure the WORST DC animated movie ever released. How can they take the designs from Superman The Animated Series to make this movie is a complete lack of respect for that animated series. This movie is not worth it in any sense at all. The voices, the acting, the plot, the fights. The list could go on and on. This movie was made to get more cash because Superman returns. Thats the ONLY reason they would dare to produce this pile of crap. What a letdown. After so much years waiting for a Superman Animated movie they come up with this. Dont spend your money on this, it doesnt deserve it AT ALL. Get Superman The Animated Series Volumes 1, 2 or 3 instead. Or you can go big time with JUSTICE LEAGUE SEASON 2, coming out along with this nonse sense movie."
1,Sperman-Braniac Attacks,"What bothered me most about Superman: Brainiac Attacks, was the character of Lex Luther, the portrayal of him was a JOKE! I almost think that this Lex Luther was based on Mark Hamill's version of the Joker from Batman: The Animated Series and The Justice League. I could have lived with the different voices and the bad animation, but Lex Luther completely ruined it for me.I'm so lucky that I got a free viewing of this movie on the Cartoon Network, it would have been a complete waste of my hard earned cash to have purchased this DVD."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Voice of Lex, Mercy, Braniac we're different. Dialogue was campy and uninteresting. Sound effects were not same or as high quality as the series. AND THE STORY WASN'T WORTH MY TIME MUCH LESS MY MONEY. How can the creators of such a great series put out such TRASH!"
1,Not even finished wtaching it...,"Unbelievable, I'm about 2 minutes in and I already hate it. Was Clancy Brown too busy taping his useless Lost cameos to voice Luthor? As a fan of JLU, my first thoughts were ""Why is Lex voiced by Grodd?"" It reminded me of a Krypto episode, which might be fine for kids, but even this was nauseatingly worse than that show. The DVD...(Wait, I'm shutting it off, I might throw up too)... Should have had a disclaimer- Not for fans of Superman: The Animated Series or the Man of Steel himslef!!My two year old cousin is a Superman fan (Or Soopid-Man, as he calls him. And Spider-Man for that matter. We'll work on that)and I would feel bad giving this to him.Anyway, I'll use it as a coaster or something.The lithograph that it came with was cool anyway.Sorry Bruce Timm, your work really deserved better."
1,Just simply terrible -- a waste of money,"I see a reviewer said:""Quite possibly the single worst animated film of all time""All I can say is, he liked it a LOT more than I did!!!Tim Daly is back as Superman, and that's all the good news there is.It doesn't look like any of the creative team behind the real shows worked on this mess at all.Even the opening titles are an embarrassment. They don't even use the theme song. Luthor, Brainiac, Mercy, and (I think) Perry have had voice replacements, and lousy ones. Luthor is a (badly animated) buffoon. The big fights are idiotic; Superman smashes the Braniac robot into skyscrapers all over Metropolis, clearly killing hundreds of people in the process.And it has really really really really long slow end credits, apparently to pad out it's meager running time."
1,Awful,"If you've ever watched and enjoyed Superman in any animated form, stay away from this embarassment! I heard negative buzz before I watched this, but I kept an open mind thinking ""It can't be as bad as they're saying. Probably just the fan-boys whining."" After watching Brianiac Attacks, I can say honestly say that ""It IS that bad"". I could write pages on its shortcomings, but there wouldn't be much point. If you really need a Superman fix, buy Superman I or II, the Animated Series, Justice League or Smallville. Whatever you do, just don't go within 100 miles of Brianiac Attacks."
5,Very enjoyable digital camera,"You guys convinced me to get this camera last week, and I'm very happy with it. There are so many features that they will please everyone in the family, from kids to pro wannabe's. It's image quality is superb! I compared with Canon and Sony and while those were also *great* cameras, they don't offer as much value and ""fun factor"" as the F300, so I think I made a totally right choice. I also want to thank Minolta for choosing the 2 AA battery path; it really saves a lot of money down the road because prop Li-ion batteries are real costly, and they die after 8-14 months.IN a nutshell, this is a highly enjoyable camera. No more film photography for me!"
3,"Great features, fussy focusing, so-so pictures","I recently purchased this camera, took it out for a few detailed 'spins', and -- discouraged -- am sending it back. While I'm aware that I could have taken advantage of the bevy of manual controls to improve the look of my photographs, I was disheartened to see average-to-poor results from shooting in the default ""Auto"" mode, particularly when shooting at 5MP in dimly lit situations. Admittedly, these sort of circumstances are pushing the limits for any compact-or-smaller digicams, but I still expected better from the F300. For more details, reviews, and sample galleries, I encourage you to check out Epinions, MinoltaF300, and other dotcom sites that offer rich perspectives on the F300. I just wish I had bought this camera direct from Amazon -- then I wouldn't be having so many problems in trying to send it back :-("
1,Electronics fan,"I bought and owned this camera for 3 days had to send it back defective! Battery problems I took 14 pictures and the NiMh were dead so the camera said! Recharged the battries installed them turned on camera it started but then died the green indicator lamp came on flashing LED battery icon reads full but camera will not turn on, installed new fresh NiMh batterys same problem called Minolta twice they said send it in to be repaired, no it will go back to Ritz camera for a full refund hopefully? The pictures I took were not impressive, beware this camrera sucks-up batterys, Minolta sends u 5 batterys knowing it uses up batterys! I think there is a issue with batterys on this camera but Minolta will not admit it? I have 2 other dig camera Sony&Minolta I will buy another Sony 5 meg pix camera if I get my refund back? Beware of this camera, battery issue, I know all dig camera use up batterys but not like this one, good luck!"
3,batteries get sucked up quick,"this is a a good camera for the price and takes great pictures, however it will drain batteries super fast. I can only get about 5 pictures out before the batteries are drained. I would suggest buying a different camera. I have spent over $100.00 in just batteries and I have used the camera less than 5 hours. I have owned it for about 7 months but I can not depend on it."
1,What a headache! 1 Star is being kind!,"I've spent 5-6 hours trying to get my computer to recognize the camera but it won't. I have Windows XP Home Edition 5.1 and when the software installs, it can't find the driver which Minolta supplied for the original operating system, or the one that appears on the CD. I should clarify to say that the software doesn't recognize their own drivers, as they are on the CD and my hard drive for me to recognize. Tech support for Emachines, Microsoft and Minolta have each been thoroughly useless and passed me along. I'm ready to return the camera!"
5,AutoCAD 2000 VBA : A programmers Reference,"I have only recently delved into the further workings of AutoCAD 2000 and thought I'd try my hand at VBA Programming. So I bought this book. As an beginner to programming in general (though not to VB6) I thought the book would be a little above my experience.......WRONG!! This book is an excellent publication for beginner to intermediate users. If, as a VBA programmer, you can't find anything useful in this book then maybe you need to consider your career..........Absolutely outstanding"
4,Prayer of Jesus,anyone who is serious about their prayer life would benefit greatly from this book.Hanegraaff expounded on the Lords prayer with clarity.
3,A Sweet Book with Gold Nuggets for the Believer,"If you are looking for a scholarly study of the Lord's Prayer, this is not the book for you. This is a collection of folksy stories, tender insights, and pithy sayings. The vignettes are sweet and heart warming. The insights are clear and true. The sayings (I have highlighted them)are memorable.But the book doesn't explore the grandeur, power, and fullness of the Lord's Prayer as I hoped. I ended up knowing more about Hank but not much more about Jesus.But for the nuggets alone, it was worth the reading time:""The secret to prayer is secret prayer.""and""At present we are sandwhiched between the triumph of the cross and the termination of time - between D-Day and V-Day.""and""The tragedy is not in dying young, but in living large and never using your life for eternal significance.""These are precious gems and I appreciate the kindness, humility, and tenderness he expresses; that much at least, is certainly like Christ."
5,Got an awesome deal!,"This went on sale on Amazon just before Christmas. With the five dollar off polly coupon that automatically applies until the end of the year, it was very cheap. When I got it, I wished I had ordered more. It looks like lots of fun. The guitar seems like the barney guitar that plays preset tunes. However, there are little makeup compartments all over for your little princess. It looks like it could be lots and lots of fun. I think this is a good one for the right price. I don't think I would pay full price, though."
1,tore after 3 uses,I bought 3 sets of this. My son destroyed two in a month- the pants tore while he was trying to put them on. It is inexpensive- but still a waste of money!
2,One Person's Cup of Tea is Another's .....,"This is another book by an ex-Roman Catholic who feels it her duty to preach the Gospel to Roman Catholics, like they have never heard it. The author claims to have been a novice Sister, and absolutely refuses to identify the Religious Community of which she was a former member---so this is already suspect as far as I am concerned. Could it be she was considered intractable and was thrown out of this unnamed Community, and now has a ""beef"" with the entire Roman Church? At any rate, the book is well researched, and typically expounds the usual Fundamentalist attitudes towards the Roman Church. If one is a raging anti-Catholic, you will find all of your stereotypes met, and can say to yourself, ""I knew it all along."" For Roman Catholics, it may cause you to think and do some research on your own beliefs, and that of your Church. If it does that much, perhaps the book has acheived its purpose."
1,The Catholic Undertow,"I have found this book to very unrepresentative of the Catholic Church. Mary Ann Collins facts are skewed to convincing others that the Roman Catholic faith is not to be believed or trusted. I would suggest that anyone interested in reading this book, also go to solid Catholic sources and to double check her support for her 'facts'. The Catholic Church is based solidly on scripture and tradition. Study the history of the CC beginning with the Apostles, and 1st and 2nd century Church Fathers to better understand the Catholic faith. Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch, who learned from the Apostle John, are an excellent place to start."
1,Another bitter diatribe,"No one has ever actually seen Mary Ann Collins in person and there are questions as to whether she actually exists. If you remember Maria Monk, it to was ghost written. I myself am a former fundamentalist preacher who is now a Catholic priest. How did that happen? I actually bothered to get the facts and discovered I had been misled by books like this. If you want to know the truth go to the source...the Catholic Church."
5,A memorable lesson,"Mr. Mayernik transports the reader to the glorious past of Rome, Venice, Florence, Siena, and Pienza; a past in which city builders sought to make their cities into reflections of the perfect heavenly City of God; a past in which every stone, every building, every piazza was an episode of the larger urban narrative that played itself for its citizens as a great ""theatre of the mind.""Mr. Mayernik's writing allows us to view the urban mythologies of these places not as History, events frozen in by gone times and no longer capable of speaking to present generations, but as living lessons in city building; he invites his audience to learn the 'language' of these five cities so that we too can build memorable places."
3,"Dry, but sometimes interesting.","I can't say this is very well written, and it often drags, but it's quite interesting to hear a working architect's opinions on renaissance architecture -- not just that of art historians or other scholars. You shouldn't think it's highly technical, but it is somehow more like an engineering book than a humanistic one (though he does touch on social history, rivalries between cities, and famous personages). An interesting addition to your library if it already includes some books on this area."
3,A good read for managers and students doing projects.,"This book is a fascinating read, relating the story of a manager thrust into a run-down recreation club and transforming it into an effective organisation in two years. The location is Saudi Arabia, with significant religious constraints on western management and the substantially western hospital staff for whom the club is run. The author studied for his MBA after this experience and is therefore able to draw out the relationships between the management problems faced and the principles expounded in the management literature. It is therefore an interesting case-study and recommended reading for students struggling to link theory with practice."
4,A Great Find,"At last, a truthful, real-life management book that focuses on the lucrative recreation and leisure profession. This is a well written and fascinating read that marries practitioner oriented reality with academic theory. The results are most interesting. The text focuses on a leisure business turn-around that succeeded under the most difficult of circumstances. While becoming completely immersed in the story, the reader suddenly finds that the basics of modern business management have been grasped. Well done."
2,Beautiful failure,"The intent of this beautifully written, poetic book is to capture a day in the life of a village. While there is wonderful use of symbolism, the book ultimately fails on two counts. First, there is no reason for the selection of whose lives to follow through the day. Second, the narrator vasillated between omniscient (even knowing dreams and memories) to limited only is visible. When limited, the narrator engages in speculation and philosophic reflection.This has an author worth watching, but as a novel it is an interesting, beautiful failure."
1,"JUNK AND TRASH, HATRED.","This book is absolutely horrible scholarship. Get real.If you want a TRUE source of true and solid teaching....goto the teachings of the Church and not some horrible and trash,wasted writing that is present in this anti-Catholic book.I'd recommend ""Rome Sweet Home"" by Dr. Scott Hahn. ""Upon this Rock"" by Peter Kreeft. If you want solid books these two I'd recommend.Not this book. This book is false and it lies. Spreading filth and hatred.Disgusting.Sickening."
1,"terrible, a blatant lie","I was a convert from Roman Catholicism to a bible based, born again church. I fell for the lies about my faith for about two years. I decided to study the Catholic faith so that I could be a good witness to these folks. Reading this book along side the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the bible has converted me back to the Roman Catholic Church. I will not live a lie. The truth is not a somewhat or a something, but a person. And that person is Jesus Christ and His body is the Catholic Church.2 Corinthians 11:13-15 says: For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is not strange if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.Outside of the Catholic Church this is what your dealing with."
1,it was...........interesting,"After reading this book and reading the reviews I have come to the conclustion that everyone should read something else. It added nothing to my understanding of Roman Catholicism. I'm a devout Catholic who has studied my faith and the scriptural basis for it, and the reasoning behind it. As a result, I am more devout, closer to God, and love being Catholic even more. I urge everyone who wants to discover truth to study christian history. Read the ancient church fathers who came right after the apostles. They know Jesus' doctrine better than anyone. Research for yourself, don't let me, Rick Jones, or anyone else tell you what to believe, but faithfully find out what Jesus taught as best you can by READING!"
1,Rick Jones should have done his homework.,"This book doesn't even deserve ONE star, but I couldn't post this without choosing at least one.Rick Jones should have done his homework.This book is neither factual nor historical, but full of fabrications.He presents what he THINKS the Catholic Church is, rather than what it truly is, making him look like a most unscholarly, biased anti-Catholic.The book convinced me of nothing--and instead it made me want to look deeper into Catholicism.At least the Catholics I know have a better (and solid) defense of their faith.From indulgences to the ""worship"" of Mary and papal infallibility, Rick can't accurately talk against the Church because he doesn't even understand what it teaches. He proved that in his book."
1,More Misunderstanding,"This whole book is one big misunderstanding. As one rater said, he uses a Protestant Bible to compare our Catholic Doctrines with. If anti-Catholics would only let Catholics get a word in. But no, they're too busy with putting us down."
1,Misunderstanding Roman Catholicism,"Nice cover! That is about the best thing that can be said about this book. It takes selected quotes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church out of context then applies Biblical verses inappropriately. Don't bother wasting your $10 on this book, or even printing out the on-line version. If you really want to try to understand Catholics, try some good books by Catholic authors, or spend the $10 on the Catechism of the Catholic Church. If you are looking for a ""good"" anti-Catholic book, don't bother with this one - Rick Jones doesn't even try to understand anything except his own rantings!"
1,This is Anti-Catholic trash written by a Protestant.,"This Anti-Catholic trash is written by an Anti-Catholic Protestant and is totally false! No Christian should be reading AND believing this book! To understand the Catholic faith, read Karl Keating's Catholicism and Fundamentalism or read the Catechism of the Catholic Church AND visit a priest in a Catholic church to discuss with him the beliefs."
2,I'd Rather Watch the Movie,This was a tween piece of fluff. I should have saved my time by just watching the movie. Pete's character was the most entertaining part of the book. His thoughts were realistic which made it funny. The ending made me want to retch. Really? The girl takes out her retainer and they kiss onscreen. Nasty! I would want my money back from the box office.
5,Awesome - buy it - buy it now,This is a must own CD. Once played not forgotten. I've been proud owner for 3 weeks now and the only time it comes out of the CD player at home is when it's in the car CD player. Like many others I found Alabama 3 courtesy of 'The Sopranos' but 'Woke up this Morning' is just 1/12th of the story. All tracks are strong but my personal fave is 'Mao Tse Tung Said.'
4,"Brilliantly original blend of blues, country and techno","If you're looking for more like Soprano's theme ""Woke up this Morning"", you'll only find two: ""Sister Rosetta"", a rolling blues song that reminds one of the Rolling Stones' ""Miss You"", only darker and harder, and ""The Night We Nearly got Busted"", a tension-filled ode to paranoia. For more like ""Woke Up"", try their second release ""La Peste"". That said, this is an extraordinary album: manic, novel and inspiring. Standout tracks include the beaten-but-not-broken gospel ""Converted"", a stellar cover of John Prine's ""Speed of the Sound of Loneliness"" and ""Hypo Full of Love"" a hilarious sendup of AA, evangelical Christianity and drug culture.This album is loaded with rapid-fire musical and literary allusions, dark humor and outstanding grooves. Easily one of the most innovative records of the 1990s."
5,It's just brilliant,"Never wrote a review before, but I'm listening to the CD now and was browsing for any other music A3 has done. Inspired to by this album after hearing the full version of ""Woke Up"" on the radio - all the background voice harmonies and licks that you can't hear on the Sopranos version. It is simply a brilliant album. Extremely creative music and lyrically haunting and hysterical. You could write an essay on the themes behind it all."
5,WOW!,"What an awesome collection of songs........each unique and full of depth. I don't think I have ever owned a CD, until now, where I so thoroughly enjoyed every song. Difficult to classify A3's style............techno, country, blues, gospel........it has everything. It will not disappoint."
5,Who Are These Guys Anyway???,"I, like many unsuspecting others I'm sure, purchased Exile on Coldharbour Lane because I couldn't get enough of Woke Up This Morning just hearing it weekly on the Sopranos. So, I bit, hoping that I'd discover a couple more equally dynamic tunes on the CD.What I surprise I got when I discovered that practically every song in the collection is worthy of a Five Star Rating. In fact, it's the only CD I've wanted to listen to since I purchased it weeks ago. Does the description country/acid house/gospel/techno mean anything to you? Not until you listen to this CD, and then it means the world. Their music is driving, compelling, unique and brilliant.So, where has A3 been all my life? I've looked on the Internet and can't find out a thing about who they are, where they are, etc. amazon.com doesn't even carry their CDs directly. Anyone have any answers? Drop me a line at whiteh2o@catskill.net.BTW, do not hesitate for another second. You must hear this CD."
2,A bit disappointed,"This album did not at all meet my expectations. If you enjoyed 'Woke Up This Morning', don't expect the same greatness from the rest of this album. Other songs were more tongue-in-cheek than 'Woke Up'; not nearly as serious in their tone, if you know what I mean.You're better off downloading 'Woke Up' (if you don't have it already), and maybe 'Converted', if you're curious about the rest of the album.Please don't make the same mistake I did by purchasing the entire album, even if it is only $6.99 to download; you won't get your money's worth."
4,Wow! Crary! Wild! Like nothing you have heard before...,"If you like soul, gospel, blues, country and techmo you will be amazed at the sound this group has. They have been around since 1996, I found them while watching the ""Soprano Series"" with their hit ""Woke up this morning"". In Europe, they are known as Alabama 3, here in the USA A3. The group is from England and the group is ""simply amazing"". I believe the reason they aren't big here in the USA is because of the outlandish costumes they wear on stage. This is not a bad thing but Europeans and Americans cultures are very different. I grew up in Europe so I understand the style but USA??? Watching them in concert reminds me of the Village People singing YWCA. However, their music sound is an experience you won't forget. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to one of their CD's I reccommend ""Exile on Coldharbour Lane""."
1,Horrid Coffee!!!!,"My old cheap coffe pot died and so I found this cool looking one. It was a Mr. Coffee, and it had the thermal caraffe to keep the coffee hot and not cook it to death, programmable, so I thought, ""How could I go wrong?"". Oh, my gosh, it has been a nightmare from day one --- water all over cabinet every morning, it takes two hands to push the button and pour the coffee, and most important, the coffee is horrid!!!! I don't claim to be a coffee expert, but when the coffee is lukewarm after putting creamer in and there is absolutely no way to get a decent cup of coffee from this machine. I have tried everything, even putting it on the strong setting hoping that the water may heat up more. No luck!!! I don't have the problem like some of the other reviewers, with the overflow of coffee onto the cabinet, but we usually have coffee grounds in the bottom of the caraffe. I hate to complain, but I am now looking for a new machine, and I will read all reviews before I buy."
1,looks better than works,very dissapointed.Was able to brew 1 pot of coffee before it began to leak all over counter. the top of the carafe broke.Way to many parts on carafe washers etc.tryed to return but lost reciept.
1,4 days after purchase...,"Alright, my glass caraffe coffee maker broke. I decided I wanted something not breakable. I stood in the aisle of the store comparing different brands for almost an hour and decided this was the one for me. 4 days after I bought it, it malfunctioned. It would not brew more than 2 cups at a time, and for some reason it was over heating so bad that the steam rising up ruined the clock. Now I can't set it at night to brew in the morning. It's useless to me, and a waste of amlost $60 hard earned American Dollars. Mr. Coffee needs to not make anything any more. This was my 2nd Mr. Coffee, and my first was a cappuccinno/coffee maker and the burner plate crackled and popped then shot sparks across the kitchen and would no longer heat. Another malfunction that could have started a fire if I had not been there baby sitting it because it leaked really bad to begin with."
1,The maker of this product must be joking!,"Sunbeam Product, Inc dropped the ball with this one! This machine is a joke! The one thing that it does well is ""make a mess."" Oh sure, it looks good and does shut off automatically, but that doesn't generate a decent pot of coffee.The unit that I purchased and returned within a SIX day time span was horrible.The coffee basket flooded several times, spilling on to my kitchen counter. Needless to say, I went thru several paper towels and dish towels. I wasn't happy about that.The water never really got very hot. This was very disappointing also, since I prefer my coffee hot, not luke warm.The delay-brew function on my unit never worked.I have never been soooooooo happy to return ""something"" in all my life. Target was great at taking it back. No hassles there. Guess they've seen it all before!Skip this coffee maker. It doesn't even deserve a star."
1,Counter top full of coffee!!!!,"After the fourth time cleaning coffee off my countertop and floor, I've had it. This coffeemaker will be returned. The only time I used the timer (had to get a real early start one morning) I ended up with four cups of coffee on my countertop, floor and rug. The rug is now stained since I didn't have time to clean it before rushing out the door (late). Didn't even have a morning cup of coffee. Believe all of these bad reviews. The coffee is lukewarm when brewed and even cooler from the carafe, since it uses it's own heat to stay hot, and there is no heat to keep it hot. The two hour cut off is a joke. There is no heat coming from the burner to cut off. I wanted an insulated carafe so I would have hot coffee in the carafe longer. My microwave has been used more with this model than the others I've had in the past. I think Mr. Coffee spent their R&D budget on the looks and none on the functionality of this machine. BEWARE!!!!!!!"
1,Looks nice but thats all,We have exactly the same problem as a previous reviewer - steam. Its unbelievable. Its supposed to be a 10 cup coffee maker but you are lucky if you get 2 cups. The steam is so bad that it has also somehow damaged the clock face so that we can only see the time at certain times of the day. We have cleaned it as per instructions but it makes no difference whatsoever. We only bought it last month and we arent even using it anymore. I have had really cheap coffee makers that lasted years. Save your cash and dont buy this coffee maker. It looks nice but it sucks.
1,What a DISASTER!!!,"I actually bought two... what a waste of time. First one leaked a full pot of coffee all over the kitchen about every other day. It was NOT user error, either. I read directions 5 times thinking maybe I was crazy. Returned for replacement, and same thing kept happening. Some kind of design problem. Don't even think of it! Bummer, because I really liked the look and countdown timer feature. By the way, I still have coffee stains in the grout of my brand new tile floor!"
1,Leaked all over the kitchen.,"I have to agree with another review I read about this machine. Mine brewed 3 times perfectly, then would leak the next batch. There is an extra feature on this model which allows you to pour while it is still brewing, but the mechanism that allows this does not always funtion properly, causing the water to back up inside the unit instead of flowing into the carafe; it eventually finds a way out and ends up on your counter."
2,Not happy with this machine,"Christmas morning and the slow, ongoing leak, which we worked around over the last year, finally gave way and voila! hot coffee and water and grounds all over the counter and floors. And yes, we clean our coffeemaker daily, and yes, we know how to properly run the thing too. (We gave up on the water filter soon after purchase--it kept falling into the coffee grounds.) Why the two stars? We wanted to love this machine! We wanted it to work! It is a handsome machine with a handsome pedigree (a Mr. Coffee!). The clock is nice. The thermal carafe is lovely. Until the BIG LEAK, we made do with its daily dribble and sputter. But really, after examining the unit carefully before its trip to the trash can, we realized how foolish we were in keeping this fire hazard going as long as we did. That's why I've bothered to write this review. It is not an inexpensive machine; the quality isn't there. Sorry."
3,Dumped it,"Update: We got rid of it and bought a Black and Decker. Too much steam, too many almost disasters with leaking. Husband is on autopilot in the morning and you have to be really careful with this thing. Also, since it really doesn't make hot coffee, he just hates wasting water to heat the thermos. There's no opportunity to change my ""star"" rating, but I'd give it a minus-one.Ok, it does make a lot of steam, but that's the only thing we've found that others have complained about. Just to be careful about the overflows others have experienced, I've put it over the sink when brewing. But we've had no overflows and the coffee is hot. Husband puts hot water in the thermos before brewing. The only thing I'd change is that there's an awful lot of ""stuff"" in the water tank and filling it takes more care than with our old pot. I like it, and the price is right. And I love having only one pot on the counter, not a coffee maker *and* a thermos to keep the coffee hot without tasting burned."
4,Haven't had any problems with this coffee maker!!!,"I disagree with the other reviews! Have had this coffee maker for awhile and actually love it. Have had other more expensive coffee makers and this one is one of my favorites. Use both grocery store coffee beans and high end coffee beans...all turn out great! Did have to figure out the right balance of coffee grinds to add when using the ""strong"" setting. Has leaked once, but think that was my doing...didn't have the thermal unit placed correctly, so it missed the opening. Have recommended this coffee maker to friends and family members and they all seem to like it too."
1,Makes a Mess!,"If you don't seat the filter basket absolutely perfectly, the coffee will not go into the pot and it will overflow, making a horrible mess on your counter and down your cabinets and on your floor, not to mention inside the coffee maker. This has happened to me 4 times now, which is the last thing I need when running late for work. It's amazing that Mr. Coffee let this peice of junk onto the market. They obviously never used the thing themselves."
1,What the reviews say is true.....,"I purchased this coffee maker thinking that it would give me hot coffee for a longer period of time, without losing flavor. The reviews are exact when they say you have to rinse the thermal carafe out with hot, hot water if you want hot coffee. There is no warming plate on this model and if you are expecting your coffee to stay hot for more than 20 minutes then I suggest not buying this product. You are forced to ""re-heat"" the coffee and once you do that you lose the flavor. It looks pretty on the counter, but that's about all it's worth. I am now looking into purchasing a Braun with a glass decanter (the thermals are all getting the same reviews regardless of the maker)."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!,"I didn't buy this coffee pot from Amazon, I actually bought it from Wal-Mart. I am currently trying to negotiate an exchange with Mr. Coffee directly since I lost my Wal-Mart receipt and could not return it for a refund. This coffee pot never worked correctly, ever. I've cleaned up several massive floods from it, and the coffee has stained my kitchen counter tops (ARGH!) and it ran down my white cupboards staining them as well. Please, no matter how cheap the price may be, please don't buy it, it's just not worth it. The few times it did work correctly, it didn't make a very good cup of coffee anyway."
1,Coffee Flood,"I have read all these reviews and I agree with most of them. I thought something was wrong with just mine but most people have the same issues........leaks. Couldn't really ever figure out if it was one leak or two but keeping a towel under the coffee maker is just too much of a mess. Also, I agree with the person who wrote about having to pull the coffee maker out from under the the cabinet to pour water in. Too much drama. Oh well, Mr. Coffee, it seemed like a good idea at the time I guess. Very sad that it didn't work out."
1,............................The damn thing yells at you! ................................,1. The black ink that describes the tiny buttons have poor contrast against the chrome.2. You have to pull it away from the counter to pour in the water.3. It has a beeper that disturbs the whole house. Did they think we welcome yet another annoyance from an appliance that reprimands us that it has some function to fulfill?4. The buttons have poor tactile response. Why not just have a few big buttons or knobs that can be read with bleary eyes BEFORE the first cup of coffee?I wouldn't recommend this product or this company to anyone.
2,"After a while it leaks, but give them a chance to make it right.","This coffeemaker's design is flawed. But my customer service experience on complaining about it was the best I've received from any company in years. They sent their new thermal carafe model, which appears to have the design flaw with the filter carrier taken care of. Give them a chance to make it right. Customer service is part of the equation with any purchase, and Mr. Coffee/Sunbeam has impressed me on that score."
1,Don't buy this machine,"I've had mine for about a year and a half and have hated it most of this time. It would work ok for a while, but then it would proceed to flood my kitchen with coffee pouring out of the bottom of the machine. This has happened on multiple occasions. I tracked down the problem and it is an issue with the poor design of the drip lip that sends the coffee into the carafe as it is brewed. I got a new one because I can't stand cleaning up the messes anymore."
3,Burnt fingers?,"I'm confused by reviews that say this coffee maker causes spills, burns their fingers, etc. I haven't had that problem at all. The basket has never overflowed, so I'm perplexed by that as well. I don't use a paper filter - perhaps that's why.My only problem is the coffee isn't hot enough when it comes out, rather it ""gets hot"", but doesn't stay hot. That's frustrating. Since I won't be carrying the thermal coffee maker anywhere outside my house, that's really not a terrific feature.Still - it makes great coffee. Just wish it was a bit warmer."
2,counter top swimming pool,We bought this coffee pot for the features and the brand. It worked great for about three mounths then when the water filter that came with it got old we took it out. Then the leaking problems started. Every morning we run to the kitchen in anticipation and excitement to see what kind of mess we have and how much coffee we get to drink. We thought it was because the water filter was missing but could not find a replacement. In fact I was looking for a filter on this web sight when I ran accros this review page and found out that every one else is having the same trouble. Its going back on thursday if they will take it. All of the features seam to work well (except for the getting the coffee in the pot part) and it looks good.<br />
1,"Leaky, Leaky, Leaky",I HATE this coffee maker. It leaks all over my white corian countertops and stains them. I have tried several different ways of pouring the water in as well as leaving the carafe lid off and on. It still leaks. Do Not buy this product! Shame on Mr. Coffee for leaving this obviously flawed item on the market!
1,Who wants coffee all over the tabletop?,"At first this unit was wonderful, then one day I awoke to coffee drips. The next day it was everywhere. It didn't do it everyday, but enough for me to say forget it {especially when I awoke one morning to find it had spilled to an inch of the white carpet--10 feet away!} Save yourself the trouble, wish I had."
4,"Looks great, good coffee... only one problem","I bought this coffee maker for my husband for Christmas. So far we have not experienced the coffee leaking that other reviewers have. We have experienced water drips. Seems when we fill the coffee maker with water, the water drips out the overflow hole in the back. We don't over-fill it. We fill it to the Max 10 line (just below the number 10). On the other side of the coffee maker the water level isn't even at the 10. We accommodate for this with a towel under the unit but can't understand why it drips from there. Makes good coffee though."
4,A REFRESHING SHOWER OF JAZZ AND LIGHT-HEARTED HIP-HOP PROSE,"If you like you rap on the cerebral side with a kiss of jazz and deep grooves, then you can dig this jam. Q-Tip's nasal, light-hearted delivery works on the bouncy tracks (""Bonita Applebum"", ""Can I Kick It"", ""Footprints"", and especially ""Luck Of Lucien""), and Phife is his earthier counterpart. The production is especially tight for a debut. Will put you in a mood to dance, chill, or just kick it!!! If you like Tribe now, you'll enjoy this whimisical journey. A MUST!!!"
3,People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,"This was a good album. Not a great one, but a good one. The potential is there. Tracks like ""Can I kick it?"" and ""Bonita Applebum"" are timeless, no one denies that. But that's it. The rest of the album gets lost and falls short of being a true classic. It doesn't hold up overtime. And where's Phife? He's on maybe four or five tracks, thus very little back-and-forth play between him and Tip. A good effort, but not the classic it's made out to be. That would come later."
5,CLASSIC,"I REMEBER MY LIL CUZN LET ME BORROW THIS TAPE,I HAD IT FOR A MINUTE AN HAD NO INTENTIONS OF GIVIN IT BACC.HE SAW IT IN MY BAG AN TOOK IT BACC,BUT IT'S COOL CUZ I GOT A FRESH NEW CD NOW."
3,not their best- pick up low end and midnight first!,"While this has some great tracks and tunes, I don't think it stands nearly in the same realm as The Low End Theory or Midnight Marauders. A few classic tunes, but lots a filler...Better than The Love Movement or Q-tip's solo ish. That don't mean much."
5,This is when hip hop was at it 's purest element,"Man I love the Tribe all there albums are classic Low End and midnight Maruaders and on and on this is what is missing in hip hop today before the industry got a whole of it before it wasn't even music they said buy this joint you won't be disappointed if you like Little Brother, Slim Village, and the producers producer Jay Dilla pick it up"
1,Don't buy this on vinyl!,"Although this is a great album, don't buy it on vinyl from Amazon.The records aren't pressed properly, so the first few seconds of songs start at the end of sides. In one case, ""Can I Kick It"", you hear the first few seconds of introduction, the talking ""Can I Kick It"" then the record ends, you put on the second record then the rest of the song continues!I've just received my second copy of this from Amazon to replace an earlier version with problems, but it turns out that this isn't just a one off, it is a problem with all pressings that Amazon have.The music's a four or five star, the vinyl pressing is terrible."
5,Excellent Album by an Excellent group,"i've been listening to hip-hop since i was very young, at 8 i started.but ATCQ was by far one of the best groups i've listened to. ""I left My wallet in el segundo"" is a good song,so is ""bonita apple baum"". Yes this album is definently a classic. "" Push it along"" is an excelent track, one of the best on the album. to any ATCQ fan, you should cop this immediatly!"
1,Is this some kind of joke?,"What in the hells happened to this guy? He used to create great massive sounds that would have driven the planes to war, as well as beautiful tunes that reminded me of the wandering music in many great computer role playing games.This CD is like some horrible mix of awful 80's europop and a half assed lame attempt at industrial.If you want real Mortiis, get Andem Som Gjorde Oppror or Fodt til Herske."
5,Let me say wow......................,"This CD is the worst CD I've ever heard. The lyrics are absolutely awful, I was expecting alot more out of a Nordic troll. I think vocally this dork has ripped off Peter Murphy as much has he possibly could. I've also read some reviews praising the musicianship on this record. How? This CD sucks in every way possible. If you like it your stupid and this one really isn't up for debate. Sorry if I ruffled any trench coats but this sucks."
5,Lexington Legends,"I love this hat, and all my friends that have seen it, was jealous. I only wished they had more colors, but other then that, it fits like a charm, and looks even better."
2,THE LIONS AREN'T SLEEPING TONIGHT,"PREY is a pointless, meandering, tedious film that basically involves a bunch of lions who want to eat a woman and her two stepchildren. It's like CUJO OF THE JUNGLE. There's nothing new in this film and the typical subplot of a teenager who can't accept her dad's new wife is overdone and distracting. Bridget Moynahan and Peter Weller deliver vapid, phone in performances. The lion mauling scenes are pretty gruesome, but the whole movie just sits there like a pyramid."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I only rented this film because of my fascination with lions. As another reviewer said, in this movie, I was actually cheering for the lions. Typical movie. The character is trying to go for something, the lions come out to eat them, they run, they fall, they get ate.The ending had to be the worst ending ever!! They shot one lion, and burned the other one along with the car they were in. After both lions were killed, the family hugs each other, then start walking. The dad says ""Come on, let's go home"". Ok, so even though those two lions are dead, aren't there other lions in the jungle??? You still don't have a car, are you going to walk back to the lodging area, even though you all have no idea where you are????Sorry to spoil the ending for you, but I couldn't help it. That's how dumb it was."
3,Entertaining movie,"Having just lived in South Africa for several years and having gone on safaris in Kruger, this was a fun movie to watch. Of course, my experience in Kruger didn't come close to the film's (ha) but it was entertaining."
3,better than expected,"Yes it's been done a few times,but it still was entertaining,solid acting,but with most movies you could pick this to death.Like they make the people so stupid.But if you like this kind of movie,then you won't be disappointed,my son like it and he's hard to please."
3,another survival movie,"One of the first things they teach you is that wild animals like lions don't like fire?In this movie four people are killed by lions and three of them had guns.The woman and her step children just don't have any real idea of how to survive in the openor what to use as weapons and fear is before panic.When she gets the keys to the land rover, she panics and crashes it,when she should have tried to back track the way they had come.The movie is just a dumb one about peoplewho shouldn't be allowed out of a city without a survival course?These days it is getting hard enough to survive in civilization..."
1,I WANTED THE LIONS TO EAT THE CHARACTERS!,this was a terrible movie from jump start! you already knew the movie was going to be dumb when the little boy says..........can you stop the car in the middle of africa so i can take a dump! boy how i wished those lions would of ate the characters!
5,Here kitty kitty,"Okay. There were those that did not care for the movie and I respect that. After all we are Americans. We agree to disagree. I received my copy today. I bought it because I watched it on tv and became frustrated waiting for it to be televised again. This is mindless entertainment like ""Commando"". Yet, it provides fun. It takes us away from our cares and troubles for awhile. I am tough when it comes to movies. Do not read into it. Just enjoy it."
5,very good,The book is a clear and comprehensive presentation of concepts and methods of structural reliability. I have applied them to geotechnical engineering
2,No Freddie Mercury = No Good,"Something about this CD is really lacking. It was on the 2nd listen through when my son pointed it out to me. The music lacks the Queen drama and passion that it gets from the vocal performances. Its definitely an acceptable CD for background music, but for the sake of pure enjoyment of Queen, I thought it was very ho-hum."
1,game,this game sucks it was cool til i got to level 4 but then it froze on me and wont let me play any farther then that
3,It's a Guide,"Since it is a guide I have to give it 3 stars. But do you really need a guide??? I have found this out myself, there are 250 missiles in this game which means 50 expansions. I have personally counted the number of rooms to be 115. So if you take the number of rooms in the game(115) divided by(/) The number of missle expansions(50) 115/50 you get 2.3 so in about every other room there is a missle expansions. Of course there is the occasional room that has more than one expansion it so just look everywhere. But the missle expansions make a slight humming noise if you are any where near them. So with that in mind you don't really need a guide because Energy Tanks stick out like a sore thumb and every thing else (wave and ice beam etc.) sets out in the middle of the room in plain sight.and to get 100% in the log book you just have to put on the scan visor and look around in every room. Simple, no??"
3,"For the most part, I like it","As someone who's just trying to brush up on my German before I need to use it this fall, I have found this book really helpful at covering vocabulary and grammar points. It often bothers me, though, that the answers in the back sometimes directly contradict instructions in either the reading or the exercise itself. Also, there have been several times when a word used in an exercise was not in either the end-of-chapter vocabulary, or in the German-English dictionary at the back of the book.As I said, though, for the most part, I do like this book. Just make sure you take it with a grain of salt."
4,Great Book,Great Self teaching book if you can find the time to sit down and read it and do the activities
1,Demagoguery by a Theocrat,Keyes should have simply written one sentence instead of killing so many trees:Gays and religious minorities are not welcome.Makes me vommit.
5,required reading for every college student,"This book should be read by all college students. Why? Because at most universities, students get indocrinated with only the ""politically correct"" viewpoints. Read this book to see what the other side has to say. Well written and very thought provoking. Alan Keyes is a man of integrity, very well educated, politically experienced and he would be a great choice for a future US President. His book presents real solutions to problems and show the mistakes we have made in our culture. This book shows the truth. Also, a very simple, short and easy book to read and inexpensive. Should definately be in every conservatives library. As a Martial Arts teacher, I even make this required reading for all my students to help develop their mental and spiritual side and learn about current American culture. I can't wait for Alan Keyes next book to come out."
2,acceptable,"Correct book and the condition expected from a used book.The cover looks like some kid vomited on it. It should have been listed as ""acceptable"" instead of ""good"" so I wouldnt have bought it."
5,"Good Delivery, quick and well packaged.","This was a present for my dad. It doesn't have a lot of pictures, but I think it will be a wonderful book. Very informative."
2,Too much detail.,"This is a timely book about Washington D.C.'s Metro, given the current controversy about its management, efficiency and reliability. This book answers many of the questions a typical rider of the Metro would ask. However, the writer provides far too much detail about all of the decisions that went into the zoning, planning and building of the Metro. It is very easy to get distracted and lost in each chapter."
5,A Toughtful History,"The author obviously spent a great deal of time doing research in preparation for writing this volume. It not only covers the history of the capitol's subway system, but the social and economic factors leading up to its construction. A very throught provoking history of a unique transportation system."
5,dc metro,"...if you are a dc metro foamer...or just interested...this is the book for you. Meaty with information on planning and execution...nicely, but not lavishly illustrated, you'll have to get your photo jolly's from another source. Great book, though!"
4,The creator of DC Development,"This is a wonderful history of the DC Metro System. This subway has provided the underground infrastructure to relieve mis-guided highway construction that threatened the District. Metro has provided the impetus for development in the Dupont Circle, 7th Street, and New York Avenue corridors. When the new basebal stadium is constructed, it will be served by 2 Metro stations and new development will occur there."
5,"Compelling, Yet Scholarly","This is not your pop-business or pop-anything book. It is a scholarly work that has global political reach, as well as personal impact. Part of the beauty of this work it how systematic it is in providing a well-rounded picture of power dynamics that transcend the century in which they play out."
5,Modern Machiavelli,"An ingeniously crafted book, Siu explores modern-day Machiavellian philosophy as it applies to the corporate and political realms. I found this book to be extremely educational, providing me with the information necessary to recognize and deal with the power plays that happen in every day life. Few will want to follow the recipe given in this book to pursue power, but all can learn directly applicable insights from this book. It is a real shame that it is out of print."
5,Absolute Control,"While this book reminds me of Machiavelli, Sun Tzu and the The 48 Laws of Power, I personally think The Craft of Power has eclipsed them on a whole different level. The organization and method outlined in the book is effective and rigorous. I hesitate to say I think this is the most dangerous book I've ever read. While the control of power of the the book describes does take practice and years of refinement, none the less it spells out essentially ability to control whatever you desire."
3,"Very good, except . . .","This is a very fine word processor, but it won't work on a computer with a program using an updated underlying version of Paradox. Also it won't work with Windows 8."
2,"Should have read the description more carefully. My fault, not the seller's fault","This program was not compatible with my computer (Windows xp), nor my laptop (Windows Vista). I should have read the details more carefully or contacted the seller before purchasing. The program I was looking for had the same name, but was a slightly different version. It was not the seller's fault, so I didn't return it."
4,Word Perfect still great,My order for the Corel Word Perfect 8 came promptly and was as advertised. This is still a great word processing software program and I will continue to use it in conjunction wit my Windows progam.
1,Coral Review,Had a quick delivery. Was not the program I thought it was but that's okay. Excellent service...thanks
5,WordPerfect,"I love WordPerfect, so happy to find this at Amazon! If I COULD write a word processing program, this is what I WOULD have written. It made perfect sense to me from Day 1.Love you WordPerfect!"
1,bad camera,"Pictures were never as great as expected. Finally, after 2.5 yearsit died due to the ""sliding cover failure"" syndrom."
2,Slider issues...,"Great little camera...for a year. We bought this for our kids to use, but ended up using it ourselves. We liked the compact size, that it was all-weather and it took decent pictures. We stopped using our better, larger camera...until we started experiencing the dreaded slider issue. Just after the warranty ended the camera started turning off at random -- we discovered that any little bump or nudge to the slide cover will shut the camera off. And it's nearly impossible to hold the camera without touching the slider. We were quoted a price of $89. + tax + shipping for an authorized Olympus repair, but we'll probably opt to purchase a new camera without the slide cover."
2,Slider Issues!,"Loved the camera... until it broke! This was my first digital camera purchase and I bought Olympus because I've had good experiences with the brand previously. The camera takes good pictures, is lightweight, looks good and I enjoyed it for about 18 months when the slider broke. I am not hard on equipment so believed this to be a manufacturers defect and called Olympus who stated they will fix it... for $150. Great... I'll get it fixed and then have it break again 18 months later? Not a real good deal. What I've got now is an expensive paperweight. I'll put my money where it'll do the most good... in another camera and probably not an Olympus! It doesn't matter how good something is if it doesn't work. Anyone want a real pretty paperweight?"
2,Disappointed,"Bought the camera to take in my kayak. Nice and small, put in a baggie, handle with wet hands, splashes, etc. Great idea and size. I think the camera is very hard to hold still. Many photos are blurred all over, moving subjects are almost always blurred. I think it must have the shutter speed of an instamatic - about 1/30 of a second. I think the problem is with the shutter release. Getting the focus is easy - the extra push to take the image is hard. On a tripod using the timer, touched by no hands, the camera works perfectly. Otherwise it's a challenge and a big disappointment."
4,"nice camera, poor indoor photos","Incredibly small and asthetically pleasing, this is a major upgrade from my 1 megapixel Olympus. Being able to keep this in my back pocket is great (it's actually so small that my major worry is leaving it on the table in a restaurant somewhere). The battery life is excellent (and the battery, like the XD card, is tiny). The major drawback--even on a very bright, sunny day, it cannot take pictures indoors without a flash; without the flash, pictures are dark yellow and severely blurred--surprisingly, they were yellowed and blurred sometimes WITH the flash. Given the weather-proof design, this is clearly meant as an outdoor camera. Overall, though, a keeper."
2,Too many grainy/blurry pics,"This is our first digital camera and, if the lighting is good, the pictures come out beautiful. Unfortunately with children, we do not always have the opportunity to adjust the lighting to get a great picture. When this happens, the pics ALWAYS turn out grainy or blurry (and the flaw isn't noticable on the LCD screen. Only after you download or print is when you see it). It really is disappointing because we have taken many pictures that would have turned out great if not for this problem. My parents have a Canon Powershot (not positive on the model) and they never have this problem--always beautiful pictures. I would definitely suggest that anyone in the market for a digital camera look at a different brand, or at least a more recent model."
4,Great Point and Shoot,"I have now owned this camera for about four years. I purchased it to take kayak fishing. I have taken over 10,000 photos with this camera. I use this came about 90% of the time taking construction job site photos. The camera is great. After four years the only problem is that the movable cover has gotten real loose and closes way to easy to the point of frustration. It costs about $90.00 to send it back to Olympus for repair so I just purchased a new Olympus Stylus 850 SW. This camera is a real step up from the 300. You can not go wrong with any Olympus point and shoot cameras. If you are a Sams Club member the 850 comes in kit for about $159.00. This is a real killer price. Better than what I paid for my 850 via Amazon."
2,You Can Find a Better Camera Than This One.......,"I am so mad I purchased this camera. The design is really bad. The slider is a pain, and from reading these reviews...I am just on egg shells every time I slide it open to take a picture. It is not a very simple camera to use. Sometimes it takes good pics but usually you have to hold it perfectly still to get them perfect. I definatley prefer my mother-in-law's PowerShot by Cannon. I wish I would have spent a bit more and purchased that model! Hind sight is 20/20... Take my advice and tons of others...Skip this one."
3,I need an update,"This is the first digital camera I have owned, and I have used it for 4 years (only one battery!). I always wondered what I was doing wrong when the pix were so blurry with the flash off--but now that I read the other reviews, I see I'm not the only one! And my sliding door has the opposite problem--I can't shut it, and my camera will not turn off. I'm ready for something much better, with a stablizing feature, but this camera was a pretty good basic way to enter the world of digital photos."
2,Slider track worn away,I own this camera for about 2 years. The problem is the lens cover slider track.The metal track has just worn away just from opening and closing the lens cover.Now the lens cover will not stay on the camera causing the battery to die.This is a manufacturing defect
2,"Cute and Small, but not long-lasting","I have had this camera for about a year and a half. The first six monthes I had it I loved it, its cute and takes really clear pictures, and is pretty easy to bring anywhere. After using it a few times a week for six monthes the slide cover stopped working, and I would have to try two or three times before it would open or close for me. I would recomend if you buy this camera to always carry it in a case, the images have started to become less and less clear, perhaps due to me not using one. I enjoyed the camera while it lasted, but I'd recommend going with a different brand if you're looking for a longlasting purchase. (but I guess for the price it's being offered at now is more reasonable.)"
2,blurry indoor pictures,"I bought it cause I like the remote control mostly, but I took it back cause indoors it takes lousy pictures, especially close up. I tried the Canon G2 Camera, although a lot more money, that's the indoor image quality I expect for 400 bucks. I'd say, if you like this camera, buy it, try it, then pawn it on ebay, but I'd go for the Sony P72, which I also have now. That's quick and puts the nifty date on the pictures. Plus some sony tv's now have memory stick slots."
4,Great For Biginers,"I liked the size of this camera, it is very small and take good picture. The only thing that I did not like about it is that it has the option of taking movies but without audio!!! but otherwise it's a good camera :)"
1,All my photos are blury,"I own 3 digital cameras and this is by far the worst. Every photo i take with this camera is blurry. Photos i take with my Canon 1.3 megapixel camera are far superior. The sliding lens cover has also broken and requires me to fidget with the device to close the lens. While i love the lightweight aspect of this olympus, i think its a total waste. go for the new casio (with optical zoom) instead!"
1,Olympus = JUNK,"After having my camera for less than 6 months and taking numerous blurred pictures, the camera finally stopped working all together because it would no longer turn on when opening the sliding lense protector. After sending it back to olympus who wanted 150 bucks to fix it, fat chance!, i took it to a local camera guy who told me that this problem happens to this camera all of the time. And whats worse, olympus refuses to sell the part that is needed to fix it. Currently my camera guy is waiting for a junk olympus to come in (i'm sure it wont take too long) and he will extract the needed part. Problem is, that it will probably have the same problem as my camera! Until then, I wait and take no pictures. One thing is for sure though, I will NEVER EVER buy a product from Olympus, a company that treats its customers so badly and with such little respect."
1,Don't purchase,"Believe the reviews that the slider will break after time. The camera worked ok for about 2 years, but now the slider won't activate the lens. Very poor design. The camera also is horrible at night or with low light. The battery life is realy bad. Will only last for about an hour. Now I'm stuck with all the extra memory cards and batteries for an Olympus. Even so, I still won't purchase another Olympus!"
2,Don't waste your money,I am so disappointed in this camera. I loved the feel and ease of it. The battery life was great and all the pictures looked so good on the screen but when I downloaded them they were terrible. A few pictures were taken from a close distance in perfect lighting and they were great but any pictures that used the zoom or had lower lighting were extremenly grainy and poor. If I had gotten a cheap deal on this camera I would not be so dissappointed but I paid a little more thinking I was getting a better camera. Don't waste your money
1,Poor design and performance,"The camera takes reasonably good pictures when it works, however the basic design and construction make it unreliable. Olympus markets the Stylus as a tough camera suitable for outdoors however the operating design is poor. Notably the battery compartment is where your thumb holds the camera, frequently opening the battery door and interrupting operation of the camera. The power ON/OFF switch is under the sliding cover. It is very sensitive and failed within 9 month. Olympus did a poor job with this design."
3,Beware of the slider,"The camera was average in my opinion. Did what you would expect from a camera in this range, but never liked the low lighting pictures. I was always concerned about the sliding door, as it seemed like a bad design from the get go. Well the door broke yesterday and now I see these reviews of the problems others have had. It confirmed my suspicions. Since it's an older camera now, continue to use it, but sooner or later the sliding door will get you. Now I'm trying to figure out a way to take the door off and rig it, so i can still take pics."
1,good camera ; bad seller,I own another camera just like it. The seller sent me a damaged camera and has refused to refund the cost. I would never buy anything form her again.
2,Watch out for the slider switch...,"I love the security of knowing the camera is water resistant, and the battery life is so good I have hardly ever used the second battery I purchased.But... it has a big flaw, one in common with other Olympus products. If you hand the camera to someone to take a picture... 99 times out of 100... they will accidentially turn the camera off. The slide switch is annoying, overly sensitive, and very very fragile. If (or when) it breaks the repair charge is a minimum $125.Flash pictures are another issue... they always come out with wierd yellowish colors. Overall I'm just barely satisfied with this model, and very unhappy when compared to my prior (stolen) Canon PowerShot."
3,great camera with bad feature,"i have now owned this camera for 6 months. it was completely worth the money. the pictures were amazingly clear. then the sliding lever to close and open the camera malfunctioned. i was warned that opening and closing the camera too much would make it become no good. i did not believe Olympus would allow a problem like that. now i have to return the camera to be repaired. great camera, bad feature."
2,good for day trips,This is a great camera for day time use. It has taken horrible pictures in doors and at night. It takes beautiful pictures in the sun light though. Wouldn't recommend to a friend.
4,good camera for a beginner,I spent months reading reviews for cameras and decided to purchase the OLYMPUS 300 stylus. I bought it for these main reasons:weather proofcompactness3X optical zoomincluded rechargeable batteryIf you know alot about photography I wouldn't suggest this camera. If you want to point the camera at you grandma and snap a shot i do not think you will be disappointed with it.
2,A little more fragile than you'd expect...,I bought this camera almost solely on it's advertised weather resistance and durability... It has underperformed based upon these criteria. I've broken the camera and am pretty sure the warranty has expired -- and it's only been about 3-months. Disappointing!
5,WICKED DARKWAVE INDUSTRIAL,"SEATTLE breeds another Very Talented, BadddAsss band!A.C.W. is up there w/ Rorshach Test, Gridlock, Noxious Emotion & SMP in my book...these guys are killer! I've got their '94 cd ""DESTROY EXISTENCE"" which has a few of these cuts on it and about 6 or 7 others. I dont know why that aint listed here? However, it's a doozey too. If you like these guys check out (the aforementioned &) GODFLESH, I PARASITE, or ANDROID LUST. Oh yeah, MUSICWERKS Rocks!"
2,Correction,"A slight correction to my previous review: apparently all available prints of this film are missing a brief scene of about 30 seconds duration. Please disregard the following: ""This one is also missing almost 30 seconds from a key scene."" My other comments stand. I like the film, I just wish Image had done a better job, and found a better print."
2,Watch the Skiws,"The Cosmic Man was just okay. The Flying Saucer was very disappointing and boring! The Stranger from Venus was interesting, but had a sad ending. I am glad I did not pay much for this multi-movie pack. I found only one movie worth watching."
2,"Ho-hum, another wise guy from space.","A rather obvious rip-off of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, this dreary SF effort gives us John Carradine as a grim wise guy (oops, I mean wise man) from another planet who arrives on Earth to give us the usual warning, while befriending a child as a sideline. His spaceship looks like a giant golf ball, and his major weirdness is that he often appears in negative form. Carradine is good in the title role, but the film is otherwise a dud."
2,Boring,Boring dragging... is this sci fi? too much talking about nothing... but price is cheap so I gave it two stars ..if not for the price 1 star
3,Watch the Skies!,"Of the three, the Stranger from Venus is worth watching. Patricia Neal (Day the Earth Stood Still) is in this one. I loved the romantic ending. I don't want to spoil it for the rest of you."
1,Suckiest Sci-Fi films of all time!,"I rarely buy a sucky DVD ... even my shots-in-the-dark rarely turn out all that badly ... but these three? OH, GOOD LORD IN HEAVEN ! What a Triad of STINKERS ! A Triplet of STEAMING Puppy Piles ! RUN AWAY! HIDE! DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY ! Somebody I don't like is getting this for Christmas !"
3,Old School,"Moe Dee is real old school, sparse beats with lots of macho posturing. The kind of free style that PE made irrelevant, but it took awhile for the MC's to get the word. He's pretty quick and fairly interesting given his self-imposed limitations, and this album is a good pick to get a feel for him. One amusing thing about him is he has a lisp, a funny affliction for a macho rapper. Not really my thing, by fans of Eric B & Rakim, 3rd Base, Big Daddy Kane and LL Cool J will probably enjoy him. Moe Dee has a famous rivalry with Cool J (check out `Death Blow') but this just adds to the amusement, his put down is nothing compared with Ice Cube's infamous, vicious `No Vaseline'."
1,Bad album,Pay no attention to the last reviews this album is horrable.Don't even pay attention to this guy at all cause he sucks.Busy Bee 4 Life.
2,Hmm.. pretty bad,I do like Chinese/ Japanese action or kungfu movies in general. I picked up this one from Blockbuster expecting a so so martial arts movie but as it turned out I REALLY don't like it. Plot is an average B movie type. Acting is so bad it seems funny. Fighting scenes look like amateur work.Hmm.. can't really find anything good to say about it.Only rent it if you are okay with the worst of Van Dam movies.
4,classy,"This shoe is one of the most comfortable and classy shoes I have had in a while. It's style is very feminine and stylish, I love the color. The only thing I can say honestly about the shoe is that is runs in whole sizes only and runs big, so if you were a size 71/2 as myself you would want to get the 7 instead of the size 8. Other than that wear it and wear it well. You will enjoy the compliments."
1,Not 100 % cotton,"The website clearly states these gloves are 100% cotton. As soon as I opened the box the label staring me in the face clearly states 65%/35%! What a complete misrepresentation, and bordering on false advertisement."
3,Slightly disappointing,"If you are expecting 12 pairs of neatly stapled gloves like Wells Lamont, you might be disappointed. What you get is a plastic bag full of loose dark brown (not black) jersey gloves in random order, maybe 7 lefts, then 5 rights. When you straighten out the pile, you will have 12 of each hand. They are cheesy, made in China, but, well, they serve the purpose and are cheap. I wear one pair in normal cool weather doing farm chores and two pairs (one over the other) in cold weather, which works very well to keep your hands warm. But next time I will buy the Wells Lamont brand even for a dollar or two more."
5,"Great, inexpensive gloves","My 96 year old father has peripheral artery disease. Due to that condition, he wears gloves all the time and loses gloves all the time. These gloves are perfect for our needs. Easy to get on and off and they wear and wash well. We have had several pairs for two years now. They are a good price, too."
1,What gives on the 100% Cotton Misnomer,People who work for a living know that 100% cotton gloves last longer and more importantly - don't melt!For those doing hot work to label these wrong (as is the case here)is going to get someone hurt! As well as getting low quality for what is advertised. Shame Amazon - need to fix this!
5,Good gloves for the price,My husband likes these gloves for garden and outdoor work. They also help to keep his hands warm during cooler weather.
3,fun for about a month,"These are really colorful and fun to practice with... but too few shapes in my opinion Once your child understands, there is not much use. They are very nice quality though."
5,Personally my favorite Izzy solo album,"This album rocks! I think it is Izzy's best solo album, although the Ju Ju Hounds album is a close second. I especially like the bluesy Up Jumped the Devil (Ronnie Dawson/Barney Koumis), Memphis (Chuck Berry), and Here Before You. If you like Up Jumped the Devil, suggest you check out Ronnie Dawson's music. These are some of the coolest songs I have ever heard! Unfortunately my version, which IS the Japanese import, does not have the advertised (on wikipedia) two bonus tracks...although Pressure Drop is on the Ju Ju Hounds album. Note that Duff McKagan plays bass on most tracks!"
4,Izzy goes rock-a-billy,"After a five year hiatus, former Guns N' Roses founder and rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin' returned for his sophomore album ""117*"" (1998).""117*"" isn't all that much different from Izzy's debut ""Izzy Stradlin' and the Ju Ju Hounds."" It shows the same kind of Stones/Faces signature, but with a considerable more amount of rock-a-billy thrown in the mix. ""117* isn't the most ambitious, challenging or ground-breaking albums ever created, but it's still a finely-crafted collection of songs showcasing Izzy's unique signature and charm. Fans of GN'R and/or hard rock may be disappointed with this album, but fans of rock-a-billy, old-school country, and Izzy's debut will find much to appreciate."
5,BUY THIS NOW,"I have JuJu Hounds and River as well as 117. If you like anything remotely close to good old rock n roll the way it should be, BUY THIS CD NOW. Izzy is by far the best solo artist to come out of GNR. He can write on anything, his stuff sounds like a raunchier version of the rolling stones. This album picks up right where JuJu Hounds took off. Some might say he can't sing, but I think that his voice rides hand in hand with his music. No matter what other bands you like, whether it be the stones, gnr, zeppelin, hendrix, deep purple, or aerosmith, this will be in your top 10 favorite albums. SPECTACULAR! BUY THIS CD RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,How Can You Not Have This Album?,"When I first listened to this, I couldn't believe that this guy was the head song writer for Guns N' Roses! It's just an incredible album that mixes country, rock, blues, and even a little bit of reggae. If you don't have this album, Guns N' Roses fan or not, get it!"
3,Good Blues Sound But . . .,". . . Not as good as his solo debut. This album displays Izzy tinkering with his sound a little too much. Blues should be basic- simple lyrics, baroque guitar sounds, etc.- here Izzy tries to do a little too much. The album comes off sounding a little too contrived and produced for my taste, but I still give a listen every now and then. If you want to check out some of his post GNR stuff then check out his first album or the import Ride On."
4,Killer down n' dirty rock n roll,"This is a great CD!!! I just bought it and I'm listening to it now. The first two songs aren't bad, but they start out the album a little slow. From Memphis on it gets better. Other good songs are Old Hat, 117 degrees, Up Jumped the Devil, and Freight Train. Actually they are all good, but I didn't want to name them all. This is an album packed full of killer bluesy guitar, and a few songs that'll surprise you. If thats what ya like, buy it...you'll like it. Izzy Rocks!!!"
2,"Doesn't surpass Ju Ju Hounds, don't waste your time.","What a disappointment! Stradlin's previous release, ""Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds,"" was an excellent CD. This latest one, ""117 Degrees,"" is boring, and can't even catch up with the melody or lyrics of its predecessor, not to mention bringing anything new or exciting to the table. GNR fans should not waste their time (or money) on this one."
1,lasted 2 months,"Despite the delicate scale of this watch the bracelet is sized for a man. I took out the adjustable links and it still fell to the middle of my forearm.I had it for two months, then wore it while washing dishes and it filled with water and the indiglo feature stopped working. What ever happened to Takes a Lickin' and Keeps on Tickin'?"
5,"The best, most tasteful, & effective sex book ever written.","The One Hour Orgasm works. It demonstrates with pictures and words, how to master, to the delight of your sex partner, the famous ""Venus Butterfly"" technique. Expect an immediate improvement in your sex life no matter how good it is now. A great way to put the spark back in your relationship by making sex better for both her and him. Also, teaches you how to avoid the biggest mistakes couples make in the bedroom during and after the honeymoon period of their relationship. The One Hour Orgasm will definitely improve anyone's skill and confidence in the bedroom. It is also a lot of fun to practice the Venus Butterfly technique on each other."
1,No magic here &#65533;.,".... Warning, I am going to give away the secret of the supposed one hour orgasm - foreplay. I bought this book, skeptical that there was some hidden technique that would lead to some new level of physical arousal. And my skepticism was deserved as the book contained absolutely nothing new or informative....Basically, the book is written to help people with a rigid upbringing become more comfortable and relaxed with their body and by extension, their partner's body. If the book was marketed as a basic guide to developing a healthy, sex positive attitude, I may have rated it higher. However, it is not sold this way. It holds out the promise that there is some sexual ""magic"" that can occur to rocket your sex life into overdrive. This book is years of date for most people and is basically same type of exploitive nonsense as advertisements that start with SEX SEX SEX. The authors should be ashamed of such a cheap ploy to sell this book."
1,This book is terrible,"The above review must be a shill. This book hints all the way through that it will reveal some sort of secret, when all it is is a series of mushy, vague platitudes. Save your money and buy her some flowers."
2,Don't Waste Your Time or Money on This Book,"Instead, follow the book's repetitious instructions & spend the time &/or money on your partner. The first few chapters are spent selling the reader the book, over and over again, while constantly mentioning this 'amazing Venus butterfly technique'. It's like reading a late-night infomercial.I found the language the book was written in to be rather... Victorian, and more than a little chauvinistic. It referred to women as being 'in heat' and to the various parts of the anatomy with quaint euphemisms. I also have my doubts about people claiming to be doctors when they recommend a petroleum product for love play."
1,R134a Red Cap - DID NOT FIT STANDARD SIZE PORT,The red R134a cap for the high side service port did not fit on a 2001 Ford truck. It would not screw into place. The threads were too short. Stock cap has longer thread length.
5,raw garage punk,"this album, because of its unpolished raw recording, best captures the musical power of AS. It sounds just as if you are at some back ally punk club - complete with poor, subpar sound systems. This is the result of having been unprofessionally recorded on a tape player, at such an event.Nothing is better then raw recordings of punk, since studio recordings only subtract from the effect that punk is supposed to create in the first place."
4,Hi-Five's Successful Debut,"This Southwestern teen R&B ensemble, Hi-Five found success with a sound that updated the elements of New Edition. The original members Tony Thompson, Roderick Clark, Russell Neal, Marcus Sanders, and Toriano Easley all appear here; Toriano Easley would be replaced by Treston Irby on the second album. The kiddie-pop hip-hop flavored uptempo tracks with the new jack swing vocals were Hi-Five's road to success and they ranked as one of the more popular youthful groups of the early-'90s. Their self-titled debut was an instant smash and even sprung off a few hit-singles; ""I Just Can't Handle It,"" ""Just Another Girlfriend,"" and the two huge hits ""I Like the Way (The Kissing Game)"" (No. 1 Billboard, No. 1 R&B), and the Eric Foster written ballad ""I Can't Wait Another Minute"" (No. 8 Billboard, No. 1 R&B). The album would also hit No. 1 on the charts, but was far from the level of the champions in this genre, Boyz II Men, Bell Biv DeVoe, and Guy."
3,What are the dimentions of this toy box?,"I've been looking everywhere but can't find the dimensions of this toy box. The Babies R Us near us doesn't offer this toy box so I can't go in to measure it either. Any assistance would be GREATLY appreciated!!!Thanks,KJ"
4,Hinge does work if put on correctly,I love this little toy box and thought it was very easy to put together. The hinge was a little more difficult but we discovered the first time we put it on we had it backwards. There could probably be a better hinge put on but all in all it is a nice toy box and was exactly what I was looking for.
3,Not a great bargin,"The wood finish and detail were above average, but not excellent. The instructions can be improved with better diagrams. Considering the price and shipping costs I don't consider it a bargain."
2,Doesn't match up!,"We have the dark pine olympia crib and changing table and we really would have liked the toy box but we passed because the toy box at our local BRU that says ""Dark Pine Wainscot"" doesn't match the rest of the Dark Pine peices. The finish is different (lighter) and the styling is off compared to the rest of the line. Honestly, to us it looks like a peice from another set that they are trying to pass off as ""matching""."
1,This DVD player stinks,"From the day I took this player out of the box, I have struggled with it. It regularly freezes up when an item is selected from the menu. To un-freeze it, you must either open the tray or turn off the unit. It's garbage. I expected more from JVC."
3,(Addition to my already posted review),"Following that dictum, I might point out that, especially in two areas of contemporary concern, Hamann's thought is highly relevant: Oswald Bayer has shown in Autoritaet und Kritik (1991) that Hamann's hermeneutics -- antedating by two centuries Derrida's reflections on intertextuality -- provides the basis for a devastating critique of deconstruction by subverting the French thinker's concept of the ""center,"" and demonstrating where the true center (""Mitte"") is to be located. Further, there is presently a lively discussion among scholars of Hamann's critique of Kant's famous essay: ""What is Enlightenment""? Berlin's present study would have done more justice to Hamann's thought by discussing such developments as these and others, which were available during his lifetime."
2,These boots are not waterproof,"While these boots are very comfortable to walk around in, I found out today that they are NOT waterproof. I am in New York City's snow storm, and the streets are a mess. As I stepped in several deep piles of slush/snow/water I found both of my feet getting wet. Very disappointing."
1,SCAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This company is fraudulent! Please google them & you will see what I mean. I was taken, as were countless others.This was an expensive lesson for me; pls. don't make the same mistake."
2,the best of or any greatest hits package of billie jo spears,what is wrong with all these greatest hits packages that leave off Marty Gray and It Could'd Been Me which in my opinion were two of her best hits that have never appeared on a so called greatest hits package. i will not buy one till these two hits appear/ Oh well might as well transfer from a 45 to disc. Anyone who buys into this greatest hit crap that leaves off two essentials. ought to be screwed. Half of whats there was never a single release.
2,Needs another Brown Crayon,My husband and I are big coffee snobs. We used to frequent our neighborhood Peets until we moved from California last summer. Since then I have been looking for a blend to meet our everyday coffee desires.The best I have gotten off Amazon is the Green Mountain Organic Espresso Blend...but I thought I'd try this one since it was a little less expensive and it seemed well blended..... butIt takes about twice the coffee grounds for a good cuppa...so the value rational is out the window! Then then while I'm drinking it I resent that I have four more pounds to get through since this tastes like diner coffee. Nothing complex or robust about this at all. Does not make a good latte.
2,Flawed,"This is chunky, bright and fun to handle for the recommended age group (2+) but has some problems. The servo noise from the mechanism is so loud that the music and sound effects are barely audible. The engine itself tends to jump track on the bends. You can overcome this by playing with the angle/elevation of the track and the direction of the train but it's supposed to be a simple, flat circuit so this would seem to be an awful lot of work to keep it on track. The motion of the train causes the track to slip around on a bare table or wood floor which can also unseat it. Finally the trigger (pushing down on the train driver) seems to be a bit of an art; you have to push it in just the right place & angle, and if you get it really wrong the whole thing can flip up and the bits go all over the place. I also think it might be a little boring for more advanced 2 year olds. It's cute but for just a few more dollars you could get something much better designed."
2,Incomplete Body Tone,"Sara Ivanhoe's other videos include ""Yoga for Dummies"" and clearly this video is intended for beginners. She even explains how to hold a dumbell (just in case you don't know: place in palm of hand, wrap your fingers around one side of it, and your thumb around the other). The program consists of holding traditional yoga poses with the lower half of the body, while performing strengthing exercises with the arms. For example, shoulder presses while standing on one leg in Tree pose, bicep curls while in the lunge of Warrior, or chest presses while in Bridge. I imagine that 20 minutes of this might provide an adequate workout for a beginner. For everyone else, this video is merely a fun way to play by merging two exercise media."
1,It's all Greek to me,"I was really looking forward to reading this but when I got it, I found that it was all in Greek (even thought it said that it was all in english)."
4,Reunion falls short of expectations.,"Five years after recording their amazing debut album and promptly self destructing, the Adolescents reunited and recorded this collection of new and old songs. Some are good and some are just plain weird. ""She Wolf"" is a mutant Alice Cooper meets the Damned and gets drunk on Jim Morrison's grave Hammer House of Horror type epic which leaves your average skateboard riding punk fan dumbfounded. Their version of the folk standard ""House of the Rising Sun"" retains the original female gender narrative which, sung by the prematurely world-weary Tony Montana, adds sort of a Santa Monica Blvd. perspective to it."
3,A long awaited follow up to a classic punk record!,"This album came out in like 1986, almost 5 years after the first legendary Adolescents album. This one is not nearly as good, but it's a good album. They do a great cover of House of the Rising son that blows the original away. One thing was for sure, they didn't sell out like a lot of other punk bands of their era did. They kept their same style and remained true to form. A must have for any serious punk collector"
3,All a matter of perspective,"I was in Las Vegas not too long ago. At two in the morning (or two in the afternoon, for that matter) the steady chiming of the slot machine bells in the hotel casinos sounds a lot like ""Metal Machine Music!"" The only difference here is that you don't win any prizes or money by playing this CD, though that could change!"
1,Don't take this release seriously - Lou Reed certainly didn't,"Anybody who claims they like this is just trying to be ""different"". This isn't musical at all, I could have made this garbage myself. I'm sure everybody knows it's just a collage of guitar feedback, intended as some sort of joke or statement by Lou Reed on the state of popular music. I know there's some people out there looking for an argument who like to defend it, but it's really indefensible."
3,Hmmmm,"One thing first: this is a record consisting of 4 pieces of continuous unlistenable feedback. Nothing else. It drones on forever. A lot has been written about this record and most reviews do not really explain that it is simply noise. There is no melody no rhythm no structure. It cannot really qualify as music as such. If you read any piece on it by Lester Bangs for example or any review, you will not really get what it is until you actually listen to it. It does not matter if it was a joke or an actual attempt at exeprimental music, it fails a both. Still the concept of a major artist indulging in such a work at that time and at this point in his career is fascinating. Beacuse of that it is an indispensable addition to any serious rock collection: simply because it is historically important in a strange way. You will probably not listen to it often. Others have done stuff that is pretty close such as Steve Shelley with Sky Yen."
1,P.T. Barnum was right...,"We all do things we later regret. that we are ashamed of, but, in most cases, we don't leave a permanent record (excuse the pun) of that transgression. Unfortunately for Lou Reed (and us), he has left ample and ugly evidence of his immaturity with ""Metal Machine Music,"" which is nothing more--NOTHING--than a spiteful kiss off to a record company Reed felt was maligning him. This CD is unlistenable, which is exactly what Reed intended when he released it.I can only imagine Reed's condescending chagrin at the airheads spouting off about how great this album is. Grow a brain, people. Or at least some ears."
1,Can't You See It's A Joke?,"I've read the other reviews, and I can't believe it. ""Contemporary classical music""? ""Experimental music""?Man, are yu SO afraid not to be with it?"
1,No Stars really for this joke.,... This is essentially useless noise. There is no talent here. Lou Reed has some fine albums and did some great work with VU. This is a joke. Listen to John Coltrane's Giant Steps then put this on. You'll laugh.
1,No Stars really for this joke.,"Lou Reed says ... off to critics, his fans, or anyone else. This is essentially useless noise. There is no talent here. Lou Reed has some fine albums and did some great work with VU. This is a joke. Listen to John Coltrane's Giant Steps then put this on. You'll laugh. ... Reed is a good poet, though."
3,Just entered a rating to pose a question,"I thought Lou released this to get out of a record contract. He owed the lable more music, they wouldn't let him out of the contract, so he thought ""fine"" I'll give you four sides of noise. Contract satisfied; screw you. I don't know where I heard this (I heard it at least twenty years ago) but the way I heard it he simply wanted to move on and his record company insisted he still owed them music so he put this out as a sort of ""kiss off."" Now, I don't know how much interest he really had in this project - only Lou knows that and who can tell if when discussing the subject he'll actually give us the real story. I absolutely could be wrong; but I thought that's what happened - he was satisfying a contract so he could move on. Anybody really know differently?"
1,On right now!,"Ahhhh Metal Machine Music!....Where to start? I do remember the release date of the original LP back in 1975.Sally Can't Dance (which has aged rather well..not cheap and smutty as Lou called it),was a surprise ""hit"" and RCA wanted more of the same.I never bought into the imagined classical segments or the pre-curser to noise and industrial nonsense.This was and IS a giant contract fulfillment and record company drop all in a nice double LP! This will incite riots and violent behavior in anything that is not dead...Animals,plants,bacteria even wallpaper will peel if this is on...My advice? BUY IT and piss off all your enemies by playing it loud."
1,"Ow, quit it.","Ow, quit it. Ow, quit it. Ow, quit it. Ow, quit it. Ow, quit it. Ow, quit it. Ow, quit it. Ow, quit it. Ow, quit it. Ow, quit it."
1,I'll help you understand...,"To understand the 5 star review below, click on the reviewers name and read his other reviews. Enough said."
1,"Get Real, People","I'd be willing to bet a bundle that the vast majority of the folks who are giving this thing 5 stars probably don't even own a copy, and the few who do never actually listen to it. After all, it is nothing but unlistenable noise, a review that The Trouser Press Record Guide refers to as ""a description, not a value judgment.""Whether Mr. reed meant this as a joke on the artsy-fartsy crowd, or simply as a way out of his contract isn't known, but it is quite safe to say that he did not mean it as any kind of artistic statement because it clearly isn't one. Unlike say, The Shaggs, who had an innocence and sincerity to their work, this is nothing but cynical manipulation, and that should not be rewarded."
1,Stick a fork in your ear...,"...it'll be about as painful. I like the ""ow, quit it."" Yeah, I hear the voice of Bart Simpson.I bought this as an 8-track tape in the early 70's and listened to it for about five minutes. I got it. A big flip of the bird to the suits. Hah! One star for the noise and five for the sentiment."
4,Excellent financial insight!,"This album provides astonishingly accurate insights into the global economics of today's multinational financial institutions. How Reed was able to predict future events in such a highly accurate manner is both intriguing and frightening. An essential, timely piece which everyone interested in global financial politics should listen to immediately."
1,"Not music, literally just noise","I guess I don't do enough hard drugs to make sense of this thing, so I'll just put it straight. It is literally feedback (squeaks and scratches) being recorded using amps and a guitar or two. There is no music-just noise. Some people say this is groundbreaking and genius. I say it is crap. I know the story (basically a f u to the record company) and I get it as a joke-I even think it is clever. But to buy this album and put it on proves that the customer is the real idiot here. What makes me laugh even harder is that he just reissued this album not too long ago-meaning that some moron is willing to buy and listen to this more than once! If you are considering a purchase of this album, do yourself a favor. Lock yourself in your bedroom, then punch yourself in the we!ner. It will provide a similar effect but it will save you the 9 or 10 bucks that it cost to buy the album."
2,Art Imitates Rock,"It amazes me that people who hate this album and people who love it have actually spent the time listening to it when, clearly, Mr. Reed's intention is not that it be placed on a turntable but rather that it be hung on a wall. This is not music, it is art. And, as is so often the case when entertainers switch formats, it is not very good art.Maybe that's not totally fair. Lou's foray into the world of art isn't as bad as Usher's foray into acting ('In The Mix') or Hasselhof's foray into music ('Night Rocker') but those guys sucked to begin with. As art imitating a rock album, MMM is mildly successful. Think of it this way, you can own a piece of controversial pop-art by a famous dude for under 20 bucks... not bad huh? The drawbacks to ownership are that it is controversial in a very limited circle of people you don't wanna associate with who exist outside the art world and the risk that someone might make the mistake of putting a needle to it."
4,"hmmmm, not bad... i think..","i was under the impression that this album would be a complete cacophony of noise and grating feedback. i suppose it might well be to some, but for some reason to me it sounds like actual music a lot of the time. granted, it's not a heavy rotation type of record, but for what it is it's pretty good.of course the melodies and harmonies i'm hearing could be a result of heavy psychedelic use back when i was a kid. in the end, lou obviously made this as a slam on the music industry and whatnot, but in the process he made a pretty good piece of, dare i say it, art."
4,Moderate volume as an ambient piece,"Loud as a testosterone manifesto.I like Lou Reed's guitar solos.It is eternity and a blink of an eye.It is a landscape on another planet.A planet inhabited by monsters that scare you andangels that cry blissfully.If it hurts your ears turn it down a touch.They should've made a documentary.Lou Reed, Do another one."
1,A Joke That Is Still Going Strong,"Lou Reed has gotten so much out of so little in his prodigious recording career. In some ways I think he had more than a little Andy Warhol in him; cranking out so many albums with worthless tracks, almost tempting his audience to reject him while still reaping the monetary benefits from the music industry.This was Reed's best attempt at alienating everyone, with a double-album of harsh feedback, though it often sounds like a transistor radio that was deliberately set between two stations. Even at its initial release the debate was furious on whether it was Reed at his most creative genius - bringing avant-garde to a bigger audience - or if it was a joke and a means to get out of a bad record contract.I feel it was the latter and still wonder why the project retains a number of fans. Reed stopped laughing years ago and certainly can only shake his head in amazement that some people still don't get it."
1,"And the little boy said, ""But the emperor has no clothes!""","I wouldn't recommend buying this CD unless you have first listened to it. It consists of feedback, screeching, and rumblings. The recording is boring and monotonous. It is the recorded equivalent on running fingernails down a chalkboard or chewing tinfoil. What amazes me is that people take this recording seriously. Some see it as the starting point for the genre known as industrial music. Look, if you want to listen to bad music, that's fine. Just don't assume that there is anything close to fine artistry in this recording. Save your money and buy something that won't make you so angry."
1,"""My week beats you year""...","... wrote Reed in the original liner notes. But, wait this ain't Transformer; not even Berlin. This is the masterpiece of rock's most self indulgent maniac (""I've suffered for my art"" --he seems to whine--, now it's your damn turn!!""). Aural equivalent: tztztzttrtrtrtrtrttztztztztztzttztztztttttltltltltltltlltltltltlltltltltltlltltltltlgrgrgrgrgrgghdsgjdsgjhgjhgjhg. Sounds intriguing for the unbearable snobs who dug this (if they actually bought this!), and for anybody with nothing better to do, you've probably listened to the samples.I'm tempted to give it 2 stars just for the sheer audacity, but then again Salvador Dalí used to throw his body down the stairs just to gain other people's attention.Fart, record it and label it as Metal Machine Music 5 (the revenge). Fans will be delighted."
1,I want to walk out into speeding traffic,"because it would end the misery of hearing this crap! No better yet, I would stick my head into a combine to end the pain. What complete garbage."
1,HORRIBLE!,"It's a pretty good joke and statement, not much in the way of an album though. Delievers what it promises though, a ton of feedback. My main problem with this is that people like to compare it to actual metal music, which is wholly ridiculous."
1,Utterly Worthless,"I was recently having a discussion with a friend of mine over the definition of ""music"". He, being a pure traditionalist on the subject declared such things as electronica and rap as ""not real music"". I defended both those forms and said that those were most definitaly ""music"". He then asked me where my line was, and I replied ""Metal Machine Music"". This is not music, this is noise. Is it impressive that Lou Reed got this released? Yes. Is it a bold statement of his artistic beliefs? I guess. Is it music? No. Is it worth listening to? Certainly not! It has no melody, no rhythem, and nothing to make it worth a listen. A truly punk artistic statement, but in this case, artistic statement makes for an absolutly boring, irritating listening experience. Don't waste your money."
1,Two reasons NOT to buy this album,"If you listen to the samples and read the reviews, you should be wise enough not to buy this horrible baboonshine of an album. However, here comes my two main reasons why you should never even consider to buy it:1. It has no substance. The painting by Jackson Pollock and music by John Cage most definately has a substance to it. MMM hasn't, for one simple reason: Lou Reed is a songwriter, not a composer. He never had the skill to carry out a project as this.2. The CD format. As the music has no substance, the nature of the double vinyl album was of essential importance. As one small, convenient compact disc, the album simply isn't the same, as a lot of its conceptual value is lost."
1,A useless record that isn't worth two cents,"If there is a record out there that deserves 0 stars, this would be it. It is complete nonsense. Anyone claiming ""masterpiece"" or ""under-rated"" or ""deep and meaningful"" need to get their gears checked. The fact that it exists is more humorous than anything."
1,"Annoying ""music"" from a major artist who went off the deep end here.","One of the worst albums every made by a popular artist. Period. ""Metal Machine Music"" is annoying feedback without any structure. When my dog howls it sounds more like music than this.I can think of only one or two albums worse than this--the albums that John Lennon and Yoko Ono made (you know their ""artistic"", avant garde ones). This is more annoying and tunless than the Youtube video with the dog that barks but sounds like it is screaming--and that was at least amusing.If I could give this release 0 stars I would.Lou Reed should be embarrassed."
3,Metallic Mechanic,"When you have a lousy label and one more record to make for 'em...you do what expresses your New Yorkishness.It's the Amine B Ring, Daddy.No mo'andnuffsaid."
2,Not a great album......,"...but as a giant, metaphorical single middle finger gestured straight at the suits in the recording industry, it's outstanding!"
4,Lou Reed's Humor,"This album,apparently was handed by Lou to the company he was with at the time to try and break his contract.Interestingly although this album was enough to make the company suits cringe at the time,it did not have the desired effect for Lou.Over time it has become part of many list's such as the one here because it really is not that bad at all,but definitely sits on an orbit out past the ordinary.I dont believe that their is much more happenning within the recording other than than wild feedback and and sounds that come from pushing equipment into areas past the point that they were intended to go,thus giving the listener some very interesting sounds to digest.If anything it is an album that i would recommend on the basis of it's uniqueness and also to hear guitar and feedback at levels that push everything into thered."
2,????????????,great cd to play when you want to get rid of people who annoy you. this record will drive most people nuts!what kind of altered state was lou reed in when he recorded this album??hmm.......get new york or coney island baby instead...any other lr cd is pretty much recommendable over this. I will give it at least two stars because 1. Lou Reeds friggin rocks!! 2. I'd buy this before buying some crap by Britney Spears or some talentless top 40 caca.
2,2001 Lesabre Floormats,"The floormats are not a good fit in the front floor boards. Neither side fits like the manufacturers mats and they are not cut as seen in the picture. If you want something that is a meg shift fit, then these are for you."
3,"Average, same old information","This book is a fine introduction to personal finance. If you already know the basics, then this probably isn't for you. The author lost me when she starting quoting the Bible though. If you are a conservative Christian, run, don't walk to pick up this book that I found at Walmart (how telling). If you don't want someone moralizing to you about marriage in a finance book, maybe you should look elsewhere."
1,Tips for ultra-conservatives only!,"I bought this book, with the interest of hearing the author's thoughts on being financially responsible. I was quite excited to learn some common-sense approaches to handling my money well. However, I returned the book after stumbling across numerous references to ultra-conservative organizations, and reading the author's tirade about how children should only be raised by both a loving mother and father.The financial info was decent, at best. But, it was completely eclipsed by the author's thinly-veiled messages about Christianity, the greatness of the church, and how healthy kids can only be raised by both a mother and father. And, that was all within the first 20 pages!What does any of that have to do with financial tips and advice?!"
1,Preachy Right-Wing Christian with Mediocre Money Advice,"If you're a right wing Christian, and a money novice, you'll probably love this book. However, I wish I'd spent my money on a different couples' finance book.Don't be fooled by the hip title and cool cover. There are a few nuggets of decent financial advice in here, but you have to wade through Singletary's Dark Ages social-conservative propaganda and Bible verses to get to it, and it's really annoying if you're not so inclined.Even more troublesome is the fact that some of her money advice seems to be based on her right-wing ""values"" rather than on sound financial reasoning. (For example, I learned from Michelle's book that couples who maintain separate checking accounts are just keeping open an easy ""out"" for a future divorce. Thanks, Michelle, for your opinion, but I'd prefer to know the financial and logistical pros and cons of separate or joined or partially joined finances.)"
2,Your Money and Your Man,"The economic information that the author suggests, many times is useful. However, she is SO ANNOYING to listen to, I'd be suprised if there was anything of value regarding marriage in this book!!!"
5,New Ideas! New Thinking and New Research!,"The brief book is a real gem for those looking for ideas on how to best do church in a changing culture. I am the pastor of a young church in New York City and we studied this book as a team. The chapters are brief, tied directly to local churches who are doing it and full of in your face questions to get you thinking. The chapters on 'team teaching' and 'church the city' (vs. being one church in a city) were very challenging. My only complaint - the analysis was too brief.If you are a pastor or on staff of a new church, my advice: Buy this book, read it with your staff, follow the web links and send Dave Travis a donation so he will keep doing this research for us!"
5,epic voyage,"One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of those few novels that is magical, beautiful and can capture the very kernel of mind to wake you up from the reality of Latin American world. The writer questions the propriety of the superstructure of the governance of mankind and the whole lot of theories and principles which are supposed to deliver the mankind from the drudgeries and miseries but which do not.To read this novel is to experience darkness and the failure of mankind."
4,They were as expected,They were cute and everyone at my party got a kick out of them. Like that they come with a tiny rubberband to keep them open.
3,"Really cute, but half of them break when you try to open them","I really like this idea especially for summer drink fun, but about half of them break when you try to open them. They are very inexpensive to buy and very cheaply made. Still, even if half of them work they cost less than some of the others and they do look nice in the drinks."
1,Very Low Quality,"I didn't expect really sturdy or exceptionally well-made paper umbrellas. I bought a whole gross (144) because I knew there'd be several unusable ones or they'd break. I didn't have terribly high expectations, honestly.That said, I'm very disappointed in what I got. The little plastic stays to keep the umbrellas open don't work on half of them. Some of them didn't even have the little plastic stays. I got ONE blue one in the entire gross. Definitely not a very good assortment of colors. Speaking of color, many of them weren't even completely colored and had white patches at the edges. I was very frustrated with this low quality product which ruined the project I'd bought them for."
4,great if having a parties,"The cocktail umbrellas are nice if you are having party. I personally just got them to play around and I was expecting about less then 100, so when it came I was surprise that it was 144. They came in good quality and were colorful."
4,An Interesting Find,"This book is perfect for teachers who follow a cirriculum based on weekly themes. I spent 8 years as a preschool teacher and found that when I was looking for books to read during ""circus"" week, this was a wonderful source. I would recommend it to any teacher (or parent for that matter)!"
2,Dull,"I really wanted to read this book, even though it's outdated, to get background for a trip that's planned. However, unlike any other Michener book I've read, this was dull, dull, dull. I didn't finish it."
3,Interesting period piece,"I took this book on my 10-day trip to Spain. Though I did not read it cover-to-cover, I enjoyed reading passages about places I had seen or events I had read about. It is a very dated account of Spain, but in many ways that is part of its charm. He refers to the Republicans in the Civil War on occasion as the ""Reds"" and at times seems to have swallowed a Racion of Franco propoganda in one gulp. I found his description of the events of the siege of Toledo quite telling: he admits parenthetically that his account is based on one particular right-wing book and that many of the facts he had subsequently learned were apparently a Fascist myth."
1,Awful,"This book is a rambling, dated, starry-eyed tourist's view of Spain. For a cultural guide or a historical record, tryGhosts of Spain: Travels Through Spain and Its Silent PastorThe Buried Mirror: Reflections on Spain and the New World. If you must buy it, get some tissues -- you'll be bored to tears."
1,"My gosh, it is NON-Fiction","As a James Michener fan I thought this would be his usual excellent book. It may be good for others, but it wasn't for me. Well duh, it is NON-Fiction. I'm sorry but it didn't have the usual Michener way of grabbing you. This is probably a great book for a studious reader, someone interest in the details of Spain (Iberia). Unless that's you maybe you should skip this one."
2,Some interesting observations but much too long,"Last winter I visited Southern Spain for a short holiday. I took Michener's book with me, a long pocket not too heavy. I have never read a book by Michener before. I found that Michener takes a lot of words to tell his story. Parts of the book are interesting but also a lot is very boring. When I was in the plane back home I stopped at page 500 and never started again with the book. I'll probably not try another Michener."
1,VERY inferior bookbinding,After reading about 50 pages the pages began falling out and continue to do so. It is a book that should be removed from the inventory of the seller.
1,It doesn't work,"Beware of long convoluted gobbledygook from anyone. It won't work. This book is a fine example -- Check out chapter 10, ""Future Forecasts"". Carolan says there will be a big top about October 1995. Was there? No. Then ""Expect a major low in the Dow Jones Industrial Average near Monday, July 27, 1998."" There was a small low in October which led to the rally into 2000 but all July had was a small top. This guy is batting 0 for 2, which is perhaps to be expected given his odd semi-astrological methods. There are tons of good ways to measure the market that do work. You don't need this book. I stopped to review it because I am now on my way to recycle it along with some other waste paper."
3,"Some interesting stuff, but a lot of rubbish too","I bought this book back when it first came out. I found it an odd mix of interesting ideas and off-the-wall speculation, with a lot of dubious math thrown in. I recently pulled it down from the shelf where it has sat for lo, these many years and it still strikes me that way. If unorthodox theories about mass psychology interest you, The Spiral Calendar is worth a glance. But don't expect too much in the way of useful information."
4,Pooch Arthritis,"My Corgi seems to do better with this tablet. 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 at night. Her desire to run and play has increased since being on this tab for over a year now. Her soreness from exercise doesnt seem to last like it did before starting her on the Arthogen. Best of all, she will take it without me having to disguise it!"
3,"Good watch, bad band",The watch keeps ticking (good for ten years according to Casio) but the band lasted only about 12 months before it cracked and broke apart. A replacement band can be purchased for the same price as the whole watch. Go figure
3,It keeps time,"This Casio is a very inexpensive watch that lacks the features I was looking for (my own fault).Pros: The good news is that it keeps time.It features dual time, a stopwatch with the usual lap timer, will light up at the push of a botton and has an alarm.Cons: Plastic band that is non replacable unless maybe you can order one from Casio. So if it breaks, replace the watch. The alarm is useless unless you are in a very quite environment.It does not have a countdown alarm which was a feature I was looking for.That was my fault however.In my defense of stupidity I have found that most watches on the market today do not include this feature in their discriptions but is an included feature.All in all, if you just want a inexpensive watch to wear to work, this will work."
3,Doesn't keep time well...,"Sorry, but this watch loses time quickly. I knew it was inexpensive, but I didn't expect to have to reset the correct time so much. Otherwise, it is a nice, inexpensive watch."
2,poor crystal,"When my last Casio's band broke (about the 3rd in 6 years), I looked at my replacement options. I ordered this one because it looks a bit classier than the standard Casios (I wear it to an office), and the last one I owned was so complicated I gave up trying to set the alarm. In the week that I've owned this one, two significant annoyances have become apparent: it has picked up two obvious scratches to the watch face, even though I've done no contact sports or anything else that would likely have led to scratching the face. At this rate, it will look pretty bad in a year. Second, the numbers are only readable if I turn my wrist further towards my eyes than I've ever had to with prior Casios (in other words, you have to be looking almost directly down at the face to read the numbers.) I think both problems stem from the fact that the crystal bows out slightly, rather than being perfectly flat like my prior Casios."
2,Short lived,"I really like the style of this watch - it is my personal favorite. I am ordering the third one now because the armband lasts maybe 18 months or so. Keep in mind I wear this thing day and night, under the shower, hiking, camping, swimming etc. It's not unexpected for the armband to break, I just wish they made an inexpensive replacement. I looked and found a replacement armband for the same price as a new watch.I don't like to waste stuff. Getting an armband replaced should be easy and inexpensive."
3,Brittle Watchband,"This is a great watch, with one major flaw. Its Lightweight, has a big screen for my weak eyes, and is full featured. I am an avid sea kayaker, and have found the 50M water resist to be fine for getting dunked, and even swimming. But the watch band will break after 2 or 3 years, and I've had to replace the entire watch because the replacement band is the same price as the discounted watch price! I have three of these watches. One is on my wrist, and the other two are still keeping accurate time in the top drawer of my dresser, unusable except as pocket watches. Isn't it ironic that they put a 10 year battery in these suckers? Why not put a 3 year battery in it, lower the price by 5 bucks and call it a disposable? Even though I love the watch, when this one's band breaks, I'm going to look for something with a reasonably priced replacement band."
4,Basic watch,This is my second one in 10 plus years. The first one's alarm doesn't work anymore but use as stop watch for my exercise. These watches can take a beating but continue to run.
2,FOR THE SURFACE OF THE POOL - NOT THE DEEP END!,"This watch was fine as long as I swam on the surface of the pool. After 20 months I made several trips to the bottom of the deep end - 9 feet - and the slight increase in water pressure caused condensation under the crystal and I had to replace the watch with a 100 meter model. Other than this, the watch performed flawlessly."
4,great watch,I love this watch! it's easy to use and the numbers are easy to see.The only thing I didn't like is because the dysplay is not made of glass is a kind of resin instead which is easy to scratch.
1,Beware watch strap,"If watch band breaks, almost impossible to replace. Standard straps do not fit. Search Amazon yourself. Unless you can pay to have a watch band shipped from England, do not buy this watch."
3,Great watch-Sorry Band,"My latest purchase makes this the 5th Casio #W96H watch I have. I would not have had to buy the last three had the bands held up. The watch battery is guaranteed for 10 years- expect about two years max out of the band!Amazon's price was such a bargain that I could buy a watch almost as cheap as a band: $15 total against $13, and that's without S&H;! Such a great watch to be held hostage by a band- and I haven't found a replacement locally. The Casio website does have them, but the new watch is a much better bargain. Casio should include a spare band at no additional charge."
4,"""A Great Sports Watch""","It is a great sports watch for work and sporting activities. The only thing wrong with this watch is the watch band. When the band cracks up and it gets dirty, it breaks and you are so sad you need another watch band. There is no other way you can purchase another one. You go online to many different websites and they have other watch bands except yours. You can go to Wal-Mart or Target and they have their different watch bands you can purchase, but still you are sunk without a new watch band. I ended up purchasing this watch and wearing only to very important functions. Just wear your watch and wear it sparingly."
3,Performance Appraisals that work: features 150 samples for every situation,samples are very limited to specific industries. Uses essay style for reviewing
4,Pretty good start,"This book provides a pretty good start to most performance reviews. There are two types of appraisal assistance texts out there, the that has complete appraisal examples and the type that has useful appraisal phrases. This book contains entire appraisal paragraphs. If you have never written an appraisal before, this book is a good place to start. If you have some experience, you may be better served by a phrase book."
4,Johnny has to train his new puppy,"Johnny's new puppy is a lot of work. Johnny has to feed him and clean up after him. Johnny has to housebreak his puppy and teach him not to jump on the furniture or people. There are problems with Spot's chewing slippers and barking at milkmen. However, there are times of romping and rollicking with Spot that are worth all the effort. Lilian Obligado's illustrations, especially of Spot, are darling."
1,bench cushion,i bought wrong product. when i looked at picture i thought i was buying the bench. didnt care about the cushion. Now they have a cushion & no bench.
2,Don't know what this is,Not sure what this was bought for or if we ever used it. Not sure if anyone did so can't rate it
2,More Hollywood Boredom,Save your money...... There is more 'story' at the local laser tag establishment. The action sequences left me yawning. One has to wonder how these these movies get funded.
3,"Action Movie where ""Girl Gets Girl"" in the end: Not lesbo hard corp saves VP",This is your typical TV Movie. It is not top of the line. I still get laughs about the atomic hand grenades used in movies like these. Fact it guys about a 1/4 of TNT exploding in the open is not going to throw out a fireball and pick of 10 0r so men. They then get up and keep fighting.Not a hardcore lez dyke thing. Not a sex thing either. Orientation yes...naked women having lunch.. NOT!!! So you horny guys looking for titties etc....NOT this movie. A kiss twice that is twice in this movie is it.I enjoyed it. IT is available at so reasonable price. I may even buy one.I still laugh at the atomic hand grenades and other silliness.
3,Female Rambo kicks ass!,"I have to admit I bought this movie just because I was once in love with the stunningly beautiful Mariel Hemingway. Now 20 years later, she still looks pretty good and has obviously gotten into doing B-action flicks. The story is simple - Air force two, with the vice President on board, crashes on a tropical island. It's now up to the VP's bodyguard (Hemingway) to rescue him. But what they don't know is that the island is a training camp for a group of terrorists. The action scenes are not great, but acceptable for a low budget movie. The same goes for the acting. But overall a nice b-action movie, with the unusual approach of having a female (lesbian) heroine."
3,"On balance, not a bad movie.","Don't expect too much high quality anything with this film and you should enjoy the action.Mariel Hemingway could still turn heads and interrupt conversations just by walking in the room and Jill Bennett would get more than her wanted fair share of female attention!I reckon that it was the hope of the cast and crew that their audience would leave all sense of rationality and believability behind when they pushed the 'play' button on their DVD players. I wasn't expecting Academy Award performances and so found myself pleased with my purchase and a welcome addition to my 'collection'.One question I found myself asking throughout the film... Why was Jill Bennett wearing a nice bright 'shoot-me-if-you-can' RED shirt when all the other characters were suitably attired in camouflage gear?!? Again, leave your sense of rationality behind."
4,ALL I CAN SAY IS...,"...that the female lead (Mariel Hemingway) is my kind of woman: tough, resourceful and a competent warrior. She could cover my ""six"" ANY time!"
2,disappointing,The acting is fantastic by Muriel. The rest of the cast is poor and the plot is ok... The only thing is I kept comparing it to Personal Best
5,"Eva Cassidy, the best there is.",It is so amazing that one person can possess so much talent. Eva was such a gifted guitar player along with being one of the best singers ever. She was an artist who had such enormous depth. Imagine CD is a powerful soulful cd that everyone should own.
5,If you've been wondering what the fuss is all about,"Somewhere in Heaven John Lennon heard Eva Cassidy sing ""Imagine"" and, with a tear in his eye, he said 'Now THAT is what I meant to say"". If you are wondering what all the fuss is about...this album will let you know. If you hear a more plaintive version of ""Danny Boy"" consider yourself lucky indeed."
4,Imagine,Eva Cassidy's voice is appealing to me. I love her style and the music selections on this CD. It's too bad there won't be more.
5,Eva Cassidy Music,This is the second CD by Eva Cassidy and I hope to find everything she recorded. She left the world too soon but she left behind a beautiful voice.
3,"Sorry Eva, this is probably more of the trend to come","As always, you can hear the beautifulness of Eva's voice, but the recording quality is marginal at best.I guess it is expected that as the labels go through all of the remaining demos, outtakes, ruffs etc that the quality will decline drastically. I would only hope that BlixStreet does not continue to pull from repetoire you can be certain that Eva Cassidy would never have wanted to see the light of day not to mention being released globally.There is a point where the finacial objective will ultimately compromise the artist objective. If you (the label) believe that all of the material that Eva Cassidy ever sang on should be released to the public, than maybe you should think about offering it as a download instead of a revenue generator or better yet, donate at least some of the proceeds to a worthy cause that Eva might have chosen? It is one thing to continue a legacy, but to exploit it..."
2,Not as good as her other recordings,"While I thought a few songs were good, this disc just seems to miss the mark for me. Stick with her earlier recordings if you want to hear her shine. A tremendous disappointment. YMMV"
2,Voice: yes. Music: no.,"Eva Cassidy has a strong voice, with a softness as smooth as silk and an ability to writhe in anguish. I understand why she has fans.But I'm not one.In her albums Imagine,Live at Blues AlleyandTime After TimeEva delivers the same promising starts on every song. But her phrasing, particularly her use of volume, is too abrupt and broad. Songs sound bipolar, either stroking with smoky allure or punching with emotional angst. There ain't much in between. On the jazz classic, ""You've Changed,"" Eva invites in with a soft croon, throwing in loudness for emphasis at points that capsize, rather than rock, the boat.I find Eva's approach disjointed and undesirable in most songs. Then again, there are a few songs where even Eva's weak musicality can't crush a great standard. I'd nevertheless prefer to listen to another artist sing."
2,"Disappointing, for an Eva disk.","Don't waste your money on this one. Bill Straw must need to add on to his new house, because he is really reaching with this disk. Two stars because it's Eva singing and there are two songs worth listening to, but I think it's time to give it up. If this is an example of what's to come, Eva's parents should say uncle!"
2,Some tracks are tolerable,She reaches for some of the notes so that it seems as though her throat may pop out of her mouth. This is a very unpleasant sound to listen to. Some of the songs that are within her vocal range are ok
5,Imagine---A Spiritual Awakening,"I knew nothing of Eva Cassidy until I heard the first track to ""Imagine"" in an antique store. I had chills from head to toe and demanded to know who the singer was. After purchasing the CD, I could not stop listening, and immediately got online to purchase more CD's via Amazon. Eva Cassidy's voice is so riveting, so original, so stellar, that I can think of no one who even comes close to her. She ranges from folk in ""It Doesn't Matter Anymore"" to traditional in ""Danny Boy,"" and every note in between is a work or wonder. Though her life was brief, there is something of her very present in her CD's. And though some would think her story tragic, it seems to be exactly as she would have had it. The beauty, the spirit, the musical magnificance---is all captured in this CD by this beautiful soul.I would buy it 1000 times!"
4,The Wedding Party,A great movie with an early Robert DeNiro who's great and everything he does and this is one of the first movies before he worked with Martin Scorsese and became a legend in Hollywood so enjoy this Bobby classic
1,Tom Slade with the Flying Corps,"This book has a cc 1919 cc.Grosset & Dunlap. For you book collectors, this book is in very good shape except the first 10 pages are not bonded very well. Write idchrest@gmail.com if you would like to have it. I love old books so I buy them because I love to read them."
1,Junk,"Impossible to set up, sounds terrible. Get yourself a Squeezebox and a nice little pair of powered speakers."
1,Hard to set up.,Spent too many hours trying to make this work. I was told after all that time that it may not be compatible with my Dell Lap top.
1,Wrong eagle book,This was not the book I thought that I had ordered. I was able to return without incident. That is all that I can say about my transaction.
3,Happy with my purchase,"I revcieved the book within a reasonable timeframe, it was what I was after, there were one or two minor things wrong with it however nothing big.It would have been nice to know about the stickers on the cover before I bought it but they do not take away the content."
2,A book you can easily pass by.,"I have read several books in the Verbal Self-Defense series and in all truthfullness I must say that the first book - Gentle Art of Verbal Self Defense - made a terrific impression on me. Her subsequent books in the series were extensions on the same theme but one has to really look deep into the material to find even marginal benefits. I felt quite disappointed reading ""How to Disagree Without Being Disagreeable : Getting Your Point Across With the Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense"" I was expecting to see some concrete steps I could use in daily interactions with people but all I saw were trite explanations and a rehash of the earlier books."
3,Usefuk info but a difficult read,"I found the messages in the book to be very useful, but the manner that it is communicated to be labored and somewhat academic. Thankfully the book is only 170 pages."
2,"Some good tips, but not really enough","Not much to this book, the first third or so discussing the dangers of hostile language. I only found one or two techniques that were helpful. The dialog examples were a bit oversimplified and cheesy."
5,Elgin is Very Helpful,I've read Elgin's Verbal Art of Self-Defense a few times and How to Disagree Without Being Disagreeable is equally helpful.
4,95% of it is great!,"Great book if you're into the 12 Steps of AA (or NA, GA, etc.). Helps really open up and look deeply at steps 6 & 7 (a/k/a 'the forgotten steps'). However (to me at least), I think these are THE two most important steps in that these are when we REALLY start to work on changing for the better. Without God's assistance to remove these defects of character I don't think there's really much change to come about and 'If nothing changes...nothing changes' and you'll either live miserably, grouchy, and irritable OR simply go back to your drinking/drugging days eventually. Overall, a Great book. Some content (to me) was a little 'fluffy' and 'Dr. Phil-ish'"
3,Drop The Rock,"I have not received the purchase yet, but it is not the fault of the sender - my PO Box had expired ---- ooops: Please submit to PO Box 286, Belpre Ohio 45714...confirm please"
4,Great 6th Step work,This is the best 6th and 7th step material I've seen. I love using it as a supplement when I take mew people through 6 & 7. It's easy to read and makes perfect sense and stimulates lots of good discussion.
5,Who knew?,"Everything you ever wanted to know about the 6th and 7th steps, but were afraid to ask. For anyone who ever read, ""These are the steps that separate the men from the boys"", and thought it an overstatement. Its a bumpy ride, but well worth it."
4,"Not what i expected, excerpts not story or cover to cover read.","Not what i expected. these are short and staccato excerpts not a cover to cover read. I thought it would speak more to how one processes or ""takes"" the steps 7 and 8, but its more just little ""talks"" and stories. Didn't really like it."
4,Enlarging my recovery,"This book is helping me see steps 6/7 differently, enlarging my understanding of the importance, helping me see that these under-examined steps are not to be missed or underworked in a thorough recovery program."
5,drop the rock,A classic 12 step discussion of steps six and seven this book provides good insight into these frequently overlooked steps
4,Drop the Rock,Have not read too much yet but so far seems very good Coming up on 6th step and i am sure this will be VERY helpful when I actually get to step 6
1,made matters worse,I bought this product hoping to remove a body oils stain from people sitting on a very nice leather couch.The cleaner did nothing. Almost looks worse then before the cleaner. Would not suggest for leather furniture
5,boot care,"i use this in conjunction with the Bick's complete leather care (spray). the cleaner is needed on ""special"" real dirty occasions as the complete care product, regularly used obviates the need for the cleaner."
5,Worth it,Will help your leather boots last forever .... I use after the winter so my leather boots go away clean and protected for next season
1,"Gives ""classical music"" a bad name","This is the kind of stuff that's marketed as ""classical music"" or ""classically-influenced"" or ""Bach-like"" that gives real classical a bad name, and shows the people who say these things don't understand, and have probably never heard, Bach. Those kinds of accolates are what suckered me in to buying this when it first came out back in 1981. I was in eighth grade and had been listening to classical music for about three months, and I could immediately see these tunes had nothing to do with it. They are pedestrian pop songs. Instead of a singer or chorus, we have ""waa-waa""ing synthesizers, but these are simple tunes with repeated drum machine beats on a synthesizer, nothing more. If you play the samples here and you like this sort of thing, fine and good. Many people like Britney Spears too. But it's not ""classical music"" and does not owe anything to it. It may be part of what brought the likes of John Tesh and Yanni out of the woodwork, however."
3,Good . . . But Has Drawbacks,"The chair is very easy to assemble and attractive. In terms of appearance and quality you will get what you pay for: a mid-range glider. Unlike Amazon's picture, the back cushion does not stay all the way up. If you are over 5'6"" your head is going to be hitting wood. The glider also tends to keep you in an overly upright position--not exactly conducive to relaxing with your baby after post-midnight feedings. Ours also started clicking when we leaned a little to the side--if we lean over enough the whole chair falls over. However, with these issues in mind, it is a good glider, worth the extra money you'll pay over the cheap models . . . I just wish we had taken the plunge and gotten one of the 600 dollar chairs we tried in the store."
5,Could not live without this!,I literally could not live without this chair. It is very comfy and functional. Great for those late night feedings and for rocking and soothing the baby. It is a wonderful addition to any nursery or home. I am very pleased with it's quality & comfort!
1,See Jardine Complaints,"It was curious to see why so few of the BRU gliders had ratings compared to many other products on the site. After further research, I discovered a website dedicated to consume complaints on Jardine gliders. It is worth reviewing prior to making a purchase. http://www.deluz.com/Boycott%20Babies%20R%20Us.htm"
3,Just O.K.,"Tried this glider in the store on several occasions, but after purchasing it and sitting in it for any length of time, it hurts my back (and my hubby's, too.) The wood looks a little cheap and the bottom foam cushion has an indention from our backsides already (only had it two weeks). Better than most of the less expensive gliders, but if you're willing to spend this much (especially after adding the price of the ottoman, shipping, tax, etc.) consider investing in a better chair; I now wish I would have. On the positive side, it is light and was very easy to assemble. We're not totally disappointed, but not totally thrilled, either."
2,Nice looking but the cushion goes flat quickly,"I love the way this looks and it was great at first. There was damage on the base but we called the 1-800 number and they sent a new one (however it took about 6 weeks so we ended up puting it together w/the scratched one). It is very attractive and sturdy enough, plus the microfiber is easy to clean for the inevitable milk spills - the reason I'm giving it a low rating is the seat cushion. It went flat where you sit within a month. I am not huge or anything - to give you an idea, I was using it w/a newborn and I am about 133 lbs. I have not called to get a replacement but even if they send one I'm sure it'll go flat again. Although I'm not using it quite as much now that my son is a little older."
4,"For the money, a good chair for the nursery","I picked this chair because while I wanted a decent chair that would last, I did not want to spend the $600+ for the other nicer brands out there. The chair is sturdy, the cushions are comfortable and the wood looks nice and matches the storkcraft cognac crib and changing table that I have. My only complaint is the height (or lack of) of the back of the chair. I am 5'5"" and can lay my head back on the cushion, but my 6'4"" husband can't - the chair back is way too short for him. And we know from our 1st child that this is an important feature when you're up all hours of the night! However, we didn't think this was a big enough problem to return the chair so we're going to make it work. It arrived within a week of when I ordered it, in perfect condition and it was easy to assemble (ottoman was assembled as other reviewer mentioned). Overall, we are satisfied with what we got for the money we spent."
4,Nicholas Feast,"after a slow start, Nicholas Feast picked up speed and was very entertaining. I'll have to read more of the Gil Cunningham murder mysteries."
2,Endlessly boring,"The sub-genre of historical mystery is a tough nut to crack. The writer has to be careful not to drown the story with the details of the period, or color the characters with the too modern traits. And lets not forget the whole point of this genre- the puzzle.Pat McIntosh unfortunately fails miserably on all accounts. Far too many characters, the thick Scotish brogue, and realy bad dialogue. By the end I couldn't care less who kiled who and why. As a compulsive buyer of mysteries, I am stuck with two more hardcovers by this author. Serves me right."
4,the Nicholas Feast,"I enjoyed this enough to buy the next in the series. Some times the language is a challenge but over all thought the writing excellent and the characters interesting. I was guessing ""who done it"" from the beginning but enjoyed the twisted throughout..wasn't sure until the very end."
1,Don't read this book if you are looking for romance!,"This book was awful, half the words in the book were not even in the dictionary. I didn't even want to finish it beacause it was so terrible! This book is not even worth a star, let alone a good editorial review. Romance from haunting hearts have been great except this one! If you like the Haunting hearts series of books, I suggest the book by Sally Steward called Ghost of Summer! Really worth looking forward to! This book isn't worth anything, read Ghost of Summer!!!!"
4,My favorite conditioner.,"This conditioner doesn't leave my hair feeling overly plascticized or scented. It's my second favorite conditioner. My first choice would be the recipe Nature's Gate used up until about 5 or 6 years ago sold in the shorted but wider bottles. Alas, that is no longer available."
3,"Great Sound, But Broke","I got the 8000 version of this sub (800 watts) and the quality was amazing! I never turned the nob up past 5 out of 10 because it would make an earthquake! haha Anywise, after having it for about 2 years it broke. Warrenty just ran out like 2 weeks earlier, but Athena fixed it anywise. After about 6 months later it broke again. Now trying to find replacement. Bottom line it sounded awesome, but seemes to brake a lot. :/"
3,Transformers...MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE!!!,"I saw Transformers The Movie for the first time back in 1986...and I still remember that glorious day. I just love Transformers and I will always love them...the movie was really good...along with the 80s rock n' roll soundtrack. Beautiful animation and color and a good story line...the only disappointment was the number of Autobot casualties. Some of my favorites died or were seen again. Plus, so many Transformers were left out of the movie...other than that...I give it 3 stars...I still watch the movie over and over again...I watch the Beast Wars/Beast Machines series...I still collect the toys...what can I say? Transformers Forever!!!"
2,Fun for Transformers fans,"Transformers The Movie was disappointing to me in many ways -- the characters I liked from the cartoon were killed off in the first fifteen minutes to make way for the next set of toys. The script seems to have way too extraneous elements that have nothing to do with the cliched story, like the Quintessons and the Junkions. Unicron, the planet-eater is coming and chowing down on everything in his path. The only thing that can stop him is Optimus Prime's Matrix of Leadership. The movie never bothers to explain *why*. But after Prime dies, the Matrix ends up as a McGuffin of sorts until the resolution of the plot. Hot Rod, a teenager Transformer, who the movie plays up as a impulsive wildcard, finds maturity at the end not through his own means but by stumbling across the Matrix by accident. This movie did not satisfy me in any way, and in my opinion is a mockery of the Transformers. Read the comics. :)"
4,Transformers the Movie is the highlight of the G1 series.,"The first time is saw TF:TM I was stunned by all the new characters and the excellent animation.For kids under 10,it offers good role models to look up to in the ""good guys""-the Autobots.Children always look up to the good guys and follow how they act and mimic their demeanor. For any Transformers fan,loose or diehard,the movie is one thing you must see.There are as many unpleasant as fascinating surprises in store in the movie.Personally,Transformers the Movie not only represents the highlight of the series,but of modern animation as well.So many of childrens action shows today feature ridiculous and violent plots which are a waste for tv..I just hope that someone will bring the original series back.I loved it as a kid and I still do as a young man.It is childish,but a person to me is entitled to at least one childish hobby..Don't get too carried away,though!"
4,A Worthwhile edition,"I liked this version because it's easy to read. But, there are no scenes, only acts, as I'm sure the author intended."
4,Pretty Good and Moral,"The book was better then I expected. I had to read the book for school and I actually kinda enjoyed it. I got through it easily but it wasn't written badly. I thought the moral themes of the book and the courage of Saint Thomas was great. I enjoyed it alot better then the other book we had to read ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" which is filled with verbose babble."
2,"Auuughh!!! IF YOU CAN HELP IT, DON'T READ THIS PLAY!!!!!!!!!","I was forced to read this book for school. I literally fell asleep twice. It has good historical value, but why the heck would somebody read this for entertainment? I have no clue. (Don't tell my L.A. teacher Pamela Reich this) My best guess for the reason that people are still being forced to read this stuff is that we are still trying to understand it! If you are a teacher, please don't make your students read this. You may like it, but I can sure as heck guarentee you that your students will carry a grudge."
1,Perhaps the movie is better.,"""A Man for All Seasons: A Play in Two Acts"" was not my style. I adore plays, and this era in time, but this play disappointed me, and I'm disappointed that I didn't enjoy it, as I had high hopes. I looked at the play, as if I were to perform in it, and it did not strike my fancy. With practically no stage direction, and little direction of emotion, I thought to myself how I would hate to perform it. I do give credit for it being such a short play, when this time in history was anything but short and sweet. I do not recommend."
4,Errr... Let's Get Our Facts Straight,"The only thing I really have to say to people who read this play is...Do some independent research on Sir Thomas More, and you will realize what a skewed charicature of a man Bolt presents. In truth, More tortured protestants in his own home, and was a hot-headed, ineliquent brat. Not that the play isn't entertaining or well written, and not that I have anything against the Catholic church, it's just disturbing to see people say that this play has ""good historical value"".So read it and enjoy it... or not... but remember to always take historical dramitizations with a grain of salt."
3,Silence as one effective mode of communication,"Even for a woman infertility is a difficult topic to discuss let alone for a stranger about another man's wife. Sir Thomas More's profundity of agony surfaced when he spoke of birth and death in same breath before his impending death. But an unwary reader could have easily missed this passage. There is so much subtle nuiance of description of conducts and gestures packed in this short drama that I'd have to consider re-reading, seeing a play and a movie version."
4,"Good, quick read","I had a few hours in between flights this Thanksgiving and brought this along. It's considerably deeper than your typical airport reads, though since it's a play you can finish it quickly.Bolt does an outstanding job in the Preface talking about his motivation, his direction for the character and persona of Sir Thomas More. What's most interesting I think is how he handles the character development. I won't ruin it for you, but I think it needs to be said that this is not the story of a man changing because of events but almost the inverse.Language is very easy to read and understand, though some passages will certainly benefit from rereading just to consider what the message is, what Bolt is trying to get across. I loved the book and would love to see an adaptation of it."
3,PEPE,"I am an 11th grader and i found it pretty easy to understand. The facts were brought up well organized and although i had to read the book for a research paper, it wasnt bad at all since i understood what i was reading before i read it. I recomend that people should read this book and understand why Sir Thomas More was a Martyr."
1,Tower to rack conversin kit,This is not an HP Proliant G3 tower to rack conversion kit as it was advertised. So it will not work.
4,Perry's LA Deathrock days,"Perry Farrell, talent behind Janes Addiction and Porno for Pyros started out in a one off band from LA called Psi Com. My first reaction after hearing this CD was, ""Why didnt he stick with THEM!"" Personally, I like this album much better than early Janes. The music is moody, thoughtful, gloomy and just plain good. Very mid-eighties Goth/Post Punk sounding. It goes very well with Siouxsie's Juju album, PiL's Second Edition and Christian Death's Only Theatre of Pain. Perry, you should have stayed a Goth and left the funk punk to the Peppers!"
4,Pre-Janes Perry,"This EP isn;t for everyone but hardcore Janes fans will certainly appreciate the humble beginnings of Perry Farrell in this mid-80's goth/new wave quartet. While the tracks are definitely not radio friendly, it is easy to hear the early stages of Perry's genius when it comes to mixing a variety of musical styles. While the music is solid, it makes the listener appreciate the absolute brilliance of Jane's Addiction - both musically and lyrically."
2,Meh... Get this if you're a die-hard Perry fan.,"Nothing great here. Xiola might've been a good song had it been released in 1975.As the title says, only get this if you REALLY want to have everything Perry has ever done."
5,"""SUMMERTIME"" should be a single","I love the song ""Summertime"" by Fresh Prince. It's such a popular song that it should be made into a single."
1,Will Smith the King of Crap Rap,"You may want to brush your teeth twice after suffering through this bubblegum, sugar coated load of junk that passed as music. Will SMith has the talent of an ingrown toenail, but the sheep of America kept buying it up. I wish he had disappeared like Jazzy, but maybe we can watch Ali II someday and realize that as an actor and a rapper, Will can thank God everyday he was born in the USA where any idiot can milk fifteen minutes of fame into a lifetime."
1,Useless!,How pleased was I to get this series 1 dvd set in super quick time...great I thought! Only to find out that the whole set is in German only...nowhere did it say this was the case so sending back this and series 2 boxed set which I also ordered....so much for a Christmas with the Newcastle boys!! Given one star for the quick delivery time only.
4,Review of Goalie Pants,"This seems to be a good product. My son ordered them, but it's been so warm, he hasn't had a lot of game time to wear them. He did say they were very comfortable."
5,Need to brush up on your port?,"I'm relatively new to the joys of port wine, so when I saw this book I bought it immediately. I have not been disappointed. The helpful history, geography, tasting sections are relatively brief but interesting, and the review section is stellar. If you want to become an informed port consumer, buy this book!"
4,Best available book on port,"I've read the german translation of this port companion. It is very helpful and well written. Very good pictures of Quintas and bottles make it a joyful read. The author gives details for wines and vintages on most quintas. Maybe he could have given more comments on vintages on some quintas, esp. the high rated ones."
4,nice bike,"I just recently purchased this bike, first I must say that it is very comfortable. My husband did not have any difficulty putting it together at all. It does not take up much space and I enjoy the different programs. It does provide you with a very good workout. 20 minutes at level 6 the first day, really surprised me.My only complaint is that the pedal makes a knocking sound. Hopefully this can be fixed easily, as I really enjoy all other components of this bike."
1,Box Was Broken,"Unfortunately, never got a chance to test the bike. It arrived at the shipping dock so broken that I refused delivery. I read where a couple other reviewers experienced the same problem. Amazon might want to take a look at their choice of shippers for such items."
4,Schwinn 112 Upright Excercise Bike,"Good product for the price. Bike seat is a bit uncomfortable. A seat with more padding would be perfect.Adjustable positions: Seat height, seat angle, handle bars."
1,Worked for one week....Many have same problem,"I too read all the great reviews and was impressed with the Schwinn 112 (same as 113 without the fan). Then after one great week the console flashed the dreaded ""E-2"" and the bike no longer worked. Apparently many have had this error. I called schwinn they sent new console and cord about a week later. They say it could be electric and or the motor. Same ""E-2"" problem. So I'm back to contacting Shwinn again. I did some more research and found many have had the same experience with ""E-2"" error. When I buy a product I expect it to work unless it gets damaged in shipping. This sounds like bad quality control thats been happening more frequently. I wanted the bike for the execise, not for a ""get it fixed"" project. Be aware...."
2,Defective Part,"Like others who wrote reviews, we received this item with a damaged part. The black protective covering that goes over the silver bar that is the base of the bike, was cracked. I just left a message with customer service, and made it clear that I wanted replacement without cost. My fingers are crossed that works out! Anyway, the bike itself seems fine we just set it up, and I like the low noise factor and size is small and portable.11/2011Part was replaced-- works great! Very happy with the unit!"
2,"Great price, good sound quality, bad construction quality","I bought this ClearPro headset and a very similar Plantronics headset (that cost more) at the same time. Tried them side by side, and to my surprise, both the sound quality of the earpiec and the voice quality on the microphone was appreciably better on this inexpensive headset than the Plantronics one.However, I only got to try once: When I disconnected the ClearPro after this first test use, one of the two plastic prongs of the pop-port connector broke off. I suppose that we can partially blame Nokia for this proprietary and somewhat retarded connector style. But in comparison, the Plantronics version of the connector was much more solid.In general, the construction of the over-the-ear, mic boom, etc., on the ClearPro was all somewhat- to greatly-flimsier than the other headset."
2,"audio is fine, but has a short lifespan","The headset worked fine, but the pins on the connector snapped off after two months, rendering it unusable."
5,Comprehensive,"This book covers topics from A to Z. It's like an ""everything you ever wanted to know about addictions"" manual. I'm going to use it for one of my social work classes. The only problem is that there's too much material to cover in one semester. The postive side of this is that students can continue to use the manual while they're in practice."
5,You can't go wrong with Denon.,"This receiver is just about perfect, and when Denon came out with the AVR5800 they did achieve perfection. This receiver packs 140 watts per channel, every Dolby decoding mode known to God, Ray Dolby and man, a clean, ergonomically sound interface (no Tokyo Light Show as in other receivers and a pertty decent learning remote.The only thing I don't like about this receiver is the fact that it does not do high bandwidth (HDTV) component video switching and the tuner stage is pretty weak. But if you want fantastic, solidly built, expandable A/V gear then Denon is the place to go."
1,STAY AWAY!!!!,"After 1 defective drive and 4 coasters, I would say this drive has by far been one of the biggest computer headaches I've ever dealt with. It doesn't burn at 8x even with the appropriate media. If you are planning on backing up home movies, I would strongly urge against this drive as the backups I have made freeze at the 12 minute mark. Back to the store!"
3,"Ok, but having problems",When I put a DVD+R in the drive it takes forever to load and it hangs up and i have to keep starting the computer again. Packet Writing works only on DVD+RW and DVD+R it can't read the last session that is read and it reads as a Blank Disc.
1,Not Possible,One question:How can the reviewer from Michigan say that he has had this drive for a yr. when 8x burners have not been out that long ?
1,unacceptable support,"The purpose of this review is to inform customers of the poor service provided by I/O Magic. I had bought a problematic DVD drive. A technician suggested I acquire an RMA but subsequent attempts to do so were unsuccessful. After a couple of months of no replies, I decided to simply buy a new drive from another manufacturer which got rave reviews."
2,Driver Problematic!,"My Dell doesn't ""mesh"" well with DVD I/O devices. Although it can play movies, trying to burn DVD's on it is a hit or miss. Driver problems plague this device and there's no support from I/O. Name brand is the better way to go. Save your money."
1,Expensive Trash!,"I should've seen these reviews before I bought the drive. I still have not made one successful disc, but a lot of coasters. I'm willing to simply throw it away!"
4,Totally Fun,This book is so much fun to read that I have recommended it to several people who were curious about the Hamptons and they enjoyed it too. Why do some reviewers crab that it is about the rich and famous? If I wanted to know about the poor and aonymous I would just have to look in my apartment.
2,Too High Strung,"Philistines at the Hedgerow traces the roots of fabulosity in New York's most famous vacation spot, providing an insider's, gossip-filled look at the scandals and quirks of the area and its inhabitants. Gaines examines the relationships between property and personality that have developed over the years at the beachfront, from building castles to accumulating mass amounts of acreage where parties can be thrown and paparazzi shots can be taken. Philistines at the Hedgerow provides yet another glimpse into the celebrity backdrop of American life in an area that has radically altered itself over time from simple farmland to idyllic playground."
2,TOO MUCH OLD HISTORY TO HOLD INTEREST,I WAS EAGERLY WAITING TO READ THIS BOOK AND SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS ABOUT THE HAMPTONS IS. WHY IT IS THAT SO MANY STARS AND RICH NEW YORKERS CONSIDER THIS THE PLACE TO BE. AFTER READING THIS BOOK THEY CAN KEEP IT! IT STARTED OUT TO BE INTERESTING BUT EVERY TIME THE AUTHOR STARTED A STORY HE FELT THE NEED TO GO BACK IN HISTORY AND EXPLAIN THE ORIGINS OF A HOUSE OR A PIECE OF LAND. WHO CARES? I WANTED MORE OF THE PRESENT DAY PEOPLE AND GOINGS ON. I FELT MYSELF DRIFTING OFF EVERY TIME HE WENT INTO ONE OF HIS HISTORY LESSONS. GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL GAVE A MUCH BETTER JOURNEY TO A TIME AND PLACE AND WAS A LOT MORE FUN!
1,"Silly, spoiled, spendthrifts","Ted Dragon's story is the only highlight. Otherwise one feels almost sorry for the pettiness and smallness of these folks(but then you remember these people have BILLIONS of dollars). That whole Gardiner chapter was pathetic. Obviously, money doesn't always buy you a life!"
5,A worthy read...,"Everyone heads to the shore in the summer to play in the ocean and mingle with the rich and privileged. Open Gaines' book and discover the wonderful steamy, seamy side of that privilege. Just because someone has plenty of money doesn't mean that they have plenty of sense. Reading Philsitines at the Hedgerow is like peeking through a porthole into a first-class cabin on a luxury liner. One sees aspects of being rich--filthy rich--that one never expected. Gaines is a professional. His writing is beautiful, clear, and logical. His attention to detail is so obvious that no one would ever question his research. If you love detail, if you love ""real writing"", read Philistines."
2,wrist band,"Although they look very nice when brand new, the color (blue) fades dramatically after a fewuses of playing tennis."
5,Perfect Sense,"Why ""Senses Rising"" ? I keep listening, while at work, while at leisure, while travelling, and it helps me in ways I can't say I'm entirely conscious of. ""Mentally refreshing,"" would be an apt way to describe the music but that's too catchy. The music, tonal, melodic, is surprisingly *not* too catchy. Nor is it too Baroque, too Impressionistic, too Classical, too Modern. It's just as much of each of these as I happen to like. That's what I was secretly hoping for when I picked this cd up and I'm extremely pleased with what I got."
5,Weird but good...,"Yeah this album does sound pretty crazy, but it also is very good. Good vocals by Rozz and extraordinary lyrics combined with Eva O's guitaring, how could you go wrong? I have to admit,Eva O's songs are Not as great as Rozz's,and that is the only drawback about Shadow Project- Eva O wrote too many damn songs!I would have liked to see a whole Shadow Project album with all songs written by Rozz or him and Eva combined, but about half of this album is written by Eva O. But considering the fact that Rozz does vocals even for Evas songs is a real plus. There is also a cover of Bowies HolyHoly which is very nice. With all that said, this album definitely deserves 5 stars, and if you like Rozz,get it,or if you like death rock you must pick this up."
1,This is the worst CD I own.,"If I could give this CD 0 stars I would. I own over 600 CD's, and this CD is by far the worst one. When I first listened to the songs I thought it was some kind of joke. This disk isn't even good enough to be used as a coaster. Don't waste your money."
5,The press has always been anti-Christian.,"Olasky makes a very solid argument against the intrinsic bias of the owners and publishers of mainstream media. The bias is institutional. Part of the problem of the liberal elite is that they don't pretend to have neutrality, as they consider being liberal as a morally superior option. Easy to read, and recommended."
3,Here's What You Get,"Suicide is Painless is on the CD, and unlike so many other CD's with the song, this one DOES have the words! However, if you are looking for the version you all have come to love from the show MASH, you may be a little dissapointed. This version has an 80's rock band sound to it. Although not a bad sounding song, it was well done, just not what I was looking for when I bought the CD. If you want an electric guitar, more upbeat pace to the song, go for it, this is what you want, otherwise, keep looking."
3,nice enough but they don't match each other,"We bought 3 of these: a single, a double and a quad. The double and the quad match each other but the single is very different. Fortunately they are not right next to each other so we are the only people who notice it. Still it was a bit disappointing. I would think that when a buyer ordered 3 at once, the warehouse picker would think to match them a little better. Ah, well ..."
3,"Good story, but hard to watch for grown-ups!","Dot and the Kangaroo is the story of a young Australian girl, Dot, who is befriended by a Kangaroo when she gets lost in the bush.This movie is unique because only the characters are animated. The background is shots of real things, like Dot's house, a real forest, and a real stream.The film teaches good lessons about the environment, but some of the characters are hard to understand because of Austrailian accents or whiney high voices.The story is good, but the film is pretty boring to sit through. My 2-year-old seems to like it, but I can't take much of it."
1,A Disappointment,I guess I didn't remember the story like I thought I did. The color was faded and the story cannot compete with today's childrens' books. A child would probably be bored with it and not bother to sit through it.
3,Gave Me Nightmares,I watched this as a kid in the 80's and at the time I was confused by some parts and mostly scared. Growing up I have wondered if I will ever see this film ever again and WOW here it is on DVD. I think I will buy it but it may not be for every child out there as this darn flic still freaks me out and I am now 30 years old.
3,Great movie. But could have been better...,"I thought that this was a great movie... I watched it 3 times last night and cried every time... Could have been much better if it was a restored print. Even having some background on how the movie was actually done would have been neat to see.I thought that this movie was a brakthrough film long before Roger Rabbit. It was like Pete's Dragon in a way... An animal helping it's human friend get out of trouble...The scenes where she cares for the kangaroo were touching.. Even when the kangaroo went home I cried like crazy... It touches on feelings that people experience when a good friend leaves..I have fond memories of little Dot finding her way home and even after all these years, I still cry... Great little film, but it could have gotten better treatment on the DVD format..."
2,I LOVE DOT and the KANGAROO BUT...,This version by Digiview Entertainment is VERY POOR QUALITY!!! very yellow glow around the characters and the sound is muffled. I love the Dot and the Kangaroo. I was so happy that I found the movie but this was a disappointment. I watched the movie on YouTube and that was better quality than this version from Digiview Entertainment. I gave 2 star because I like DOT but the DVD is poor quality!
2,"If your children aren't saying things like ain't, gimmee, etc. stay away!","I really wanted to like this book, but I don't. He is writing to teach children not to say words like ""ain't"" which I would like to think most people don't say. He has a point with the word ""gimmee"" but it's pretty much the only one-- I made the mistake of reading it and my daughter never said that and now she knows the word.The rest of the book has simple conjugations-- I ran, he ran, we ran, I run, etc. that are not such an issue.The book we need is a book modeling interactions between people saying please and thank you, not a book instructing kids not to say ""ain't"".His other book, How to Behave and Why, is better, but still has that instructional feel which may not be the best way to get a message across."
5,How to Speak Politely and Why,"This book is fantastic! It is as timely today as it was in 1934. As a retired teacher I am delighted to see that grammar is taught in a fun, effective way. Everyone of my friends who have seen this book want to order it."
4,Speaking Politely,Good book for young children. It has become part of our night time reading collection.
4,"Complex, just the way I like it - but...!","I've been rather bored with books lately, there are too many that are too similar to each other, but this one really caught my interrest. It has an intricate, well thought-out plot, fascinating characters and a society which feels alive - but...! It left too many loose ends.So I went to look for information about this book on the net, and behold, there is indeed a sequel. Though I'm glad there's more, I just whish I'd known beforehand it wasn't a stand-alone novel since who knows how long before I get my hands on the next one?I truly recommend reading Palace, but make sure you have the sequel as well - this is a ""to be continued""-book in my opinion."
5,One of the best collaborative works I have read...,"Mark Kreighbaum adds some excellent spice to the skilled writing of Katharine Kerr. Many authors whose books I have seen in collaboration end up with fairly dull, long-winded essays through which I can hardly plough. This book is entertaining, philosophical, topical and techinical. I have recommended this book to almost all of my literate friends."
4,not appreciated,"Like George Harrision himself, this particular albums seems to get less respect in relationship to his entire output. Granted, All Things Must Pass and Brainwashed are his strongest albums, but this one is tuneful (more obviously so than other albums by Harrison) and more than a little fun. The song ""That's The Way It Goes"" has wonderful lyrics. Several other tracks are equally strong including ""Mystical One"" and ""Circles."" I like this work."
4,"Totally underrated! Nice grooves, great production, songs","Hari fan here! Okay, the man is lazy and admittedly needs Macca to produce him (and play bass) rather than that disgusting Electric Lynn Orchestra character (as in more recent releases). Anyhoo, this album rates in my mind as one of George's better efforts, probably as good as '33 1/3', and more uptempo than 'GH'. 'Wake up...', 'That's the Way It Goes', 'Circles', are all great songs. There's a bit of annoying synth and one oddity ('I Really Love You') but overall worth your entertainment dollar if you need that George fix."
2,The worst of the solo CDs,This is by far the worst of the Harrison solo CDs.Time has not been kind with this release with some tracks really not happening.The track 'I really love you' is truly awful.There are a couple of good tracks such as the Time Bandits theme and Circles.This is for die hard fans only.
5,TRACKS ARE...,"1. Evil Woman, Don't You Play Your Games With Me 2. She Came To Stay 3. Patron Saint 4. Ninety-Nine 5. Slow Death 6. You Got Your Head On Backwards 7. Memory Lane 8. Already Gone 9. That Aint Me 10. No Fun 11. Rock-N-Roll Revolution In The Streets Pt. 2"
1,Garbage,"This movie (and I use that term lightly) is a great waste of time. I watched it in totality and that's 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back. I have read the entire Deathland series - twice. This dreck has nothing in common w/ that James Axler series of the same name. The red filter made the outside shots unwatchable, and the poor acting made the rest of the scenes unwatchable. The script bore no resemblence to any of the books and the action was akin to all the clowns getting out of a car at the circus. God this thing was terrible. If you get this DVD somehow (and I hope you haven't bought it) it's only good to hang from your rearview mirror to keep off the radar. Please, please don't buy this crap. Spend the money on the book of the same name and read it - you will be much better for doing it. Don't waste your time on this DVD."
2,good movie but,"DeathLands HomeWard Bound movie is a fair movie but it left out to main people it left out Doc Tanner, and Lori Quinn they played a big part in the book but they where not in the movie and Krysty Wroth was good in the movie but her red hair was not seen doing anything in the movie when there is danger or not . And Jak Lauren was good in the movie but he wore a football jersey and had short curly while hair in the book he had long white hair and he had his jacket with throwing knifes that was not in the movie Ryan and JB were about the same as in the movie and book everbout else was the same in the movie like they where in the book so the movie was good butthey should had Doc Tanner and Lori quinn"
2,Deathlands wannabe Movie,"Being a huge Deathlands reader mark, I was extremely excited to finally see a Deathlands movie come out.But alas, it failed miserably on so many areas.Actually the actors who portrayed Ryan Cawdor and Krysty Wroth were good, and actually dressed and looked the part. The other ones who played Jak Lauren and J.B. Dix were terrible.Even with a low budget, this easily could have been a classic B-movie post-holocaust action/adventure movie. It actually showed promise at times, but failed miserably at its very core. Too bad. This long running action series could still be made into a hot Hollywood production hit if it were made right. And it actually would not cost that much to produce.But if you are not a harcore fan like myself, you might see it in a different light. As I can tell from some of the positive reviews here."
3,Read the book,I've read this book and many more in the series. I don't know why others in the series have not been made into movies. This movie followed the book somewhat but lacked the fire of the book. The movie was slow and rather bland. If you have a choice buy the book and not the movie.
1,You will want these two hours back...,"EVEN if you are a big fan of the series.IF you take a flyer on it, as I did as a Vincent Spano and Traci Lords fan, this will be one of your regrets as you take your last breath.Still, if you like Spano or Traci Lords, it is interesting to see them. Spano spends most of the movie in a full length brown leather coat that had more of a pimp dressing gown look than anything approaching Keanu Reeve's. Traci Lords WAS scary but then I think we always knew that. Jeny Lano was at least eye candy in a yoga tube halter, but that was all the skin you ever imagined in this could-have-been.Best to wait for a solid REDO. Rated ONE so YOU don't waste your $1 plus shipping."
1,Homeward Bound,"This is the bottom of the barrel for ""B"" movies. It doesn't come closeto the acutal book by Axler. Whoever wrote the screenplay should findanother occupation. None of the actors come close to representing whatthe lead characters actually look like or act like their respectivecharacters in Axler's Deathland series."
1,CD HAS UNREPORTED LIMITED USE &,"BESIDES THE COMPANY BEING CHEAP AND LIMITING HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN TAKE THE TEST (FLASH CARD INGESTING) YOU ARE NOT INFORMED OF THIS, TILL YOU OPEN AND USE THE CD. IMPORTANT CHAPTERS ON HOME OWNERS AND DWELLING ARE ILLOGICAL, CLUTTERED AND CONFUSING..AS ARE A FEW OTHERS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SOURCE FOR CONVIENCE IN LEARNING HAVING BOUGHT 2 OF THE COMPANIES BOOKS...BUT YES, IT IS CHEAPLY PRICED....VALUE???"
5,Good enough!,This book was purchased some time ago for an ex girlfriend of mine. She wanted to get her license and this was all it took. After studying the book for a few weeks she passed with no trouble. I have to say it was good enough.
2,Disjointed,Bummer of a book. Really disjointed writting. Sadly this could have been an Excellent book as gthe subject is really intresting
1,Walt Disney's Santa's Toy Shop,"I was very excited to see this book on the shelve I think it's great to see all those great drawings so big and beautiful, but BEWARE it is not the same as the little golden book. Monique Peterson re-wrote the story and unfortunatley she didn't make it better, it lacks the warmth of the golden book. To me it's like if they had taken the illustrations from Twas the Night Before Christmas and discarded the story. If you've never read the original Santa's Toy Shop you'll think this version by Monique is cute in a ""Barney"" kind of way, but for my money ,buy a used copy of the golden book it will be much cheaper and a lot more fun.BTW My parents only spent 49 cents on our copy of the book"
2,Disappointment,"I owned this book as a child and was overjoyed to find it for my child. But when I got the book home and began reading it, I discovered the pictures are the same, but the story is different. My mother still has our old copy, now falling apart from years of reading, and I was disappointed to find that the whole story had been rewritten. I don't think they should be allowed to use the cover and pictures and attach a different story just to call it the ""Classic"" edition."
4,Interesting peek into a different world,"I found this documentary interesting, but not particularly revealing. It's just an almost day-to-day account of whatever precedes the electión of a Mr. leather. Some skin and leather to look at...but notheing beyond that."
1,Abridged Version of Interview,"If you are interested in Buckley and Muggeridge and the question of faith, then this Firing Line interview will be immensely enlightening and enjoyable for you. And you should try to find the transcript which I have found in some of Muggeridge's books. Unfortunately, this DVD is an abridged version of the original one hour interview (which was presented after Firing Line was changed to a thirty minute format), and lasts for less than 30 minutes. It in simply incomprehensible that the original 1 hour interview should be cut into pieces like this, and it is for this reason that I give it the one star. The portion of the interview presented is great, but I certainly hope that future Firing Line DVDs have complete, not abridged programs."
5,IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THIS ON DVD!!!,"I watch this and can only think here's proof that the present is not always (or even often) better than the past. Compare this to any current talk show and you'll see what I mean. Truly, the fact that these are (finally) being made available on DVD is a godsend."
4,Light classical piano,"I've been enjoying this CD for some years. Following are the tracks:1. Ballade (1890), Claude Debussy2. La puerta del Vino, Claude Debussy3. Vocalise, Opus 34, #14, (1912) Sergei Rachmaninoff4. Prelude in B minor, Opus 32, #10 Sergei Rachmaninoff5. Trois Gymnopedies (1888) Erik Satie ""lent et douloureux""6. ""lent et triste""7. ""lent et grave""copyright 1983American Gramophone AGCD-371Performer: Jackson Berkey, pianist playing on a Baldwin SD-10for those of us who care.There may be better recordings of this music out there but I've enjoyed this CD for years."
5,"fun, fun, fun!","the playground was delivered in a timely manner. There was very little helpful in both the written assembly directions or the pictures. If you really want to see what good directions are, look at a manual for a John Deere Lawn Tractor!We did get it put together though and our grandson loves it."
2,Sorry just doesn't do it for me ...,"This book has all the appearences of being a Harlequin type romance novel that no one wanted to publish. Why, well first of all the supposed religious retreat is called 'Heavens Gate' and those of us that are familiar with the real Heavens Gate thing in the usa with DO and RE and MI, the leaders brings visions of simpleton idiots that were waiting for their spaceship to come. Nothing and I mean NOTHING erotic about that, matter of fact, every time I read the reference to Heavens Gate it jerked me into a reality I hope to escape from while reading an erotic book.Contrary to the main Black Lace themes of strong women taking what they want out of life, the heroine in this book, Mary Grace, does little to show any strength and is a far cry from other heriones in the genre. I gave this book two stars, rather than one, for the inclusion of Yu Ling, the politically correct and currently necessary Oriental young girl in the midst of a tryst...."
1,GETTING WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"THE ITEMS WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT. I CHOSE PVC MATERIAL TO STAND THE TEST OF TIME. THESE CHAIRS PROBABLY WONT LAST A YEAR INDOORS, LESS OUTDOORS. THE WEAVE STRANDS WERE LOOSE AND UNRAVELING. I HAD TO LIGHT A MATCH TO MELT THE WEAVE IN ORDER TO SECURE THE STRANDS.THERE WERE SHORT STRANDS STUCK INTO ENLARGED SPACES. NOT A GOOD BUY."
5,Aerobics Calvino Dining Chairs,"These are by far the nicest outdoor chairs we have ever had. They are comfortable and beautiful, looking like wicker. Easy to clean too!"
5,EXCELLENT - A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!,"Summary: EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is a WONDERFUL movie, it is a historical glimpse on Lebanon, 1975, through the eyes of a teenager. If (usually) U.S. citizens ask themselves ""how can ""those people"" live in ""those countries""? This is the perfect answer to it. When you have a LIFE, FRIENDS, FAMILY, when you don't believe that things can be changed, when life is LIKE THAT, you accept things that you cannot change.The protagonist (EXCELLENT actor Rami Doueiri) goes through life as a happy go lucky teenager, used to living under such political changes, but untouched by them. In this movie of ""coming of age"", you can follow him in his seamless transition into adulthood: the realization of what life has became.PLEASE DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE - IT IS A MUST SEE - from any angle that you may want to look at it. You will gain different undertanding of things that you probably had before, if you are not a citizen from Lebanon, watch it and learn something."
4,Allons enfants de la patrie...,"Finally there is something we can call cinema , from a lebanese director. I was 14 when the war broke out in Lebanon , and the film best achievement is to try to bring into images that state of mind of gradual descent into chaos , while everyone thinks and acts as if nothing is happening : that is the real tragedy (and ? blessing) of Lebanon . I wish we saw more , through the cameras eyes , I wish there was less foul language in this film so the younger people can see it ..nevertheless this is a work made with a lot of talent , heart and humor , and for this Mr Doueiri deserves appreciation and acclaim."
4,Better than average compilation on the UFO phenomenon.,"I would suggest that anyone, who is new to the investigation the UFO phenomenon, should view this set. It proposes an interesting viewpoint on the UFO and alien abduction phenomenon, along with interviews with the people claiming to have been abducted. Some of the footage is subtitled, but it is gripping for the new-comer to the field. Good footage of UFO's. If you want to introduce a non-believer to the fact that UFOs are visiting this planet, this is a good way. If you like this, check out Hoagland's Mars V. 1 - The NASA/Cydonia Briefings (1993)."
3,"Walter Durantyu's book ""I write as I please"" is more than a mere whitewashing of Communits Russia.","This is a surprisingly well written account of a Soviet sympathizer's adventures from the first to the second world war. I didn't expedt to like it, and the pro-soviet slant is obvious, but the account is neverthelss iteresting and vivid and very much worth reading. I purchased the book through Amazon."
5,Underrated gem,"This is a powerful album by a woman who sings with urgent emotion and technical prowess. Technically? Her phrasing, her dynamics, use of flow and staccato, her rhythm....perfect. The song performance is poignant and clearly inspired. Joan is a great songwriter, let's admit it, right in there with Joni and Sarah Mc. But hers is the voice of the wounded victim and you believe her, but she is strong and resolute. I get chills from some of these tracks...Willow...this album IS the soundtrack to my life circa 1990 - 1993 Oregon...ah, youth! Anyways, if you like the crystal clear production quality of say a Donald Fagen or an Oliver Mtukudzi, you'll appreciate the production here, from the 70's? but really nice. This is an album for the highway or the boudoir, in my opinion."
2,"Terrific, then it snapped","I really liked this tripod, especially the leg locks and how smoothly it all worked. Then one day I went to fold up the crank handle and it snapped off in my hand. This is a plastic-welded-on part, non-repairable. The tripod can still be used, but the elevation must be accomplished by man-handling the vertical column without the crank (jerky adjustment) and then cinching down the lock collar. Pretty disappointing, because I didn't put that much force into it. Might as well buy the one without the crank."
5,fantastic!!,the tripod is all that i expected and more :) it seems very durable and i look forward to using it. It extends to quit a tall height and i love the 3 way pan had. BUY THIS ONE! its great for the money
5,Great product and multi uses,"I purchased this product to help my grip with the fitness pole. I am so impressed and will definately be buying this product again. It works great! It doesn't transfer onto to pole, and doesn't dryout my hands. Not to mention, you need only a small amount. My husband even uses it for softball and rock climbing. I have my friends hooked on it too...drumming, softball, golf, baseball, rock climbing, weight lifting, tennis, etc. A multi-purpose use that works great!"
2,"Happy Birthday, Dear Jesus.","This is Mojo Nixon's Christmas album. He got together with his band, The Toadliquors, and recorded some Christmas songs. Unfortunately, he didn't bother to learn the lyrics to any of the songs, just relying on his rather poor memory. He often forget the words and just sings whatever dirty words pop into his head. The whole album is very sloppily played. But that's Mojo for ya."
3,"Great Rear speakers, OK Center Channel","Bought this system used so take this review with a grain of salt. .... The rear speakers produce great, clear sound. The center channel is not quite as strong, as it is kind of ""tingy"", but given it was used, you can't expect too much."
4,A good book for a rainy day.,"This novel covers the campaign in Gaul. It is mainly written from the point of view of a new recruit. The historicl and social aspects of the time are nicely captured, despite some stylistic problems. I liked the book and still read it from time to time. The follow up novel ""The bloodied Toga"" is unfortunately unawailable."
1,Be careful when purchasing this item!,please make sure the shipper of this dvd sends you the right copy which should be a double dvd w/both Man on Fire & Courage Under Fire. I was sent the dvd w/only Courage Under Fire...Shipper has not called me back to send a new dvd plus is cost more to return the dvd then what it's worth.
2,Looking for JJ,"This book from my collection of books named after family members. It wasn't about the JJ I know, as I first thought it might be.I thought the book was rather interesting, but it was written to a junior high level audience; except, some of the content seemed a bit beyond that age group (but not as bad as some TV). And some of the behavioral patterns of the main character just seemed to be inconsistent---being such a caring person, then such a jerk. A single event in JJ's life destroys her childhood, then she is reformed; but she can not get her life back.The story seems to be telling young teens that mistakes in life can be forgiven and won't destroy you, so get back on your feet. While at the same time, it seems to be telling young teens not to make a mistake because your life will be ruined forever, and you will need to live in obscurity. Best just to skip teen years."
2,Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2,"First must say all the raves you see are from professionals that have used other systems and maybe good friends of the author, as some of the reviews said, mistakes, no clear definition of way to go, confusing, believe the author once sent me an answer to a question stating he has condensed a book of 950 pages into this, Well unless your an photographic, or layout person, this book too confusing for someone starting out, I would not recommend this book to first timers"
1,Not Organized.,"There might be a lot of good stuff in this book, but the author doesn't have the skill required to organize it into something useful. A lot of the stuff on the cd simply won't work on my computer, which is a pretty common Windows Pentium. Instead of writing about Elements II the authour should be reading about how to write."
5,Praise,"I have nothing but praise for this densely-packed book. Seek and ye shall find! The information level is as comprehensive as one could wish: Beware though, very few empty words, read carefully! Providing the hidden elements for Photoshop Elements users is an invaluable attribute.Use of these tools brings us into the realm of the full-fledged Photoshop. Thanks, Richard Lynch!"
3,HIdden Power of Photoshop Elemsnts 2,"Although there is useful information in this book, there were times when I just could not follow the instructions and even found some that were not complete, there were missing steps. Other times I found that there were no examples for what the author was talking about and I was left in the dark. I keep trying, but I always end up with a headache trying to figure out what the author is talking about."
5,Jazz Kafe Jams!,"This is what poetry in the new age should be about! From Kwame's mic check introduction to Tony Medina's Poem about Lieutenant Uhuru's Brother this is an addition no matter if you are still swinging from the spoken word tree or a diehard poet that just likes to hear the words from time to time. This will quench and make you proud to be a poet. My favorites among the entire offering are ""Hardcore"" makes you think and say Amen! Kysha Brown's ""A Letter To Myself"" will make you signify. Ras Baraka's ""An American Poem"" will definitely get you snapping your finger and wanting to also hear An American Poem. ""How Ethelbert Got His Groove Back"" is all of that. Yes, the entire CD from start to end is ALL OF THAT. Proof? I was given the first copy as a gift and purchased a second copy to have just in case!"
4,My 3 year old loved it.,"My 3 year old enjoyed all of the activities, including the stamps and stickers and the cool crayon that holds 5 colors. The book is full of color with decent activities. I just wish there were more activities in the book; it's only 32 pages long."
2,Drawing book looks more like a porno mag,"I recently bought this book, and while it does have some decent general information on drawing the female form (assuming you can draw all ready) I have to say it's pretty graphic, practically all the female models drawn are either topless or in some stage of undressing (with detail).There's even parts on how to draw adult sex scenes.(though no more detail than all ready stated...thank god)I definitely wasn't expecting that!It goes w/out saying it's definitely not something I would want to have out where anyone else can see it."
1,"Deceptive Title, Lewd Content","Purchased this book because I've been impressed with others from the series, though the subject matter for most of the other titles I've purchased has been more of a kids style anime, like giant fighting robots and pet monster stuff. Figured I'd try and flesh out my collection, so I bought it, think it would be like some of the other series I've purchased and discuss the methods of how to draw the female form in an appealing way.But when the book arrived, I opened it up and found an basic discussion of how to draw sex and masturbation. None of the preview material I viewed on Amazon mentioned this part of the book. Found out afterwards I should have read the customer reviews. This book was disappointing, and I would not recommend if for anyone, and definitely not it's target audience of 13-18 year olds. Its just misleadingly designed, and should have been more appropriately marked."
2,Caution - Not manga in this book,"I recently ordered (and returned) this book. As the title and cover art would suggest, this is a Manga drawing book. However, when it arrived there may have been one or two pages of actual manga drawings. The rest were drawings of old classic cartoon style work to something you'd see in a Batman comic book. If you're looking for a book on improving your manga artwork, then I would not recommend this book."
3,not bad for a starter,"I have several different books of Manga drawing, some great and some not so great. I put this one near the upper third on that scale. Not much in the way of new techniques or insights, but solid stuff never the less. I would say if you can get this book for a good price (under $13 or so) it is worth the investment."
2,It's certainly mature but not much use really,"While I did read this books previous reviews I still found myself quite surprised by it 's content; along side frequent nudity it contained groin shots, a chapter on drawing love scenes and even a short bonus manga about a couple having sex complete with mosaics. It's worst quality however is it's art which I would most certainly not consider to be above average but in fact amateurish at best the only time it really shined was in it's chapter on faces."
2,Cayman Diving,"This book is interesting, but you need to know that is was written before the last Hurricane and not all of the same spots are still there and information about the island has changed."
2,Not good for snorkeling sites,"I bought this book with the hopes of learning about good snorkeling sites at Grand Cayman. I wanted information so that I could decide what places would be worth our time and would be okay to take our 9 year to (as well as a map of the location). I was quite disappointed. It describes numererous dive sites and gives a ""star rating"" for snorkeling of these sites. However, it does not really address snorkeling individually. There are several well known snorkel sites that are not even mentioned in this book. Thankfully, I learned about these sites over the internet so that we can enjoy them during our stay. This book did not help me prepare at all. I imagine it is good for those who dive though."
2,Product was not what I ordered.,"Unfortunately, the product delivered was not what I ordered. I was disappointed upon arrival- only 1 container of fructis gel arrived not a 'pack of 6' as indicated."
1,The price of the product,I was looking to order this product but after reading the reviews there was a change of mind. A 6 pack would have been OK for the price but almost $50.00 for one Garnier is ridiculous. Is this price correct????
5,batcat,original batman the purrfect crime book from 1991 is the best batman children's book ever. it was the batman book i aways wanted when i was a kid. its base on batman year one but for all kids. i know any kid who loves batman and catwoman and pets would love this story.purrfect original art work. all i could say is i love it.
4,Exit Station to paradise,"Nous voici... Des milliers d'artistes sortent des nouveaux disques chaques années, sans vraiment trop récolter de succès. Malgré tout, ils continuent à faire de la bonne musique. C'est le cas de l'australien Alex Lloyd qui vient de faire paratre sur étiquette EMI son deuxième opus Watching Angels Mend ici au Canada. De la fabuleuse et nostalgique à la tragique Green, vous passerez un agréable moment en écoutant le disque de LLoyd. Passant de la pop britannique (Amazing) au courant plus alternatif (Lost In the rain) à l'acoustique (Exit Station), cet album vous en mettra plein les oreilles. Si vous aimez John Mayer, Rufus Wainwright ou encore Radiohead, cet album est pour vous."
5,"Finally, a CD worth every penny I paid for it!","I was dumbstruck to hear such a great CD with a mixture of sounds ... very different than anything I hear on the radio today. And it's nice to listen to a great voice from outside of the U.S. I wholeheartedly recommended this album to everyone I know, and I am without a doubt that everyone will love it as much as I do! It's rare to find a CD where every song is worth listening to. I am highly impressed, and will buy his first CD just on the basis that it is half as good as ""Watching Angels mend, then it will be worth the purchase."
3,Good rock ballads,I am a new fan to Alex Lloyd but found a remarkable amount of people on Amazon liking him to classic ballad rock legend Neil Finn....I just want to make a point to let people know that no way is Neil Finn an Australian and Alex Lloyd only shares a somewhat similar acoustic/melodic sound as the former.Neil Finn like his musical brother Tim are New Zealander's and their music is essentially so. Crowded House was a partnership between Neil and two Australian musician's but that is about as Australian as Finn got...Let's hope this corrects some Finn and Lloyd fans out there - Alex has a good sound and Amazing is one of my most poignant of tracks..Marc ;)NZ proud
2,sweet face but no brain,"I loved the idea of the light. Big halogen with beautiful illumination, true color, nearly daylight. Great for color work and intense. The first one was fickle and constantly needed contact adjustments/cleaning. The bulbs get so hot that connectors start to get weird, oxidize and breakdown. Lamps go out/burnout/expensive. However the light quality is so good that the seduction makes you stick with it. I could not fix the first one again so bought another thinking improvemnets must ahve been made. Mistake. Threw it away after 2 months. Went to a cheap but reliable bank of fluorescants. Bottom line; I loved her, but, she broke my heart."
1,Halogen work light,"Item came with bulbs already installed. One was broken and item needed to be returned in order to get replacement for the bulb. Second one arrived with another cracked bulb. In order to change the bulb, the light fixture need to be partially taken apart; the screws were difficult to reinstall as there was no room for my hand and tool."
1,Sorry Piece of Junk,"I ordered 4 of these lights to use in my sewing studio. It wasn't long before one by one the lights quit working. I have had them less than 5 months, and now only one is working. This is the biggest waste of money I've ever spent. Now I have to spend even more money trying to get some good lights that at least WORK!"
5,Exceeded My Expectations,"I have owned several Timex watches and have always been happy with them. They're good watches for the money. I ordered this Easy Reader watch because I liked the simple style of it. I work in a business office and the classic design of this watch fits great with my work attire. It's comfortable to wear and it's nice to be able to just glance at it quickly and read the time. It slides around a little on my small wrist, but I have yet to find an expansion band that doesn't. It's keeping perfect time and the date display is a nice little extra feature. I would certainly recommend this watch - not just because it's an easy reader, but for the nice classic design that works for both the office and casual wear."
5,Timex Women's watch T2H381,"Order this watch as a Christmas present, arrived on time and was what the ad said, mast of all a great price was great deal. Recommend it to all."
3,Beautiful Beast,"First, having very poor sight, I really appreciate Timex' easy reader watches, which can be read without being huge. I had my last one for about 10 years, and am only replacing it because the finish has faded, (and it needs a battery).This watch has a perfect face, for me. While I can't read the date, it's nice to know it's there, and it's good looking. Even my husband, who notices nothing, commented on how nice the watch is. (Boy, was I surprised!) Now for the beastly part. The band scratches and leaves marks on my wrist. Now, my wrist is NOT huge, it's 6 1/4"". The band isn't stretched at all when it's on. Timex did something very smart when they made bands that are easily adjustable. Unfortunately that left them with a rough finish. I'm thinking of exchanging it for a different band on a similar face.All that being said, it's kept perfect time for the two days I've had it."
4,Perfectly adequate,"I like the large numbers, the watch is plain, simple and is perfectly adequate if you are happy with just being able to see the time. Which is perfect for me. I don't need all the bells and whistles. A watch is just a watch. :)"
4,Only nit-picky complaints for this watch.,"It's a fine watch for the price. My only complaint is that there are teeny tiny little marks between the numbered ones, so small I can't even focus on them to count them. So instead of helping to know the minute, they actually obscure the fact. If there was exactly one mark per minute, or if the minute marks were a little larger, it would be exactly the watch I wanted."
5,"Gold silver, Silver gold ...","A nice watch to wear with both silver and gold jewelry. I know the style today is to mix metals but, hey, I'm old fashioned. I either wear all gold or all silver. This two toned watch with a very readable face works with either metal.Timex still makes reliable classic watches at very reasonable prices."
2,Great watch but can't read the date...,"I have a Timex watch exactly like this but I wanted one that shows the date of the month because I forget it without seeing it on my computer. So this one seemed perfect. It says it's ""Easy Reader"" after all. But when I got it and turned it on and tried it on, I couldn't read the date for anything. It was so disappointing. I returned it with no return changes and am now looking for another date watch on Amazon. Service has been great; very understanding."
4,Timex watch,"Order was shipped/received promptly. Nicely boxed & packaged properly. Price was excellent, below what I'd paid for the same watch a few years ago."
1,Timex watch,"The watch runs great, as is normal for TIMEX -- and I love INDIGLO. This watch was an exact replacement. However, I have a larger-than-average wrist, and this watch's band fits a bit more tightly than my previous watch, which was chosen specifically for the fit of the watch band."
5,Timex Women's T2H381 Easy Reader Two-Tone Expansion Band Watch,"I bought this watch at Amazon for my wife for Mother's Day. She loves it. I do also because after searching the Web diligently, Amazon had the lowest price AND free S&H! A great find for me and for her; she never takes it off."
4,Love this watch so much I bought it 3 times,"I do love the styling of this watch. I've bought it 3 times in the last 30 years except this time it has a calendar. I've road tested them in multiple adventure travel situations where other watches would have faltered and it spends ample time stuck wrist deep into my garden soil. People sometimes expect watches to last a lifetime but for the price, a decade is fine by me. And they never actually died by then - they would need both a new band and a battery and the price would be close to a new one. I have a small wrist (6 inches) so this fits just right but I if you're much bigger than that, I would be concerned."
2,Women's Easy Reader Much Smaller Than Led to Believe!,"I purchased this watch for my 84 year old mother in law only because it said it was 'an easy reader'. I read all of the reviews and more were positive saying that their 89 year old mother uses this one. Depending on someone's vision and gender determines if you can read this watch. It is totally too small of a face for a person with poor vision. The men's Easy Reader however has a much larger face and is more readable. I went to the store and looked at all the Easy Reader's after receiving this watch and all of the women's Easy Reader's were too small. So what it comes down to is this...You can buy a woman an Easy Reader and will it will be easy to read, ONLY if you buy her a men's watch."
3,So so,"It's certainly easy to read, and I love the Indiglo feature, but I've only had it a few months and the calendar stopped moving already. For the cheap price I can't be bothered trying to utilize the warrantee, I just don't depend on the date. Otherwise, it's fine."
2,So long as you are willing to throw it away when the battery dies,"I've owned this watch for about 2 years. Today the battery finally died. No problem, I thought. The number for the battery is nicely etched on the back cover, easy to find and read.Where the watch fails miserably is in re-attaching the back once you've replaced the battery. Unless you want to go to a watch store and pay extra $$ to have it professionally replaced, or have the specialized equipment and knowledge to know how to put the cover back on, chances are you will either break the crystal front or the watch entirely or never get the back cover back on properly. After trying to pressure it back on with my fingers, I went on the internet and found out it was almost impossible to do so in that way on these watches. Some success by others was had with padded clamps. I don't have those. I will not be replacing this watch with another Timex. I've always owned Timex (good price for decent quality) but this was the last for me."
4,Easy to read watch,"I find it easy to read, like the style in general, just thought it might be a bit smaller but all round the perfect choice for me."
3,timex watch,"Purchased for 97 year old mother as it had a simple, easy to read dial. Only problem is that the band is a bit large for a100 lb. lady and she has to wear it above her wrist."
2,does not have expandable band as shown in illustration!,"I am sure this is a great watch, however, I purchased it because of the expandable band shown in the illustration which it does not have, thus the 2 stars. returning for a refund"
4,Timex Women's Expansion Band Watch,I bought this for my elderly mother who finds it difficult to see the time on other watches.It is practical and yet easy to put on.Ideal letters that can be viewed without eyestrain.
3,Too Tight Expansion Bracelet on this good looking watch,"This watch is nice looking watch with a mostly gold expansion bracelet. I am not a heavy person, and my arms, wrists, are slender. I find the expansion bracelet to be just a little bit tighter than I would like it to be. I think it would be more comfortable with just one more link on it."
5,Great watch at great value,This is a great everyday watch. Inexpensive and reliable. I love the indiglo feature that illuminates the dial if you push the stem. Great at the theater or in other dark places. It has the expansion band so you don't catch the band on anything.
4,nice watch,Watch looks pretty much like the photo. The gold is a little brighter in person. Band is comfortable but a little large for my small wrist. Really like the indiglo feature and the easy to read face.
1,Title - misleading,"For people venturing into architectural visualization, this book is not for you. Not enough content for 3d modelling(building) and other architecture related stuff. I quite agree with the other guy that the title should be changed to 'Basic 3ds Max'. However, even this title is not appropriate since the author had not covered many important features of 3ds max. The exercises are so simple and won't help you very much in building up your confidence on 3ds max even after you finished reading this book. The book is expensive and lacks quality. I won't buy a book from 'friends of ed' publications anymore."
5,An Architects Tool,"This book is succinctly written and specific to the Architecture profession. The author thoroughly covers all pertinent aspects archtectural visualization-- written in such a way that is clear and easily understood.The author explains the best methods of performing actions and emphasizes shortcuts. The only complaint I have is that the book is black and white and sometimes difficult to see what he is referring to in the a few of the images. Although conceptually his explanations make up for this deficiency. Overall, this book is heads and shoulders above all over books on 3dmax if you're specifically looking for Architectural visualization."
2,Not Informative,"I purchased this book for a class and ended up buying a different one. It was not very informative, author mentions 3ds options by name but tells reader not to worry about them,and is horribly written with poor 5-9 step tutorials of how to click radio buttons or other worthless info. The book could be a third of its size if reduced to its worthy content."
1,A complete joke!!!!,"One of the worst series of books ever written, by a complete conman. Totally void of depth, imagination and decency. A glossy manual of aesthetic. Avoid at all costs, and that goes for the complete series. Why waste hours and hours of precious time with a man who sells the periphery of a densely complexed program. Miles short of any relevance to all serious students of architectural modelling. A complete joke Mr. Smith!0-stars!!!!"
4,Excellent for Architects and Designers,"I found that this book was written and ordered in such a way that made it very easy to work your way through 3ds max, build on your progress, and slowly but surely learn how to use the program. The book isn't extensive, but I feel that is a high point for an introductory book dealing with a program who's many features could be confusing to a novice. While I used this book as part of a course, I do think that anyone really interested could at least teach themselves many of the basics of 3ds max with just the book alone. I don't believe it will be the best book to reference back to necessarily in the future, but as a way to work your way through the program bit by bit in a logical progression, it certainly works well."
3,By if you are a beginner.,"The book is only for beginners, if you know your basics in max this isn't the book for you.Instead should look at the lighting and rendering books for max if you want your renders to shine."
1,Probably one of the worst multifunction printers,"This is a poorly made printer. The ink dried out in about a month and it cost about $40 each (yikes!) for replacements, one of the most expensive cartridges out there. The scanner does not feed photo correctly and it is very SLOOOOWWWW. There is also the problem of not having an off switch. Stay away from this printer!"
2,Disappointed,"I decided to buy the 470CX after carefully comparing prices and researching various places on the internet. I took note of everyone's recommendations and felt confident that what I would be buying was a quality machine. It has proven to be a disappointment. I used it for 2 weeks, and ran into so many paper jams, incomplete transmissions, and annoying features. I called Xerox tech support to see if I could turn the modem volume off or make it lower in volume ( the lowest volume setting is still very loud), but was told that there is not a way to do this, that I could take a piece of paper, fold it many times, and tape it to the side of the printer to muffle the volume.Whenever I received a fax, the machine would totally startle me as it prepared the paper tray loudly. I don't know how to explain it, but if you decide you want to buy it, you should have them perform a demo in the store!!!"
1,Cross your fingers every time you print,"This printer reminds me that my father always told me ""you get what you pay for."" This printer:1) Misfeeds constantly. The paper doesn't feed well, and when it does actually print sucessfully, it often prints crooked. I probably have trouble-free prints about 50% of the times I try. Cross your fingers.2) Has other problems. The ""ink low"" light is always on, even with a new cartridge. Also, the print driver locks up whenever the printer encounters problems.3) Is insanely expensive to refill.I will never fall for one of the cheap printers again. It is SO much trouble that I wind up e-mailing documents to my room-mate to print rather than go through the torture and frustration of trying to make a good print on mine. Don't buy it."
1,Work Center isn't so great,"Out of the box, it is a functional b/w fax, and a b/w copier. Once it is installed on the PC it is a decent quality, slow color printer, (5 minutes for 1 page). The Pagis software that comes with it is necessary in order to use the 470 as a color scanner or color copier. In order to get it to scan or copy in color, it is necessary to get into the BIOS setup. Not exactly plug-n-play. I tried using it with my gateway and dell laptops, as well as my dell desktop,(all less than a year old), so it's not like I was trying to install the 470 on an old or oddball computer. I kept getting port conflict errors or lock-ups. I never did get it to work well, and I returned it. I would discourage anyone from buying this product. The price was attractive, but it's not worth bringing home."
5,Not Perfect But very close,"Im wanted to respond to the review from Steven Strouth. He has mentioned he has jamming problems etc on his Xerox 450, but this is the Xerox 470. I actually work for Xerox and yes I'd agree the 450 does have major problems with Jamming. I currently have a 470 at my desk and have had it for over six months. It has never jammed once!"
2,Poor Quality..Bad Choice..,"I had purchased Xerox 470, and had to swap it back 3 times for a new machine from XEROX because the paper wouldn't feed without jamming or the rollers wouldn't grab a single sheet [grabbed 5 etc.] Each machine i replaced experienced the exact same problems. Furthermore the ink cartridges are a ripoff because they do not last long and even though there maybe ink left, once the machine says ""low ink"" you cannot overide and keep printing. I did find XEROX support good, however this product was so poor that i simply ended up giving it away to a charity."
4,Almost the best but the best you can get,"The 470cx is radiant in the multifunction marketplace. There are no competitors that rise to its adoration level. The built in 1200x1200 color printer rivals many other 'only printers on the shelf'. Setting the fax machine to auto/manual/telephone or dedicated fax is easier than most brands. The scan feature operates faster than expected and the print and copy speeds are faster than all of the nearest competitors. If you're spending $250 for a machine, dare not pick anything else until you've astonished yourself at the overwhelming features, simplicity of use and extended life cartridges the 470cx has. For the money (and believe me the features are top notch), its the best multifunction on the shelf."
1,Awful,"I have had this thing for three years. I have had several others and this is, without a doubt, the worst of all printers. The cartridges are ridiculously priced. The machine requires constant cleaning. It has now stopped printing black altogether and xerox help system stinks. They answer nothing.The machine is loud and jams a lot. Buy anything but this one. No more xerox for me or anyone that I know."
2,A few problems,"I have the 450 WorkCentre cp. The main problem I've had is the paper won't feed. The rollers won't grab the paper. Everything else about the machine is excellent, however this one problem makes the machine all but useless. I understand this problem is chronic on many Xerox printers and workcentres. They did fix it on warranty but now a year later I have the same problem again. The machine is really too big to enjoy sending it back and forth to Xerox although they've always been nice about it."
4,ENVELOPE PLEASE,"Great features and performance for the price. One problem, though. Can anyone tell me how to feed an envelope into the paper feed ? I can get it done, but have to reach far into the depths of the works to do it, and that is very slow and aggravating. There must be a better way."
3,Good Printing but could use extra help,"I bought this WorkCentre before Christmas & was happy with the printing and the fax worked great. The only problem is that there is not enough information in the book to tell me how to work the scanner or give me color copies. Now, we have problems getting a fax to come through. Also, the ink cartridges show 1/3 of the ink left, but it won't print. It costs over $... @ for new cartridges. If they go dry that quick, it is not a good buy. If anyone has any ideas for me, I would appreciate it. For the person who has trouble with the envelope, It takes practice, but it works great."
3,"Flash Cards, Not Help Sheets","These are well done flash cards by the same company that makes vocabulary cards for various languages. Unfortunately, this was not clear in the description - I mistakenly presumed they were large grammar charts. These flash cards are more useful for the advanced German student rather than the beginner."
2,Killer Market,"In this story Deborah is away from the farm, away from her family, away from her courtroom and OUT of her element. With so many characters and so much attention devoted to the ""strange"" Savannah, Deborah's strengths take a backseat. Among all the interesting facts about the High Point Market, Deborah is not the warm character I've come to appreciate."
2,It Was Okay,I have to be truthful I wasn't in love with this character. But parts of the book was okay. But the story drag on for too long. But the ending more than made up for the plot. This was not her best series. the ending was superb.
4,Always Entertaining,Margaret Maron is one of those authors that I purchase the book because I love her stories and writing style. I always have enjoyed the Judge Knott series. This story is based around the North Carolina furniture market and of course murder. The story moved along smoothly and was not predictable. There were many twists and turns and I was unable to solve the mystery. Worth reading.
5,Science as prop,"This is a sleeper of a book I was fortunate to run across even though it has been in print for some time. Hilgartner uses a dramaturgical model to help understand how science is produced both on the front-stage to the public and the undisclosed back-stage actions particularly of the National Academy of Sciences. Hilgartner provides case studies of diet and health issues brought before the National Academy of Sciences, complete with a metaphorical Greek chorus, scripts, and backstage maneuvering that contradicts the front stage picture we are led to believe. Anyone who has followed pronouncements of the Academy on such issues as perchlorate or other environmental issues will find this book revealing. Highly recommended."
1,Ozbo: do NOT buy from them,"I cannot find the link to leave the seller feedback, but need to warn you about their service. Ozbo failed to ship this rat bait for a week, with ZERO contact or notification. Amazon had to cancel this order. The product is great, but do NOT buy from this merchant.About the product: I switch up rat poison so that the rats do not become used to seeing/smelling the same food. This product kills them quickly, within a few days. Be wary of where they die though. They are dehydrated by these products and often seek water sources (bathroom, kitchen and outside.) If they die while seeking water, and that happens to be inside your house/attic, you must remove their body... otherwise the smell can be horrible. Also, as they decompose you will have maggots and flies. I don't mean to offend those with a delicate stomach, but you should be forewarned :)"
1,It does not work!,"This product supposes to kill mice, but it does not. I bough 1.75 pounds of this ""poison"" in the middle of June and started feeding mice in my garden shed. I started with one bar of Hawk Bait, but very soon had to increase the portion. Two and a half months later the bucket 1.75 Lb (!) is almost empty and I see more feces in the shed, they love that product! I keep only garden tools, a tractor and some lumber in the shed, nothing else. There is nothing to eat except Hawk Bait chunks. I'm not going to buy another 1.75 Lb of Hawk Bait."
4,Buddy's '91 Comeback,"Buddy Guy, with the able backing of Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Jeff Beck and The Memphis Horns delivers a great CD, that alludes to Buddy's strengths as a live performer. The soulful vocals and frenetic guitar work of this Chicago blues master shines on this CD. Highly recommended."
3,The price of commercial breakthrough,"Heavy handed production, erratic song choices, and guests who tend to obscure Buddy. There is some good stuff on this cd, but most fans of Buddy Guy will recognize that it could have been much better. It's a shame SRV didn't live long enough to fulfill his dream of producing Buddy's comeback-- it would have been infinitely better than this John Porter endeavor. Opt for the ""Slippin' In"" disc instead, with the great Johnnie Johnson on piano and Eddie Kramer producing."
5,Damn Right you're good!,"Buddy Guy is one of my all time favorites and Damn Right I've Got the Blues, is in my oppinion, his best work."
5,great blues,DAMN RIGHT THIS IS A GREAT CD.BUDDY PROVES THAT HE CAN ROCK AS WELL AS PLAY GREAT BLUES.I LOVE THE SONG MUSTANG SALLY.AND HIS ALMOST 7 MINUTE TRIBUTE TO STEVIE RAY VAUGHN REMEMBERIN STEVIE IS JUST GREAT.I THINK THAT THIS CD HAS SOMETHING FOR BLUES AND ROCK FANS ALIKE AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND IT.
3,"Damn good, for a commercially slick effort, HOWEVER....","If you want some REAL, RAW, Buddy Guy, get ""Stone Crazy"" on Alligator records. Yeah, Alligator records basically churns out cookie cutter blues, but this recording was purchased from U.K. JSP records and re-released on Alligator. If you want the real Buddy Guy, as he usually is when he performs live, get ""STONE CRAZY"". If you like clean, catchy hooks and guest appearances, then ""Damn Right..."" is his best work to date. Really all of his JSP recordings are great. ""Breaking out"" is more rock oriented, ""DJ Play My Blues"" is along the lines of ""Stone Crazy"" but not as good, and ""Buddy... Live at the Checkerboard Lounge"" is raw, raucous, and reeeally LIVE (You can hear drunks attempting to sing along with Buddy in the background.). To sum it up, ""Damn right"" is great, but if you crave more raw, passionate Buddy, look deeper. Hell, Buddy even does some great acoustic stuff (i.e. ""Alone and Acoustic"")!"
5,Awesome!,I did'nt buy the game but I'm planning to depite what the 12 year old said. I don't think the weight of Raven is the point. If you don't like Raven that's fine with me but you can't change my opinion and I think Raven is GREAT!!!!
5,My FAVORITE game,"That's So Raven 2 Supernatural Style is a REALLY good game. I would recommend it to all my friends and family, and anyone who is a fan of the show. My friend Kylie keeps asking me if she can borrow it because she loves it so much!!!"
4,cool but im stuck,"Ok I have this game and its fun but the graphics arnt that great. I am stuck in the mall. I have purchased the ticket for the concert but I can not find a way to get to the floor with the vision peice any pointers, please?"
1,THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD!!!!!!!,i did not yike this game ever. ever ever because it makes me throw up. raven every time i play it it it makes me not good. raven once told me about this. simple thing is that i just don't get it. no one does. PLEASE POST THIS REVIEW TOYS R US !(...)i want to warn other people about this game it annoy s me the games are boring plot is not good like who game up with this game it doesn't make sense why people like this i either poop are go pee every time i play with it or like i said it just annoys me i hope people understand what id go threw every day i am five years old and no one understands why i don't like it i keep telling them what it makes me do....... please know that raven does what no one knows about the game is easy although it doesn't really do anything it doesn't teach me anything it can be finished in five minutes can me easy or hard mostky boring gotta go poopies (...)
5,OMG! IT IS SO FUN!,"I got this game a few days ago, and I have been playing it all the time! This game is hard, but really really fun~ I won already, but I started it over! LOLGreat for older kids, who love the show! *****FIVE STARS!"
2,stuck at the zoo,i like this game and i find that i played this game alot but im stuck at the zoo because i cant catch the monkey other than that its a fun game but if i knew that it would be dang near impossible to catch the monkey i wouldnt have brought it
5,Safe and Fun,"Among all I looked, this climber is the best! It is big enough for my 2 year old son to enjoy for another few years, and yet light enough to be moved aside when the lawn needs mowing. But the best part is that the platform is surrounded all sides which prevents kids from falling.It took me and a friend about 25 minutes to assemble it. Once put togdther it is hard to be taken apart, and can hold up to 100 pounds. It is fun and more importantly, safer than most others. My son loves it and I love it, too."
4,Mariam,This replacement was exactly what was needed and fits the coffee maker well. The suggestions for protecting this caraffe should prevent us from breaking the replacement. The price was very good.
3,Replacement decantar,"What can I say? Buying this replacement decantar prevented me from having to buy a whole new coffee pot. But if I could redesign a replacement, I would make the opening wider. I can't even fit my hand down into it when I'm washing it. The opening is way too small. Also you have to pour slow or coffee leaks out onto the counter. When I need a qucik kick of java in the AM, it tends to be messy!"
5,Mr Coffee,I was very happy to find this replacement pot at the price I got it for. It's the same as the one that came with my coffee maker and it works very well.
2,Breaks easily,This is the second replacement I've had to order for this coffee maker. The first broke when I hit the side of the sink while cleaning. The second broke when I was cleaning it with a long-handled brush. It never should have broken so easily. Do they not expect me to clean it? Jeez!
3,not quite the right size,"This looks exactly like the pot I bought it to replace but the plastic ring around the top is ever so slightly taller, meaning that in order to get it into the coffee pot you have to kind of jerk it into place and it does not pull out smoothly either. No impossible, but annoying."
4,Works,"This works with my coffee maker. It is not the best design - coffee and water get trapped below the black ring on the inside, so that you have to turn it completely upside down and move it side to side to totally empty it."
3,Be careful-very fragile!,Had to order this because my husband has already broken two by just simply washing them. This item is very fragile!
2,Breaks incredibly easy,This is my second and final replacement I will be ordering. The original one broke so easily after bumping it on the side of the sink while being washed. Since my machine had only been in use a few months I decided to just order another one. Here I am just over two months later ordering another because it was cracked after it bumped into a coffee cup when it was being picked up from the drying rack! I'm hoping #3 will last longer because I cannot justify the increasing cost to have my current machine. Terribly annoying as I've tried to be extra careful with it. The glass is just terribly thin and as others have stated water and soap suds do get caught up inside the black ring that surrounds the top. It requires extra rinsing and some interesting maneuvers in order to get it all rinsed out.
2,Mr Coffee Replacement Decanter,This pot only lasted a short time before the handle came loose therefore making it unuseable.According to some of the other reviews this is a ongoing problem with this product.
5,"great solution, simple and quick",This coffee pot was priced below discount stores in Santa Rosa. It arrived right away. I am back into my Morning brew and happy about it.
2,More like Mr. Dribbles...,"Like many of the other reviewers, I purchased this because the old pot was dribbling nasty old coffee and/or dishwater out of the front under the plastic rim. And like many of the other reviewers noted, the new one did the exactly the same thing. The new one actually leaked much more than the old one did.I also noticed that the handle seemed a to be attached a little more loosely than the old one. I removed the little plastic cover near the top of the handle, took a screwdriver, and tightened up the screw that was inside. This seemed to alleviate almost all of the dripping. I still get small drips, but at least most of the coffee goes in my cup now. Just be careful not to get carried away when tightening the screw, as you could break the glass."
2,Soap in your coffee,"As at least one other review mentioned, this pot has a design flaw. When you are washing it, soapy water can get trapped in the upper rim unless you're extremely careful about rinsing it out. It also pours badly."
2,Junk,"This will be my 2nd replacement decanter for this unit,as the previous 2 have both cracked. Difficult to clean and very fragile. I would not buy this coffee maker again."
3,Fragile. Handle with care.,I got this about 2-3 months ago and now it's broken. I was washing it when I accidentally bumped it onto the sink surface. Crack. Now I am ordering another one.Handle this one with care. It breaks too easily.
5,Fits my coffee machine perfectly!,"After my Mr Coffee carafe broke, I initially bought a generic replacement carafe at my local hardware store. According to the box it came in, it was supposed to fit my Mr Coffee coffee maker. It didn't. I returned it and ordered this one and it fits perfectly! I also think the plastic rim will make it a more durable carafe than the generic carafe that didn't have a plastic rim. Cheers!"
4,Great Replacement,"My husband decided to use our original decanter for a french press and it shattered. The replacement is great!Just a note that it you decide to use an aero press with the decanter, you risk the possibility of the entire thing shattering."
3,Just replacing the prevoius one. Nothing special.,"The old one broke. After months of exposure to heat and cold, it cracked. So I bought a new one. Not much more to this story than that."
3,OK for its limited purpose,"OK for its limited purpose and a bit less expensive than alternative products that fit this particular coffee maker, but nothing distinguishes it beyond that."
2,Replacement coffee carafe,"It fits in the coffee maker but it leaks when pouring a cup of coffee or filling the reservoir. I won't waste my time next time, just replace the whole thing."
1,Did not fit my unit.,"Wrong shape, did not fit into my coffee maker, now need to return or give it away or trash it."
2,It leaks,When you pour it leaks! It matters not if you pour from the spout or if you pour from the side.
2,Leaks when pouring coffee,"The silicone that holds the black plastic ring at the top broke loose and now coffee leaks out everytime I pour coffee. It happened a month or so after I purchased it so now I'm stuck with it. I might try to fix it myself, but I'm not happy with this considering it is a Mr Coffee carafe and not a cheap knock off."
3,Just adequate,"I purchased this decanter as a replacement for one that I broke. This decanter is poorly designed. The opening is too small to make cleaning easy, and water tends to get trapped underneath the plastic ring surrounding the opening. The only reason I bought the replacement is because it was cheaper than buying a whole new coffee maker. If you are considering this coffee maker I would recommend moving on to another choice."
3,Leak drove me crazy!,"Well, after 2 years of nearly daily use my carafe broke. Reading the other reviews made me realize that I wasn't the only one dealing with the annoying problem of the water/coffee dripping from the rim every time you poured liquid out. I wish it wouldn't do that.... it drives me crazy having to reach for a rag every time I pour a cup of coffee!"
1,What's with this product?,"I must say, I'm extremely disappointed in this product. In less than 12 months, I've already had to replace the damn thing 3 times because the glass keeps cracking due to the heat. How can the maker fail to make a coffee pot that can withstand hot temperature? it's absolutely ridiculous. Couple that with the fact the rim is too small and it's difficult to get your hand in the pot to wash it out, and that the handle has been loose on all 3 pots, I can safely say I'm never purchasing a Mr. Coffee coffee maker again."
4,Mr. Coffee's Fragile Decanter,"This product is pretty good. The only problems are: the lid tends to be very loose and comes off easily, it is neccessary to completely invert the decanter in order to empty it, and it is extremely fragile."
1,Leaks all over the place and can't rinse out top ring,"I can't believe that one of the largest coffee maker companies who has been doing this for 35 years can't figure out how to make a decanter that doesn't leak all over the place when you pour. Furthermore, where the plastic meets the glass at the top is not sealed well, so you can see water, coffee, or soap in the little channel between the two. -You can't fully rinse it out, so you probably get a little old soapy water each time you pour into your cup. Gross!"
5,"The best ""pot"" you can buy legally.","I have a beautiful Mr. Coffee maker that I can no longer purchase. Consequently it is wonderful that Mr. Coffee still produces the carafe for the machine as I am very accident prone. This is the 3rd carafe in 3 years.Mr. Coffee ISD13 12-Cup Replacement Decanter for FT and IS Series, Black"
2,"well, I done busted mine","Fragile thing, this decanter. Mine got broke when I was swishing some ice around inside. The ice went right through the side!"
5,Coffee anyone?,Tough to make coffee with a broken pot so was happy to find a replacement on Amazon. Pot is identical replacement that fits the coffee maker as designed to.Would recommend
5,Coffee Pot,This is a replacement for the pot that was broken. It is completely satisfactory. It arrived very quickly.
5,Excellent reference for American mammals of the recent past,"This book has the most information that a paleontologist can find about North American mammals in one place. It is an exhaustive text book chock full of facts about all the mammals from that continent that have lived in the last 3 million years. As a layman interested in paleontology I found the book fascinating and easy to read. The book is seperated into two main parts: first chronology of faunas, and then than a discusion of all the orders of mammals , species by species. The book also discusses possible reasons for extinction. The only flaw in the book are some of the reasons given for extinction are contradictary. For example the extinction for the giant beaver was supposedly caused by competition with the modern day beaver, yet they coexisted for 2 million years, and the dental patterns suggest that they didn't have the same habits. Modern day beavers probably even created habitat that was favourable to prehistoric giant beavers."
4,"Cool Days, Rainy Days, Any Days!!!","I just purchased this for the cool, wet spring months of New England. I also have the Bundle Me Original which was great for the winter months. This is a nice alternative when the Original becomes too warm to use , but you still need a little something. The inner lining is soft against your baby's skin and the outside lining protects him/her against cool weather and rain. The only negative thing I have to say about this is that it does not fit as well on my car seat as the Original. It tends to slide down a little. I have the new Graco Safe Seat which is larger than most car seats so this could be the reason. It may fit better on smaller car seats. I also love the pink ""girly"" color. Now that the weather is warming up a bit, it works great when going into air conditioned buildings that are just a little too cool for baby. It is also a nice barrier from the sun's harmful rays."
5,"My daughter looks so cozy in this, I want to climb in!","We received this as a shower gift, and it has become my 'give to every new mom' gift as it was one of our favorite items for our new daughter. It fit our car seat (Chicco) just fine without getting in the way of the straps. It is so fast to just put your baby in the seat, zip up, and go. Even though it is 'lite', it has a thin fleece lining that actually keeps baby quite warm. I do pull aside the cover when my daughter is in the car on warmer spring days to keep her from overheating. It is great for early morning daycare drop off when there is always a chill in the air! I plan on picking up the JJ Cole Big Bundle Me Original - Pink when my daughter gets older- they are great products!"
1,Not like the Original,"I used the original BundleMe all winter and loved the convenience and warmth it provided. When it started to get too warm for that, but too cool to go without a blanket, I decided to try the Bundle Me Lite. I assumed it would just be a thinner version of the original. It is not at all the same. I would consider it greatly inferior. We have the Chicco Keyfit and the original fit perfectly in the seat. Although the Lite seems to fit, the material (nylon or something as opposed to comfy cotton) is too slippery and it will not stay put, especially when you stick a squirmy baby on top of it. It is difficult to get it zipped once you finally get it correctly situated. The material reminds me of a raincoat or windbreaker - not a blanket. It seems uncomfortable for the baby and I stopped using it after less than a week."
4,Brain Candy,"Assassins is another one of those uncoventional musicals by Stephen Sondheim. Brilliant in its musical execution but lacking in the kind of heart one often seeks from musical theater. That said, it really does offer a lot of mind fodder as it explores the psyches of those who have attempted to assassinate America's chief executive officers throughout history. You'll be perversely pleased by Sondheim's zesty wit as displayed in the overly cheerful, sweet as candy songs. But soon his saccharin tone leaves you feelin' a bit bitter in the stomach as you try to digest the fact that we are talking something as serious as taking the life of another. Not sure this is palatable for all. But if you want something that makes you think, something that plumbs the playhouse's darker corners, you'll get some kick out of Assassins. Suggested for mature musical hounds."
4,"Good, but not the original...","I went to see Assassins on Broadway and was amazed at what I saw. I thought everyone did a phenominal job at their roles and it was the best show I had ever seen. I was so excited for the CD to come out, so I bought the original to hold me over. I loved it. I couldn't get over how much feeling the actors put into their roles, even on the CD. When the 2004 cast recording came out, i bought it right away. I am sad to say that it was no match to the original. I thought the sound quality was not terrific, and the actors, for the most part, seemed emotionless. Unfortunate because people who did not see the show must realize it was much better then this recording. The highlight of the recording is Neil Patrick Harris in his Balladeer role. I still sugest this CD to all, but, if you are looking for one CD, the original is the way to go."
4,Assassins' Strengths Preserverd,"Again a Stephen Sondheim show is recorded and thank goodness. On stage the show was felled by a weak book and weaker direction but the music still sored. It certainly is not the catchiest of Sondheim's scores, but it is a serious and important work. A great cast in great voice."
5,Sondheim is brilliant!,I love the sounds that Soundheim creates. He has done it once again. his music is so intelligently composed. The singers are fantastic. What I love about Sondheim is that he is the furthest thing from Andrew Lloyd Weber!Other CDs I recommend:Avenue QPassion (Sondheim)AssassinsSweeney Todd- my Favorite- Get the DVD and watch it!HairsprayLittle Shop of Horrors- the movie still rocksLa Traviata- the best operaThe Boy from OZandVoice Lessons To Go (both volumes)- So you can learn how to sing with all of the performers!
5,Even better than the Original,"Having heard the original broadway cast, I'd say I like this one even better. Michael Cerveris is absolutely great as John Wilkes Booth, and Neil Patrick Harris steals the whole friggin' show here. It's disappointing that the whole scene with Lee Harvey Oswald isn't on here, because I've heard it on other recordings, but it's still a really well put together recording."
4,Disturbing,"As a history major with a particular interest in WWII, I found this book both riveting and horrifying.History books tell you that Hitler systematically murdered 6 million Jews. But they don't give you the details. In ""The Secret Hunters"" Fiennes pulls no punches, and gives a gruesome account complete with details of how the Jews were abused by the SS in WWII.The only reason I gave this book only four stars instead of five is that the blurb gave me the impression that I was picking up an adventure tale of a treasure-hunting journey in Antarctica. While that is the direction the last quarter of the book took, it wasn't the main focus of the narrative. There was much more about the Holocaust and its atrocities itself.A thought provoking piece of work with an inconclusive ending that makes me wonder what happened to Derek Jacob."
2,"old model, get new one","This is an earlier model of the ford transmission filter. If you are replacing on a b series or ranger, get the newer filter, it's bigger and will still fit your transmission."
5,Bubbles galore - great to combine with bath bombs!,"You won't need to use the entire bar to get a huge amount of bubbles. Amandopondo might be the most bubble-producing bubble bar from Lush. The scent creates serenity and the lack of colour makes it perfect to mix with your favourite bath bomb. I find myself using this bubble bar, Blue Skies, and Ice Hotel more than any others."
4,Bubbles galore!,I've been a Lushie for a while but never tried this bar. Got the chance today and Yay! I only used about an eighth of the bar and the bubbles would not stop! The water became quite soft and while there was no color it was a great experience! I wish I could comment on the scent but as I am sick I couldn't smell it!Overall a wonderful bubble bar!
4,Sometimes you just want to smell like roses,"I don't mean your typical rose-scented drugstore soap. I mean the scent of a formal rose garden in June, with everything in full bloom and the heirloom roses perfuming the entire garden, and the honeybees going nuts, and closing your eyes and wanting to weep when you stick your nose into an old rose bred for fragrance, not form. That's the sort of rose scent you get from Amondopondo. I don't use it often, but every time I *do* use it, I wonder why I *don't* use it more often."
3,Meh...,"I got this for Christmas and while it is much better than most rose scented bubble baths and soaps that you would find, I found it a bit ""old lady"" I felt like I smelled like a grandma for the whole night after this. Plus, in comparison to most products lush offers, it's kind of boring. I would think that this would be a great first product for someone who would be put off by bright colored and heavily scented bathwater. One thing I have to say that was wonderful about this bubble bar is that my skin felt amazing afterwards. This really soothed it and that felt great!"
3,A bit more plot and a bit less action than the average Hong Kong martial arts film,Anti-drug martial arts movie with a bit more plot and a bit less action than average (but not a lot less action). Nice change from the usual Hong Kong Cinema fare.
3,It was decent,"For a Ti Lung Shaw brother movie that I have never seen before it was pretty good. The transfer does have a few grain issues but overall it looks really good.To me this was just not one of the better of the Shaw Brothers movies.It deals with the Opium issues that China went thru during the western invasion. However, I just did not feel for the characters. I also thought there was not enough KF action.Ti Lung always gives a good performance, however, this is not one of his better movies."
4,Victorian Romantic Suspense,"Amanda Quick has gone forward in time to the late Victorian era with her latest romance and she does a good job of it. Adam Hardesty and Caroline Fordyce each have secrets that could cause problems with their families if they were to be told. Adam is being threatened by a medium to keep his secret. When the woman is discovered murdered, Adam has only one lead and it leads him to Caroline Fordyce, author of serials in the tabloid newspapers. The two join forces to find the murderer and to protect each other, when another medium is murdered. The characters are multi-dimensional (though I miss the humorous aspects of earlier Quick books) and plot intricate. The identity of the villian is not apparent until the end. Overall, Quick has written an entertaining romance and an intriguing mystery."
4,I loved it,I love all of Amanda Quick's books so I'm not an unbiased reviewer. I really enjoyed the story line and can't wait for the next one.
2,this was really bad....,"I'm sorry to all the fans of this author, but I've read a lot of romance novels, and this is at the bottom of my list. This is a very boring book, and the writing is pretty bad. The romance is as passionate as watching the grass grow. Just to sum it up, the book is so dry and not interesting that I skipped most parts. They only reason I've read this book is because I moved to a new place and didn't have any TV or computer or radio with me, and this was the last resort. Dry Dry DRY! I give it 2 stars because I'm sure with a lot of concentration, the book is bearable, but I just really didn't like it."
2,Quick veers into the supernatural,"This one just missed the mark for me. Probably a little too much ""supernatural"" stuff. And while the main characters were mostly in the business of debunking those psychics, it still left a little too much wiggle room for me. I did like the characters, and it kept me reading - but I wouldn't say it was her best work. I was a little disappointed, considering some of the other books I've read by her. Overall it was a good book with a decent plot - and if you like psychic shenanigans in your romance novels, this would be the book for you."
5,Nice,This grill looks great and the price is great. It was a birthday present for my son and he loved it. It really changed the look of his truck!
3,The best band on the night......Carlisle City Hall 79?,"I saw this band as part of a 3 band package for 3.50 in Carlisle,England with White spirit sandwiched between Quartz and Gillan. I went out and bought the album the very next week and still have it..20 years later. White Spirit had plenty critics knocking them as a sort of 'poor man's Deep Purple',but for me ,they were the best band on the night..tight and polished. I will buy this ...."
5,party of five season three,Loved it couldnt stop watching neither could my daughter can't wait til the next season comes out im addicted
4,FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT,THE SHOW'S GO THROUGH REAL LIFE UP'S & DOWN'S. HOW THE KID'S TRY HARD TO KEEP PEACE WITH EACH OTHER.
5,FINALLY!! KEEP THEM COMING,"This is sooo awesome, party of five was my favorite show in high school, I am soo excited to watch and buy the complete third season, I hope the complete series will follow! thanks for making the fans happy!"
3,The Curse of Naar is one of the best Grand Master Adventures,"American economics and trade screw everything up. Abridged books (espically the Lone Wolf kind) should be sins punashable by eternal damnation. These Grand Master books just aren't the same as the previous unaltered adventures. However, The Curse of Naar is the most thrilling of the series. I only wish I could get my hands on the UNABRIGED version..."
5,Rage & Glee,"Volumes of letters should be judged by their editing as much as their content, hence the five stars. Z. Leader is thorough, intelligent, impartial, and exact. There is sufficient scholarly apparatus to guide the working academic and the demanding lay reader. As for the letters, well, there are a lot of them. Despite his professed laziness, Amis cranked off an immense amount of smart, thoughtful, scurrilous, and funny correspondence in the 50+ years recorded here. Exemplary funny bits are on pages 276-277 in a 1952 letter to Philip Larkin. If you laugh, buy the book. If you don't, don't. If you're shocked by cruel, rude jokes between close friends, don't. Amis demanded, and often provided, hard thinking, precise expression, and blunt honesty. His staunchly conservative, sometimes reactionary, views contrast interestingly with his drunken philandering, which should provoke thought among those readers who enjoy thinking at all."
4,Wife loves this Anklet!,"This was my wife's email when she received her gift from me: ""I love the anklet!!! I put it on right away. At first I thought it was a bracelet but then I glanced at the packaging slip. The anklet is very cute."""
5,anatomy teacher,"This is a great movie.. I showed it in my anatomy class for years, so when I moved I purchased it to show my Human Body class at the local community college. He came as quickly as promised."
2,Educational Censorship,I have watched this series but not purchased it. I just had to say that the educational censorship in the sensation episode is disappointing. How can you have an entire hour long episode about sensations and nerve endings in the human body and not talk about pleasure at all?
2,Informative lackluster entertainment,"Human Body: Pushing the Limits reaches unprecedented heights of poor formatting. The material presented in this collection of Discovery Channel's latest consumer exploits had a massive degree of potential, nevertheless speedy production did a foul number on this beast.Main problems:Repetitive graphics from one human feat to the next detract from the originality of the story presentedNarrative format is poorly paced (e.g. the film watches like a long commercial)Lacking in quantity of personal accountsQuality suffers from numerous cuts for commercial breaks (no actual commercials are in the film)On the plus side, the personal stories are mostly fascinating. Despite the boring CGI models that invade the screen perpetually, the information presented is highly informative.If I were you, I would just watch it on cable if it ever gets aired again."
5,Indispensable para todos los papas,"Mi hija de 7 meses se despertaba 2 a 3 veces por noche, y gracias a este libro, en solo 2 noches durmio de un tiron! Fabuloso, muy facil y entretenido. 100% recomendable para todos los papas."
1,Burns like crazy--wonder if reviews are legit,"After reading all the positive reviews, I was hopeful this would help. Not true! I put it on before bed and it burned like crazy. It was so strong I felt my heart racing and couldn't sleep. After about an hour it still hadn't stopped stinging so I had to rinse it off. I had to useBoiron Avenoc Suppositories, 12 suppositories (Pack of 2)to soothe the area. I tried it once more the next day with the same result. Not only was it unpleasant to use, but the smell was sickening. I had to take my garbage out to the bin as it lingered all over the room. I couldn't imagine using this stuff before work! I have my doubts about some of these 5-star reviews being legitimate. Several are similar in tone and language, using plays on words and instructing people what products to use in great detail. I have been shopping on Amazon for years and they don't look real to me. Buyer beware!"
5,Great!!,This tube of ointment may be small but it is powerful. It comes with a new tip for every use and provides immediate long lasting relief!
3,"soothes, but no miracles or cure here","If you're looking for a cure, then look elsewhere. Admittedly I don't think any ointment is going to cure ""hemmoroids""... I think the only thing that has helped me to any extent has been a change of diet (stay away from refined carbs and sugars and fried greasy foods and eat more vegetables).Yes, this does soothe things - but you can also use witchhazel alcohol which is much cheaper (may sting a little though)...A good product, but not really a long term solution thing."
2,use it if you want to smell bad,"I didn't like this product at all. I read reviews complaining about the bad smell, but I had so much pain that I said how bad could it be? Boy I was wrong, It smells like hell.i couldn't be around people, and worse of all the relief lasted for a few minutes for me it wasn't worth it. I ended up using preparation H suppositories and the wipes. that gave me relief fast. But the best for me are the fargelin tabletsHigh Strength Fargelin 36 Tablets,Preparation H Medicated Hemorrhoidal Wipes with Witch Hazel and Aloe, 48-Count Refill Packages (Pack of 4),Preparation H Hemorrhoidal Suppositories (48 count)"
1,"Chinese product, I.e. medicine from China",China products should have a warning label on them. They are not controlled. Remember the pet food deaths. Remember the baby formula deaths. Remember the drywall in the south.It shows Chinese writing in the pic of the package.
2,Jury still out.,I found this product and read all the miraculous reviews and decided to try it. When you order you get three small tubes of product. I have finished one tube and have not seen the results some others have (according to their review).The smell of it isn't bad as some have noted. I'm going to continue and will update. It is better than Preparation H. I don't know how the stay in business.UPDATE: I have used all three tubes and I still have the same problem. I will not be buying any more of this product.
1,Burns,"OK - only read the positive reviews. Just tried it. The smell is bad but that's not the problem. It burns like crazy - had to rinse it off. Will be throwing the rest out. Try at your own risk, should have read the negative reviews first."
1,does NOT do anything,"This product is absolutely an scam, it does not do anything. i tried other products and they did helped. but not this. trusting those fake reviews and buying this product is just waste of money and time."
3,"only temporary relief, try hemclear","I tried everything. This stuff and others on amazon is good for temporary relief. Mine usually comes back from drinking the day before. The only thing that work regardless of drinking or not is hemclear. Although it's stop for 2 weeks as of today, I'll update if it comes back but the longest so far. I'm very hopeful and very excited that I had to do a review for anyone who doesn't know about this product."
4,"Great Product, Tiny Tubes, Not Much For The Money....","This creme works really well. I gave it 4 stars because I am disappointed that the tubes are sovery small. They are smaller than travel size tubes of toothpaste.I bought a package of 3 thinking I was getting some for later use,however, the three tubes really equal maybe one half tube of regular store bought H creme.Not sure if I will buy again or not. Homeopathic pills are available that do the same thingand are pretty reasonably priced. This does lubricate and sooth the area great though. ;DNOTE: I am working on eating real foods from the earth, and NOT grocery store ""Food Like Productsthat cause disease in the first place, so that my body is healthier and has enough fiber and waterwith real nutrients to keep the hemorrhoids from happeningin the first place. ;D"
2,Cooling but stinky,"I am very surprised at the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I have not been overly impressed. Yes the product is cooling but that is where it stops. The smell is very strong and musky, so strong in fact that I'm self conscious to use it if I am going out in public. Also, the packaging is entirely in Chinese ( god only know what we are really rubbing on our butts!), and if you read through the reviews, there is no consensus on what color and consistency it is supposed to have - again, not a confidence builder. It all makes me dubious about these miracle reviews."
5,Really Works,"Cooling, soothing, this product really works. I was a bit skeptical, but tried it based on the reviews; I am most pleased, obtained relief after one day!No burning, no itching, I am most pleased."
1,Not for Everyone,"This product actually aggravated the condition making it a lot worse. If you read the warnings on the label ,it actually warns about discontinuing use when this happens so obviously it is not the solution for everyone."
1,Did not work for me.,Used it for a week. Caused a great deal of pain which continued even after I stopped using the product.
5,Really Works!,"I was very skeptical, however all the great reviews along with my suffering got me to order this. It worked immediately! I still can't believe how well and what relief I have. Highly recommend. And as for the smell, it really isn't bad it just seems like a strong plant type scent. you can use a q-tip like one other customer suggested or not. Very pleased and I can take this with me. Also ordered the anuice, not sure how I feel about it yet and find that I use this over that. If you are looking for relief try this!"
5,Excellent product,"Instant relief, very effective. Much better than anything you can find at local drug store. From what I can tell, better ingredients too. Five stars."
5,Wow! Problems solved,"I was ready to go to the doc and do the laser thing. I was miserable. I thought I'd give the natural remedies a try before going that route. So last week, I purchased Fargelin tablets on Amazon and am taking 3 pills, 3 times-a-day. I also bought Avatrol capsules here on Amazon and am taking one of those caps once-a-day. I also purchased some Mayinglong Musk hemroid ointment here on Amazon. (Good stuff!) It's been just one-week since I embarked on this plan of attack and the 'roids' have shrunk and all my pain is GONE! I don't know which one worked the wonder, or if it has been a combo of all, but whatever it is, I am so thankful for the relief. I also purchased Yerba Prima psyllium husks at Amazon (not Metamucil) and am now regular as a Swiss train. Total cost was about $120 but has saved me from a $2,500 operation. A GREAT return on investment! I hope and pray you have similar results. All the best!"
2,I CAN teach myself without disappointment,"I bought this book thinking highly of it, i was pretty dissappointed with the way the book carried itself.mr.bailey didn't really give me any information i could really use. and he has a ""10 commandments of erotica"" in this book that covers some of the ideas i use in my stories. he is informative but this is the kind of book a novel writer should buy and not an amateur like myself,i give him some credit, but i would not recommend this book to anybody."
5,Best practical advice I've encountered on the subject,"Mike Bailey has long experience of publishing (and writing) erotic books in the UK - he founded the Nexus imprint for Virgin and managed all the Headline erotic imprints until they retreated from the genre in the late 90s. As a consequence it's worth taking his pithy but to-the-point remarks on board - particularly if you're new to the business. I've published four erotic novels and still found his remarks relevant, both in and out of erotica. It's obvious from some of the comments below that the 'Britishness' of the text is a little bewildering for US readers accustomed to how-to authors dotting every I and dotting every T. Persevere, guys! Sometimes less is more. It's also possible to be witty and make a serious point at the same time."
4,"Best Disney Movie since ""The Lion King""","Hercules restored my faith that Disney can still make fun, engaging animated movies (this one's much better than the more recent disappointing Road to El Dorado or The Emperor's New Groove). The animation is dazzling (from the makers of Aladdin and The Little Mermaid), the music is a new take -- gospel, and the characters are funny. The voices include a cast of famous names, such as Tate Donovan and Danny DeVito as Hercules and his goat-man sidekick. The plot is predictable and the storytelling of the Greek myth may be a bit off, but after all, it's Disney. The DVD includes a documentary (""The Making of Hercules"") and a Ricky Martin music video (for the song ""I Can Go the Distance""), and most Disney DVDs hardly have any extras. I wouldn't call this movie a must-buy, but it's a welcome addition to Disney's family of great cartoon movies... and kids will certainly love it, too."
2,"Bronze, not Gold Edition. should have been much better,","This is a horrible transfer. Video quality is poor at best. Should have kept watching the vhs version. This is not widescreen. Fullscreen is 1:33, this is 1:66. The picture is taller and not wider. I was very dissapointed when I saw this is family friendly widescreen. If the black bars are on the sides it is not widescreen. Glad I only paid 10.00, but I still feel ripped off though. Otherwise I love the movie, just wish Disney did not lazily transfer this. Will look for laserdisc instead till bluray comes out."
5,Hurcules,Very good DVD was happy to find it because they are no longer selling it because Disney put it in the vault. Excellent movie.
3,WHAT A WATSE OF TIME AND MONEY,"Disney can most certainly do beter than this. True, I DID like it to some extent...and giving creift where its due, it WAS good, but Disney could have done better than this!"
3,"Good, not great","This was good, not very good, not great, but good. After reading the Amazon review, I was hoping for some great songs, but only one song really did it for me. I was not a fan of the way the characters looked, a style that looked a bit annoying to me, with a modern art type look.I have to say I did get bored with parts of this movie. Only one animated scene blew me away-- the river of dead souls that Herc had to jump into to try to save his love. Very cool scene, but unfortunately one of the scary scenes that will keep me from showing this movie to my kids until they are older (as with almost all movies, I'd recommend pre-viewing this film because you are the best judge of what your kids can handle with action and scary characters).I am borderline if I regret purchasing this or not... if only it wasn't so pricey..."
2,Disney Ruined Greek mythology,"I like most Disney movies but I hated this one. I love Greek mythology and they ruined it. I can sort of understand some of the changes because this is a movie for kids. However, some of the changes were just stupid. That part were Phil is talking about the other greek heros is horrible. None of them failed and Perseus is a constellation. I did like some of the songs. Disney should have done another myth that would be better suited to be made into a movie for kids."
2,NOT one of Disney's Best,"The kids like it, so I guess that's all that matters. But overall, It's not what I would consider a Disney Classic. In fact, It's not very memorable. Get ""Monsters,Inc"" or ""Tarzan"" instead. Chances are your kids won't watch it a second or third time."
2,How inaccurate can ya get?,"Alright, I know, I know, this is a children's movie but still. First of all, Hera and Zeus were NOT happily married; she only married him because he raped her. Secondly, Hera was not Hercules' mom nor did she love him, she tried to kill him on numerous occasions. Hercules was one of the offspring of one of Zeus' many ""consorts"". Another thing, this is supposed to be Greek mythology, in Greek mythology Hercules was called Heracles and only become Hercules in Roman mythology. Also, there were nine muses not five. Narcissus would be dead and not up on Mount Olympus staring into a mirror; as soon as he discovered himself with his reflection in a lake, he stayed there and slowly died. Gah! I like this movie but it annoys me too much with all the mess ups in it."
2,Movie is good but the disc was in very poor condition,"Love this movie and wanted to watch it the second I got it in the mail, but put it in to play and froze after the first 20 minutes of watching."
5,Great Movie,"I was a bit surprised when my older daughter wanted this - but was very glad as it's one of my favorites from Disney - very funny, age appropriate for ANY age and just a great addition to our movie collection."
4,Ggod Disney film,"It took me a while to see this film. Reason: James Woods in a Disney movie. I did love the music & Danny De Vito's character. Overall, a good Disney film & a good DVD. Good picture quality."
3,A decent movie.,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, though I never saw it in the theatres. The music is Ok, not as good as most Disney films, but not that bad. The animation is good, and the story is OK. I have noticed that several critics here and other places have panned this movie because it strays from greek mythology. While that is true, it is exactly the way Disney has treated every story they have laid there hands on since the 70's, so it should come as no surpise. If you expected to see an accurate portayal of greek mythology in a Children's movie given to us by Disney, I have to ask what you were thinking.It's no Beauty and the Beast, but it sure is better than _Pocahontas_"
5,Movies,"I really love Disney movies, especially the older ones that I grew up with, and although this one is a little bit newer, It is a really great one!"
3,i got it new?,i got it new and it was new it was still in it wrapping but it looks like its old. not sure why but i guess it works out still a great movie
4,Hercules Review,The only problem with the movie is the sound is messed for the first 5 minutes. It's really quite then all of a sudden it's really loud.
4,"Okay, I'm gonna try to make this short...","Hercules is a pretty good movie, even though it's not ""right up there"" with my favorites (It did, however, instill an interest in Greek mythology). As other reviewers have said, the animation is a bit cartoonier than usual, and it IS inaccurate. The music is a little above average (but how do we define average?) save for one stand-out: the Meg song. This film isn't a bad comedy, and the in-jokes know no bounds (read some Greek mythology, it will get funnier!)My favorite character would have to be Meg. The love story in this is very good, but, unlike in Pocahontas, gets the point across without taking over the whole essence of the film. All in all, this is a good movie. See it and write your own reviews!"
3,What? Disney spoofs itself??,"Hercules is just one of the many fun Disney movies like any other. Therefore you can expect a fun movie to watch. Just read any other review or think of any other Disney movie you have seen.Hercules has some funny elements. First of all the voices of James Woods and Danny DeVito are funny and add something to the characters they 'play'.There are some inside joke only adults will understand. The funniest bit is when Hercules gets famous and the people in Greece start making merchandise for him. Vases, little statues and drinking cup (think McD) all with his image. This of course happens every time Disney brings out a movey. Even a Herculas credit card is in the movie! It's the highlight in an otherwise standard Disney movie."
3,This movie has some mildly sexist content.,"The VHS video isn't currently available, but I nevertheless saw it in the theaters a few years before. Though the animation is really colorful and eye-popping as usual, there are some things in it that I don't immediately approve of, nor will the families of younger kids. Megan is supposed to be a sex symbol for this film, yes - but she acts a little like a prostitute around Hercules as well as that pink winged horse trying to seduce Pegasus. This has a little sexual undertone and it is kind of sleazy. In addition, there's that really creepy part about Megan dying and her spirit being swept away into the underworld. Most adults who are in gothic fantasy would appreciate this scene, but parents who haven't yet exposed young kids to the very concept of death may be spooked away. But overall, it is a very visually enthralling tour of an animated Ancient Greece ever since the centaurs-and-centaurettes part in the 1940's ""Fantasia""."
3,A classic,This is a classic Disney movie. Not very exciting but a great classic for small chilldren.
5,Extremely Pleased and Impressed,I ordered the product on a Friday and by Tuesday I had received it in the mail. I was truly impressed with the speed with which the transaction occurred. It was a very good experience and I would do it again.
4,An instant Disney classic,"When this first came out, I thought it looked pretty stupid. When I finally did see it, I was pleasantly surprised. It has a fun different feel than any other Disney movie. I dont really like a lot of the modern Disney movies with their different spin on classic fairy tales, but this didnt feel like that. Its very cute and still retains its message. To me, its actually more mature than alot of older Disney films. So, while this is not my fave Disney movie by far, its still a wonderful addition."
5,Disney Goofed!,"I can't tell the number of hours my daughter and I sat in our big chair with a big bowl of pop-corn watching and rewatching this movie. She always loved it at five and, now at twelve, she still does.Some people pick this movie apart as if it is supposed to be somehow ""accurate"" to the mythology. Sheesh! It's a disney film. Just enjoy the beautiful colors, more than tolerable story line, exceptional music and campy laughs. I did rewatching it for the first time on dvd.One final point: Disney goofed in that they being one of the most left-wing liberal organizations out there mistakenly presented the Gospel to the world in cartoon allegory.Think about it: The only Son of the Most High becomes human, and dwells among men, ""discovers"" himself, all the while perfoming a myriad miraculous feats. How does he become a ""True Hero""? By sacrificing himself for the one that he loves...His bride.Alright, it's a bit of a stretch and surely unintentional, but it still works. It's a beautiful thing!"
2,The Spanish language version has a special guest voice!,"Although this one is clearly not one of the all-time best Disney films, and the content is mor haphazardly put together than the hair on Hades' head, there are some razzle dazzle moments and sentimental scenes to warrant a few viewings. But more interestingly, this DVD does include exclusive alternate language versions of the film (in Spanish and French). No one seems to have noticed that in the Spanish version of Hercules, the speaking voice of the adult Herc is provided by none other than singer Ricky Martin! In essence, we are paying essentially for 3 different versions of the movie, and while Martin is still hot, an exclusive collector's item! I am also glad that the alternate versions took enough care in duplicating the voices as closely as possible. It's hard to recommend this film on its own merits, as there are few. But these little extras make the Special Edition DVD worthwhile."
3,"It's ok ,but not as good as Hunchback of Notre Dame","This movie is ok but it just sworda drags you away up until the song I won't say I'm in love ,your complety Asleep ! My sister Krystle would sit through The Hunchback of Notre dame (the Disney animated one ) but this on the other hand she would get up after the first four scene's . This movie gave me Nightmares for 2 day's about ! I'm sorry but Hunchback of Notre Dame is way better ,That sum's it up ."
2,"Great movie, terrible video quality.","This review specifically refers to the Gold Collection DVD. The transfer to DVD is one of the worst I've ever seen - I upgraded from a VHS tape and the video quality of both are about on par. It's watchable and the younger kids may not care, but very disappointing considering what it could have been. If you have a larger TV expect to be underwhelmed."
5,Good for all ages,"I really love this movie. I bought the DVD to replace my VHS - I don't know why Disney only decides to revamp and rerelease some movies and not others.This movie's heroine has a dry, sarcastic wit which I find very refreshing. Phil's character provides more slapstick humor that makes the kids giggle every time. It's a well rounded movie with fighting, humor, and glurge. The music is my favorite part."
1,The film deserves NO credit. Disney thinks that people are too stupid to read the great stories that they changed.,"I am so mad at Disney and their movie ""Hercules"" because they changed the film just because they think they will get away with changing stories. I like Greek Mythology, but the movies have not been good at all. And this weak effort is not going to do anything about it. The plot has been changed completly, Pegasus is never mentioned in the real version, He is not trying to impress people, he had no trainer, the lion and the lion skin is not mentioned, the hydra fight is because of a different reason, ugly characters, Hercules was never in love with a chick, Hades is not a bad guy but he is not good either, and all kinds of things that I won't mention.Don't buy this movie because it is completly different, why don't you read Greek mythology instead of watching this?"
1,Buy the DVD instead,"Take your pick between bad and worse.... the streaming video skips frames and is heavily compressed. Downloading the video via Amazon's ""unbox"" app still results in noticeable compression. The video is full of artifacts and jaggy lines.This is a poor way to watch a childhood classic. I love this movie and I look forward to the day it comes out on bluray!"
5,Good price!,"Good price! I bought this DVD for my son's preschool, it's rated G. It was a good price and the kids enjoyed it."
2,Hercules,The quality is very poor. It's obviously a very old tape & it makes a humming sound through the whole movie
2,Lacking courage of his convictions...,"Amitav Kumar's ""Husband Of A Fanatic"" is well written but I came away feeling pity for the author's lack of spine. Marrying a Pakistani Muslim, he feels he hasn't converted to Islam but has no guts to stand up to his convictions when being forced to change his name to a Muslim one. Despite acknowledging the Official ban on Hindu-Muslim marriage in Pakistan and unbroken legacy of forced conversions, he has the gall to spend 99% of the book criticizing India's openness and secularism (however flawed) & Hinduism in general hiding behind the excesses of RSS, Shiv Sena and BJP. What is sickening is that he feels very little compunction to apply the same standards to a much more closed and brutal society and religion in Pakistan.So here is one more spineless Hindu intellectual essentially apologising to his ""superior"" Muslim Masters and in the mean time collecting a few more browny points with the appeasing Liberal Intellectuals in the West. Very depressing indeed."
3,Dead Irish,"A little slow out of the gate and at times throughout the story. Overall, a decent skyscraper read, not his best."
4,Murphy says,enjoyed Dismas' excapades. John Lescroart never disappoints!!!! . looking forward to reading more from this author about the main character Dismas Hardy.
2,First and last for me,"This was the first and last Dismas Hardy series mystery that I will be reading. Sloppy writing, and a muddled and not very well-developed plot, make this a loser. If it wasn't such a fast read, I would have given up half-way through. As it is, I wish that I had. Don't waste your time in the same way."
2,Dissappointing,"I tried this because Lescroart was recommended by a friend and this is his first ""Dismas Hardy"". Was disappointed in that the characters are not deeply drawn and the plot line seems improbable."
3,FIRST DISMAS HARDY BOOK,"This was my first book by John Lescroart, I like to read things in order. Dismas Hardy is his hero, former, ex-everything and a very disgruntled guy. I will read the next one to try and find out what all the hype is, but this one was slow and not very exciting. I found his attempt to get back with his ex-wife , or her attempt to be a really good part and thats bad when it doesn't deal with the mystery. Too many characters way too fast. More details please."
2,"Starts off well, then fades","This mystery novel has a good opening and is compelling in its presentation of the characters. The atmosphere remains until about the middle. Then it gets stuck in a number of scenes that are too slow, and a description of a villain who is supposed to be provocative, but turns out to be a bitter and disappointing stereotype. I realize that because this is a book about a murder, whoever the author picked to be the culprit wouldn't be nice at all. Still, some of the passages which explain the criminal's character could have been pulled from any cliched argument on temptation and related topics. Another series of scandals, another person who thinks he or she is justified because they were frustrated, and so on. Meanwhile, the countless men and women who don't scoff at their commitments and don't wind up murdering anybody, don't seem to have novels written about them. Pity, that."
4,Dead Irish (Dimas Hardy),"In the latest Dimas Hardy mystery, Dis finds himself helping out another friend find the bad guy. There are alot of twists and turns in this one, so everytime I thought I knew who did it, I got fooled again. It did keep me listening longer than I wanted to. It was fast paced and interesting, highly recommend if your a Dismas Hardy fan."
3,"book is good, but publisher is gouging for Kindle edition","I enjoy every Dismas Hardy book. Some are a little slow, but I enjoy the characters and am quite willing to accept the changes in Mr. Hardy's life. I originally entered the series around 1998, so I missed a lot of the early stuff. I wanted to go through the whole series on Kindle, but it took forever for book 2 The Vig to become available. And now that it has, the price is a shock. This is an *old* book and pricing it over 10 bucks is nuts. I checked Dead Irish, the first in the series and one I bought last March and I paid $6.39 back then. The price has almost been doubled also, to over 10 bucks. The publisher is simply gouging, and I'm not impressed. I can wait a long time to get these prices back to something reasonable. So on to other authors for now ..."
3,"Great characters, needed a better story.","It's always good to read the first book of a series as it lays the groundwork for the characters and their relationships. This book did a very good job of creating the defining the principal characters by making them interesting enough that I want to read more about them. The setting was well done. However, the story had too many red herrings and I found myself disappointed by the ending."
3,see john grow,"Several reviewers have compared this novel unfavourably to later examples of the Dismas Hardy/Abe Glitsky series. But the book is the first of the series, and although it's weaker than later examples, it's a good read, with very sympa characters. And as always, the essence of San Francisco is bottled in some very evocative descriptions. So, fair plot, good characters, excellent setting. Well worth a look, and the later books in the series just get better. Press on....."
2,Don't go out of your way for this one.,"This is my second Lescroart novel and so far it's nothing compared to Guilt. I enjoyed some of the characters but the plot was really thin and not really that much of a mystery at all. Just a by the numbers detective story. If you have nothing else to read, you could do worse, but it's really nothing spectacular."
3,"Not his best, not his worst","Dead Irish is an entertaining novel and Dismas Hardy is an extremely likeable character. For those who have read ""A Certain Justice,"" you'll like this much better. For those who have read ""The 13th Juror,"" this won't match up but it's worth your time."
2,Slow mystery with too much filler.,Dead Irish is a slow mystery that eventually catches your attention but not until the final 3/4s of the book. Too many characters and subplots that don't have much bearing on the actual mystery was rather confusing to me at times.
2,Not blown away by this,"I listened to the audio version, and was pretty disappointed. I'm hoping some of the problem is the abridgement. While the book is ostensibly about Hardy, he didn't really seem to play a major role. It was just a grim tale about a LOT of people messing up their lives, and killing a lot of other people in the process.In the middle, Hardy gets some romantic action, after reminiscing about the death of his baby, for which he feels responsible. From his description of events, he IS responsible, so that did nothing to endear the character to me.I saw every plot twist a mile before it happened, and I consider myself a pretty naive reader, so that's not good.I gather this book is one of a series, and wonder if maybe the author is counting on us to already like his principal character. I'll try another Lescroart book, but if it's like this one, it will be my last."
4,A positive approach to an undecided career choice,I have been wanting to get the low-down on a Social Work career. Everything I needed and wanted to know is all in one book. The do's and dont's of a prospective Social Worker was most informative.
3,Nice hydration pack when you need to carry a little more than the bare essentials.,"The pack is very comfortable, and has ample room for some extra gear. The 100 ounce reservoir is a good size too for my long recreational rides.My only gripe about the pack, is the lack of something stiff/hard in between the reservoir and the 'Air Director' back panel. When you fill the reservoir to full capacity, it is elliptical in shape and tends to push the center of the back panel out towards your back. And this cuts down on the efficiency/effectiveness of the 'Air Director' back panel. I took an old 3 ring binder that I had laying around, and cut the front cover off and shoved it in there, and that helped a lot."
1,Poor Quality,"I recently ordered 2 Queen Anne style Cherry dining room chairs from Amazon - suborder throught Visiondecor - the chairs were not the same ones in the picture on the amazon site. Also, when the chairs arrived they were missing one of the dowels and they were dirty and dinged up - I gave them a poor rating and refused to recant the poor rating even though they offered money to do so. I needed the chairs for a family funeral otherwise, I would have returned them - they were of poor quality - the legs had a gap of at least 1/2 inch between the leg and the seat and they were not of good quality. I called Poundex directly to complain about the quality and I was told that I had to take the issue up with the distributor - I asked to speak to Quality Control and my request was refused. I would still like to return them and get my money back"
3,Well made chairs,"Well made chairs, although the plastic cover on the seats is flimsy. The finish is very good and the appearance is OK"
1,Queen Anne Chairs by Poundex,"We purchased 2 sets of these chairs (4 total). Upon receipt, the back of one was broken. We received a replacement. One year later, the front leg on one of the chairs split. This chair had been used fewer than 12 times. We are unable to get a replacement leg since the seller seems to constantly change and what I perceive to be the manufacturer (Poundex) says they have been discontinued. It is interesting that the chairs have been discontinued yet they are still offered on Amazon."
2,Dull as dishwater,"Dull as dishwater. It appears that Howells had nothing to write about and did so for roughly 400 pages. The conversations, especially those with the Reverend Walker and more especially those about Savanarola, are dreary, virtually pointless and meander on for an eternity--filigree and no more. The descriptions of Italy would have been best left to travel books and those of the carnivals are ordinary at best. The conflicts confronting Colville, while typical of the literature of this period, seem as forced and artificial as his surrounding characters. Altogether, the novel has no spark and had I not decided to read all of Howells' novels, I would have put it down long ago.""The Ambassador"" leaves this work decidedly in the dust."
5,Stop-Motion in Motion!,"This disc proves that the Resfest DVDs are NOT strictly a showcase for digital films. Two outstanding stop-motion shorts are included on this volume: ""More"" and ""Dog"". Mark Osborne's ""More"" is, without question, one of the truly great animated films -- a parable about passion and routine, simple pleasures and self-satisfaction. It's been included on other anthologies, but if you've missed it - SEE IT HERE! Suzie Templeton's (nice to see the work of women directors get some visibility, I might add) ""Dog"" is dark, deep and harrowing. A quiet tension builds between son and father, infecting the scene and giving it an urgency not often seen in a short film.That's all I can say. The rest of the films are good, as always, but if the disc were to only include the two stop-motion marvels, it would still be well worth the price. Enjoy!"
4,Good assortment of short films,"The DVD producers have helpfully included commentaries and details about the film and filmmaker, including technical details on the equipment used to make the film.Here are the films, with Director, running time, and production date:1) BAD ANIMALS (Birdsell - 4:40 - 2000)2) BIKE RIDE (Schroeder - 6:35 - 2000)3) COPY SHOP (Widrich - 12:00 - 2001) Oscar (R) nominee4) COUNTERFEIT FILM (Simon 0 2:00 - 2001)5) DELUSIONS IN MODERN PRIMITIVISM (Loflin - 17:00 - 2000)6) DOG (Templeton - 5:00 - 2001)7) HEADCLEANER (Bavari - 1:23 - 1999)8) HELICOPTER (Gold - 21:00 - 2000)9) MORE (Osborne - 6:00 - 1998) Oscar (R) nominee 1999 (Wikipedia has an entry on MORE)10) SWEET (Couvillion - 4:37 - 2000)11) TELLING LIES (Ellis - 4:20 - 2000)12) ZEN AND THE ART OF LANDSCAPING (Kartch - 17:00 - 2000)"
1,Never sent me the disc,"I ordered this thing several times and each time, after a week or so, I got an email saying that it was out of stock. That scenario continued for years. I finally found the filmmaker who made ""More"" from this collection, and bought THAT short directly from him. It was great. Too bad that Amazon was never able to get it together with this item."
2,Intermittently works great,"I purchased this device after having to separate our file/print server from the printers by more than the 5 meter USB limit. I first tried a USB-to-cat5 adapter that was way too slow for printing, and instead of getting a dedicated print PC went for the Keyspan PS-4A because it supports all 4 of my printers.I've been using it for a long time now, and for two of the four PCs on our network it works well. The auto-connect feature is good, although I'm finding that users often just manually attach to a printer and forget to let go later. The auto-connect seems to only work intermittently too, and not at all for one of the computers. I've had to periodically unplug/plug the device to reset it. The bottom-line is that after a year I've given up and am looking for another solution. There's just been too many headaches for a device that I should have been able to set-and-forget."
1,Useless,The setup was not too difficult and once completed the print server refused to work continuously over any period of time.
3,Better for others?,"I attempted to use this print server with Windows Vista and a Sony notebook. Unfortunately the software caused multiple crashes on my system, and had to be removed and the product returned. So why even 3 stars, you ask? Because if it wouldn't have caused the crashes, it would have been the easiest print server to install and use that I've ever had."
2,Decent Product; Horrible Customer Service,"After 6 months of use, the print server stopped working. Anything hooked up to it (computers, printers, scanners) was not recognized. Repeated inquiries to Keyspan for assistance in troubleshooting were ignored. Very frustrating."
4,everything works fine,as soon as i installed the software it recognized the server .. only one problem with a printer that had a parallel to usb cable converter (think the problem is with the cable because it worked fine the first time and after restart don't know what happened).. the usb printers work fine.
5,Keyspan PS-4A 4 Port Print Server,Good product that allows for up to four printers to be used. Low cost.
1,didnt work,I was able to only get one USB printer to work. The other 3 showed up as being connected but when I tried to print it said they weren't there. I spent almost 6 hours trying before giving up and returning the unit for a refund.
1,Flakey and incompatible with XP64,"Despite what they say, the PS-4A is incompatible with XP64(no drivers) and multifunction machines(doesn't recognize them). It is a nightmare to set up. It took almost all day just to get it running on one of my laptops (that was using XP). Even after getting it set up, it was flakey and kept losing the settings I put in to get it to work. The set up software and instructions were useless and I had to do everything manually. This thing has a lot of promise but it's not ready for prime time. Unless you enjoy being a beta tester I suggest you avoid this little marvel."
5,A Dexter Tour De Force,"Dexter Gordon was in top form for this collection of standards recorded in 1975. His playing from his late European era is equal to anything he did in his Savoy/Dial period of the 1940s or his Blue Note period in the 1960s. Some of Dexter's output from his European period was hit and miss, but on his Steeplechase recordings from the mid 1970s he was batting 1000.This album is mostly hard-charging standards played in the bebop tradition. 30 years after the inception of bebop, he made it sound as fresh as ever. The standout tracks are Miles Davis' So What, which Dexter made his own with a hard driving, galloping rendition, and In a Sentimental Mood, played as a soprano/bass duet. Dexter's full-bodied tone on a soprano ballad is distinctive, rare, and absolutely gorgeous.This album reunited Dexter with pianist Horace Parlan, who played on Dexter's Blue Note classic Doin' Alright."
3,Dexter sounds great but...,"I listened to the cd a few times, wondering what's wrong. I mean - Dexter's sound is as gorgeous as ever, and he is certainly in great playing shape. But he sounds uninspired, even bored at times (Red Cross, for example). Listening to the rhythm section solved the mystery. While the bass and piano sound good, the drummer just isn't up to providing the right support for this kind of music. While he plays ok on ""So what"", he sounds confused and unstable on most other tracks, at times even unmusical. With a drummer like that - Gordon does the best he can, but even he can't fix the problem. If you want to listen to a Quartet cd by Gordon, check out the classic ""Go !"" where everyone plays great.I recommend the cd only to collectors who already have the rest of Gordon's wonderful discography."
2,Are we Reviewing the same Movie?,"This movie was somewhat watchable when it was free on TV. I am shocked by all the positive reviews. Esp. when so many critics rip apart good movies. This movie came out in '99, so the whole gay thing was already kinda tired then.Jeremy Northram does not work in any way as a redneck convict. He even periodically loses his accent. Much of Zahn's antics seemed a litttle more groan worthy than funny. Macy is kind of sweet as the town's closeted sheriff. But overall this movie just didn't work or seem believable. None of these actors seem like Texans. The plot was kinda stock. Simply not a 5 star movie."
3,Dumb and Dumber III...,"The guys in this film are dumber than dirt but they get the women anyway so the women must be really dumb or hard up. If you liked the elegant Jeremy Northam of 'The Idal Husband', 'Emma' or the 'Winslow Boy' buy those DVD's first. William Macy's character (the lawman) is sappy and I found him very unappealing (buy Fargo instead).The film has the depth, class, and humor of 'The Three Stooges.' Older kids might like the film because they can laugh at a guy holding a squashed Armidillo, but you might not want your kids to see it."
1,Bad Movie! Volenteer to live in Cuba before watching this!,"I dont how I ever came by to watch this movie. This movie is one of those ""Yeah Right Movies"". The Burgular Alarm being labeled? The Fire alarm, Burgural Alarm, and Public Alarm all in the same system? The thing in the end, that I will not give away in case you dont want to listen to this,? Yeah, Right!I have to admit its has some good jokes but all in all I would suggest moving to Yugoslavia, Try to set the record for longest under water (which is 7 min. by the way), or Visit the White House with 2 machine guns and a rifle BEFORE YOU WATCH THIS!"
5,Happy Texas,"Very funny. I am glad I found it on Amazon.com because it is not an easy film to locate. There are some similarities to ""Little Miss Sunshine"" but Happy Texas is more along the slapstick genre."
5,extremely funny,"this movie is extremely funny, what more do i need to say. excellent story line, great acting. may be one of the best movies you have never heard of."
5,Couldn't Be Happier,"""Happy Texas"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. It has a good natured sense of humor, great performances by all the actors, especially Steve Zahn and William H. Macy, and to see the handsome Jeremy Northam act convincingly as an American convict, while remembering his many roles as an Englishman with an upper-class accent, gives a special buzz to the movie. The little girls of the Miss Fresh Squeezed Pageant are a delight. Both escaped convicts (Zahn and Northam) find true love and the promise of happiness, once they serve their sentences. The story is pure fantasy -- not the way life really is but the way we wish it could be.Everyone with whom I shared this film truly enjoyed it. It's a pity the original distribution of this film was so limited."
5,Hilarious movie!,"When I first walked into the movie theater, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this movie. What I found was a wonderfully entertaining and hilarious movie. The plot is original, the acting is great, and the script is hilarious! I really loved it!"
4,Happy I saw it,"Good fun movie. Kept me laughing, while not always vocally. I particularly enjoyed the character of the sheriff, ""Chippy"" and the situations he put the other characters in the movie in.A highlight of the DVD was the extra footage and the deleted footage that did not make the movie. Along with these two features is the directors reasoning for cutting the footage. Yet another interesting feature was watching the film with the director talking throughout it. The extra features made me feel like a college student taking a film class.I would recommend watching the movie in its entirety first and then checking out the extra DVD features at the conclusion of the film."
4,Funny and not well known.,"This movie is about 2 banks robbers and escaped convicts who think they've gotten a break when the town residents mistake them for pageant coaches. Things quickly get weird for them though, and this movie was what put the finishing touches on my respect for Zahn. It's very funny, but not over the top, despite the premise.Pick up Happy, Texas for a good belly laugh, as it's Zahn's best movie, next to National Security. I've always felt he was far underrated as a comedic actor."
4,Wonderfully surprising,"Ally Walker puts on one heck of a performance I am very glad to have purchased this film bravo to the writer's it is interesting, funny and keeps your attention."
3,"A fun little movie, a slightly flawed DVD","OK, so it was a little predictable in places; but it made me laugh. The acting is good, the humor doesn't pander too much.I'd give it four stars, but once again Disney (Miramax) have botched the DVD mastering, so that the disc erroneously produces an annoying ""multiple angles"" icon throughout the opening sequence. (No, there are no multiple angles.) You can usually reconfigure your DVD player to get around the problem, but it's a pain to have to wade through two or three obscure menus just to watch a movie. I don't know what it is about Disney that they can't get it right; every other movie studio seems to manage."
4,"Original, well-done and definitely worth checking out!","I didn't expect much from this movie after reading the synopsis. I was very pleasantly surprised, however. It is a well-written comic farce, with a great script and a first-rate cast. Along with the inventive and very funny script, there is even a touch of pathos. It was made on a low budget, but it has a slick look that belies its modest origins. This is a captivating film that you will love. I did."
4,"TEXAS HAS NEVER BEEN MORE ""HAPPY""!","When I read the synopsis of this film I wasn't expecting too much, but I was pleasantly surprised by the cast which helped me to forgive the predictability of this off the wall romantic comedy. Macy and Zahn are stand outs in this consistent and funny film, but the entire cast really brings this one up a notch or two. It's kind of like 'Little Miss Sunshine' meets 'Joe Dirt'."
5,Happy texas,"If you want some great laughs, then go for this movie, a bit stupid, but has some hidden warmth and human element in it that makes you want to see it again"
4,"Ultimate, good choice of title","One of my best purchases. Excellent. ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" has always been a favourite. Well worth it."
2,yes i agree!,It is getting ridiculous all these re-issues. It's almost an insult to the fans. Of course it's an effort to get every penny that they can. Let's have some new stuff!!
5,Most underrated album of all time,This is the most underrated album of all time. Can anyone possibly tell me why Suzi Quatro IS NOT in the Rock'n'roll Hall of Fame? Nuff said.
3,Not a bad attempt on a micro budget.,"At times the scenes are poorly lit, the costumes are laughable, and the acting fluctuates from passable to really bad. But, this has charm, a good story, and a genuine love for the golden age comic heroes that the series brings to the modern era."
2,forgot 3 essentails on this album,they forgot 3 other good songs...1 Snow White (studio version sounds alot better than the live version) 2 One More Time (pretty good) 3 Look In Your Eyes (pretty darn good)
4,good or not so good,I thought this novel wasn't half bad then what I had thought it will be. Frank and Joe Hardy take on one of the most difficult mysteries they had ever took on. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes mysteries that are very exciting and interesting to read.by:Andrew
1,It must be a bad joke!,"I went to quite o lot of trouble to get the cassettes and was deeply disappointed when I got them and found out that in two items set, one cassette is completely destroyed - the tape is broken in two pieces and creased. I just can't imagine how a seller can write that condition is good, when in fact it is unacceptable!!! What am I supposed to do with such a ""good cassettes""???? I tried to contact the seller via Amazon, but never got a reply. Thanks again!"
2,The cliff is going down hill!,The worst Hardy Boys book ever.Unlike The Tower Treasure The House On The Cliff is horrible.I love Hardy Boys books a lot but this is one of the worst books I've ever read.I don't know what Franklin W. Dixon was thinking when he made this piece of junk.It was definetly the worst Hardy Boys book ever.
5,House on the Cliff Mystery,"If you have read books like Sherlock Holmes and other mystery books, then this is the book for you. I loved all the action and adventure as Frank and Joe Hardy take on a smuggling case and try to get to the bottom of it. Along the way they find secret passages and almost get caught. I especially liked it when they looked around in the old house on the cliff. What will happen? It's all up to you if you want to find out. Join the exciting adventure of the Hardy Boys. Thomas #18"
5,An Excellent Book,"This review concerns the original 1927 edition. Frank and Joe have a group of smugglers to deal with when they begin an investigation of a reputedly haunted house on a cliff. This is a very well written book with well-defined characters and highly descripted scenes. The mystery is interesting and has a lot of action. A great book, definately one of the best of the series."
4,Fun adventure for boys,"This is a great adventure book for 7-10 year old boys. It develops and moves beyond the character introductions of the first book and quickly unfolds a plot involving smugglers, mysterious dwellings, sudden dangers, and, of course, detective work. It is a fun and exciting read.It's age is perhaps reflected in the villains who threaten but avoid doing too much more, but also by a strong affirmation of family bonds and especially father-son relationships with the heroes openly proud and protective of their parents, and the parents regularly affirming their boys. I enjoyed these books when I was young and my boys seem to be very enthusiastic about them as well. Great to have them available now on Kindle."
1,Revised--don't want,"I hope I am getting the ORIGINAL book, not a revised version.So many of the old originals have been unpleasantly revised that they have lost their original charm.I want the original book in this and other series, such as Nancy Drew and Trixie Belden. How can I tell?"
5,A book for my 10 yr old,"My 5th grade daughter liked the book and read it, by choice, for her Mystery Book Report. I am glad she is getting to know this classic series of books that I grew up on."
4,Good book,Great read just like when i was growing up. i cannot wait to read more of the hardy boys books.
3,OK,"This is an original piece of work, but not one that I would recommend. Lack of organization and rigor are the major faults here. Much better as an intro is Foster & Nightengales' GR book."
2,Girl's photo frame kit,I was NOT pleased with this girl's photo frame kit. It comes with a PURPLE clay for your child's handprint. I would NOT have bought this item had that information been disclosed.
3,not exactly what I wanted,"The product didn't explain that the handprint side wasn't behind a glass. I have these for my first two children, and both had the clay behind a glass to preserve it. I haven't used the product becaues I'm looking for one with clay protected by the glass."
2,Do this yourself,"This product is cheaply made, and isnt packed well in shipping. You could easily make this yourself. The stickers dont stick and you have to glue them"
4,One of the most moving stories I've heard,"Let me start by saying that this was one of the best books I've read in a while. I had the book for several months before I finally read it. The reason for that was because, as they say I ""judged a book by the cover"". When looking at this book, and the abstract, I did not expect to enjoy it. My personal taste is not one that is attracted to futuristic, sci-fi type stories. My expectation was that this book would be just that, what I was pleasently surprised by was that it was much much more than any genre could capture. I was reminded of social issues that I claim to care about, but forget about all too often. I was encouraged to deepen my walk with the Lord and prepare myself and my family for the future of our world, which, whether we like futuristic books or not, is eminent. I would recommend this book to anyone, as long as you are ready to be captivated by the storyline and moved by the reality that it is based on."
5,A Well Organized Defense of Christianity's Historicity,"Dr. Foster uses a logical, well organized approach to presenting the facts of Christianity's historicity. As Dr. Foster puts it so well, he does not ask the reader to ""check their brain at the door"" but instead asks the reader to come and reason with him!After reading Dr. Foster's handbook, I feel more equipped to defend the faith to skeptics. I also feel much better prepared to consume popular media presentations on Christianity and the Bible. The handbook does an excellent job of presenting the various biases that can be present in the popular media and at laying bare the flaws in arguments presented by the media."
5,Daisy the Doctor,"This is a super book about what happens at the doctors office. It's great to read to children to get them familiar with a doctors office and talk about what they do, who goes there and just makes it a much friendlier and not so scary place. Who knows, maybe they will want to be a doctor or nurse who works there? A recommended read to get them to talk about what they see and how they feel at the doctors office."
4,"Tav's billyrock, and all that mess","Tav, that Memphis musicologist, mixes up another batch of spooky almost-had-it hits and echo-chambered obscurities whose titles tell the story. ""What's Wrong,"" ""My Mind Was Messed Up At the Time,"" ""Torture,"" ""I'm Gonna Dig Myself a Hole."" But the real star is Tav's own alter ego, Eugene Baffle, whose four songs here (including ""Vampire From Havana"" and ""Autosapien"" --""you can't tell the man/from his car"") describe some other dimension of weirdness. This collection isn't as consistently satisfying as ""The World We Knew,"" his 1987 five-star collaboration with Alex Chilton, but it's a great companion piece."
4,Decent construction adhesive,"First let me stress that this product is not like liquid nails, if you are expecting something similar to liquid nails then look elsewhere. This is a fine product for stationary structures, but since my structure is a little on the modular side this could have been better, very light with very little initial tack, sets up strong but not for at least 24 hours."
4,Unfamiliar samples and simplistic rythms make Low End Theory,"Tribe Called Quest's second album, The Low End Theory is a breakthrough in the Hip Hop genre. Like most rap albums, The Low End Theory is filled with several samples of artists that have come before. However, Tribe does not stoop to the level of using a well known song to have an instant impact to a commercial audience. The samples in this album are rare Jazz riffs that are unfamiliar to 99% of Tribe's audience. The beats are simple,not overdone and they seem to blend seamlessly with the Lyrics. Rarely does one find an album that is a near perfect mix of the past, present and future. If you love Hip Hop, Jazz, smooth lyrics and a simple beat all with a ""street"" vibe, you'll love The Low End Theory."
4,Great Album,"Some of the best hip hop songs of all time reside on this album. Scenario may be the best hip hop song ever, BUT and the reason for only four stars is that there are some weak songs too. I could go the rest of my life without hearing ""Date Rape"". But get this album get this album get this album."
3,Not their best,"If you like 'Tribe', you might enjoy this one, but definatly don't start with this one. But, if you're looking for a good hip-hop album, let me suggest 'Peoples Instinctive Paths', or '3 feet and rising' by De La. The middle of the original three, and definatly the weakest"
3,"Great music, foul lyrics",Great sounds on this CD. I rate the music a 5. Too bad the lyrics have too much trash and foul language. I rate them 2. Nothing like gangsta rap ofcourse but still too much dissing and objectifying women.
5,The greatest...,"Floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee. The best and smartest rap album ever. Having Ron Carter on bass doesn't hurt ever. Groundbreaking album that took rap in a new direction and opened doors to new areas. This is rap's Sgt. Pepper's."
5,To think of what has become of hip-hop....,"This CD is the greatest in Hip-Hop. I think all tracks can be listened to in succession! Of course, the favorites of many was ""Jazz"" and ""Check the Rhime"". However, ""Excursions"" was a great one as well. Heck, all of them are great. The Tribe with their jazzy sampling created 3 masterpieces in a row, with their 1st, this one and Midnight Marauders. Some people like the Midnight album more, but I think this one has more classics on it than that one. When I listen to the likes of Jay-Z and Nelly, I see a Hip-Hop that is nothing like what it used to be. This is the true definition of Hip-Hop. Sadly, these members have went their separate ways and created monstrosities. However, it may have been asking to much to keep up this kind of greatness."
3,Awesome cd,Hip hop is still alive and it is because of valued and reliable service that is used sustainably and also thank you very much for the speed.
5,Classic,It's classic hip hop I loved 20 years ago. I still love it. I'm glad I have it again. Brings back memories.
5,Not qualified,I'm not qualified to review this product. I just really really like it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hip hop. The other reviews say it all.Fantastic.
5,Outstanding,"When I purchased Low End Theory back when it came out I didn't think much of it. But it grew on me and every time I listen it is still entertaing. The songs do not stand out individually, but as a whole they all fit. Its perfection comes from the low key approach. It rivals 3 Feet High & Rising as the best Hip Hop album ever."
5,The Sickest Tribe album ever,This album rips any other tribe album to pieces. Show business is a dope song along with every other track including Scenario with Busta. Definitely their best album.
1,Terrible Formatting,"I'm sure Thompson's poems are very good, but the formatting of this Kindle edition makes them very difficult to read. It's not so bad if the lines are very short; otherwise, symbols appear in place of letters and words are split without any regard to syllables."
5,Typography 101,"I found this book to be an excellent, well organized, and easy to use tool in learning the history, classification, and organization of type. It is a great text for anyone starting out in the design field as well as for the experienced designer. I never knew exactly how much care and detail went into properly setting type until I got into this book. Mr. Kane has included excellent visual examples and some extremely useful exercises to help illustrate each subject covered in the text. The book flows very well and is a pleasurable read, and there is always something new for your eyes to take in on the next page.I had the pleasure of taking two classes taught by Mr. Kane, and he definately knows typography backwards and forwards. He, as well as his book, is a wealth of knowledge for the aspiring designer."
5,Wartime Horrors,"""Icons of Grief"" is a fascinating critical study of producer Val Lewton's RKO horror films within a World War II context. Historian Alexander Nemerov examines the subtle power of Lewton's low-budget chillers (notably ""Cat People,"" ""I Walked With a Zombie"" and ""The Ghost Ship"") and the cultural reflection upon wartime America. By providing new insights on Lewton and his work, Nemerov encourages the reader to seek out these remarkable films."
2,A Very Hard Toy,This toy is very fun but hard. I cant even beat level one. This toy is only good for kids ten and up.The only thing is that the older kids probaly dont even like Kim Possible. It should be way easyer then then this so the younger children can play with this neat toy. So you can see why this toy is so bad. Now you can see why I rated it so poorly.
4,OK Product,"Colors are vivid on the ornament as seen on the computer screen. Ornament itself is hollow and plastic-like which won't weigh down a branch. Comes with actual hanging thread, instead of relying on a hook"
4,Xmas,"good fun ornament if you like the beatles.Size was good, colour great and perfect for the beatles fan. I gave this as a gift and they loved it."
5,awesome present for beatles fan,"I bought this for my mom and I couldn't be happier with the quality! Awesome gift, super satisfied with my purchase."
5,Prompt Service and True to Item Description,"I cannot say enough how surprised I was to recieve my order early! I've been burned plenty of times by Amazon sellers/resellers who do not care about meeting deadlines for shipping. Not only did it come early, but the item description and icon photo were true to the product. The condition was new, like posted, and unopened.Thank you for your customer service!"
5,Amazing Guide For Amazing Game,The is amazing guide from Brady Games. I loved it. It is in great detail. It tells you how do get everything and the best ways to defeat enemies and bosses.I was never stuck with the help of this guide.I was unsure wether to get this one or Prima's but this one is the best. It comes with the Orcarina of Time's complete walkthrough and comes with a double sided poster. You will never get stuck.It is very helpful. I would never be able to beat the game with out this amazing guide. If you want a guide buy this one. You won't regret it.
3,It's ok,"Not a bad guide but the graphics are a bit hard to follow, several typos and over all not the best guide I've had. And while they brag about 272 pages, 223-271 are the start of Ocarina of Time. I do like the Nintendo Gallery listing of all characters etc., a fun side quest."
2,not the best guide,"They warn you on the back of the book that it is a ""comprehensive"" walk-through..... The good news: all information is there, somewhere.I had pre-ordered the guide together with the game so there was no possibility to check it out. I most certainly would not buy this guide again and am actually toying with the thought to get another. I have bought many game guides over the years and this one suites my style the least in the way everything is structured and laid-out. In some areas is too much text to get to the hint needed but in the process I learn plenty things I rather had figured out myself. I also miss the numbered structure for dungeons with corresponding maps that other guides provide."
1,pointless,"there is no need to waste money on books like this, unless you enjoy collecting them for some reason. all the walkthrough information you could ever want is easily found on the web at a multitude of different locations."
5,Required Reading,"I can't imaging being able to complete this or other Zelda games (Ocarina, Majora's Mask) without some sort of reference guide like this. The nuances and sidequests would just be wayyyy too much for the average Joe to figure out without some help.That said, while there are more ""hints"" built in to Windwaker, the guidebook is a great reference in finding hard-to-find items such as heart pieces, treasure, etc. It also has a pull-out map of the great sea with all of the islands and what can or cannot be found on all of them. This, in addition to the standard walk-through make the guide a great value. Throw in the walk-through for Ocarina of Time (for those who bought the Windwaker/Ocarina Master Quest set) and it's amazing it didn't cost more.Well worth the investment if you just HAVE to have every single item in the game. :)"
4,"A definite ""must get""","Now, like most people, I wanted to get Prima's strategy guide. But after I read the reviews about it, I heard it just gives away the whole story. So I went with this one. It's great. I mean there are some things that may be hard to understand what it's talking about but it's relatively easy to find out matching the pictures with the area you need to go to. Also, this book tells you the items and enemies you will find before every temple. Personally, I don't care that it tells me what I should be looking for. I just don't want to hear the whole story before I'm going to later. So I highly recommend that you get this strategy guide."
2,Poor craftsmanship,The cushion/padding for my ottoman came out of the box looking awful! The stitching isn't straight and is ripping apart before I've even used it. I'm hoping I'll be able to get a free replacement from the company.Babies R Us switched out the cushion for me - I just had to make an extra trip to the store.
4,Great Accessory for Glider Rocker,The ottoman was the perfect match for our new grandsons' and Mommy and Daddy's glider. Not to mention that Grandma liked it too!
1,An attempt at crossing over,"Steady B, one of the greatest emcees hailing out of Philly, attempts to gain mass appeal by watering down his raw skill and Philadelphia style of deliverance. Although he is currently behind bars for being a part of Philadelphia's first African American policewomen murder, his music prior to his attempts to crossover will forever have its place in Philadelphia hip hop history."
1,Inappropriate!!,"I have a three and two year old that have really enjoyed the froggy books. We own several, so when my 3 year old picked out this book from the library I didn't even think twice about bringing it home. However, when we sat down to read the book, I was appauled at one line in the book that talks about pulling down someone's underwear if they are not given candy! This is INAPPROPRIATE for ANY child to say! Who really wants to hear children talking like this? We use to be a froggy fan but NO more frog books in my house!"
5,Great!,"None of the books in the FROGGY series is a disappointment. My five year old daughter has fallen in love with all of the adventures of Froggy, his parents, and friends. The books are just the right length for you and your child to share a nice bedtime story--not too short where you have to supplement with another book or too long where you have to stop and pick up the story the next night. What I like most about the series is that even when Froggy might encounter one of life's little problems or when he gets nervous doing something new, he always learns for the better and knows that no matter what, Mom and Dad are there to help and support him."
4,Funny Book!,"My 5 year old really likes this book and thinks it is very funny. I especially like the scene where the girl from school tries to kiss him (because he looks so cute in his costume) and he has to jump over his parents to get away.As far as the trick or treat rhyme goes, I say people need to lighten up a bit. I remember saying that rhyme when I was a kid and thought it was funny, but I never actually pulled anyone's pants down. When my son and I read it, I simply took a moment to talk with him about how it may be a funny rhyme but we would never actually do something like that. The recommended age is 4-8. I think 4 year olds are perfectly able to comprehend that you shouldn't do that kind of stuff!"
2,Okay..but...One part is inappropriate,"I am a fan of the Froggy series. The kids that I work with just love it. I am very disappointed in this book, primarily because of one verse. ""Trick or Treat,smell my feet, give me someting good to eat, if you don't I don't care, ILL PULL DOWN YOUR UNDERWEAR! If you are familiar with the Froggy books, you already know that the kids usually get a kick out him making references to underwear. In the first book "" Froggy Gets Dressed"". It was cute ( "" You forgot your underwear!) In this book, it may be sing-songy but the part about referencing pulling down someones underwear is highly inapppropriate. It may be a kids rhyme, but it this day and age of sexual misconduct by adults and kids alike, any references to pulling down someones underwear for fun or not, is best left out of the books. It would take just one kid to try to do this to someone at school, because they read that in a book, now you have got a sexual harrassment case going on. Not funny at all."
2,Disappointing,"I got nothin but love for kid rock (as a matter of fact, i think he's so fine!) and so much respect for his music, i think all his CDs rock...except this one. There's just way too much rap and barely any southern rock, rock and all of his other genres he mixes in his CDs. Im not a big fan of white rap b/c the white rock and the black rap but i do like his rap in all his other CDs. If you're thinking about buying this album- I HIGHLY recommend you buy ""DEVIL WITHOUT A CAUSE"", ""KID ROCK"" , or ""COCKY"". Those are my favorite Kid Rock albums."
1,What is this? 5th rate Vanilla Ice????,"I have Kid Rock's album DEVIL WITHOUT A CAUSE and it rocks. I bought this CD and I almost puked. This album is complete crap. I have over 1500 CDs in my collection. Among the 1500 I have, there are some pretty bad CDs, but NONE of them are as bad as this CD. Don't bother getting this album. If you have DEVIL WITHOUT A CAUSE, you don't need anything else. My review, to parody Spinal Tap: SH*T SANDWICHES FOR BREAKFAST."
3,hey idiots,Ok Ill Admit this isnt rocks best album but it was also made in 1990 you cant expect everthing to sound like 2pac ok and the guy who said if he came to my hood shut up cuz u sound rediculous and probly a white boy who wish he was blackandlive in some place like montana and probly cant even spit a verse without quoting other rappers and one last thoughtfor that guy kid rock has respect every were b**ch for the people who read these for info if u like 80s beats and the typical cheesy 80s lyrics this is a good buy if your lookin for eminem style try lil wyte PEACE MUSICMASTER
3,LOL!!!!,"Oh Dear God... I can just picture him with the hair while I listen to these samples. Remember Kid N' Play? Remember what Kid looked like? Oh, to be in the early 90's again..."
5,Very good,For those of you who have put down Kid Rock's new CD you people don't know caca. I am from Los Angeles and I was around when rap first got off the ground. Let me say he has a very good style and very refreshing. He has the ability to rap and rock and make it work.
2,not that great......,"i was very dissapionted when i got this album!.i like rap and hip hop but,this version is not a very good one.devil without a cause and the history of rock is better than this.dont waste your money on it.if you really want it that bad,download a song or here a song somewhere before you buy it.think twice before you waste your money.IM WARNING YOU IT'S NOT WORTH IT!!."
5,Perfect Listen,"In my opinion Kid Rock is a lyrical genius he mixes it with the best rap rock country hillbilly whatever this is definatly a must have it is totally different from DWAC on up bet each of his cd's are think about the style in 1990 and this is right up their definatly party dance music how can you call yourself a music fan if you dont like all music.This is alot like his release with ICP.Check it all out FIU,PM,EMSP,PMR,and bootleg series all worth it."
2,Kid has come a long way,"Kid Rock fans who want to see how much he has matured (musically, that is) should check this out. He kind of was a Vanilla Ice wanna-be back in the day!"
3,Kid Rock's first studio album,"Waaaaay back 20 years ago when Kid Rock considered himself a rapper. Ten years before the Rap/Rock genre was made popular by acts including him, Linkin Park, and Limp Bizkit. Kid signed with Jive Records and released his first studio album titled ""Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast."" Released in 1990, Rap was still considered a fad by some critics at the time. 18 year old Robert James Ritchie (Kid Rock) moved from Michigan to New York City, made relationships with many area rappers and eventually landed an opening slot on a 20-city tour with Ice Cube and fellow Jive/Zomba Recording artist Too $hort. The sound of the album is definitely a bit dated, although, that era is widely considered the golden age of Hip-Hop by true fans of the genre. The album includes classic tracks such as Kid's tribute to the act of cunniniligus 'Yo-Da-Lin In the Valley' and the bragadocious theme 'Pimp of the Nation'. A must have for hardcore Kid Rock fans."
3,OK but not great....,"These burner covers do the job, but are very flimsy. Think disposable foil pans, but with a touch more weight. They may hold pans or cookie sheets on top if you need to extend counter space-if not too heavy, but don't expect a lot from these."
2,Too basic for any kids over 7,"I was originally looking for an older video featuring Laura Stamm & Bob Gainey, hoping this one would have as much basic instruction. This video spent more time behind the scenes at an ice rink than on ""how-to"" skate. Fun once or twice, but now it's in the bottom of my son's closet."
1,Someone else's home video,"The title of and contents of this video are very misleading. This video is absolutely no value for anyone, regardless of age interested in learning about ice hockey. It shows kids in a learn to play program at their local rink. The little instruction that is provided is awful. This is the worst video anyone can imagine about any sport."
4,Very good video for any ice hockey beginner...,"This video came on DVD or VHS at IceHockeyForKids.com, this site sells it for much less and offers it on DVD. Very good for any new hockey player. It also featured how they make ice, paint the rink, how a Zamboni works featuring Mr. Zamboni, equipment needed to play the game, basic skating skills. The DVD offered unique additional footage such as the USA & Canadian hockey anthems, and other clips not found on the vhs. I thought it was pretty cool, my kid likes it too!"
3,Mediocre film saved only by Ray.,"A Ray Charles vehicle in which Charles, while on tour in London, visits a school for the blind and in the process befriends an eight-year-old fatherless blind boy named David. Sensitive to the boy's position, Charles proposes to have David examined by a skilled surgeon in Paris who might be able to restore his vision. David's mother, perhaps overcompensating for David's disability, has grown accustomed to her position as caregiver and is adverse to the Ray Charles proposal. This position not only threatens the emotional development of her child, but also her relationship with her lover, a Jazz musician/composer. Looking very much like a semi-engaging made for Television drama, BALLAD IN BLUE is of primary interest for the music of Ray Charles who provides several live renditions of his songs including ""I Gotta Woman,"" What'd I Say,"" ""Hit The Road Jack,"" Hallelujah I Love Her So,"" and ""Let The Good Times Roll."""
2,Undeserved Reputation,"While I am, as a historic costumer, extremely disappointed in this book, I would say that both its good and bad reputations are undeserved. The drafting and construction instructions are horrible - true. However, the first-time Fairegoer, beginning sewer, school play's costume department, and those interested in the look without the substance should find this useful. This is NOT a book for anyone interested in accuracy, variety in research (HOW many times will I hear someone tell me that their gown is of ""dead Spaniard color""?!), or correct cutting and wearing of the clothes. In short, this is a book for making costumes, as opposed to working garb or reproducion garments.Caveat emptor."
3,"Not bad for ""Ren faire"" costume, but not always authentic","This is the book that a lot of people start with when making clothing for Renaissance Faires or for the Society for Creative Anachronism. For creating ""Renaissance-ish"" costumes it's not bad. However, I've read some fairly harsh criticism online about its instructions for assembling a woman's outfit, so caveat emptor aut lector, so to speak. Those who are looking to accurately recreate Elizabethan clothing should probably look elsewhere (e.g., Janet Arnold's ""Patterns of Fashion""). This book occasionally uses techniques and ""cheats"" that have no historical basis whatsoever. For someone who is simply interested in making something that looks more or less correct this is a great book, with the previously mentioned warning that some of the directions may lead you astray. I would just be aware that this is a book about making ""costumes"", not ""clothes"", regardless of what the authors say in the preface!"
2,Winter and Savoy: History repeats itself,"In this, the second edition of this book, an introduction is included stating that mistakes were corrected as per the complaints of past customers. I see that the ""so clever"" corset pocket on the bodice pattern and the oopsie recommendation to wear your bum roll under your corset still stands. All in all I would not recommend this book to anyone but a beginner or intermediate costumer, and only then if they have done enough research to recognize when there is useless info included. This book may be useful for someone who simply wants a costume to wear to Faire, and wants quick cuts to the finished product."
2,I recommend this book,"If you want to be a Princess in the historically detached fantasy world of the North American Renaissance Faires then this book provides easy to understand instructions for newcomers to create their dazzling costumes. For the serious costume historian seeking to pinpoint pitfalls and historically inaccurate costume cliches, look no further. Here they all are gathered in a single volume.Either way, this book should find an honored place on your bookshelf."
4,Great but not perfect,"I love this book. It is a good beginers guide. I used it along with a commercial pattern to make my first outfit. Granted it was not exactly like an original item from the time period, but I still got a lot of compliments. This book really helped me. I am currently working on my second project and I took hints right out of the book. If you are new to sewing and want to make a great costume for a festival, highschool theater production, or even Halloween consider this book."
3,Amazon Cancelled the order,"Never got a shipping confirmation, so we emailed Amazon. About 3 hours after we got an email that said ""rest assured your order shipped on July 31st"" we got a second email that said they couldn't find this product anywhere so they were canceling the order. We were counting on getting this camera before we went on vacation.I gave this 3 stars because I'm sure the camera is great, but the service was bad."
1,Ugh! So Disappointed!,"After reading the other reviews here, I eagerly purchased this camera (about a week ago). I've taken more than 200 photos, and I've been so disappointed! I have had several digital cameras over the last seven years, and I have read the manual for this camera cover-to-cover. I have experimented with the many modes and settings, and yet three out of every four pictures I have taken are blurry or out of focus. Even in full sunlight! And any low-light pictures are totally unusable! The features seemed great, but the photos are terrible! My experience has been so different than others have described here. I will be returning this camera as soon as possible."
2,Great camera - while it worked ...,"I bought this camera as a Christmas 2006 gift. It worked perfectly out of the box. Took great pictures. It was the right camera for what I wanted it (carry along for snapping photos for blogs and Web sites). Then, suddenly, the shutter that covers the lens won't open when the camera is turned on. I reset the camera in the hope that the problem will go away, but it didn't. So, great camera while it worked, 4 star photos. Reliability: Zero."
1,Save Your Money,"I purchased one last year and thought it was great, then this past May 2007, I purchased 2 more. One broke just outside of the 90 day labor warranty and Panasonic wants $95 flat fee to fix it, of course that doesn't include parts since that is still under warranty. The original one, which is now about 18 months old will only take indoor pictures. For some reason, as soon as you try to take an outside one, the camera goes black. The indoor pictures have lines all throughout the picutes. This one is out of warranty all together. The only one left is one of the two purchased in May. If I were able to get a refund I would. The picture quality on this camera is getting terrible. No matter what setting I have it on, they pictures look great on the computer, but if I get them printed out, or I print them out, they are grainy. Do not waste your money on this camera!!! I would never buy a Pansonic again!"
2,Too Slow camera,"I bought this camera because I read Imagen stabilization, really you can move the camera and the photos looks good, but the only problem that I see in this camera is a very slow record when you take a pìcture, I had a sony DSC-W5 and this camera is much faster than Lumix, I don't known why the persons in the previous reviews didn't report the slow record, but for me is unacceptable this condition. I will going to resale this camera."
2,Loved it until it broke,"It took the absolutely best pictures of any digital camera that I have owned (4)...and then while taking pictures in my garden, it froze and stated that I needed to turn it off/on...I did and it said, replace batteries (which were new that day, honest...I had taken only 10-20 photos before it crapped out)...It turned off with the lens extended and it won't focus. I called up for the one year warranty...that is a one year PARTS warranty, no labor, so I am sol.Great camera, until it died. They told me that you have to put the exact same type of batteries in it every time. I have never done that with any electronic device before."
3,A gift for mum.,Purchased for my mother who has always listened to her. So I grew up listening to her too. A good find
4,Helpful and informative,"Our book club, The Islanders, chose this book to read last month because so many of us are facing the problem of caring for our aging parents. The book is well written and humorous, and full of important information for anyone who is concerned about providing a safe home for their parents. We all agreed that we wished the book touched more on the specific problems of dealing with Alzheimers and dementia, since many of our parents will be faced with these problems eventually. Also, the authors mentioned nursing home insurance, but didn't recommend any particular policy or company. There are so many confusing come-ons in the marketplace, that it would have been a great help if there was some information on comparing and evaluating policies. We felt we learned a lot about what we will be facing in caring for our parents, but would love to read more about insurance policies to cover nursing home services."
4,Extremely helpful in my late middle age for my own life plan,"A wonderful humorous yet serious book about a hard subject for all of us; even those of us who have already lost our parents. I especially enjoyed the delightful illustrations.B. C. Taber/ Marlborough, MA"
5,Excellent,"Many CD's that label themselves as ""Blues"" may only contain 2 or 3 tracks that the majority of people with any kind of rhythm would call ""bluesy"". This CD is one of the noted exceptions. While it is not the hard guitar, I lost my woman blues that is all over SRV's ""Bues at Sunrise"" (another very noted exception to the above), this CD is truly a blues CD by a woman that knew what the hell she was singing. Even the faster cuts (few on this CD) seem to keep a painful bluesy feel to them. This is certainly a gem in my ever-growing collection."
2,Didn't happen.,This tape is supposed to increase eyesight and get you to see auras. I have listened many times and nothing has happened yet.
2,Keep Looking,"This is primarily a picture book featuring a number of Egypt's archaeological wonders. There are, however, also brief written descriptions and explanations of some of the major sites in Egypt.The pictures are fine. (I wonder, though, if other books don't provide much of the same material.) The writing and editing, on the other hand, are quite poor. The site descriptions are rather dense reading, but strangely fail to convey much information. The writing style, such as it is, appears to change - rather jarringly - on several occasions. Perhaps most troubling in a book of this sort, however, it is often difficult to match the photos with their intended captions. This is not a high quality resource. Though I have not examined what other Ancient Egypt resources are available, I am quite certain you can do better."
4,The labors of a housewife -- now and then,"Boydson goes to prove that the average woman ha had to work long and hard hours that have been often under paid and overworked while the men get their payment, the women must endure long hours and work extra hard. This book seeks to tell how the women have built the economy and have been one of the major leaders yet do not get the credit that they deserve. Think about the long hours put in spinning, canning, and doing the house work without air conditioning and yet still how it is today! This si the book to read for all historians."
5,Human Drama The World Inside,"I had no problems with this CD. It plays great, and the case was in great condition too.I am very satisfied."
5,Excellent!!!!!!,This book was the best book i've read in a long time. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It deserves more that 5 stars! Its hard to understand at first since its in code but once you pick it up you will not be able to put it down! If you have to choose one thing to read have it be this book!
4,Good value,Table and chair were shipped very quickly. The price was much better than any of the big name toy stores. Table is a great size for toddlers and chairs are sturdy.
5,Just what I wanted!,"I ordered this to use at the office, for when our 2-year old visitor is at play, there. She was able to sit in the chair and pull the table up close to her body so she could sit and use her new pretend tea set, and have her toys on a table she can use. It was a big hit with her."
5,Great gift..,This is a great item. My grandson enjoys his very own table and chairs. I would recommend this for any toddler...
3,Little Tikes Classic Table and Chairs SetLittle Tikes Classic Table and Chairs Set,"Waiting for Christmas day to see how the ""Little Tikes Classic Table and Chairs Set"" will be received. Box looks pretty small for a table and 2 chairs...."
5,GREAT TABLE AND CHAIRS FOR LITTLE ONES,"I have not bought this yet, but I am going to order two for my grandchildren for Christmas, who will both be two years old. I bought this exact same table and chairs except the table is a different color. Even the yellow chairs are the same. I have two sons that are 22 and 23 years old and I got this for them over 20 years ago. I have done some babysitting over the years for friends and so I held onto the table and chairs. I finally got rid of the chairs about 3 months ago so we could paint and lay new carpet in the house. So after 20 plus years the chairs had to go. I don't know if they make them like they use to, but it's Little Tikes and they are a great company. If you are thinking about getting this item for your child, I say take a chance. Even if it doesn't last 20 years...it's still a great deal. Happy shopping."
2,Little Tikes Classic Table and Chairs Set,"Really not what I expected. I got this for my two year old. The chairs don't have much support to them so he's mostly falling off or tipping over on them. The table is only big enough for one toddler with a coloring book. Table and chairs are both light enough for toddlers to turn upside down,side ways, etc. Thought it would be more sturdy considering the price."
4,It's OK,"I bought this table for my 2 year old son. When he first saw it, he LOVED it! But I guess the ""newness"" wore off and he isn't too excited about it now. I bought it so that he could eat and not have to sit on his knees. He rarely eats there. He would much more prefer to sit at the grown up table. I will say that it is durable. On occasion he will ask me to sit there wit him while takes on whatever task. I was a lot apprehensive to sit on one of those plastic chairs. But it held up well. I have sat on it a few time and it didn't cave in. LOL!!! All in all, it was a good purchase. Maybe he will use it more as he gets a little older."
5,My son loves it!!!,"My son loves this table. The chairs are the right size. This is light weight, yet, very sturdy. My son uses it all the time. Great buy."
5,Little boy loves it.,My great grandson is a year and a half. He wanted to sit right down and eat his lunch. He needed help getting in the chair but I am sure in a few months he will be able to manage by himself as he gets taller. It was a nice switch from his highchair and he felt like a big boy.
4,A great starter table,"If space or money is tight, or if you just don't want to get a fancy kid's table, this is a perfect table. It's lightweight, which is it's main drawback, as a kid can slide it around unintentionally. However, it's amazingly sturdy (we have it against the wall), and I suspect our daughter could stand on it without breaking it. The chairs are also very sturdy, evrything is built with really big posts and thick plastic, so it's tough. We didn't put that sticker on the side, so it looks a little better. There's a slight sloping lip (about an inch) around the edge that stops crayons or pencils from rolling off. It wipes clean and disassembles easily for storage or travel. Frankly, it seems pretty indestructable, andf my 19 m-o daughter loves it."
2,Slides around everywhere,"This is a cute table, but it's so light that it slides around all over the place. My 2-year-old son likes eating snacks at the table, but when he leans against it, it slides away and he stumbles. Same thing with the chairs. It's just not really practical to have this table slipping and sliding all over the kitchen. I'll be looking for something more sturdy that actually stays in place!"
2,Not very beefy,"I bought this hoping I would get the warmest of the warm because it was 900 fill. Turns out my 12 year old cheapy Columbia jacket has more substance. This jacket is very light and dainty. I live in Montana and was hoping for something a little more utilitarian. It has no inside pockets. I've only worn it a couple of times and have noticed down feathers making their way out of the super thin fabric. When my dog jumps up on me I'm terrified the fabric will shred to pieces. I will have to wear it under my protective shell to keep it safe. It is very attractive. However, I wouldn't want to depend on it in seroius weather. There is just nothing to it, and it isn't very warm. I can't believe I spent so much money on a thin layer to my winter clothing."
5,An emotional 'dusty drive' to the depths of sublimity,"Being that this is one of my favourite movies ever, it is hard to believe that I watch it primarily for the music, which can haunt the deepest of souls. On numerous occaisions I have found myself watching the climax and credits of the movie over and over again. Definitely in my top three with 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Platoon'"
3,Great in the movie. So-so on the CD.,"A true test of a movie composer is how well his/her music stands up without the movie around it. James Horner's ""The Place Where Dreams Come True"" makes my spine chill, but I realized it's because I wanted to see Ray playing catch with his dad, not for the music. The other tracks are a bit slow and boring. I can listen to most John Williams soundtracks all day because his compositional skills are the best in Hollywood. While James Horner has written a beautiful theme for this movie, it sounds way better as the background to a great movie. Not as a compositional CD."
2,Dissapointed !,"I don't understand why people spend a lot of time topraise this score as ""excellent"". It does not deserve it. If youwant to enjoy James Horner best score, I can show you : The Legend of the Falls."
5,"Wow, this one still makes me remember...........","I remember sitting there, in a darkened lobby of a hospital room in Joliet, Illinois. My grandpa was dying of cancer in the next room and I was a sad sixth grader who needed some escapism, and fast. I remember watching Field of Dreams that day but, most of all, I remember the music and how it blended so perfectly with the film. It was the first time I ever cried during a film.Call it a classic case of a young kid needing to vent a little, but I will always remember the relief that film brought to me. Years later I bought the soundtrack and with it came the memory of my grandfather.The music on this cd is poetic and spell-binding. If you are on the verge of buying this cd, let me allow myself to give you the friendly push that helps you decide.Even if you are one of those countless folks who considers Kevin Costner a bad actor, don't take it out on the musical score. This cd is a dream, pun intended. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
2,"The designs are not good for much enlarging. The book is printed out with a computer printer, and doesn't seem archival at all.","The info is good. Good designs, but not very archival. The book isn't professionally done. I wouldn't spend the overpriced amount they want."
5,This Book Is Good...!,This book is good... maybe too good! The very essence of my being can't describe the awesomeness of this book. In my years of book reading I have come to the conclusion that this book FREAKIN' ROCKS!! But really... it's got a lot of designs (actually that's the only thing it's got).. but the designs rule!! So if you're lookin for a book of designs BUY THIS ONE AND ONLY!
4,Another great installment to music.,"I first listened to their second album, I am hollywood, and loved it. Now hearing this blew me away. This is a great cd, and is a fun album to listen to. Ever song packs a punch and keeps you interested.My favorite song would have the be Scream Toots, but all are enjoyable. If you like Emo, or Hardcore, this cd is a good blend of both"
3,It's alright but it's got nothin on I Am Hollywood,"Overall a grittier album as a whole, with more of the hardcore influence shining through than on I Am Hollywood. I just can't dig the voice when he starts singin all crazy on here, but then again I've never been into hardcore that much anyway. Some songs work surprisingly well though, such as : Suave, The Fool, Down In A Crypt and Either They Decorated..."
5,Earl Klug's Fan,"I bought this CD only to replace my vinyl LP. So....I already knew it was a very, good CD. To those not familiar with his music try it -- you'll like it!"
2,Where's the bass?,"I am sorry. But I found this version utterly lifeless. There was no bass. The string bass and bass drum play an important part on Beethoven's symphonies, so why make them barely audible? And keep in mind: I have a very good subwoofer! I much prefer Manze""s version on the Harmonia Mundi label. Buy something else."
5,College text.,I had to buy my this for a college class. The shipping was fast and it was in very good condition.
3,"Hair today, gone tomorrow","l don't like him, l don't like his politics, l don't like how he inconveniences others in the name of justice but more to get his fat face on TV. BUT l L0VE THAT HAlR!!!"
4,Will make you laugh and think,"The Rev. Al is quite a character. His views on hip-hop music, Bill Clinton, class struggle, and other issues are quite a hoot, but even when you don't agree with him, he makes you think. As the Rev. Al holds forth on the various issues of the day, this book will date rather quickly due to much of the subject matter as is the case of most books on current political events. But take a trip through the mind of Rev. Al. You'll laugh and you'll get mad at points, but you will think afterwards."
5,Good value but no game rocket,"After looking around for a good all around PC for e-mail, corrospondence and a lot of still photography we landed on this one.My teenage son says the video card is too slow but he has his own purpose built game machine and the graphics on this box are way more than adequate for the Photoshop intensive use I put it to.The card reader on the front is a wonderful touch for us photographers as is the DVD burner. The machine has all the I/O's any sane person could want.My employer just bought a load of dual processor Xeon HP workstations for video editing and the build quality on the HP machines was so good that I hoped some of the magic would have rubbed off onto the Pavillion line.So far so good.Better, I think, to get a computer that has been ""spec'ed down"" to meet a price point as opposed to one that has been ""built down"" to keep the sticker low.A well built workhorse that won't send you to the poor house."
2,Don't Buy,"Have had many computers, this is the worse. The fan noise is horrible. Slow and undependable. It's a disposible pc for sure."
4,exactly what we needed,"So thankful for resources like Amazon! We realized the week of our daughter's wedding that our large-capacity camcorder battery was dead as a doornail, and none of our local stores had it. The battery arrived quickly on Prime and saved the day!"
4,A good chronological account,A crisply written account of rise of terrorism in Punjab and its relationship with expatriate community. A Non biased and well researched book which provides insight into Sikhism and Punjabi roots and current reality of 80s. Highly recommended to get facts straight.
3,No answers and too many errors.,I've just finished chapter 7. I find a lot of errors in the examples and waste a lot of time when my calculations don't match the book's.I bought a 6th edition for $6 to study prior to the class. It isn't very pretty but it does have answers to odd numbered questions. With the 7th edition you'll have to go to the website for the answers and many of them are incorrect. I've simulated them on Pspice to prove it.My suggestion is to buy a 6th edition... unless pretty pictures help you learn more. The text is identical and the practice problems are generally the same but in different sequence.The tutorials on the website mharis.com are very good and I highly recommend them.I depend entirely on the book and the website for all my learning and think it's actually a pretty good book. Generally I can learn from the book pretty easily. My opinion may change when we get to the more complicated stuff. Overall it's pretty good but could use some improvement.
2,Engineering circuit Analysis,"This book was required of my circuits class. It's explanations are pretty good and the diagrams are good too, but it's hard to mess up circuits. The one thing I truly hate about this book is that it does not have any answers in the back. I would really like to know that half of the problems that I am doing are correct, so that is very frustrating. Overall, an OK book, but it would be a great book with answers to odd or even numbered questions in the back."
1,Terrible,"The book contains left out diagrams, and incorrectly solved homework problems for starters. Also, the book has no solutions to the odd worked problems. Furthermore, the authors tend to give simple examples in the text and then give extremely difficult homework problems at the end of the chapter. Lastly, the book has a very bad and vague explanation for passive sign convention that will leave you suffering for the duration of the text.If you don't have a good instructor that is willing to fill in the gaps that this book leaves, then chances are you will do poorly in your first circuits class."
2,Not good,"I have both the sixth and seven additions of this book due to my school requirements. Unfortunately, this book goes through rigorous methods to show proofs for almost every equation. The author wastes a lot of time and effort when you could be shown approaches to analyze the circuits, instead of deriving equations. The book offers a few simplistic examples and then expects you to come up with some serious insight and solve end of chapter problems that they left you unprepared for. Fortunately my instructor had a very straight forward approach to the subject which made the class not so dependent on the book. Otherwise I would have never gotten anything out of my circuits classes. I have also purchased a few supplemental circuit books and although none of them stood out as spectacular every one of them presented the material with more clarity."
1,Worst EE book ever,"I've taken a DC and an AC class with this book. If the goal of the author is to confuse you, and not help you understand how to dissect a circuit, then they have succeeded. Stupid stupid stupid stupid book. Why does my college use this dumb book. I took a similar class (not for engineers for technicians) and it did a MUCH better job at explaining the material. It was step by step and didn't leave you in the dark. Stupid McGraw-Hill and stupid college and stupid professors. Electrical engineering (dc and ac) is mildly hard (this is an intro class) but this book makes it near impossible...unless you can read the author's mind. There are no solutions in the back of the book to make things worse..."
4,Heavy Duty,"Very solidly made product. Finished and polished nicely, feels good in your hand. What is most important gets the job done."
5,"Cover Design, Energy, and Content","This is a strange story set in the mountains. I first read the manuscript as a galley proof. John F.Blair, publisher, asked me to do the book jacket design. Even though I only read it twice -- once to get the energy from the book for the cover design, and the next time for the story. Even after all these years, the energy of the book is still with me. It has a mysterious quality that lingers on in the consciousness. I feel that it is a story that makes a lasing impression. tt extends ones awareness beyond words."
5,SHE'S TOPS!,--superb rockin' soul pop folk music.--tunes often with a plot. Perfect.--and what a band!
5,One of the best recordings,This recording has been a friend for many years.Does not wear thin.Captures a time and energy that few recodings are capable of.Listen to that deep Joan voice and it will speak for itself.This cd stands above all her other recordings.Enjoy!
4,sounds great if you're in love or getting out of love,"He was so in love with me during the 80's and I was unsure; we played this ""album"" in 1986 endlessly. ""Down to Zero"" was my favorite. I left him in 88. Earlier this year I heard this song on a drama police show and old memories made me cry. Now, I will have to get Joan on CD."
3,Let's Get One of Chet's Better Albums Instead,"This album is not a fitting memorial to Chet Baker's musical gifts. Nominally a soundtrack to Bruce Weber's moody, atmospheric, but ghoulish meditation on the deterioration of Baker's boyish good looks, the album features a bored and burned-out Baker singing standards and very rarely blowing his horn. This was the first Baker album I owned, and, although I liked it, it served for many years as something of a deterrent to exploring his catalogue more deeply. Weber's film and this album foster an erroneous impression that Baker's talents, like his looks, were largely dessicated by the late '80s. In fact, some of his finest playing and most soulful singing appears on his later records. Skip ""Let's Get Lost"" and buy ""One Night in Tokyo"" (1987) and ""The Last Great Concert: My Favourite Songs Vol. 1 & 2."" You won't be disappointed."
1,Shoes ruined after one slow night,"I wore these shoes to dinner once. I knocked the heel against a dining table chair and the more than thin fabric ripped. The other shoe heel similarly ripped during the course of a two hour, very sedate dinner, sitting in a chair doing nothing out of the ordinary. I have three other pairs of Arche shoes. These shoes are by far the worst as far as durability. Why would you pay Arche prices for shoes that are so quickly and easily ruined? I will never buy Arche shoes again. The quality is no longer there, and there is no excuse for the fabric on the shoe tearing so easily. Will you buy these shoes?"
3,Super Kid!,"Subtitled ""A Tale of the Spanish Main"" this is an enjoyable book with lots of history easy to digest and learn. Ned Hearne - a brave, intelligent teen from Plymouth meets English privateer Francis Drake (not a ""Sir"" yet) and his adventures begin. Along with three friends (with each of whom he has an improbable, but stirring adventure) Ned takes along through the Elizabethan years and events leading up to the Spanish Armada and the subsequent fact of Britannia becoming the preeminent sea power. History can be fun!"
4,Fuel for the imagination!!!,"I read this out loud to my 11 and 8 year olds. They both LOVED it! G. A. Henty has true eloquence with words, which I enjoyed, but the kids were just drawn in by the adventure! This was our first Henty novel, but it won't be our last! What a great way to learn history."
3,Of limited interest to US Army Veterans of the 1950s,Ms. Hoehn's account of the integration of American troops and the German civilian population is a scholarly treatise of the Rhineland-Palatinate in the 1950s. It is difficult reading but contains interesting information for those of us who served contemporaneously in that locale.
3,"Long on talent, short on technology","While the scrpt and performances in Philby, Burgess and Maclean are excellent, the quality of the DVD recording itself leaves much to be desired. Still, if you are interested in (a) spies, (b) the cold war, (c) nuclear secrets or (d) all of the above, this is a good movie to add to your collection."
2,Rather dreadful DVD.,"This is a review of the production and the quality of the DVD. Firstly, the screenplay comes off with an almost sympathetic view of the main characters, one even lamenting that there was no turning back, as if he had just made a simple error when young and now he had to continue through with it. The acting was okay and the homosexuality of some of the characters was acknowledged. I can't say how accurrate the storyline was, but it did seem a rather truncated version for what apparently went on.The quality of the DVD was very bad. It was very cheaply transfered and it shows. The image was rather muddy and looked poorly as a whole, but when areas of the frame became dark the picture would go haywire and turn green and pixelated. Needless to say that this poor image quality definately takes away from viewing pleasure."
2,weak film,"Although Bates is quite good as Philby, and the scenes in which he parries questions from his low-key but penetrating inquisitor are well done, overall this film is disappointing. Only for those who must read or see everything about the Cambridge spy ring."
2,Not what I expected,"It was hard to tell exactly what the toy was based on the photo but since the reviews were so good (and it was pretty cheap) I decided to purchase it anyway. To be honest, I am not impressed and neither were my cats. I was not surprised that my 15 year old cat was not interested. Give him a string and he will play for hours. Other than that he does not like much. However, I expected my 4 1/2 month kitten to love it. Nope. He will dab at it a few times but quickly loses interest. Instead, he likes to bat at the occassional pellet that they track out of the Breeze Litter box. Go figure!"
4,Great product,"Very simple toy, stiff metal wire with paper tied to both ends, you hold one end and it moves back and forth because it is not a string but just a long pice of metal wire, you would never know somthing this simple could be so effective. My cat loves this toy its amazing how simple it is and how much my cat goes crazed over it.. its like crack to him, you will see your cat jump and chase after this. I was surprised how effective this toy was, we own may toys similar to this one bought at the major pet stores, after buying so many toys and not seeing him interested I decided to purcahse this one based upon the reviews..at the moment we definitely got our money's worth! My only concern is that is made of a metal wire, nothing has happened to him and we only use this toy supervised!"
3,"Great, but could be improved","My cats absolutely love this thing, and I have to keep it stored away when we're not playing so they don't tear it apart or hide it somewhere. However, I can't help but think that a little bit of ergonomic design could improve this toy dramatically. The ""handle"" is merely the same rolled up cardboard as the the ""play"" end, and when you're playing with the cats for even 10 minutes, I immediately get some kind of cramping of the fingers and hands. Now, I'm only 28, so I don't think I have arthritis, but the way you have to manipulate this thing to move about requires a lot of effort, and the thumb and index finger just wasn't designed for that amount of stress. Now, if this wire was attached to a larger wooden or plastic handle, I would give it 5 stars. As it is now, only 3."
5,all time old time favorite,"I cannot say enough about how much this toy has entertained my many cats over the years. .....so inexpensive too. Holding the wire so that it curves UP is even better for play. They only get to play with it after they have allowed me to put on their harness that I am training them to adjust to, so I can walk them when I travel.I make sure that every day there is play tie with cat dancer. I drive 2000 miles in 3 days twice a year and they need exercise during this time as they are confined to their carriers, so walking on a leash is important. This toy is the trigger I use to get them into their harness, walking mode. NOTHING ELSE WORKED!!"
1,This toy can kill!,"I made the horrible mistake of leaving this toy out one night. The next morning my husband found my poor cat tangled up with the toy (wire)wrapped around his body so tight it blocked blood supply. We rushed him to the Animal emergency. Our dear Sparta had to be put down . To much damage had been done to his internal organs from lack of blood supply.I blame myself for not being more careful but It was a cat toy and should be made safe! Cats love this toy,but it's not worth it. Accidents can happen to easily . Please beware."
3,cat toy,cats loved it but we felt it was a bit dangerous for our children to use. wire is tight and could cause injury if not held properly
2,Cat Dancer - Not for my cat,"This is just a piece of flexible wire that has cardboard attached on the ends. My cat turns her nose and back on it. She's very curious and to have her ignore this toy, I'd say - Not for my cat!"
4,"Good toy, awkward to handle","My two cats love it, for now at least. They get bored with any toy after a while. Anyway, the cat dancer is a hit with the cats, but not with my fingers. I wish the side with the 'handle' had something a little more substantial to hold on to, I end up with the wire digging into my fingers after 15 minutes of play. My girlfriend agrees with this assessment.For the price, though, I'm not complaining. Inexpensive fun for happier cats."
5,A truly great cat toy,I had one of these years ago and it got bent and no longer worked so good- glad I got a new one- my cats are wild for it. Abbey actually comes over to remind me she needs to play with it- I keep it between two pillows on the sofa and she will start looking around the pillows for it. You get lots of action out of the cat for very little energy expenditure yourself- it bounces back when they play with it and drives them wild. The other cat prefers it to be dragged along the floor but she too is a happy camper when it is out. Get your cats one of these- they will thank you. If it can get my 10 year old big girls moving it will work for any cat.
3,Not a Fan,"I have to say, I'm not a fan of the Cat Dancer toy. I get the simplicity of it, and my cat was entertained, but it's a safety issue for me. She tried to bite the wire a few times, and if I left it laying around, I was afraid she'd get tangled in it. I bought a toy similar to Da Bird at a local pet store, and like it a lot better. I'd def. consider that over the Cat Dancer 101.Da Bird Cat Catcher Cat Toy by Go Cat Feather Toys"
5,Cat Dancer 101 Cat Dancer Interactive Cat Toy,"This little toy is the best! My cats absolutely love it! You would never think so by just looking at it, but It is definitely worth the $3. My cats just look at most toys, but they play with it even if I'm not holding it!"
4,Affordable simple cat toy,"My cats went absolutely crazy over this toy. My biggest problem is maintaining a good grip on my end, I may need to attach it to a little stick for better control. But for the absolute simplicity and fantastic price, I would definitely continue to buy this toy for my kitties. They couldn't keep their eyes off it and loved the erratic movements. I got tired way before they did!"
1,Cat dancer.,"I bought this for our 9 month old kitten. Unfortunately, he shows no interest whatsoever in it. I've tried moving it in all different ways. He looks at it for a few seconds then walks away to play with other things. Our older cat isn't even curious about it. I'm sure some cats would love this, but it's not for ours."
1,I felt like an idiot when I opened this package...,"After all these glowing reviews, I decided to spend the equivalent of a Starbucks and order my cat this toy. What a waste. When I opened the box, it was a piece of wire with cardboard at each end. But, again having read the reviews, I thought, well, let's give it a try, perhaps the wire will awake some primal hunting instinct. Wrong. My cat looked at me like ""You've GOT to be kidding!!"" And I realized I could have made this toy with a simple trip to the hardware store. I say spend a little more money and get your cat ""Da Bird""...Da Bird Interactive Feather Cat Toy - Easy Store / Pull Apart Rod... he or she will LOVE it!"
3,Another one bites the dust.....,"I was hoping that my Maine Coon would love this but he's not interested at all. I even fastened a plume of feathers dusted with catnip on the end and he just walked on by it when I tried to engage his interest. Seems that the breeds that are more apt to hunt, need something more stimulating to satisfy their urge to peruse, like laser toys."
1,wasted ten dollars,it is just a thin wire with some tiny cardboard tubes tied to each end...probably fifty cents worth of material if that. My cat batted it a little but didn't care for it much. She loves the 4 dollar soft material strip on a long stick much better and will go to her basket of toys to tell us when she wants to play with the other. the cat dancer toy was a waste of money.
3,"Cat enjoyed it too much, had to throw it away","I literally just had to throw this away because one of my cats became aggressive towards my other cat and people when he had the toy, and it was difficult to get away from him.Both cats really enjoyed playing with it until the one got weird, so you may be fine if your cat isn't prone to being eerily possessive. He's never done that for any other toys though...."
2,My cat couldn't care less for this toy,"Not that I blame the toy per se, but really? 4 buck for a piece of wire with tiny cardboard rolls? And my cat doesn't even like it."
3,Not a big fan,Don't see whats so great about it. I felt it was cheap. Just a wire. THe edge seems only 4 peices of cardboard. Was not able to make the cat interested. May be its me. Lots of people seem to like this. However we got the 301 cat bird catcher.Our Cat loves it.
5,"Fun, simple and cheap","There is not much I can add here that hasn't been said already. My two cats love this and play with it for long periods of time without losing interest. This, and a simple laser are their favorite activities."
5,Buying this toy for years,"Years ago, a friend recommended I get this for my kitten, her cat loved his. Not only did the kitten love it, the older one did as well. I bought a new one every few years for them since they do wear out. But I hadn't bought one in years since the ""kitten"" is now 15 and is not much interested in anything but lap and nap time. I've recently acquired new kitten, a stray, who is full of energy. I remembered this toy and was happy to see amazon carried it. Sure enough, the new baby LOVES it! It seems to simulate the flight of a bug or butterfly and will have them jumping and turning to get at it. When you see it you will wonder why you spent $ on cardboard and wire but will probably find it was worth the few bucks."
2,Not worth the money,"I found this toy very lacking and not worth the money. My cats do not like to play with this. Very short and cats are not interested in ""cardboard"" which is on the end of toy. don't bother"
5,Cats LOVE this SO much!,"I was worried this toy would fall apart the first day, or that my cats would end up hating it.They LOVE this toy so much that they are jealous when taking turns with the one I bought. I had to buy a second one so my two cats could play at the same time (they hate playing together with toys for some reason).It is kind of hard to tell how the toy is from the pictures, but it is a piece of wire, with little cardboard like rolls at the end and one on the other end for you to hold onto it with.Worth every penny it costs, and holds up great. This toy is more fun than the string toys for cats, because it kind of bounces around on it's own, plus when the cat hits it, it bounces around more. Provides more interaction and is less work on your wrists to keep it moving than the sticks with a long string."
5,Like a Sporadic Fly & Bouncy Too!!!,"It is so cute its movement is sporadic like a fly ! My Cat loves it! I love it too because he is so cute as he's playing with it. Great toy at a great Price! Definitely recommend. Don't let its simplicity fool you - my cat goes nuts over this! Like any other toy you let your cat play with, you should first check it and supervise there play. I do not leave toys out except for a select few, everything else gets put away when Stashu is done playing with it. This wire is a nice heavy wire with cardboard on the ends. Just keep an eye on the wire ends and look for wear and tear. It tells you right on the packaging to throw it away when it gets worn. The best thing is its Sporadic Fly Movement!!! And Bouncy too! Too Cute!"
2,My cats didn't give it a second glance,"Although there are a lot of good reviews about how other people's cats loved this item, unfortunately mine did not. I tried dangling it in front of them and just setting it up, but they didn't seem to care. They usually like toys, just glad this one wasn't too expensive."
4,Cheap toy provides tons of fun for kitties...while it lasts,Luckily this is an inexpensive toy. We had purchased one before this & my cat & 2 kittens loved it. They loved it a little too much & chewed off all the little strips of raffata in a matter of 2 weeks. Hopefully this next one will last longer! Otherwise a decent value for the cost.
5,The most fun you'll ever have for $3!,"Seriously, this is the simplest thing on earth, but my cat Beatrix likes this more than the $30 toys she's had in the past. No end to the HIGHLY entertaining kitty acrobatics! She's a 20lb beast, and she's flying thru the air after this silly thing! At $3, I'd buy more than 1...the little cardboard bits won't last forever. Though we're a number of weeks in with daily play and she's not managed to destroy it yet. She's already leaner and much more feisty...like a younger kitty...she really loves this toy! And a sidenote, I have issues with upper body movement, and this thing is super easy to wing around....takes almost no effort to get it bouncing for her, so its great if you've got mobility issues or back pain.Buy it...fabulous cat toy, and can't beat the price!"
1,Bonks cat in face with stiff wire,"I'm no genius, but neither am I a moron. This toy invariably ends up bonking my cat in the nose/face. It consists of a fairly stiff wire with a lure on the end of it. The wire allows the cat to swat at the lure and have it spring back; however, the wire is pretty invisible and often nails my cat in the face. I'm tossing my two into the trash in favor of softer toys on a stick."
3,Could be trouble,This is a simple idea that the cats love - I'm just not entirely comfortable waving around a piece of metal.
2,Save your money,This thing is a piece of stiff wire with cardboardy paper bits on the end. My cats sniffed and batted a few times. They occasionally chew on the paper part. Save your money.
1,Worst cat toy ever.,This toy is a waste of money. It is just wire with cardboard attached. My cat would not even acknowledge it was there. This is not worth ordering.
3,Depends on the cat,"I've had four cats over the years. Two have gone absolutely bonkers for this toy, and two have been like, ""What else ya got?"" Worth getting to see what your cat thinks, since it's not expensive."
5,The Best Cat Toy,"I have bought my cat many elaborate toys, but only this piece of wire with cardboard attached to the ends can drive him crazy.Be sure to buy a few of these at once, because cats tend to chew the cardboard off."
5,Our cat loves this,We were very skeptical of this toy but thought we would only be out a couple bucks if our cat didn't like it. She LOVES it. It keeps her entertained and running around for a long time with very little effort on our part.This is a must!
2,Not interested without addititves,"I bought this product because of the great reviews, but my cat was totally uninterested in this toy. He loves other toys similar to this one, but just was not interested in the bouncy pieces of card board at the end of this toy. I went ahead and attached a feather to it and that peaked his interest, but he still prefers the ones on the rod rather than this wire. I guess it just depends on the cat."
2,Mildly amusing,"Cheap toy that consists of a wire with a little cardboard strung on the end. Wire seemed a bit short, and has the potential to cause injury if not used with care. When you use the toy you can hear the wire whizzing through the air, I am sure it doesn't feel great if your cat accidentally gets smacked with this. My cat is mildly amused with this, play time is short lived. There are better interactive cat toys to invest in. You get what you pay for."
5,Cats can play by themselves!,"I ordered one of these for $2.30 and free shipping with Amazon Prime - I figured, what the heck, try it out... I have 3 cats, two of them being about 7 months old, and one of them 3 months old. All of them are NUTS over this toy. I have to admit, I was a bit ""underwhelmed"" when I opened the package - a wire with some twisted cardboard on it...? But, my kids play with the boxes their toys came in - the cats aren't any different! For awhile, I would hold the wire myself and wobble it around. Then I got the idea of fastening one end to a wrought iron baker's rack by weaving it through the wire designs and bending it out and away from the rack. Now the cats bat it around by themselves when I'm doing other things - I can hear the ""BOING"" of the wire against the rack all day long - they wear themselves out!! I've ordered 3 more of these to attach to their tree/condo! Fun stuff!"
4,The Cat is in Love,"My cat loves this thing. If I use two hands, hold the end with my left, and put the right one about 8 inches higher, I can use my right hand to move it forward and backwards really fast. When I do this it really wiggles and looks exactly like a moth. Needless to say, he goes nuts. He could watch this thing for hours. Unfortunately, I can't spend hours moving it around. The only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars is because I'm not sure how safe it is. I would never leave it out for him to play with when I'm not around and try not to let him bite on it for too long."
5,WOW,It is so simple that i couldn't believe she would be attractive to it but she is.The cat dancer works better for her but this was also accepted for here.
1,Hooked! Literally!!!,"I had one of these. The ""fur"" slid around on the loop & my cat got the hook caught in his cheek!!! NOT A SAFE TOY!!!!"
2,Remember Mom Warning You Not to Poke Your Eye Out?,"My cat loved this toy but he only has one eye and I'm not about to risk him losing the other one when the metal ""fish hook"" accidentally pokes it out. If you use this toy make sure you throw it away as soon as the cardboard starts to disintegrate, which it will relatively quickly. I seriously believe this is a semi-dangerous toy, especially in the hands of an annoying rugrat who will swing it around like a bullwhip and be poking out cat eyes left and right."
4,Best cat toy for the money,"This is probably our cat's favorite toy...well worth the $4 or so. It's cheap because it is simply a thick wire with a couple little cardboard-like pieces on the end. With the spring like nature of the wire, it bounces around and the cat loves to jump after it. Sometimes he will also just play with it on his own and toss it around. Would reccomend, especially for the price. Our cat enjoys this more than some of the ""fancier"" toys we have bought him."
4,Our cats love it!!,"One corner of our living room is filled with cat toys of all shapes and sizes...lots of sponge balls, balls with bells in them, faux fur mice, faux fur mice on faux fur sticks, turbo tracks, fancier turbo tracks and then I bought this Cat Dancer. I must admit - it's beyond simple and they love it. They chase it and jump and if I didn't get tired so easily, they would be playing with it for longer than they do. I would not leave this toy laying around because it is made of wire and small wads of cardboard. You have to use it to get them to play with it. When the cardboard wears out, the toy will need to be replaced, but it is inexpensive and if you buy it with other items, the shipping would probably be free, so if your cats like it, buy a couple next time.I am going to try and do a short video of them playing with it, especially our big 18# Lynx Point Siamese/Tabby mix - he's a riot to watch jumping up to catch it."
5,Highly Effective and Indestructible!,"This simple device provides hours of interaction and exercise for my high maintenance rescue kitty. I don't know what the ""woody"" part is made from, but it stands up to the fiercest claws and teeth!"
5,Surprised by how much by cats like this toy.,"I was really skeptical when I saw this toy in the store, but since I had read good reviews on here and it was on sale for $1.50, I decided to buy it. My 3.5 year old Siamese cat has always enjoyed toys, but I haven't seen him get this excited about a toy since he was a kitten. He gets annoyed with me if I put it away and he's not done playing with it. He even jumps up to try to catch it which he doesn't do anymore when I try to get him to play with the sticks with the feathers on the end (which he loved when he was still a kitten). I just adopted an 8-week-old siamese mix who also loves it. If anything ever happens to this toy, I'll definitely be buying a replacement, which I can't say for a lot of the other cat toys that I've bought. Definitely worth every penny!"
4,Our cat likes this toy.,"Our 3 1/2 month old Bengal kitten likes this today. It keeps him busy for a little while but he prefers Da Bird. Also, this toy is steel wire which tends to bounce too much and smacks him in the face."
5,All 3 of our cats love this one!,"Time to buy a new one, as I pulled it out after a while and it's 5+ years old, they all loved and went crazy for it. I think there's a bit of a learning curve on the human's part to use it correctly. The love it in the air or on the ground, just be patient and learn how to control it. This toy is great as you can try and hold it very still, but it's on a wire so there's always some movement and that's part of what makes them go crazy for it, before the full on chase. Ingenious design, cheap and versatile. PRACTICE! Turn the wire upside down so you can flutter it like a bug.Cats are very different, so I wouldn't post a negative review of any cat toy just because my cat didn't like. We have some that love one, but the other couldn't care less. This one, they all love and it's a bit more than a can of good can food so why not?"
3,cats like it,It is a very simple concept that is actually a pretty good idea. All 5 of the cats in our house love playing with it. Not a bad price for what you get.
5,My kitten goes bananas for this toy,Length:: 0:28 MinsA picture is worth a thousand words...or in this case a video. My 18 week old kitten goes crazy for the cat dancer. I have never met a cat that is immune to its charms. ALL cats love the cat dancer. It is amazing. And with Amazon Prime free shipping? You seriously can't go wrong. Get a few of them.
2,Just an okay toy,"I thought my cat would like this toy as much as other pole toys he loves. Eh, he really did not go for the Cat Dancer like I had hoped. I'll stick with the Da Bird."
5,my cat's favorite toy,"My cat absolutely loves this toy. I couldn't believe how much she was interested in the little pieces! As I noted after another post, once the little pieces got destroyed we attached another small cat toy to the end and she still got some enjoyment out of it."
5,"It took some time, but.. WE LOVE THIS TOY!","It took my cat a little while to warm up to this (though she was interested the very FIRST time she saw it)--=now she loves it. This 13lb, 12-year-old cat's typical idea of play is to lie on her side and bat at a string dangling in the air. The cat charmer is designed that, with effortless movements, it really WILL charm your cat!"
3,Purchased as add on for free shipping,This item is very highly rated and I am not sure why. It's basically a coil of sisal suspended from a thin wire. Cats played with it a couple of times and then got bored.
3,Good for a short period - worth the couple bucks,"Simple wire toy was a BIG HIT for the first week and then like most things, interest waned. Not the toys fault though! :o) After a couple days I attached it to the top of a scratching post with furniture pins so they actually use the post more now since they will wander by and bat at the wire briefly and then scratch. Probably like most toys they would rather I was the one wiggling it for them ALL THE TIME and that would peak their interest again. I would recommend getting one as long as you can do it for under $5."
5,they love it,"for whatever unknown reason, the cats really love this toy. Even my cats; one is too old to play, one is too lazy and doesn't really know how and one is just a hidey cat (the one who loves to play); they all play with this toy as soon as I bring it out. It's great. I do wish it had a longer handle so I could use it more with the hidey cat but I'm sure I can improvise something."
3,"Interesting toy, but be careful!","I couldn't wait to play with my cat after I got this toy. Well, he IS interested, but I AM worried. The rolled cardboard pieces are pretty stiff, so when the cat runs after it and inevitably crashes into it, I feel as if I were constantly about to poke his eyes (it did hit his face numerous times due to the unpredictable bobbing motion of the wire). The end of the wire is also exposed, and since I need to let my cat ""win"" from time to time, once he catches it, he will chew on it, and it's potentially dangerous (what if the cardboard piece comes loose and the wire end becomes a hook?!!). In addition, since the wire is not long enough, I can't comfortably stand up and play with the cat (I am 5'3"" and have to stoop a little when I need to drag it around the floor). A good concept, but I find the flying feather stuff much more to my liking, and much safer."
3,Can't hold a candle to her favorite toy.,"After reading numerous reviews about how cats are nuts for this, I was hopeful to distract my kitty with this toy. Because of the spring steel wire, it looks easier to play with while watching tv, etc.However, she half-heartedly plays with it a few minutes and then just sits there with her usual expression and special meow which means please play with my favorite toy instead. So I have to get up and pick up an old tie-string off an old pair of shorts and drag it around the room and then make her jump in the air for it. She could very well do the same with this wire thingy, but not interested.I never learn. I keep wasting money on toys, when she only loves the free ones. The other free one is a wadded up piece of paper she bats around the room. I shouldn't complain. If I didn't keep buying toys, I'd be saving money.However, that's just my cat. Maybe your cat will fit in with the many glowing reviews."
5,Best Cat Toy Ever,"The Cat Dancer is, without a doubt the best cat toy I have ever used. The cats love it and one of them even drags it around the house attempting to convince someone to play with him. I have not yet, met a cat that did not like it."
5,My cats favorite toy!,"My cats love this toy even more than a roll of toilet paper! It's so fun to play with them with it. And unlike fabric toys, I can get it away from them pretty easily when they catch it."
4,Nice product depends on your cat,"At first I couldn't believe that I had spent 4. Dollars on a piece of wire holding up rolls of cardboard, but the reviews speak the truth. I have two adult cats, one very frisky and energetic, one more calm but still playful. My frisky cat took one hard swing at it, and the wire flew back and smacked him right in the eyes! He's now deathly afraid of the toy, even if it try to show him it's okay to play with. However my other cat loves it, she likes to hit it and ducks and watches it swing, and so on. Hit with one cat and unintentional miss with the other, it just depends on your cat and how they play. All in all, a good, entertaining toy."
5,Intro to Albert Schweitzer,"""Here is the essential core of Schweitzer's voluminous writings. Out of his twenty volumes Dr. Joy has culled, with rare discernment, the brief selections which enable any reader to understand Schweitzer's philosophy of life."" -- Religious Book Club""Dr. Joy's cogently assembled 'Albert Schweitzer: An Anthology' probably is the best introduction to him"" -- New York Herald Tribune"
1,The Dove,"The product was totally inferior and could not be viewed. The seller operates under several different names to sell poor products through you, eg supergvideos/rentalvidsr This is the second time I have ordered a video through ""Amy"" and neither one was viewable. It was ordered 10/16/2011 and as of 01/12/2012 I have yet to receive a promised refund."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Based on a true story out of the National Geographic magazine, this film is a worhty rendition of the original story. Slightly over-dramatized, with some very cheesy soundtrack tunes (along with a couple decent ones) there is some really awful acting from Bottoms and his beautiful co-star. Yet, a must see for any hopeless romantic that has a sailing fetish."
3,Search-Light,"This thing is great if you need a small and inexpensive search light, or if you are designing your very own portable Bat-Signal. This thing is way too bright, especially if you have a shiny floor like ceramic tile. It lights up the whole room. I can see it even through my eyelids. If you are looking for something bright this is your product, if you are looking for something more subtle then forget it."
4,2 True Classics,"While most of the tapes that Coliseum video put out are complete waste of your time, this tape is an obsure classic. This is the only place you can see Bret Hart's first title win, and the first ladder match in WWE. Both of these matches are classics, as you would expect from any combination of Bret Hart, Shawn Micheals and Ric Flair.Here's the match list:Berzerker vs. CrushRepo Man vs. EarthquakeBert Hart vs. Ric Flair (WWF title)Bret Hart vs. Shawn Micheals (ladder match)Bret Hart vs. KamalaRazor Ramon vs. UndertakerYou should buy this tape immediately."
5,Double Revenge,"Not the best movie out there...but not the worst either. The acting holds your attention and the plot is rather good. I gave it a 5 star because of the actor...Joe D. However, the other actors do a good job also."
1,Bad Product - Olympus camera,"The camera malfunctioned after only two uses. After researching it, it looks like its an error due to a lens/scope malfunction and will cost nearly $200 to fix."
4,"Love the camera, hate the battery door!","We've had this camera since April 2006. I've been extremely happy with it overall. It's light, easy to carry around, has a fast shutter speed, decent zoom, reasonable price, and takes pretty good pictures.However, my battery door broke. My friend has the same camera and it's happened to her TWICE. Each time it needs to be fixed Olympus' customer service charges a flat rate $105 repair fee and then they try and get to to pay them an extra $x to upgrade to a newer version of the camera you already have. It's a total racket. Although they won't tell you this directly, you CAN order a replacement part and fix this problem yourself. I was able to find one online for twenty-two dollars, including shipping and it was very easy to replace. I hope this helps someone! :)"
5,great product,Very speedy delivery. A gift for my daughter. She loves it. I thought we were to receive a free photo card but did not. Not really necessary. Did not know that. Still playing with it and having a blast. I do like that it is weather resistant.
2,Fuzzy Picture Quality,"I love everything about this camera but the image quality. Although the camera has a built in guide that not only tells you how to take the best shot, but automatically adjusts the settings to the correct mode, most images are fuzzy, especially if printing anything larger than 4X6. This Olympus camera has so many marvelous features from the large size LCD to the slim, light shell, that it is a great shame the image quality is so poor."
1,"Average Pictures, No Viewfinder.","The latest trend in point and shoot cameras is the lack of a viewfinder. This makes taking pictures outdoors on a sunny day nearly impossible. If you actually want to know what's going to show up in the picture, this camera is virtually useless in sunlight. You may not use the viewfinder on a digital camera very often but, when you need one, it's frustrating not to have one. There are better cameras, with a viewfinder in the same price range.Indoors, the camera takes average pictures. The colors are somewhat washed out and at lower resolutions the pictures are a little blurry. On the positive side, the stabilizer works well and pictures at higher resolutions are generally clear and sharp. The included software is cheap junk meant to sell you an upgrade."
2,Poor and fuzzy pictures!,"I bought this camera back i May, and since that it has been send in to repair twice and I got a new camera. I regret buying this camera! Even though it has more than 7 mp. the resolution is so poor. Some of my pictures come out red. Scary. I would buy a Sony or even better a Canon. Canon has more features also like black and white pictures, view finder etc. I just spoke to Olympus for the 6th. time today, and they're not willing to help. Take my advice, so you don't miss out on pictures from your anniversary, trip to Europe, Halloween and so on like I did!"
5,Love it!,"We haven't had a chance to try out all of the features, but for our everyday use we love it!"
4,Fine Camara,"-This camara picture quality is Nice, and depend on user purpose. My gf is kinda satify with it.-Function is easy to use.-Battery life is so so.-Battery charger design is not convenience. You have the put the battery into the batter charger. recommand to get a cradle charger, but extra cost. It should sell with cradle charger."
1,Long-time Olympus Customer -- Very Disappointed,"We have been long-time Olympus customers when it comes to digital cameras. Our first was the D490. Our second was the Stylus 400. On the strength of our previous purchases, we did not hesitate to get the 710. We have been extremely disappointed. Just about every picture we have taken (at the highest quality setting) have been blurry and far below the picture quality of the 4 megapixel camera we used previously. We sent the 710 back to Olympus because we were convinced this was a problem with our camera. Olympus wasn't particularly interested to hear that we were loyal customers, said it replaced the lens, and we saw absolutely no difference when we received the camera back. Unfortunately, we have now taken 6-months-worth of very average-quality family pictures. We will buy a Cannon or Sony in the next week. Sorry, Olympus, but you have now lost us forever."
2,Big Disappointment,"I was very disappointed with this camera. The description says it has a digital stabilization mode but you couldn't prove it by me, as so many photos turned out blurry. Another huge problem was its slow shutter speed, as time after time, I would lose a shot when friends using other cameras and snapping their shots at the exact same time as me got their photos.One important consideration: the camera does not have a view finder, only the LCD monitor on which to center the image. Perhaps I'm hopelessly old fashioned but I really missed the view finder as using it helps to stabilize the camera and makes centering the image so easy. It takes steady hands to hold a camera at arms length, find and center an image and click the shutter--no wonder the shaky photos. But perhaps the worst failing of the LCD monitor is the glare factor on a sunny day. It makes it very difficult if not impossible to see any image on the screen."
2,The LCD screen breaks easily & not worth the cost to fix,Same as others with the breaking LCD screen what a bummer they should do some sort of testing with pressure placed on the screen and have to meet a minimum force to break. I like the camera other than that. Slim and long lasting battery user friendly It would have cost $130 to send back and replace the screen I can get a new one on e bay for that so I won't buy Olympus cameras any more. I am going to try Sony now.
4,Olympus camera,this is a nice compact camera that connects directly to your computer via a usb cable and no additional software needed. consider purchasing a sd card for additonal memory
4,"very nice, but.....","broke after 5 months of limited casual use. Something in the lens mechanism broke. Sent out for warranty fix. We'll see how Olympus handles this. I hope well because my daughter really likes the camera. Look, feel, ease of use and great pictures! I'll report back on the outcome"
1,Returned two with problems,"I thouht going with Olympus, I'd get quality and innovation. I thought wrong. The first camera had a crack in the screen right out of the box. After returning I used for just a couple of weeks before a flash malfunction, which eliminated indoor photo's. Photo's were frequently out of focus and images taken with slight motion was blury.Don't waste your time thinking that this small camera will be a good pocket camera, it won't. What it will do is break and disappoint."
5,Get this Olympus!,"The Olympus 710 is one neat camera! Small, easy to use, GERAT resolution, good controls, and excellent documentation.The one drawback is using the preview screen to frame the picture in bright sunlight. It is sometimes extremely difficult to see what you're shooting.I like the convenience, being able to carry this camera wherever I go, and get pictures I might otherwise miss is a real plus.If you're looking for a good, yet relatively inexpensive digital camera, I fully recommend the Olympus 710."
1,broken!!!,"i got this as a present back in october of 2006. it broke 3 months ago!! only 9 months of limited use. i am so upset. when my boyfriend bought it, it was $350!! now, it will cost $150 to fix and its worth $150 now. i called olympus and because we dont have the receipt, they wont take it in. they need a proof of purchase, i said the camera is the proof. i have the warranty card, the box, everything except the receipt. i will NEVER buy an olympus again. the customer service are extremely rude and they dont even back up their product. dont buy this camera- you will be sorry."
2,Ergonomically designed to fall out of your pocket,"I bought this camera in a hurry because my other one unexpectedly broke. I don't like going anywhere without a camera. This one is ergonomically designed in a slight wedge shape making it easy to fall out of your pocket. I caught it before it hit the ground. Whew! Further, it is small so if you have large hands you probably don't want this one. The pictures were quite sharp. The viewing screen often whited out in bright, contrasty lighting situations and seemed unable to make a decent exposure in these conditions. I consider that defective. I took it back and got a thoroughly excellentCanon PowerShot A630 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoominstead. Very satisfied with the Canon!"
4,ok for me,"im an ocasional picture taker...so im fine with the picture quality, pics look great to me! only 1 problem...after 3 months of use...it broke down becasue the lens failed to open so it would not power on, it displayed some error codes on the screen, but i sent it to olympus, and they got it fixed in no time at no charge...camera is in great working condition now, if it were not for that problem, it would have gotten 5 stars...another minor complaint is that it does not always show battery power, setting these things aside...it is a great, nice, small camera that will satisfy any customer like me."
2,very disappointed,"I bought this camera after having a Casio Exilim EX-P600 because I wanted something smaller, and liked that it had image stabilization and was weather resistant (important for camping, etc). However, in comparison with my previous Casio Exilim, I have been extremely disappointed with the picture quality - except for outside in bright, indirect light, a good 2/3 of the pictures are blurry and/or incredibly grainy. While its size means that I almost always have this camera with me, I am frustrated and disappointed every time I load the pictures onto my computer."
2,Don't be fooled by the glitz,"I owned an older Olympus digital camera and the thing I hated the most about it was that it took forever to snap the photo. My subjects would often not be in my picture, would complain about posing or I'd just miss the shot. I loved it otherwise and bought this one. I couldn't believe that it had the same problem! It took forever to snap! I returned it and bought a Canon ELPH and am much happier. The Olympus did take wonderful picutes once you finally got them!"
5,Great value,"I was looking to buy a new digital camera before going on a study abroad trip this summer. The Olympus Stylus 710 seemed to have the most features, smallest size, and most megapixels for its price range. The camera was great for my trip, I had plenty of opportunities to use the many different scene settings and it was extremely easy to carry around. I love that I didn't have to worry about getting it wet and after being shoved into my beach bag constantly there is not a scratch on it. The LCD screen is huge and makes sharing pictures with others easy since I have yet to get my photos developed.I love the camera, but it does have a few disadvantages. First, there is no view finder, which I didn't think would be a big deal, but it makes taking pictures on sunny day more difficult. Secondly, the zoom on the camera is not very powerful, but I would much rather sacrifice that for it's small size."
4,Good little camera!,"Good size display (no viewfinder); doesn't take up much space in the pocket or purse; produces nice clear images and the 7.1 megapixels allows for generous enlargements with plenty of detail. The ""on-board"" help screens are actually informative and helpful: ask the camera about how to shoot a back-lit scene and it tells you on-screen and then asks if you want the camera set that way for the next shot. Not a ""professional-grade"" camera, but no complaints here for snapshot use."
1,yikes,"This book was horrible for AP Euro, it was not in chronological order and often confused our class. Also, he skipped over some events that were important to know for the AP exam."
1,Very Dissapointed,The seller didn't send me the book. I even send 2 emails asking about it and he did not response. I need to get my money back.
4,"A bit too much info for Intro to Western Civ, sadly","I am not joking. I wish it were realistic to use this textbook in an intro to western civ class for students with no previous knowledge, but it's too complicated. It's also hard to lecture with it as it jumps around between national histories (keep having to say, ""when last we left English history..."". I would like to use a text like this one but am convinced that it is simply too much for our average students."
5,Rate my Seller,The textbook arrived earlier than I had expected and the book was in great condition!
4,soooo good,"this album is magnificent. i only gave it four stars because its not that PERfect kind of album that you can listen to alll the time... in any mood (such as ""if your feeling sinister"" by belle and sebastian). all in all VERY good though. as an album... it is better then their new release ""chutes too narrow"". i usually skip the first song... but after that its all good, especially ""new slang"" and ""past and the pending""."
5,the new slang,"I love this album. This is the best music I have heard in a long time(aside from jack johnson/ben harper). ""New Slang"" is a tune that, as well as being highly addictive, is so good it might be the best song I have ever heard. no joke."
5,An instant favorite of mine!,"I bought this album based solely on the clips on this page, and those clips don't even do the album justice. The first song may have taken a little while to grow on me, but the rest of the album was instantly stuck in my head, and in a good way, not like that song by The Darkness (somebody needs a severe beating for that one). I don't think there's a bad song on the album, and I highly recommend it."
3,"""Shin""toism","10 stars for ""New Slang."" I fell under its spell the instant I heard the first few bars and lines on the radio. When Natalie Portman insists in ""Garden State"" that Zach Braff listen to the song because ""it'll change your life,"" it seems out of left field and, objectively, at least a bit hyperbolic, but I'm right there with her. It feels like some contemplative, magical, earthy Celtic dirge with hooks that fix into your very soul.The rest of the album I really can't listen to. It has an entirely different sound to my ears, alternating between a Beach Boys-reminiscent vocal and those poncy Britpop bands of the '60s. But I will give it a few more tries just based on ""New Slang's"" mesmerizing brilliance."
4,Indie rock at its apex . . .,"I first heard The Shins when I watched Garden State a while back (Great movie). ""Caring is Creepy"" and especially ""New Slang"" are such catchy (not in the annoying radio pop way) songs, and they were stuck in my head for days. I picked up the album and was pleased by the album's atmosphere which projected a mellow mood, yet far from boring. The melodies are soft, sliding, and stimulating. The Shins are essentially indie popish rock that touches a little on folk and exerts the basic majesty of 60's psychedelia. The lyrics are unique, being poetic in their own right, and as the songs grow on you, so does the band overall. Outstanding tracks are ""Caring is Creepy"" ""New Slang"" ""One by One All Day"" and ""Girl Inform Me.""You won't be disappointed."
4,"It's Good, but...","it's no Chutes Too Narrow. A little rough around the edges, but nothing the band couldn't fix up for their second full-length. The best two songs on here are definitely ""Caring is Creepy"" (just hauntingly beautiful) and ""New Slang."" I like this disc, but Chutes just blows it out of the water, turns it on its head, inverts it, if you pun."
3,This album is pretty good,"It sounds to me like these guys are borrowing heavily from Pet Sounds. So if you're a fan of Brian Wilson, you might want to check this out."
2,Not very original,"I can't say that I've heard music exactly like this, but it didn't impress me much. Other reviews I've read in music mags and newspapers gave this album pretty decent ratings. I'm bored with it.I liked the Shins in Garden State.I don't much like them in this CD.Maybe I just don't get it."
3,the benefits of being a belle and sebastian rip-off,"okay, so am i the only one who thinks that these guys are exactly like Belle and Sebastian but not as good? They are. But they do a dead-on impression, and it's pretty okay -- i mean, i'm a big fan of Belle and Sebastian. All i'm sayin is if you don't have Belle and Sebastian, you should skip this album and go buy ""if you're feeling sinister"" or ""the boy with the arab strap"", but if you have a lot of B&S and you're thirsting for more, then by all means try this. i listen to it, i just wish someone had told me this in advance."
2,Not Good...,"If this is going to be a classic in the future, music truly is in a terrible state. I found it to be an ok album, but not the great masterpiece others have indicated. This is definitely one to listen to at a listening station before buying (or listen to some of it here.) Some people think music has to be strange to be good. I think it at least should have some sort of entertainment value. This cd has none. I gave it 2 stars because it isn't the worst cd I've ever heard...just not one of the good ones."
4,WOW! Great Album,"Why haven't I heard of these guys? They're the best band I've heard in years. They sound kind of like the Beatles, Kinks, Simon and Garfunkle and Brian Wilson, all rolled into one. James Mercer's vocals soar into the stratosphere. I guess the guy never went through puberty... Anyway, it is a shame that these guys haven't won a Grammy, because they kick butt over anyone who won this year. It can only be a matter of time before they make it mainstream, which means you should probably listen to them now, so you can say ""I knew them when."" If you like music with melody, great vocals and enough hooks to hang a month's worth of laundry, then do yourself a favor - buy this CD."
5,Took two listens to fully appreciate it,"I had heard a couple songs from this album that I liked and had previously purchased their album Chutes Too Narrow which I liked quite a bit. With that setup my first listen of this album, while I liked it, was actually a little bit disappointing. Definitely less polished than Chutes Too Narrow (though that album may be a bit too polished) and I felt that only the two tracks I had heard before really stood out. I was going to move onto something else, but decided to let the player go for a second listen of this CD and it was with that second listen that this album really ""clicked"" for me. One great track after another. If you liked Chutes Too Narrow definitely get this one too, but give it two listens on your first sitting."
4,"Some great songs, some not so great","There are about five songs on here that deserve five stars, but the rest are about 3's in my book. I really like, ""New Slang."" Also, the lead singer's voice gets irritating sometimes, but all in all a decent album to chill to. That's another one of its slight problems: Is it a party disk or a chilling disk, or a drive in the car disk? Is it emo or progressive rock? Post punk or rock? It's hard for me to put a finger on it. That can be a good thing and a bad thing. I am looking forward to hearing their next album. I bet they define themselves more and more in the years to come."
4,Who would not love this?,"I was reading reviews of this cd when I came across this sentence in one of them:""I felt what it must've felt like to have been a WHO fan in the 60's when they came out with a new record, I felt genuine excitment!""Which promptly made me add it to my shopping cart. Oh my god, this is such a great record! I wish I could have been a WHO fan in the late 60's, because I love the sound they had in that period. I can't believe these guys aren't British. This is just.....Very Nice Music To Listen To. I keep playing ""One By One All Day"" over and over, and now I'm starting to LOOOOOve ""The Celibate Life"" Jangly? Yes. I love jangly. It gives me a happy feeling. Buy this record, and just listen to it all the way through once. It will totally grab you by your lapels and slap a smile right onto your face."
4,Om Shin Riko,"Pretty good and I think more production values would not make much difference here. ""Wild Honey""-era Beach Boys, Nilsson, the Shoes are reference points I guess; also some '70s junk like maybe America or even the Ozark Mountain Daredevils, somehow. The Shins could cover ""Jackie Blue"" I think. However, it's not great. I've heard a lot of music like this in my lifetime and when it's all said and done you still can't beat the Zombies or the Left Banke or Brian Wilson at this kind of very fragile thing. Plus Brian Wilson wrote about watching TV and eating and so far I am not sure where the Shins stand on these subjects, altho I like the line about the Birmingham mall. But for young people under 30 who revere the great wistful pop past, it's probably a whole brand new bag and so forth."
4,Pretty good,"If Blur wrote the soundtrack for HR Pufnstuf or the Bugaloos it would sound like this. It's spacy, dream pop but quite likeable."
4,"Albuquerque, New Mexico's best kept secret?","One day last year, I ran across this particular CD at the library and decided to borrow it. I liked it so much that I went out and bought my own copy! What can I say about it? Well, if you love happy-go-lucky, 60's pop type music, then The Shins are for you! Songs like ""One By One All Day"", ""Know Your Onion!"", and ""Pressed In A Book"" are sure to set your toes tapping! Catchy and infectious, Oh, Inverted World is a disc you'd want to play again and again. The music is in some ways very reminiscent of the Beach Boys and the Beatles. James Mercer and company are very good at what they do! I'm already looking forward to their second disc!"
2,borrrrrring....,this record is boring and has zero sexy appeal. id stick to straight nyc rock with bands like Bona Roba and The Plums.
2,This album kinda bites,I had only heard the song caring is creepy and it is really good but then i heard the rest of the album and it wasnt anything too special. Save your money and download it because its more fun to do something when its illegal!
2,Arty music that's confusing,"I had a chance to see these guys live not too long ago, but I figured the set they played would be too wimpy.So I chose to stay home.I mean, with songs like ""The Celibate Life"" and ""Your Algebra,"" how exciting could a live set by The Shins be? NOT VERY!! To be fair, though, I have heard this record, and the gentle sounds are poppy and pleasing - especially if you're trying to cut back on your sleeping pill dosage.These guys have talent, but they're a bit too ""arty"" for my taste. For real rock, check out Metallica!!Cheerio!!"
3,decent retro-pop,"This album isn't the most amazing piece of music ever composed, but it is decent if you find yourself lost among the pop-rock racks at your local music store and are frusterated by the complete absense of substance and creativity. It is a throwback to the guitar pop of the 60s and 70s, and has a weird, erie, yet slightly goofy feel to it. Comparisons can be drawn to the Beach Boys Smiley Smile, and some of the wackier Beatles stuff. While this isn't the best of the indie/""garage"" rock on the market today, it is certainly better than the mindnumbing alternative."
2,"Oh, what's the big deal?","After reading several reviews for this disc I bought it expecting something refreashingly different and creative, but after listening to this I am wondering what the fuss was about. It simply doesn't come up to par with the horde of alternative/indie music that i have purchased over the last decade. Their acoustic sound is nice at times and yes the sound is different, but the vocals are apathetic. The lead singer sounds awful at times, nor can I understand a damn thing he's saying. Just listen to the sound bites above. The New Slang is by far and best effort on the disc, everything else just falls short of expectations. If you like this acoustic sound check out REM Fables of the Reconstruction, much much better. If your a big fan of the New Slang check out The Stone Roses self titled disc. Listen to this disc before buying, don't let the hype cost you money."
3,Like Elliott Smith...,"...on Prozac. So: I play the whole thing through repeatedly instead of turning it off midway into the second song! Exuberant, light-hearted, catchy, and somehow a little bit unusual; it's hard to get a bead on exactly where these guys are coming from--which I like!Three out of five, with five being reserved for the *Sergeant Peppers* and *Dark Side of the Moon*s and *Moving Pictures* out there."
4,Know Your Onion! holds it together,"The Shins are one of my favorite groups ever since I saw the video for New Slang on Subpop many many months ago. Song by song they completely change and mold to fit anew.Caring is Creepy-A Garden State song. Very jangly and road trip worthy.One by One All Day-Spaced at first. Becomes a summer convertible song.Weird Divide-One of my other favorite songs off of Inverted. Very spaced and worthy of an Alexander Payne movie.Know Your Onion!-This is my favorite of all the songs. It's lyrics ring true to my life experiences.New Slang-Another Garden State song. The song that ""will change your life I promise you."" It really will, I swear.The Celibate Life-Drags on a little bit. Good writing though.Girl On The Wing-Not a big fan of this one.Your Algebra-2 minutes and 23 seconds of short lyrics.Pressed in a Book-To me this song deserves to be dissected by scientists to find all of the different meanings. There are so many.The Past and Pending-Great way to end it."
4,They hit gold with the Garden State soundtrack,"I love The Shins now. Have I always? No. I heard great things about them surrounding the release of Garden State, and with mild trepidation, decided to try out some of their music. I was very impressed and bought this album....and then later on I purchased Chutes Too Narrow.Both are great albums, but O.I.W, is such an easy listen, with no songs I skip over. They're all feel good songs (aside from the rather ominous, Your Algebra), and I can assure you, you will feel good after listening to them."
5,Who cares about Production?,"With regard to the person who gave this CD 2 stars, I'm sick of musicians and engineer wannabe's who review CD's. Music that grabs you does so in a visceral and not a technical way. The Shins aren't stupid. The production is fine (for those of us who aren't experts). If you want to get caught up in the subtlety of the drum levels go and conduct an orchestra.This is a brilliant release. The beautiful melodies are so plentiful that you wonder if they have anything left for next time. If Mercer were to only hum through these songs I would still enjoy them to no end. His lyrics though are the topper. Often when lyrics cannot be interpreted easily, it's attributable to pretentious writing. That is no where near the case here. Very poetic and they fit brilliantly into changing melodies within almost every song.My favorite release in 2 or 3 years."
4,Tracks 1-6,"It's too bad that listening to tracks 1 through 6 isn't an option here at Amazon, because those songs are truly the window to this album. Especially, ""Know Your Onion"" and ""Girl Inform Me."" However, the idea is still there within the other tracks: a grand album of understatement and nervous energy."
4,Worth your time,"The first time through I heard the Beach Boys, Marcy Playground, Yes, Clientele, and maybe some John Lennon. I've listened to this CD more than other disc this year. Of course it's derivative -- that's half the fun.It's always a true pleasure to take a chance on a disc and be rewarded many times over.It's the album I wish I had written."
4,GREAT INDIE INDEED!,"Nice set of songs that could very well belong to Brian Wilson (if he did a Pavement record)All thru the CD, the songs are strong with emotional, yet catchy lyrics and a jones for the spooky at times.One of my top 10 of 2001."
2,"Pleasant, derivative fun","(Actually **1/2, but Amazon doesn't allow half stars.)This is pleasant, melodic and fairly intelligent indie pop rock that does nothing that hasn't been before but does it rather well. Standout track ""Know Your Onion!"" is a catchy, jaunty ditty about adolescent alienation and includes a lyric about finding one's favorite record ""lying in wait at the Birmingham mall."" Since these guys are American, from New Mexico, that's a little silly, and it's even more so to reflect that the slowly strummed and murmured ""Weird Divide"" could just as easily have been titled ""We Like Syd Barrett."" This is pretty good pop though, offering annoying and endearing prettiness in about equal measure.Song by song:1 Caring Is Creepy ***2 One by One All Day **3 Weird Divide ***4 Know Your Onion! ***5 Girl Inform Me **6 New Slang **7 The Celibate Life ***8 Girl on the Wing ***9 Your Algebra **10 Pressed in a Book **11 The Past and Pending *"
3,An amazing album!,"This album is excellent! I bought it on vinyl about a month ago and it hasn't come off the table yet! The sound is supurb! I don't know about the lyrics. Some might say they are very charming and rythmical, maybe even ingenious. I found them a little to...how do I say...they were a little to unclear. We all know how poetry isn't supposed to be as straightforward as directions are. But some of this stuff just doesn't make a point or even a clear image of what its writer is drawing/writing about. But, as Kurdt Cobain said- music comes first, then the lyrics. And this album is supurb instrumentally. Maybe in the future the band will want to diliver a more concise and understandable message in their words. Take Care, C"
2,Dull,"Nicely written but not that exciting. I've noticed that people use the word ""derivative"" for otherwise competent albums which mirror bands they don't care for much, so I'd say this is derivative. If you like mellow music with a distinct late 60s influence then knock yourself out."
2,"oh, deep blue lukewarm vinyl","Purchase this on vinyl, and you just might get the coolest looking blue colored album you've ever seen. Surpises like this remind me why it's cool to buy vinyl. The production is another cool surpise of this album with lots of sonic variety and an obvious late 60's lo-fi pop aesthetic. The music is very listenable and The Shins point to greatness throughout this record (especially with ""The Great Divide""). The only thing that stops this album from being great is ultimately the lyrics. They are trying to be clever, but it comes across as pretentious, especially with such forgettable words like ""quotient"", ""celibate"", and ""condescending"". Yes, this is a lukewarm review, but so is the album."
3,"Pretty good, could be better",album can soar at the heights of excellence at times but it can then plummit down to the depths and produce lyric after lyric of complete rubbish. All in all a good album to listen to in the car especially tracks 4 and 5 but tracks like 2 and 7 can let it down.
4,"Oh, Inverted World Review","The first time I heard the Shins, I thought they sounded like modern-day Beatles. Oh, Inverted World does not disappoint. The entire album is good, not just one song that gets played on the radio too much. Good vocals, harmony, and great guitar.I would have given five stars, but the CD is only about 45 minutes long."
2,Bland,"As somebody else wrote, this has been done a lot of times before. It is extremely derivative 60's influenced guitar pop that is not that great but also not that bad. Actually quite faceless and bland."
4,hippy psychedelic music or something,"this is a fairly good cd, I think the shins are coming along here. some of the songs are very filler, but thats ok because they all sound ok, and theirs a few really good ones so it works....some of this kind of remdinds me of pink floyd, I dont know that may just be me.....this album would be incredibly awsome if you were high, like I said its hippy psychedelic music....."
2,Should have stopped at the first part.,"I had a feeling when I learned that Julia Glass won a prize for ""Best Novella"" for the first part of the book (""Collies"") that all of the good stuff would end there. The first part of THREE JUNES is excellent, but the rest of the book is so tiresome that it is hard to believe it was written by the same person. The author should have left ""Collies"" as it was - a beatifully written, somewhat heartbreaking account of the family. The rest of the book is quite uninteresting, and frankly, quite boring. I found myself in the middle of the book saying, ""I don't care about this Fenno dude, nor his AIDS-stricken friend."" For such a powerful topic, the book could have been much more moving."
2,"BOOKCLUB SELECTION, NOT MINE","WHILE THE WRITING ITSELF WAS WELL DONE, THE STORY WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING. THERE WAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL FOR ENLARGING THE FIRST CHARACTERS. MOM AND DAD. MAYBE THERE IS A SEQUEL COMING, BUT THE AUTHOR REALLY LEFT YOU HANGING. THEN WHEN THE SPEAKER ALL OF A SUDDEN BECAME A WOMEN ( AND WHO SEEMED TO ME A SUPERFULOUS CHARACTER) IT READ LIKE A DIFFERENT AUTHOR. THE STORY JUST DID.N'T GO ANYWHERE. MAYBE THAT WAS THE AUTHOR'S MESSAGE. LIFE REALLY DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE, IT JUST IS."
3,Recommended by a friend and just OK,"Quick read, just not what I expected.Nice story line if you enjoy that in your book choices.Quick transfer."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"I was not as captivated by the first chapters as many have been, but it kept me reading. And as the family dynamics emerged, and particularly when the focus shifted to Fenno in New York, I realized that I was hooked. He's a complex and likable character -- quite unconventional, in fact, in a contemporary novel, as he is not drawn to navel-gazing and sees himself more often as ridiculous than tragic. (We could all learn something here.)"
2,What am I missing?,"Is it me?? This is an award winner and recommended by a few friends, but to me it's slow-paced, unfocused and unengaging; the characters are bland and the story uninspiring. I'm 200 pages in and not sure what the point is. The NY Times reviewer calls it a plot-driven novel, but to me it's nearly absent a plot, and the characters aren't interesting enough to carry it. I tried it once and put it down, am plodding through it now for my book group. Otherwise I'd have given up."
5,An outstanding debut,"Julia Glass has woven a fine mesh of rich characters, intricate plot and intimate details into a story that I hated to put down. One of the critics I read indicated that they wished there were ""Four Junes"" so that this novel wouldn't have to end quite yet. I heartily agree. At first the three stories seem separate from one another, but as you get pulled into the fine intricacies of these peoples' lives, you realize that they are all intertwined, and in such fascinating ways. I adore these sorts of stories, and Ms. Glass has done this one to perfection."
2,Am I missing something?,"I generally try to read award-winning books as a way to avoid bad or uninteresting books. This was a mildly interesting story involving largely one-dimensional characters who whine a lot about their lives, their parents, their siblings. I found the author's persistent use of parentheticals tedious. I may be missing something, but I would not place this book in the same category with Cold Mountain, another National Book Award winner that is far superior to Three Junes. The best I could say about Three Junes is that it is good for a first novel."
3,Simply Forgettable,"Yes, the author can write but can she be imaginative and take us on a journey? I enjoyed the second part of the book the most about Fenno an interesting character. The 1st was OK, the 3rd part; I'm not sure why she even bothered to write this part! I'm getting tired of reading books about people's every day lives, nothing spectacular. I have an every day life of my own thanks. When I read a book I want rich characters, entertaining plots, perhaps a few twists & the use of a strong imagination on the part of the writer. Although the book is not horrible it's nothing to write home about and it's not a book you'll ever tell someone, or ever hear someone tell you: ""You gotta'read"""
1,I gave it one star because I couldn't give it less,"Characters were so one dimensional. If someone was ""good"" they were so good they seemed afflicted. The ""bad"" people were all exactly the same. The only character that I liked was the parrot. Has Ms Glass never heard that we readers hate, hate, hate when a new character is introduced in the last chapter?The lady who picked this for book club ended up quiting, she felt we were narrow minded and homophobic. Out of twelve of us only a couple thought it was okay.If you have trouble sleeping this is the book for you, it will put you right out...like a light."
2,Three Reasons Not to Read,"Number One: the Scottish sections read almost like a parody of a Scot's sentiments. Glass' ""Scottish"" voice is lacking authenticity.Number Two: the appliqué method, where three stories are told in succession, does little to elucidate the motivations of the characters. Glass gives the impression that she is retelling the same story, but with little depth as we read.Number Three: the novel is marred by cliché, a kind of PC enrichment of sentiment, which appears to mask for a lack of authorial skill. When a writer can't pull something off, it is easy to hide behind well worn cultural solipsism to generate sympathy and support."
4,what junes!,Reading this book was like watching a foreign film: Did I really read/see that? Was this worthy of Nat'l Book Award? I'm still trying to answer that question. Would I recommend this? Yes!!
2,Disappointing,"We read this book for our book club and we were all disappointed. It wasn't anything like what we were expecting from the description on the back of the book. The lady who picked it was afraid we would be offended by it, luckily we weren't. It was just hard to get into until almost two thirds of the way through, then when I finished I was very disappointed because some of the issues she bought up weren't resolved very well."
2,Flashbacks!,"I purchased this book after reading a sample so I should have gotten something I would enjoy. Unfortunately, it wasn't til I got the full version that the shifting back and forth in time and then back and forth in generations started. I suffered through a third of this book and then gave up. Too hard to follow and not enough in the story to put up with the changing back and forth for me to want to continue. It is now in archive and incompletely read."
3,Just okay,"I was disappointed with the novel, based on the fact it was a National Book Award winner. Perhaps it was too ""literary"" for me, but I found myself not really caring about the characters. Although I'm far from a prude, I felt the parts about the gay character was way more than I needed/wanted to know.I have purchased Glass's new one and hope I'll enjoy it more."
1,Someone tell me how to finish this book!,"I just can't get through this book. I have dragged myself through 100 pages and I am starting to feel my life is wasting away. I don't care about the characters because I don't know a thing about how they feel. The entire book is either a monotonous recounting of events or dialogue between extremely flat characters. Save yourself $12 and buy a book that is well-written and relatable...may I suggest ""Crow Lake"" by Mary Lawson, ""The Red Tent"" by Anita Diamant or ""Raising Fences"" by Michael Datcher. There you go, something for everyone and a 100 times better than Three Junes."
5,Lovely,"Three Junes is a lovely read, one that begins strongly and only gets better. The story concerns a Scottish family and begins in June 1989. Paul McLeod, recently widowed, takes a tour to Greece, contemplating his future, his past, his family. Jump ahead six years and we are in Scotland, where Paul's three sons are preparing for his funeral. Jump again four years, to Eastern Long Island, a weekend get together with two of Paul's sons and Fern, a woman Paul met on his trip to Greece. It is hard to do justice to this novel in a few pithy sentences. The writing is beautiful and Glass gives us characters we can care about deeply. Their lives are complicated, but without any melodrama or pyrotechnics. Her writing is simply beautiful and I believe gets stronger as the novel progresses. I thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful novel and highly recommend it. Enjoy."
4,Wonderful story...,"I just finished this book this morning and felt compelled to write a quck review. For some reason, it took me a little bit to ""get into"" this one but once I did, I could not put it down. It is very well-written and I am sad that it is over. I really enjoyed the characters, especially Fenno and even Fern, and it left me hungry for more...I want to know what happened when Fern told Stavros about the baby...I want to know if she ever realizes that she met Fenno's Dad on her trip to Greece...I want to know about Fenno's relationship with the twins. But despite my longing for more of this story, I am happy to have had the oprtunity to ""know"" these characters and I can highly reccommend this book."
4,Elegant writing,"Three Junes is this year's National Book Award winner for good reason. Julia Glass has that rare gift for gracefully interweaving the lives of her characters and effortlessly bouncing back and forth between different places and periods in time. She also draws her characters full of life, emotion, and humanity. This novel is an excellent portrait of the modern family. Each member leads his own life in its own unique direction, and yet what they have in common ultimately proves stronger than their differences or the distance that separates them. Fenno is one of the most charming characters I've come across in modern literature recently. Funny and kind, insecure and self-deprecating, sensitive and compassionate, he is loveable for both his strengths and his flaws. This is excellent writing."
5,Simply a Work of Art,"I had the rather strange experience of reading this book AFTER Glass's newest offering (""The Whole World Over""), and so was delighted to see some characters, notably the ultra complicated tortured soul Fenno, again.Because I knew that Fenno, who is the epitome of a dour Scotsman in Three Junes, had mellowed, I had more patience with him than maybe I would have had. I never really liked him in this book, but was that the point? This brilliant collection of interwoven vignettes had me spellbound throughout. I loved the tapesty of the written word. I loved the visual pictures the words evoked. I loved moving from Greece to Scotland to New York and back again through different sets of time.In short, I loved everything about this book, and I am so glad I discovered Julia Glass, to to me, if a quintessential writer."
2,I missed it,"Whatever the draw for this book was, I missed it. I know it got awards and great reviews, but I couldn't find the wonderful. I had to start it twice to try to ""get it"" but, I never did."
3,Interesting...,"A good solid read - but not the best. I found several of the characters to be annoying, at best. But, I was still interested until the end."
2,Three Junes -Where did They Get That Name?,"Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that ""Three Junes"" was listed as a popular book choice. The title sounded interesting so I bought it. That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition. It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline. I will finish the book because that's my style. It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to."
1,"National Book Award, what were they thinking?","I just didn't care about any of these characters and found many of them to be literary cliches (especially Fenno and Mal). A previous reviewer compared Three Junes to something Maeve Binchy might write. True, but she would've done a better job."
1,terrible,"This book is so ""flat"". It lacks characterization. I should have put it down after she drowned the puppy. The first 2 sections are centered around funerals with flashbacks that do not offer any insight. I am not sure if I will get through the third section. This book sounds like it was written by a high school English student. It lacks depth. It is such a disappointment. Perhaps if it had a better description on the book I wouldn't have bought it. I feel I was mislead into this purchase."
3,duldrom,"I found the characters and the story to be less than engaging. I was unable to grasp what the author was trying to communicate. It was very difficult to finish the novel because it simply did not hold my interest. The characters are not at all well developed and the story, itself was dated. I expected more from Julia Glass. Her novels are generally much better."
2,Ick!,Not for me. This book got very low ratings in our book club. Glass has an agenda that I don't agree with. A very liberal view of life. Would not recommend.
2,Over-hyped,"After reading all the glowing reviews on this book, I couldn't believe how bad it was. There are loose strings all over the place. The novel seems to be 3 short stories put together, but with no resolution on any of the significant issues that could tie everything together. The best characters are not well developed, although there are hints that these characters could have made up a compelling story. The main character, who is well drawn, is completely uninteresting with unclear motives.There is no denying that some of the writing is exceptional. But a novel commands that there be a plot and that it has characters that the reader will care about. Neither happened in my case. I only finished the book, because I kept hoping that something would happen and because I am reading the book for a book club. Fluff isn't enough.I would recommend this book to no one."
2,Three Junes,"I admire the author's beautiful writing, especially the opening of the book, when Paul joins a group tour of the Greek Islands. From the second part on, I found the story difficult to follow. Fenno's switch-back-and-forth narration lost me a few times and I almost gave up. But I forced myself to stay on to the end. Not that I enjoyed the suffering, but I was curious--I wanted to be convinced. For a book to win the National Book Award, there must be a reason. I was disappointed."
3,One June more appropriate,"Three Junes might resonate well with those who enjoyed The Hours. Like The Hours, Three Junes is divided into multiple story lines and times, which ultimately all connect. Unfortunately the weight of extraneous characters deterred from the few well developed and multi-dimensional characters, such as Fenno and Mal. Ms. Glass's novel would benefit from some editing, even cutting it down to a novella focussing on Fenno and his life post-Scotland. I admired the attempt at creating a rich theme of motherhood, but it was underdeveloped and non-contributitive, better suited to a separate story."
3,read part one ... then put it down,Part Two is long with tiring flashbacks back in time. The story drags and I longed to see some warmth in the characters. The cold and selfish characters did not capture my attention. Some clever and witty writing kept me reading but it was slow going.
2,Kind of a downbeat Maeve Binchey.,"Very ok. I just don't understand what all the hoopla is about.The story was just interesting enough to keep me reading, but barely. None of the charactars were well developed or likeable enough to make me care what happened to them. The Fenno charactar was ok, but the story really didn't let you get into his head. Just when you were starting to get interested, the book would switch directions. This book was recommended to me by several people, but obviously they don't read many books."
2,Disappointing,I have a friend who liked this novel so when it won the National Book Award I thought it would be one I'd like to read. How it won the award is beyond me. I didn't even finish it because the third story with the young girl( I don't even remember her name) wasn't compelling. I didn't find the writing as good as many other reviewers did. And much that happened seemed improbable. With so many great novels being written I hope we can award the very best.
3,"good start, questionable ending","At first, I was drawn into Ms Glass's luscious narrative and couldn't wait to get back to it. By the middle of the book I became irritated with Fenno's negative narration. Mal was unrelentingly angry. I was relieved when that section ended, then the third narrative about Fern didn't round out the book in a satisfying way. Why the hell doesn't Lillian ask Dennis for his sperm-did I miss something? Dennis seems much more obliging and besides, he's her husband's twin. Why wasn't the connection illucidated between Fern and Paul? You don't have to be obvious and heavy handed, but obtuse seems worse."
