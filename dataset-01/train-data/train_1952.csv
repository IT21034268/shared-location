1,it is grippy,"it is grippy and that is nice however the stock is TOO short and TOO narrow, it's like having the end of a broom handle jabbed into your shoulder over and over. **** this!"
5,Two great novels in one book!,"Another Fine Myth is the first book in what became one of the best fantasy series EVER! Not only is it full of magic, monsters and mayhem but it also has lots of humor. Sheeve was a apprentice, until his teacher dies and leaves him with a powerless demon named Aahz, a couple of assassins and a evil magician who wishes to rule ALL the dimensions.Few people can mix humor and fantasy such as Robert Asprin. And this book is not just the first novel, but also holds the follow-up, Myth Conceptions. In the second book Sheeve go to the court to try to become the Court Magician of Rodrick the Fifth. The amazing part is he gets the job with Aahz's help. But he finds, to his horror, that his first assignment is to stop the largest army the world has ever seen. All by himself.The only other author I can think of, off the top of my head, who can pull off this mixture of humor and serious fantasy is Steven Brust."
4,"Silly. Ridiculous, even. Pretty good read","These are silly books. If you want there to be a point, then you are in the wrong place.These myths are quite funny, and extremely pun-y. If you can enjoy a good pun, a bit of zaniness (actually, make that three dashes of zaniness), and don't care whether the over-arching story is ever fully resolved, then you'll like these.Each story is self-contained, and yet there is an overarching... plot, if you will... that connects them. At times, it seems as though the overarching plot will never move forward. It does, but only slowly, and clearly not to any intended conclusion.Each individual plot, on the other hand, wraps itself up in a totally absurd manner in the individual volume.Oh, go on, buy them. You'll fly right through them, chuckling the whole way. Who cares if there's no point!I'll meet you at the bazaar. I've been stuck here for so long that I don't remember where I came from. But I've set up a tent. I tend dragons."
5,Don't be Myth Led,"I could repeat all of the previous comments, but that would be redundant. The main problem I have is that it's a PAPERBACK. If you're going to get this trust me YOU WILL NEED A HARDCOVER. I guarantee you'll find yourself over indulging in these stories long after you've finished the book. Spend the extra money and get a copy that will last. That said I suppose someone should plead the case for an Omnibus or Collectors Edition in hardback to the publisher so start writing."
5,They Do Have Some Thrash Beats,"Majesty is an awesome song to start the album,then the fast and very powerful Guardian Of The Blind(amazing)the best song!Trial By The Archon is an instrumental that jumps right into Wizard's Crown which will blow you away.Run For The Night is on this album which of course you can hear the live version onTales From The Twilight World.The Martyr rules,Battalions Of Fear isn't that good of a song,By The Gates Of Moria is an instrumental and Gandalf's Rebirth is also an instrumental,this album has three instrumental's.This is a well thought out album,the lyrics,riffs,solo's,bass,drums and of course Hansi's amazing voice is all awesome.They have thrash beats in them but there not thrash.Buy it you will like it,this is there first album and there best."
2,Eh.,"The writer seems too concerned with his own vocabulary, rather than giving each of his characters a unique voice. Not that the diction is meant to be over your head, but even the young children speak in an awkward, florid manner. I guess that intended to be humorous, but it mostly just got on my nerves. I also agree that the silly names were annoying, and I'm a big fan of silly names. Why is the Kenyan named Bobolink Crustacean in this dramatic book? That isn't even vaguely Kenyan-sounding.There were also parts of the book that were beyond ridiculous. I'm not even referring to Kevin's running (the best parts of the book related to running, or at least that is my biased opinion). The way that the school administrators acted was beyond childish, and it was impossible to suspend your disbelief for such whimsical occurrences.It is an interesting story, and I like the way that Kevin progresses as a character. But there are too many flaws in everything else."
4,Well Done,"This is a well written novel in which the protagonist is an exceptionally gifted high school runner. I thought the passages that had to do with training and racing were excellent. I also thought the author did a great job of caturing the adolescent psyche. The story elements which involved the ""bad guys"" (the prncipal ., the doctor, the college coach) struck me as being contrived and took away from the story."
4,Runner's world,"I really did like this book! I ran High School track and cross country and understand the bonds you form with the people on your team. And so I thought the author did a really good job placing those bonds and emotion into the story. The author can tell a good story and I enjoyed his very physical descriptions of the running life and felt that they were very real, believable, and inspiring. I also really felt for the main character (something every good book does), and liked the fact that he grows and learns from his pain. He is anything but a flat character, which is refreshing. I am convinced Jackson has run high school track and cross country, and if he hasn't he has been extremely close to the sport to the point where its in him as much as it would be otherwise.This is a great running book, though I'm not sure I would recommend that you buy it for your running kid because of some of the language."
5,Excellent guide to North California,Really good suggestions and help for a family that's just moved here. All the things we've tried from this book have been a success!
2,Missing Something Great,Missing Nick's Cove Restaurant in Marshall...one of the best restaurants in that area. Not sure how the author could have missed that one.
5,Think you know the stories of the old testament?,Many readers may be surprised and thrilled to see this wondrous collection of paintings which illustrate stories from the old testament in relation to contemporary events. The artist's accompanying explanatory texts are fascinating to me.A book to be cherished for its thoughtful insights into the origins and history of religious beliefs.
1,Have to agree with Veronica Williams,"This DSL modem is a piece of junk. Not exactly sure what the problem with this thing is, but it has to be cold booted (unplug it, wait 15 seconds, plug it in again) every morning if I want to retain the through-put I'm paying for.If you own one of these things you can see for yourself how bad it is by running a speed test at the DSL Reports website before doing a cold boot and after doing a cold boot. In my case the download speed *DOUBLES* after a reboot."
5,Works Great,If your phone company has updated the lines from analog then this will work. I used it for five years very happily. But when we moved to central Utah we found that they have not updated the lines for dsl.
2,Could of been better.,This started out to be an entertaining Softcore romp. But veered off into tame Peach territory.
4,Great Spatula; Huge Glitch,"I read about these on Kevin Kelly's Cool Tools Site (kevinkelly.com) and I bought two for work. I work as a cook at a resort, and like them very much, but I had one break within a week. Moving a cream cheese mixture in a processor bowl, the spatula had been pushed down into the bowl, bending it's blade at a 90 degree angle. It broke at the top of the metal bar contained inside the handle.I emailed Chef'n explaining what happened, and they quickly argeed to replace it. So if you do break one, don't throw it away. If you buy one, you may want to shy away from ultra-thick mixtures, and bending it at severe angles. It's still a Five Star piece of equipment for gravies, sauces, omelets and the like, but not for everything."
3,I loved it! Until it broke...,"So sad,I've had this tool for about 5 months, and I've been in love with it since day one. I think I've convinced about 10 friends to buy one too. Yesterday though, I was using it to push some sugar around as I was melting it for a flan, and the spat just snapped right at the point where the steel support begins. I've called chefn and left a message about replacing it... but given similar comments on Amazon, let the buyer beware. Great tool, but not as sturdy as it seems*update*Chefn was more than happy to replace the spat for me when I sent it in (natch, to my expense for outgoing shipping, but free for the return shipping) to them. They didn't require a receipt either. I still like the spat a lot, but am weary to use it for more strenuous purposes."
2,enthusiasm faded after the thing broke,"Corrected review:On September 1st, after using it five times to stir soft ice cream, I used this spatula to stir flour into oil and it broke with the steel stem sticking out.Amazon emailed the promise to refund this product but I haven't seen the refund yet."
2,Why is this so highly rated?,"I bought this spatula based on all the positive reviews here. Later, I found that Cook's Illustrated gave this their *lowest* rating, putting it last among a large number of spatulas. Unfortunately, that's where it belongs.This is almost useless for actual cooking, although I guess it's ok if all you're doing is flipping a fried egg or something. The material is quite soft, meaning you can't scrape the sides of a bowl. Certainly if you're working with a stiff dough you won't get enough leverage. There's a piece of metal inside meant to give the Switchit some rigidity, but it doesn't extend far enough.The gimmick of having two ends to work with turns out not to be that useful--flip the spatula over and you've got whatever you were just stirring now running over your hand."
1,Not a good vendor,"Ordered this item. First package received did not contain my order, but rather that of another customer. Contacted vendor. Order was replaced. Received second package. Item was not the item that was ordered. Same manufacturer, but incorrect item. Avoid buying from MidAtlantic Merchant. Please note that the manufacturer - Chef'n was not responsible for this problem. I have several of their pieces and they are fine."
2,A little too stiff for my liking,"I like the concept of this easy-to-keep-clean kitchen gadget, but I found it to be too stiff for my liking. Perhaps if the tip was a bit longer it would be more flexible, but for now I'm sticking with my traditional spatulas."
4,very entertaining,This is a very good quality DVD. The dances are varied and entertaining. Most of the performers are top belly dancers but the tribal fusion dancers don't seem to match the level of the oriental dancers. The sound and image are excellent too. Overall very professionally made.
3,Damaged dvd case,"I thought I was getting this like new, but the case for the dvd had broken pieces. I was buying this as a gift so I was disappointed."
3,Good Item - Available at Costco for $139.00,"No major knocks on the product. Not really suitable for a professional, however it's a nice entry level machine for a novice/student/non-pro. I paid $40 extra for ""expedited shippping"", which ended up being ups 3-day select. At 15 lbs., I suspect somebody's making a profit on the shipping charges. I found this item in stock for $139 at Costco. If you add the shipping, I could've saved about $100 if I had driven 10 minutes to the local costco and simply purchased the unit. I typically don't mix buying experience issues with product reviews, but in this case I feel buyers out there should be aware of the reality that purchasing this unit through amazon is not a terrific choice."
2,disappointed,Bought these from a local music store couple days ago.The finish is solid and impressive but theyre too bouncy and i get double beats with every hit playing heels down.Changing the tension made little difference and as far as i can tell theres no way to change the pedal starting position.
1,terrible game!!,"this is the suckest game ever. dont buy this game. i got this game for present, i just played it once for 5 min and i never want to play it again. only 1 word to describe the game - terrible!!!!!"
5,An excellent depiction of this marvellous breed,"Breyer's National Show Horse is very pretty, and can help children learn about horses and their anatomy, as long as a knowledgeable adult can point out the model's physical points such as withers, hocks, hooves, etc. Believe me, though, if you get a child this model, they will definitely want more Breyer models!"
4,"Neat model, but REALLY fragile and hard to balance.","This model is nice, but she can't stand very well and her tail is really fragile. She is great for a collection, though! There is light gray shading on her muzzle and her hooves are shaded yellowish-pink. This models eyes are very pretty, they have a lot of character in them. My sister named this horse Silver Song, and I think that is a wonderful name for this model. I highly recomand it for OLDER, more RESPONSIBLE kids. This is a great model, folks!!!!!"
4,Details ok.,"The ring is cool, but the details could be a little better. You can see the line from the ring coming out of the mold. The ring wasn't cleaned up the way it should be. The metal isn't as clean looking between the spikes as it shows in the pictures (extra metal that should have been removed still exists)."
5,Love Corelle,"I have one warning when choosing to buy Corelle: Pick your pattern carefully, because they last forever! I've had the Rosemarie pattern for 15 years now and I still love it.I have had to replace exactly ONE piece (a platter) over that time...and that is saying a lot because I have 5 kids.I wash these in the dishwasher daily and I see no fading whatsoever."
2,Bass bumpin music!,"Uncle Luke is back, just in time for bass lover in you. 1 CD, 27 tracks, and the most bass riden, shaken music since AS NASTY AS THEY WANNA BE. Rapper Big Pun drops by on SLIPPERY WHEN WET. (I'll leave the title alone.) The best part of this Luke ""experience"", the liner notes, the which reads as a who's who in hip hop music. A pleasant surprise appears on track 10, BABY BE MINE, the Quad City DJ's let the groove flow as only they can. Don't say I didn't warn you, spare yourself from the bass remix of LOVIN' YOU track 14."
2,"You're Better Off Buying ""Wrestlemania 2000""","This game was very disappointing because the characters are so dull. They are so slow when they move, and they surprisingly seem even slower when they run! They show no emotion whatsoever when they perform their finishing moves. Also, I know this game was released in 1999, but the roster is out of date. It is even more worthless renting the game. The reason it gets TWO stars is because the graphics are decent, and I enjoyed the Create-A-Character feature."
2,"Attitude - Great Graphics, Poor Gameplay","Attitude was way over rated, they said it was suppost to be the Greatest Game ever, but that is certainly not true. Acclaim does not make very good wrestling games at all. This game gets a 2 for several reasons. (1) The crowd is not into it at all in this game, it is one of the most quiet games I have ever played (2)The move list way too short, and too complicated (3)This game is a CLONE of warzone, but just more types of matches to choose from (4) And finally the Attitude entrances could be a lot better, they dont even show there entrances all of the time. Well if I were you I wouldn't waste 60$$ on this game, but spend your 60$$$ on Wrestlemania 2000!"
4,this game is good but kind of old school.,"this game is good because it has undertaker,kane,mankind,the rock,stonecoldsteveaustin.on this game there is no smackdown stage. because smackdown made its debut at the same time as this game did.and i am not complaing because i do have cable and do watch raw on spike tv."
3,"Not horrible, but not what I expected","After all the critics hyped this game up so much, I began to get very excited. Then when I finally played it, my first thoughts were: ""This is NO different from any of the other wrestling games. It's almost identical to WWF: War Zone. The wrestlers don't have as many moves available (About 10 for each wrestler). Also, the Create A Player mode is almost so complicated, it becomes no fun. I really suggest waiting until WWF Wrestlemania 2000 comes out."
2,What a dissapointment!,I've got 4 words for ya'- DONT BUY THIS GAME! I was waiting 7 months for this game and I played it for a week. huge dissapointment. The Create a player is the ONLY good thing about the game. Bye
2,Where do I start,"O.K. before you start biting my head off hear me out. Weapons matches- way too slow and repetitve Cage- SNORE All other kinds of matches- Repetive The N64 version has so many bugs like you cant change costumes, Tripple H dosent talk no matter what Language setting its on. youd think with a 3 month delay they could have fixed it. this game did poor SHORT MOVE LISTS, TO SLOW, NOT AS MANY COOL THING AS WCW/NWO WORLD TOUR LIKE PUNCHING YOUR OPPONENT OVER THE ROPES.....SUGGESTON SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SMACKDOWN OR WM2K"
2,Book excellent; Kindle Edition YUCK!,If you need this book to use for a lit study don't get this edition. There are no page numbers. It is impossible to find what you need. A huge waste of money and a major frustration!
5,"Charming,enchanting,exciting,basically wonderful book!","Anne of Green Gables captures your heart as you meet her through this wonderful book. Anne is an orphan looking for a real home. Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert send in an adoption request for a boy, but the only child standing at the train stop when they are supposed to pick him up is a girl, Anne. Anne is frightened of having to go back to the orphanage when she finds out that Marilla really wanted a boy. Anne acts like a perfect lady to win Marilla and Matthew's love for her. You will absolutly love Anne of Green Gables if you like incredible, real-life books that you can't put down!"
2,"wonderful story, not so great annotations","I'm not concerning myself with the story of Anne, which is a classic and rightly so, but the annotations are often times not enlightening or of any interest or are even bizarre and often give away parts of the story, which is utterly annoying. The additional information in the back about PEI, life at the time and more are interesting, but again more than once they give away key elements of later books in the Anne story.If you know the story of Anne already, this might be an intersting second read, otherwise I recommend to stay away from the annotations so as not to spoil the wonderful story."
5,A Magnificent Book,"The introduction and textual notes provide insight into Anne's world. They also give a feel for how well read L.M. Montgomery was. The story is treated respectfuly, and for those who love Anne, one reading will not be enough"
5,GREAT book.,"If you want or need to know more about Anne or LMM, it's just THE book. It's absolutely great, very informative and totally worth the money."
1,roll of the dice,You would get more accurate results rolling dice. Unless my total has dropped by 100 points since my last lab test... the next model is going to skip the blood and have you pick a number between 1 and 100.
1,Agree with other reviewers,I agree with the other reviewers. This device does not give you an accurate measurement of either total cholesterol or HDL - the company's other kit. The numbers appear to be low by about a third.
1,Does not work,"I've bought many of these over the years, and they usually gave results much lower than the lab work from 3 different labs. I filled out the forms for the FDA to report this kind of bad product, but they only responded by giving me contact information for the manufacturer. The manufacturer declared the kits were properly tested and calibrated. I asked for the documentation from the labs to prove it and they refused to release the information. No refund was offered. FDA did not follow through with any action."
4,ok,"The result from chol. kit 228. The result from clinic lab 256. It was about 30 points off. it is ok for a range, but not 100% accurate"
3,Work but hard to install,These were cheap and they work great buy they were really hard to install. Only if you have installed a car stereo or alarm should you venture into installing these. Other than that they are pretty nice addtion to my truck.
5,Awesome buy,Awesome sound! Better than some much higher priced ones I tried. I will buy these again. Do da do da
5,AMAZING,THESE speakers are really good. i love these speakers. they hit good and sound good. i will never switch out theses speakers !!!
1,"Soundstream 6.5"" and 5.25"" Tarantula Speakers","There isn't much reason to go into a long review. In a word, they suck. I installed the Soundstream Tarantula 6.5"" and 5.25"" speakers in my 2002 4-Runner over the weekend. (I have an Alpine head unit & amp.) They sound worse than my factory paper cones. The highs are tinty and harsh and the lows are vague and muddy. Simply awful. I used Soundstream years ago in an old '92 4-Runner and they were wonderful. I'm guessing they weren't made in China back then. I noticed the ""MADE IN CHINA"" sticker on the box as I was installing them. I'm going to order some MB Quarts and throw the Soundstreams in the trash."
2,Not Worth It,"I thought Friskars would be a good choice since I love their scissors, but... this sharpener is difficult for young hands to manage well. Having to squeeze the contraption to the open position and twist a pencil to sharpen it at the same time is too much for early writers (under 8, I'd say). Also, it seems to repeatedly break the tips of pencils - worse than others I've used. Not worth the $8 - $10. Buy a couple of plain old metal sharpeners instead."
2,Does not work for crayons,"I bought this specifically to use for crayons, but our small crayons don't fit in the small hole and our big crayons don't fit in the big hole. I can sharpen the small crayons in the big hole though, so it is not a total loss. I can't comment on how it works on pencil sharpeners as I only used it for crayons."
2,2 stars based on failure to sharpen crayons,"I am an adult and have used crayons all my life.I bought this Fiskars item locally and will be returning it for a full refund. This item will not sharpen Crayola crayons to as good a point as the hand-held sharpeners I used when I was a kid.I (and probably most children) can get a sharper point on a crayon by rubbing it on each side on scrap paper than I can get with this ""sharpener.""If you have a crayon whose tip is completely flat, then I suppose you could call what this item does ""sharpening.""I'm glad the largest drugstore chain in the U.S. gives full refunds and is in my neighborhood."
2,cute but breaks pencils,"Ok, this is a cheap little sharpener, but after you sharpen a pencil, the tip frequently breaks off (i.e., shortly after you start trying to write with it). Come on."
2,Makes a mess,"This sharpener makes a nice sharpened pencil, but the end which contains the shavings keeps fallling off and making a mess. I have bought my son a different sharpener for school."
4,"Great for meditation, yoga and general relaxation....","Once again David Darling has produced a work of extraordinary quality. This CD is wonderful for use while meditating, getting a massage and yoga. Anyone who wants to relax and refresh would enjoy listening. I especially enjoyed the flute portions which were full and rich and very heart opening."
2,Not at all what I expected,"After all the glowing reviews, I was very dissapointed with this CD which I intended to use for massage therapy. The music is very discordant (is that the right word?) and does not leave me feeling relaxed, just bored and irritated. Maybe this music is just the kind that doesn't resonate well with my brain waves, but I found it extremely poor."
2,great comedy&#65533; poor value&#65533;,"The other reviews are absolutely correct; the Kids in the Hall are astounding. This video, however, contains only two episodes and as such, is of questionable value. If you are a diehard fan and feel you MUST own KIDH merchandise I can certainly recommend this video - otherwise, I discourage the purchase of this video."
5,Good to read and have fun,"This book is very funny and good. Very easy to ready! It's like watching a movie but seems like real life at the same time. I recommend it highly to people who like the movie Pulp Fiction, Crash, four brothers, this book for you"
2,Save your drill,"I attached my heavy duty drill to this thing and turned one small chess piece and my drill burnt up. Not so sure I want to try repeating the experience. Otherwise, it works very well."
3,Not a very good person to buy from,"The book is in OK shape. It was mailed 7 days after it was gauranteed to be shipped, seller never responded to emails. Would not recommend this seller if you are looking for prompt service. I was dissatisfied."
3,Aerator Lite,"After the first use (on a rain-soaked yard, as recommended), I'm a little disappointed. Placing a solid flat cinderblock on the platform, I was unable to PUSH the aerator without the teeth digging in and stopping forward movement altogether. So I had to PULL it instead. If not for the fact that I have a small yard (20' x 40'), this would have taken forever. It seems to ""aerate"" but compared to the ""plug-style"" machines, this is a poor substitute. (On the other hand, what would you expect for $40?)"
1,Use a Nail Instead,"I bought this with some hope that it would break the matting on turf grass, I wasn't even looking for aeration. This product is useless for either endeavor. A cinder block lacked the weight to punch through the grass. I modified the unit by welding two rods to the plate so I could attach weights. Started with 30lbs and still didn't work. At 60 lbs the unit worked but you could imagine pulling that weight around. This thing has a few design problems - if you pull it, you are lifting its weight off of the ground. If you push it, you might as well use no weight at all, your body acts as the weight. You will be guaranteed some exercise with that approach. Oh, I even tried sharpening the blades with a grinder. If you crawl on your hands and knees and use a hammer and nail, the results would be better."
1,crummy product,"product is poorly designed (made in china), and is mislabeled because there's no way the one of the product pictures depicting a 120lbs female pushing the aerator like a self-propelled mower could work. if you can bench 300lbs and squat 500, then ""pushing"" the aerator is about the same as hand-plowing--without the ox. Plastic between spikes breaks immediately, the sides plow into the turf, and the handles are impossibly made for pushing unless you want to break your wrist every 3 seconds that the thing gets stuck.Also mislabled because concrete blocks are neither heavy enough nor stay on without 40 bungee cords--being solid, they also bounce around too much. The only weights that somewhat work are bags of lead shot (heavy enough, don't bounce around) or sand bags.Pushing is too hard, pulling doesn't spike deep enough.whoever designed this ought to go back and finish elementary school."
2,Poor workmanship,"This piece needs weight,a cement block is what I used.It KINDA works, but if I was going to buy it now. I would think twice before I did it. I should have known it was to cheap, and poor craftmanship. If your taller than 5 ft, Don't get it, or find away to expand the handle higher.If you want to take a week or so to try and get any denifite from this, Have fun, it's at lest getting you one heck of a work out, if nothing else."
1,Spike Aerator,This product will not work in clay soil. Cement blocks don't fit thetray for them to set on. Would not recommend buying.
1,This is a total piece of crap,"When it arrived it had three broken plastic bushings that go inside the wheels to allow them to fit the shaft. Needless to say with three of these broken I had to do some rigging to get it to work.It is cheap, and others have complained of a regular cement block not fitting in the tray on top. But if you can go to home depot or lowes and get three patio pavers in the 9 x 6 inch category they will fit in the tray just fine.If you are a welder or work in metal, it's a cheap set of parts you can make into something you can use. Otherwise, just hire it done."
4,Great buy for the price,I had shoe aerators but they broke quickly so I went with this one. This is good unless you have hard and soft spots in your yard. I do so I was having to remove and add weight (landscaping bricks) at different areas of the lawn but overall it works great if you aren't lazy.
1,Things Are Not as They Appear,"This items was difficult to assemble. Once assembled the spikes, which appear to be sharp in the photo were basically blunt spears. Placing a house brick on the carriage to give extra weight on the ""spikes"" proved unsuccessful. The so called spikes are only 1 1/2 inches long. Unless you have very short grass and supper soft soil, this aerator does not work. It's only place is in the trash bin! A waste of my money."
3,More effective than the shoes,"I have 1/3 of an acre and was able to aerate in a little over an hour going non-stop, so it is more time efficient that the shoes, but it is a little small still. The item was shipped without the cotter keys that go in each end of the spike shaft and when they say some assembly required, trust me they are not kidding. The handle needs to be longer unless you are 5 foot tall it is going to kill your back and shoulders. The manufacture could write it down somewhere what size block is recommended and probably consider a different spike design, but this item is worth the price Amazon has on it. Small yard, not many hills, and you are less than 6 foot tall; I would recommend purchasing this item."
1,not a good product.,The product is not study or capable of performing the task it is suppose to do. I do not recommend this product to anyone.
3,Not good on hard surface,"Easy to assemble, sharp, pointy blades. Doesn't fit your standard cinder block. Not made for compact soil."
3,A book like her singing,"I found this book a lot like Schwarzkopf's singing: Nice, but not exciting. I'm not sure that I learned much more about the singer or her singing from reading this book."
4,BEST PINBALL GAME ON GBA,"This game is the best GBA Pinball game so far. Now that the Gameboy Advance SP is out, you can totally see everything on the board. The graphics and gameplay is done superbly. Highly Recommended! Buy this game!!!"
3,The Pinball of the Dead,"Its okay at first, but gets boring after a few days, the grafx are great and sound is great but the creatures are a bit small on the already tiny screen. Overall.... its okay. worth about $8.99"
2,lost in the everglades,"Let me first say this is a very good film,my complaint is with the quality of the film/disc.The film can stand with any of the action/westerns out of the 50's .Gary Cooper as always is in great form and the supporting cast is good.The film though has a grainy look to it and the disc quality is fair to low.I guess for the price you can't be to picky. Some extras or behind the scenes look would be nice.A plus with the film is the locations that were used, a great look at the wilds of Florida."
4,Oldies,"Plenty of suspense and action and adventure a real classic.Gary Cooper plays his part well in this movie and the cast make it so real, Simole indians are a bad bunch and cooper must save the girl played by Mari Aldon who was captive to them."
3,why have to tell lie?,well i bought it at the mall store. it said it has closed captioned on it back then i started to on my dvd on tv and didn't apear at all just blank. you know that i am deaf guy i can't hear at all. you got that. huh just let me know here my e-mail address is cecilo57@webtv.net.
1,One of the worst films I've ever seen,"This is maybe the worst film I've ever seen. The indians are evil beasts who,among other horrible things, throw some soldiers into a basin with crocodiles in.Gary Cooper and his soldiers are innocent people who are just trying to defence themselves: Is that a realistic story?I was disappointed of Cooper, I'd never thought he would be starring in such a film.I'd never recommend that picture to anybody"
3,"To save for: fluent telling, environing, photography","""Distant drums"" has three characteristics so remarkable to do it as a mvie to save: firstly the telling of the story is very 'fluent'and pleasant for the equlibrium among events, personages and enviroment. The natural enviroment is very remarkable: the movie may be considered a document of Florida in 50's. The photography is extraordinary for clearness: the hope is the film kept that quality despite the long past time (the 'Technicolor' technology has been used for it)."
3,Been Done w/ spoiler,"The movie was pretty good but the story line was done better at least twice before.In Northwest Passage and Objective Burma. Special Operation Force goes out on a mission and successfully completes it with minimum or no casualties. Something happens to cause them to miss pick up forcing them to walk out. Commander is force to split unit. The part of the unit without star is captured, torture and executed by the enemy. The only difference in this movie is a leading lady giving the star a love interest."
5,Distant Drums movie,Great old Cooper movie. Similar to a western but takes place in the Florida everglades. Lots of action. My Dad was a big Gary Cooper fan and took me to see it when I was a kid. Remembered a lot about it after all these years and wanted a copy. A little dated but still better than most movies they make these days.
3,"The Hollywood version of history, but reasonably entertaining","Suspiciously similar to ""Northwest Passage"" (Spencer Tracy) - march through swamp (forest wilderness), attack on indian (French) stronghold, difficult retreat pursued by enemies . . .Don't expect accurate historical details in ""Distant Drums"", it's only the Hollywood version of the Seminole wars - with all that that implies. If you're not too particular, it's OK for a wet Sunday afternoon."
2,Weak Cooper,"DISTANT DRUMS is weak Gary Cooper, indeed. Another example of how Warner Bros. had no idea how to use Cooper during his six picture deal from the late forties to the early fifties. This is notable mostly for some terrific location work in the Everglades and a fine score from Max Steiner. One sidebar: This is one of several westerns in the fifties in which Cooper was a parent. No other star played a father as often as Cooper, especially in westerns."
3,Ehhh....,I guess I differ greatly from the comments I've seen on the ranger games for the SNES. I loved the first MMPR game that was realeased a bit more than the MMPR Movie game. First off I love combo attacks in games. The first had this where as the second only gave you one strike that you did over and over. The enemies were much weaker save for the boss battles which could be a bit challenging at times.I do like the fact that the Movie game provided a two player option that the first left out and the fact that you can morph once you gained enough lighting and not at a set place. Both games needed much improvement but I felt that this title was a step back from the first outside of the two player co op feature.
1,this game ...,This game ... real bad! The graphics ...! The players are just a blurr on the screen! The game is kind of fun the first few times you play it. I couln't believe how bad the sound was!This game is one of the worst gameboy games i have ever played!
1,NFL Blitz 2000,"This software is excellent for the PC platform. It is very good for the N64 platform. For the Color Gameboy platform, one should not even bother purchasing it. I thought I'd get somewhat similar graphics to Tarzan; this game has graphics similar to mid-80s games - it is a major disappointment. If I could return it, I'd do so in a second. This game has to be one of the worst-conceived games for the gameboy platform. If you want to buy NFL Blitz 2000 - buy it for the PC, don't bother to buy it for the gameboy"
1,"Bad graphics, bad game","Just like what I said above bad graphics bad game. Do not get this game the N64,DC,and PSX version is way better than this one. I read other peoples ones most of them are absoulutly right."
2,seems like it came out in the 70's!,this game is not at all good! go buy something else unless you like games completely out of whack!
1,DONT GET THIS GAME!,"YOU CANT SEE THE CHARCTERS! you also cant read the plays, you need a gameboy magnafier to do it! this game makes me so mad! The screen was all blurry and it was full of bugs! Lucky for me i took a hammer to this game..."
1,THE WORST,"I loved the arcade and the N64 version of this game, and was really excited when it came out...i was greatly let down. I can't see. I try to make out the different plays that you can call (which all seem the same) and then hike the ball. Then, the guys become all blurry and my linemen give me about two seconds of pretection and different colored blurrs drift tward my QB and i am sacked. I tryed running away, sacked, i tried passing, incomeplete EVERY TIME! It makes me so frusterated i turn it off. I have never even comepleted a game."
1,It just ain't fun like this,"Don't get me wrong, I love playing NFL Blitz, but the portable versions are just godawful. While the first GameBoy Color version of Blitz is fun at first, it quickly wears thin. First off, you can barely see the football, next the graphics are really, really blurry (especially when you play it on an old GameBoy in black & white), and sometimes the controls are unresponsive. Now, I'm not saying the NFL Blitz games are bad games (most of them anyway, the recent GBA game is horrible), but you should take any other version of a Blitz game; whether its on PS1, PS2, Dreamcast, N64, Gamecube, or XBox; over this any day."
2,Could Have Been Better,"The game is pretty fun , but you don't get to do all the fun things that are on the N64 game. The games are long and hard to win. They could have made it better."
2,"OK, not great though",This game could be better. When you recieve the football and you use turbo you almost always fumble it. Also when you tackle someone it looks like you just touched them. I thought the graphics would be better!!
2,Not What I Expected,"NFL Blitz for Game Boy is nothing special. The graphics are horrid, basically just a bunch of blurry things and the game play as just as bad. The season mode is nothing to brag about either, the games are to short and to easy to win. When I finished my season and won the Super Bowl, I was expecting something cool to happen, but all I got was a woman holding a trophy and the screen saying ""Congradulations"". I love the arcade game, but I wish they could have done a better job putting it on Game Boy. I hope NFL Blitz 2001 is better."
4,A good book for an introductory electronics lab course on junction transistors,"Although this is not the sort of book for someone studying to become a device physicist, it is the right kind of book for somebody taking an introductory electronics lab course that includes biasing of junction (i.e pnp or npn) transistors. The author begins with a simple discussion of the role of the pn junction in a diode and then builds on that concept to explain pnp and npn transistors. This book does not go on to explain transistors in terms of more sophisticated ideas in solid state physics and statistical mechanics such as band gaps, fermi levels, or chemical potentials. For that sort of more advanced treatment one should read Shockley's seminal treatment of the subject:Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors with applications to Transistor Electronics."
4,its pretty awsome!!!!!!!!,"alright lets begins racers revenge 101 im your teacher mr. me ok class let me tell you about this game it great i loved it it takes place 8 years after episodeI or if you prefer2 years befor episodeII you can play as a BUNCH of racers old and new(mostly old)including anikan skywalker,sebulba,dud bolt,odi mandrell,rats tyrell,colman trebor,mawhonic and a lot of others you for every race you play that you make it in 1st,2nd or 3rd you get winning accordingly to buy upgrades for your podracer.Fans of racing games and/or starwars should do thhemselves a favor a BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!that's all for now class!"
4,Looks pretty cool,Cons: It's a star wars game.Pros: It's made by the team that made the ATV Offroad Fury series.It's a 50-50. Look at the way you want to.
4,Quality game,"Options include single events, tournaments, and two-player mode. The tournament is where the hard hitting action is at. In tournament mode, your pod racer works his way through different race courses and earns money for pod upgrades (speed acceleration, cooling, defense, repair, etc.) along the way. The first 2 or 3 tournaments may seem to lack a serious challenge, but that all changes around the 4th or 5th round. It doesn't take much to go from 1st to last by hitting a wall. I've won races by as little as .1 seconds with the top 5 pods all coming within a few seconds of each other. I've also taken a wide turn while in 1st and finished 3rd. The game description says that speeds reach up to 600mph, but I have gone in excess of 700mph. Quality game with excellent graphics and game controlls. Would have given 5 stars, but the 2 player mode just wasn't meant to be... not enough room on the screen to accommodate it."
5,Racers Revenge,"This game was great it had great graphics, Great racers, good controls 4.3 sound and cool pods. There is secret racers Darth Maul, Darth Vader, Watto, Sebulba episode 1, anikin episode 1and a few others. The only bad thing is it is to short. I recommend just renting it unless you don't play much video games or are not good."
5,Well Improved,"Although the game is a little short, it is very good. I like the way you can kill off other racers for the rest of the race, and get more money for it. But, if you are KO'd, the race is over. The pods are much faster, even though the spedometer says you are going about half the speed of the other game."
3,True racer speaking here,"over all the game is ok, but it is missing something. from the one on 64 it looks like you are going a lot faster, in this one it looks like i am on the interstate doing 60 mph. i don't think they should have slowed it down any. what's the point of doing 400mph if it looks like you are doing 60."
2,Get the original,"i bought this because i wanted to see if there were any improvements over the original... absolutely none. i had the original on N64 and to me the gameplay and graphics were way better on the original. i have it also on dreamcast and the sound and graphics are better. this game offers new tracks. but to me they suck, there simple and the AI are a little smarter but the controls aren't smooth and its hard to control, plus the customization of the pods are there eitherso i have nothing good to say about this game. maybe if they remake it again in with the design systems of today i might appreciation the graphics if they do a really good job. but i doubt they will remake this game, it didn't have a big audience then. i would appreciate it but i not gonna cry over not having a new one.play the original. on dreamcast or n64 if you have those systems. or get a really good emulator for pc and game on that.(there aren't that many reliable Emulators so make sure you do your research)"
4,"Plenty of show , not enough GO","True - this game has plenty of action, the sound and graphics are second to none and you'll finish each race swaety and short of breath. The only problem is I finished the whole game in one afternoon.Basically, the main part of the game is tournament mode, which includes 13 races. I finished them with 10 Golds (1st place) and 3 Silvers. There are no game levels or added types of play, so once you win the trophy, there's really no reason to play again.I really recommend this game - to rent, not to buy."
4,Great quality music,"I have been hearing so much about this band for the past 2 years.I finally decided to order it through amazon.I am not at all a death or black metal fan,coz either it's toomonotonous or just noise.But once I started playing this cd ,I was amazed at the quality of the muscianship of these guysand vocals of stanne.Then why only 4 stars you may ask.Well I wish stanne could use some variations in his vocals.just a minor complaint,SO GO BUY THIS CD.Check out fellowswedes opeth's new album ""ghost reveries"": great progressivedeath metal."
4,Character Review,"Two awesome songs ""Senses Tide"" and ""The Endless Feed"". The rest of the cd is good. This is my first Dark Tranquillity CD, and I intend to buy more based on this album."
5,Great Product,A great and healthy protein addition to any diet. An ingredient list that does not include 15 things I need a chemistry or biology degree to understand. It is worth the little bit of extra money for a quality product that is good for you. Very happy with this product.
3,Intelligent and intriguing but failed to captivate me,"Robin, the book's [anti-] hero, is an eternal student, making no progress on his thesis, but making a mess of his life in the meantime.Almost as if it was written as the events occurred, one chapter at a time, with no sense of what would follow, the book flips back and forth from the narrative to Robin's short stories. Although well-written, it is almost self-consciously so, so that it doesn't let you flow with it, and although witty (in an ironic / sarcastic way) and funny in parts, it doesn't really allow you to laugh with it, as the overall feeling is rather sad.This is not a book you'll regret reading, but it was a bit too melancholy for my liking, and definitely not up to the expectations I'd built up based on his previous boks."
3,Uninspiring,"Ake: The Years of Childhood has some interesting depictions of Nigeria in the late 1930' and early 40's from which a Westerner can learn. As the title indicates that the work is more about the town Ake than about Soyinka himself as a child, perhaps that shold have been expected. However, I was hoping for more autobiographical insights. I had read Tolstoy's ""Childhood"" just before ""Ake"" and was stunned by the detail and verisimilitude of Tolstoy's remembered emotions in his reminiscences. Soyinka's ""Ake"" pales by comparison."
3,Good Book,"The novel is quite good, however certain words and phrases do not add much meaning to the trend of what is going on; they are superflous. On the whole it it a good novel."
4,Ake is a character,I laughed at the antics Ake was guilty of because I experienced similar events with my American born and raised boys. Boys will be boys where ever they live
1,Aptly named clunker,"Just like Mike, a stupid, clumsy and single-minded exercise in ruining a good sport. Limited movement, no depth, little challenge and a dull format - this turkey is bound for the dumpster.Take a pass on this one and don't waste your time."
2,so-so,"I was thrilled by the speaker phone feature, as I seem to be on hold often. Unfortunately, I find it doesn't work well. It often cuts out, then when I go back to regular mode it is so soft I can barely hear it. I have to go back to the base to get the sound to a reasonable volumn. Furthermore, it is very difficult to hold it between your shoulder and your ear."
5,MB's Mandalas Are An Inter-Galactic Language,"It's fascinating to see Martha's mandalas, and it's more fascinating to communicate with them. On day I had the urgeto know these mandalas better. Instinctively I moved my open palm back and forth over the mandala, and I felt frequencies coming up to my open palm. My hand picked up frequencies, my soul translated this message to my mind through my nervous system. I was thrilled that this could happen this way.And this can happen to each mandala. It helps to be in an altered meditative state at first, but once one knows how to work with this language, it becomes easier. These messagesare intergalactic because of the messages they release to the person holding it and wanting to receive the message. Intent is important. Intelligent beings can understand each other through an exchange of these mandalas. This is a grand gift to planet Earth for human beings'initial communication once more to the Universe.Thanks to Martha Bartfeld."
5,"THIS IS SHEAR POETRY, THE TRUTH BEYOND WORDS.",The Magic Mandala Coloring Book is an extraordinary right brain experience...and more. The images stretch and pull you into other dimensions. Here you can glimpse the vastness and wholeness of the universe. But this book isn't just an experience for the mind. It is as if in the process of coloring the mandalas you can actually feel other dimensions conveyed through every cell of your body. Truly remarkable.
3,Does E-Prime Represent a Paradigm Shift?,"This monograph presents Ms. Roberts' in-depth analysis of relationships between general semantics (Korzybski's science-oriented educational discipline for cultivating critical thinking skills) and E-Prime (Bourland's English without verbs such as ""is,"" ""am,"" ""was,"" and ""were""). Roberts' used Thomas Kuhn's important book, THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS, as the basis for her unique and interesting approach. To assist readers, Roberts provided an accurate summary of Kuhn's theory. Does E-Prime represent a paradigm revolution? Judge for yourself. By reading this monograph, I became aware of ""family ties"" among scientific method, general semantics, and E-prime."
2,operation of saw,I can not get the handle to lock when the blade is extended beyond the rest position.Cam Boa or anyone else give me a hint how to use this hacksaw?thanks to whoever can answer my question.Ernst
5,Great for advanced beginners.,"Finally, a book of toy knitting patterns for the advanced beginner!If you know how to cast on and bind off, and increase and decrease using any old method, you can make everything in this book.Unlike Debbie Bliss' books, the patterns do NOT require: 1) knitting in the round so no circular needles needed, 2) knitting on double-pointed needles, 3) knowledge of intarsia, 4) knowledge of short row shaping, 5) yarn overs, provisional cast-on, button-hole or lace making, or any other intermediate techniques.All you need is two needles, yarn, and a needle for sewing up the pieces.Thankfully, there aren't a zillion pieces in each pattern, weird gussets or anything requiring charts. The toys knit up fast in 1 or 2 evenings, so there is almost instant gratification."
1,disappointed,"got product Itransfer DVDs2, which transfers DVDs to Apple Ipod , followed direction on the DVD and could not get product registered... it was rejected each time I tried...... sent 3 e-mails no response yet."
3,Very Adult - Very Involved Game,"DO NOT GET THIS GAME FOR YOUR KIDS. If you are an adult and enjoy playing it, it seems pretty involved and cool (but if you have a spouse, they may divorce you before you finish it - it says here it can take 70 hours - my guess is longer). Graphics are lacking to me, but it is very intense, and overall good."
3,this game is cool if........................,1. You dont like saving your game with out a controller pack 2. You like good graphics 3. You like good music 4. You like games that are so frusterating that you want to through stuff at the t.v.all in all if u are patient then buy this game if not then buy a lot of t.v.s
1,Kindle version - No images,"I own the paper version of this book and bought the kindle version as soon as I could get my hands on the new kindle. Unfortunately the ebook does not contain any images and is useless as a reference, study book as such.I am an avid fan of Hua-Ching Ni and his work and I can recommend his books very highly, but I cannot recommend the ebook version!! Do not buy. Paper version: BUY!"
5,great shipping,my girlfriend loved her poster. only thing i didn't get was why charge me for shipping twice when both posters came in one tube?? either way it came quick and it was a great poster.can't wait to but a poster for myself from pop culture graphics!
3,Beware of incomplete downloads,"A good way to save photos BUT you must be vigilant when downloading. Make sure that you check immediately upon completion of the download to make sure ALL the photos were downloaded. I neglected to do this and lost many many photos! The unit shuts off after a mere 30 seconds, so you have to watch the download and immediately upon seeing the 100% indicator, hold the ""Enter"" button to make sure all the images were in fact downloaded. If you neglect to do this, the 30 sec. shut off will kick in and you'll not be able to make sure all the images were downloaded. The 30 second automatic shut off creates havoc. There does not seem to be any way to go back to the #of files and folders once you've shut the Digital Foci off, you can only access the available space at that point."
4,Simple interface great memory card backup,"There are a market basket full of devices to view and store digital images. The Digital Foci product is actually designed as a storage-only device - no viewing. With that in mind, it does the job perfectly, and faster than an older device that I owned in the past. It even supports the new 4GB and up SD cards, unlike several card readers that I own.Battery life if fine, and the charger is wonderfully small (I've had other devices where the charger is 2x the size of the backup unit itself.4 stars only because the interface is VERY simple (copy or delete). That is a blessing (very easy to use) and a curse (no editing/viewing/checking file names/sizes/etc.). Also I wish you could do incremental backup of the same card (so ""new"" pictures are copied to the same backup rather than wasting space/time doing everything from the beginning again)."
2,CF card docking poorly designed,"The Digital Foci is very easy to use. I ordered 2 battery so I could keep a spare charged and ready. One of the batteries was bad so Amazon replaced it at no charge or hassle, but now one of the pins for the CF card docking stations is misaligned. If one is not careful when inserting the card, the pins can easily be bent. In all of my camera's and card readers, the pins are recessed deep enough to keep the card aliened while inserting it. The Foci's pins are placed too shallow in the slot allowing the card to go in at an angle bending the pins. I am going to Italy and Africa in 08, but am hesitant to take it with me."
5,Works like its supposed to,Nice product. I like the flexibility of this design. Recharges from your usb port or from the included charger. At 120GB this now serves as both my file transfer and backup device for my work files plus my travel bank for my cameras. It handles both Xd and SDHC cards with no problem. VERY simple interface. Nice little case. Battery is a little small but I don't know if that will be a problem for me yet - but I can buy a spare if needed. Specs say it will download 9GB on a charge which should be fine.I brought a recertified unit from the manufacturer with no problems.
5,Nothin' like tomorrow,"This song just slays me. I thought I'd buy the album one song at a time. Now, I don't know if there is reason to buy any more music at all. I'm done gone.Maybe I'm just experiencing the beats, harmonies and syn-aesthetic visual textures that have accrued through a lifetime of ""musical devotion"".Maybe I'm just in love.Being the ultimate slacker, I think I'll just play that song again. Work? Me? ... forget it. That's for another day. Right now, ""There's nothing like tomorrow"". Then, maybe I'll engage in irregular progression from bar to bar... Or let the song do it for me."
2,Drop the vocals and you have a great album,I really wanted to like this CD. I was totally crushed when I discovered how instrusive the vocal tracks were. I think that without the vocals this album could rank as a top 'chill out' piece. I have a wide variety of this music (with and without vocals) and just wish they'd release this album without.IMHOcr
3,"Good, but not great.","This certainly is a polished production. Its smooth, loungy trip/hop (as another review stated) with some dub influences. Everything works well, but nothing stands out for me. Certain songs like ""You're Always the Sun"" are really pretty darn good. Overall, the vocals are nice without being riveting and the beats will get your head nodding without making you break out dancing on the subway while listening to this on your walkman/discman.I would definitely throw this on late at night sometimes or while hanging out on the weekend, its just not necessarily something I'd listen to all the time. If you are looking for some seriously fantastic music of this sort pick up Morcheeba, Everything But the Girl, or Olive. If you are looking to add to your collection after already picking up those CDs, this is not a bad way to go."
4,mellow but fun,"Everyone has named all those similar sounding bands already, so I'll continue the game. Yes there are sonic similarities to Morcheeba and Portishead, neither of whom I like, but it's less dark and samey than either and has heaps more soul and verve. Someone even mentioned Yello - good grief I hadn't noticed it but it's true. But this band are more than a collection of influences, they've found their own voice on this one. Great for driving or late-night listening."
3,cool but too cool,"I bought the cd amid the hype(i live in LA) and at first listen it was the perfect blend of atmosphere, uptempo trip hop and cool soundtrack-ish stuff. Then i realized that i already own it, in the form of sneaker pimps, morcheeba et al. Its hard to resist, as none of those bands has a new disk. Buy it i say, but dont be surprised if you feel compelled to move into a huge loft downtown and start growing facial hair. Can anyone recommend the perfect blend of zinging techno and tricky-inspired acid-hop? Im game."
2,Blah!,"I was depending on the good judgement of other reviewers (4 stars based on 75 reviews... it *should* be good). Lord, was that a mistake.Now, it's not all bad: it's just so easily forgettable. What did 'Sublime' sound like? Hell if I remember. How about 'Golddigger'? I only recall an annoying woman repeating the words 'gold digguh' and wanting to flip to the next track.The disc is way too short, too: 45 or so minutes? Give me a BREAK! There's a half hour of unused space on this disc, people. Talented artists can, do, and WANT to fill it all.The songs are too poppish and shallow to be anything more than background noise. If you're looking for weak music to cover up the dead air of your boring party, here you go."
3,what happened?,"Great album. Really cool site too. My only complaint it Geri's voice...The album seems to show her as really being able to sing. However when I listened to their show on KCRW I was almost scared by her vocals. That was not the first time I heard her sound like that. There was some internet show they did and replayed on their site. Can we pick a key and not go flat? I'm starting to understand the production/programming part of the album...they really must have worked on her voice. The music has little suprises in it that you discover/rediscover with every listen making it hard to stop...the whole ""fake singer"" thing sort of holds me back from truely believe this is as perfect as it could have been. Buy the cd because it's great...check out their show on KRCW's site to decide if you believe it..."
3,Solid but unorigninal effort of trip-pop,"This release from SBL owes a lot in style to Esthero, Morcheeba and Mono. (Especially in the string arrangements and vocal style) Although it is a solid set of 11 songs in the electronica-pop genre, and several songs are in fact quite infectious, there is a lack of freshness and surprises, which are the reasons why music in this genre is exciting. Recommended only to those who are starving from the recent lack of trip-pop output."
2,Ain't Nothin New,"SBL sounds like a very much calculated and formulaic slick studio production. The guys aim high but unfortunately they don't have the substance that is necessary to make it happen. Although each track on this album is individually fun to listen to, when you listen to the entire album you can't help but think of other bands who had been in these waters before.It is almost impossible to talk about a band identity so the album very quickly becomes boring after a few spins. I'm not sure how far anybody can go by simply creating hollow stylish tunes. To me they sound like they're gonna jump on to the next trend train and have a drastic sound shift in their second effort. After all music business is all about making cash !"
1,oh dear,"this album is really not very good. it sounds something like a cross between morcheeba and massive attack, except in one important detail - talent. or lack thereof. particularly the female vocalist, whose voice is just plain dreary. i challenge you to listen to this whole cd before sticking it back in the case never to be played again."
1,Starbucks Music,"Yes, I confess: I bought this at Starbucks. The barrista was too slow with my double short latte, and my tired brain succumbed to the Schultz marketing machine. They had a kiosk with cds and headphones.It DID sound pretty good with the cheap headphones at the coffee shop - laid back, with a James Bond twist. When I listened to it closely, I heard a singer with no emotion, no range, and fake attitude, trying (and failing) to sound like the best of Morcheeba, insipid lyrics, and silly annoying hooks. I thought maybe it would grow on me, perhaps if I didn't listen too hard. Whoever said you can get used to anything was wrong.There are lots of solid trip hop cds. This is a no-talent group out to capitalize on a trend. Look elsewhere."
1,watered down rip off music,"groove armada should be ashamed of themselves. when they rip off a style they rip off the artists that originated the style. they are theives. worse and even blander than thievary corperation.if you are aware of this genre in music you know that there are excellent new cds from smith and mighty, tosca, and peace orchestra. support real artists. not corperate mercenary assasins stealing food from the mouths of the true innovators."
1,small town wanna bees,"supreme beings of leisure should be ashamed of themselves. when they rip off a style they rip off the artists that originated the style. they are theives. worse and even blander than thievary corperation.if you are aware of this genre in music you know that there are excellent new cds from smith and mighty, tosca, and peace orchestra. support real artists. not corperate mercenary assasins stealing food from the mouths of the true innovators."
3,Good start but could be better.....,"Although this CD is better than most of what is on top of the Billboard Album/CD Chart (what isn't these days? )it doesn't sound quite as good when put up to the new releases by Groove Armada and the amazing new CD by Presence, ""All Systems Gone."" The focal point of the CD is its single ""Strange Love Addiction"" and I must admit the only reason I bought the CD. Like a lot of single driven CD's there is not much on the CD that holds up to ""SLA."" Most tracks knock off Portishead production style and lack any real defining or original sound. I think packaging wins here over substance. My rec: buy the single and spend your money on the new Presence CD."
5,A lucky find,"I had the luck to see SBL open up for Macy Gray at Sony's Y2K E3 party in L.A., and they blew me away. Techno-ish with a very razor sharp feminine edge in the lyrics. I love this album."
3,Pleasant enough...but lacking.,"Ehh....I'm inclined to agree with the other person who said this CD is too ... cosmo. I have a pretty eclectic taste in music (everything from aphex twin to ani difranco), and this CD does not stand out as anything special, in my opinion.It does sound like it's straight out of LA -- and what soul it has is dry. This album has obviously been marketed towards the younger ""techno"" groups -- and doesn't come near matching up to the divine trip-hop of other artists, such as morcheeba, massive attack, or sneaker pimps, even. It's not an overly bad CD, no, it'd be a nice thing to play in the background, but it's nothing too extraordinary. It's got some groove, but save your $$ and buy it half price."
4,Smooth and sassy.,"I first heard this album at a listening station in a Virgin Records store and was instantly entranced. Track 2 ""Golddigger"" feels like an old 60s spy movie and is what sold me to begin with.If you love lounge with a little trip-hop, this is the album to get. The vocalist is reminiscent of Swing Out Sister while the tracks fall somewhere between Portishead and Morcheeba.I give this 4 stars because (I believe) this is their first album and I know they'll get better."
5,Are you ready?,"If the recent Grammy Awards are any indication, the world is truly in dire need of creative inspiration within the musical community. What we the groove tripping public need is a freaking miracle. And that miracle has arrived in the form of four supremely lovely individuals - Ramin, Rick, Kiran & Geri. This quarter has packed more beats into the ridges of a CD then is humanly possible. From the hovering whoosh the slides you into the opening track, Never The Same, to the sassy spiral that closes the last track, Under The Gun, this CD keeps you bumping with every track. Each artist in this band brings to the table a shiny set of groove utensils, with the most beautiful Geri Soriano-Lightwood serving up a vocal harmony that will please the most hardy of listeners. Quick, break ranks, snarl at the zombies who yearn for conformity, buy this CD and I guarantee that you'll bump to every track. Or you can go vote for GW Bush Jr."
4,Just a lazy cat in a dog-eat-dog world...,"The opening line to ""Golddigger,"" the second track on this groove-laden album from the LA-based quartet. The songs range from electronic-jazz-pop on such tracks as ""Golddigger"" and ""Truth From Fiction"" to danceable grooves with no overpowering bass thumps like ""Strangelove Addiction"" and ""You're Always the Sun."" They mix a space-age lounge feel with electronica, perfect for relaxing or dancing. With fantastic programming by Ramin Sakurai, Kiran Shahani, and Rick Torres and smooth vocals from Geri Soriano-Lightwood, this album is a must-have and has quickly become one of the albums I listen to over and over. Favorite tracks: ""Golddigger,"" ""Strangelove Addiction"" and ""Sublime."""
2,Could've been better....hope the next one is,"I bought this CD because I heard their single on the radio and thought it was pretty cool. Come to find that that's the only one on the album I listen to without having to think of other artists. This band is experimenting in familiar territory. One song is a dead ringer for Madonna, the next is like Erika Badu, etc. We're in a decade of copycat music, it seems, and this album is no different then what you've heard before."
4,Groovy Come-Down Music,"This is one slick album. I ran into it last summer in San Francisco, and since moving to Paris, I've had the pleasure to introduce it to various European friends--this album definitely has international appeal! Geri Soriano-Lightwood's sultry-smooth lounge voice hooks you right away, and combined with an eclectic mix of electronic beats, the result really lends the band a unique sound. I gave this album 4 stars because it is, in fact, perhaps too slick--poppy tunes like ""Golddigger"" seem a little too well-engineered, a little too glossy. In the end, however, this is a solid album. It makes for great come-down music, at the end of a long party just before you head home 'round dawn. Definitely worth a listen."
3,Some exceptional tracks...,"Ok, well here's what I think: I, like many others, bought this CD beacuse of Never the Same. But to be honest that song is very different from the rest on the album. The songs tend to be more like dreamy techno-pop. Other than Never the Same I really like Ain't Got Nothin'. It's got a good bluesy chorus. Golddigger and Last Girl on Earth are pretty good too. My least favorite song is Strangelove Addiction. It's got a good intro then drastically switches to a much faster beat like something out of a dance club. All the other songs tend to get repetitive and when ever I listen to this CD I usually listen to the first half of the album then switch to something else..."
4,amazon predicted my rating .. wierd...,"I am going to try to stay away from all the comparisons. Its fair to say though that this album doesn't exactly OOOZ originality. The vocals are very peppy, and not as blues as I like, and the music is a bit too ""POP"" they are interesting, but not as textured, layered, dark, different as I have grown used in my electronic music. The album does seem highly easy to get into , and should have been really easy to sell. There isn't much here that would make casual music fans hate it. I don't think hardcore music fans will love this that much, unless they just need something to fill the gap.Oh and Freaking Portishead doesn't get old, people just burn out on it cause its so addictive. Both Portishead albums are godly classics that shouldn't be compared to Trip-Pop [hopefuls]."
2,not what it could have been,"I hate to say it, but the new band led by Sid Griffin (80s country rock pioneers the Long Ryders, the Coal Porters) just isn't that good. They start off promisingly with the dreamy opening track, but the slow, ethereal sounds get old fast, especially since the melodies aren't strong enough to hold much interest. Griffin was never the world's greatest tunesmith anyway, and here his slight songs get lost in a vaguely psychedelic C&W haze, like the Byrds on Quaaludes. I wanted to like this, but in truth it bores me to tears. The pseudo-spiritual lyrics don't help. The pedal steel work is very nice, however."
4,A Grower,"In the novel High Fidelity , a record that grows on you is referred to as a ""grower,"" and Western Electric is definitely a grower. Give it one listen, you'll find it somewhat slower-tempo'ed than what you'd expect from Griffin. After two listenings, certain songs will begin to haunt you. After three, you will have been grown-upon. The album builds up, layer by layer, and though it's a cliche to say it, it is definitely a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts. It will be one of those CDs you'll probably play once a day for three months, assuming you're sympathetic to the genre, you'll sing certain tunes at odd moments and even in public places, and then pull the CD out every once in a while because certain cuts will continue to haunt. An achievement for Griffin & Company."
4,Very Cool,"One of the ""most wanted"" items on my 10 year old's Christmas list, Rampage is quick and exciting. However, he finished eating all the cities in one day, so this game probably would suit a younger player."
4,It's a great game,"It's fun,but if you have it for N64,forget about getting it for game boy. It's great,but the graphics stink."
2,boring,"This game has a good backround and idea, but it is exceedingly dull. You go arround jumping on cars and climbing buildings. Big deal. I would almost rather wach golf. If you want to burn money and be bored to death, buy this game."
4,i need help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hi,my name is DANILLE,I LOVE THIS GAME BUT ITS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE..."
1,Waste of time and Money,"So my parents bouhgt me tis game for my brithday. I was kinda confusd y they bouhgt it for me. But i figred hey ill try this game out. Now my expectaions wer very low. And U no what, This game was worse than i thought. Ill talk about the good and bad things about the game. Some good things about the game were Britney spears is hot!! but not in this game because of the bad graphics. The bad things were the horribla grfics and sound. I cant stand her music. The only I would get tis gam is is if yur reaally bored."
5,A Excellent Game!A Must Have For Everyone,"This is a wonderful game,if you have ever dreamed of being one of Britney's back up dancers,this is where it all happens.The fun auditions with the music video in the back,is like so real.I play this game 5 hours a day.It's great.And then if you do better than your competitor,you make the cut,and get to perform with Miss Spears herself!Its my favorite game.So fun!"
1,BOO!!,"This game is really bad and I reccomend you don't get it. If you do get it, the graphics are o.k but the gameplay is really bad."
1,Waste of Money,"Ever since her third album, I was becoming less of a Britney fan. I was stupid to buy this game. I had 30 bucks saved up, so I went out and bought Britney's Dance Beat. It had to be the worst purchase I have ever made! 95% of the game is pressing the A and B buttons as the little spinner goes over the designated letter. Even if I did press it, as someone else said, the game did not register it. It got annoying and boring to sit there for 3 mintutes pressing the A and B buttons over and over and over and over again. You couldn't even watch her dance until the replay. By the time the replay came, I was bored out of my mind. What good is a game when there barely is any challenge? The other 5% of the game was Britney puzzles. Boring. The only thing worth the game was the short clip of Britney singing ""Overprotected"" live. And that was lip-synched. I would give this game less than 1 star if it existed. Don't buy it- IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY! Pokemon even kept me more awake and I hate Pokemon!"
4,DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHETHER IT IS WORTH GETTING THIS GAME???,"we'll lets put it this way i rate it 5 out of 5 of graphics5 out of 5 on song selection and 3 out of 5 on characters(because all the characters are ugly!!! their are no blonde girls!!!) and for difficulty 2 out of 5 lets put it this way the practise mode and first three auditions are made for toddlers!!! and the first and secound concerts are made for primary kids!!! and the last concert is made for intermediate kids and the last level to compete with britney well that is made for britney herself (because its impossible to get through the first time!!!) you have to try about 5 times and my final score to beat her was 8,0000!!! it wasnt easy it took me 3 nights!!! if you wanna know if its worth getting email me at stargirlnzl@hotmail.com"
3,"Oil-Free, but Made Me Break Out...Will Use for Hands","I had high hopes for this night creme as the rest of the line is so good, but whatever they are using for a moisturizer in this night version caused tiny whiteheads wherever I used the creme. Weird, but others here have mentioned the same thing.However, since it's good for fading sunspots (retinol), I will keep for using on the backs of my hands. :)You win some, you lose some."
5,"Holy crap, came really fast and it's awesome!","Holy crap, this came like within two days and it works really, really well! For the price that it is, it's really good quality."
5,Effective Without the Grease,This is the cream that performs as promised. It does deliver some noticeable impact in making the skin look younger and does make the skin feel smoother. It goes on easy and quickly works its way into the skin without the greasy residue. You can apply and go out without the shiny look. It also does not get that sheen on the face when you sweat. The more expensive creams can definitely take a lesson from Neutrogena with this product. It is on my standard list of repurchases from Amazon.
4,Awesome!,"This is just what my skin needed. I have been using Arbonne moisturizer for about a year and thought I liked it. BUT my face was an oil slick after applying it. I thought that's what all moisturizers did. Not so with Neutrogena! This moisturizes my combination skin without my face looking oily afterwards. I'm 35 and starting to get fine lines. I haven't used the product long enough to see how it affects the lines (thus the 4 stars.) Even if it does nothing to the lines, it's a GREAT product for me."
5,Totally awesome,"Do your research, know yourself and your needs. I have used this one for a few years and I like it. My wife and I both use it. This is affordable and works well overall. We both don't have overly oily or dry skin so we're able to use a myriad of products with success. This has retinol in it, so if you're sensitive to that you might want to look elsewhere. My view on facial products is that you shouldn't expect a miracle or huge change - that's totally unrealistic. But you should expect something that seems to help a bit with aging and moisture - this one does that for both of us. We'll likely keep use this one for a while."
3,It's good but not for me.,This product is very nice and creamy but it made me break out a little so I think it's too heavy for me.
2,Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream,"This cream didn't do a whole lot for me. I'm not that wrinkled, in my early 50's, not a lot of sun damage. But I did not notice any appreciable change in the appearance of myfine lines, even after 3 months of use. It does go on smoothly, and did not cause irritation or breakouts. Will likely try something different when this tube is used up."
2,Neutrogena,Good use as night lotion! As creme doesn't works as perfect care!? This is just a lotion in expensive tube!
3,If only without the smell...,"I don't like the smell of it (smells like medicine)... so since I purchased it probably 6 months ago, I have not used it much... it's a waste.Won't buy it again."
1,Leaves greasy feeling,This applies smoothly and feels good on my skin right after application but it ends up making my skin feel oily and greasy. This breaks me out when I use it on my face but I don't want to let the tube go to waste so I started using it on my neck. It doesn't irritate my neck because my skin isn't as sensitive there.
2,At first it was great and then I broke out,When I first got this product 1 month ago I felt like the texture felt great on my skin and I loved the fact that it is oil free. After 1.5 weeks of using this my face started to break out. I started off with 1 zit and now I can count 6. I think it would be a great product for someone with dry skin but not combination or oily.
3,Box is broken!,"This product is really awesome! I'm using it everyday or I've been using it for more than a year. I can recommend this product 100% to my friends, but problem is the packaging it is very bad."
4,"Noticed Nothing, But I Am ALso 25","I tried this out because of the great reviews. I didn't really notice much of a difference, but that could be because I don't have any wrinkles..."
2,Meh,"I purchased this bc I read it was a good OTC retinol product. It didn't work well for me at all. I much prefer Neutrogena Tone Correcting Serum and cream. The tone correcting serum also has retinol and I had typical retinol effects with that one, which is what I was hoping for with this product:I wil not repurchase this unless it was on super sale, lol. However, I will purchase the Tone Correcting serum again as that provided better retinol results than this did."
4,"Love this nightly lotion, but don't expect miracles","I'm only 25, but I thought it was easier to keep skin LOOKING young than to try and make it look younger so I thought it was time to start taking care of i. I'm not sure if it made me look any younger (I already get mistaken for highschoolers as it is), but it did help decrease the appearance of a forehead crease I've had since I was 13. I don't think this product is strong enough to REVERSE a lot of age damage, but based on research it seems to be the best on the market for its price-range. Although the tube looks fairly small, it lasted me a couple of months. I added this to my nightly treatment of stridex."
5,Great Night Cream,This cream feels great on my dry skin. I apply it over a serum and together it helps my skin stay hydrated. It goes on smoothly and sinks in right away.
3,Ok,"I have to use this book for graduate school, it has some very useful information but I find this book rather boring."
1,Chill out...,"No where in this description does it make the claim that this is an Xbox 360! It's just a Special Edition Xbox. Just chill out, dude!"
1,Weak Sauce,"Xbox is obsolete, why pay $300 for a bright green Xbox when you could buy a new Wii for the same price or throw $100-200 more for a X360?"
1,Ask yourself.............. why?,Why would anybody buy this? Its the exact same thing as a origional xbox nothing different besides the color. Why dont you just buy a black xbox and get a can of spray paint and paint it lime green if you want it so bad!! lol
1,Really Stupid,"Why not just buy an Xbox 360 and a PS3 if you have the money to buy this crap? This is just a rip-off. Its just an ugly green Xbox (which, as of a month ago, is obsolete).Dont waste your money."
4,Collectors Item,"Please people, this is a collector's item. Itll be worth thousands in the future. Look at the gi joes and transformers."
3,Aplets,I can not find the cotlets in these packages. The applet parts are darn close to the original and quite good.
3,Purely for fun,"Asked to give my opinion on this book by a reader of these reviews, I obtained the book and ""read"" it. There really is very little to read....more magazine copy to titillate and keep the romp through these photos of contemporary pop icons rolling. Actually, once past the fact that this is not a serious message book or startle book or pretentiously arty book, this is a fun collection of stars having a campy hoot of a time. The photography isn't always that great, but the mood is. Definitely fluff category stuff, but fun at that!"
2,acupuncture points of equine,I LIKED THIS VIDEO.THIS IS QUIET HELPFUL FOR THE PEOPLE PRACTISING IN ASIA AS PEOPLE THERE DONT HAVE THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ACUPUNCTURE WORKS BUT THEY ARE PRACTISING THERE.
3,Rainbow 6....... with Mobile Suits!!!!!!!,"First off this game is not a RTS (real time strategy) like another reviewer said. It's more of a squad based (or company based if you want to get technical) tactical simulator. You control up to three platoons (3 MS's each) of suits and assign weapons, pilots, equipment and orders to each. You also assign routes, waypoints and rules of engagement to each platoon (avoid or attack). The controls in mission are ok but until you get the last MS (I forgot the name) you don't have very much in the way of mobility. (The fact that your MS's have paper thin armor doesnt help the situation any.) All in all its a good game with a good amount of strategy and action thrown in."
4,zeonic front review,"I thought that this game would be awesome like journey to jaburo, but i didn't like it nearly as much. It is a very hard and strategic game. I haven't beat it but i have been playing it forever. if you like long, hard games then this is the game for you. The controls aren't nearly like those on journey to jaburo. It is a fun game."
5,Good Game But SO SO HARD!,"This game is fantastic yet the missions get progresively harder and if you watch the anime special movie, or the basic Gundam series, you find out that the Principality of Zeon ultimately loses which doesn't do much for your morale fighting for the losing team. Still great game, the controls are somewhat complicated and the strategy element is there but you really have to play it to get it."
4,char,"Zeonic Front is great game but there are a couple problems. One thing is their aren't enough diffrent types of mobile suits,to use in campain missions .But there are a couple good things about it also,one thing is you eventualy get to use amuro,sayla,char,and garma.And also from what I've heard the gatling sheild is not in the game.Oh yes you can also use some other pilots and some new mobile suits.Oh yes I forgot to tell you gelgoog,Z'Gok,and some other mobile suits are't in this.There are also federation simulation missins, you get around the time you're about to finish round 2 in campain missions.There are Round 1,andRound 2 campain,and simulation missions. GOOD LUCK"
3,A Good Game for a good price,this game isn't that bad but the thing that i dislike is that when you go up to attack someone (and in the manual it says to fall back and let your teammates to it) your teamates follow after you so you have to go up and kill them your self. but if your thinking that this game is violent which you shouldn't its not at all. its just a game like everything else. but the best part about this game is having the teams and can control each of them. so if this is a mom reading this and you have a kid who likes games get him this. because he'll like it.
5,Zeonic Front......A gamers dream.......get out and get it!!!,Zeonic Front...a gamers dream....get out of that recliner and get it!!!!I got this game from my mom for easter and i screamed! i was waiting forever to get it. anyway i loaded it up and got to work.i beat it twice.it took awhile but its awsome you can make sweet combos like Rick dom with a beam rifle.if you like the recent GUNDAM JOURNEY TO JABORO this is a MUST HAVE!it has awsome graffics.Ill will say hi to the older leage of reviewers out there i LOVE your reviwes!!! E-mail me!!!!see ya on the flipside gamers.i hope this reveiw helped you i havent done this before.
3,What in the,"What happend this game is easy untill you get to like lv 12, when that wite sute can shut you down in 1 shot! This game has a problem. In the beggining just let your leader get shot and the rest of the team beets the game. All the other rounds are easy but 1 is hard. I am a long time player of games, but this one whent way to low, How can you say this is evin good. Some mobile sutes can detect you withought seing you and also they dont need to be anywere neer you. Its a good game but you should not buy it, rent it and you will c what i am saying."
2,Moblie suit gundam zeonic front,"I bought This game a while back now I have to say this is the hardest game I have ever played. I'm a long time gundam fan and thought it would be good because a friend recommended it,don't waste you're money on this crap hard contols the enemies are aways better in so kind of way usually in numbersPostives1.NoneNegative1.The game alway sets you against a Plethora of enemies2.Way to hard even hardcore gamers how feel the pressure3.you can be killed in a shot4.It feels like The enemies always have a upperhand on you with weapones5.You're teamsmates aren't to bright6.They promise 40mission but they're only 127.Scarcity of moblie suits8.It takes forever to get a new mobile suit it's that can still died in a hitIf you're a hardcore gamer that love a challege this game was made for youif you're a poor sport about losing at a game DON'T buy this you might just throw you're tv out the window"
1,this game [is really bad],"this game [is really bad], I mean you can't even boost, the controls are extremely hard to memerise and you can't even get past the seventh level because you have to fight the Gundam, the Guntank, and the Guncannon! and one hit by the Gundam and you're dead so this game [is really bad]"
5,Best Gundam Game Yet,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. You get to pilot your own Zakus, along with two other teammates with you. You get to plan own your missions and routes. You get upgrades on your mobile suits and get new pilots. It has a simulator that will help you train and practice. Some of the missions only last about 2 minutes while others can last over 5 minutes. If you really like Gundam, you should definitely get this game."
4,Mesh Fishing Vest Good Purchase,"I purchased the Winning Edge Men's Mesh Fishing Life Vest as a Christmas present for my father. My father would rather spend all day fishing than anything else, but due to declining health, has been falling a lot lately. For peace of mind I wanted a life vest for him to wear while fishing.I was very happy with the vest once I received it. It was light weight and not cumbersome, so I'm hopeful my dad will wear it regularly. It seems I made a good purchase. I would recommend the vest to anyone who would like added safety without feeling loaded down with a heavy vest."
3,Good but seems to not be for the larger sizes it suggests,"I like it, it's up but seems to droop if fully extended over a period of time.. Meaning as tight as you can make it, a heavy LCD at full extension of the bracket might be a little too much to handle.. I'd recommend for the lighter set for sure."
4,Easy Model but no poseability,My son received this model for Christmas. He has about 3 or 4 Gundam models and is disappointed in this one because it has no joint poseability.
5,Hilarious!,"This book was hilarious! I laughed-out-loud several times. The best scenes were: Gretchen helping her cousin with her resume, Gretchen taking the boss's niece to lunch and hearing all about her last ""job"", Gretchen's tipsy slip in the snow and almost-kiss, and Brett's laughable seduction of an intern on his show. Very funny stuff :-) Besides the comedy there as a down-right intriguing mystery that kept me guessing and some steamy romance thrown in for good measure. Definitely pick this one up to brighten your day."
2,not impressed,"i'm shocked at how well this book was rated because i had the hardest time trying to get through it.The love story is very weak : firefighter saves girl and conincidently keeps running into her. they both want each other yet like highschool kids play silly games, giving the other mixed messagesthe mystery: who's trying to ruin the firefighters well known celebrity brother?It didn't make me laugh, wasn't arousing, barley engaging. in my opinion it was a waste"
1,Not a book for the clean minded,"I was hoping that this author was good but was shocked. The reason I bought these is because the titles were interesting. The titles did not convey the filthy language, the pornographic suggestions (I didn't finish the book so don't know what the end was like). I deleted all of her books from my kindle and am very sorry I even paid a penny for them."
3,Misleading but...,"The puzzles included in this book contain require no math and only a little logic. A more appropriate title would be ""Guessing Puzzles"" because solving them requires a lot of luck.Other than the misleading title and content, I found that the puzzles themselves lacked true variety; they all require the same basic skills. The only true difference between them is the format.I have seen better books of this nature. The puzzles from the World Puzzle Championships, by Will Shortz, although not my cup of tea, are authentic, and require a wider spectrum of skills.In addition, for those looking for actual mathematical puzzles, consider anything by Martin Gardner or H.E. Dudeney.With all of this said, the only reason I give this book a passing grade is for its reasonable price and large volume of puzzles. If you enjoy ""lateral logic"" and possibility, then you may get more from the book than myself."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE for florescent lights,Installed this product today and they do not work with compact florescent lights. The lights just flickered on and off at dust. Install a regular light bulb and I was not impressed with the performance.
3,Adjustment required,"Day 2 with this adjustment knob and it seems to be working great. As one of the other reviewers said DO NOT use this for CF bulbs. It applies power based on it's light sensor and a partial charge seems to short CF bulbs. When I got it installed (which was easy enough to screw in), I had to use a screwdriver to slide the adjustment slider a little and now it works perfectly. My door is in a heavily wooded area but it still is sensitive enough to know the difference between night and day and begins to come on at dusk like it is supposed to. Wonderful device.Edit:Day 8 and it is still working as I expected. It dims with more daylight so it stays off generally after the late morning to late afternoon and it comes on on rainy days.Edit:Week 2 and it seems not to really adjust anymore, not sure what happened. Stays on all the time now."
4,Loved it from the first page!,"Very nice book, with lots of great advice and practical tips, including many websites for different products and services. This publication is useful and created with taste and great expertise. One of the better decorating books on the market. Highly recommended!"
5,Cuddly little finger puppet,Great little bear to go with Bear Tunes DVD/CD; the bear is well made and a friendly little guy children will enjoy.
1,BAD TWEEZERS.TOO EXPENSIVE AND DON' T WORK WELL.,"I was told that this tweezer is the best one to buy and even though it was so expensive, I justified the purchase because I do my own eyebrows.I was extremely disapointed because after about a day the tweezers lost their initial precision and ability to pluck my hairs. I am now looking for another pair of tweezers to buy since these don't work with the really short hairs and instead of plucking some other hairs it just tears them not from the root."
5,Four Tops/50th Anniversary Concert,"Excellent DVD! I watch it quite often. The Four Tops could not have picked a better singer to replace Levi Stubbs. Theo Peoples is a phenomenal singer! I cry each time I watch it and they bring Levi out on the stage. I also cry to see the love between Duke, Obie and Levi, as they wipe his tears away. This is a must have for Four Tops fans."
4,four tops 50th anniversary,"my favorite motown group period. would have thought more motown acts would have been there. great show, broke my heart to see levi in the condition he was in. made me respect him all the more. likely his last performance. buy it, it's history."
5,Extraordinary,One of my favourites soul singing groups of all times. There no words to desdribe it. A magnificent piece of work.
3,Mmmmmm.... no.,"It's hard to explain why exactly, but this book didn't catch the attention of anybody in my household. The tiny vocabulary and phrases section at the beginning of each chapter is kind of handy, containing words and phrases like please, thank you, pass me, spicy, oven, etc., mostly keeping in the spirit of the kitchen theme. The included cassette tape is good for ear and pronunciation training. But the activities -- which range from gathering dry alphabet letters from alphabet soup to sticking stickers on loosely sketched pictures of bowls, trays, etc., to actually doing a little cooking -- just didn't strike a chord with us.Is it right for your family? If your kids like hanging around in the kitchen with you and you have time to sit down with them and go through the drills and activities (and seek out things like dry alphabet noodles and cookie ingredients), then quite possibly it is. All I can tell you is, it just didn't catch on in my house... and we live in Italy."
4,The Making of HHGTTG,"This really isn't a guide, listing characters and what-not, as much as it is a book about the making of the original radio series, then the book, tv series, theatrical production, ""musical"", and computer game, mainly written from the point of view of Douglas Adams. It's an entertaining read, with many quotes by Mr. Adams and the people he worked with. Neil Gaiman (of Sandman fan) does a fine job with it."
3,"Well, it was just another planet","damn, this book was funny as hell! the main character was always getting into screwy situations, it seemed as if everything was going wrong for him and then the best thing happened, the planet blew up. maybe it wasnt the best thing, but it shure was a turning point for him. after the planet goes the story delivers non-stop laughs and the craziest things happen, this story keeps you giggling and interested until the very last word. i would reccomend this book to someone looking for a really un-serious story of complete mayhem and calamity."
1,Kindle version an unreadable mess,"The basic problem here is that Durling's original was designed for facing pages of English and Italian. Durling's book, however, was dumped to the Kindle without the slightest regard for the fact that the Kindle's ""page"" size has nothing to do with the page size of the original -- in fact, of course, the Kindle doesn't even have a fixed ""page"" size. So, what do you get in the Kindle version? You get 30 lines of English followed by 30 lines of Italian, then 30 more lines of English, and so on. How this will break on your Kindle screens is completely arbitrary. For the Kindle, the text needed to be re-organized and it just wasn't. A quality version of Inferno on Kindle would be most welcome, but this isn't it.Save your money. This is the worst, most incompetent Kindle transfer I've seen."
1,Review of the Kindle edition of Durling's Inferno,"Great in hard copy, but the Kindle edition destroys the text. The facing page arrangement of Italian poem and English prose translation becomes alternating undifferentiated blocks of prose; they didn't even preserve the verse form of the Italian. Disgraceful work by the publishers."
4,Excellent footnotes,"Dante's Divine Comedy is a strange puzzle to sort out. I feel it was written for highly personal reasons. One that is evident is his love of Virgil and the Homeric Greek epics. He also crafted this poem as a cathartic release, as a means to slander his enemies. And man, if the measure of a man is his enemies (choose them carefully) then Dante is quite the fellow. Don't read Divine Comedy as poetry, get the whole picture as it is more fascinating than fiction.That's what makes this edition so handy, you're tempted to read it as epic poem but this edition offers all the contextual clues you need from reliable experts.I need to read this one again, damn..."
2,"Cynical, Mediocre account of the Captain's life","A decent recapping of the events of the Captain's life, with little real insight, except that the author seems to want to write an expose. At times the criticisms are justified, but more times than not the jabs come off as petty, unsubstantiated, naive or tortuously rationalized from the available material. The glass is always half-empty, even if it takes half-truths to get there. One consistent theme is that Cousteau deliberately deceived the public, an interesting assertion since Munson's source for this is Cousteau's own published writings. The book spends as much time on family squabbles as ocean exploration, as if Kitty Kelly hit the water, pen in hand. There is a fair amount of information here, good if you are a Cousteau fan hungry for a few new tidbits about your hero. Beyond that limited audience the book has little appeal. The writing is competent but uninspired."
1,This game [is bad],"This game totally [is bad]. I played it for 2 ours and it got boring. It is so dumb. I got [into it] because it was the only one in it's genre and it looked cool to fly and a hoverboard. But don't get fooled, ..."
2,not what you would hope for,"I have to admit, when I started the game, it looked really awesome. I kept playing it. I got to the third level and just realized it was not a good game. It is hard and the music is horrible. I would recommend Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 over this any day. I don't think you should get this game. Save your money. The levels are dumb, the graphics are ok, the music and sound is horrible, and the story line is lame. It is just like any other sports game, where you have objectives. The objectives are really dumb. The board doesn't go as high as you would think. It is like a few inches from the ground. I thought I would be able to fly with the character. Doesn't turn out that way. The mobility is not too good. The game seems a bit old, too. I just don't want anyone to be dissappointed the way I am."
3,"Good Gameplay, Bad Music","I think that this game is fun if you enjoy playing Tony Hawk. I mean, it really is like skateboarding, except that the board doesn't have wheels. This game is sort of fun, but not too challenging. It's not a good game to buy if you are a hardcore gamer. If you are one, then I suppose that you should rent it.Anyway, let me tell you that you can do flip tricks on the ground, and that you can't to manuals. But the really weird thing is that you can grab poles and swing around them. The major drawback is the music! They soooo should've took REAL songs and put them in the game, and not these annoying songs that get on your nerves. So, I'm giving it 3 stars!"
2,...,When i saw the adds for airblade i was dazzled. It had Brillinat graphics awesome gameplay i thought i had to get it. I had borrowed it from a friend and then gone to another friends house to play. My friend said it would be a cheap copy of Tony Hawk i didn't believe him though. We started playing good graphics nice storyline impossible mission. The game had good garphics but apart from that it [is no good]. You go like 5cm above ground you have to do tricks and get energy to jump high and gind and the mission are quite corny. The controls [are] pretty much [worthless]. The game trys to get the feel of Tony Hawk with the grinds and tricks but it failed horiibly. I feel pity for the fool how purchases this game. Its terrible abosulute terribel god forbid them making a sequel.
1,Great artist stuck in a soap opera,"If ON BROKEN GLASS is representative of her talents, one wonders what John Gardner could have seen in her work to praise her the way he did (or at least the way Ms. Thorton remembers it). It's easy to understand way Ms. Thorton would want to go through the catharsis of writing this memoir but it is hard to understand why she would want to publish it. In reality, we learn nothing about Gardner we didn't know before but we get a lot of melodrama and self-serving introspection about a person who simply would not be of interest except that the allowed herself to be manipulated by a man, who while a great writer and teacher, crossed the line once too often, taking advantage of his celebrity and status.The details of Gardner's life are not new; Ms. Thorton's story is not much beyond whining and self-loathing, and she does, perhaps, ultimately reveal or imply more about herself and her role in John Gardner's fall than she intends."
2,Love is Blind,"To me, John Gardner was egotistical, self-serving, and liked nothing better than the sound of his own voice. Ms. Thornton was nothing but a doormat, and a doormat who should have known better. Ms Thornton claims writing this book was therapeutic, brought closure, etc. Frankly, I don't think the book served its' purpose. She seems to be the same starry eyed person she was, when John Gardner first appeared on the horizon. And there is no doubt, that Ms. Thornton would have continued on her path of self destruction had John Gardner lived."
2,Far from the trappers bible,"This book is very limited on trapping methods. Snares, box traps and path guards are about it. Nothing on coil spring, conibear traps, etc. Definitely not ""The Trapper's Bible""."
5,Looking out the window at those rabbits,"Ok, so I was looking out the window and watching these rabbits hop by and got to wondering how one would go about catching one. It just seemed like something that one really ought to know, just in case...So I ordered this book and it was exactly what I was looking for. I enjoyed the author's style and practicality. Probably won't ever use this information, but now I think I know exactly how to catch that rabbit if I needed to. Of course it might take me a few trys and that rabbit may be more warry than it looks, but at least I'd know where to start.Now I'll have to find a good book on skinning and cooking rabbits, just in case... ;)"
1,The Trappers Bible,Well to call this book the trappers bible is very misleading. With only a hand full of snares/traps shown (mostly different variations of the spring pole snare) the only new thing I learned from this book was the bow and arrow snare who's field application is practically useless. I'm sorry I bought this book wait of money.
5,Good book!,This is a great book for beginers to intermediate but I would love an experts edition and I believe it needs more detail. Over all a great book!
4,interesting,I thought it would be fun to learn new skills & to teach the kids something useful. It has good instructions & we will try some soon.
3,Interesting bur far from comprehensive. A good primer.,"This book claims to be the bible of trapping but leaves much to be desired. I would expect a ""Bible"" to be much more comprehensive than this handbook in basic, spring loaded traps. It is a good primer for those who have never trapped and may be fun for someone who has a mind to set traps for nuisance squirrels and rabbits but I would not expect to spend this much time and effort to actually run a trap line for daily sustenance. If you want to learn about spring loaded traps this is a good primer. If you want to learn about man traps, punji pits and the kind of exotic man-killing path traps you see in John Wayne's ""The Green Berets"" you can see them here, but I had to wonder why the author thought this was necessary on a book about trapping. Makes me question his grip on reality."
2,Brief overview of trapping,"This book is very short. Using ""Bible"" in the title implies a large, complete, comprehensive volume of information, which this is clearly not. Almost the entire book consists of variations on the spring pole trap with a bit on box traps. For the price and claims made by the author, I expected much more. Information on trap placement, animal habits, bait, or any other directly related topics is thin, at best.If you know absolutely nothing about trapping, this book will get you started, but will not get you far."
4,Trappers Bible,This is a short read @ 72 pages won't take you long. Good to have for practice and reference. Well written and illustrated.
4,Short but good,"Short but good introductory into trapping. Think of this as Trapping 101. Definitely not a complete trappers book but a great place to start. Easy to read, entertaining and informative."
1,Dont buy,"You can google all this for free, dont get me wrong its an informative book but why pay when its free."
1,WHY??,"Why on earth would someone use the Bible in their title? I think I would have liked it better if he said ""Trappers Guide"" or something. It just feels like he is using the Bible's name in vain."
2,"Ok, but could be better","I agree with the review submitted by The Archer. If you are looking for traps and snares that can be set using a limber sampling then there are several types described in the book. However, some of the info seems rather impractical when hiking or in a true survival sitution. I don't see anyone in an emergency situation just happening to have firecrackers, hammers, and nails with them.The book is a starting point. And for that I'll give it two stars."
2,Disappointing.,This book was a disappointment. It only contains a few setups for traps and snares. To call it a bible is a huge overstatement.
5,beginer,this is a very informative book for the low budget beginer like myself. i really liked the book especoa;;y with all the great pictures
1,The Trapper's Bible,"Trapper's Bible is a plain disgrace. Trapping is not sport. It is torture, panic and hideous deaths. This book is trash."
2,Don't buy it,"Very limited info. I would not spend more that $5 on this book. It would be good as an intro to trapping for someone with no prior knowledge of trapping but do not buy is in hopes of learning a lot (very few pages) or if you already know the basics. I also bought ""The Trapper's Bible: The Most Complete Guide on Trapping and Hunting Tips Ever"". Although I can't say it's the most complete guide EVER, it is a much better book, offering a lot more content. I give that book 4 stars as it had a lot of useful info but not a ton that I wasn't already aware of."
3,Its okay,"Its an ok book, but I wouldnt call it a ""bible"". There is only one Bible and it is all inclusive. This is not it."
5,For the price,"I purchased this with the intent to learn more about trapping small game and for what I paid, I'd say I get more than a fair deal. The book shows how easy it is to make traps for edible game, varmits, and even a few camp alarms that could tell you if someone is trespassing on your land."
3,Not Bad,"This book is good, but the tittle is wrong, it's not a bible.Few types os traps, snares & pathguards, only the most common."
4,re,I plan this as an xmas gift. It is imformative and will require some time to learn the trapping skill.
2,games too short and too easy,"""Max and the Haunted Castle"", ""Max and the Secret Formula"", and ""Max and the Pirates""The games were too easy for my 4 1/4 yr old. She finished finding the hidden items (12 socks in the Castle; 7 numbers in the Secret Formula) very quickly and then there was really nothing else (fun/educating) to do. The Max games have the potential to be much more popular with children if Tivola would add more things to do/more stories; make them more difficult/challenging. I gave it 2 stars because it does have potential (my daughter liked Max and his inventor Uncle, Pong). Tivola has a great thing here if they would just improve upon it. ..."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!,"My 3-year-old daughter has discovered the computer recently, so I've been trying to find some inexpensive yet educationally fun software for her. While the price seemed right on this one, that was where the fun ended! Don't waste your money, even if it doesn't seem like much. True, you get 3 games, but they all stink. My daughter doesn't understand anything they say because of their thick accents, and the little movie clips go on FOREVER. By the time she can finally participate, she's totally lost interest. (I don't blame her....yawn!) The games come with absolutely no directions. All in all, these Max games are a waste of money and time. (She loves Dora the Explorer!)"
3,"Fair, no problems","This item worked fine for a small computer that doesn't have this drive. However, don't forget to plug in the adaptor to it when you use it. It did not work without it, just plugged into the computer itself."
1,Ya Get What Ya Pay For,"The old adage ""You get what you pay for"" is true for this product. I bought cheap and that is what I got. Although the unit does function, it is extremely slow. Furthermore during several software installations I noted that if the unit is not accessed constantly it fails. When the application tries to access the DVD after being idle for a short time you get a message that says something like you need to insert the proper disk. This unit is fine for a user that needs it infrequently."
3,Sizing Issue,"Not a bad looking pair of shoes, the square toe is starting to look a little dated. I returned mine the day I got them since they were 1/2 to 1 full size too big."
4,"Great Set, But Doesn't The Price Keeps Changing (Up)?","Enough has been written about the series and the set, so I'm not going to add any more. But am I crazy, or has the price of these sets gone up quite a bit in the last month or two? I bought all seven episodes at Sam's for $47 each about two months ago, but was going to return them after I saw them here (I thought) for about $36 each. I didn't get around to looking again and ordering until a week or so ago, and then they were (here on Amazon) either $45 or $52 depending on the episode. Now they're ALL higher. Just seems odd to me. But a great series (even with some of the campy first series episodes). Leadership doesn't have a much better example than Jean-Luc Picard."
4,"Awesome, fun and nostalgic","I found the first season awesome. It was a little stiled but being a star trek fan, I got a lot out of being able to watch the characters develop as well as the entire acting crew begin to gel into the show. Many of these first few episodes harked back to the original Star Trek, which is a smart move on the writer's part. This show dared to follow the wonderful original, and succeeded immensely. This first seaon is a great kick off to the entire series."
4,STNG !,so nice to have them all in a more compact form. the only compalints are that the titles on the discs are difficult to read AND you have to go back to each one to play - there is no Play All button. Still its worth the effort.
4,Star Trek TNG Season 1,"As a die hard star trek fan, I had to add this, along with the others, to my collection. In terms of digital quality and special features, this is a great investment. The menus are easy to navigate and the picture and sound quality are exceptional. The only drawback is that the characters in the first season were struggling to find their identities. This shouldn't deter you from owning the collection."
3,TNG's shaky season one,"When I first saw TNG seventeen year ago,I was still spoiled by the original series, and thought the show was a mistake to make.Worse was fact that the first episode I saw was the Naked Now,a knock off of TOS' The Naked Time.I really didn't get into TNG until it was shown in re-runs,as it even surpassed the original series in longeviety.The first season was the shakedown.The cast still finding their characters,as well as a handful of okay to bad episodes(The Big Goodbye,11001001,Heart Of Glory were the classic episodes of the season).In all an interesting look at the beginning of a new and now legndary chapter in the Star Trek saga."
3,"Great show, Greedy Studio","Let's be honest, the nearly 100 latinum gold pieces they wanted for these DVD sets was outrageous. And even at the reduced price this is still more costly than most other 6 disc sets out there. Hold on, don't give in to the extortion prices, and eventually DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise sets will come down as well. Great show, but Greedy Studio."
2,Great video but 7.1 audio needs work,"The picture quality is much better than the DVD set but the 7.1 audio is sort of screwed on the Farpoint episodes. I have dialog coming out of both the center and right speakers when it should only be the center. The other episodes seem to be fine so far. Just wondering if I'm the only one experiencing this. All in all a great set!Updated review:After getting further into the disc set, I find all kinds of sync issues as others have experienced. This set is going back until they can release a set that works!"
3,Still no sound effects!,"I am a huge Trekkie and I love ""Encounter at Farpoint"" (along with most of the other TNG episodes). I started watching this 1/2 hour ago before reading reviews - I didn't think I'd need them. Amazon.com..... Where are the sound effects?! It's so weird watching without. I would normally have given this 5 stars, but without the effects, it just doesn't merit it. Not Star Trek's fault... Amazon's issue!Hopefully, episode 2 will be ""all together"". I've never had this issue with streaming from Amazon, nor have I had issues with any other Star Trek episode. Let's get this fixed! Make it so!"
5,Excellent transfer,Finally a worthy version of STNG. I am so glad I did not invest in the lack lustered DVD. This BD set is an excellent transfer and worth the money. I can't wait for ALL the other Star Trek series.
5,STNG in HD,Amazing quality. Makes watching the old shows a new experience. You can pick up all kinds of details never before seen. A must for all true Trekkies.
5,Star Trek The Next Generation - the Complete Season,"Very compelling and entertaining, especially the moral/ethical dilemmas and their resolutions."
4,Blu-Ray Only,"Four stars is not for the shows in the season (and anyone who is interested has already seen the episodes and does not need someone to rate them) - the Blu-Ray make-over gives this first season a definite boost. For all their flaws, I enjoyed watching these episodes again all cleaned up. The graphics are terrific, though I only rate the blu-ray four stars because I don't think they did quite enough: as I was watching these shows, there were always a couple of points at which I thought, 'they could have done more here!' But overall, I am glad Star Trek is finally going to blu-ray. Now, I wish they would get the next seasons out more rapidly. I don't think TNG really gets rolling until season three, but still, I will purchase season two as soon as it is out."
2,Let's be honest - season one was BAD,"Great series, great cast, but let's be honest - the first season was awful. How many of you spot the show on TV, see Riker without his beard and think ""Oh, good, season one!""I am not saying every episode is bad. However, the best of this season would be among the worst of other years. If all you've seen of ST:TNG is season one, don't judge the show by it. Even as early as season two the show really shines, and it gets better and better right up to the end.Buy this if you have to own every episode. Otherwise, be like me and buy every ST:TNG season...except this one."
4,First season is the worst of the series and still better than most TV,"During the first season of The Next Generation, the show was still getting on its feet. In some ways, it resembled the original series in its use of cheesy sets and human-looking ""aliens."" Also, as we all know, Wesley Crusher is annoying. Still, the first season has a few gems like ""Heart of Glory,"" ""The Neutral Zone,"" and, of course, it introduces Q. It's better than most of the garbage that's available on TV. That said, I'd really recommend either just buying the complete TNG DVD set or just watching these episodes on Netflix (now available through online streaming). Or, better yet, wait a bit for the blu-ray version to come out."
3,Fix SFX and put on Blu-Ray version!,"I haven't watched this stream, but now that I see all these reviews about the sound effects, I agree, please fix this and PLEASE PUT ON THE BLU-RAY VERSION! If you do this, I will definitely join Amazon Prime!"
2,poor quality,"Several times during the movie there were no sound effects compared to the original presentation, also the movie had a lot of visually dark scenes especially around the edges of the movie. It's obvious that this was recorded from a VHS tape or a very poor quality DVD. If I had of paid to rent this instead of watching this using my Prime membership I would have asked for a refund."
3,An okay Start to the TNG legend,"Lets face it folks, the First Season of Star Trek the Next Generation is okay at best. It was the first season of a t.v legend with an apperence of Denise Crosby as Tasha Yar, who died late in the season.Even though this season was not the best one there still some season highlights.Encounter At FarpointWhere No One Has Gone BeforeThe BattleThe Big GoodbyeDataLore11001001Hide And QSkin Of EvilHeart Of GloryConspiracyThese epiosodes are pretty good, but the rest is pretty substandard. But I would buy it for the collection."
1,Disc's were messed up,"Had to wait 4 months to get discs without terrible audio, sad and irritating to be completely honest. Would expect more."
2,I got it for completeness sake...,Okay-- in most cases the first season is the worst. (Heroes being a rarity.) With Star Trek: TNG-- it didn't become a consistently watchable show until late in the third season. Don't get me wrong. There are some strong episodes in Season One. Datalore and Conspiracy for instance. But over all-- this season is abysmal.
1,Great season if you want a good laugh.,Two Words: WESLEY CRUSHER. If you want to watch good Star Trek get Deep Space Nine or wait for Voyager. Or forget Star Trek all together and watch Farscape.
5,"Quality here, baby!","OK, so you like ST:TNG, and you really want these DVDs, but you're scared of the price. Especially when you compare it to other Season Box Sets of other TV series. Well, here's the difference. The sound. Most other TV series DVDs are released in their broadcast Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack. However these ST:TNG sets have all been remastered in glorious Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround. Yes that's right. Paramount has done their fans right with these sets and remastered each and every episode in 5.1 Surround. Imagine the amount of work here. 178, IIRC, episodes all remastered in 5.1 Wonderful! Even the more expensive X-Files sets aren't in 5.1. So you're actually getting a bargain here.Looking ahead to next year and the DS9 sets, imagine watching the Dominion War episodes in 5.1 Surround! So without further adue, order this set and the remaining 6 seasons so you can experience the entire series before the end of the year. I have."
2,No sound effects.,"In the very first episode one notices there are no sound effects. It's especially apparent when there's no warning siren and suddenly Picard shouts, ""Someone shut off that damned noise!"" and there's no noise. lol. I'll watch it elsewhere.The lack of sound effects makes it seem very lame and one-dimensional. I had not realized what an important role they played.I do appreciate that they're free with Amazon Prime membership, and if I just have to see them, and can't elsewhere, will come here."
3,Bad audio ruined this experience,"While the visuals are (mostly) stunning, the first time the audio problem happens and you are hearing tinny sound coming out of the theater system, it's a shock and Aw! moment to be sure. I had to play with it for 5 minutes just to get an acceptable sound experience. Very, Very disappointed with the quality control. There are also some ""less than HD"" scenes throughout the set, I guess the original could only be cleaned up so far...EDIT UPDATE: to get replacement discs, you need to be able to see the very, very tiny number on the inside rim of the disc (embedded in the hologram area)...this is very difficult to see and I needed assistance from a younger pair of eyes. This requirement is petty and I believe the manufactuer should provid new discs to anyone with a valid receipt (i.e. forwarded order completion email)... so I guess if you can't read the number (or get it wrong?) you are out of luck (and your purchase price)... For shame!"
5,A classic!,I have been waiting long (too long) for finally having this piece of Star Trek history in my hands.It is a must for every Star Trek fan to own.Do not waste time buy it today
1,Very overpriced dvd,This dvd set is very overpriced for its contents and video quality.. that's what I think..
3,Review of Blu-Ray Version,"The quality of the Blu-Ray is really good, the only thing I didn't like was it's aspect ratio is still not wide screen.... I was under the impression that everything on TV was shot wide screen and then edited for the 4:3 ratio for channels that didn't offer the wider aspect ratio... I guess I was wrong... IMO if you have the DVD version already of Star Trek TNG I wouldn't bother upgrading to Blu-Ray, even tho the picture quality is better, it's not worth the money IMO. Now if the blu-ray had a wide screen aspect ratio then it would be worth the money.... As for content, it's still Cheesy Sci-Fi fun... The last couple seasons were the better ones IMO, the first 2-3 seasons the actors will still molding their characters and their acting came off as robotic and rather cheesy."
2,Episodes just aren't that good,"While The Next Generation, as a whole, does have a handful of great episodes, they are, sadly, the exception rather than the rule. For such a large body of work, the number of episodes that truly engage the viewer, time and time again, are severely lacking. Unlike the original series, which is a completely different animal, most of the episodes of the Next Generation are talky, plodding, void of action/adventure and usually wrap things up in the last few minutes with nonsensical technical double talk. Apparently they're rolling out the entire series on blu-ray. So if you want to own one of the rare gems, you have to buy the entire season, stinkers and all. Hardly a good deal."
3,to recall where no man has recalled before,"the series is amazing, but the only set back is it was released with 3 of the discs being defective which required me to contact the company directly. they said the replacement discs would be shipped by the 10th of August, but i haven't received them yet. it just makes me cautious about pre-ordering future seasons"
5,The Next Generation in Glorious Blu-Ray,"It is a joy to watch Star Trek The Next Generation in the Blu-ray format. The colors are vivid and the special effects have been wonderfully enhanced. I have noticed some graininess in the background on occasion, but overall I am very pleased.I can't wait for the next season to come out, and then on to the Deep Space Nine and Voyager series as well. As a lover of Star Trek since the 60's, when the original show was introduced, I am grateful that the producers of the shows continue to create these Blu-ray editions."
3,Am I crazy? No SFX?,"Just finished watching the pilot and there are no sound effects, however when watching a clip on youtube, all the sound effects are there. It's especially obvious when in the courtroom seen, the bell ringer is just shaking a box to literally no effect. lol, but a bit creepy too.Only 3 stars until it's fixed."
2,No Sound Effects?,"THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF TNG ITSELF, just a comment about Amazon's version. There are no sound effects in the background for some odd reason... no door noises, no ship ""rumble,"" no beeps coming from the console, no red alert siren, etc. How did that even happen?TNG is one of the greatest works of television, but this copy on Amazon Prime needs to be fixed. I guess I shouldn't complain since all the free Star Trek is just a nice bonus on top of my two-day shipping, but if you are going to do something, do it right!And as an additional comment, now that this (and the other two episodes) have been released in HD, will Amazon be allowing viewers to watch the HD versions on prime? :)"
4,"Good Episodes, poor transfer to DVD","I love these episodes. Early as they are, they do show the philosophy that makes TNG different from other Star Trek series in my opinion. For example, Where no one has gone before, a lesson on taking responsibility for our mistakes. No shooting or fighting during the whole episode, I can happily enjoy it together with my 4 yr. old son. Another example, in Lonely among us, Riker and Picard discussing about fights for religion or economic systems and how now it is only in history books. Something to look forward to.I was disappointed however by the quality of the transfer to DVD. Contrast isn't very good at some points and there is noticeable macroblock noise from time to time. The studios should be more careful. All Star Trek series are heavily pirated on the 'net, if the DVD has a poor quality some of the skilled and dedicated rippers out there will filter and clean the images and the pirated versions will look better than the one you can buy..."
2,Even the cast & Mr. R himself hated this one,"It's certainly worth watching for its educational/historical value on how our attitudes on cultural sensitivity in the media have shifted since this episode was created. It's pretty certain this sort of thing would have wound up littering the cutting room floor these days (thank goodness).Jonathan Frakes dubbed this episode a ""worthless piece of ****,"" and Mr. Roddenberry himself was disgusted to the point of firing director Mayberry as a result of this piece.At the same time, racism wasn't the intent of the story; if one manages to sit through it, this one was supposed to be a thought-provoking look at the differences between perceived technical and cultural advancement, and the concepts of ""superiority"" that come out of those concepts. Had the Ligons been cast more diversely, as originally intended, that may have come through. Sadly the message & moral were lost with Mayberry's poor decisions."
3,Coming of Age,"I think it weakens the show when they run two stories in the same episode that never interact, as is the case here. Multiple story threads are fine but they should interact somewhere along the way to establish that there is a purpose for telling both parts at the same time. Neither story is particularly exciting, but it does have some necessary character development."
4,The Last Outpost,"This is a good one. I really like these kinds of stories where the crew find themselves at the mercy of some god-like entity that is older than the human species. It was a great way to introduce a new species, the Ferengi. I'm not all that fond of them in later episodes, but I like how they were introduced."
3,How to make this STTNG S:1 DVD set better..,PLEASE RELEASE THEM IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT....If anyone has a WS or knows where I can buy one ID sell my FS right away..801-361-3230
2,Angel One,"This is Riker at his worst. In the 80s, it was common for lead male actors in action series to have a new love interest every episode (See Knight Rider, Magnum P.I., and others). Riker is the character that does this on ST:TNG, although it's not every episode. Still, watching Riker walk around bare-chested while bedding the leader of the alien world the Enterprise crew were supposed to be negotiating with was tiring."
3,Haven,"There are some interesting ideas here, and Troi's hilarious mother is introduced already in top form. The ending of this story is very poor. Star Trek always attempts to explain in some way the fantastic. However, they don't really offer any ideas for how Wyatt and Ariana have appeared in each others dreams their whole lives. This whole aspect of the episode is essentially a deus ex machina."
3,Lonely Among Us,"My problem with this episode is that the story with the delegates never really interacts with the main story. This makes it feel tacked on, in this case mostly added for comedic relief. TNG is never in short supply of comedy; Data and Worf are fully capable of providing that. The main story is pretty cool, although I wish more had been learned about the strange energy."
2,Code of Honor,"This episode is notorious for being (hilariously) racially insensitive. The people of the alien planet are black, and wear clothing that resembles traditional sub-Saharan African clothing, and behave primitively. The whole story is pretty lame, but it is a nice episode for Tasha Yar."
3,"Not one of the best, but decent",It begins the trend in the first couple seasons of Wesley saving the day far too many times. Patrick Stewart's performance is also one of his worst in this episode. He doesn't seem to be able to play a drunk very well.
5,Kinda dated but classic nonetheless,"It's funny to see how lame the costumes were back in the late '80s (kinda like reliving the old days, haha) but this is a great show. Never got into it back then but it's grown on me since :)"
5,classic,27 years old and STILL awesome!!! brings back so many memories. The 'Next Generation' series discussed so many issues that we would do well to consider today.
4,FINALLY...a price drop!,"Like many Star Trek fans, I've been pretty vocal in my objection to paying over $100 for a single season of ANY t.v. show, including Star Trek. Now it seems my patience has paid off, as Paramount has finally reduced the price (on the first 3 seasons so far) to within range of us poor working-class types.As for the show itself, I've never understood why so many people dislike the first season. Sure, there are a few duds, but that is to be expected from virtually any show. Season one adheres closely to Roddenberry's original vision of space exploration, as well as exploring the many facets of the human condition within a science fiction context. I admit, it's not as fun as the original series, or as mature as DS9, but there's still much to recommend these maiden voyages of the Enterprise-D.Hopefully, Paramount will soon make all season of ALL the Trek shows available at this new lower price."
1,No Sound Effects? Why?,Why are there no sound effects?? Please fix this. You may as well just remove Captain Picard from the videos too. This is just silly.
1,Where are the sound effects!?!?,"There are no sound effects! The dialogue and soundtrack are present, but the sound effects (doors opening, force fields going up, Q appearing and disappearing) are all missing. This seems to be only for the first episode (Encounter at Farpoint). Please fix!"
5,"Loved the series, but...","I had forgotten how much worse the show was when Roddenberry had a major hand in its production. The first few episodes of TNG were cheesy, nearly carbon copies of the original series. With all due respect to Gene, the series improved dramatically, for the most part, when he passed away and no longer had creative control."
2,"Nice idea, but too overpriced.","I like this new trend of putting a whole season out on a few DVDs. I have the 1st season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and just pre-ordered the second, and I'd love to pick this one up too. But [money]??? Buffy's Season Two has almost as many episodes (22 to 25) for less than half the price..."
5,A great gift for anyone,"This is a great DVD gift set of Star Trek : TNG. The packaging is wonderful but it could have been better. The extra features are fantastic. The DVDs are in great crisp picture quality and the sound is in Dolby Digital 5.1 which sounds wonderful. The menu systems are out of the world. It is totally based on LCARS menu system. The only thing missing are the 30 second episode trailers of all the episodes.Now about the content. All the 26 episodes of the first season are provided. Contrary to popular vote, I think that the first season of TNG stands on its own. It has got very good episodes and has one of the best characters of Star Trek, Tasha Yar. Unfortunately, her character dies towards the end which proves to be a blessing for Worf. All in all, it is a must have for all Star Trek fans. It is one of my most prized possesions."
2,"Rent, Don't Buy","Much as I have enjoyed viewing the Season 1 episodes, I would enjoy them more if they looked better. On DVD, many episodes or scenes within episodes suffer from one or more ills: washed out colors, erratic brightness and contrast, distracting digital artifacts. I recommend renting Season 1 (or checking it out at the public library) instead of buying it. Maybe Paramount will remaster Season 1 when the studio prepares it for distrubtion on Blu-Ray. I hope so because at higher resolution, these episodes will look even rougher."
5,A Flashback With Current-times-goggles On!,"This remaster of Star Trek The Next Generation, Season 1 is absolutely amazing! The visuals are stunning on my full 1080p television, the grain of the original film gives it a really theatrical feel as well. The sound is just fantastic also, have it running through my surround sound and it rivals a modern bluray's sound. The new extras are so far really great, especially the one showing the differences between the standard definition tapes of the show and the remastered film and newly done effects that were unable to be upconverted or had no film master of. Can't wait for season 2!Did I say, BUY THIS? DO IT!"
5,STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION(FIRST SEASON),"THE FIRST SEASON OF STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION RATES FIVE STARS.IT HAS A GREAT CAST OF ACTORS AND HAS PLENTY OF ACTION.IF YOU ARE ASTAR TREK FAN OR NOT,I THINK THIS IS VERY GOOD PURCHASE FOR EVERYONE."
1,Bizarre lack of sound effects makes weak episode unwatchable,"I'd forgotten how truly bad the first season was. Between the overly emotional responses, contrived plot and everyone hamming it up, the pilot comes off as a parody of TOS. I'm glad it survived and got better.There are no sounds effects in the Instant Video version-no warp core throbbing, ship rumble, klaxons, door closing, console responses, torpedo sounds, jumping to warp, etc.There is only dialog and the music soundtrack. Where did this version come from?"
3,"What's Here, and What's Not","This is for Trek fans, pure and simple. It is more bang for the buck in that each episode costs about half what DVD's of TOS cost. All the first season episodes are included in the order they were broadcast, plus some cast interviews. This stuff you have seen before, it's recycled from prior TNG specials.What's missing: Video quality sometimes dips for no apparent reason on some special effects shots where a ghost of the ""blue screen"" will appear around the Enterprise. Unlike most every other movie DVD, there is no feature for showing ""cut"" or deleted scenes, or blooper out-takes. This would have really added value for the purchaser and their absence has not gone unnoticed..."
3,Quality as wide and the Q Continuum,"The set runs the gamut from dismal to sublime. But the first episode, ""Encounter at Farpoint"" sticks out most, not because it's the long awaited series to a familiar Star Trek universe, but because it's so abysmally bad - acting, direction, story - embarassing! The lone saving grace is a cameo by De Kelly. Fortunally, the first season successfully recovered and created the groundwork for a brilliant series run, movies and franchise."
2,Pure Filler,"This episode is a lackluster cap on an otherwise phenomenal first season. There's very little conflict, and the people from the 21st century are annoying caricatures. I think the half of the story involving the Romulans was good, but it could have been its own episode."
2,Ugh.,"Tasha Yar was never around long enough to make the death ""emotional"" for me. Denise Crosby was a terrible, stiff actor. And unfortunately for her, Tasha was never developed further as a character. In that sense, there is no attachment here because up to this point her character has been superfluous. Crosby as Sela later on would be better.As for the rest of the episode, the concept of Good vs. Evil was glossed over. Armus never made anyone truly suffer. In the end, this is an episode solely for the purpose of getting rid of Yar. And it did that without being memorable."
1,Hey!! Where's the sound effects?,"This is unwatchable, there are no sound effects at all. Someone gave a similar review 12 months ago! Still not fixed.."
4,Getting started,"I really enjoyed this set. The first season was not as good as the others, but to appriciate the next six seasons you need to see the beginning. The behind the scenes stuff is worth watching also."
2,Vintage cheese,"If you're wondering why you've never caught this episode on repeats, I suspect it's because they're embarrassed to replay it. The writing and acting is on par with the original Star Trek series which, if you're a dyed-in-the-wool trekkie (like I am), makes this episode at least fun - if horribly painful - to watch. At least it's one more notch toward your ""I've watched them all"" achievement badge.With so much fine, vintage cheese as you'll find here, I'd recommend a good wine. Perhaps a nice Mont-Redon Chteauneuf-du-Pape."
2,Good Show...,Currently not compatible with Windows 8 - minus 1 starNo sound effects - minus 2 starsGood start to an amazing series.
4,Heart of Glory,The description of this episode is a little misleading. But it's an excellent episode with some great insight into Worf. Definitely one of the better ones of Season 1.
3,Home Soil,"I like when the show involves really mysterious forms of live that are completely different from the usual Ferengi, Klingons, etc... The bit of mystery at the beginning is nice as well."
3,original 4:3 aspect ratio? How can i make it Wide,"Original 4:3 aspect ratio?? I am not sure if this is correct, but someone please chime in and help this newbee. I recently purchased this TNG season 1 Blue ray and was wondering why the episodes are showing on my screen cropped (Black spot on both side)? I have all the TNG seasons on DVD and I can watch it in full screen. I am playing the BR discs on my PS3, latest sw update I believe. I checked all my settings for screen resolution and still nothing! Does anybody else have this issue? Please advice!Thank YouR/NavyLaser"
2,where are the sound effects,"I was very excited to watch this with my 12 year old son, who has never seen it, and even he asked ""where are the sound effects?"". This is a total rookie mistake. Upon reading the reviews I notice this problem has existed for well over a year and it still isn't fixed? What the heck?! I really don't get this at all."
2,Shut off WHAT damn noise?,"I was really looking forward to watching STTNG on Amazon Prime video, now on X-Box, but something wasn't right. When it got to the first scuffle and Picard said, ""Shut off that damn noise!"", I had to rewind it to see if I missed it myself. There are no sound effects. Are THESE now a victim of music royalties? Fix this Amazon."
5,Perfect for the times,"How perfect in this day and age for this collection to be released. With most of the world following a low intelligence, racist, beer drinking, war loving and seeking, extreme religion following fevor, this series will bring light to our ignorance. Sure you can see this on TNN all edited and overcompressed. How wonderful to see these gems in full dvd quality. This series shows us how uncivilized we are today and what we can strive to be in the future. If Captain Picard were our president, imagine how wonderful and peaceful this world would be today."
3,The Amazon Prime Directive malfunction,"Signed up for Amazon Prime *because* of the BD version of StarTrek:TNG. Though I click on the HD version, I still get the 480p version. Not cool, Prime, not cool. The Prime Directive malfunctions."
1,video does not stream!,amazon please fix your star trek the next generation videos this is the second one i've tried to watch that had errors. this one doesn't even attempt to play
4,Better than New,"only gets 4 stars because of the 4:3 aspect ration display it is presented in. Otherwise overall quality is significantly better than the DvD. As for the content if your not a treky, you wont get it. I dont know why people hate on the first season, ya it didnt have any overall theme as the later seasons, but it was the first and still awesome."
2,First season painful to watch,"I own the other six years of the series, but not this one. Most of the acting is painful and awkward, the pacing too slow, Troi's costumes are embarrassing, Worf looks silly and Tasha Yar hands down is the worst actress imaginable - how did she ever get the part?"
2,orchestration instead of music,"These tone poems are fine examples of German late romantic orchestral noodling. Sadly, in spite of much dramatic gesturing, no memorable themes ever appear. As a conductor, Boehe was important in establishing the orchestra that has since become the Staatsphilharmonie der Rheinland-Pfalz. As a composer, though, he is indifferent, of interest only to the ""twentieth-century German music"" completist, or perhaps to someone with sentimental ties to Ludwigshafen am Rhein(!). The performance is good, at least!"
2,the delivering quaterback,"This is a book that can eb interesting to people who enjoy George Plimpton's writing. Ii enjoyed the book that i read before. The Mysterious Case of Sidd Finch, but I did not like the Paper Lion. Thi book is too slow for my liking and it didn't keep me very interested. Plimpton is a great writer but this one kind of bombed to me. The book starts out very slow. George Plimopton is going undercover as a backup quarterback, third strign that is. He goes and plays for the Detroit Lions. Not the greatest pick if i say so. The ciach of the lions was George Wilson, no not the neighbor form Dennis the Menace. The story is mainly duriing the preseason. Plimpton howeer does take snaps, and doew get his fair share of bruises and cuts. Like i said earlier, PLimpton needed to put a little bit more of action into the story."
5,A compassionate view of a mistreated Goddess,"Books such as When God was a Woman"" by Merlin Stone or ""The Language of the Goddess"" by Marija Gimbutas reframe the role and signifigance of the Goddess in the evolution of religion. ""The Rotting Goddess"" continues in this vein to explore Hecate as an example of the treatment of the Goddess in the civilizations of classical antiquity. Parallell to the ancient debasement of the Goddess is the emergence of the Witch--her priestess. While Rabinowitz' writing can be challenging, as all classical scholarship is; the book is well worth navigating for its compassionate treatment of an abused Goddess. The book is a worthy addition to contemporary explorations of the ancient Goddess religions."
5,Love Eucerin,"Eucerin has great products! I love this face wash because it deeply cleans the skin and leaves no residue on your face. You can clean up all your make-up with one wash. This product is hard to find in the store, I'm glad Amazon has it."
1,Disappointed,I am disappointed with the product despite reading how good it is... It contain sodium lauryl sulfate which not only create the rich lathering foam but it also take away the moisture from the top layers of the skin. I have very sensitive skin with frequent outbreaks of pimple and this product make it worse!!!
5,An absolutely stunning performance,"I am a music lover, not a professional musicologist, but since no one has yet reviewed either of Ottavio Dantone's two stunning CDs of Vivaldi's L'Estro Armonico Op. 3, I feel I have to jump in because they are so incredibly, unbelievably good. These recordings of his violin concertos are simply wonderful, and in many ways a revelation: in them, Vivaldi succeeds in rising to Bach-like heights.Sorry for the gushing, but if you compare these CDs with other performers' often rather dull recordings of the same music you will see what I mean. And the clarity of the sound is superlative too."
5,The Generosity Factor,"This book has the potential to change the world as we know it by changing how we treat each other. I loved it, and my entire company is now dedicated to changing the world by doing the right thing."
3,s,"I would have preferred something on this topic written more as a memoir rather than a parable. The format oversimplified a concept which is profound. I bought this book looking for something to reaffirm ideas of charity to myself. As it was, the format was a bit irritating and I didn't get as much from it as I would have otherwise. As it turns out, some of the author's political beliefs seem decidedly narrow and exclusionary, but this is not information I knew when I ordered the book, nor did it affect my response to it."
4,Good buy!,It didn't take long to arrive and came in mint condition. Also the game's pretty good so was worth the postage cost.
4,"A great game, believe it!!!","If you like Naruto, this is the game for you! It has all your favorite characters from the show including Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi and more. I really enjoyed the game and couldn't put it down. The game play is similar to that of the Dragon ball Z Budokai series, it is a traditonal fighter with no special twists (the first person to knock out all of your opponent's health gauge out wins, a chakra gauge fills up to use your special techniques.)Overall:Characters: 3/5 Characters are pretty balanced aside from some hidden unlockable charactersGame play: 4/5 Pretty well done, but it doesn't offer anything that any other fighter doesn'tLasting appeal: 2/5 The game is rather short, I beat the game in about 2 monthsOverall:3 1/2"
2,This is more of a collectors item for fans than a master peice game.,"Many people are fans of the anime show Naruto, but this game is a let down to the television show. The graphics aren't that bad, though. It gives the look and feel of the anime. If only it can give the length of the anime, also. The sound is okay, but the characters end up repeating the same lines every time and it gets irritating. It's overall value isn't long. It contains half the modes a standard fighter has and nothing new. The story mode is short. The gameplay is good and filled with action, it's just that you will be sitting down playing the same short and lacking modes. Did I mention there were only 10 characters?To sum it up, if you are a die hard fan you will get this, but you will have a bitter taste in your mouth playing it.Pros: Nice cel shaded anime look and feel ; Good gameplayCons : Shortage of modes and characters ; story is very short."
4,fit perfectly with straps,"If you do not have straps with fasteners, I would advise purchasing some with this item. It does not fit snugly on its own even though it has one strap in the middle."
3,It is very hard to tie on,It does not conform to the ironing board and go on easily. The drawstring is difficult to manage. Maybe it will be better when broken in.
2,Nu Tone Ironing board cover,The cover was not made like the old one and it was too small to fit the board correctly. Not satisified with this product. I would not order this again.
1,not for me,Weird book. I bought it just bc it was Maeve Binchy and I had never heard of it. It's a weird book kinda random groupings of writings and drawings. Wouldn't have bought it had I seen it in person. The books not bad it's just not a traditional Binchy book.
3,The Perfect Gift for a Friend in the Hospital,"Need to visit a friend facing surgery but don't know what to take him/her? Maeve Binchy has the perfect little pick-me-up. A humorous 99-page volume of witty dos and don'ts for patients and visitors alike will bring a smile to recuperating faces. Learn how to annoy the patient in the next bed, how to have friends and family attend to your every whim, how to cope with hospital food, and much more.Fans of Maeve will also be treated to insights into this wonderful author's life---her bare-all experience in a nudist colony, her childhood fears, her own hip replacement surgery."
4,aches and pains,I was surprised to find something different from Maeve Binchey. It made me laugh and smile so much that I immediately ordered it for my mother. This is not Binchey's usual insightful and soothing novel or shortstory but a dark and wry sort of how to book about injury and illness. She tells you how to do grin and do it with style.
1,You'll only ever need this machine.,"My mother had a sumeet, as did her mother. The blenders have done my family good for many years, and all the sumeets in my family are still currently in use, all these years later. I just bought my first one in Jackson Heights (in Queens, NY) for $150. Best money I've ever spent. The Asia Grinding Jar reduced my cocoanut to a fine powder that was like the freshly fallen snow. The Spice Grinder Jar took my toasted coriander seeds to an ultra fine powder. The tall, traditional jar made quick work of a whole lot of ice, and brought forth a cool, slushy beverage. It's worth ever penny.UPDATE: The grinder died on me in 3 months. I sent it in to get repaired. Don't do this. I haven't heard from them since."
1,Do not buy this product,I had the worst experience with this product. Within the first use the rubber parts that connect the jars to the machine came off in peices. This happenned multiple times on multiple jars. Each time I use it I also get the smell of burning rubber. Since this is within the warranty period I am returning the product.
1,Wast of Money,"We bought this last year with one year warranty, after couple uses the rubber parts and brockets are broken. We have reported and sent pictures of broken spares to dealer. We have been waiting for the spares last 7 months. It is sitting in the kitchen as show piece."
4,"It works well, but it hard to adjust","This ligature is designed to change the tone of the clarinet. If rocked one way, the clarinet is more open and brighter, the other way it is darker more soulful. The problem is that it is not that easy to adjuster. Since this ligature is for a Eb soprano (sopranino) clarinet, this type of ligature may work better on a Bb clarinent. (Just a side note - Bb ligature is a different size)."
1,Mosquitoman,Disc came very fast... This was a prerelease disc with not for sale or rental every 10 minutes the screen went to black and whit and stated not for sale... Im sur seller didnt know this was not a prerelease demo type dvd... But we got stuck with a disc thats not worth watching.
2,Mosquito Man,"it an ok movie. its one of those you would see at the outdoor movie at about 4 in the morning or on the late late late show on TV on the weekend after the ""Godzilla"" double feature. effects were better them adverage in some parts worse in others. i think there were missed oppertunities for more human drama and transformation. glad i didnt have to pay full price."
3,What We Need Here Is a Big Ass Can of Off!!!,"Oh, those bugs! Does anyone have a flyswatter? Well, you'll need a really big one. Chemicals turn a scientist into a big bug, feeding on human blood. What gore! Buckets of Blood, loads of cheese!!! Everything you need for a routine nature run amok yarn. Worth owning, mainly because of the special effects. Sitcom icon Corky Nemic (Parker Lewis Can't Lose) is well, miscast as a police officer investigating the bee-zar murders. Still, lots of fun."
3,Worthy of a showing or two,"Mosquito man was a average movie but with a great mosquito costume.99% of the mosquito man scenes are great, and only 1 scene where youthe mosquito costume revealed too much.Now if they would have invested in a better script this movie couldhave been a 4 star movie.The non-action scenes because of boring ' deja vu stuff' almost kills this movie...i dont know who to blame ...the actors or thedirection. Also the music was not too bad,, but better music mighthave brought this film to a 3.5.There is enough gore for the horror fan to enjoy."
2,"Do not buy, especially for $22","This movie at best is a $10 movie, it took me 2 days to watch this crappy movie. The effects suck they are all animated and look nothing real, not a tad real and are quit stupid. May I request a rent first, which when is done you willmost likely say"" Thank god i didnt listen to the review Russ gave"" $22 is a complete waste. Uless you just have $22 TO WASTE then yes buy it.You want to see a good movie which is very similar, which Mosquito man has actually bit off of , in a sense. Go out and get the fly the one made in the 80's, featuring Jeff Goldbloom and Gina Davis. Just an awesome movie"
4,Interesting sci-fi- a must see!!,"This movie is very fun!! I'd read some iffy reviews - this is NOT the case!!! Give this show a chance; it's very fun to see Corin Nemec in a 'serious' role again, and the rest of the cast lives up to their parts. I'm very happy with the time it took to recieve this 'gem', and the condition was exactly what I was expecting. Mosquito Man is definitely a go!! Do yourself a favor and watch watch watch!!!!!"
1,Poor sound quality,"I purchased this phone for my mother who has severe deafness. She has a corded phone that works very well for her, but I wanted her to have a cordless phone. This is NOT it. The sound quality is very poor! She can't hear on it at all, the volume control is not much louder than what you would find on the volume control phones at WalMart. Several other family members tried to use it, but it makes voices sound mechanical & distorted. There is no bass at all in what you are hearing. We were very disappointed and will send it back ASAP!"
1,Not Going To Try For A Third Time!,"Got two. The first one NEVER worked. The second had extremely poor, tinny sound and failed entirely after only 3 days. Caveat emptor!"
1,Poor Handset ringer volume,Everything is good with this phone except for the handset ringer volume. I have good hearing but I can hardly hear the handset ringer. So my mother-in-law with a hearing impairment cannot hear it at all.Technical support at Clarity don't know how the handset ringer works.Unfortunate for a cordless phone designed for hearing impairment needs that you can't hear the handset ringer.
2,Functional but poor clarity at loud volumes,"I purchased this phone for my father who has difficulty hearing on a regulartelephone. Although the volume is loud, any background noise is very disturbing while talking on this phone. The phone has three tone settings along with volume control. At higher volumes, the tone settings really don't make any difference because he still can't hear because of poor voice quality. This phone is supposed to be hearing aid compatible, my father can here on this phone better without his hearing aid and on a much lower volume than the phone is capable. Hopefully there will be a learning curve associated with using this phone, but for now, it is not worth the money. My expectations were that he would be able to pick up the phone, make a few adjustments, and easily be able to have a normal conversation without a lot of effort. It is just not there yet. It has been about a month maybe time will tell."
4,This phone delivers,"I bought this phone for my elderly mother, who is quite hard of hearing. She never has to ask anyone to repeat what they said. She can hear just fine while on this phone. The volume is very loud (which is great for her), but just about blows my eardrum out when I forget to turn it down before I use it. The ringer is quite loud also, which is great. And it has differnt ring tones to chose from to make it easier to hear, depending on your level of hearing loss. For the money, I think it's a great value."
1,"Beware of the ""blend""","These sheets are horrible! The ""blend of cotton & polyester"" is 75% polyester and 25% cotton. They feel like nylon mesh! I wouldn't make my toddler sleep on these. I returned the set I purchased."
2,A Pain in the Patootie,"We bought it thinking it'd be cute for the kids.Well, it is cute. At first. Then you realize that some rule-loving capo must've designed it. It's a maddening game. You get hardly any direction at all, which would be cool if you didn't get stuck. And remain stuck because you have no idea what the next step is.The kids like the mini games but the actual adventure? Such as looking for all the charms in a scene? Drove them crazy. They ended up abandoning the game.I peeked for cheats online, but it seems like most users get sick of this game. Such an unfriendly one. : ("
3,Mildly positive,"Got it for my 5-1/2 year old son. He likes it a lot, but has trouble with some of the controls and seems to be stuck perpetually on level 1. Also, does not have 1080p High Def output but still looks great on the screen."
2,Stuck on level one,"I have spent several hours on this game. The hugest defect is you cannot save the game when you want. I am stuck on level 1 (""training!""). After having collected about 20 amulets, a message says ""now go find your brother Emile"". No way I could find that rat. And all the times I want to try, I have to start everything from the beginning. And I am forced to watch again all the instructions videos, as you cannot skip those! Unbelievable. And it's true: all the walkthroughs on the internet are completely useless, because the PS3 game is completely different from the other platforms. It's a pity, because they put a lot of work on this game which potentially would be very nice.-- Edit:I have now dedicated more time to the game. I'm still convinced there are several issues, but I must say that all in all it is not bad. It is rather fun to play and probably it is worth trying. Although they say 3+, forget having it played by kids 4-5 years old. It is just too hard."
2,Broken CD,The book was written in (all of the answers were marked) and the disc that came with the book was broken when it arrived in the mail.
3,Having a tough time,"I hate it when people write about places they know nothing about. I am having a VERY hard time even beginning this book. SOUTHERN TENNESSEE? Just where IS that? Tennessee is THREE GRAND DIVISIONS...West, Middle, and East. I THINK this book is taking place in the east...and perhaps SOUTHeast...but Lori really needed to do a bit more research on the area. I am not even sure I want to finish the book but I will just to give it a fair shot."
2,Unless you have the time.....,"If you have about an hour and a half to waste each time you want to play a game, then you may want to get Quarterback Club 2000. I couldn't believe how slow the game took to play, even on accelerated or turbo mode. Additionally, little things like always getting called for delay of game penalties after touchdowns and the fact that it was impossible to kick field goals made this game extremely frustrating. But, the graphics are very good, and the player and team set-ups are fun which make this game tolerable, but I would definitely recommend renting this game before you buy it."
1,Not a passing fancy,This is the worst football game I have ever played. Unfortunately I had to buy it to find out. I still think Tecmo and especially Super Tecmo Bowl were games ahead of their time. This game makes it impossible to complete a forward pass. It seems as though you need an extra hand to be able to press all the buttons they want you to press at the same time to try a pass. Nintendo would be best suited to create a Tecmo 2000.
4,Just a reference to the People who say it's slow.,"This game was designed for use with the memory expansion pak. You know that cover on the top of your N64 that says, ""Memory Pak,"" with the new expansion pak, this game is just as fast as 98 was. This game probably would not be any fun without the expansion pak, so anyone that's shopping and doesn't yet have an expansion pak, it would be a great idea to look into one."
3,Tilda Swinton ruined this one..,"BBC stop being cheap and make a David Attenborough version please..I can barely bare hearing this womens voice through this video, despite the amazing events and video footage there wasn't anything particularly breath taking or mind boggling like I was hoping for..if you don't know who Tilda Swinton is she's the white witch from The Chronicles of Narnia..as if enough wasn't said just in that, beware because you will feel like your listening to someone telling you fairy tales and bedtime stories the entire time..*sigh* please BBC from now on only use David Attenborough for future Earth series releases, Tilda was just an overall bad choice to use for this video..and don't even get me started about using Oprah for the Life series.."
3,Just O.K.,"Note: This review is for the blu-ray format only.Pro: Beautiful cinematography provides access to the Galapagos otherwise not available to tourists. Recommended for that reason alone. Very high-quality blu-ray video.Con: 1) The script is written as if the viewer hasn't seen previous episodes so there is quite a lot of repetition. If I ever hear reference to the ""island conveyor belt"" again it will be too soon. 2) I have nothing against Tilda Swinton, but the narration came across as either flat or left me feeling like I was in kindergarten. I found it tiresome. 3) As the series progresses it becomes one long sales pitch for evolution theory. While the evidence found in the Galapagos does present a logical argument for adaptation, I found the Darwinist ""and the world was changed forever"" drumbeat tedious.Conclusion: Worth watching. Too bad it doesn't come with a music-only track."
4,Beautiful - great value,"A must for anyone planning a trip to Galapagos or those wanting a clear understanding of this unique part of the world. Video stunningly crisp and beautiful. I expected more on Charles Darwin, alas, will have to search elsewhere."
5,Galapagos [Blu-ray] from Amazon,One of the best nature documentaries I've seen. I saw part of it on broadcast tv and decided I wanted to own it. Am watching it on a 60 inch screen and it is amazing.
4,Galapagos,"Amazing photography. Spectacular color. Watching it on our new 58"" plasma tv, in blu-ray..... Well it just doesn't get any better. Well worth the investment!"
5,Visual Perfection,"This is a fantastic film, absolutely visually stunning with beautiful crisp video.This is a great example of what can be accomplished with HD-DVD. Even if you're not a nature film buff, this set will impress you."
4,Caution: Amazon is shipping wrong region on this DVD,"I've purchased this DVD twice in the last 8 months and both times received a DVD encoded for region 2 that would not load on my HD DVD players here in Oregon. Amazon custoemr service notes say ""plays in all regions"" -but I'm 0 for 2 tries on 2 differnt HD dvd players.The material is fabulous - but they gave me a refund in lieu of the desired region DVD."
5,Entertaining,"This DVD is heavy on the theory of evolution, mentioning it countless of times throughout the film. Unsurprisingly, there is an episode about Darwin in Galapagos in the video. Regardless, the movie captured many wonderful creatures in the island and the origin of the islands itself. It's very interesting to see that Galapagos has both brutal and lush landscapes and both are habitats of unique creatures many of which are found nowhere else. Fascinating video. Highly recommended!"
5,Wonderful movie,"Stunning video of all the flora and fauna of the Galapagos, as well as interesting information on the forces that formed the islands as well as their weather and geology. Both entertaining and educational."
5,1st and 3rd episodes are better,"I really enjoyed watching it, the 1st and 3rd episodes dive into the Galapagos in a way I've never imagined. The 2nd episode highlights Darwin, but to me it didn't really enhance the DVD...But it was a great watch"
5,Collectible in its own way,"If you got an old HD-DVD player, this is one DVD you have to have in your collection. The Planet Earth HD-DVD is also a must."
2,No way,"I thought this documentary was incredibly lacking. It makes the Galapagos seem pretty boring. I'm heading there next month and I hope to see much more than what is shown here! ...BBC usually puts out incredible work, but I found this documentary focused too much on the whole ""Darwin Experience"" and not enough of the modern experience. Would have loved to see more DETAILED footage on the wildlife as BBC usually does."
3,Beautiful but not Perfect,"AS some other reviewers have noted this is not full HD. In fact it goes beyond the fact that it is 1080i, but to the point that some scenes were simply not filmed in high resolution or atleast were not transfered onto this DVD. This was confirmed on the DVD box which actually stated this.As i was watching some scenes are just absoultely stunning, particularly the closeups. However some slow motion scenes from long distances seemed less sharp and even occasionally jittery. Minor, but distracting compared to the othere scenes of high quality.Overall its Good. I dont regret buying it but i do wish it were full HD."
4,Not full HD,"Not full HD only 1080i - but looks great nevertheless. In fact I'd say it looks crisper than some of my full HD titles. I don't think Tilda Swinton has the right sort of voice for it, but it's only a minor gripe. Where was David Attenborough that day?"
5,Beautiful,"This is the epitome of what a nature series should be. The images were amazing, as good as one could hope for without being there. This was a first class production from top to bottom. It keeps you locked in with fascinating facts and well delivered narration. Inserting in very well timed and produced re enactments only adds to the production value."
5,Breathtaking Visuals,"I watched the HD version and it provided visuals so real I almost reached out a few times at my laptop. You can see the love of the editors immediately that went into choosing just the right clip, I actually said 'wow' out loud a few times. The music was very well done too, it stayed soft and in the background most of the time but would swell epically during key events. One piece was so pretty and haunting that I'm am desperately googling to find out if its available.For those that heard Tom Hiddleston narrated, it is not what you think. He narrates for a young Charles Darwin and has maybe a minute of speaking time in the first episode and maybe two minutes in the second episode. It was enough of a taste to wish for future full length narrations from him. The majority of this is narrated by Tilda Swinton who gave a wonderful performance. Her voice is strong and powerful in describing the life and death events on these islands."
3,review for Galapagos,"This DVD had beautiful photography and covered all of the bases regarding this island chain, and the role it played as the basis for evolution. One disappointment was that this is not one single documentary, it is a series of three separate segments. At the beginning of each, there is a similar overview of the islands, their geological history, and recreations of Darwin pondering the wildlife there. The introductions even share some of the same shots, such as the same tortise yawning. I wish this DVD could have been one single documentary without the redundancy, and I wish it could have extended beyond the basics, but otherwise it was nice."
4,Great Photography - Not to exciting,I loved the photography in this disk but I have seen other nature presentations that were more exciting and interesting. The Blu-Ray presentation looked great --
3,Could have been better,"The photography is excellent. The program not so much. There was not a lot of information or depth of study, it was more of a quick overview. I found the narrating dull and monotonous. Overall it was good, not great. The photography makes up for the lack of information."
5,awesome for adults and teens,my 14 going on 15 year old son was as intriqued as I was. Fascinating and beautiful
5,Must see,This video is outstanding.I can't think of anything to add that hasn't been said in the previous reviews.Someday I hope to vacation there for sure.
4,Great DVD,"Not BluRay but still awesome video. Kinda dissapointed that the sound is only 2 channelThe reason I buy BluRay is I have a 6.2 channel sound system and want to take advantage of it. I know about 90% of the people that have flat screen TV's use the TV's sound system, but it's still pretty cheap that the BBC didn't re-mix this in surround sound. I have Planet Earth from the same BBC folks and that plays in 5.1 sound and is freaking awesome!"
5,Great Nature Documentary : Beautiful Scenes & Exotic Wildlife,"Galapagos may not be as stunning as Planet Earth, but that doesn't mean it's not a great nature film with beautiful scenes and exotic wildlife. If you are not familiar with the Islands featured in the film, than you will enjoy learning about them and why they are historically important. The cinematography is well done, and the narrator has a pleasant voice that doesn't stand out from the film (as it shouldn't). The three scenes are about 50 minutes each, and the focus is primarily on the formation and life cycle of the islands and the wildlife that call them home. There are great shots of animals under the water as we've come to expect, and the music to some of these is enjoyable. If you enjoy nature and great cinematography, you will enjoy Galapagos."
4,Visually stunning!,"I can understand why electronics stores use this as a visual to sell their TVs. The transfer on blu-ray is fantastic! The contrasts are very sharp. The clarity of pictures is vivid. It truly feels like you're actually seeing these things in person. Of all of the nature documentaries I've seen on blu-ray, THIS is the one I use to demo my blu-ray player/TV to my friends and family.As for the video, it's in 2.0, so I wouldn't expect mind-blowing sound. However, I do really enjoy Tilda Swinton as narrator.Very, very good."
5,Great video for biology class,"This video is great for a high school biology class. The quality of production is great and the narration is clear and slow enough for students to understand. Unlike other videos like standard deviants, which rely on theatrics and nonsense to keep the students attention this video is all fact, and still interesting. I hope they keep making documentaries of this caliber."
2,Could have been better!,"Although the photography is great,the program is more of an overview of the Islands than an indepth study that it should have been,but I can recommend it! Although Darwin and the Galapagos will forever be linked,his evolution theory should be considered historical in its context,not presented to be factual."
3,Won't play on all DVD players,"Although I have no doubts that the content is excellent, I was unable to play it on my DVD player. It requires an HD DVD player. It will not play on a traditional DVD player unless you can update your firmware. I don't believe it will play on a Blue Ray disk player either. I tried it on video game systems as well as my new laptop, but was unable to get it to work. I plan to reorder this item in regular DVD format."
3,ok Blu-ray DVD,This Blu-ray DVD is good quality. But it is not worth so much more than DVD. It is just like watching the Discovery Channel. No surprises.
1,poor customer service/response,"I ordered the Galapagos DVD, but I received the Galpagos DVD case with another DVD inside. MJ asked me to return it on my own nickel to be later reimbursed. This is more trouble than it's worth and I asked for a full refund but am yet to hear back from MJ."
3,Beautiful,This is one of the most beautiful documentaries I have seen. I just wish they could have left the religion (Evolution) out of it.
5,fascinating,"Learned a lot we didn't know, giving us more of a feel for how people first thought of the Galapagos, including Darwin. Great videography!"
1,Ick!,"If I could give it less that one star I would. This was the biggest disapointment. After reading so many great reviews I bought it and couldn't wait to sell it.The mixing is terrible, like tiny little train wrecks. The track selection is boring, and it energy (what little there is) goes no where. I have to assume that the reviews before this came from friends of this Julian Marsh dj who obviously needs to go back to DJ101."
3,"Fun, but Gameboy not the best vehicle for this game.","While there is no denying the staying power of this addictive game, I didn't think gameboy was the best vehicle for it. The game is best played with joystick and the small screen and controls don't quite do Ms. Pacman justice. Great way to pass the time in airports but the old arcade version is still much more fun to play."
4,It is OK,"This game is ok, but it can get boring because it is the same maze thing. becides that I guss it is ok,"
4,This book was so fun!,"I thought this book was so funny in a dark-humor way. J.N. Williamson never lets you get bored and is always a page turner in every book I've read of his. This book is my favorite of his. The main character is a crack-up. His dripping eyeball is such a good character trait. The scary part is, I think there are people out there like Dell (main character). Anyway, this book is a nice entertaining book. Not a masterpiece, but a lot of fun and adventurous! His books move a lot faster than Stephen king."
1,Disproves Darwin,"This is none too memorable. It may appeal to people who have no familiarity with the avant-garde cinema of the '10s through the '70s, but to compare this with the work of Man Ray or Oskar Fischinger is to find a reason to get mightily depressed. The Kino Video release ""Avant-Garde: Experimental Cinema of the 1920s and '30s"" is a good place to make the acquaintance of the true creative potentialities of the medium."
2,dull,"i felt i wasted my money here. i recommend Richard Kern movies over Zedds. the film quality was fine and the extras etc reasonable. its just that the films were generally plainly boring! Also a thing I like about Kern's work is that the soundtracks by J Thirwell are quite good. Here the soundtracks didn't add anything. I admit there were a few humourous bits on this DVD, and some scenes that may shock normal people (but didn't do it for me), but I was kept wanting to find something..."
1,A Wee Much,"The problem with Joyce Carol Oates' collection Haunted: Tales of the Grotesque is not so much banal characterization and transparent plot as it is the inclusion of the germs of several good stories of innately horrifying human experience into a compilation that reeks genre fiction. An abortion is bad enough without setting it, a la Atwood, in ""the second year of The Edict."" Baby-boiling is bad enough without 117 ""becauses."" That, and the urge to make margin notes and return the manuscript saying, ""Promising first draft, but way over the top.""In the best piece in the collection-the Afterword-Oates says, ""One criterion for horror fiction is that we are compelled to read it swiftly, with a rising sense of dread..."" Yes'm, swiftly and only once."
1,"If you hate men, read this book",Every story in this collection goes back to a woman hurt by a man and her reacting with violent retribution. I was sorely dissapointed.
2,Pac-Man is Difficult to Play on GameBoy,"I found this game very difficult to play on GameBoy due to the setup of the GameBoy controller, and the size of the screen. The pac-man does not maneuver very easily with the X-style controller. Also, the screen does not show the entire maze, and must pan as you maneuver. This becomes confusing, especially when trying to plan a strategy. I would not recommend this game for GameBoy."
4,The king of all video games,"I remember being absolutely fascinated with Pac-Man when it first came out. It was truly groundbreaking and I had to get it when I bought my Game Boy Color. As others have said, it is a little hard to control with the Game Boy pad thing and not the joystick and I have lost several lives because of that difficulty. Also, others here have complained that the maze doesn't change at all but I'm 99.9-100% sure that it never changed at all in the original arcade version. It was Ms. Pac-Man that introduced changing mazes."
3,Quite enjoyable,"I'm an old timer who remembers the original PacMan. This is quite enjoyable, but as another reviewer has said, it is quite difficult to play on the game boy. Fun for idle moments, though.I much prefer the PacMan world game on PlayStation - far more challenging and very simple to play. END"
3,Difficult on the Game Boy,"I have always played Pac Man with two hands. One hand for movements to the right, and the other hand for movements to the left. Either hand for up or down.On the Game Boy, you can only navigate with one hand (the thumb) in all directions. It is very difficult, especially for players who are used to the arcade, joystick, or even computer version. Like a person above stated, I miss a lot of moves because of this. I'm getting better though."
5,Great Book For M*A*S*H Lovers!,"Jamie Farr does a great job of bringing the reader into all aspects of his life, not just the MASH years but throughout. It makes the reader really feel a part of the highs and lows of a man trying to obtain his dream of acting. Great insights and accounts of his years as MAX KLINGER on M*A*S*H 4077. A MUST HAVE - MUST READ for any MASH FAN!"
3,This game is so-so.,"NBA Showtime is so-so. The bad things are that you only get to play with two players on each team. Second, you can't choose from the whole team. Last, the graphics are pretty bad. The good things are that the controls are easy to remember, and when you forgot the password to your latest season or playoffs it is there for you and you just have to copy it over."
1,This game is stupid!,"If you want a basketball game, try a different one! This is the worst!The graphics suck, its too hard, and the rveiws are all messed!"
2,I wouldn't recommend it,"This is a pretty bad basketball game with a lot of flaws. You only have two people per team (which really stinks.) Secondly, the graphics are pretty bad, even for Gameboy Color (you want good graphics, look at the Zelda games for GBC!) And what's really annoying is the fact that you can't save, there's only passwords! I mean, by now, all GB cartridges should be able to save! My tip: look for a better B-ball game."
5,Coolest Basketball Game!,"If you love NBA Jam then you will love this game, as well. There are cool moves and gravity-defying dunks as well as the ""ON FIRE"" mode when your team makes three baskets in a row! The arcade style action is very fast and exciting with lots of slam dunks and 3-pointers that often result in very high scores! This NBA licensed title has all the teams and all the star players from the time of its release. If you want some fun playing basketball on the Game Boy Color then there is not a better game out there to get."
2,Rew's a snooze....,"It seemed like a good pedigree.. Kimberly Rew...guitar player with the Soft Boys and Katrina and the Waves; the CD had a sunny, power-poppy title... ""Tunnel Into Summer""...I thought I couldn't go wrong! Well,I'm afraid the old adage...""never judge a book..."" applies in the negative here. Let me qualify something first...Rew is a good musician, with a crisp, ringing guitar tone and amiable chord chemistry, BUT... a compelling songwriter/singer he is NOT! With the impressive roster of guest artists on the album and considering who he has worked with in the past, it's a shame this material just kind of...lays there and fails to inspire repeat listenings."
4,Stroyteller? Absolutely!,"Paul Auster? Well known author, a novelist. No, it's better if we inspect this writer without any restrictions. Because he is unmeasureable. Essays and fiction. Beyond the Red Notebook: Essays on Paul Auster, this is one of the best essaycollections i've ever read. Although it is not a fiction, you can still notice that he is discussing about the same problems as he does in he's novels. All these essays are each one involved with a self-seeking. Like Auster is trying to prove that his standpoints in novels are true. I would compare Auster with Susan Sontag. Sontag's style is similar to Auster's one. So this book is a good one in two aspects: composition and the essays itself. So, why I put only 4 stars. Well, it always seems to me in every book that there could be something more. But this is a great book, no doubt about that."
5,Highly Recomended!,"""The Hotel"" is a great book that goes behind-the-scenes of the Plaza Hotel. The author interviews maids, chefs, janitors, managers, and many others. The book is set up in chapters that go day-by-day - truly showing ""a week in the life of the Plaza."""
5,Solomon's Men,"Professional thief Gregory Valdez finds himself in a world of trouble when he is hired to steal an ancient artifact long hidden in a church in Portugal. Not knowing the true identity of the item he was hired to steal, he finds himself being pursued by the last remaining Knights Templar now known as Solomon's Men. Things go terribly wrong when Valdez learns the true identity of the artifact. Glen Starkey takes the reader into the strange world of a secret organization formed during the inquisition to hide and protect the true shroud of Jesus from the Pope who was about to put the Knights Templar on trial for heresy. This is a well written thriller filled with action and well developed characters."
2,Falls short of its goal,"I bought this book (regrettably now) and read it, hoping to gain an introduction to the industry that I will be joining as a soon to be MBA graduate. Unfortunately, this does not stand up to its billing as a college level text. It would be ok for an undergraduate, survey or overview type course. But for those seeking a serious look at the airline industry, I cannot recommend this book."
3,Outdated,"""A simple, smooth style of explaining the economics of the airline business. But unfortunately it's out of date. Better read the work of Belobaba."""
3,I was a bit hasty,"I decided to give this a second look, after writing a rather lukewarm review of it earlier. I must admit that it is not as bad as I earlier may have implied. If given a very careful and dedicated read, there is sufficient detail to gain some insights into the airline industry. Much of it is redundant with general business concepts, so I still don't think it's worth the money for someone with extensive experience or an MBA to bother with. However, for an undergrad or those without more formal training, it could be valuable."
1,Breaks easily.,"Last Fall I purchased a Roto-Weeder, but didn't use it til yesterday. After removing about 10 weeds the cutting end just split in two. It is made of plastic, and the twisting of the rods causes stress on the end. It comes with no guarantee. If it were made of a more durable material rather than plastic, it could be a good unit. Otherwise, it is a waste of money unless you are weeding in sand....Wayn"
3,Works before it breaks,This is an effective way to uproot the broadleaf weeds. The ratchet mechanism will stop working soon but you can still use it if you are inventive enough. You can disassemble it and drill two new holes to secure the bottom to the pole with two thicker and longer screws. I got rid of so many weeds that it becomes addictive.
4,Delightful,"It is a heartwarming book about the many viruses, bacteria, and pests that have made life for homo sapiens interesting for thousands of years. Herein you can read all about mumps, measles, and malaria (if you want to read about the pleasant diseases) or plague, anthrax, and rabies (if you want to read about the unpleasant ones). Each has a fascinating story to tell.What can you do with this book? Well, you can read aloud the descriptions of gastrointestinal diseases at the dinner table. You can describe the diseases that cause hives with someone who is itchy. Or you can cheer up an old friend suffering from a disease by describing several diseases that are worse. This book is a barrel of laughs, I tell you. Get yours today."
2,some misinformatoin,"I've read only a few of the germ chapters described in this text and chose to read no more after encountering some blatantly incorrect information. For instance, with Rabies, the author states humans can only contract the disease if bitten by a rabid animal. Not true. Infection can be transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal or another human by contacting saliva with an open wound or mucus membrane. The author also states that humans are a dead end for the virus because we can't infect others. Absolutely not true. Visit a hospital with a rabies patient and you'll likely get a very different opinion as to the danger of the virus spreading.Overall, the information felt unverified and dashed off. Making this a primer for some I suppose but hardly a definitive much less accurate work."
2,A few errors,"I'm not a scientist, so I trusted all the facts in this book. However, a biologist friend of mine (a specialist in plagues, no less) took a look and she pointed out five or six big time scientific errors. To be fair, she said they were the kind of errors that most everyone but a highly trained person would miss. I don't know if these have been corrected in later editions, but I thought I'd send out a warning."
2,an engineer's view,A worthless book from the perspective of actually doing image reconstruction from projections.
4,excellent filtering and very comfortable,"I have been using these Moldex masks on my job for several years. The company stopped purchasing these for a much cheaper brand. For the price, these are the best masks I've found for general purpose. I use them for everything from blowing out dust in electric motors and brakes to mowing and edging. The best feature by far is the comfort factor. There is no metal band across the nose bridge and the nose pad is so much softer. The elastic bands stay pliable much longer than other brands and I've never had the bands break when donning and doffing. Top it off with a price less than a buck a piece and you won't find a better particulate mask. Function, form, price, comfort, durability... you just can't beat that."
4,Cool picture book about Mackinac,"I just visited Mackinac Island over the summer and got to take a horse and buggy tour. Everything in the book is right on - our tour guide talked about the hitching order of the horses and how the horses stand in the same order even when they're not hitched together (like when they're out in the pasture). The only drawback to this book is that I don't know if people who aren't from Michigan or haven't been to Mackinac Island would be very interested in this story. But I am from MI and have been to Mackinac a few times, so I think this book is great."
3,Gay Horsey Story,"My heart and spirit soared with Island breezes as I read this delightful tale. Oh how grand, how succinct and well stated. Any child will surely benefit from reading this story of Three Gay Horses. The three horses go three by three everywhere about and around the island-by three. I can count to three now. A wonderful tail, highly recomended for three year olds!"
3,"Easy to read, with the alphabetic and numerical fundamentals","This book is a simple introduction to the fundamentals of hieroglyphics. The alphabet, the numbers, and some other simbols are translated and shown with pronunciations. Included is a short introduction to the history of the study of hieroglyphics. This is not a dictionary, but can teach you to read and write names. Good for young readers."
2,Looking for the Right Book,First of all this book might be what you are looking for as an informational book. This book really gives the history and only a couple of hieroglyphs. I mean you can learn a lot of history and not a lot of hieroglyphs if that is what you want. Really this is not a good book in gerneral at all if all you want to is learn hieroglyhps.
2,Disappointing,"A few of the tracks are decent, but the majority are poor.Disapointing from a band thats supposed to be giving the Beasties a run for their money"
3,Ventriloquist's review,"Folkmanis'18"" Plush Beaver Puppet is well made, an accurate representation of a beaver, and relatively easy to manipulate. I particularly like the the way the beaver's flat tail can be used to good effect.As amateur ventriloquist, my only objection to the puppet is that it is suitable only for close up work. The fur and the eyes are so dark that the eyes cannot be discerned from any distance. The trademark beaver teeth are also hard to see.The puppet does work well close up. It is not scary for small children the way many accurate animal puppets are and that is definately a plus in my book."
4,Try It -You might Like It,"This was a great fun loving story about how children percieve things they have never tried. My grandson loves this book,we've read it over and over. Since reading this story he is more interested in trying new things. It was also a wonderful teaching tool for ""following through with what you ""say"" your going to do"". I think its a must read for everyone."
1,You would have to be stupid to buy this.,A smart person would buy a CompactFlash card and avoid the problems of a spinning platter that is sure to fail.
1,THIS A TOTAL FRAUD,This is a Fraud. The photograph show this item as a new hard drive. It is actually a refurbished drive. The PCMCIA adapter is not a Hitachi brand it is an off no Name brand. THIS IS A TOTAL FRAUD AND AMAZON IS RESPONSIBLE.
2,This game is a JOKE!,"This game has NO realism in the world of boxing whatso ever. Last years knockout kings at least had a strategic gaming method and a training mode. This year, no training, and requires no strategy at all. Ive mastered Knockout Kings 2001, all my friends would come over and get killed. But this year, all you have to do is MASH buttons to win fights. Wheres the stratedy in that? The boxers look great, but the gameplay ... I like that its quiker n' everything, but its just not realistic. If i wanted a game like this, i could have gotten Ready 2 Rumble, or some other ... games like that. If your looking for a game 10x's deeper than this piece of ... game, i say go for HBO BOXING. I know the graphics ..., but its alot deeper than this. Hopefully, HBO Boxing will come up to a follow up. ... NBA Live series went to .., Madden got killed by NFL 2k2, and Knockout kIngs 2002 might as well be a liscensed boxer Ready 2 Rumble follow up. ..."
2,Not good at all,"This game does have nice graphics and sound. The punch selection is pathetic. There is no way to choose body blow v. head blow. You can get your boxer to move around the ring, but you cannot truly make him duck and bob. Basically all you do is try to press your buttons faster than the computer can. If your fighter is ranked higher, no problem, fight someone tougher than you and its aggravating. Basially you just stand there and exchange blows until someone falls. No strategy."
1,A Button Mashing Mess !!,What can I say I could not wait for this game to come out and now I wish it never did !! What was EA Sports thinking on this one ? Not even a way to train your fighter you just jump in the ring and start flinging punches and who ever is lucky enough to land the most wins !! And when you fight Ali even in the easy mode you all but have to hit him with a Bat to beat him !! This game is just a big mess !! Save your money and your time on this one I wasted mine a lot of mistakes by EA sports on this one !!
1,disgrace for boxing fans,This game is a total disgrace. This game is bad beyond belief. shame on ea sports. one for the garbage can. Dont waste your money.A real stinker.
1,Worst Boxing Game Ever,"This is absolutely the worst boxing game ever, the control is slow and cumbersome. Sure it looks good but if its no fun to play who cares."
2,Lacking,"I was happy to see some new faces in the game (Klitschko Bros) but like others have stated, it is not strategic and lacks the ""boxing"" of Knockout Kings 2001. It is true to say that every fight is like a slugfest and the one that can hit the buttons the fastest wins. I hope they release a new Knockout Kings and return to the 2001 formula."
1,dlong504,"This game is horrible. It isn't worth the time playing or the money you spend. If you are looking for a boxig game don't buy this. This is a button smashing free for all, the person who either has Ali or presses buttons faster will win always. If you want a great boxing game buy knockout kings 2001!"
1,Flat out horrible,"This game is the worst game I've ever played and I'm the probably the biggest boxing fan out there. The controls are horrible, I can't stand using the joystick I wish I could use the directional buttons. You can't control body shots and the manual gives NO instructions on how to throw body shots. The career mode is a disaster. Bottom line don't by this game, save your money. Good news, I heard that Mike Tyson's boxing will be better. Cross your fingers."
2,nice graphic but not much else,"I was a big fan of this series but EA made a wrong turn with this version. Graphics are excellent but after that everything is very poor. My main gripe is with the controls, you cannot control body shots and nowhere in the manual does it show you how. In the Career Mode, there is no training section and you are limited in how you detail your fighter. KK2001 is way better than this version, so don't even bother upgrading to this version."
2,NOT GOOD!,"Like the other reviews I have to say I'm very disappointed in EA Sports for releasing this title. The only good thing I can say about the game is the graphics are better than 2001, other than that Knockout Kings 2001 is a much much better game. Save your money."
1,The Absolute Biggest Disapointment in EA Games.,"If ever a company has taken a step backward in development, well this is it! There is no strategy what so ever. Just get up and bang away at the buttons. For those who own other versions of Knockout Kings you are in for a huge disapointment. When you play this version it's like playing any of the older versions in slugfest mode. Only problem is that this is the only mode for the entire game. Forget about ring introductions, referee interaction or camera pans in the corner between rounds because none of this is there. Fighting is totally, totally unrealistic. If you like banging buttons relentlessly with no strategy involvement go ahead and buy this game. If you're a boxing fan looking for a realistic and strategic game ... [get this]"
2,I'd rather be a yankee by tullis,the book was said to be in good condition and while the text was in good condition the cover was ripped off. I would not have purchased this copy if seller had described the book having a ripped cover. I will not purchase any more books from this seller.
5,Very informative,"A great book on natural areas of florida that includes state, local, and national parks. When most of us think ""Florida"", we think of Walt Disney, Orlando, and Miami. This book is a guide that describes the other side of Florida - the unspoiled natural places. A must have for wildlife and nature lovers."
2,Base falls off,"Quality seems good. Good thick glass and quality medal dispensing mechanism are all present. However, the metal base falls off. I have 3 of these and the base has fallen off of all of them. For all of the other quality touches, it seems strange for them to have just glued on the base to the glass in a way that it just falls off."
5,Fantastic!,"After several plastic models from the stores, this has been the exact soap dispenser that I've been looking for. Very well made. Sturdy, solid and very attractive. Lovely!"
5,Nice solid soap dispenser,"I normally would not have spent so much on a soap dispenser, but I really wanted a brushed stainless or nickel dispenser and all of the reviews I read about other dispensers complained about them rusting and the cheap quality. When I found this one the reviews were so good that I decided to spend the money and go for it, and I am so happy I did. Immediately when I took it out of the box I was impressed with the high quality - it's very solid and elegant looking. It works well and dispenses smoothly, and after a couple months no problems so far with rust. I'd definitely buy this again!"
4,Excellent all-in-one guide,"""A Naturalist's Guide to the Canyon Country"" is an excellent overview of the natural history of the Colorado Plateau, and especially valuable for first time visitors and amateur naturalists. When my sister brought her family to visit this past June, we consulted this book every hour of every day. The adults and the children all found it invaluable for both identifying plants and animals and learning something about their life history. No, the guide is not all-encompassing, but most of the major players are here. I especially appreciated the inclusion of the little guys- especially the beetles lizards! We also appreciated the extremely sturdy binding, which held up well against all of the abuses that a 9-year-old could think of."
4,Very informative guide,"I recently visited Arches and Moab for the first time and picked up this book while down there. This is a great book to carry in your pack as you hike or bike and generally explore the area. There were some facets that I felt were lacking. I found a few plants that I could not identify using this guide, and the I wish that there would have been information regarding seedlings of plants listed in the book. Other than that this is a great book to carry with you, it is a little wide to carry in a pocket, but great for packs and has a very sturdy binding."
3,Sheer ankle high,"These socks are very sheer and of good quality. There is "" elastic at the top of the wide band. The elastic left a compression mark just above my ankle which is about 7-1/8"". I prefer non-binding socks."
1,Dim and Fragile,Barely bright enough to see inside your camera bag.Attachment threads are plastic and will break off inside your camera's tripod socket.As a focus assist you're better off with flash IR emitter.As exposure lighting is too dim and incorrectly positioned on bottom of camera.Overpriced and lower power LEDs are outdated.
2,Only half worked,"I bought a double CD and only one of them worked. The 1st CD was good , the 2nd disk would not play.So that one went out the window. I will have to ponder awhile if I will buy any CD's from amazon again."
1,NOT WASHABLE,"The paint lasts a while and would otherwise be great to use except for the fact that it is NOT washable. It's hard to get off skin and it doesn't come out of clothes. I am going to try another brand to hopefully find some paint that is truly washable. My daughter wears an art apron or smock, but it often gets on her skin (or even hair, which it then dyes!!) and may accidentally get on her clothes.. to which it does not come out. :("
4,Paint OK but a very purple blue,"This paint is fine - covers well and seems washable enough but I was disapointed with the color. It's a very purplish blue, not a royal blue like I was hoping for."
3,"Interesting, yet somewhat unsatisfying.","I must agree with other reviewers on this work: while certainly an interesting read, it is not quite as satisfying as one might hope -- especially if familiar with the author's other works.It must be kept in mind that this book is but a draft, unfinished upon Golding's untimely death. Yet for that very reason it is of interest to those who are intrigued by the workings of the writing process: here is a text that is but in 'draft form', and offers a none-too-often seen glimplse into a writer's mind, before revisions and editing have cleared away all the excess stone from the statue.Golding's grasp of the Classical world lends a nice touch of familiarity to this short novella, which I would recommend for fans of his works, and those curious of the writing process."
4,One of a kind,"I was skeptical when reading the first chapter on whether it would be an interesting book but as I read 2 and 3 I couldn't put it down. I fell in love with the main characters (Tristan and Lily), and I have not found any other characters like these two who could possibly make love such a powerful thing. This book is a keeper!"
4,Found what I needed to know,"As a gardener, and a person who has struggled to make Persimmon trees part of my landscape, I was very pleased with that section of the book in particular. I learned about various varieties and where they grow best and what to expect in the way of problems and how to solve some of the problems. Definitely the best thing I have read on this small area of gardening. I also passed the book on to a couple who like to grow ""heirloom"" fruits of all sorts, and they really loved it too."
5,LOVE.,LOve this. My husband hasn't taken it off. Really hope I can find similar things for him. Great Necklace :)
2,Worse than last year,"There are less replay features. No camera angle choices. Fielding is basically impossible for any tough plays. If you want to play like Ichiro forget it. Trading players and signing free agents isn't challenging like Madden football. They are just ""dumb"" features that let you get all the best players. If realism and playibility are features you are looking for, skip this game."
1,"Pathetic attempt at baseball, ASB2003 Kicks TP2002's butt","I wanted to see if EA could beat Akklaims perfection, but they came in wayyy below expectations. This baseball game is the worst I have ever played. Do yourself a favour and buy ASB2003."
1,Dont waste your cash.,"This game is bad. I thought I'd be on it for hours, but I lasted 30 minutes. The game play is dull. The situations aren't realistic. I dont recamend a game where Toby Hall can beat Sammy Sosa in a HR derby. The graphics are horrible. I cant tell the difference between Bonds and Preston Wilson! The stadium graphics are OK even though They're not as good as ASB2003 and WSB2K2. I'd recomened not to wast your $$$ and buy ASB2003 or High Heat Baseball 2003."
3,No Steps to Improvement,"I have bought every Triple Play game since '97 and the game has gotten better every year except for 1 aspect; gameplay. From '97 all the way to '02, it has remained the same. Just some simple changes could be made to make this game better. This is just an average game..."
2,Mediocre,"Do the people who made tp02 even try to make it better than last years? They did not suceed in any case. It is relatively to hit and pitch, but fielding is just too difficult. My advice: buy High Heat 2003 instead"
4,Not too bad,"This game is definitely addicting. The graphics and gameplay are really awesome. The most annoying parts of the game are the music, the fact that home run derby is way too easy, and that the easiest level is too easy and the hardest level is to hard. Playing the pro (middle) level is just about right. I win some games and lose some games. It's a bit hard on the pro level to strike people out, but it can be done. One truly great mode to play is human vs. human. I believe that this is the most realistic part of the game. The batting cursor can be invisible so that you really have to tell what type of pitch (fastball, curveball, etc.) it is before you can swing. It really gives the game a good, true feel to it. As said before, the announcers are sometimes inaccurate with their calls and there needs to be a dynasty-type mode, but overall I would definitely recommend this game."
3,Fun but too easy,yo! dude this is a pretty good game but on easy you can [rock]by winning 35 to 2. You can also hit 30 home runs. On medium you still win almost every game just by a closer score. But on hard its impossible to beat. If you really want a challenge this is a good game to buy or if you want the easisest sports game around.
4,homerun derby,I have had this game for a while let me tell you Ive also have high heat and all star baseball and triple play is better than those two no matter what anybody says those two are not better.The graphics on triple play are better stadium wise and player wise.My only complaint is I think the graphics could be better and the players heads are too big just like everybody else has said. I think the people who play the game say its too easy are playing on the rookie level or pro.They should try the all star level when playing a game. During home run derby though its too easy.Also what [makes me mad] is the repeating replays when there is men on base and you the hit the ball it also bothers me when you are playing defense. Thats basically my opinion triple play is better than high heat and all star baseball.
3,The Best Baseball Game This Year. BUT!!,"I game is good, but it needs to be realistic. True too life. There have to be injurys. There has to be something were you can give a player a day off. Like catchers and pitchers need at least 3 days off. and so on and so on?"
1,What went wrong?,"I played a demo of this game and it's worthless. It's so hard to put the bat on the ball even on the easy mode. The pitches just wiz by, you have to swing and guess it will be a strike (it's that hard to tell). Pitching isn't any easier and it takes a long time to throw the pitch you want. This makes games seem much longer, almost like the length they are in the Major Leagues. It just takes away from the fun of it. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to wait until Triple Play 2003 comes out to see if it got any better."
3,Rating,Triple Play for PS2 is good but could be better its kind of like Griffey's baseball i would like to know if and when the new one is coming out. I think that the game could be better and you should make it like bases loaded for nintento players should be able to charge the mound. The graffix are good but it could be a lot better that circle thing in the middle is not triple play baseball i been buying these games for PS1 and they never had that hitting icon. Thank you for your time
1,TP 02 is BS,"I can't agree more, with the other ratings I have read. I too find the game very hard to play in all aspects. Who would thinkEA Sports would make something like this, after all the good sports games they have put out. In other words,who would havethunk it...SQUEEZENYC"
1,Poor customer service from Amazon,"The product description clearly stated ""4-Pack"" - but Amazon refused to ship the items as described - the first customer service representative I spoke with agreed with me that this was a 4-pack and reshipped my order. My order arrived ""shorted"" a second time, when I contacted Amazon.com again I was told there was a typo and I would not get the 4-pack I ordered. Amazon.com offered a refund but I didn't want a refund, I wanted the recycling bins that I ordered. The customer service manager basically told me the description was wrong and that there was nothing she could do."
3,Its ok but not as good as the original .,The Amazon description is a plug and gasket what you receive is a package of 4 drain plug gaskets but no plugDorman 65292 AutoGrade Oil Drain Plug and Gasket!It is finally described accurately.Fit on my Kia drain plug is ok but not as tight fitting as the oem plug gasket.
4,Huge Trek Fan!,"Nice to see these on blu-ray although disappointed to see the prices start at $80 , seems like a rip-off to me like back when the DVD's were selling for $120 per season.I wouldn't buy this until after these seasons are released seems they drop below $60 after the release date. By in reality I would say it's true worth is around $50."
5,star trek rocks,So glad I bought this item - no commercials and it brought back really good memories. always a plus to have
5,Awesome!!!!,"come on guys aren't you trekkies? I guess not, all these episodes are awesome, I mean yeah you might have a couple of poorly written episodes in there, but they are still worth watching over and over again! I mean this all comes from some of the greatest minds!..."
3,After season 1 I had high hopes for this season,"However, whoever did the remastering really let us and all of humankind down with the shoddy work they did on this season.Granted, quite a bit of it looks and sounds good. But what looks bad, looks really really bad. Did they let some idiot right out of university do the restoration? I actually replaced my hdmi cables and reset my receiver and tv back to defaults 10 minutes through the first episode because I was convinced there must be some sort of hardware failure that happened when I powered it all up. But no, it's actually just a poorly done restoration/video mastering job.If I did this bad of a job at work, I'm fairly certain I'd be let go. I wholeheartedly encourage whoever owns Star Trek TNG to fire both the clowns that did this restoration as well as anyone on staff that greenlighted this release."
1,Not a good purchase,"I purchased this item in late September 2009. I never got my order delivered to me. I contacted the seller several times, but so far have yet to hear from them how the situation can be resolved.I am not confident I will ever hear from them again. From now on I will find a seller that offers option that requires a signature from the buyer at the time the package is delivered. Without it the buyer has little or no proof that an item got delivered properly to them. I would give this purchase experience zero stars but that option was not available , Hence the single star."
5,why do we have to wait till Dec 4 for the Blu-ray!,"man I'm tired of this CRAP! ALL the Blu-rays of TNG are done! Why dont Paramount just release them all NOW! Same day release! I mean it's stupid to make us wait a few month for season 2, then a few more months for season 3! I mean come on! Thats kids stuff! they did the same crap when the original DVD set came out in 2002!!!!!!"
3,Not as Good as 1st Season Blu-ray picture quality,"There is a fair amount of debate on this season - some say it is ""VHS quality"", while others say it is ""perfect."" It is neither - but it is inconsistent.You can very much tell the difference between season 2 and season 1. Season 1 was crisp and high quality. Season 2 has a lot of artifacts and fuzziness about it and worst of all - within individual episodes, it can be clear, HD quality in one shot and DVD like in the next. It is clear that CBS did a much better job with their transfer than the outsource firm. And I am not overly sensitive - you can definitely see the difference between the two. Now - it is still better than DVD quality overall and the bonus material is great.Season 2 is not my favorite season, as I believe Season 3 on are the best, but still enjoyable and worth it.Engage."
3,TNG'S Sophomore season hits a few bumps,"After a so-so shakedown season, Star Trek:Tng season 2 premiered in the autumn of 1988. It was soon apparent that year 2 would not be the best this show would offer. A few episodes such as: WHERE SILENCE HAS LEASE, A MATTER OF HONOR, CONTAIGION,and Q-WHO were actually very good, but the rest of the season was poorly written. Buy these dvds only because they belong in your star trek library but remember the best for this show is still a few seasons away."
5,Worth the investment,"Some episodes were better than others, but I enjoyed watching them in sequence especially without commercial interruption. The special features are interesting. The quality of the picture and sound is outstanding (compared to TV) and it helped me to become more familiar with how the series and characters evolved. I'm not a Trekkie nor a Techie - I just love TNG characters."
4,High definition for the win,"Like the first season, season 2 looks great in high definition. However, they changed the film stock in year 2, and it shows with a lot more graininess on Blu-ray in some scenes. But no matter, the effects shots look terrific, and if for nothing else, the ""director's cut"" of Measure of a Man makes the whole set worth getting."
3,revised,"So Amazon kept telling me to try this new streaming video thing they started. I watched a few old episodes of Star Trek Next Generation and thought it was OK. Then I got to season 2, episode 'Q-Who?'. I've tried several times now on several browsers and couldn't get the thing to play past about 7 minutes. I also can't get anything else to play through Amazon instant video. I also couldn't find a clear way to get customer support for this. Lesson learned: it might work for a while, but don't count on it to last.I guess it was a good idea while it lasted, but it looks dead now. Oh well, back to wimp.com...As of 9/7/2011 the episode is now working. Still maintaining a ranking of 3 since I had to beta test the product."
3,Good series to own,It is great to see how the characters develop from the first season. Dr. Polaski's character is good for the series(Whoopi too!). Did you know that she actually featured in the Original Series? There are some interviews in the last disc and you can actually see how she looked eons ago. I recommend this series.
4,TNG's Second improved season,"Aside fom the drastic changes that happened between seasons(casting and character promotions),The second season of TNG was a big improvement over the first.Yet it was still far from the great show it would later become.The intrduction of Guinan(as well as Ten-Forward)and the temporary residence of Dr Kathrine Pulaski in The Child,added a new dimension to the show.The best episodes include The Measure Of A Man,The Emissary,A Matter Of honor,and of course Q Who,which not only brought back Q,but introduced The Borg.The second season was a strong indication of the great things to come."
2,Huge step down from the Season 1 Blu-ray,"I was so looking forward to getting Season 2 of Star Trek:TNG on Blu-ray. Season 1 looked amazing. Such care and love went into that set and now all I can say is what happened?! Season 2 looks terrible! It's really sad and frustrating that this was actually approved of by CBS. The space shots are now totally inconsistent from the Season 1 space shots. Planets look blurry, the Enterprise looks unrealistic in certain scenes compared to the previous release. Even some of the interior shots with the actors look grainy.The only postives are the extras like the extended cut of The Measure of a Man with commentary, gag reel and new docs along with the old docs from the DVDs. Still, it's ridiculous at the quality drop for the actually episodes."
1,terrible Picture Quality...? Is this Really Blu-Ray Remaster....?,Now updated from 22.January 2013 .First Season was Amazing and every Episode was Remastert Perfectly but this Season 2 is just a very Terrible Picture Quality sometimes the same as DVD ....? Very inconsistent sometimes Great than AGAIN next min. just Terrible and very Fuzzy Picture.....? Not even there First Encounter with the BORG had a Great Picture very Fuzzy than good again than Fuzzy.....? Shame Paramount let others do the Restoration on Season two and not the same Qualified Peoples that gave us an Amazing Season 1 ......? As an Big Star Trek Fan I only give this one Star because of such an letdown to us FANS paying very good money for Fuzzy Inconsistent DVD Picture .....? Please dont let the Guys Remaster Season 3 that Butcherd / did Season 2 without Properly checking if the Quality is the Same as Season 1 Blu-Ray.....? Please......? Again ONLY 1 Star.....?
4,Its getting better.,"When I wrote that the first season was okay, the second season was much better but still not as good as the show became to be in the third season. They brought in a new doctor, Diana Muldar as Dr. Kate Pulaski. They built a new set, Ten Forward, they introduced the Borg, and Whoopi Goldberg the first major star to appear on TNG as Guinan. Here is some of my favorites in this season.Where Silence Has LeaseElementary,Dear DataThe Schizod ManLoud as a WhisperA Matter Of HonorThe Measure Of A ManTime SquaredThe Icarus FactorQ WhoEmissaryPeak PerformanceThis season was much better but the show still needed work, but watching this season proves that TNG was headed in the right direction."
2,Lwaxana Troi,"Lwaxana Troi is what made this season. The episode ""Manhunt' was the best episode in the first two seasons. That episode was so funny! Now, I will tell you what turned the other characters a little bit better. Riker has his beard. Worf is now Tactical Officer. Geordi is Chief Engineer. Deanna changed her outfit. Picard is still stuck-up. Wesley is a little bit better about being so whiney. The other good episodes out of this season are ""The Dauphin"" and ""The Emissary"". Those are good episodes. Other than that this was junk."
5,Star Trek Next Generation,"Product first came with two of six disks missing. With an email to the seller, that problem was solved in about two and a half weeks. I have been enjoying the TV series immensely since then."
4,StarTrek Next Generation Season 1,"Since I have seen, and have All StarTrek, original and next generation,on vhs, I would rate them all great.I would like to sell my vhs tapes, if anyone wants to buy them."
5,Start of good things to come for Star Trek: The Next Generation,"""Elementary, Dear Data"" shines as the first truly great episode for Star Trek:TNG season 2. The story is well written with only a few suspensions of belief (outside the normal sci-fi-esque elements). The acting is quite good with Data and La Forge improving and starting to own their roles. The director allowed the story to unfold without resorting to gimmicks or the normal pitfalls which plagued season 1. The holodeck still has a freshness about it that intrigues the audience without feeling overdone. A great mixture of literature, suspense and science fiction for which Star Trek:TNG would become famous."
5,engimatic appearance by the Borg,"That trickster Q re-appears and forces the Enterprise to confront the Borg for the first time.One is left wondering why a nervous crew doesn't heed the advice to flee (they should have!), nor destroys the damaged Borg cube. But, then we'd not have as much plot development later. An interesting episode!I'm rewatching all of ST:TNG with the GF, in sequence, years after seeing them sporadically when they first aired. They really do hold up more than 2 decades later-- more than can be said for most TV. Enjoy!"
3,"Good, but dated, episode (Fermat)","This was a good episode, but the writer(s) dated themselves by including a very small side-reference to Fermat's Last Theorem, which Capt. Picard said hadn't been solved ""for over eight hundred years.""Sadly, this dated the episode and destroyed realism for me because Fermat's Last Theorem was solved just six years after this episode (in 1994 by the Brit Andrew Wiles).It is possible, however, that the proof was lost in the wars and socio-economic collapses of the mid-21st Century, however unlikely.Otherwise, a fun episode."
5,Next Generation,"Watched the first episode tonight, and was totally happy with it - all the right characters, and good clear pictures on my wide screen. With 6 discs and 4 x 50 minute shows per disk, that makes really good value for money."
5,A Trek Fan to the End,I'm always a sucker for Star Trek. Season 2 has some memorable episodes as the cast begins to come into its' own.
3,Capricious Entertainment,"This season of star trek was very fickle. It had moments of brilliants, Measure of a Man amd its moments of disapointment, Outrageous Okona. Still it was provokative and entertaining so if you enjoy Star Trek or sci/fi, you will probably appreciate season two on DVD."
2,HTV POOR JOB.,"Sad that CBS outsourced this season. Very inconsistent remastering. I was very happy to hear this show was getting a blu-ray treatment by the ""CBS Team"". Not some hacky company that obviously dose not care. just don't watch it directly after season 1. If the outsourcing is not true, than I would love an explanation."
2,Hoping for replacement disks (maybe incl. when you buy S3?),"Let's get straight to the point:- I can live with paying again for something that I already got (Season 2 on DVD)- I can live with paying a ""high price"" (I just bought the entire Seasons 1-7 of Voyager on DVD and it was cheaper than TNG-R S1+S2 together)- I can live with pale, blurry planets in Season 2- I can live with sometimes too grainy picture in some scenesBut I can NOT live with weird Enterprise shots where the ship is jolted/crimped flying over a planet, as seen in ""Loud as a Whisper"". Enough is enough, this is SO quick and dirty and totally unworthy of this iconic series.I'm hoping for replacement disk(s), maybe included when buying Season 3?"
2,Very limp season finale,"A very limp finale to season 2, mostly footage from earlier episodes in ""flashback"" form.The premise (something attacking Riker's CNS) is a bit weak, but the execution tells me that when season 2 was produced, they either ran out of money at the end, or ratings were weak enough to need to recap ""highlights"" before season 3. Maybe the recap format made more sense when broadcast was the norm, and Tivo didn't exist.(Rewatching all of ST:TNG with the GF, in sequence, years after seeing them sporadically when they first aired)"
5,Coming together...,"As many other reviewers have noted, the second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation is a huge improvement over the first season. The crew is starting to come together as an ensemble and assuming the roles that they'd occupy for the rest of the series. Moreover, the episodes are beginning to emphasize their characters better. The season still suffers from too many ""all-too-human"" aliens, but that was somewhat unavoidable given the budget. I even like Dr. Pulaski (Diana Muldaur), the replacement for Dr. Crusher. She fills the ""Bones McCoy"" role. While some of the episodes are corny, many are instant classics, such as ""Q Who,"" ""The Emissary,"" ""Measure of a Man,"" and ""Elementary, Dear Data."" However, these DVDs aren't out in blu-ray yet, so I'd recommend waiting. In the meantime, you can rent them from Netflix, which has them all available on instant-play."
3,Will Not Be Supported Under Windows 7!,"The HP LaserJet 1012 was a really great small business or home office printer. It had easy to replace toner and it stood up well over time. Apparently, too well because HP wants it to be obsolete now. According to the HP Support website, the HP LaserJet 1012 Printer is ""Category 6"". That means the printer is not supported for Windows 7, and will not be supported at a later date either. (Category 5 devices are the ones that ""will be supported"" at a later date.)In other words, HP has determined that the printer you bought and haven't broken yet isn't making them enough money, so they won't be wasting time making any drivers. Don't bother buying this printer unless you plan to break it before you upgrade to Windows 7 or are going to attach it to a Unix system."
3,Installation problems,"Like Amadeuz, I had a hard time installing (tried multiple times, even returned one printer and tried another), though I use XP pro on a P4 machine. Only unlike Amadeuz, I gave up after 4 tries. The problem may be with my Dell, which doesn't seem to like its USB 2.0 ports. The point of commenting here is just to reinforce that while installation may be seamless for most, there's something quriky and buggy about either the installation software or the instructions that will cause some people problems. I had to guess at stars because I never got to use the machine, though I believe the people who are happy with it."
2,No Vista Support!,"Awesome on XP, but Vista is being ignored by HP. It's quite a joke. Worthless on Vista..."
5,GREAT PRINTER,I have had the HP 1012 for four months and have loved every day with it. It is a quality printer with a great toner cartridge (I was sick of those little and expensive ink cartridges). It also has a maual feed that can take envelopes. WHAT A BARGAIN!Kit should get one of these --- he knows that HP has always made great printers!
3,OK Little Printer,"I needed a cheap printer quick and this one happened to fill the bill. The toner catridges are readily available, the print quality is all right and set up on xp was pretty much what would be expected from any printer. It even networked without a fuss.Conclusion: If you need a cheap printer for not too demanding jobs this is one."
5,The HP 1012 A Solid Performer,"Looked over many reviews and made, what turned out to be a very solid choice. I have the printer about 2 months now, and it has performed flawlessly. I found the paper did curl a little at the top when coming out of the printer (as some other reviews had mentioned) but that most probably is due to heat when the paper passes thru the printer...when the paper cooled it was fine...I did use 20LB paper at first but switched to a heavier 22LB paper and found the paper did not curl as much...The copies are sharp, & printing is quick, and you can use a ""highlighter"" immediately after making a copy with no smearing. For the price it beats my old inkjet and I am very happy with it."
4,Tempting Leap of Faith- given it away,"Third HP Laser in 12 years- 4ML (great, still works), 1100se (jams every print after just 75,000 prints- threw away), and now this one (very tempted to get non-HP).Out of box, quickly set up on Windows XP, very compact, better made/rugged compared with many. Print quality dissapointing- no great advances over other 2 HP's owned. Very swift printing. Paper curls a lot (perhaps particular paper stock). Compatible with Mac OS X as well as Windows (necessary as mixed home network).Overall, a good start, and hope more reliable than the 1100se.UPDATE- very quiet and small yet gave it away as page cost far too great, small paper-feeder (realistically 500+ a minimum), and quality not true 1200dpi. Got a HP 4200 workhorse as a replacement. TURNS IT TO 2 STARS as didn/t last 6 months!"
4,Functionally: Excellent. Paltry documentation,"This is a fine consumer/home office laserjet pinter. Affordable, quiet, compact (including a power cord with no ""wall wart"". Easy installation. Only two drawbacks (they are minor, but HP and other manufacturers need to pay attention to this):(1) One of the shoddiest quick start/set-up posters I've seen. A monochrome rebus on cheap paper. If you are not an experienced user of personal computers or printers, you may not understand what you're supposed to do.(2) No users manual. There is a 92 page pdf file, but HP (and others): please ship a manual with the product. Please!If you can get past that...then 5 stars:-)"
3,"Fast, but not kind to the paper","I have had this printer for a few months now, and I like how quickly it can print its first page. For my minimal printing needs (some websites, papers, etc.) it is fine in terms of speed and print quality. The one thing that is extremely annoying about this printer is that all the printed pages have a curling effect at the top and bottom of each page. I am hoping this is due to the paper I bought, but if that ends up not being the case I will surely regret this purchase."
2,Can't Stop the Steam,"In spite of this reliable printer's great reputation, it creates steam during the printing process. This is a real deal-killer. No matter how consistent its performance, there is no way I can recommend a printer that steams as it sucks moisture of out printer paper. It turns out this is a common complaint from owners of the LaserJet 1012. Be warned."
3,Can it pass the test?,"It all depends on the rewards of success:1. Instructions: GET A USB CABLE! The foldout instructional booklet will only confuse you, especially when it indicates that EITHER a serial or USB cable can be used.1A. INSTALLATION: I have this printer on my desk at work, and even the remote administrator installation (from IT) took a while, and TWICE to make sure it was done.2. This can be noisy, for such a little machine.3. Paper jams: having to take out the ink cartridge to remove paper concerns me.4. FAST- it does print fast; in fact, sometimes it seems the paper may shoot across the room.5. COST: I think HP should drop $40 off of the MSRP- it's a good printer to put with a $699 computer package, but not at $200 (MSRP) by itself."
3,question,"If it is USB, then you cannot share this printer so you can network and print from inside your LAN. Right?I cannot find 1015, which one user said it has parallel port. I dont want USB for a printer. Doing a search on web get me to a website in UK. Is 1015 only made overseas?"
3,Decent printer once you get it working,"I share some of the frustration of the guy from Denver.* 1st installation CD not functional at all - D: drive could not read it. Had to go back to store where I bought it to get a new one that actually worked* mine also had no serial port but that was negligible as I use USB anyway* very difficult time getting knowledgeable HP person on phone. Like many companies they have outgrown ability to serve customer* when I bought this, three weeks ago, printer cartridge was not yet available in stores, though it looks like you can order them online off HP websiteOnce the printer got going it was pretty good. Decent speed/print quality for the price. Beats the hell out of running up to Kinko's every time you have to print. I enjoy the printer but ideally the purchase would have been more trouble free."
3,Good until it quit working,"This printer did fine at my desk, but it only lasted a year and a half. The roller that pulls the paper into the machine quit working, and it won't be worthwhile to fix it since I only paid $100 in March of 2004. It was great while it lasted."
2,WARNING and BEWARE,"I previously gave this printer 5 stars. However, beware. If you print, say, 50 pages in a row, the printer slows from its rated throughput to only ca. 4 pages per minute. HP tech support confirms this, and indicates that a cheap printer 'without a fan' overheats, and compensates by stopping the continuous printing...it could not be expected to do any better. Then why is it rated at 15 ppm?What nonsense. The printer is misrepresented. If you only print a couple of pages at a time, then this is fine. But if you print out program code or book or article manuscripts, this is a BIG problem."
5,Great for home use!,"I am very pleased with this printer. I was replacing a color ink jet printer. I found myself needing color very rarely to never, so I thought I would enjoy a black and white laser printer more. This printer is easy to set up, fast to print, and documents look great. I highly recommend it for home use."
3,Installation may be a problem.,"Fortunately for me, I read the Amazon reviews before buying this printer. I was prepared with my USB cable that did not come with the printer. Also, many Amazon reviewers have had problems with installation, so when the printer failed to properly install on my new Dell, I quickly called expert help (thanks Scott).The expert went on-line for the necessary fixes from HP and the printer was soon up and running with good print quality for an inexpensive machine.The expert who installed my printer said that HP should do a better job providing software to support their products. I think many of the people who wrote reviews on Amazon would agree.Bottom line: If your printer does not immediately install, it may have nothing to do with you or the procedure you followed. Get some help instead of wasting your valuable time if you are not an expert. Good luck."
4,Talk To Me,"If you need to lie on your back & listen to music or guided meditation in bed, this pillow is wonderful. I've always found earbuds annoying; no need for earbuds anymore. I can easily fine tune the volume (without using iPod or CD player dials). I wish pillow was smaller in the middle where you lay your head. Also, the pillowcase provided is skimpy. For the $$$ price, I think that's an oversight."
5,Great Cookbook,I have had the paperback verison of this book since the 1970's. I used it so much it was completely falling apart. I was so happy to find that I could get it in the hard copy so I will be able to continue using it for another 40 years! I received it very quickly and it was in great shape!
3,"Fun, yet a bore","I played this game on PC, and I liked it oh so much better on PC. When my brother got his N64, I got Re-Volt for him (and partially for myself lol) to play. First problem I encountered was getting it to save on the memory card, it may just be my memory card, but that was very annoying. Also, it is almost impossible to get in the lead.Pros:1) Good Selection of cars2) Fun tracks3) Multiplayer (I love multiplayer games)Cons:1) Hard to get or stay in 1st place2) Memory card problemI got this game used for ..., so it wasn't that bad. If you have a couple extra bucks lying around, this game is worth getting, and is fun. However, in my opinion this game is better for younger games, probably 5th grade and below."
1,Misled,"This product advertises that it is realistic with 5-position tail with movement. This is wrong, realisticly it is a black and white picture of a buck on a piece of cardboard (about a 3rd of the size of a real deer) that folds up. It also claims to be used as a doe this is also untrue. Do not buy this cheap piece of cardboard."
5,All the classic silly songs I grew up with and remember fondly,Love it! Easy for kids to sing along to. Ideal for long car rides with the kids or just to sing along to around the house. Brings back memories.
5,It's like a karaoke bar,"I feel like I've met the characters in this book at a karaoke bar: they are charming and deplorable; funny and serious; candid and deceitful; and caring and slapdash-ing. But above all, they are provocative and charming. And like a karaoke bar, the novel is so much fun. As an educator, I would especially recommend this book to young adult males--the novel is gritty, lacking the sugar-coated, predictable plots found in some of the more mainstream YA novels (novels that are generally geared to young women.) This Funny Little Monkey had me laughing, snickering, cheering, thinking, and most of all, wanting more!"
1,I wasted my time on this book,"This book was recommended to me and I bought it. The language, the way it is translated into English, is difficult. Phrases some one and a half pages long with interminable appositions are very common. It is difficult to keep track of the subject and piece the story together. In fact, there is no story per se, just various monologues that are somewhat connected.I started the book and didn't like it, but I kept reading on hoping that it would eventually tie together, make sense, and that it would leave me with some interesting thoughts, ideas, etc. The book just ended. The only good thing about the book ending was that I could move on to the next one and forget about this one.I'll keep this book around in case I run out of toilet paper. That's the only use it should be put to."
2,only if you like cinnamon in tea,"I hoped this tea would taste predominantly of almonds with spices as a background; instead it tastes of cinnamon with a hint of almonds... It is a mellow tea, but you must like cinnamon."
5,"If you like amaretto, you'll love this tea","This is one of my favorite teas, but for some reason it is very hard to find in stores. I don't know if it's a local problem or nationwide. More people should be drinking this! Glad I can order it here - the price is great, too. It's soooo yummy. I brew it with 1 teaspoon of sugar in the raw, leaving about an inch of space in the mug, and top it off with milk. Yummy low cal yet satisfying late night comfort food.If you like amaretto, you should love this tea.Wish Amazon carried the Sugar Cookie Sleighride. That was a special flavor this Christmas and it was good, too. I wouldn't mind having about 40 boxes stashed away."
2,"disappointing, rather boring","I like the music of Medwyn Goodall. Likewise, I have an appreciation of Terry Oldfield. I love meditative, relaxation & New Age music. Om, however, offers nothing to recommend it. It lacks heart, with music that is milquetoast, pedestrian and rather uninspiring ... so much so that I found it annoying rather than relaxing. You would do no worse by buying one of those generic cheap CDs that are sold at kiosks in Walmart and Target.I purchased this CD to use with my massage therapy clients, but instead I believe I'll drop it from my collection ... something I hardly ever do. I can't imagine working with this music when there is so much more that's better.My advice is to listen to the samples before you buy."
4,Pretty realistic!,"I'd say this Uzi has about 80 percent of the original's realism, which is nice for Halloween but doesn't quite cut it when you're trying to rob a liquor store downtown. Thus, just the four stars."
1,Water Play,"The description of this toy was inaccurate. It is actually a Squirt Gun, which was not what my son expected......I guess that detail was not available at the time they prepared the ad? The water tubes on the magazines interfere with body of the gun, not much realism. Therefore, it is not getting much play-time."
1,Wrong Picture,"The item ANT sent me was a single 4 ft speaker with a plug, no transmitter, one speaker. The picture they show is not the product."
5,A true classic from an old-time master,"I didn't regret buying this book. It's a no-nonsense book from one of the great masters of the early Republic-era China. The pictures may be a little fuzzy, but it's logically presented in order for readers to analyze the movements. This book definitely forces you to think and this is not the book for those who are used to spoon-feeding!"
5,The Old Ones Are The Best,"The pictures and the throws are kind of hard to decipher, although this problem didn't bother me enough to take away a star. I love the cover, and the formatting is good. Writing is clear and very interesting.Overall, excellent book on this increasingly rare and little-known method."
3,"Photos are not good, vcds or dvds are better source for study","Low quality photos and short descriptions in the book are not good source for study. I think that vcds or dvds are better source for study of chinese wrestling. Nevertheless, the book has some historical value. Price is pleasant."
4,Good text if you're going to do the work.,"I recently picked up this book and basically agree with the other reviewers in that it is a quality book. The presentation is clear and pretty easy to follow. It's the kind of book that really gives you a place to start, but of course you've got to do the work. Isn't that always the way?One caution though, there is not much in the way of commentary on the history of philosophy of Chinese Wrestling in this book, it's more manual than text book."
2,plastic and weak,"We needed some really powerful electric motor. Based on the descriptions it sounded like a potentially good choice. But in reality it is a lot of plastic parts, the motor is not really powerful, and it did not tolerate any extra voltage. It was easy to put together for two 12 year-old boys, so in that sense it worked. But the end result is not very good, at least not for our project. The gears made some unpleasant noise despite all the greasing. In fact the only useful thing for our purposes was the grease which we used for our Lego gears. That's not so good for the price... This toy may be fine for less demanding projects."
1,Tips,this coin is being sold way under its value. To a very important collector they will pay around $100 used and $500 new. Why so low?
1,Horrible worked for a little while and died,"Worst battery for my laptop. Worked for a little while and after a month or so just died. I only use it now when I plug in my computer to an outlet, just won't hold a charge. This is the second non-Sony battery I purchased and the two I bought never worked properly. Save your money and only buy the Sony brand these cheap Chinese batteries are a waste of money."
3,THIS IS NOT THE COMPLETE EPIC!!!!!!,"I teach a classics in translation course at the University of Washington and I have had a few students who buy this edition of ""Jason and the Golden Fleece"" through Amazon.com. While I have no problem with the translation, I do have a problem with the fact that this edition does not state clearly that it is an abridged version of the epic. It is essentially books 2 and 3 of the four book epic. If you are buying this to read Apollonius' epic then get a different version like the Oxford World Classics version which is complete. You can find this much better edition under: Jason and the Golden Fleece: (The Argonautica) (Oxford World's Classics). Please be aware that this Penguin version is ONLY books 2 and 3 of Apollonius' epic."
3,Prose rendering of an important epic,"I don't approve of poems being translated into prose form as a matter of principle. In the case of this poem, which has so many features derived from Homer (e. g. Apollonius' hero list as compared to Homer's ship list or the description of Jason's shield after that of Achilles'), it would be even more interesting to have a line-by-line rendering. Were it not for this and Mr. Hunter's translation would be just nice as his clear and useful introduction is. Therefore I have to go for another translation which suits my requirements, I guess Peter Green's. By the way, this same problem unfortunately seems to occur in the Loeb Classical Collection translations of poetry."
4,Light load only!,"The good: This gearbox is easy to assemble and comes with a number of ways to attach it to your hobby device.The not so good: The little allen set screw that holds the output device to the shaft will not hold if loaded up very much. To be fair, I attached it to a drive wheel on an equitorial platform to slowly move a fairly large telescope, and it's just not heavy-duty enough for that."
2,"You Guys Are Kidding, Right??","This film simply meanders around in a most depressing manner going exactly nowhere. There is no story other than the unrelenting poverty of its characters. And you could have ended the movie at any number of points with no impact. It was almost like they realized they were running out of film and decided to wrap it up with a shot of the trolley boy parking his trolley for the night.When you watch this movie you will swear time has stopped. It is dreadfully slow and depressing. You do feel sad for characters trapped in this squalor without a hope in the world of getting out of it, but at the same time you can't help telling yourself that you don't mind growing old but you do mind growing old watching this movie.Kurosawa is a great filmmaker but this is a soulless movie with no redeeming qualities."
5,"A pick for collectors, dealers, and any interested in the history and development of jewelery","Understanding Jewellery has been revised and fully updated and offers identification and dating of all kinds of jewelry, from the late 18th century until the end of the millennium. From gemstone origins, values and testing methods to explanations of how values vary and good-sized color photos of bracelets, necklaces, pendants and more, this is a pick for collectors, dealers, and any interested in the history and development of jewelery."
5,Best tweezer ever - much better than tweezerman,This tweezer is the quality that tweezerman used to be - it's the best on on the market now!
3,This would be more like Annie Haslam Live in Japan,"One thing that all you true Renaissance fans should make note of....this is only a PARTIAL reunion of the band.Annie Haslam : vocalsMichael Dunford : acoustic guitars, vocalsTerence Sullivan : drums, percussionMissing isJohn Tout : Keyboards extraordinaire (he made the Band sound like a symphony and appeared on the first 9 albums)Jon Camp : Bass and vocals..He appeared on the first 11 albums and sang lead on several songs.Altho the songs are competantly performed....the bass and keys were an integral part of the Renaissance sound....and that's the part that any TRUE fan will immediately notice is missing....Close but no cigar.Altho I am a longtime Renaissance fan....without the inclusion of John Tout and Jon Camp...this cannot be considered a TRUE reunion tour..or albumAm sorry....but 3/5th of a great band isn't a reunion."
1,If you build a bigger lie ...,"I am amazed at the number of reviews given to this book that make no mention of the overt anti-Catholic bigoted tone of this thing. Did we read the same book?It's always popular to stand and wave a flag that says you stand against anti-Semitism and in favor of the Jews taking their proper place in the world etc etc., and that's fine. But, when did it become acceptable to exchange hatred for Jews for hatred for Catholics?If that's the way you think, you'll love this book.If, however, you're more than a bit concerned about being spit on by the books not so hidden agenda of Catholic bashing, then you'll be wasting your time with it.If you relish the thought that you could be an ""insider"" knowing things that Jesus himself told you He didn't know, then this is your meat. If you can justify telling yourself that you're smarter than the Savior, or at least the author of the book is, then this one will scratch your ears quite nicely."
1,Boo! Too many bad changes!,"I have to agree with previous online writers that the latest version of Billboard's Top Country Singles is not one to own. After seeing a sample page in a flyer sent to me and on Billboard's website, I noticed the changes: dropping the b-side information, discontinuing ranking the top five hits of each artist, discontinuing pricing information for each single among many other changes. I would like to get the latest version of this book, but I will not waste my money if this information is not included. I have the two previous versions of this book and those are great. I can only hope that if enough people don't like the new version that future versions will be changed back."
4,Modern Feng-Shui for the modern world,"Fast Feng Shui is an excellent beginner's book and informative for the intermediate user as well. It's practical approach, (forsaking the compass), allows the reader to take advantage of the benefits of Feng Shui without having to take a course in Navigation first. Straightforward, concise writing makes it a pleasure to read and refer to later."
2,Simplistic solutions that could be found in supermarket magazine,I was very disappointed in this book. Not much better than ideas that could be obtained through a supermarket store magazine article.
5,How To Accomplish the Impossible,"I bought the Fast Feng Shui book because I'm putting my house on the market and moving to another state. I rapidly read the book and decided that I needed a complete overhaul in order to show the house properly. I had no idea I had so much clutter!!!!Using the Feng Shui principles, I have totally changed the appearance of all my rooms. I have bought nothing extra, just moved the items that I own into different areas. And got rid of the clutter.The realtor came to review my property this last Saturday and she just went on and on about what a wonderful ambiance my house has. Believe me, it's only the Feng Shui.Within 30 days of cleaning up my wealth area, I've been offered an investment opportunity that really surprised me and I've lost 10 pounds. Thank you for the wonderful suggestions."
5,"Wow, what a great book",This is the best book to read if you are starting out with Feng Shui. Stephanie writes clearly and explaines the meaning of Feng Shui. Thank you for this insight. Christine Bury
4,Exotic and fascinating,"Never having visited Turkey, I found the location of this book to be exotic in the extreme. When several members of a group of young ""Goths"" are murdered in what appears to be ritualistic rapes and murders. Police Inspectors Cetin Ikmen and Mehmet Suleyman are attached to the case with orders from on high to clean up the city as soon as possible. An English friend of both the men, Maximillian, seems to be deeply involved and, as he not only has connections to the murdered teenagers but is also a magician, steeped in the traditions of Kabbalah, an ancient Hebrew practice, he is immediately suspected of involvement with the killings. Obscene drawings have been plastered over the walls of local churches, mosques and temples, adding to the general fear that Satanism is being practiced and that the local young people are being drawn into a cult that is more dangerous than romantic. It's an unusual story from another culture and one which I found to be most interesting."
2,Deadly Web,"I'm a fan of Barbara Nadel and I have lived in Turkey long term. Most of her novels are accurate and entertaining. ""Deadly Web"" is the exception. The plot is driven by a weird occult mumbo jumbo. The police department procedures are standard but the main suspect never grabs my interest. He is a charlatan from his entrance. Let this novel die the death it deserves."
1,a huge disappointment,"My son picked this item out, apparently the description was very impressive! Because the product that arrived sure was not!!"
2,Not what I expected.,The description for this product was misleading and it was a problem getting it to me honestly. Better luck next time I guess. Disappointing.
4,These are not army men.,"These are models, designed to go with armor models in the same series. Amazon lists them as ""army men"", they're not army men in the sense most Americans think of army man toys - they require assembly with glue of some pretty small parts.With that said, they're great recreations of each of the major weapons and clothing styles utilized by US Soldiers during World War II.If you are buying them for modeling or for educating, they're great, if you are buying them with small children in mind, they're not the right product."
5,Grdeat Model Kit,"It grieves me to see a classic model kit get knocked simply because it wasn't what customers expected. These model soldiers require a great deal of assembly (and painting!) but are well worth the effort. The equipment is well-cast, figures assemble easily and smoothly and the poses are excellent. This is a great kit that's been around for years. For figures to accompany 1:48 scale armor kits they can't be beat."
1,Do not buy these!!!,"The photo of these army men is so misleading. I received these men in the mail expecting to give them to my 7 year old as a Christmas present because he loves military toys. The men are about the size of a large ant. You have to assemble them thus the legs are about the size of a 1/2 an ant. The torso the size of the other 1/2 of an ant and then the head the size of a flea. Little hands in no way shape or form can assemble these or understand what they are. Additionally, they are not painted as shown. They are all the color green. Each piece is stuck into a jumble of plastic so you have to cut them apart and it is terribly difficult to discern what is what. Do NOT waste your money"
1,US Army Infantry GI Set,"My son selected this to buy with his allowance, after reading the description on Amazon. He was very disappointed when it arrived."
4,Hysterical!,This book is hilarious and at the same time informative! Who knew learning could be so entertaining? It has a lot of fun insights into different aspects of Japanese culture. I only wish the book was longer and went more in-depth.
4,Great Shirt,"This shirt is a nice addition for any fan of the show. Be aware if buying this for another, the title is misleading here- that is Trunks, not Vegeta."
5,Speaking directly to your soul,"Ronnie Nyogetsu Seldin's playing is beyond doubt from the soul and as such speaks the language of the soul. I listen to this and get lost in my own thoughts, letting time and all my tension slip away.Few have achieved Ronnie's comfort and intimacy with the Shakuhachi, and it comes through in this album. Though nothing can duplicate a live performance (I have had the priviledge of hearing him live several times) this compilation will come close enough to make you feel you are walking among the Komusos."
5,Northern Lights review!!,I don't think i will tell you what actually happens because you should try reading it first! It is a bit strange/different at fist but once you have read at least the second chapter you certainly won't put it down! I love the way its so in depth in all the different worlds and Phillp Pullman has put in every thing from his imagination to make this happen. It is a wonder and a sheer class of excellence. How its described and followed in detail is brilliant. I loved it and the follow on in HIS DARK MATERIALS. WELL DONE PHILLIP PULLMAN! YOUR DA MAN!!
4,An eye opener,"Northern Lights is a captivating tale of a young girl looking for answers. Her journey through a world of actionpacked fantasy, enthrals readers from start to finish.The author, Philip Pullman explores many issues in their world, which we can sometimes relate back to our society today.Overall, Northern Lights was a good book, aimed at mature readers.Please note that this book is not just a book to read for leisure, as you must also think as you are reading."
5,Northern Lights by Phillip Pullman - The best book for teens,"I have read the whole of the Phillip Pullman trilogy (Northern Lights, The Amber Spyglass, The Subtle Knife) and I thought all of them were riveting. I was glued to them! I wish Lyra's adventures with her deamon, Pantaliamon, could never end. They are fantastic! If you read this Phillip Pullman........ WRITE MORE OF THEM!!!!!!"
3,"An arduous, overwhelming and deep read","Northern Lights was an arduous and laborious read, far from enjoyable. Yes, the threads of the story were woven together to form an amazing and at times enthralling story, and yes, it was very cleverly written- as would be suggested by the number of awards the book has won. But it was not the type of book you would read for leisure. You really have to think as you read: what on earth is Aurora? What is elemantary particles?I may take this attitude towards the book simply because my mind is not mature enough to think as deep as the book requires for you to catch its meaning, but that's just my opinion."
2,it was kinda boring,"hey, i reckon northern lights is like, an ok kinda book. but it was sorta boring during heaps of places. but some places it was ok and kinda suspensful... i think i'm just repeating myself. anywayz, it was an ok book but i don't think i would have read it if it wasn't compulsary for school and stuff, so yeah."
5,Magical story,"This is a magical book, a truly inspirational piece of writing from Philip Pullman. It focuses on the life of a young girl named Lyra and her daemon. Lyra leaves the places she knows well and sets out on a journey, not knowing the true purpose of her trip until she is completely caught up in it. The story takes the reader completely into Lyra's world and lets you enjoy the twists of the plot, observing the life of the life of the young heroine as she grows along the way. AND...guess what...there's a sequel!"
5,1 of the best books ever!!!!,"Northern Lights is thrilling and fillied with adventure.Lyra a wild spunky girl sets off on a journet to fid her friend Roger who has dissapeared. She meets witches, armoured bears and many other many magical creatures! This book is def 1 of the best ever!! Be sure to read it!!"
4,A silly story but Eleanor Powell is well worth it,"Forget the story, although there is funny dialogue as well as situations, nice supporting work from Buddy Ebsen and Jimmy Stewart, as well as Una Merkel. Eleanor is a decent, not great, actress, but her fabulous girl-next-door dancing is as sexy as anything on film. The finale with Eleanor is spectacular, as is everything she does. This film is a real gem for lovers of musicals (and Eleanor Powell)."
5,Eleanor Powell's dancing is outstanding!,"Just burned this movie to DVD off the TCM channel - had not seen the film in a number of years. Out of curiosity I was reading the Amazon reviews, and must protest against the one written by Maliejandra - please ignore this post - Powell was a sensational dancer (and one of the best female 'hoofers' in the movies of the time, if not all time?) - don't miss her movies (not that many were made); of course, in the Depression era of the '30s, the reasons for making movies were quite different from now, so avoid trying to get involved in 'stories & plots' - enjoy the music, dancing, and the entertainment - that's what these were made for at that time - if you cannot 'beam back' to the 1930s, then just avoid these films."
4,Jimmy Stewart sings?!,Yes. That's right. He uses his own voice too and does it quite well. I like this picture a lot.
5,Invaluable aid to small animal practice!,The only drawback in this excellant series of books is the long interval between volumes.There should be an on-line site for these books to alow regular udates of new practices and proceedures.
2,Not so good,"This could have been good IF the segments were broken up so that you could go each one separately by fast forwarding or (reversing). The techniques were probably worth watching but it all ran together with no possibility of going back or forward to review. Not a ""keeper"" for sure."
1,Good to watch once and then pass it on...,"This movie had no menus to skip ahead or back...a very primitive DVD...but it DID have some good info...but really, the book has it too...and since i bought both, i could have done without the DVD...(and the cost)"
3,Great Intro to Tribal,"This is a great intro video to tribla belly dance, read about it before you buy this or you'll be very confused, but worth a watch. Tribal has a lot of expressive arms - lots of same movements as ""regular"" belly dance, but if you're looking for something different and interesting.........go for it. I don't watch most DVD's more than once unless they're instructional, but I'm going to refer to this one over and over."
2,Way small,"This monkey puppet is a lot smaller then they make it look in the picture. I bought it for my nine year old for her birthday, but I am afraid she will be disappointed since it would be a better size for maybe a three year old. Not worth the money."
2,My kid can't play with it,"This Monkey puppet is adorable, and it makes my 1 year old crack up laughing every time I put it on my hand. Unfortunately, the thing sheds worse than a real monkey (I imagine, anyway, I'm not sure if real monkeys actually shed). The fur falls out so easily that it's impossible to play with it without getting clumps of fur on your hand. If I let my baby play with it he would destroy it in no time. Even when I use the puppet to entertain him, he loves it, but then he wants to grab it, and clumps of fur are everywhere. It's too fragile of a toy, so it mainly just sits on his dresser and never gets played with."
3,Can't operate mouth - my hand is too big,"This puppet is very cute and soft, but it is very difficult to operate the mouth. I am a woman with medium size hands. To operate the mouth, I have to stick my index and middle fingers into the top and bottom of the mouth and then wiggle them around. It's difficult to get this monkey to talk! The arms work very well in comparison. I decided to return it and buy a different puppet, because a movable mouth was a priority for me when choosing a puppet. Otherwise, I could just get a stuffed animal and wave his arms around."
5,Wow -- their monkeys behave!,"Just to show how much imagination is in a good stuffed toy puppet...The two other reviews use their monkeys to educate and help get the kids to behave. Funny; I collect monkeys and this particular little guy is the biggest troublemaker we've got! Ours is lifelike enough that I've come home only to find our monkey swinging from the chandelier, or sacked out on the sofa eating all of our bananas.Regardless, this is a wonderful toy. Everyone responds positively to this little creature. Actually, that's true of just about all of Folkmanis' puppets. I haven't found one that isn't delightful."
5,Incredibly expressive-best puppet ever!,I have been a teacher of preschoolers for over 20 years(special needs for the past 14 years) and have had a variety of puppets but this one (he is CoCo in Ms. Pam's Playschool) is sooooo real. He comes out just to teach specific preacademic skills and attention is riveted on him. Even I sometimes forget he isn't real! I would get another one but I am concerned with sibling rivalry since CoCo is just getting adjusted here!
1,Cheap quality,"The muffler material is very brittle, if you try to expand the inlet and outlet for the pipes to fit in it will crack.. overtime the muffler case will crack and this muffler will rust from the inside out. spend a little more and get the magna flows with the better material.. Don't cheap out on the muffler unless you plan on selling your car within a couple years.."
4,It Works!,When I first looked at the plastic parts in this kit (before removing them from the sprues that held them fast) I thought that I probably had a 50/50 chance of getting the gearbox to work. I followed the directions and the thing worked on the first try! Kudos to Tamiya! The final product is a bit noisy in operation (it's no timepiece). If you want to change gear ratios after you've constructed the gearbox you'll have to take most of the thing apart and rearrange the gears according to the instructions included in the kit--there is no adjust in place option.
2,Not clear like the picture shows,"I bought this for a friend and anyone who looks at it has a hard time seeing what it is because of the clarity,it is not as sharo as the picture shows."
2,"Disappointed, unfortunately.","While the reviews of this DVD assured me that my money would be well spent, I found it to be extremely vague and generally uninformative. The only thing noteworthy in the video was the diagram representing the necessary balance of impulsion, straightness, etc. and it's importance to be successful. Overall, I found the DVD disappointing and will be selling it used."
5,Great training video...inspiring!,"I thought this DVD was really amazing: informative yet fast-moving. It was a great way to get a behind-the-scenes look at how top riders/trainers work through the training process. I bought it, watched it and have passed it on to my riding partners. I hope I get it back soon so I can watch again!"
5,Superb!!!,This was a beautifully written book. The prose was very touching. I really hatedwhen in ended. If all writers could express themselves this well.....
2,Waste of My Time,"After reading ""Timbuktu Chronicles: Aida and the Chosen Soldier,"" I was ready for another equally unique and interesting book, so I believed a Nobel Prize winning book, ""Wandering Star,"" would be a good bet. But that did not happen. Set around the founding of Israel, I found the book quite boring senseless, dull. Perhaps that is the nature of Noble Prize books, but it was a complete waste of my time. I had to struggle to finish it and did not really see a point to it all. There seemed to be no clear plot. But again, I am a subjective reader, and some may actually find the book interesting."
3,wandering star,"Might benefit from more editing. There are several inconsistencies in the story line. Over all, very interesting and insightful. Enjoyable reading. Will be reading more of his work in the future."
5,Unbelievably Cool,This band rocks every proverbial world that exists in every dimension of all the universes everywhere.
4,It's Good If It Grooves,"Two Ton Shoe is one of those artists whose music takes over your body before you even realize it has invaded your bloodstream. Listen to songs like ""Medicine"" (from the band's eponymously titled debut) or ""Far From Blue"" (from the sophomore effort, Figures), look down and your body's movement should answer the question quite nicely. Simply put, if you ain't groovin', then you ain't listenin'. Two Ton Shoe can rock out with the best of 'em, while sliding through its songs on rock-solid rhythms and silky-smooth grooves. This is rhythm & groove rock and roll at its very finest."
1,pedal cars vol.2,"Lousy,only fore the beginner,light on test,very poor photos,poor quality paper,amature photo shots taken by collectors NOT photographers! Could be a lot better,what is Vol.5 like? i would like to order then review this. Seen JUVENILE AUTOMOBILES A Pictorial Histroy of Children's Pedal & Powered Vehicles both Vols.1 and 2 are excellent! by Apollo Press.UK DO YOU HAVE THESE IN STOCK can you get them for me?"
4,Has several worth-trying projects,"The best things in this book are probably the invitations, tiara, choker, albums, and shoe decorations. They look pretty cool, seem easy to make, and relatively inexpensive. A lot of the other ideas in here seem a bit on the cheesy side which is not my style (wind-up toys dressed as bride and groom? sounds like a waste of money). Diagrams are clear but I wish that there were finished measurements on some pieces (like how wide is the choker and what width headband did they use for tiara?). I recommend checking this out from the library vs. purchasing."
4,Not just for brides,"This book is not just for brides, it is for all creative types. i bought this when my sister was getting married so that I could assist her since I am the artsy one in the family. I ended up making her a Guest-book that is shown in the book and she loved it.You can use several of the ideas in here for several different party occassions."
5,Zino Davidoff after shave,"Good. Order received on time, and exactly what was ordered. The price was competitive. Every purchase on the Internet should be this simple."
5,The best kept secret,"I have mid to waist length hair and sometimes I don't want a pony tail or to spend 2 hours with a blow dryer and a brush. This iron is the best thing ever. I wish I would have found it years ago. It works great. Never any tangles, my hair dryes twice as fast and feels like I just left the salon. I could never get the round brush thing down. But now I don't too. After telling my friend about it , she went a bought one. She used it with her short hair. works great. If your even thinking about it, think no more and get it. You willwish you had it years ago."
4,"A ""must have"" for the serious Java professional","As a pre-publication reviewer, I can assure you that Richard does an excellent job of covering the mechanics of EJB. In addition he gives good advice on advanced topics such as design patterns and implementation strategies.Although best practices for EJB are still evolving, Richard's contribution will certainly advance the art of EJB development.This is a ""must have"" for the serious Java professional."
2,"weak writing, worse thinking","This is one of the first O'Reilly books I've been disappointed with. It's a bit hard to put a finger on exactly why this book leaves one dry, but I suppose I would say that the book simply does not communicate well with the reader. The writing style is average (at best), explanations are superficial, and the code examples are consistently unfocused. The author just does not strike me as a born writer. Unfortunately, there are not many books on this subject, but I for one look forward to the time when some better writers step up and explain EJB technology in a more consise and engaging manner."
4,A good primer,The book is a thorough primer on the complexity of Enterprise Java Beans. The examples are easy to follow and cover a good variety of implementations. Maddog recommends this book to all who are looking for a good introduction to EJBs. Arrrrrrrrr!
5,Excellent introduction to EJB,"It is obvious that much editing went into this book. It is clear, concise, and contains few errors. Although it is 'short' compared to other technical tomes, it does not short-change the topic covered. I wish all technical books were of this quality.This book provides an excellent overview to what Enterprise JavaBeans are and then goes into details on how to use them. If all you need is an high-level understanding of EJBs, chapters 1-3 are for you. If you will be developing EJBs read chapters 1-9.You do need prior experience with Java and JDBC to get the most out of the examples. The provided diagrams are effective, I just would have liked seeing a few more at the point when new concepts are being presented.This will be a book I will continue to reference as I develop EJBs."
3,Good intro but lacks depth,This book isn't a bad introduction to the topic. However if your looking for depth I would suggest you look elsewhere. For senior developers looking to tackle real world problems their's not enough here to really get you going.
2,Save your money,"If you really want to ""MASTER"" EJB then buy 'Mastering Enterprise JavaBeans' by Ed Roman. Its a lot better with complete REAL world examples (there are 13 commercial level beans included with the book). The O'Reilly book does not explain the concepts clearly and is also lacking in examples. Ed Romans' book is the best book on EJB you can find on the market and is truely a masterpiece. If you are going to uy just one EJB book I would recomment Ed Roman's book. It also covers advanced topics like RMI over IIOP..."
5,Great book for getting started on EJBs,I was totally confused about EJBs before I read the book. Thank god I found it and it gave a good head start on all the server side java concepts like java RMI and EJB
5,The best,"It is an excellent book. It has helped me a lot and also saved my time. There is no other resource that describes the EJB concepts in such an elegant and deep manner. I almost have all EJB materials ( books and articles ), but this one is a great exception. I like its way for explaining ""why"" more than ""how"", where EJB is based more on concept rather than coding. This book has a clear presentation of many concepts in EJB programming as well. The part of ""Design Strategies"" presents so valuable design issues for architects and developers to clarify understanding of EJB-based applications. I hope the author expands that part in next release. I always refer this book to my fellows and get appreciated feedback from them. Finally, thanks to the author"
5,great for a solid understanding of EJBs,"I am currently doing EJB development using the BEA server and have found this book a necessity. He does a good job of tackling the different types of EJBs in a step by step approach, having each chapter and example build on top of the other. I found the explanations of the examples through and understandable.The second and third chapters are difficult to get thru, since they are not so hands on, but that understanding helped me in acquiring the better understanding that more questioning (or even more performance driven) engineers will want."
3,Too little info,"Not sufficiently comprehensive. It is a short guide for when your traveling on the rush. Venice is about ease and relaxation. If you don't have the time or patience, you'll be in trouble. And this book won't help much."
5,Great to carry on the go,"My wife and I love the Top 10 series. We always buy a Frommers or Rick Steves book for the trip's planning, but the Top 10 is a must for the trip itself. It'll fit in a pocket (a long one), and will provide quick and easy references to the most important sights, as well as maps and public transportation routes."
3,Noisy!,"This is fun for kids who have the whole Thomas set-up, but that is not my son. It sometimes doesn't push the trains where it's supposed to, and the whiny noise is pretty annoying if you are in ear-shot."
3,More like an overview...,"Since this book is very expensive and popular I was expecting a lot from it. I thought that it would teach me something valuable or new but I only found some good pictures. The text is too simple, too short. The different topics are developed too fast. I think that this one is only good for beginners. If you're already a good pastellist you don't need to spend so much money on that one. So, I don't think this is a collector item.4 stars for the pictures, 2 and a half stars for the text."
3,Just okay,Though an older book the same rules still apply. I have only a few Pastel books. The Daniel Greene book is good.
4,A True-life Spy Thriller,"An excellent blow-by-blow accounting of Mordechai Vanunu, the man who spilled the secrets of Israel's nuclear weapons program to further peace.""Triple Cross"" reads like a spy novel. It's all here -- the idealist hero, a super-secret nuclear factory, globe-hopping travel, the secret service sworn to bring the ""traitor"" in, and a beautiful foil who seduces him on a British street corner and lures him to Rome and his awaiting fate.Was Mordechai Vanunu right to do what he did? Was Israel right to kidnap him on another country's soil? This books leaves you with more questions than it answers"
1,Boring,"I had hoped to see more than just a crew of people standing around waiting for something to happen. There were lots of close-ups of ""ghost hunting equipment"" doing nothing. People talking to the air with no responses, recounting of being poked while trying to sleep - typical. In the last few seconds, a door slammed. OK. The historical facts as told by the hotel staff were interesting, but other than that, nothing new was brought to light by this documentary. It would have been nice if they had included a bit about Stephen King's stay, but no. It wasn't scary or even fascinating, it was extremely dull and a total waste of money. The ""Ghosthunters"" TV show version was much better than this."
1,Bad Connection,Poor connection and I would like my money back. Wasnt what I I was expecting at all. Ghost hunters isnt what i wanted to watch
1,Boring,OMG this movie was so boring it made me envy the dead! I felt like I was in high-school all over again!
3,Psychics?,I have seen many TV programs about this psychic abilities. I must say that I am skeptical about the method and the type of psychic ability that these psychics profess to have. What is psychic ability anyhow? Is psychic ability the divination of information using supernatural methods or is it the ability to foresee events in the real world? I am still a skeptic about this ability and this set of DVD's claims that some psychics can solve crimes with their abilities and others can prevent bad events from taking place.
4,Terrific second effort.,"Tomas Bodin's Pinup Guru is a terrific follow up to the equally outstanding Ordinary Night... Unlike his first recording this is a trio recording with Jonas Reingold on bass and Zoltan Csorsz on drums. These three Flower Kings bandmates play brilliantly together. As with the FK's recent release, Unfold the Future, there are jazzy flavorings throughout but it is still clearly a prog effort. The interplay between these three musicians is just incredible. Bodin's compositional skills are clever, creative and imaginative. This is an instrumental recording with nothing but keyboards, bass and drums to hold one's interest. It does so admirably. Tomas Bodin is well in the ranks of Wakeman, Emerson and Banks. His ability to explore new sounds and directions is reminiscent of his forebearers but he is certainly a unique keyboardist within his own right. I look forward to what is to come in the future. This one is well worth purchasing...Simon"
2,Great figures; terrible production values.,"These figures are, clearly, for the advanced intermediate and very experienced origamist. They are clever, and many have very detailed (and many) steps.However, the main reason I rated the book rather low is that the figures are very hard to see since they are printed in a very dark ink, and the instructions are, in many instances, almost impossible to see. It would have helped greatly if the diagrams were not printed so darkly -- indeed, the sample pages given when ordering are NOT what is seen. Also, it would have helped if there were some sugggestions as to size of paper with which to begin.I suspect that very experienced folders will play with the models and will be successful, but I also think these great figures would have been much more accessible -- as they should be as they are really good -- had the authors or publishers used a bit more care in what the end book would look like vis-a-vis the diagrams."
4,elegant and beautiful models,"Origami is a beautiful kind of art , which I view as analogous to music. Similar to music, origami books are like notes that each performer may interpret in his unique way. With this analogy, Montroll, for me, is the origami Bach, while Lang is the origami Rachmaninoff. After some bad experience with other designers, until recently, I only ""played"" Montroll's and Lang's models, however when my son insisted he wants also models of witches and warriors, I agreed to buy this book, and I do not regret. The models of the witch, dragon with warrior, and lady, are in my opinion masterpieces. They are very elegant, and relatively easy for an experienced folder. The only reason I rate this book as 4 star and not 5 is because the instructions are not as clear as in Montroll's books and there are some minor errors in the diagrams."
3,Good for advanced origami,Our 11 year old grandson (and us) have a some trouble getting started on a number of the origami figures. It could use a little more detail on some of the figures.
4,Really cool+fun+hard= a great game,This game is one of my top 5 GBA video games! I think episode1 is the best part of all. Episode 3 is the worst becuse i alwaysloose. Episode 2 is just fun. It's great becuse it really feelslike you're really in a video game and it's just like the starwars movies. But the coolest level is the naboo forest becusethe setting looks REALLY real. I think this game is reallycool.
4,Kids love Lego Star Wars,This game is very good. My 9 yr. old loves Legos and Star Wars so this was a great match up! The instruction book was good also. I would highly recommend this game for this age group.
5,THE FUNNEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!,"I love this game. The episode three game is the best. I can spend hours playing this. This game is not to hard, and I'm about 8 years old. Another good thing about it is that there are no violent parts that I have seen so far."
4,Game is good although ...,I bought this game for my 2 boys age 5 and 7. They enjoy it but say it is a bit challenging and enjoy the Star Wars II game better.One reason why I think they say it is challenging is because Amazon sent a version that is in another language.WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? It is German? or something. Can't distinguish which language.
5,All Three Episodes in One Action-Packed Game,"I recently purchased this game for my 6-year-old son, and he loves it. The game allows him to choose adventures from Episodes I,II, and III. In Episode I, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are pitted in a fierce battle with alien droids. Episode II finds Anakin fighting the scary Tuskin Raiders. Finally, Episode III pits Anakin and Obi-Wan together. This time they're fighting the Separatists aboard General Grievous' ship.This is a very fun and action-packed game. My son prefers it to the Star Wars Episode III game pack. The graphics are excellent, and the official Star Wars music plays in the background while the player is slugging it out on the screen. I recommend this game very highly. Having three different episodes included in one game is a great deal, and each one is loads of fun. Purchase this game and enter into the world of Star Wars."
4,This Game is Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have alot of fun playing this game! It is so fun i haven't put it down for a month!!! It is challenging but perfect for little kids. When you ""kill"" someone, they just collaspe into a bunch of legos. The freeplay mode is useful and encourages kids to replay levels. The 23 caracters all are useful for defeating bosses. The various levels allow you to save up ""credits"" to buy more caracters. I suggest buying Darth Maul; he is far superior to anyone at jumping, except for Jar-Jar of course. I've already have allmost every the caracters thanks to the freeplay mode. Lego:Star Wars is sold at Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Circuit City, and pretty much every major store thay sale video games.I suggest you buy it!!!"
5,This is a GREAT GAME!,"This game is FUN! I love it! If you like LEGO's or Star Wars, this is the game for you.Oh! And on the first level, if you use The Force on the chairs, they dance to the Cantina music! :)"
2,Too short and gets old FAST,"I'll make this short, I BEAT THIS GAME THE SAME DAY I GOT IT. It barley covers episodes I, II and III, note how on the description it says that the game covers the most exciting and memorable scenes from all three movies? WELL THAT'S ALL THEY GIVE YOU! The day after i got it it was still kinda fun but then i played it a little more and it just got plain BORING.DON'T make the same mistake I did. I would rather save my money and buy actual legos or a different game."
2,"nice idea, but doesn't pan out","Here's my problem with this book: It's 303 pages long and Andy and Tony don't meet until page 229! They don't have any significant interaction until page 271 and they don't have any intimate contact until page 298. I liked the idea of two people wounded by the mistreatment of their SOs but there's just too much filler before they get together. I wanted to see the part where they healed each other. If you want a sweet romance where the men meet right off the bat (and a good suspense story too), try The Magic of Your Touch by Sara Bell"
2,Is that all there is?,"I was disappointed with this book, and disappointed with some of the reviews found here. Yet, the book had definite possibilities and was interesting; but all the time I was wondering when Andy and Tony were going to meet, let alone get into bed together. It seemed to me that much could have been edited, so that we could have got to the point and had some development of the main characters and their relationship, which does not come until the last pages of the book. I also felt that the attack by Andy's homophobic boss was unrealistic; any employer today would be more discreet for fear of being hit with a lawsuit. What did happen after Andy and Tony spent one night together? I wish I knew."
3,Flying With Angels,"The author has a talent for writing, and I found the story interesting. However, it is very poorly edited, which almost spoiled the story for me. There are several spelling errors and grammatical mistakes. There are also several factual errors, perhaps because the author is Canadian and is not familiar with every aspect of American life. A good editor would have caught them. For example, Gerry's maid is Puerto Rican, and Andy says that he is going to help her get her citizenship. However, Puerto Ricans are citizens, and while it's possible for her to be Puerto Rican, Mexican or Ecuadoran would have been more believable choices. Also, New Yorkers drive on expressways or parkways, not freeways. It's also odd that Andy doesn't have a cell phone or blackberry. I assume there was a hardcover edition before this paperback, so either these errors found their way into the paperback edition, or nobody ever noticed these errors in the printed copy."
4,Well made,"Just wanted to leave a quick note regarding the fonts used. I was a bit worried because a previous reviewer said that the blocks used Latin fonts to mimic Russian letters. Now that I have these blocks in my hands, I would say I disagree. The letters are normal Russian letters - although it's not the smoothest font, I think that that's because of the limitations of carving straight angles into the wood. In the end, the letters are clear and easy to read and correct Russian letters which is what I've wanted for my little one.The overall quality is also very good. I am generally not big on wooden blocks - they always look so bland next to the brighter plastic toys - but for what it is, they are very well made. The size is medium... a bit big for my two-year old's hands but will be ideal for 3-year olds and older. I also think they look a bit better than the photo... the picture makes the letters look fuzzy but they are actually quite sharp."
4,Great for my bi-lingual daughter!,I knocked one star off just because they are not really all that colorful. Brighter colors attract toddlers so much more. But they are as advertised. Nicely crafted durable blocks. My 17mo likes them.
5,Perfect!,"Perfect, my Russian husband loves them as much as my daughter. Great quality and ironically we didn't see anything as nice when we were in Moscow in October."
4,Better than average Bunuel,"In watching Bunuel, one has to accept the inevitable disconnectedness of surrealism. By providing us with the 'spine' of the two travelers' pilgrimage, the movie has continuity while still allowing the director a free hand for his precociousness. The result is a lot of separate stories, ideas, delightful silliness, and surprises that keep the viewer involved and challenged, but not confused. This is one of the better Bunuel films in my opinion. In addition, the print and color were exceptional, except in a few washed out clips. Finally, the extras were adequate, which is more than I can say for most of the Bunuel offerings I've purchased."
3,An odd stream of consciousness.,"This was *way* less interesting than some of Bunuel's other work. His ""Phantom of Liberty"" is brilliant, for instance. He's obsessed, in this film, with some of the nuances of Catholicism. Your enjoyment of this film will be roughly in proportion to your leve of interest in religious philosophy. If you're not interested in religious philosophy, take a pass."
2,A satirical look at Roman Catholic doctrine,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""The Milky Way"" released in France as ""La Voie lactée"" is directed by Luis Buñuel and is about two men on a pilgrimage to a city in Spain. The film is a satire on various tenets of Catholicism and miracles associated with it. The film depicts Marian apparitions, Stigmatics, and other scenes.This film is likely to offend Christians but Catholics far more so than Protestants. Being a Protestant myself who strongly disagrees with Catholic doctrine, I found this film to be interesting.The film has some interesting supplements too. They are ""Luis Buñuel: Atheist Thanks to God"" a documentary about Buñuel's life and the film, an introduction by co-writer Jean-Claude Carrière, an interview with, Ian Christie, and a theatrical trailer.Not for everyone but still interesting."
3,Nice book but not for me,"When I read the title of this book, I expected to learn more basic stitch work around cabachons.I really wanted to learn how to do a simple peyote stitch around a cabachon but that is not includedin this book. What is included are some very beautiful projects and creative beadwork stitches to use foredging. The fringe work is fantastic and the author is both artistic and creative. Perhaps this book was abit too high end for a beginner."
4,Great for only cabochon jewelry,"This book often gets recommended with ""The Art of Bead Embroidery"" but they really are two different books. ""The Art of Bead Embroidery"" incorporates cabochons into the designs a lot and they are often the focal point, but it also uses a lot of different types of beads and stones as well into the creations. This is pretty much just bezelling cabochons and adding some fringe. Don't get me wrong... it gives you lots of creative ideas on how to do that and is a fabulous reference for that type of work... but it's a much narrower scope than ""The Art of Bead Embroidery"" is. Based on other reviews I bought this book thinking it was the same type of work as ""The Art of Bead Embroidery"" is. They are not. Great for what it is... just be aware of what that is."
5,Beading with Cabochons: Simple Techniques Beautiful Jewelry,I would recommend this book to anyone. I love this book. Great easy to follow instructions and wonderful pictures and examples ...
5,Wow,"Great photos, great instruction and techniques.....and easy to follow. Well thought out book. Once you have these techniques you can create so much. thank you"
4,Beading with Cabochons Book,"This book was described as new. The ""Beading with Cabochons"" book brand new has a dust cover. There was none. The corners were somwhat bent. However, the book was still worth the price I paid."
4,Great Cabachon Basics,"I found this book to have a great variety of techniques to embelish your basic beaded cabochon. I did not really care for the technique the author used to actually hold down the cabachon. I don't feel it is quite as sturdy as I would like. There are beautiful photos to help inspire your own pieces. I think this would make a good book for someone who is around beginner level in bead embroderiy, but has some knowlege of basic bead stitches."
5,The best book about beading with cabochons on the market!,"I searched every bead store I went to looking for information about beading around cabochons. I came across this book about three months ago. It's very detailed and great for the beginner. I'm very pleased with the book - it should be in every beginner seed beader's library. Even those of you who've been beading for a while, should check this book out. It has wonderful, colorful graphics, and easy steps to follow. Since I got this book, I've beaded around 30 cabochons!"
5,Salon Quality Fast Dry,"So, I hate doing my nails at home because I don't have the patience for them to dry, but Essie Good to Go made my nails dry in 60-90 secs and they lasted longer than any salon manicure I've had--a full 3 days before I started seeing signs of wear!! Great must-have product!"
2,"RAW, SHOCKING, OVER THE TOP","A paranoid nightmare is at he heart of FREEZE FRAME (First Look). Sean Veil (Lee Evans) is a man falsely accused of the brutal murder of a mother and her two daughters.Held then released without a conviction, Veil is so shaken he decides to videotape every minute of his life as future insurance against another false conviction. He even makes a chest harness and attaches a small video camera aimed at his head when he's out and about.But when Veil is a suspect in another murder, he discovers the tapes that could prove his innocence are missing. This raw, highly stylized first feature reminded me of ""Pi"" and ""Memento."""
3,a little science-fiction?,The many years going through life with a camera on at all times seems a little far out.
2,Don't buy it here...,"Just had to put this on here, great movie, dodgy copy sold to me by Amazon. I recieved a screener, not suitable for sale, every 15 minutes or so the picture goes grey and a message stating the film is not for sale is displayed on the screen for several minutes. Not impressed."
3,Freeze Frame,"I thought this was a good film, although I agree that it is a slow starter. I think it is worth viewing for Evans performance alone. We are so used to his self proclaimed 'monkey man' antics and this is such a departure from that 'role' for him. It has an OK ending and the premise is quite good although not brilliantly executed. I'd say it's worth a viewing and being your own judge.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,Less than I had hoped for...,"Throughout my years in the social services I have worked with (and hopefully helped) several victims of CFIDS. It is a genuine issue that has, unfortunately, been largely ignored by the mass media.Sadly, I was disappointed to find that Ms. Schlosser's book seems little more than a discussion of issues which seem irrelevent to the true matters behind CFIDS, and at certain points I wondered whether the author does indeed suffer from the affliction.Readers and the general public should know that CFIDS is a very relevant issue. Schlosser's book does little to aid in this cause."
1,Needs more info,"Although I feel for Ms. Schlosser and her affliction, I was looking for more 'meat' instead of fluff. Sometimes the book started to talk about substantive issues, and other times it would break down to a series of tangents that made it impossible to follow.I do not doubt the severity of her illness, but I wondered sometimes if it was exaggerated for effect."
4,Excellent for the average sewer.,"The idea of the thread cartridge seems great, but I'm a quilter. I never use regular spools of thread. To use the cartridge with a cone of thread, I had to do some major rigging. The instructions are there to do it, but the attachment I had to use (which came with it) created a rather precarious setup to be using it every day. I am selling CS-80, but I'm buying a CS-6000i. I was VERY happy with brand, the way the bobbin works and winds (for the average user) and all the accessories it comes with, so I was happy to see the cs-6000i has a lot of the same things going on. Make SURE you use the right bobbin or it will NOT sew right and it'll seem there's something VERY wrong with the machine and there's not. I love the speed of this machine. I also loved the needle lifter and 3-speed setting. I highly recommend it for the average sewer."
3,The machine is just alright,"The machine is great for quilting and everyday uses.The stitches used for quilting are tight. The decorative stitches really bring together your work. If you are trying to do upholstery or thicker than usual fabrics, I would look to another type of machine. The machine jams up, and the heavy duty thread unravels on the bobbin and causes poor stitches."
5,Just what I wanted!,"My mother has a Viking sewing machine, and I have used hers for a couple years off and on when I had a sewing project. Recentally I got into quilting and her machine wasn't available as often as I needed it, so I purchased this one. It was at the bottom of the line for price, but had all the options I really wanted. I thought for a beginners machine why not, I can always save up for a ""better"" machine while using this one. After using it, I changed my mind. It works great, and sometimes my mom even uses it because it has more options then her $1200 machine! I think I'll stick with this one! HAPPY SEWING!"
4,Get for some stuff..,"I love this machine, but don't expect to repair a ripped knee in jeans or make a thick quilt with this one.I have made a few blankets and even using thin material its hard to get through 4 layers when hemming a corner. with the design of the machine you cant get to a pants knee. Its great for basic stuff and making a cute stitch on things.I love the self threading feature! But the first few times threading, refilling a bobbin and some other few things i had to reread the instructions which was a bit over whelming at first. Once you have it figured out its great! I would say if you are just sewing basic material its well worth the money. I have had mine for a few years now and no troubles so far."
3,Great when it works,"I've only had this machine for a few years, with very light use, and already the bobbin winder has stopped working. In addition, no matter what I do or what methods I try, this machine will not sew properly using invisible nylon thread, and it has some significant problems with thicker materials. Other than that, it's great - thus my title: Great when it works"
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,"This pattern is the China pattern I picked to register for when I was married, so I have 10 other settings and know what they are SUPPOSE to look like. The two that I ordered from Amazon were a joke!!!! Everything was fine- EXCEPT the DINNER plate(which is the most used piece) in both boxes was a TOTALY DIFFERENT PATTERN!!!!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSE TO LOOK LIKE- they had green in them!!! BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!"
2,Eco?,i dont really see what' s Eco to this toothbrush as it seems all plastic to me including the brush fibers.
4,"Good product, good price, great shipping.","Very nice light for a very reasonable price, packed well, shipped fast -what is not to like?"
2,Know Why The Price Is So Low?,"My initial thought when I first opened the box was that this light is cheap looking. However, once I got it hung and the globes added, I love it. It is light weight and works well with a dimmer switch."
4,Good for therapy,It is difficult to rate for the long term as I gave it to someone after using it. It was very helpful in a therapeutic setting. The turtle was very good for demonstrating protection to a child.
1,"Eye Candy Cover, but impossible to read.","Unless you are desperate for a book of this subject, this book is a waste of time and money. It has a very unrealistic plot (I realize many of this genre do, and this is no exception), and the writing is horrible. It reads as if the authour either wrote it in a foriegn language and then had someone try to translate it, or he tried to write in a language he was not fully fluent in. This book has limited appeal."
2,Boring and Short,Very short and rather average book. My child does not seem to enjoy it and it totally bored by it. Try Sandra Boynton for a fun time for kids and parents!
2,Talented musicians,"Well, for each listener there is an album that really ""nails"" it. However, on this one, the only track that I can recommend is the first one called ""Tibetan Moon"". Ben Lobst's excellent work with the singing bowls reaches deeply into the mind and consciousness and is hypnotic and powerful.As for ""Siesta"", and ""Rivers of Zimbabwe"", I found them limpid and way too long overall, unfortunately. The final song ""Affinity"" has the zither, and peruvian quena flute that bring some interest to the violin and fretless bass. To me, the album feels unfinished and I have a sense of waiting to hear the rest of their message or perhaps a direction for the music. On the other hand, perhaps, for its proposed use in hypnotherapy, that is exactly what they wished to put forth."
1,polished all to well,"This book is written very well, but please, don't be fooled by the conclusions drawn in this book. What we have here is questionable facts, even more questionable conclusions drawn from those ""facts"" and a very biased author. Read the book if you like, but it is all to easy to get lulled into this revisionist peice of crap. If you do read it, I strongly recommend you also read Iris Chang's ""The Rape of Nanking : The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II"" or a first hand diary such as "" The Good Man of Nanking: The Diaries of John Rabe""The Good Man of Nanking: The Diaries of John Rabe"
1,shameless japs,"what worries me a lot is that lots of japs never admit the fact based on history, 300,000 civilian killed by japs in nankin and more people gonna die inevitablely in the future if japs could not even admit the crimes and start another war. shame on you japs, shame on you."
4,A very good book,The book is a pretty balanced view of what happened at Nanking. The author did a very good job of reviewing the facts that exist from all sources. The book presents the information well and is a pretty dramatic and interesting reading. It does not attempt to assign blame it leaves that for the reader.
3,Great book and pictures.,"I didn't consider this as a how-to book in training, but rather a book that is long on 'wow'. I believe that Mr. Hempfling is a great trainer in his own right and I respect that from the contents of the book."
3,competent but not brilliant,"This, her first album in years, is slightly disappointing. An album of pop/disco cover versions and new recordings of her hits Feels Like I'm In Love and Hot Love. Her voice is slightly lower than it used to be and that, somehow, takes the edge of the songs. I feel this could have been a lot better."
2,The book I got is a international version specially for South Asian countries. The quality is not good.,"$68 probably is fine for this international edition printed in India. However, it doesn't have colored charts and the quality is not good too. By the way, the profile pic in Amazon is somewhat misleading because the book cover is different."
2,Worst economic book,"It is true that the authors of this book know what they are talking about. It is not true, however, that they can relay that information to others in an easy to understand manner. Important terms and concepts are lost in numerous mathematical functions. The functions themselves would be somewhat self-explanatory if they had included numerical examples;however, they did not include enough to make the concepts crystal clear. Besides, how many college students can really get into products such as wine and cheese which the author's uses to illustrate a concept in the second chapter. They could have illustrated it much better with the use of beer and pizza. Agreeably, this has to be one of the worst economic textbooks I have read."
3,Your first lesson in International Economics,"Your first lesson in International Economics is to get the international version of this book. It will be softcover, also the 8th edition, and half the price. It will be the same, page for page.Then take the person of your choice out for a nice dinner. You'll be glad you did."
2,Lacks Jan Hammer,"This album takes its theme from the less-inspired fourth season of the show. There's really nothing special on it until the final track, an original composition by Jan Hammer. One day, MCA will release a box-set of Hammer's complete recordings for Miami Vice. We must all keep praying."
3,Phantom of the opera (Karaoke),"I've got the CD six month ago.If you're a phantom fan you might find that the arrangementis different from the origional cast CD. First, the organ sounded bad in the song ""phanotm of the opera"". Secondly, the drumming of ""The phantom of the opera"" is different. The arrangement form ""in all your fantasy"" doesn't fit the mood. If you're the expert of the arrangement you'll notice the difference and you'll probably not used to the mood of that part. Since that part suppose to be a important transition of mood. The key is as same as the origional arrangement. For ""Music of the night"" the beginning is slightly faster than the origional cast one.However, I recommend the guild voice track of the song ""phantom of the opera."" The girl who play Christine sounded great, the guy who plays the phantom is skillful at acting at the very end when he seduce Christine to sing higher and higher."
2,Bad Smell,"The product was just what I was looking for, but when it arrived it had a horrible smell. The odar was so strong I had to leave the bag outside and when i had my patio door open i could still smell it.So I send it back,even the mailman commmended on it.I email the company to see if there was something I could do to take the smell away,but I never heard from them"
2,slips,This strap slips every where and never stays in place. Also the cup doesn't fit right on the bassoon. And the length is really short.
1,Program is too old to work on new operating systems,"My wife loved this program and found it very useful for teaching students. Unfortunately, the software is apparently too old and we could not get it to work even on a Windows XP system and even after getting professional help."
1,It doesn't work with Windows XP and above,"I am truly disappointed. This wonderful and educational software does not work if you have Windows XP or above. I would expect a ""warning"" message in the product description."
5,Can't Believe No One Didn't Bother To Review This Show,"I was hooked to Isaak's genius many years ago, who has created such Great music over the years. The production of this performance is top notch, as is his band the Silvertones. If you miss out on this one, blame no one but yourself. Isaak's voice is haunting, as is his melodies, and lyrics.Way way ahead of his time, this man-and his band, just creating Great music for All of us to enjoy.BUY IT..You won't be disappointed."
5,Beautiful Book!,"I bought this book several years ago, when it first came out. I love it! I have yet to build anything out of cob, but hopefully that will change in the next five years. This is one of the few books I own that I would NEVER consider selling. It is chock full of information, and when I am feeling blue, I whip out the book, page through it, and fantasize about it. If you are thinking of building anything with cob, buy this book!"
1,Love this book!,"This book is an inspiration for sustainable living. It is entertaining and very informative. By mid-point, you'll be ready to get your feet in the mud."
2,Tree Hugging Humbuggery,"I purchased this book based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews in Amazon.com.I was looking for a practical guide on Cob building - not on living according to the new age hippie ethos of the authors.I've read the first few chapters, and there are nuggets of practical advice, but the narration keeps getting bogged down by Ianto Evans digressions on how evil humans keep screwing up the environment.It is my hope that I can finish the book, collect some useful information, and in the end, be satisfied with my purchase. I'm just finding it difficult to wallow through the enlightened philosophy.I will attempt to read it through to the end and perhaps revise my review. I've looked briefly at the sections written by the other two authors (Smith and Smiley) and they both seem, on the surface, to be a little more instructional in their writing, and less interested in teaching me about their new age voodoo."

3,Cobra 200 GTL DX 4-Band 10-Meter Amateur Radio,Nice radio. Stopped transmitting after three months. I returned it under warrantee. Turn around was 10 days. It's been fine since.UPDATE 5/09/08 After 2 trips to warrantee center for repair (NO Transmit) It is dead again and out of warrantee... thanks Cobra for a real piece of crap. This thing has never been mobil and used very little.
1,This is an Abomination,"THIS UNIT AND ALL OTHERS SIMILAR ARE ABOMNIATIONS!Amateur Radio activity in the 10 Meter band (not 32.8 feet) is not channelized! Activity occurs on any frequency within the frequency sub-band in use. Often communications do not even occur on even kilohertz boundaries. Channelized communications only occur in the FM sub-band.Beeps, Echos, and other sound effects are highly frowned upon in the Amateur bands. Use of any of these will brand you as an abomination, the free bander."
4,"Only 28 minutes, but worth every penny!","Although this CD is only 28 minutes long, it truly shows the versatility of the hammered dulcimer and some very impressive playing. Not only is it the major instrument, it appears to be the only instrument, used with hammers, dampners, and by picking. Having a true love of hammered dulcimer, and having built my own instrument, I was particularily impressed with the music on this CD. Unfortunately I can not find the name of the performer or the publisher anywhere, and no details of accompanying instruments or performers are available."
1,"Beware, this does not fit a rodeo","This is listed as fitting a RTodeo, but it has a 4 square not 4 straight connector, and thus this will not fit. Buy the Bosch OE fit."
5,A book for the ages,"I really enjoyed reading Elliot Richardson's insights into government and politics. His book should be mandatory for all those involved in running the government today. The clowns in charge today (from both parties) could learn a great deal from someone who not only has a great deal of experience, but also possesses a great deal of integrity."
2,A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!,This movie is the worst 3D film i have seen since the movie spykids.The movie looks interesting at first but as it gets to the middle it starts to get boring and the 3D is not even as good as the first movie.If you want to see a real screen jumping 3d movie see Haunted Castle 3D or Alien Adventure 3D if not your just wasting 40 minutes of your life on cheap 3D tricks and learning how the eye works.
2,eh....so so,"This is a sequel to ""Encounter in the Third Dimension"", thankfully without Elvira. It goes into more detail about 3D movies than its predecessor, but more is less here. The first movie had far more interesting 3D tidbits. This just seems a bit tired. 3D isn't bad though, and the field-sequential 3D enthusiasts out there should pick it up."
2,Not Recommended,This is boring....nothin comes out at all...only like 2 parts...i like all the action! the first one (Encounter in the Third (thrid) dimension)was way more exciting....i mean it was boring! it had good depth but the effects were horrible....i've seen way better...Depth Rating- 7/10 3D(off screen)- 2/10 overall- 4/10*not recommended
4,Un enregistrement réjouissant,"Nous retrouvons avec plaisir deux formidables musiciens réunis dans ce CD. Pete Christlieb et Bill Watrous ont une longue et belle carrière mais ils n'ont rien perdu de leur enthousiasme et de leurs immenses qualités. Gary Urwin a préparé pour les deux solistes principaux des arrangements efficaces servis par un big band réunissant des musiciens de haute valeur(B.Shew, C.Loper, K.Richmond, W.Luening....). Voilà un CD qui ravira les admirateurs de Chrislieb , de Watrous et ....de Big Band."
5,Lovely,"Bought this as a gift for my husband and he really loved the photo illustrations. They are beautiful. Makes a nice ""coffee table book""."
3,Ironic edition,"I'll not dwell on the author's content but on the publisher's choice of binding. Thoreau calls for a complete abandonment of possessions and to always choose the simpler, less expensive if something is needful. This beautiful coffee table book uses expensive glossy enamel paper with gorgeous photographs going way beyond necessity. Every time I picked it up to read, it's irony struck me first and weighed upon me until I set it down. It's a shame really, because with other content it would be luxurious."
4,Good Start into Kabbalah,"This book includes the adventures into Kabbalah by the author. It's a fun read and somewhat enlightening too. He includes some very simple, yet important Kabbalistic principles. It's light, but a fine introduction (or a nice parallel read with other heavier texts) to Kabbalah. It is not an advanced text or practical, definitive instruction. Enjoy."
1,Piano,"This was the worst Amazon experience of my life. The company contacted me to tell me they did not have the item in the color I wanted and recommended canceling-which I did. They even gave me a confirmation number for the cancelation. Then I ordered the product I wanted from another company. After THAT, Ace digital shipped me the product I did not want. They left it on my sister's doorstep in the pouring rain with no protection. It took weeks and many phone calls -and I might add-NO help from Amazon-before I finally got a refund. Oh-getting the item picked up was a nightmare, too.I was disappointed, to say the least, in Amazon's response when I repeatedly told you what was going on. That fact that Amazon thinks it is okay to get a cancelled item in a color that was not ordered makes me never want to order from Amazon again-you did not back up me, the customer, in the least."
4,Fantastic Karaoke CD!,"This karaoke CD is fantastic! The music is almost JUST LIKE what you hear off of the regular CD, and that very seldom happens on karaoke CD's (or tapes for that matter). I even used this to sing at the new employee talent portion of the Christmas get-together we had this past year, and I am VERY picky about how things sound! (I am TRULY my worst critic!) My only problem with this CD is the fact that there was a song by JoDee Messina on it (not that I don't love JoDee, too, but this is Martina's karaoke! JoDee can have her own karaoke CD in a few more years, and I'll buy that one, too!) Why couldn't they have put a Martina classic on there, such as Cheap Whiskey, Life #9, or The Time Has Come? I personally don't think we have enough of Martina's great songs available on karaoke to wail to!"
1,Reality Show Gone Terrorist,"How far can we take this ""reality"" business? I rented this thinking it was the real thing (and that is how it is marketed). Half-way through this piece of garbage I realize that this is a phony documentary. What a scam!"
1,"Never been angrier at a ""film.""",Any American affected by 911 and the seriousness of the subsequent wars will be offended by this pretentious piece of garbage. Just another film maker who finds war to be an exciting little game played by children. I guess the next move for these filmakers will be to dramatize what it must have been like in the two towers. Maybe they can strap a camera on the back of someone and jump off a building just to get a 'cool' shot. If I were to meet the people responsible for this Jerry Springer inspired trash I would love to accompany them as we visit some of the family members. This call this film a disgrace is giving it too much credit.
1,The Blair Witch Almost Meets Osama Bin Laden,"My advice: don't waste your time or money on this one.If you were expecting a serious treatment of September 11, Afghanistan, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and/or Osama Bin Laden, then you will be utterly disappointed with the September Tapes.On the other hand, if you enjoy excessively dramatized documentaries that ooze with hokey dialog, transparent story lines and bogus sentimentality..."
2,Stupid and pointless,"This are two good things about this movie. First of all, the footage inside Afghanistan. That was great. Second, the DVD feature where they show just how dangerous it was for them to shoot this movie. Everything else was pointless. Why fake being in danger when you really ARE in danger? They could have been killed so many times. Why not make a REAL documentary? And as for their fake documentary, it is so unbelievably stupid. Nobody in their right mind would think this is real. The guy who plays ""Lars"" is a bad actor and the script is just terrible. It starts out being something believable but then it turns into an action movie where Lars becomes Rambo. It's insulting to watch. Do not buy this movie! Rent it! And then just watch the DVD features. Skip the bad movie.It's a real shame these people put their lives on the line and came out with something so stupid."
1,No decency to say it is not a real documentary,"When i got the film i thought it was the real deal.But in the middle of the movie i started to question it really baddly, becouse of the script skeleton, with its turning points and highs and lows. The way the camera man filmed like he was an idiot, .... allways stayin on that larson guy. If u were ther ud film all around not stayin on the ""director"" all the time. Those zooms were awfull, not even in real life does ur finger be so itch and angry with the zoom....The larson guy, shoots at the ""attackers"" with automatic mode -on- , on the kalatch!!!! 5 years in the army and he doesnt know not to shoot with -auto- but with -single-!!!!!....and the ""charging"" !!!! runing instead of crawling!!!! what army was he in? the afgan army? i tell u he looked when he was shooting just like those afgans shoot in the same film! only he wore American Glases.A Big Dissapointment! Big!"
2,YAWN BLAHHH blahhhhh....................................,"Osama, are you in there? Yoohoo Osama, where are you? That'show interesting this phony documentary was! I was really lookingforward to see this, what a joke! A total waste of 90 minutes!After 30 minutes or so, you start rooting for the terrorists."
3,This Is NOT a documentary,"Many, including some above reviewers, did not understand that this is pure fiction. Filmed in Afghanistan, yes. Real, no. It is 100% scripted movie-making.The footage is gritty and realistic and it does suck you in with its downward suicidal spiral. But it runs a little long and the ending is obvious long before we get there.They would have done better to have made a real documentary."
1,You people can't be this stupid,"I sincerely hope the reviewers on here who believe this is truly a documentary are kidding. This thing is a joke and total garbage. It's nothing more than bad acting shot in a desert. The lead actor (documentarian) who is supposed to be from New York, often lets slip a hint of his British accent. Come on, people. Wake up!"
1,"Words fail me, but I'll try...",The film presents itself as a documentary but it isn't. The main characters in it are actors using 9/11 and the war in Afghanistan for their own profit. I feel bad that they duped actual Afghani officials into helping them get this trash brought to the screen and I feel bad for people who are duped into thinking this is real. Waste of time.
1,BAD,"Do not watch this - it is horrible. Extremely offensive and dangerous! It is all fake! I cannot believe someone made a fake documentary and sold it as a true story of a man fighting because the terrorists killed his wife - if I want to see that I can watch an Arnold Schwarzeneggar movie that I know is pretend, but this beats it all. It plays on your emotions and then you find out its not real. COMPLETE BULLS***!"
1,Easily the worst movie I've ever seen.,"If I could give this ZERO stars I would. It's rah-rah America so over the top that I would have been happy to climb into the movie and machine gun all the idiotic Americans myself. It's offensive beyond belief (the main character's wife was supposedly killed in the Twin Towers on 9/11 - pretty offensive to all of those people who had family who DID lose their lives on 9/11). The acting is atrocious, the characters are morons, and the movie has no point at all.Once I'd watched it, I actually snapped the DVD in half and threw it in the garbage. Dreadful. Don't waste your money. There are many other war movies that are 100 times better than this. Watch THREE KINGS and see a movie that truly shows the horrors of war and terrorism in the Middle East."
2,Can You Say Cheese in Arabic?,"I found it amusing how this ""documentary"" filming seem to catch every tense moment and fighting episode so perfectly - being just in the right place just at the right time....which makes this movie's unwilling confession scream out ""VELVEETA!!"" - about as fakey-cheesey as it comes. The first 30 minutes of the film I thought was well done, but then the story line & filming deteriorated into a bad con-man's ploy that left me humuourously thinking ""are you serious?"". It made me think Rambo got lost in the Blair Witch Project."
3,FAKE DOCUMENTARY LOOKS REAL AND SCARY,"Although it looks and feels like a documentary, SEPTEMBER TAPES (First Look) is an unsettling movie that purports to be a quest to find the truth about the terrorist attack of 9/11 and those responsible.A year after September, 2001, three men with fake documents go deep into Afghanistan. With the help of hired translators, bounty hunters and arms traffickers, they find answers to questions they weren't even asking.Slow going and talky at times, the sudden and surprisingly visceral action scenes jolt and are greatly enhanced by the harrowing location filming and the terrific surround sound design. Extras include 40 minutes of bonus footage and commentaries.Too bad more attention wasn't paid to making the script as gripping as some of the action cinemtography. It could've been unforgettable."
2,bad acting and script,"Although the movie is a fake documentary, the beginning 10 minutes resemble real life. Thereafter, bad acting and poorly written script are noticeable. All the fighting scenes were creating in India and not afghanistan. During the RPG firing and get away shooting, I saw posters of ""Oxford coaching institute"" painted on the walls in hindi (The director needs to pay attention to details).I wish the movie could have shown the real scenes from Dan larson's tapes with background narration. Waste of 1.5 hour of my time."
2,"joke, weird, obscene, moving - weirdly all three","Initially I thought this was a joke. A Spinal Tap goes to war. Why? Because the hero and his sidekick, ""Wali,"" seem so ridiculously inept. Over the top. The hero seems momentarily spastic and nerdy, and then to have this death wish which then moves him into Rambo territory. Only Rambo as imagined by a Lower East Side hipster. Which makes it obscene. But then somewhere in the movie... for me it was the battle scenes, where I started to get a sense of how violated everyone in the midst of a war zone becomes. Watching these bullets and rockets dancing through the night, vicious and also beautiful, left me feeling empty and sad. That life could be cut short within a second for people in the crossfire. In that respect, the movie is effective. Even if the characters are totally unbelievable."
2,Losing his touch?,"I'm a HUGE fan of this series and I preordered the book prior to publishing because I couldn't wait to see how the next chapter in the saga played out.Unfortunately, I was dissapointed and let down by this latest installment. Although his historical references are still engaging and instructional, he failed to keep my interest in the ongoing characters in Gordianus' family. And where is the promised explanation of how Bethesda was miraculously returned to the family after supposedly drowning in the last book! Was Bethesda even present in this book? Yes, she sat with the family in the grandstands during the triumphs! Is that as extensive as her role is going to be from here on out?The story was loose and not nearly as page turning as the others in the series. I really hope Saylor puts more effort into the next book, if there even is another......."
5,A wonderfully written book,"A great suspense based in ancient Rome. It also gives a unique perspective on Caesar, Cleopatra, and the oft ignored Ptolemy."
4,really cute,"These dolls are very cute and seem durable, and my 2 year old daughter loves them. However, these Plan Toy dollhouse dolls are too big for the Melissa & Doug dollhouse I boughtMelissa & Doug Fold and Go Mini Dollhouse."
5,Very Portable,This is a great laptop for taking on the road. Its very light and has a good battery life. Do not buy this if you want a gaming machine though. The low voltage CPU is slower than what you can get in a more power house laptop designed for games. This one is great of checking email and typing docs. The long battery life is great when traveling. The play DVD movie feature is also handy when on the road. We used ours on a recent trip to store photos with the built in stick reader.
3,NICE SURPRISE OF A READ,"I would have given this book 3 1/2 stars. I bought this book in a thrift store for next to nothing not knowing anything about the author. I am so glad I did.It started off good and kept going all the way to the end. It was a very nice romance story. Rose and Drummond were great characters. I would recommend this book for a nice little fast read of a romance story. It was quite tame compared to the authors I usually read. Bertrice Small, Jennifer Horsman, Lynsay Sands and more."
2,"Steve, please get a better camera if you expect to get $18 for this","I'm an old fan of Steve and have seen him live several times and decided to try the video. The performance is great, sound is OK, but the picture quality is terrible. Grainy as hell, poorly lit. Quality on par with my homemade videos of the kids. I just switch the TV off and listen - it's much more enjoyable that way."
5,Still An Important Political Document,"While ""Quotations From Chairman Mao TseTung"" may not be read very much by most people in China today, it nevertheless provides a concise and accurate look into the time of the ""Great Cultural Revolution.""It certainly brought back memories to my wife who lived in China at the time, and carried and read ""The Little Red Book"" wherever she went."
3,Yes its good but...,"Ive watched Unsolved Mysteries ever since I was little, and I was excited to see sets come out for the series. I got this set for cheap, but just like Ghosts-it lacks some great stories. Ghost might be a better buy, but this is still a good set. Unsolved Mysteries was on for over 10 years I belive, so if the sets were entitled Bizarre Murders Volume 1 or Ghosts Volume 1, id be happy. So many more better and chilling stories are left out, which you can probably find on reruns somewhere. This set is worth the money, but I fondly remember so much better cases then the ones presented. I think Whistle Blown is probably the best story on here."
3,missing dvd,i gave this as a gift was disappointed to find out it was missing disc 4 the whole reason i bought it didnt know if you guys could send another one or not if you could would appreciated everything else in order was fine
1,No Black Dahlia?,"Inquiring rhetorically, how can this otherwise well produced program not include the 1947 unsolved murder of Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia, in Los Angeles? If the physical remains of her body don't constitute a bizarre murder, nothing does."
4,"A Second Generation Reader of ""Nursing Your Baby""","My mother used the first edition of this book to learn how to breastfeed me. When I became pregnant, she found this book for me. It is clear and easy to read. The first half tells all the why's, and clearly supports their arguements. The second half is the how's. With this book I have been able to overcome all the difficulties I encountered while learning how to nurse my son. I have refered to it time and time again to answer all the questions that keep popping up. The only thing I wish it had was photos."
5,My nursing bible,"When I had my daughter in 1971, I think I would have failed at breastfeeding if a friend had not given me this book. I successfully nursed six children with its help. Now that 1971 little girl is expecting her first baby--her mom's sending her a copy of ""my brestfeeding bible""--Ms Pryer's book."
3,very worhwhile,"I was looking for the book I had used when my children were infants, and was delighted to find it on your site. It arrived in good condition."
2,"Long on theory,short on application","This is an overly long book on eastern medical theory. It hooks the reader with a quiz to discover their body type. In the end very little is offered as practical ways to change the balance, except to check into the Chopra Center for Well Being in La Jolla, CA."
2,Very interesting and confusing.,"The first few chapters of this book were extremely interesting to me, but the more I read the more confused I became. Prehaps it was because when I took the body type test I came out 50-50 between two types. Chopra gives an excellent overview to Ayurvedic medicine and does have some help for people who are not clearly one body type or another, but the bulk of the book is spent on helping people who are clearly a Vata, Pitta, or Kapha. In fact some of the information for 50-50 types was contradictory which only heightend my confusion.I recomend to borrow a friend's or library's copy and take the body type test first. If you are clearly one body type over another and interested in Eastern medicine I would highly recomend this book. But it didn't help me personally."
5,Dr. Chopra Has Done It Again,"I specifically purchased this book by Dr. Chopra because I value what he has to say about digestive health, and total health."
5,Total Health The Chopra Way,This is an excellent book that everybody that is concerned with their health should read. It is best to read *before* getting sick but it is also very valuable for those that want to remain healthy or are struggling with their health.
2,Deceptive Title,"This was a good read if you want to learn about the Ayurvedic health principles. If that is what you are looking for, then this is the book for you. My disappointment was in the title. I expected more of Quantum Healing. I still plan on reading more Deepak, but wish I had known that this book was strictly Ayurvedic methodology only."
5,A balanced lifestyle for Western civilisation,"The reader that wrote that the diet listed in this book will cause one to gain 5 to 10 kg obviously missed the part where it says that one should eat about 2 handfuls of food at each meal. As for Dr Chopra being on the heavy side, who said that thin is healthy? In our society we focus too much on how we look, instead of making sure that we are healthy. 'Perfect Health' gives balance, not only through diet, but also massage, meditation and exercise."
3,Mediocre and over priced,"The postive points of this book are that it is upbeat and gives you a few practical steps to do. The bad side is that it gives you *few* practical steps to do. The hard information could have been fit into a pamplet.The rest of the book has testimonials, a slight feel of flim-flam and a subtle advertisement for his line of products.Other books on the subject for the same price easily have 4-5 times practical information."
3,"Deepak, come on now!","Needs to get to the point and be clearer.Good intro to ayurveda, but I have to agree with other reviewers, too much of an advertisement for chopra products and services...which are outrageously priced. In all fairness, if I had tons of money to throw around, I would give some of the programs a try...well, the ones that aren't held in crowded, polluted southern California.Deepak, love ya, but stop advertising."
3,NOW WE FIGHT FUNDAMENTALISM & FANATICISM,"Only 22 years after the ""war to end all wars,"" the world is again aflame and the free world hangs in the balance. Incredible, mostly unseen, film from all sides in all the theaters of combat is central to WORLD WAR II: THE ROAD TO VICTORY. This 440-minute five-disc documentary takes you into the heart of fierce fighting at 20 definitive battles. But you do engage with war at sea, on land and in the air for an in-your-face combat experience of the crucial confrontations of the modern era. Well, up to that point. Now we battle borderless wars of rising fundamentalism and ever fiercer fanaticism."
2,"What the hell, but ok...","Well, I can't say it isn't original, but it really doesn't have that touch you expect in a WWII DVD. The people talking are not articulating enough, and they seem to switch the subject and get you lost. But if you want it for the pictures and videos, it really is great. But I'm not keeping this for too long..."
3,How to Jump & Spin on Inline Skates,"This is a very enjoyable book, and the written descriptions of how to do each jump are very clear. The one thing I really wish it had are clearer illustrations! The stick-figures are confusing, and make it impossible to see which leg or arm is in front or in back. A stop-action progression of photos, or at least a more lifelike, detailed illustration would go a long way towards enhancing the understanding of how these moves are done. Overall, I still recommend the book, and have found the information useful - especially considering there isn't much (if anything) written about this subject."
2,May be useful for beginning inline adults...NOT for ice skaters,"Definitely not for any cross-over (no pun intended) figure skaters.If you are past the USFSA Basic Skills level, the only page in this book that has any potential of being helpful is page 35, ""A note to ice skaters.""I really appreciate the efforts of this book and the niche subject, but it is obviously vanity published, and therefore very, very unprofessional and vexing to read.In perspective, however, I acquired one skating tip from this book for $13 plus shipping, which is considerably cheaper than one tip from a Russian skating coach, plus shipping :)"
1,I don't think so..,DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no picture... no exact illustration... And... the worst thing is we should get the other skate(you may be able to use your inlineskate on some skiils) has 4 wheels and 1 small wheel.
2,Pretty lame.,"Pretty lame, as books go. I read the whole thing and at the end felt like I'd been had. Is airing your every selfish thought now qualified as literature? If you think not, save your money."
2,His self-loathing is justified,"Moderately entertaining to occasionally very funny, this book revealed more about Mr. Jaynes than his fellow passengers and crew members. At its most basic, it is a very sad book. Mr. Jaynes' easy resorts to sarcasm and two-dimensional characterizations of the people he met along his journey left me wanting to know more about these people once the cheap laugh at their expense had faded. Mostly, I noticed his incredible misogyny. From his ambivalence toward his wife and marriage, to his constant references to native women as their body parts to his adoration of his daughter as the incubator of his grandSON, I found his inability to connect with women as human beings very sad. His attitude is usually noticeable in members of the ""older generation"" but he's a Boomer, yet! Where was he when the women's movement happened? Probably in Africa digging up dirt on Dian Fossey. Hope he has a good shrink."
1,Manuscript Should Have Been Swept off the Poopdeck!,"Sullen is not the word I would attach to this diary. Petty or Bitchy would be closer to the point. Mr. Jaynes writes as if he thinks himself witty and clever. Though some may appreciate his brash sense of humor, I did not. He tells of his Camp Granada-like voyage at sea with ten elderly English-speaking passengers, a Russian crew and British officers as if he were the only decent person on board. His superior attitude immediately crushes any observation that might otherwise have been amusing. He calls the ship the ""Anti Betty Ford"" but seems to feel justified in believing himself sober, though time and again he falls off the wagon and engages in disgusting antics while his wife waits for him patiently in New York. Once again I was duped by a book advertising itself as funny, when it is nothing more than the ravings of a smart-ass."
1,Thoughts and feelings better left unpublished,I don't have much to add to the other 1 and 2 star reviews. Really no humor (black or otherwise) in this book. If the author read his memoir before sending it to the publisher he at least has courage to reveal to the world what a sad and lonely life he leads. If you are looking for bile leavened with humanity then read Mencken or P.J. O'Rourke.
1,"Subtitle should read ""A Really Sucky Memoir""","Horrible, boring, and completely uninteresting book about a subject with so much potential: sea travel. Jaynes mostly complains about his fellow passengers amid his vanilla tales about various port stops. Do not waste your money!!!"
2,Why did I read this snob's boring chronicle?,"Who cares? I wish I could talk to one of the shipmates. I bet this guy was a real jerk the whole time out.I could write a better book, but I'm not chummy with the pinhead publishing crowd. Pure bilge."
4,Good but they have a bit of a strong smell,"It took me a while to buy these because I didn't know what the heck a muscat was and in my head I kept seeing a muskrat. I thought 'they look like grapes, but...' The 'but' scared me. After trying 4 other flavors I tried the Muscat. Yum. They're good. They have a good white grapey flavor. I've had 2 bags and the Muscat has a strong smell to me. It's a smell I don't associate with grapes. Again, they are good."
2,Save Yer Dough,"I thought this book was one of the worst I have ever purchased. There are annoying mistakes in the sample queries, e.g., mispelled field names that will just drive you crazy. I can't speak for the WMI section, I bought this book for the SQL Server 2000 with XML info. I learned more at MSDN."
2,Use MSDN Instead,"This book has several frustrating errors in the examples, you have to find the errors to make the example work, e.g., mispelled field name in SQL statement. I was only interested in the XML portion of the book and learned far more by digging in at MSDN's XML site."
5,Welcome and very highly recommended,"Scripting XML And WMI For Microsoft SQL Server 2000 is a quick-start guide to programming with SQL 2000's powerful programming features. Readers will learn how to install the SQL Server and the WMI SQL Server Administration Provider; configure the IIS and SQL Server to work together; stream XML from SQL Server over HTTP; retrieve XML data using the right syntax; crate XML schemas and use them to locate SQL Server data; build and update relational database tables with XML; script WMI using the object-model of WMI scripting API; use the WMI Query Language; Manage SQL Server through WMI, and more. The accompanying CD-ROM contains all the examples and scripts from the book in both VBScript and Perl. Scripting XML And WMI For Microsoft SQL Server 2000 is a welcome and very highly recommended addition to the SQL Server reference shelf."
3,"If its The Popes or The Pogues, both bands need MacGowan!","This is AHELLOFA lot better than any Shaneless Pogues albums. While those two Shaneless Pogue albums are rubbish, this ""Holloway Blvd."" is a decent buy. Paul McGuinness is a great musician, but I just don't like his voice. Anyone would have a hard time standing in MacGowan's shoes at the mike.(Spider,Paul McG.) The Popes sound like a very seasoned bar band to go see live, but the albums vocals just doesn't click w/ me. Great music for damn sure! My suggestion is; if the Popes play without MacGowan, they should go back in time around 1612 a.d. and find a pirate saturated in spiced rum, bring the salty dog back to the 21st century, show him the lyrics, get him drunk, and throw him in front of the mike!, because the music is good enough for someone to invent time travel just for this reason!"
3,"If its The Popes or The Pogues, both bands need MacGowan!","This is a... lot better than any Shaneless Pogues albums. While those two Shaneless Pogue albums are rubbish, this ""Holloway Blvd."" is a good buy.A bit more twang on this album than any Shane albums....But then the last studio album was almost five years ago.(Crock of Gold) So anything from these guys is welcome on my CD player .The Popes sound like a very seasoned bar band to go see live, This is a nice buffer until all those other Popes Albums come out in 2002. (Across the Broad Atlantic, Rare oul songs, 20th century paddy)"
3,Very Promising,"With the possible exception of Flogging Molly there has been nothing to fill the void left by the original Pogues. The Popes even without McGowan may be the answer. The song Holloway Blvd. while taken us to the dregs leaves us with a speckle of hope alluding to Wilde's ""looking at the stars."" Hills of Connemarra if simply brilliant, although unfortunately marred by a bit of gratuitous and blasphemous use of the Lord's name. Vaya con Dios recalls Fiesta but, if you can believe it is better. Of course, Shane gives us his usual fantastic performance in Chino's place. New Rose is the type of piece that start good and gets better with each listening. Hope to hear more."
4,MORE SHANE PLEASE!!,"This is good. Real good. Needs more Shane, though! Reminds me of what the Pogues (with Shane) would have/should have progressed to after ""Hell's Ditch""."
2,Disappointing hotch-potch,"Looking forward to this release, it lacks any of the urgency of Shane's releases, and shows how much the great man is sorely missed by the Popes. ""Mad Dog""'s voice just doesn't cut it, and the material is weak and most of the songs sound the same. Probably the best track is ""Chino's Place"", but overall this album is monotonous, unfortunately."
4,The best songs of the new cd,"Los Temerarios Did it again with they made us feel the love and the pain that we have suffers with ex lovers and guess what they also new rhythem that makes you want to dance la the tittle ""En la Madrugada se fue"" and others songs too. Now dont worry they are still romantic. My personal favorite are ""Te Hice mal"" and ""He Intentado Tanto Tanto"" ""Quise Olvidarme de Ti"" ""Eras Todo para mi"". They are all great. You know what Gustavo Angel the singer give's life to their songs. HE SO HANDSOME TOO."
2,is this a single?,How many versions of Te Hice Mal this cd have???? too many! This is the worst Temerario cd. If you are a new listener of them and want to know them get their album before this( Como te Recuerdo) or the latest one(Una Lagrima No Basta) or better yet: Any of their back catalogue. WHen you have them all THEN get this almost-cd-single.

5,Brings it all together better than any other book so far,"This book basically brings together the major players and their methods, and explores the differences and similarities between them.Every new paradigm needs a clear, concise, yet thorough synthesis of the ideas surrounding it, and the personalities driving it. For the agile paradigm, this is it. This book is highly underrated in my opinion. If you want to understand agile software development, there's only one book you need to read. That is a major accomplishment. Kudos to Jim Highsmith.(originally posted on WikiWiki)"
3,Pretty Good Track but not strong enough for ALI,thsi track isn't that bad as a R.Kelly Song but in the Context with Dealing with Muhammad Ali you gotta pack something a bit stronger for my tastes.R.Kelly did a decent Vocal Performance here but if you are gonna do Ali right you gotta have a Knockout Track&this one doesn't quite bring the Full Punch.
3,This item is NOT very good.,"I wanted a stationary phone because the kids are always wandering off with the cordless handsets. I like the caller ID on this phone, but it has something weird going on with the volume. It may even be defective. The volume abruptly goes in and out while one is talking."
5,Flawless Instruction,"I've really enjoyed using theAshtanga Yoga Primary Series with John Scott DVD.The setup of the DVD is interesting. You can follow the practice from multiple angles, so you get a really good sense of how each movement is performed. Unfortunately, with my new Blu-Ray player, I do not seem to have an ""angle"" button, and cannot take advantage of this feature anymore. It is a real shame, but a problem with my DVD player purchase, and not the DVD itself.I really like the filming. It is simply John on a black mat in a white room. If you turn off the commentary, there is some nice music accompanying the practice. Personally, I prefer to leave the commentary on.You may also want to take a look at David Swenson's DVD (Ashtanga Yoga: The Practice, First Series by David Swenson). Although I own several yoga DVDs, I find that his and Scott's are my favorites, and I keep coming back to them."
5,thanks,sen to a friend in India and he says it is excellent informative history on Guadalupe. and .arrived in good condition
1,Mr. Snow is half right...,"If you're a conservative, as am I, you'll have no problem with Mr. Snow's politics. He raises legitimate concerns about the spread of socialist thinking in America, describing it as a ""mind virus."" Given the pathogenicity of the leftist agenda, the term is apt.However, Mr. Snow falls victim to pop psychology, specifically the heresy that positive thinking alone effects change in our lives, as opposed to reflection, hard work, and persistence. His introductory discussion of the unseen ""vibrations"" all around us is as confusing as it is disturbing. Come to think of it, THAT may be a mind virus.Finally, nearly half the book is devoted to a reprinting of the United Nations Charter and the Humanist Manifestos I and II, which are easily obtained online; no need to pay $16.95 for them. If Mr. Snow stuck to politics and writing original material, his readers would benefit greatly."
2,works for a week - sorta,"The first few days after I plugged this in, you could smell the difference in the air (I smoke and have a dog; it smelled cleaner in a metallic way)After having the air purifier for two weeks or so, the smell was gone, once again replaced by smoke and dog - it's good for a quick fix (in-laws coming over, holiday dinner, etc) but don't expect much for long-term."
2,Not as good as their not-so-great first album,"What can I say? The band went from mediocre to awful. The music screetchs with electronic arrangements and funky beats that don't seem to connect to anything. I liked it even less than I like their first album, which wasn't mucn. I definitely would not recommend it."
4,It grows on you!,"My favorite songs on Obvious - so far- are ""Kick Me"" and ""Let Me Be the One.""I love the energy on this album."
3,Bulletprooff,"Just got this watch used off of ebay for $80 and free shipping. It is a large heavy watch that is no frills but if you are looking for a bulletproof timepiece that you can take everywhere this is for you. I have a citizen (100m) that has fogged twice because the seals failed.My watch is running fast so it will need to go back to Seiko for repair. The Seiko booklets says that +- 15 seconds a MONTH is normal, not +- 30 seconds a day!So KOON NANG is not correct. Automatic Seikos are expected to keep very accurate time."
2,Too fast for me,"I have the same problem as someone who has already written here. The watch runs too fast and makes 1 extra minute a day. Basically, it's impossible to use other than the short dive. The guy who wrote about Rolex and Patec apparently has neither of them. Frankly, neither have I. But I do have Omega and this Seiko could not be even remotely compared to it."
2,Overpriced underachiever!,"When I purchased this watch 8 years ago it looked great & it still does. People would stop to ask me if it was a Rolex & complement it. It broke after 11 months & again after two years. Since Seiko's warranty was 3 years long they repaired the watch twice at no charge. It took a few weeks for the repairs but their customer service was courteous & helpful. The 3rd time it broke, the watch face was turning instead of the hands. I don't recommend it for divers or medium to high impact environments. If your life-style is sedentary this watch is for you. Otherwise, save your money & try something else."
1,Seiko Company Sucks,"This ""was"" a great purchase - I thought. But after less than a year, the watch band broke. This IS covered by the warranty, but the customer service person at Seiko was a nightmare. She said that the watch band was obviously twisted, and basically, called me a liar. Nice Seiko! Good way to treat your customers!!"
1,You'd think for the $ they'd test it,"This watch is very disappointing. It runs about 5 to 6 minutes fast a week. Very annoying. I see from another review mine is not an isolated case. Seiko said I'd have to pay shipping and it would take up to 6 weeks turn around on the repairs. Poor customer service for a brand new watch, what a rip off."
4,"Great watch, but a little slow","I bought this watch a couple months ago and it is superb. It IS a BIG watch but I am a big man and it looks quite hansom on my wrist,but if your not a big guy I woudnt recommend this model. Now onto the timekeeping.When I received the watch it ran a bit fast (30 sec. daily) so instead of waiting the 6 weeks to sent it to Seiko for repair, I took it to the local Seiko dealership/jeweler and had them regulate it for $30, well worth the money and now it runs great. This watch is an absolute tank, I wear it every day, it gets banged around quite a bit, and there has yet to be even the slightest scratch in the hardlex crystal."
3,"Malaysia movement, low quality bracelet","Watch looks very nice, lumibrite charges very quickly and stays bright for a long time. The watch band is is low quality, I'm comparing to the SKA367, this bracelet's flimsy and seems made of inferior materials. I'll look into getting a replacement if possible."
5,Gripping,"Read two thirds of the book in the first sitting. The only reason I put it down was because I had to be up for work in 4 hours. Intriguing characters, facinating plot. Well worth the read. Looking forward to book two."
5,How to Talk to Your Baby,I refer to this book often for ideas when speaking with my little guys. It is an easy read and a great reference tool. I keep it handy!
3,"Simplistic view, Common sense answers","While the information in this book is not flawed or inaccurate, it is very simplistic and common sense would have answered all your questions for you. I read this book, literally, in about 20 minutes. I found that most of the information provided is based on practical solutions that most parents are already doing in any case. I would skip this book if you are looking for a way to improve or increase your child's vocal skills. The only reason you may need this book is if you really simply have no idea how to talk to your child."
2,Short and obvious,"I am surprised how many people rave about this book. Most of what it said seemed, at least to me, extemely obvious. Things like talking to your baby from birth, paying attention to them when they try to speak, encouraging them seemed rather obvious. Others are impressed that you cannot learn to speak from watching TV.Baby Minds was a far more interesting book that gives more incite into communicating with baby and his or her development. Consider reading that instead."
2,Not as good as it used to be,"I love peach tea, and used to buy these tea bags from my local Fresh Mart. When they stopped carrying them, I looked around for almost two years to find them in other stores with no luck. So...I was excited to find them again on Amazon. But, in that time period, something changed with the product, and the design of the box changed also. The ""peach"" flavor is much more artificial now, and is not enjoyable at all. Also, the tea bags themselves seem to be a lot weaker....I am having to use a lot more of them to create a pitcher of tea that tastes like something other than colored water. I am highly disappointed, and I will not be purchasing this product ever again."
2,Does not taste like peach black tea,"I love iced tea - a refreshing, calorie-free, healthy drink. I have tried other flavors in this line, including tropical (herbal) and lemon black tea (looks like they eliminated this flavor from the product line) and was satisfied enough to try the peach black tea flavor - yuck.While not totally undrinkable, it does not taste like black iced tea with peach, more like a bouquet of artificial flavors with fake cinnamon flavoring, like the one you taste in ""hot"" cinnamon candies. Find a good hot tea and go through the trouble of chilling it with ice because this is simply disappointing."
5,Easy for on the go,"How easy can it be? You just add a tea bag to cold water and wait for 5-10 minutes and have very tasty tea. I carry around a bottle of water, drop in a bag and presto! flavored water."
3,"5-star convenience, 3-star flavor","I bought this for the convenience of not having to boil water and heat up our camper in the summer. I love the ease and convenience of this tea, but wish the flavor were better. Not only is the tea very weak (I need to use three bags to obtain the flavor of one traditional tea bag), it has a slightly ""off"" taste as well.It is also a good product in that you can toss a bag into your water bottle before you leave home and have tea for the road with no fuss.It isn't undrinkable, and we're finishing off our boxes slowly but surely; but my entire family would much rather drink traditionally brewed Stash Peach tea."
3,needs some tartness to taste good,"Tastes good if I mix it with some lemonade to get some tartness, otherwise tastes like an herbal scent bag."
3,Cool brew = requires lots of tea bags.,"I liked the ""idea"" of a cool brew, but if you actually drink a lot of tea it's just not that practical. It takes 16 bags to brew a gallon, and since I typically brew 2 gallons at a time that's basically one box per one batch of tea. Directions say steep for 5-10 minutes but I find that produces a pretty weak tea if you're actually using cold water. I've found hot water from the tap produces the best flavor for that 5-10 steeping time, but then you do have to cool the tea to drink it, so kind of beside the point. It does have a really good flavor, but don't think I will repurchase."
1,celestial tea (peach) cold brew,"No real flavor,used up two 4 bags and still no real taste. If you want my future business remove this product from my list. I like the cold brew Lipton tea and will continue to buy it. Glass size only."
3,Lite Peach Flavor,"This tea certainly has a plesant flavor and the cold brew system works well. However, its not the strongest peach tea I've had. Taste more like a mild plum kind of flavor. Also, if you leave the bags in too long the taste becomes somewhat curt and overly tangy."
4,COOL BOOK!,"I like this book because there are a lot of gross things in it and pictures showing the gross things. It is very interesting. It is one of my favorites in the series. (written by mom, but info provided by 9 yr old boy)"
2,I Must Be Missing Something,"This has to be one of the strangest concepts and executions I have ever born witness to. Actor Crispin Glover, best known as George McFly from Back To the Future, takes a book written in the late 1800's about catching vermin and randomly inserts several sketches and ink blots, as well as changing the text when he doesn't like the way things are going, before releasing this thin ""book"" under his own name. Long known as an eccentric(check out some of his recordings,)this certainly comes close to broaching the line of full blown insanity. Interesting only as a curious example of ""outsider art,"" Rat Catching is best approached cautiously, and preferably while intoxicated."
5,Old Happy,"This is one of Happy Traums older videos but I like Homespun tapes and already had the newer version so I fiqured what the heck. Great video not as informant as the newer ones but works great once you master them. If you like old blues, the true blues this is a great video to have. Blues players no that the older you get the less fancy you play, no more lightin riff just deep hearted pickin and this video has it. If you like the true blues then do yourself a favor and pick this up. You can always resell it if you don't like it but I don't think that will be the case"
2,Major Disappointment,"I recently purchased this Panasonic SuperFlat to replace anolder - but superb - 27"" Sony Trinitron with a largerscreen. After setup and several days of attempting to adjust and balance the color, I found the Panasonic color system to be significantly inferior to the Sony Trinitron color system. The Panasonic colors are supersaturated. The reds are unusually muddy, the blues and greens very noisy, and the flesh tones annoyingly artificial. I also found the resolution (sharpness) to be poor compared to Sony. I would highly recommend seeing a demonstration of this set in action before purchasing. On the positive side, Amazon.com was amazingly cooperative and helpful in allowing me to return this set and exhange it for a 32"" Sony Wega, which I learned the hard way is more than worth the substantially higher cost. Thank you Amazon for such great assistance, understanding, and service."
3,Nice set for the foot=print,"I purchased one I purchased this set because it had the smallest dimensions I could find for a 32"" TV. If Panasonic would move the speakers to the bottom of the set, they could have made this TV a 35"" without making the set any larger."
5,excellent in combination,I plan to use this book in combination with a traditional MIS textbook in an undergraduate course in a political science/public administration setting. It is clearly written and addresses not only information but also complexity in the design of government systems. I think this book is a rare and valuable resource that will spark a lot of discovery and discussion in class among my students.
4,"a unique resource, nothing else like it","Not for novice climbers who need more detailed descriptions or are looking only for the same crowded peaks covered in the other Colorado guidebooks. But a unique resource for more experienced climbers/hikers/backpackers with hundreds (thousands?)of peaks and other destinations to explore. No other book I've found covers ALL of Colorado's mountains - with enough info to get you going on the right ridge or around the odd obstacle. I've climbed nearly 1000 peaks in Colorado and never needed another guide, although others may find the descriptions too short."
5,"Good for ideas, but not necessarily routes.","Randy Ormes' ""Guide to the Colorado Mountains"" is an excellent primer for hiking: it has every imaginable peak and point. Planning on go hiking, but are unsure of where to go? If so, pull out Ormes' guide for ideas and a sense of where to go. This book is far from short on ideas.The strengths of Ormes' guide are also its weaknesses. The diversity of routes is a plus; however, documenting so many peaks also means brevity: i.e each route has to be distilled down a paragraph or so. A paragraph is seldom sufficient to supply the necessary information."
5,A real sword,"when you see it, just buy it. This is the best sword I have. If you are looking for some decoration to hang on the wall, it might not be the best choice. But once you held it in your hand, you would know that it's a real sword."
4,"Thanks, Kathryn","I have started to read a lot of biographies, and somehow most of the authors manage to extinguish my passionate interest in the lives of the greats by a tedious writing style. Kathryn Hughes' book George Eliot: The Last Victorian is innocent of such charges. In fact, the book is both eruditely scholarly and reads like an exciting novel. I hope Kathryn Hughes writes more biographies."
3,"Interesting, flawed","Kathryn Hughes' biography of George Eliot is informative and interesting, written in a manner that is always lively if sometimes a touch vulgar. It helped me to get a sense of how the supreme inwardness of GE's mature work came through her life-long and never fully successful struggle towards freedom and maturity for herself. What KH has to say about GE's novels, though nowhere deep or original, is mainly adequate for her purpose, which makes it surprising that the only things she says about Dickens's work are childish. Her insulting treatment of F. R. Leavis's great contributions to our understanding of GE is less surprising if no less deplorable. It is also a shame that the cover on the paperback is from the most untruthful of all the portraits of GE - the one that goes furthest in rendering as insipidly pretty a face which was, as Henry James said, ""magnificently ugly""."
4,Eliot: All Too Human,"I never thought a biography could be such a page-turner. Credos to Hughes for succeeding deliciously in bringing Eliot to life with all her faults and insecurity, in the fullest context of Victorian Britain! The fact that towards the end of the book, the reader starts to tire a bit of the description of repeated character flaws in the person of George Eliot only attests to the realness of the biography, bringing all of the multifacted personality behind the writing to light. Her deep-seated insecurity and her desperate struggle to cope with it should be comforting to know for all who suffer qualms about themselves from time to time. And plus, the touch of humor in Hughes's writing every once in a while was a joy. I never went near Eliot's books since childhood, I did not know much about either her or her works, and it was sheer fluke that I came across this book, but now I am glad I did."
2,Not very soulful,"I've been listening to Hammond B3 players for a long, long time ever since the age of 15, my theory is ""if you're gonna play the B3, then tame the beast"", the B3 is nothing to mess around with. Linda Dachtyl ""Blue Bop"" is sorely missing the point, it want to hit the soul blues feel but backs off and eventually just falls off the blues cliff, under the direction of the monsterous Tony Monico I'd expected a lot better. My suggestion to future buyers, if you enjoy the topical feel in the style Linda plays the B3, then this disc is for you, BUT, if you love the soul jazz blues that is drenched inj the warm soulful and the not afraid to go there blues licks that make you say 'YEAH', then stay away from this production, cause you""re not gonna get it!"
5,Music Magic,"I bought this Yamaha as a gift for our daughter-in-law's birthday. Had to try it out before I took it to her and it sounds as good as my big Yamaha Clavinova. (By the way, I bought the Clavinova in 87 and it's been faultless.) Our duaghter-in-law had been using a small keyboard, was speechless when she saw what we'd brought her! Another thing that amazed me was how quickly it arrived. Thanks for making the givers and the birthday both very happy."
1,"no good, a ...",okay this keyboard does not give you the name of the songs your are playing and the eduation suite is [bad] b/c it doesn't teach you how to play your own songs. in fact you can't even learnto play the songs programed ithe computer b/c the keys go so incredibly fast.
2,Many innacurate captions,Recently borrowed this book from local library. I live in Cheshire so know many of the locations featured. I found many of the captions innacurate or misleading eg A picture of Stafford station after rebuilding in the 1960s referred to as Macclesfield and Cheadle Cheshire on the old CLC line from Stockport to Liverpool referred to as Cheadle Staffs. So wouldn't add to my library.
5,Far East Man,"If i'm like anyone else, I bought this for the song ""Far East Man."" I had never heard or seen Ron Wood live so i bucked up. I loved the album ""Ive got my own album to do"" and there's a couple songs from that on here. The video is pretty cool apart from Ron Woods vocals. the guy sounds terrible. The back up vocals help out but you can tell he's had a few too many prior to going on stage. The highlight for me was the Slash stuff. They have a cool dressing room shot where they actually start warming up with Far East Man. It's really cool because i finally figured out how to play the damn song. there are some good gems on here ...if you are a big fan you will enjoy it."
2,very disappointing,"I've been a fan of Ron Wood from his days with Jeff Beck, to Rod Steward's solo recordings, to The Faces, to Woody's solo records, and to the Stones, but this is a disappointing DVD to me. Ron shouldn't be singing at all, as his voice is gone. Nor should he be playing harmonica. The band doesn't have any passion and fire. And Slash's appearance was puzzling to me. He didn't add anything worthwhile at all to the concert.I give it 2 stars because I like most of the songs. If you want to see Woody in his prime, hunt down the Faces ""Bad-n-Ruin"" DVD bootleg."
3,average cap,"Basic, small mouthpiece cap that fits over a mouthpiece and thin ligature. Will not fit over Rovner Eddie Daniels model, or a thick leather ligature."
3,set biblical,"I'm perfectly good, although I did expectations, I thought it was longer and it was so close to my neck, I thought it was brown and gave me the black, but is a good product and fits perfectly in my head."
2,Okay but could have been much better.,"Considering that I'm 12 years old this may sound funny but this book came across a little immature. I mean the main character Elspeth was so emotionally immature that it made me feel old. Also the story just dragged on and on going no where. The writing style itself is not bad at all, it is the plot and story lines that really lack depth and the moral angles are so cliched and politically correct...it's all too much. I enjoy some of the themes like the psychic stuff but these skills seem to be only glanced over really and they the characters are just so weak when using them. What's the point?"
5,it's great!!!,"This is the first book I read in the Obertenwyn series, on a dare, as the book resembles a house brick, and 'you couldn't possibly read that!' so, i read it to prove i could read long books in a short amount of time...i didn't know i'd be hooked on Carmody's writing afterwards! This would have to be my personal favourite book in this series, I've got some of my other friends (...)to read them also and they too think they're great. This proves that Carmody's writing appeals to a large range of readers, as all of my friends have different tastes in books. The characters are really good in this book, and the Keeping place, the 4th book, is also really really good. only one more to come after the Keeping Place...;( i hope she continues anyway! Good reading!"
5,Gatsby Forever,I love these Fiddler & Fiora books! Love the relationship between the main characters and Fiddler is a man to be reckoned with. Loved this book! I have no more words about it. Fiddler and Fiora novels bring back a sort of nostalgia that IS like the Gatsby era!
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,I thought it would be a fairly good item to give to my husband. But the leather cover came off quickly after a few use. Filling up the bottle is a bit messy as well.
4,Good for the price,I think it is funny how many people slam this item because the faux leather is peeling off! Take away a star but it's hardly useless because of it. It is 100% correct though. Was peeling when I opened it up the first time. Just put a little glue on it and it's fixed. Looks nice and should do the job for an upcoming vacation!
1,Flask,"Cheaply made! Product looks great out of the box but the imitation leather is pealing off and all it's done is sit on the shelf of my bar. It has never been used, washed or anything. I guess I will have to get some industrial strength clue and so it myself."
1,Looks great BUT...,"Have used this flask minimally and it is coming UNGLUED. Not even a year old and the ""leather"" wrap is peeling off. In 2 words...CHEAP JUNK."
2,bad quality,"I got this flask because it looked semi-classy. The fake leather looks real, but out of the box it was already peeling off. They either didn't use enough glue or the wrong kind for these kind of materials. It only got a 2* from me because it's been full and hasn't leaked despite being in a bag and toppled in all directions.I would avoid this as others have had the same problem. Either go a different brand or spend a little extra for a higher quality product."
1,the faux leather is coming off,"Right out of the box, the cheap adhesive used to stick the faux leather to the flask is coming off. Disappointed."
4,Good Value,"It seems sold out for the time being, but this is a good value product. The container itself is well made and sold and I'm sure it won't ever have any leaks.The one problem would be with the leather cover. It could have been applied better, but as long as it keeps holding up I'll be happy (although it seems like it could fall off eventually). If it does fall off... well I can just glue it back on.Most importantly it does what it's supposed to do and fits nicely in pockets."
2,Adhesive problem; poor craftsmanship,"The faux leather started coming of pretty soon. The cap leaks. And recently, after nearly 3 years of light use, the top part of the flask (not the cap) separated from the body causing massive leaking. I would not buy again."
2,Cheaply Made,"I bought this for my husband (for Christmas) to use for his bourbon when he goes out for poker night. Even though I read the reviews, I figured that the flask that I ordered wouldnt have the cover peeling off. Well, I was wrong. It was peeling right out of the box. Tried using super glue, but even that isnt holding.I'll probably end up taking the cover off and having it bound in real leather."
1,DONT BUY!!!,"It came with the fake ""leather"" peeling off. I was foolish to think it wouldn't be like that on mine after reading all the reviews. I cant believe amazon still allows this seller to sell products on its website. I should have listened to the reviews and the pictures demonstrating the products flaws. I only gave it 1 star because it is the required minimum to post a review."
2,"I hate to say it, but he really should stick to Fantasy","I really tried to like the Fallon series, but just couldn't. The Fallon Blood wasn't bad, but The Fallon Pride was a waste of my time. Maybe it's because I had just read David Nevin's far superior book on the same subject: ""1812"". The Fallons seem to bounce around like Forrest Gump, finding themselves in the middle of an absurd number of historical events. None of Mr. Jordan's strong characterization from the Wheel of Time series is in evidence. He should probably stick to Fantasy, but maybe it's just that he has problems writing books less than 1,000 pages or so."
1,This book was not well=planned,"The only reason this book is not a one is that the book's predecessor, Fallon Blood was so good. There were too many intertwined characters and too many loose ends. No wonder the third book never came to fruition. The book played out like a soap opera with its horrible incest story line. It ruined what started out as a promising series."
5,Excellent!!!,"I found this an excellent follow-up to ""The Fallon Blood"". I enjoyed the way the historical characters were portrayed as human rather than as the semi-mythical beings they come across as in so much literature ( i.e. Jefferson in his comfy old slippers). The incest subplot was a nasty twist. I can hardly wait to read the third book in the series. Oh yeah, I was glad when the ladies killed Justin."
2,Educate yourself about polycarbonate,"It's ironic this ""hydration bottle"" is marketed with a ""Breast Cancer Awareness"" angle, because polycarbonate is known to leach Bisphenol A under certain common conditions. A wikipedia search for ""bispenol"" yields this bit of information:""...Recent studies have confirmed that bisphenol A exposure during development has carcinogenic effects and produce precursors of breast cancer.... ""If this information helps even one person avoid this awful disease, it was certainly worth writing about."
2,This water bottle LEAKS!!,"I have huge water stains on my car seat where this water bottle has toppled over while driving with the water seeping/leaking out. In addition, the top can be somewhat difficult to twist open, it does not keep liquid cold for very long and there is has been no elimination of condensation. I would not recommend this item except for the fact that some of the proceeds go to cancer research."
5,Best water bottle ever!,"I've purchased this bottle in the past so I jumped at the chance to buy it in pink to support breast cancer research!The bottle is even better than pictured because it's all pink even the top!I like this water bottle because it is doubled walled so it doesn't ""sweat""; it has grips on the sides for easy handling; it has a loop on the top so I find it easy to carry it with my hands full of other items; it has a twist and shut top (I don't use this feature but it might be good for someone else); and BEST OF ALL, the bottle is nearly unspillable!!! This is very important for me because I am klutz and knock things over frequently plus I have three large dogs with powerful tails. They knock my bottles over all the time.I recommend this bottle to my friends."
2,What about BPA,"It is a bit annoying that it doesn't fit in the cup holders at the gym, but I love the fact that this bottle keeps drinks cold--as long as you add ice. However, it is tricky to drink out of it without whistling, and if it tips over it does leak a bit. I can't shake it up to mix flavors into my water--again the leak issue. All pink or black and pink doesn't seem like a big deal. Although seeling the pictured product seems like a good idea. I am concerned about BPA and a bottle that you shouldn't wash in the dishwasher seems a little silly. I wish I could find a BPA free,truely leak proof, insulated bottle like this."
2,Not the same color as the picture,I ordered this product for someone and recieved an all pink bottle which i have to say looks pretty ugly. I had ordered the one with the black sides and lid and everthing else pink but i didnt get that.
5,a terrific waterbottle,I am completely satisfied with this water bottle. I fill it up with ice and water and take it to a class with me. The double sided walls prevent the usual pool of water on the table that used to bother me. The water stays cool the whole time I'm at the class--and that can be from 8:30am to 3pm. Lots of friends want them now but didn't want to get the pink. It would be great if Amazon carried them in blue as well.
1,"Lid does NOT seal, therefore spills when used.","Have now purchased two of these cups because the base fit in our vehiclescup holders and we liked the grip design. However, we don't use them at all, the lids do not seal (apparently) because they leak each & every time they have been used. Feel like i just burned $$ in the yard."
3,Great Product - sort of,I love this water bottle! It's really convenient to bring to the gym or to have in class when I'm teaching. My only complaint is that it's not destructable like it claims to be. I had my water bottle for 2 days when my dog knocked it off the coffee table (it fell less than 2 feet onto a carpet)and it cracked.
2,Meet Dr. Christian Synergy seller version,"I will only point out that in the version of the dvd I bought from Synergy, part way though the film there is a jump cut to a later scene in the film (I didn't understand what had happened until I had viewed the entire film and then realized that this jump cut belonged much later). I may break down and buy the film from another company to see if there is only one apparent source print or if it is Synergy's version that is faulty."
4,too wonderfull not to pay attention to.,"I have had the disks for 5 month. I still find the music truly enchanting. This has been a problem in itself. The music is too nice not to pay active attention to, which detracts one from falling sleep. I wish there were more low frequency harmonics repeating itself, so one forgets actively listening to and let the low frequency do its job for deep phase sleep."
1,Bait and switch,"Don't be fooled by the recent picture of Pat on the cover. This is nothing more than a rearranged version of the King Biscuit release Greatest Hits Live. The King Biscuit release is 76 seconds longer. I'm not sure where those seconds went. But to be safe, stick with the King Biscuit release."
3,Beautiful but gratingly ethnocentric.,"It's a premise with enormous potential. This expedition goes down the Omo river to places very few cameras have ever been. The raw footage of the people living along the banks is wonderful. But I found myself getting progressively angrier at the narration as the film went on. I wish someone with any kind of Anthropological training had been included to give context to the footage.I particularly found the constant ""noble savage"" theme to be insulting. I understood that she was trying to say they hadn't been exposed to Western Influences, but constantly admiring how 'primeval' and 'primitive' and 'close to nature' they are is just condescending. She slipped and referred to them as barbaric a couple of times, and I got the feeling that this is what she was really thinking the whole time.There were so many places this documentary could have gone, if only it had been done or reviewed by someone with the training to understand the cultures they encounter."
2,Disappointingly condescending,"The previous two reviews really captured it. I was intrigued by the premise, but really disappointed by the execution. The narrator was an American, although the perspective she was narrating was that of a Frenchwoman. The narration was flat, condescending, and irritating. This is a movie about a group of fool-hearty European adventurers with seriously biased and condescending attitudes. So much potential and yet so disappointing compared to a subsequent work by Pavol Barabas--'Pururambo'--a wild journey through the jungles of Papua New Guinea, which is quite good."
1,My eyes!,"Ack, how did this steaming pile of cinema ever get made?Matt Leblanc proved his acting talents peaked with ""Friends"", but then again with such a lousy script, I'm not even sure Harrison Ford could have attempted such lines and come out with his career unscathed.William Hurt is miscast here. He just doesn't strike me as the idealistic scientist type with his low key mumbling. The space uniforms were very wierd....watching Lacey Chabert (presumably 14 years old at the time) wearing a skintight outfit ... makes ya feel wierd, though I didn't mind it much on the older chicks.Gary Oldman plays his tired evil-guy sniveling role yet again, and while its nice to have cute kids and robots in movies, this is definitely not a kiddie film with all the violence and stuff blowing up."
1,Turkeys in Space,"This thing is a truck load of turkeys. Buy this movie, and you'll get deep fried turkeys, frozen turkeys, microwaved turkeys, ice cream turkeys, charcoal roasted turkeys, yougart-flavored turkeys, marinated turkeys, undercooked turkeys, rotten turkeys, diet turkeys, ultrasonic turkeys, infected turkeys, dead turkeys, unintelligent turkeys, English-speaking turkeys, over-sized turkeys, turkey-like turkeys, ... It's the reunion of Turkeys' Class of '65. You must see it!"
2,"good start, confusing finish","Starts of promising, but I found the end to be a confusing mess. Danger Will Robinson, spend your money somewhere else..."
4,"Great special effects, fast-moving, well cast.","The special effects and fast-paced action keep the movie flowing and the film was cast quite well. With the possible exception of Matt LeBlanc, the acting was decent to good and Gary Oldman plays a perfectly diabolical Dr. Smith (though certainly more evil than his 60s TV counterpart)."
4,Excellent theatrical experience,Good quality picture & sound make this entertaining movie enjoyable in a home theater. Lots of extras make for an interesting look behind the scenes. Love the interface!
2,"Good Movie, but sound is definately not there","When I first watched this movie I thought my receiver or speakers were acting strange because the lips of the actors didn't quite line up with the actual sound. After putting in several other DVD's to confirm this phenomenon I am convinced that the sound/video synch on this DVD is flawed.Putting the sound through a regluar TV set seemed to minimize the problem, although it was still apparent. If you have a good quality sound system you'll find this effect almost unbearable.Aside from the sound, the video is clean with a tremendous amount of special effects. The images seem to suffer the same problem as does the Star Trek - First Contact DVD, inasmuch as the video is SO detailed that it starts to look TOO artifical. The Laserdisc and VHS (obviously) produced a more relaxed slightly fuzzier picture that looked more realistic with the special effects."
4,Lost in Space,"Although I didn't think this movie was going to be any good..I was surprised to find it visually appealing w/ AWESOME sound (5.1) With the addition of all those 'extras', I believe this is a 'must-have' in a beginners DVD collection."
3,Great Special Effects!,"The special effects for this movie are great. The movie would have been awesome if the story was better. This is an example of the directors trying to make up for story through the use of special effects. Sadly it doesn't happen, and some of the dialogue uttered through the movie had me laughing at times. I gave it three stars because it's a movie good for the whole family to view, but that's it."
3,I've read a lot of the reviews here and...,"I have one thing to say, listen up: I totaly and utterly agree with everyone that said just sit back and have fun. Why you ask? Here's the reason: Do you honestly go to a movie like Lost in Space or Star Wars expecting a wonderful story? I think not, or I hope not. How can you even think to do that when the trailer has cheap techno music in the backround, no. You go to a movie like this to have fun. The special effects are top-notch and some of the acting is good (Gary Oldman leading the bunch. Mimi Rogers in Close second. Willim Hurt and Mat LeBlanc in third). But of course the story is a little iffy and at one point a little confusing. And the screenplay is bla. But really, just see this to have a good time. I don't recommend to buy it, but do see.What do you have to lose? Go see American Beauty if you want to think."
1,Horrible. Boring. Hokey.,And way too loud. You know you're in trouble when the best thing about a film is the closing credits. Don't bother.
1,Lost in Space,"Utterly tragic. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.The plot is ridiculous, the characters are weak. Underneath all the eye candy is a rotton apple."
1,Get lost...in space...for good,This movie stinks like a 400 year old hot dog in a dump. The story is just as dumb as the WCW Bash At The Beach 2000 PPV. The writing is just as bad as the writing from TNA Impact. The Acting is just as bad as the acting from Ready to Rumble. The effects are ok. The movie is also even boring like William Hurt's acting. It's not very imaginative at all. One of the worst films of the 1990's I give this film a 1 out of 10.
3,Amazing special effects althought the story is lacking,"If you are a fan of sci-fi, then you will enjoy LiS. The special effects are amazing and the story is relatively good until they meet up with the other Jupiter space craft. The acting isn't great but tolerable. I recommend it for rental but not for purchase.Darin"
2,"IT Was a good try, but failed...","This was a good try to remake the television series, with great budget, but it sounds a little bit ""heartless"". Hurt is totally without charisma (contrary to Guy Williamson in the series. THe movie never takes off, but there are certain good and funny moments. It used the old plot of ""time-travel"" to make the history."
2,The DVD features are better than the film,"Got this free with a DVD player promotion. Good thing, because I wouldn't want to pay for it. Excellent special effects, a potentially viable premise, but it falls flat on its face. Poor ending as well.The various DVD features are the only saving grace of this film. Spent more time with those than I did watching the film."
2,"No heart, no soul","The thing that made the television series so interesting was the strange (and campy) alien intelligences that the Robinson family seemed to encounter each week. This crucial element from the television series is entirely missing from this film. Unfortunately, no amount of special effects or high-tech wizardry, which this movie has plenty of, is enough to save it. Instead of interesting aliens, the movie bombards us with a horde of spiders that become tedious after two minutes. Its truly incredible that with all the millions of dollars spent on this movie, no one was able to figure this out!"
1,Boring!,"Nothing but explosions, boring diagolue, Dr. smith is not endearing like the old episodes. Very disappointing! Spend your money on the old lost in space."
3,Can't you just have FUN at a movie?,"I know I'm in the minority, but I thought LIS was a lot of fun. Yeah, the plot was full of cliches, but the cast did a good job and of course the fx (except for the unforgiveable monkey thing) were top-notch. I think it would have done better if it were released as a summer movie (the film came out in April of 1998). Why? Because, in general, audiences are less demanding of summer movies. At the very least, Lost in Space is a good family film. And Matt LeBlanc was so great, I hope he'll get another chance to show a more serious side in another movie.Lost In Space was hardly perfect, but it's also not nearly as bad as many people would have you believe."
1,Give me a break!,"VEry poorly written, could have been better! Special effects were okay but needs to be more realistic. Don't waste your money on this one folks!"
3,Edited from the theatrical release,"This version of the film was edited from the theatrical release. Any suggestive language was removed, especially from young Penny and Judy Robinson. The product review does not mention that this version is tamed down from the theatrical release and you should know that before buying."
1,Gave It One Star 'Cuz There wasn't any Zero!,"""Lost in Space"" is one of those ho-hum (boring) moviez. Why did they even bother making this horrible movie? I don't know--do you? Anyhow I thought this horrible film was boring THE WHOLE WAY THRU! Don't get it. Please!"
5,Now listen to the music!,"The film may have been a bit iffy, it was just a glorified television episode, but I loved it for that. Brilliant, but The Music!!!!! What a score! What a selection of tracks! What genius chose the music.Thankyou sir, whoever you are."
1,Wide Screen Only format - kills it's home presentation.,"In a 2.35 : 1 only wide screen format, it won't fit most home-entertainment-centers for 10 or more years. On the computer, its great! But again even on a 21"" monitor you are looking at a 16"" wide by 6.5"" high presentation again - invite guests over if you provide the magnifying glasses or you can all get so close that you don't mind their breath (and they don't mind yours)."
3,"Except for some language, It's okay.","Be sure and rent it before you buy it. Unless, you've seen it and liked it then you'll end up getting it."
3,Descent but not best blu-ray quility,"I loved this movie on DVD. It was always refrence material for me, but the blu-ray although good and definatly HD did not match up to other blu-rays I have watched."
3,Lost in Space gets kinda lost...,"This movie could have been so much better. The first half of the film was good, but after they escape those spider things (which weren't really that menacing) the movie goes kinda downhill from there. It's like the guy who was writting the script had a massive heart attack, died, and the guy they repalced him with had no idea what he was doing. The acting was alright, but the movie relied too much on special effects that would become dated."
3,"Not a great movie, but the damm thing is great fun!","Lost in Space fans who loved the original show may not have been quite happy with this movie, (and some hated it) but this is a FUN movie with eye poping effects and a nice sense of humanity. That said, I wish the script went through one or two more re-writes, to develop more 3 dimensonal personality for the actors, and to clear up the story. However, I found myself enjoying this movie alot. Visually stunning and with a superb surround sound mix. This is a MUST for anyone showing off a home theater system. The actors all do a fine job, with kudos to mimi rogers and Gary Oldman. The fans of the original show (I am one) should enjoy this movie. Doing a film in the same tone as the campy TV series would have been a TRUE disaster. This film, While by no means great, is great fun, and after all...thats a fine accomplishment in itself."
2,Smith: Death by blowtorch!,"Danger Will Robinson; this film is so icky sweet at times your in danger of getting diabeties just by watching it. Fun for a walk down memory lane for fans like me who were young during the shows first run, it now is just less than mediocre scifi flick. Nostalgia and popcorn if nothing else is on and you got a cold sixpack in the fridge, nothing more."
2,Not like the classics!,"One would think that this ""Lost In Space"" would have kept closer to the storyline. However, the storyline was poor and the actors were nothing to brag about. I found myself turning away when certain characters came on because they were so annoying.This film is worth buying to entertain your kids in desparation. That's really it!"
5,Lost in Space,"I had this movie on VHS and it is my all time favorite movie and when I tried to find it on dvd to purchase, I could not find it. My daughter suggested I try Amazon.com. Found it quickly and received it about three days from the time I bought it."
3,"OK, but with a serious omission","Virtually unrelated to the TV show (so not much of a nostalgia trip), but a decent SF movie on its own. By definition, any movie containing Gary Oldman (the most versatile actor in history) has a lot going for it, but if you have the grown-up-Will-Robinson thing going, why not use Billy Mumy??? He obviously is a talented actor (cf. Babylon 5). Worth watching, and the disc (at a discount) has a fair number of extras."
4,Fun,"Why does this movie get panned by 'critics' so much?Why would anyone have wanted an effort which merely copied what went before? Folks should just relax! I too enjoyed theoriginal series while growing up, but I found thisupdated take to be refreshing and what it was supposedto be: Fun. The acting is good, the plot revolvingaround the father and son relationship actually had a bitof depth, and the romance factor was kept at a minimum, as it should be in sci-fi. I was also set to be critical if need be, but once over I thought it was a solid if not spectacular effort."
3,BORING.,This movie was so boring.Doctor Smith wasevil in the show he wasn't evil.They shouldhave made it more about of what happendin the show But it was some what entertaning.
1,Ugggghhhhhhh...,"This is one of the most unsatisfying movies I have ever watched. Man, I haven't seen it in a while (thankfully), so I can't really go into great detail, but the thing that stands out most in my mind about watching it was how much I wanted it to be over. It was just really uninteresting. Rehashed plot, dull, cliched characters, and it relied more on special effects, which have all but ceased to impress me. Not recommended at all."
4,Problems running other parts of DVD,The movie rocks! But my Laptop (Gateway 9100XL) could not view any part of the DVD other that the movie. Everything else was choppy. Please let me know if you had the same problem.
1,Fake special effects + no plot = Painful to watch,"Hollywood takes a great old TV show and does a VERY poor job of bringing it up to date. George Lucas, if he watched more than 2 minutes of this total piece of trash, had to be embarassed for the genre."
2,Lost in Space (DVD),"Arrived in good condition, in a timely manner. Was kind of dorky, very little in common with original TV show."
5,Loved IT!,"I had already saw this movie on DVD of course, but I just had to get it in Blu-Ray for my own enjoyment of watching it in a clear HD environment & it did not let me down. I have heard & saw reviews from Other people saying the movie was not a great movie. Well I grew up watching Lost In Space the TV show & I absolutely loved it & I watch it over & over again. This is a great movie especially if you have a family to watch it with like kid's because it is totally kid friendly. I like the futuristic stuff in the movie & I would love to have the video diary watch even as an adult it would still be cool to have one. Anyway if you have an open mind check it out. Do not listen to others because apparently they have no taste what so ever because this movie rocks & I can't wait until my little niece get's a little older so she can watch it also. I am very glad that I bought this movie in Blu-Ray Form because it looks so good on my biggie screen(Smile). As always Amazon you Rock!"
2,LOST IN SPACE...LOST ME EARLY ON,"Muddy, perplexing, unsavory, dis-loyal...and the retardedlooking cartoon pet monkey is unwatchable. And what in the hell wasthe point in even showing the stupid monkey anyway? Thats when I got up and left. A truly blasephemous reprisal of a minor Sci-fi TV classic. Given two stars only because of the promise and tease here and there. Ed Wood could've done better! HEY! PLAN 9 FROM LOST-IN-SPACE!"
2,"Next time, the spaceship gets blown up by an asteroid.","I saw this movie at the late show in Florida at 11:00 PM with about 7 other people in a movie theater. Obviously, the director cared more about the special effects than on the acting provided by the characters. I think a much better ending to the movie (than the one provided) is have the spaceship actually get blown up (for good) by the exploding planet. This would have prevented any possible sequel to this movie."
4,Seat back and enjoy!!,"When it comes to sci-fi movies i like the ones that take you on an adventure, and Lost in space did it for me. Like everyone else I liked the special effects, didn't care much for the acting and the sound track was just as good as the movie it self, it left me wanting more ( a sequal perhaps?)."
1,One of the most stupid movies ever,"There are some very good guys and there are some very bad guys. Great, original idea, right? :) Add a lot of special effects to balance poor content and you get another blockbuster. The worst part is that the end of the movie suggests a sequel!"
1,Another Remake Misses the Mark,"Concentrated too much on special effects, and substituted a cliché ""Time Loop"" plot for a interesting story. Gone is all the campy goodness and adventure of the original series. Don't waste money seeing it."
5,Gary Oldman had a good part as Doctor Smith.,"In the year 2058, The Earth is dying, no longer supporting life, and the only planet that can save the human race is Alpha Prime, and the only way to get there, is through a hypergate. Proffesor John Robinson, has constructed a spaceship called Jupiter 2, so he and his family can be the first ones to colonize Alpha Prime, He takes Wife Maureen, Daughters Judy and Penny and Son Will along the ride. The ship is piloted by War hero Major Don West. But on ther way, Doctor Smith sends the ship dangerouslly off course, getting the Robinsons lost in a dangerous part of part of the galaxy. Can The Robinsons find their way back to Alpha Prime or Earth, before they end up Lost in Space forever?"
4,Lost in space,"I ask moviemars about this movie. Amazon says it will be released in Sept, yet, moviemars has it now, why?They just blew me off without an answer. I ordered it any way, if it is not a good copy I will send it back.They do not seem to care about the customer, only the money. I will probably not order any more movies from these moron? They say it is from the studio, but, if it is so, why does Amazon not have it at this time. I hope it is notpirate copy?"
2,Good - Not Great,"It could have been better, just by using story lines that have been used and re-used. That would have been more entertaining. Its based on the 1960's TV show and copies the events of the first episode, so they could have made a sequal that could have been better. The Robinson family launches into outerspace on a pro-longed foyage, only their course is altered because of excessive weight from a stow-away, the infamous, selfish and trouble making Dr. Smith. They wake early from stasis and know only that they don't know where they are. Great concept, just very poor execution."
3,gets even more lost than the robinsons,"Great premise, great story, interesting effects, until.........they introduce the totally stupid twist with the 'time warped' Will Smith etc. Even for a sci-fi movie it was totally absurd, and the film losses sense and direction for me."
4,"Very entertaining, but...","...This movie made me uneasy for a few reasons. For example, how on earth can you travel THROUGH the sun without being burned to cinders? Also, Dr. Smith was a tad bit more homo-pedophiliac than he was in the t.v. show, and it kind of made the scenes with him and Will kind of creepy. And finally, the spider-ish version of Dr. Smith was just plain scary. It was probably the most unappealing thing I've ever seen. Very scary, and very realistic, which made it even scarier. A metallic human spider-type thing? What was that all about? Finally, it was kind of hard to follow. In the theater I wasn't able to pay close attention, but upon watching it later, I tried harder, and it was just as confusing. If you blink during this movie, you'll end up on Mars."
4,A pretty good movie; a great DVD.,"Not a big fan of the transfer of old TV series to feature films (what's the matter, Hollywood witers getting lazy?), I was surprised by the effort made by this film. Instead of taking the sugery campyness of the 1960's show, they make it more real, giving it a dark edge to it. The storyline seemed to drift all over the place, as though the Robinson Family wasn't the only thing lost. But it did provide a good opening for any sequels that they may plan on doing. (Rating: ***)The DVD production is fantastic. New Line went a long way in creating a full pack of features and options, including cut scenes music videos, comentary, a game that can be played on any DVD player as well as several games that are accessable via a DAD-ROM. This is the second New Line DVD I've seen where effort was put in it's production. (Rating: *****)Average Rating: ****"
1,BORING,"Boring. All these actors could have done something better then this junky film. Reasons why because it was long, too descripitive and just plain dumb. ..."
5,Lost in Space,Nicely done. A updated Movie verision of the old TV series. Good action and special effects. I enjoyed this movie very much.
4,a nifty little space adventure,"Having never saw the Lost In Space series, I will only review the movie itself. Now some of you have bashed this flick simply because you didn't think it measured up to the tv series. For all I know, that could be correct. Still, I enjoyed this movie regardless of having not seen the series. The only con I found with Lost In Space is that even though it was slightly over two hours, it seemed a bit rushed. Even putting back some of the deleted scenes would not have added much more to the story although the deleted scenes were somewhat good. On the pro side, the casting was great and the special features are overall interesting. I am usually not a fan of space movies with the exception of star wars though I really liked Lost In Space."
2,Don't Waste your Money,"This movie is incrediably dumb! The characters are cardboard( the girl is the worst, NO personality, except as a sulky brat). The plot is okay, but if there's no one worth rooting for, then what's the use of having a plot? I gave this movie two stars because of good special effects and a cool soundtrack (I also sort of liked the beginning)."
2,Could have been much better,"I heard about this movie more than 8 months before it's release. I was very excited when New Line Cinema was sponsoring my convention and they were promoting the movie so far in advance. I just couldn't wait, and i waited and waited and finally I was ready to fall asleep. I really do feel sorry for New Line Cinema, I love the company, they put out some awesome movies(I think The Island of Dr. Moreau is under rated) But when they venture into big budget films they always flop. Here is the latest. The Story was straight out terrible. When are the writers going to learn that time travel sci-fi movies rarely work(Star Trek Iv being the exception). I can't totally complain, because the movie did have some of the best special effects. Although they don't translate to TV very well. If they do attempt a sequel, lets hope they do better(Remember Star Trek: TMP, then came along The Wrath of Kahn) Keep trying New Line."
2,"Once again, great effects... and.....","It really breaks my heart to see millions of dollars spent on superb effects, costumes, and sets, only to be mercilessly dashed to bits by a pathetic story. Why not go into a local university creative writing class and offer 15 thousand to the student who can write the best script??? Guaranteed to have a far better story that the one I was forced to sit through (saw the movie on a plane). Did I mention, it had great effects?"
2,"This is One Movie That Should Get ""Lost""","I had high hopes for this film, but when I walked away from it I was more than a little disappointed. The film starts off well enough, but after an hour or so, things get really hokey and the story never really seems to connect. The acting is terrible, the screenplay needs work, and the ending leaves you with an empty feeling. Even die hard fans of the show will be disappointed because the movie isn't too ture to the series. The only thing they have in common is the characters names are the same. Bottom Line, skip right over it at the video store."
3,Excellent movie poor story,"First of all, the effects are stunning. The quality of the picture however is so high that it looks like you're watching the intro for some new computer game( NOT a good thing). The sound, like the picture, is so detailed that it is out of sync on some DVD players. Latest generation DVD players doesn't seem to have this problem though. Personally I use a PC to play DVD's, and I had to run a couple of upgrades just to avoid skipping in the sound :(, now I no longer have a problem with neither sound nor picture.:) (Effects = 5 stars., movie = 1 stars, total = 3) My advice: if you're thinking of buying this DVD... wait till it's on sale"
3,blu ray looks great! ok flick.,"This one just tried to throw to much into one movie. The plot got lost a bit. The actors all did a fine job but they couldn't save this movie. Which was decent but came out the same week as titanic. Which sank this at the boxoffice! The blu ray looks outstanding though. It isn't a terrible movie, but much more of a solid understandable plot was needed. At the time johnathon harris was still alive and he liked gary oldmans version of dr. smith. and it is a highlight of the movie."
3,Wack,"Movie was long and just not well done. Had some elements that if expounded on would have could have worked.Made me long for the t.v. this leaves a bad taste in your mouth for a big screen movie.Don't buy, don't rent, try to catch it on your dvr instead when you are snowed in with nothing to do."
3,The movie is a disappointment to Lost in Space fans,"I had high hopes for this movie having been a long time fan of the original series. Unfortunately, although the movie uses the original series as a premise, it too quickly ditches what made that series special for so many people, and instead goes for a 90s special effects theme park ride approach. The characters which made the original series are pushed to one side, and the acting in the movie is very wooden. I would have liked to have seen a greater role for the original series cast, and wished New Line Cinema had shown a little more deference to the series. For example, when the Jupiter 2 lifts off from Earth, it looks pretty much like the original ship. But that is only the outer shell, which is crudely 'dumped' by the new Jupiter, which looks positively awful. This mindset then pervades the entire movie.Buy it...but don't expect much... I'm waiting for the original series to be released on DVD...Malcolm"
2,Just wasnt the same.,"I Bought this 2 years ago For my Kids, now its just sitting in my movie shelf...Box is all smashed up and written on((Thats the joy of having kids)) I liked to older one alot better then this one, ya sure it has better efects and its up to date, but cmon after watching this when you were a kid you wouldnt expect the people to be so diffrent, The Cast Reminded me Of Cheech and Chong, They were ""Up in smoke"" Lol if you see it you will know what i mean, anyways if you really loved the older Lost in space, like me, you would stay away from this at all cost."
2,Good effects! But nothing else!,"This movie had great effects, it had acceptable acting, but a stupid story line."
2,"Bad dialogue, poor acting, and wasted special effects.","The movie started with a great story line, but after getting to know the bratty kids, along with the computer animated monkey it makes you want to ask for a refund."
3,Long Awaited Lost In Space,"As a die hard Lost In Space fan of the 60's, I had been waiting decades for some sort of revival. The movie: Like most people have mentioned before myself, the effects were good. The acting was okay, I felt they did the best they could with what they had to work with. The problem I feel lies with the Director and the Screen writers. The Director wasn't committed to the movie project and the Screen Writers were obviously out on a lunch break! It's too bad they didn't use Bill Mumy's (the original Will Robinson) story line from his 1990's comic book version of Lost In Space, now that's a hit!! The movie is ""dark"" like the first Batman movie, correct me if I'm wrong but it's it written by the same person??!! I look forward to a sequel were corrections can be made."
2,Very poorly done,"I was disappointed in this film. After plucking down $20 to buy the dvd. The story was poorly written. The special effects were ok, but often seemed phony. There was so much more that could have been done with this film, and this disappointment is what they came up with. Also, I could not get the games that come with the DVD to play or load on my PC. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
4,1st half of the movie was great. . . 2nd half stunk.,"The movie was great until friends boy blew up the prometheus. From that point on the plot becomes unbeleivable. It is an example of the script writers not doing enough review of the science they use in the movie. (can we say Paradox?) The first half of the movie is an easy 5. second half is a 2, except for the FX."
2,"Great effects, less than great everything else.","If you like great effects , this film kicks.If you want actors who are awake to create characters you really care about, go see something else. This film has its own hypnotism about it. As much as I have thoroughly enjoyed the graphic wonders created throughout the film, I have fallen asleep both times I've tried to watch it . Once in the theater, once at home on video. It should've been bigger & played better.But given all its faults I like it."
3,Gotta love the Robot,"I'm an SF junke, and even though I was not born when the origional TV series was aired, I've seen a few of the reruns. This movie reminded me of the pilot episode (the best one IMO)and many of the clasic visual themes are here, the Jupiter 1 looking like the origional ship, the Robot and even the robot bay with the central lift to the bridge paid hommage to the origional. Pity about the storyline though, but again, better than the TV series. I love the Apollo 440 video though, just cant get the theme outta my head."
2,Not save as DVD version,"I had seen the unused pilot in the DVD complete series collection & it was in color. This version is not for some reason. Needless to say, I am disappointed. I wish the fact that both epesodes were in black & white had been part of the listing at the time."
2,Didn't enjoy,"Back when I watched this movie when it was first released, I remember thinking it was quite fun. I had the chance to watch it again recently, and was looking forwards to doing so. Unfortunately, there was very little about the movie to enjoy. The acting was weak, the characters uninteresting and under-developed, the plot was simplistic and the conflict not particularly exciting. The quality of the environments varied from obviously fake, to pretty nice looking. All in all, it was a barely okay movie. I liked it more when I was a kid."
2,Um.....yeah,"I was never a fan of the original ""Lost in Space"" TV show, so I didn't know what to expect when I saw the '98 film adaptation. Well, I'm not a fan of this film, either. This is not a fun sci-fi movie: the characters are dull and annoying (Penny and Will Robinson, especially), the acting is wooden (except for Gary Oldman), the dialogue is stiff, and the story is nothing special (and it does get way too complicated in the third act), and even set designs are not really interesting to look at. I'll give the movie credit for Oldman's performance and for its special effects, which are actually pretty decent. Besides that, this movie is really lame. It's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it's still boring, silly, and downright unenjoyable.Grade: 3/10"
1,.,"Thankfully, it barely seems necessary to insist that this is a terrible movie, but I will happily add my two cents to the trashing of it. Because in addition to all of the bad things already cited about this film, I for one didn't even like the special effects. Honestly -- I thought they were terrible. This disappointed me because I was at least hoping for eye candy, but the effects struck me as terribly, painfully computer-generated and tacky. And that stupid little cute creature they bring in, which serves absolutely no purpose other than introducing ""the mandatory"" cute creature, and which seems so pitifully superimposed on the screen ... geh. A waste of talent, money, film, and most imporantly, my time. : )"
1,Bad. Very very bad.,"Great opening titles. But then it all went down the tubes. I was very disappointed. But that's getting to be the norm. It's so hard to find a good space movie these days. In this one some kind of pink monkey thing turns up which is definitely a tone lighter than the rest of the film...as if it doesn't belong in this movie at all, which I suspect is the case. Lucas should ponder this point too: why bother computer-generating a character who adds nothing to the film? As to the story it lost its core audience somewhere in the middle, about the point where Will grew up and Dr Smith became a stick insect. A shame really, as Gary Oldman's exquisite Peter Cushing impression was really the best thing the movie had going for it. Do you have anything less than a one star rating?"
1,BAD BAD BAD,This movie stunk worse than 99 skunks in a dump. I hated this thing. I don't know what they were talking about. They could have spent all of that money they used to make this movie to cure cancer. Bad movie! AHHH! Change it! Change it!
1,Worst movie ever made!,"I don't know why people dare to patronize the works of Mr. Edward D. Wood Jr. when when big studios release high gloss junk like this abomination. The much hyped up computer FX look incredible phoney (it worked in Starship Troopers but not here) , the actors are pathetic beyond belief (Hurt and Oldman have never been worse), the story and dialogue only works in a so-bad-it's-good kinda way. This film is apparently made by ignorants with BIG dollar signs in their eyes. Gimme some cheap 50's AIP SF-flick anyday cuz this must be the worst movie (big/low budget)ever made!"
1,this Was One Of the Worst Movies I have Ever Seen!,"Just horrible. Hate the movie, hate the T.V. show"
2,A bit of good....the rest ...blah,Loved the cameo from the original castLike Gary Oldman's version of Dr Smith..a few good lines....not enoughWont even discuss the actress playing Penny...UG....waste of timeThe new Robot is a piece of junk...the rebuilted Robot...had some character.The rest...Don ...John and Maureen.....not bad....could be better.Lots of effects..CGI...lots of sets....but script is a little lame.Irwin Allen....we miss your stuff.Good for a view...every 5 years....
3,"An interesting, but not always successful film...","Lost In Space attempts to capture the tone of the original series' first season. Gone is all the camp and the hokey special effects that appeared in the original series. As a kid I thought the series was pretty weak, but an enjoyable diversion.The visual effects and production design are top notch, but like most latter day Hollywood productions, the script is light on characterization. The first hour works fairly well before becoming a run of the mill television movie.William Hurt is interesting casting as the father. His intrepetation is unique to say the least and very disfunctional. Gary Oldham plays the role of Dr. Smith as if he is channeling the original actor from the series.On the whole, there are a number of dazzling set pieces, but the whole is less than the parts."
1,THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!,"If you value your time, then don't waste it on this corny, slow, and unbarebly stupid remake of the show! by far, it is the worst movie I have ever seen! ""LOST IN SPACE"" IS A DISGRACE TO THE MOVIE MAKING INDUSTRY!!"
1,Worst sci-fi film of 1998,"Lost In Space is probably one of the worst science fiction films of all time. It's a film that has absolutely no direction. Instead exploring more the director and screenplay writer decide to see how many loud sounds they can make. I still don't see how this movie got a PG-13 rating. It has even less action and violence than Star Wars. The performances by everybody except, surprisingly, Matt Leblanc, were terrible. Heather Graham and Mimi Rogers, who are very good-looking, deserve better material, but they could have tried harder."
3,Worth a look.,Some great action and special effect sequences but far to many plot holes. Not a complete waste but don't pay full price for it. By now there should be plenty of previously viewed copies in the bargin bin at your local video store.
1,"Ummmm, what to say....","Working at a prison on the midnight shift, you have to find things to keep yourself awake. I found one of the inmate's books from the library, and it just happened to be ""Brandenburg"".It was barely engrossing enough to continue to read it. It has too much explaining about the scenes; right before Volkman tortures someone for info, the author describes the cold night with wind whipping off of the black water. Who cares? Also, anytime he (the author) brings up Erica, he has to mention at her beauty. Not that that is bad, but reading this over halfway through the book gets kind of old. I haven't finished this book yet, but I am uite sure that I will be disappointed. I agree with the other reviewer that talked about who financed the trip, and how stereotypical the characters are, how he is a Jew and she is a daughter of an SS officer. Ugh...."
3,A Major Dissapointment!,"I had previously read the other Glenn Meade books ""Snowwolf"" and the ""Sands of Sakkara"" and found them to be excellent writings. Brandenburg is not in the same class as the other two writings. The book is is essence about the creation of the Fourth Reich. I had hoped foe something on the caliber of the ""Holcroft Covenant"". This book does not come close. The book was drawn out trying to get to the point.The action rating in this book was also nearly missing. The heros and villains in the book were also as weak as water.All in all the book was dissapointing. Every author is due one bad book. This is Glenn Meade's. I hope that his next one is better."
2,Read Snow Wolf instead,"After reading Snow Wolf, I looked forward to diving into Brandenburg. Somebody drained the pool. The pace was turgid, the characters - for the most part - shallow and the plot contrived. Even Meade's skill with the language seems to have deserted him. Everyone's eyes either sparkled, were knowing or were intelligent. The weapons all ""exploded"" in the shooter's hand. This was a plot which limped forward on its cliches. On top of that, the editing was abysmal. Treat yourself to Snow Wolf if you haven't read it yet, but don't waste money on Brandenburg."
3,The Nazi's are coming! The Nazi's are coming!,Run of the mill thriller that mines all the same ground that other thriller writers have already picked over. Nothing new is said. The good guys win (though way too many die!). And those Nazi's down in South America are foiled again.Believable => NoFun => Most of the TimeA good summer vacation read.
2,Read Snow Wolf Instead,"I was dissapointed in this book. I read what I thought was Glenn Meade's first book ""Snow Wolfe"" and thought it was excellent. I couldn't wait for his new book to come out and when it did I could not understand why it was so boring. No thrill in this thriller! Then, while perusing my favorite used book swap, I encountered an old copy of ""Brandeburg"", published in England in 1994 by Coronet Books. It was a little different than the ""new"" Brandenburg, but mostly the same (written by Glen Meade in case your thinking something bad here). So, this was another publishing attempt to recycle an old book into a new one. Now I understand! Why they didn't just mass market it in paperback like everyone else, I will never know!"
2,Unoriginal and unexciting.,"Glenn Meade has done an incredible job of making an attempt to resurrect the Third Reich into a boring, run-of-the-mill thriller. Most of the novel tracks the protagonists, a half-Jewish British agent working for the EU's security apparatus and a Paraguayan police detective, as they work along a threadbare string of clues that link a brutal murder in Paraguay to a neo-Nazi coup d'etat in Germany. A few exciting moments punctuate this Boys From Brazil knockoff, but with characterization that makes Ian Fleming look like James Joyce, it wasn't enough to sustain my interest.In an afterword, Mr. Meade states that some details of his plot (not to give anything away) are grounded in fact. I'm not sure if he's trying to be cute or if he's serious."
2,Brandenburg,"A fascinating story of incredible events. There is repeated and glaring lack of logical sequence, reasoning or analysis. Bothersome repetitious phraseology with seemingly endless cliches. Totally shallow. In short, a cheap thriller"
1,"Slow, boring and uneventful.","Brandenburg by Glenn Meade is a slow, boring story with a plot that is hard to follow since I put the book down a lot. I was very dissappointed, the premise seemed very interesting since I generally like books of this type."
5,atmospheric thriller!,"this is a classic thriller that pits a international policeman,a lovely reporter against evil conspiracy to start the fourth reich.Meade's sinister premise is backed with exotic atmosphere, violent action, plot twists and some really nasty villians that leads to chilling conclusion that will make you pause and think!"
1,Boring,"I read this book and like a previous reviewer could not finish it no matter how many times I tried. I do not know how the Amazon thriller editor, Booklist, or Kirkus could write such ss wonderful reviews. It was misleading and dissapointing. Read the Spear of Golgotha by Richard Greenwald THAT was a real thriller. It really makes me wonder why and who makes what decisions as to how much money is put into marketing and editing and chosing what gets published. Especially at the publishing house that let Brandenburg onto the shelves. Snow Wolf was great."
3,"not the greatest,","I have to agree with one other reviewer who said this book was easy to put down. I certainly wasn't compelled to reach for this at every reading session; it didnt intensely hold my interest, and I wouldnt describe this book as a real page-turner. There were so many minor characters too that I found myself flipping back pages to jog my memory as to who was who or what was that person's role again. In any event, the excitement and the action sped up toward the end of the novel. If you like spy stories especially dealing with possible Fourth Reich resurrection plots, you will probably enjoy this in spite of it's shortcomings."

2,Melatonin on the double,"St. Martin's has the clout to get reviewers and book peddlers to push a slowly paced sleeper with the thrust of a Saturn rocket- Only in America, where publishing is as deftly engineered as the Lowinsky lip service and Jerry Springer's jive. Go to Australia for a read that'll keep you turning pages to a beat that'll put a smile on your face-spear of golgotha. I bought that book-I wrote it too."
5,Easy to install,This UPS was fairly easy to install and did not take long to set up the monitoring software. I would recommend using it.
2,unboxed version doesn't have subtitles,be aware that the unbox'd version (digital download) of this doesn't have subtitles or closed captions of any kind. So unless you're well versed in old english it's pretty much worthless. I gave it 2 stars because it does have a kind of musical rhythm to it that makes it pretty decent background for a day's coding.
4,mixed review,"Very quick...I teach adolescent boys at a residential facility. These boys did not like it at all, big mistake on my part showing it to them. In fact, we didn't even finish it due to the complaining. I, on the other hand, was captivated. After awhile I didnt even read the subtitles, I just enjoyed the performance."
3,Beowulf,Not at all what I expected. This is not a movie. It's a guy playing a harp singing the old English Beowulf - yuk.
3,Haunted History Volume 4,"Haunted History visits Tombstone, Washington, D.C., Savannah, Hawaii, and Chicago to find out the local ghost. Chicago forgets to mention it's most famous ghost, Resurrection Mary but you can find it on the much better dvd Unsolved Mystery's Ghosts Stories. I watched most of the dvds but I found it just too damn boring and most stories seem rushed and could have been fleshed out more. If your a fan of ghost stories I prefer you pick up A Haunting or Unsolved Mystery's Best of Ghost Stories. I believe Haunted History did visit most of all the states just type in Haunted History and a state on Amazon to find if they did your state. The will be releasing this as part of a ""mega-set"" and i'd recommend that instead if you must buy the set."
2,Not a page turner for me...,"I can usually devour a good book in a day or two(if there is enough time in my schedule). It took over two weeks for me to read, and it felt like a chore. I found myself skimming pages, simply to get through the book. I read the reviews and was excited to read my first Madeline Baker. The book felt preachy toward the end, and I could see almost every plot twist coming. Neither of the characters were intriguing to me."
5,The most romantic book I have read in a while!,This book describes everything I look for in a man. No book shows that easily. I fell in love with Dalton also. It is truly worth reading. I own it and I know I will read it over and over. I wish she would write a sequel...its spectacular.
5,my all time favorite book!,"This book caught my interest from the very first page and kept me hooked throughout the whole book! I love western romances with a ""bad guy goes good"" theme. The ""ghost"" twist made it different from others. I love anything by Madeline Baker, but this one is definitely my favorite!"
1,"Glorious Julie, Bad Arrangements","As much as I love Miss Andrews, I must warn you against this album. The selections are fine, and Julie is in fine voice, but the instrumental accompaniments are agonizing. Imagine the worst in early eighties bad synthesizer. Then imagine the painful contrast of Julie's crystal voice and that awful background noise. If they could remix this, isolate the vocals, and then replace the synth with a simple piano, bass, and drum combo, it would be great. But as is, I just can't bear it."
1,half a star.. if that..,"I've heard some of the greatest stars stumble with albums, but I havent heard a ""stumble"" this bad before. When we think of Julie, we of course think of glorious arrangements featuring The London Symphony Orchestra or something wonderful like that. Love, Julie falls flat. Highly dated orchestrations featuring the really BAD '80s synth and drum machine almost to the point it makes you sick. The only worth while track on the album is ""What are you doing the rest of your Life"" Julie is perfection on that track. I bought this album thinking it might be worth listening to... but I cringe at ""dated"" music. Julie is superb, her voice is as it always was ""Superb"" but this album falls flat.Dedication needs to be put into to reorchestrated this work and making it the gem it rightfully should have been."
1,Poor production,"I couldn't agree more with the review by Richard Roberts - that the arrangements are cheesy, sounding just like he said ""bad 80's synthesizer"" (for a similar effect, listen to ""Dionne Warwicke Sings Cole Porter""), but I have to disagree with him regarding Juile's voice: it's not that her voice is in bad shape, though it's certainly not as supple as you're used to it being, it's just that the arrangements are WRETCHED, and some song choices (Big Mistake: ""Nobody Does It Better""), are ill-matched to her voice and her style. She's simply NOT the singer to interpret modern songs, though she's game. I also wonder why someone, anyone, didn't bring it to her, or someone else's, attention that a few notes were...well...off. I know this album was hardly an expensive, lavish production but shouldn't someone protect an artist from making mistakes like this? Anyway you slice it, this is pretty bad."
3,It's The Thing from Hell instead of Another World.,"Loosely connected sequel to Sometimes They Come Back and Sometimes They Come Back Again plays the Thing from Another World game as a military rescue team (of only two people!?!) is dispatched to an Antartic drilling station. Seems the miners broke through to hell...and something wants out. For low budget schlock this plays fairly well, no real surprises, but director Daniel Zelik Berk manages to craft an eerie moment or two amongst all the to be expected satanic hokum."
3,ARCTIC ABSURDITIES,"This movie has to have some of the worst outside snow scenes in cinematic history---you can't tell anything what's going on. Inside, things are not a whole lot better, but this thriller does have some unexpected plot twists, including one with Max Perlich who portrays the resident pain in the neck. Clayton Rohner in the lead tries hard, but can't overcome the script's many discrepancies. Emmy-winner Faith Ford looks completely lost in her role as Jennifer, the doctor, and Chase Masterson as Rohner's sidekick gives her Sigourney Weaver imitation. Damian Chapa as Schilling possesses a nasty smarm that belies his good looks.Not a total waste, but you might want to rent it in lieu of buying."
3,"Pretty Good, but on DVD?","This is a pretty good horror flick, I rented it a while back and it was pretty enjoyable.I could see where the director/producer was trying to elevate the film up from its ""Creature Feature"" underpinnings with an interesting plot, and he/she succeeded in some respects. Unfortunately, the obviously small budget of the film coupled with it's setting kept the film from being really interesting."
3,Sometimes They Come Back for More,"As for the movie title I can't say I always go back for more on most these B horrors, but this one I will. Sure it looks like they borrowed heavily from John Carpenter's 1982 version of ""The Thing"", but I loved that movie and I don't mind that they did. I always felt there should be more books and movies about remote settings like that. It makes a great setting for mysteries, SciFi, or horrors especially. Besides this movie is about a bunch of Satanic zombies trying to get a couple people, not a single alien terrorizing a group of scientist. After seeing this on the SciFi channel I came here to order it as it is reasonably priced even for a new copy and with Amazon prime shipping I consider it a bargain. If you enjoyed this, catchTerminal Invasion.CA Luster"
4,Its a pretty good one not the best,"I rented the movie and I havn't seen the first three but this one was pretty good. It wasn't the absolute best horror film but good pace of the movie, good plots and story line. I don't recommend going out and buying it righ away cause you should rent it first and decide for yourself."
3,Disappointment with Death,"I, too, was disappointed in the drastic changes to the storyline in this version. What was the matter with the way Christie wrote it? The characters were totally different, including unnecessary additions (the nun, Lord Boynton) and the plot was barely recognizable. The nervous downtrodden children of Mrs Boynton (Lady Boynton in this version) are portrayed very differently in this rendition and don't seem to fear her much at all. And they made her character some sort of financial mover and shaker, which contradicts her pathetic failure to dominate a larger sphere that is central to the original version. Finally, why could the story not have taken place in Petra as it did in the book? (I was looking forward to the scenery.) I thought Suchet's portrayal of Poirot was good, as always, and to be fair, perhaps if I did not know the book, I would have enjoyed this movie on its own terms."
2,What happened?,"I must say I agree with all the other viewers who dislike this adaptation. It is not how Agatha Christie envisioned it in her novel and I did not care for the dark, brooding Poirot in this production. David Suchet is my favorite Poirot but I prefer the Albert Finney version of Murder on the Orient Express because at least the Poirot in that production is not angry and dark. I love a sense of comedic release added to murder mysteries because it lessens the tension at the right times but there was no comedy in this at all. I would rather see Poirot as the ingenious character that he is instead of this dark man he is portrayed as here. I wonder how Suchet felt with such a production?"
2,Avoid Appointment with Death,It's deadly. The child abuse flashbacks just don't stop. APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH is the first film in the David Suchet Poirot series that I didn't like.
5,Astounding,I really am surprised but I think this season was done very well. You could say the new episodes are different than the really old ones. But I find these excellent!
2,NOT OKAY,"I could not believe how they had changed the portrayal of Poirot- NOT, NOT, NOT a religious man in any of the books. In fact Agatha Christie never ever brought up even her attachment to the Church of England in her stories. Did her family even okay this? I was so disappointed and, of all the DVDs I will purchase with this wonderful actor, David Suchet, this one I will NOT purchase ever. Its so wrong. Better to see the silly one with Albert Finney from the 80's or read the book!The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it was beautifully filmed and the other actors were interesting."
1,Horror,"I just took it from the library but I will never buy this horror movie.All these ""new"" versions are produced by sick individuals, all they want to see is violence and blood.So NO."
5,The Best CD,"This CD is the best that I've ever heard in my life. Rita Lee and Roberto de Carvalho are the best musicians, rockers, composers. Their work is unquestionably wonderful!! In this Cd you can enjoy the best of their career. Her lovely and perfect voice with His amazing arrangements improve their greatest lyrics. Once more you can see that Rita has really changed over the years, but just get better every CD !!!"
5,"Important ""deconstruction"" of the Qur'an","Burton does essential, thankless spadework in unraveling the convoluted and conveniently forgotten (by conservative Islamists especially) early decades of Islamic and Qur'anic textual history. He thus begins the same process that Biblical scholars began more than a century ago in looking at their ""holy book"" in the cold true light of history, reason and science.It is about time."
2,Collection of the Qu'ran,"John Burton attempts to outline the history of the collection of the Qu'ran. He starts by calling all the Muslim Sources of the history into question, this he does semi succesfully. He then goes on to reject the Mulism sources, leaving scholars with absolutely no sources with which to base the history. This leaves him a blank canvas where he can paint his own picture, without having to ever rely on evidence. His hypothesis, that Muhamed himself was the first collector of the Qu'ran, is just about the only one not found in any hadith collection. Needless to say, his argument for the early codification of the Qur'an fails miserably. In addition the book tends to rely heavily on technical language which makes it inaccessible to a beginning student of Islam."
2,Don't read for knowledge about the Qur'an,"Burton makes very clear his hostility towards Muslim sources very early on. His argument seems to be constructed more to find an excuse to reject these sources than to actually reconstruct the history of the collection of the Qur'an. He some how ends up at the conclusion that the Prophet(pbuh) collected the Qur'an in the form we have today. He rejects the knowledge of alternate early versions of the Qur'an as a fiction, invented by early Muslim scholars. While he does have a good critical knowledge of the early Muslim sciences, the conclusions he reaches are untenable. In addition recent research done in Yemen has found several very early Qur'an codexes that appear to be the very alternate versions that Burton rests his thesis upon rejecting."
1,Reject all orientilists,"Reject any ideas of early ""versions"" of the Qur'aan ever existing. Only the Salafi groups pander the alternate versions of the Qur'aan nonsence. Does any Muslim know of any sahih hadith from the Prophet[saw] which says this doctrine is true ? The Qur'aan itself rejects this idea of changing texts, ""No falsness can come to it in open or stealth.."". Whatever alternate versions of particular verses may be found are all probably scribe errors, since the Sahabi themselves organised the final definative arrangment of the text and suras under Caliph Uthman."
4,A quirky interesting read,"I really liked this book and was blown away by the ending. A facinating read, that was a little surprising."
1,Nice Try...Move On,"Please don't waste your money. This CD, though an admirable effort by a vocally talented artist, is one of the worst attempts at a breakout album ever recorded. The simple lyrics and dated, electronic sound might pull some weight overseas, but the good ol' U.S. of A. will not embrace mediocre writing spliced with poorly synthesized accompaniment. ""Just close your eyes and count to two/dive on in just me and you""??? Who counts to TWO? Why not ""Just close your eyes and count to three/dive on in just you and me""? And who can overlook the cheesy phone conversation played at the beginning of one of the songs? Come on, Mr. Thomas, we know you can sing. Now prove that you can write."
1,It's...unique,"Seth Thomas is really named Seth Grugle. He is a funny boy. This CD is fairly corny. He made a star out of himself at the Garland Civic Theatre. He will remain at the Garland Civic Theatre. His CD would make a great coaster, or nice addition to your stack of AOL trial disks. Don't forget, his real name is Seth Grugle."
1,Its Windex,"My tint was horrible. So i bought this. It really did nothing. i did all the work i scraped at it for hours. PAIN. so i used a water bottle because i ran out of the stuff in an hr because the bottle is so puny. Water worked just as good. Blade that came with gets loose and continually falls out POS. But needless to say i got it all done. All it is , is ammonia just like any window cleaner rip off. It says to let it set so i did nothing happens its says you may have to do it more than once i did nothing happened so i just started scraping, so i got it done."
2,Technical Difficulties,"Unless you're mathematically inclined, this book is going to be difficult to follow. I read the first few pages and gave up."
1,Waste of money...,"Didn't learn anything, most of it was super obvious on dumb tips on how to find a mate that I could find for free on the internet. Save your money & just google the info."
2,Beware you will not get what you see,Update - the picture has since been updated and now correctly reflects the product. However I still liked the old style rubbermaid pitchers better :-(I was somewhat hoping to get the exact pitcher shown in the picture. However Rubbermaid has discontinued this style and what you get is the new style Rubbermaid pitcher that is much inferior in many ways:1. The volume of the pitcher went down from 2.25 qt do 2qt which makes it almost overflow if you mix frozen OJ exactly to the instructions2. The design is now somewhat tapered instead of exactly cylindrical which makes it more difficult to handle3. The design of the lid is completely awkward - the old ones could be turned 360 degree with ease but the new ones have notches that make turning the lid for opening and closing a lot harder4. The lid does not provide the same tight seal as the old ones did.The seller should update the product picture to reflect more accurately what you will be getting.
4,These are ok,"Just like some other reviews, I found that the lids on these are hard to turn, in fact you musttake them off and turn them to close the spout. My husband scraped off a little of the plastic andthey are easier now. These are the only 2 quart pitchers I could find to replace very old ones."
4,good buy but not secure cover,"Splashes if you shake juice in it to mix, even if you hold the cover down. Pretty good though for the price"
2,be careful if you wash this in a dishwasher... shirkage!,"the lids no longer fit the pitcher due to some serious shrinking going on... bought these for our hotel/restaurant and ran them through our commercial dishwasher once, and that was all it took... poo poo"
4,Great for the price,If all your looking for is a decent pitcher with out the extras this is great for the price. It is just what you need and nothing more.
2,very disappointing,A bunch of recycled songs...they are tight songs but I have already heard most of them and own most of them on other albums. I heard the movie was good though.
2,Disappointed.,"I was extremely disappointed that there was no step counter, yet the booklet that comes with it talks about step counts. I also found that for a certain amount of distance, it didn't register any more distance. I took it off my belt at mid walk and clipped it on my pocket. Now, looking at the review of ""juicemonster"" I realize now that the pressure of my sweater and jacket over the device had probably reset it.Spend a few more bucks and get the Omron HJ 112. The reviews are excellent.If you already own it and don't want to buy a new one, either clip it on your pocket (your body goes up and down with each step unless you're an accordion), if you wear it on your belt, do not wear anything over it or it will get reset."
2,I really regret buying this,"I went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers. I really didn't know which one to buy so I bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so I thought it was better somehow. Even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging, it doesn't actually display it. It only uses it to calculate the distance that you've walked. I was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked. I got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket. I'm just going to buy another pedometer. One that displays the steps walked and has a cover."
1,Not good for running,I wish I never bought this item. The milage is completely inaccurate for running. I tried measuring my stride...still couldn't get even close to an accurate milage reading.
1,waste of money,"this is not a distance pedometer, it only measures steps, they give you a little booklet, and you have to look up how many steps equal a mile. I am returning it."
3,Best Chapters are Free,The best chapters of this book are published in PDF format for free on the web.
1,Too scientific!,"This book makes romance out to be like a math equation- boring and planned out! I thought it was a horrible book and a slow read. Plus, the author has misquoted other Long Distance author's I have read. For a guy who seems to think scientifically, he's got his facts all out of line."
5,Good selection,This book was recommended by a friend as one of the best books she ever read. She is an avid reader and I am glad that I was able to find it through Amazon.
5,Serengeti Trento Sun Glasses,"Bought the Sun glasses from Amazon $95. They were listed at Big 5 for $160 and then went on sale for $49. Lessons learned watch the Big 5 sales then Buy, Buy, buy!"
2,Classical Lesson,The video was recorded from a introductory type of seminar. The examples are classical without meat. I'm glad that I only paid for a few bucks from Amazon.
4,"Patterns for Guernseys, Jerseys & Arans","This book is a combination of history and knitting class.As a history book it is brilliant, alive and sentimental.It is also a wonderful knitting book except, I do believe you need to be a very experienced knitter to attempt these patterns and the language used in the instructions may be a little confusing.I consider myself to be a very good knitter but I think this book requires another ""picture"" book to give more visual help to those of us who need to ""see"" rather than read instructions.A wonderful read all the same."
5,A gansey knitter's bible,"I knew of this book before purchasing and when it arrived I was not disappointed. Gladys Thompson does a wonderful job of guiding a competant knitter through the tricky parts of making Cornish fishermen's sweaters (Ganseys,Geurnseas and Jerseys). Her knitting instructions are mixed with interesting history of the craft and I think the book is quite delightful."
4,"Patterns for Guernseys, Jerseys and Arans: Fishermens sweaters from the British Isles","This is a remake from a book written years ago. It has history of the sweater designs which is very interesting. The women didn't have set patterns written down, but are designs that have been carried down from generation to generation for a particular region. I would consider this book one for more intermediate knitters or those interested in history."
1,Aran Patterns and reviews,"This is a very interesting book, and there is knowledge in this book that makes the reader very much aware of how the patterns evolved, and when.I was pleasantly surprised and will mark it as among my favourites because of this knowledge. It really had me thinking about the people from years ago making up those terrific patterns and knitting them from scratch"
2,not a great training video,"I thought this video was about how the human becomes the dominant force or the pack leader. This video is more about how a pack of dogs controls and teaches a dog(s) in need of rehabilitation at his Dog Center. It also deals with humans overcoming their fear of large dogs.He spends an inordinate amount of time on a dog that is obsessed with rocks, but cuts to the end result two weeks later, without much information on how he got there. Although there are some obedience training tips, I found most of them vague. (i.e. when discussing how to socialize a dog with others when outside the home, it cuts right to the end where the dog is walking playfully and calm with the other dog. He does not say how to accomplish this at all.) It seems like it is edited quickly to the result , and Milan is patting himself on the back, a lot."
1,Not enough Information,"We returned this item. We had already ordered the complete 1st and 2nd Seasons. This DVD was full of Highlights of the 1st Season. Had we known this we would have spared Amazon the shipping costs both ways. As far as Cesar Millan is concerned, he is amazing. I would recommend thisseries to anyone who dosen't want to order the complete series."
5,highly recommend,"Cesar Milan works wonders with the dogs, amazing to watch, he explains it so everyone can understand it and better enjoy their dog."
5,Cesar,"is the greatest dog trainer ever, I've learned so much from him over the past 2 yrs. Thx 4 this"
2,Pretty Much the Same old Same Old,"There were some helpful hints in this video but it was pretty much the same message that Cesar preaches in all his shows, books and tapes. Somethings can be applied to your situation but others were way off base. I am of the opinion that one size does not fit all and this is the message that Cesar spins."
4,Bad game! Dont Buy!,Very bad game because it's stupid and very easy to beat.Don't waist your money on it you'll be sorry! If your wondering why i gave it one star it's because it has good graphics (The only thing good about it}.
5,A Great Deal,"I saw this watch at a local jewelry store, and thought about buying it. The only problem was the price. Then I looked here. Amazon.com offered the watch at less than half the price! When it arrived, it was in great condition. It keeps time perfectly, never needs a battery change, and looks great (I've had several compliments on it). I love it. I'll definately look at Seiko next time I need a watch--but, judging by the quality of this one, that could be a while. :)"
5,How do you spell great?,"As simple as that. It's great. It's different. It blows away tons of so-called noir novels. ""Los Angeles"" doesn't come from no snotty writing school, fellas. Strictly from the heart, this one. From the very first page you're hurled inside the personal hell of the main character, hoping for redemption. Peter Moore Smith's novel is literary, it's a page turner, it's lyrical and sometimes nasty, with a sad sad sad love story at its very core. How do you spell great, indeed?"
5,Excellent,"Peter Moore Smith has hit a homerun with LOS ANGELES. This novel does a fantastic job of capturing the misty nightlife and glaring daylight which constitute the dichotomy of the City of Angels. Nothing in this book is contrived or cliched, and you won't see the twist at the end coming 200 pages in advance.Give it a try and you'll be pleasantly surprised."
5,An Essential Truth,"Germaine Greer's courageous book THE BEAUTIFUL BOY shows the logical advance of feminism. Here we see one priceless result of eliminating the stereotype that only woman is beautiful. This is a landmark book of unimaginable importance. Dr. Greer writes about the emancipation of the woman's gaze and the great beauty of males at the age between boyhood and manhood. Forget the nonsense about pedophilia you'll read in reviews. This book is about the aesthetic trumping the reproductive sexual. It's also a corrective to men's history of art! Germaine Greer now stands beside the other great American feminist of of the past quarter century, Camille Paglia. Greer has opened the mystery. Look in with her for clues to the deep text of Eros."
2,Only One Beautiful Page,"I purchased The Beautiful Boy based on the cover photo, which is rather alluring, only to find inside a couple-a-hundred cupid paintings and Roman sculptures. Highly disappointing!"
4,They really are beautiful!,"The cover is misleading, but I, for one wasn't disappointed by the contents: paintings and sculpture, mostly, with a smattering of photos.In the case of *this* book, one might read the text out of curiosity, but if you choose to, beware; Ms. Greer, as has been mentioned, likes to 'court controversy'. It may offend.Politics aside, this is a gorgeous book for anyone who loves to look at boys. Adorable little boys with rosy cheeks, bigger boys just starting to mature, teenage boys in the gorgeous bloom of youth, and older boys on the verge of manhood. It is the *images* that are of the greatest value here. Not a bald head in sight. This book shows males in all their beauty (yes, beauty) and glory; a rare occurrence, yet a thing that has been done innumerable times in the case of women. Buy this gem of a collection and let them shine for you!"
3,Disappointing,"Germaine Greer does it again, and disappoints us once more with her bitterly distorted interpretation of the common place and obvious while presenting herself as the discoverer of something new and interesting. While at once extolling the beauty of growing boys she at once reveals her resentment at the reality of the adult male body, oddly dismissive of the fact that those boys will be such men in very short order indeed. We cannot remain puerile to suit embittered women unable to hold a sensible place in adult society. Trying the maintain their beauty as an ideal is doing boys no justice whatsoever. More work on their transition into manhood would have given this work some value beyond its shallow, superficial, low-end coffee-table presentation."
5,Another great book from the mother of 'The Female Eunuch',"Germaine Greer has done it again! This beautifully crafted and insightful book will most likely be cause of a controversy - which will assuredly germinate from the `conservative' circles - especially in the North America and particularly in the USA. Greer discusses a subject that had been for a long time, and still remains, a taboo. By discarding prudish notions of the early 19th century, Greer is spearheading a discourse on a long-forgotten (or may be forcefully suppressed) and admittedly important subject of the male body. Greer traces the image of the `young male body' through art, history and literature, she does it in a masterful and coherent language; this will be very useful to many students of Arts and Literature. This book is certain to make a great addition to any shelf, despite its size, unless of course you are Jerry Falwell."
4,K & N Conical Air Filter,"I have the FIPK on my '99 Grand Cherokee and ordered this as a back up to use while cleaning the one that came with the FIPK. It is and exact match. It could have been packed better, the hose clamp that it came with was inside of the plastic that covered the filter, and it put a few small ""dents"" in the filter screen. Not a big deal for me, it's a daily driver, not a show truck, and it won't affect the performance. For the price, I can't really complain, but this could have been avoided."
5,worked great,This part fit on my 5.7L LT1 with a custom elbow perfectly. I havent finished the car yet but expect this will help it flow better and add hp like any other application I have used a k&n on.
1,THIS IS NOT REAL BRAZILIAN MUSIC!,"I hope that people don't think this is ""brazilian music"", it is not, it is JUNK music for young teenagers and adults. It is cute, but what makes this group popular are the dancers. This group mentions their name in every song, the lyrics are brainless and dumb. I don't recommend any records of this group to anyone and once again this is not real brazilian music :("
1,Don't spend your money,"Think of another CD to buy. If you buy this one, you'll spend important money with pure junk music."
1,"IF I COULD GIVE NO STAR, I'D DO IT!!!","THE WORST!!! THE WORST!!! THE WORST!!! I could spend the rest of my lifetime writing ""The worst"" and you wouldn't have a notion of how bad is this record. If you like brazilian music, look for the right artists: Mutantes, Lenine, Walter Franco, Chico Science. If you love samba, try Cartola, Martinho da Vila, Chico Buarque. But don't throw your money in the garbage can buying this record!!! This group is the real cancer of brazilian music."
1,Que MERDA,"Isso nao e musica. Se voce gosta de seus ouvidos, nao compre esse CD. Mas se voce quiser ficar um retardado mental, pode comprar.... A unica coisa boa desse grupo sao as dancarinas. SÓ! Nao vou nem falar do gayzo que dana junto com elas tambem... Por hoje é só, porque nao vou perder meu tempo falando desse grupo terrivelmente horrivel."
4,The True Face of Harmonic Brilliance,"With this video, Take 6 shows you a side of the music industry that is very rare today: brilliantly versatile and influential sounds with a totally positive message. These six voices combine age-old spiritual passion with the complex artistry of modern jazz and pop music to create a purely angelic sound that would make the Almighty God Himself feel like dancing the night away. Truly a prized posession."
3,so so,"A fun read but many of the solutions can only be solved if you have a very expanded knowledge of everything, such as the natural habits of cows and turtles, etc. Also, many of the solutions are ""probable"" and not clear black and white solutions. It is still easy reading and worth the time."
