3,Crossing Over: Into what?,"A fascinating book, but kind of disturbing. You get this idea that Amish life is unbearable, when I really doubt it. For Irene, it was hard, because her father was so harsh, but I have met and known Amish and the men tend to be very gentle. Yes, it is patriarchal, but that does not make it automatically ""bad"".I would be upset too is my daughter, unmarried, slept with a man over 20 years older, twice divorced, disabled, obese and virtually unemployed and then ran away from home to marry him.I can see where they considered it adultery. I sympathized with Irene, and at the same time, I feel for her family. They are all between a rock and a hard place."
2,"Sometimes interesting, not well-written","This is a sometimes interesting, more often cumbersome read. The abundance of sentence fragments is distracting and made me wonder what her ""co-author"" did to earn his money besides interview people who wouldn't speak to her. The use of her estranged family members' personal letters at the beginning of each chapter feels intrusive; they obviously didn't give their permission. I'm a little skeptical of her husband's intentions, but she seems happy, so who am I to judge? Overall, this book is OK but disappointing."
5,Wow I love it.,I really enjoyed getting some facts from the other side about the Amish. I like all the fiction works I read about them but this was great hearing from a woman who grew up Amish but learned to live outside their world on lesson at a time.
1,worst book I've ever purchased,"Sad attempt at writing. I certainly do not believe this is anything close to what the average Amish family is like. I have read many books about the Amish and spent alot of time researching their lifestyle, etc. and I have a hard time believing most of this ""story"""
3,Crossing Over,"Ms. Garrett provides a heartfelt, first person portrayal of the issues she confronted in leaving her close knit family and Amish community."
4,cross over the amish life,it had parts in the book that did not keep your attention otherwise it was interesting
4,Amish escape,"This was surprisingly intriguing. I took it along to the beach, thinking my friend would like to read it, started it out on our balcony just because it was there, and didn't put it down until I was finished. A quick read, but it was interesting AND I learned a few things.I'm not normally ""into"" these types of books, but for some reason, I obtained a copy thinking I might, maybe, some day be interested in it, and I read it through in one sitting.The only thing I didn't like is that it doesn't really end. I mean, this woman is still alive and still on her life's journey, but the book was written in 2001, and it kind of just....stops. I would have liked more of a conclusion or something, I don't know.But I was interested enough that when I return from the beach, I will do some searching on the internet to find out what she and her husband have been up to since 2001. :-)"
3,"Somewhat Interesting Read,","The book was a quick and somewhat interesting read. The story line tends to be choppy and consists of vignettes of her life both as an Amish and as English. It begins with her returning to her childhood home to visit her parents, then goes into a series of flashbacks. The last chapter explains the visit, but there seems to be little conclusion to the book other than that. The book does give some highlight into the Amish lifestyle of the particular sect Mrs. Garrett is from. It helps remove the idealistic view many have of the Amish. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was not written to show the difficulty of escaping Amish life, but rather to give the author extra income. (This is suggested more than once in the book by her frank discussion of their financial situation.)"
1,This is a terrible book,"This has to be one of the most simplistic books I have ever read. It reminds me of one of those biographies written by a not-to-bright athelete ""as told to"" a mediocre small town newspaper writer. I think that Ms Garrett wrote the book because she needed money.Derek Bloomfield"
1,Unstructured drivel,"I read this book for a book club, and do not recommend it. It has no literary value, and does not even provide much insight into Amish life. Instead, the author gives only random recollections and gripes about the Amish. The book is loaded with filler--lots of excerpts of letters, blank pages, and wide margins to hide the fact that it has little content. Nothing about the writing is worth mentioning. The author leaves her life with the Amish to lead what sounds like a completely pedestrian and uninteresting life (living off of her older husband's disability pension). I cannot think of any reason to read this book."
2,A dreary tale,"This is a sad and strange tale of a woman who leaves an oppressive Amish family and community for a morbidly obese, thrice divorced, unemployable man who is 25 years her senior. I was especially disturbed when upon escaping in his van, this knight in shining armor hands her an electric razor and tells her she must shave her legs if she's going to be his wife! The author is young, and still very naive about the world. I'd be interested in reading a followup story ten years down the road when, hopefully, she'll have developed keener analytical skills."
2,Kinda Boring,"Not well written. Boring story, not orderly. Kept waiting for more in depth information. Wanted to learn more, but was left hanging."
2,Sad,"I enjoyed learning about the Amish people, but feel the writer was very young and naive and certainly DID NOT find her prince! I felt very sorry for her. Like another reader said...would like to see a follow up in 10 years or so and see if she still feels the same about her husband."
4,"Sensitive, with a good grasp . . .","of the effects of living in a rigid, legalistic, narrow society, and the horrific psychological warfare waged by those inside such a cult against one who has freed herself. Her sensitivity and analysis is very good. The book flows well and is a fast, fascinating read. My only wish would be that more insight be given to adjustment to the ""English"" world once she left. A book that is definitely worthwhile, and definitely does not warrant the narrow, angry review given by Mr. Scheffler. Definitely worth the time to read, and the time to realize that, indeed, the Amish constitute a cult within the Christian framework and definition of a cult."
2,"Another ""Made for TV"" script - light and simple","Ms. Garrett does indeed show intense courage to overcome the confines of her heritage. However, she only acknowledges the values of her upbringing quite sparingly. In fact, the only instance I recall some level of scrutiny and analysis is her comments on the crass commercialism of the ""English"" Christmas.The manner by which Mr Farrant has conveyed Ms. Garrett's story does not convey her internal struggles, other than her concern for her mother and resolve over her father's personality.In short, the story is a light and simple read where the narrator doesn't delve into the meanings of certain Amish practices and attitudes (e.g. materialism) but raises their significance only in symptoms as they apply to her. There is absolutely no ecunemical analysis or likewise introspection, however, that might be alright for the audience that Mr. Farrant intended the story for."
3,Crossing Over - whatever,"Ms. Garrett gives an interesting look at coming out of the Amish closet. But, I think we're comparing apples to oranges. Modern Life versus the old ways. What is missing is the evolution of centuries of pop psychology. That has evolved for our lives versus what she has today. She is expecting that evolution to have taken place in a closed society that only educates to the eight grade. Or, maybe she just wishes that they loved. Not sure. She is a little bitter about her previous life and I'm not sure her current lifestyle helps! Seems like she and her husband don't care for the Amish but aren't afraid to use them to support themselves? That may be a bit harsh - I don't know. She's had a very different life than any of us will ever know.Would I read this again or another work by her - yes probably. This is not a flowery cute little Amish Book. It is just like people in life. Not everyone is perfect."
4,Tranquility ATN (All-through-the-Night) Fitted Briefs Size Small,"I am certain that by design the product is just fine. I did not realize that my mother would fine this design confusing, compared to the pull up version that she is used to using. Unfortunately, I will have to try and give/sell this product to someone who can use it with confidence."
5,Hamilton Beach 62680 six speed mixer,Great product - great price - love that the speeds are different and not all the same like some mixers!
3,Reasonable but an introduction only,"The book is a reasonable introduction to project financing but falls short on many of the pratical details used in balancing risks, which is the essence of project financing.I was keen to see how the book covered the financing of port projects and I found that the authors summarised a 1998 publication By Drewry shipping without adding any new insights. Indeed the 1998 publication provides more pratical benchmarks and financing options."
5,Fantastic retro TV trivia game,"I've had this game for a few years now. It has about 15 TV stars who had a successful TV show, and ""Laugh-in"" announcer Gary Owens serves as the host. The celeb you pick will determine what TV show the first portion will be about. If you pick Florence Henderson, you'll be asked questions about ""The Brady Bunch"" as you might expect. There are other games you play in order to earn enough points to get a ""backstage pass"" where the celeb you picked will tell you a story about something that happened off-camera on their series.In addition to Florence, other celebs include Ed Asner, Loretta Swit, Davy Jones, Barbara Eden, Jerry Mathers (the ""Beaver""), and others. Some of the celebs have passed on, like Don Adams, Bob Denver and James Doohan (Scotty from Star Trek), making this game even more nostalgic and a sort of collector's item.The games are fun and if you were around in the 70s and 80s, this game will be a TV nostalgia trip for you. Get it, play it and have fun."
2,"Fun game, but you have to change 6 computer settings to play","I really enjoy playing this game, but you have to change 4 computer settings, and 2 Quicktime settings to play it, and that is a royal pain. Then I have to change them all back to the original settings to use the internet. I've NEVER had to do that with any software before this one, and I have a Pentium 3!"
4,Nice watch,It is a nice watch with an option to change the strap with a simple twist for wearing to different occasions.
5,Great Phonics Tool,This book is a great Phonics Tool.I bought it to teach my 4 yr. old the Phonetic rules and it has worked great so far. Very pleased!
5,Excellent product and excellent customer service.,This was a gift for my son and he was very pleased that it arrived so quickly in terrific packaging.
5,Euphoria Men Cologne,My son had chosen this specific cologne on his Amazon wish list. It was a much better price than at the retail stores. We were all happy with this selection!
2,Wore off way too quickly,"The fragrance disappear way too quickly. I bought this as a gift and actually asked by the recipient whether or not it was real or fake. Bummer! I had to question myself too. Sorry to say I don't know if I can our chase cologne/perfume from amazon. Guess i will be stupid and shell out the $$$ at Macy's and ""convince"" myself into thinking its the real deal."
2,Fading away too soon,"I purchased the tester version. I was told that buying a tester would be much better since the manufacturers add more of the concentrate to appeal to potential buyers. I had purchased other testers and I would say that it's true. However, not with this item. It does not last more than 15 minutes... I am even thinking I purchased a fake item, but I have no way to prove it. I guess I am paying the price of buying online..."
4,The smell is great and lasts a long time!,"I originally smelled this product on a coworker of mine and smelled awesome. I asked him what it was and told me Euphoria. We kinda made a job about it but then when I bought it for my boyfriend, it was truly euphoric. Awesome smell on a light note."
5,The perfect smell good!!!,Euphoria is the best. This Men's spray is perfect for a truesmell good and you cant beat the price.I am about to order another bottle. I only have a few spraysof this product left.
2,Dont Go by Brand Calvin Klein,Its always good to take sample packs first then buy some thing bug as the above . Every one have different choices and smell likes and dislikesI wont write any thing about the smell i feel but will advise to try it at a perfume store first them buy from the site ............
4,the scent!,"It took a while for me to find a scent I would like to wear. A lot of scents they make for women are too floral and sweet for me while many of the men's fragrances are too bold and, well, masculine. This was a nice balance between the two, and personally I could not stop smelling the magazine sample and the sample I got from Macy's. I wear it to work practically every day and whenever I go out somewhere, but the scent doesn't seem to project quite as much as I would have liked (which is why I gave this 4 stars as opposed to the 5 I so desperately want to give). Other than that, no complaints and it was a wonderful deal for the amount you get. I still have most of this bottle left after buying it nearly half a year ago, so if you are concerned about projecting this scent, then maybe apply more. 3-4 sprays and I can still smell it on me near the end of the day. I'm sure if you bumped that number up the scent might be a little stronger and stick around a little longer."
4,SCENT OF CONFIDENCE,IF YOUR LOW ON CONFIDENCE ON A DATE GOOD LOOKS CAN TAKE YOU FAR BUT GREAT COLOGNE THAT THE LADIES LOVE WILL TAKE YOU FARTHER WITH THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE WOO WOO WOO YOU KNOW IT CATCH PHARES BELONGS TO ZACK RIDER WWE SUPERSTAR AND CURRENT US CHAMPION. BUY THIS COLOGNE GUYS YOU WONT REGRET IT.
2,Smells good and then gone in 60 min,"CK's Euphoria is such a disappointment. It smells great but lacks all the other qualities a good cologne should have namely Projection (how well others can smell it on you) and Longevity (how long it lasts). Euphoria fades away after about 1 hr and you can maybe smell a small trace on you if you hold your nose right up to where you sprayed it. Nobody will know you are even wearing it unless you reapply every hour. I have never had this problem with another CK fragrance, but this is the common complaint about Euphoria. With the competition out there this one does not measure up."
2,Doesn't last,"My wife purchased this for me from Macys. It smells great, for about 30 minutes. Then there is simply no trace you're wearning any cologne whatsoever."
2,Not Euphoria,"First time I tried this, I thought..""This could be it"" ironically that was ""It"", the ""top notes/first scent"" of this cologne are really pretty good, but after about 30 seconds to a minute...the ""dry down/base notes"" begin....and the cologne becomes super weak and resides to close to the skin for anyone to notice, unless they are already into you....It's really only a cologne for winter months."
2,Synthetic crap that does not last.,"This cologne sucks. It smells sweet and synthetic. After about 10 minutes, nothing is there. Although the bottle is nice. Never again."
5,Great smell....great price,This exact same bottle size cost just about double every other place I checked! My husband loves the smell....great buy
5,Perfect for everyone who needs to pee...NOW,"My four children can't make it ten minutes down the road without needing a bathroom. This guide has made pleasant, low-stress road trips with them possible. The information is accurate, well presented, and up-to-date. Now we can stop at EVERY bathroom on the road.The thin paper isn't an issue for a publication with information that goes out of date so quickly. (Which is why phone books are made out of it.) If the paper is a problem, you can get a membership with their website and print out just what you need for each trip. I would recommend this to anybody who's taking a road trip on the interstates. Especially if you periodically need to pee."
3,Not complete info,We are motor home travelers and need to know if a service station and/or exit is big rig friendly in bold or red letters so we may find them quickly. We also need the rest stops to be highlighted for easier reference.This book is just not as informative as we hoped.
5,Don't hit the road without this one!,"I've bought several copies of this book. I really enjoy giving copies to friends as gifts. By all means, don't go on the road without your copy!"
5,Big help for Interstate travelers,"If your travels are routed on the country's Interstate system, this is a very helpful resource, fitting neatly into a car door pocket for easy reference.Need diesel for your truck or RV? This'll tell you which exit has it, and which station is accessible to RVs -- a helpful tip if you've ever struggled to maneuver your 35' vehicle into a tight turn.Hungry? Find a restaurant at the nearest Interstate exit.Tired? Motels are listed at those exits.Too much coffee in the morning? Check out how many miles to the next rest stop.This book makes travel via the Interstate system easily predictable and helpful. It's a permanent fixture in our truck now, even for short trips."
3,Useful,"We took this guide on just one trip to date from Augusta, GA on I-20 and then down I-75 to Naples, FL. It was like having more exit signs that tell you what to expect off that exit but much more comprehensively. If there were some indications of distances from the exit, it would be rated higher."
4,quite helpful,"This book is helpful to find gas stations and grocery stores. Sometimes it is a little ambiguous when it comes to the direction of travel or distance to the fill stations from the exit. Overall, it's a helpful tool to use when you are on more isolated travel routes. We recently traveled with another RV-ing couple that had a diesel-using vehicle. It was great for them to know which gas stations offered diesel fuel. I would like to see all Walmarts and similar stores listed in the book; I'm sure it would be too labor intensive to add the complete store listing. I recommend this book for those venturing out to places they've never been."
2,Disappointed,"It is printed on a very cheap paper (almost brown) and the binding is too fragile for extensive use in the car (it really should have been spiral bound). But, most importantly, the provided information is scarce and the content is poorly organized. It doesn't seem that the authors put much thought or effort into making of this book, especially comparing to other guides like 'Drive I-95: Exit by Exit'. I ended up returning this book."
3,Not as good as the former Interstate Authority....,"This does what it says, but there are two problems that the former Interstate Authority book had fixed. (unfortunately that book is no longer made)1. Instead of being organized by interstate, it is organized by state. So you have to flip sections if you are looking ahead to where an interstate changes states.2. There is not any indication of how far from the exit the place is. A simple (0.3N) would be VERY helpful.And there is a third thing I would like to see added:- Phone numbers for hotels so you can call them with a cell phone and see if they have vacancies.But even with these complaints, this works for cross country travel. It is much better than just guessing based on the size of towns.--Alan"
5,Don't leave home without it,"This book is even better than its' predecessor. Yes, the distance from the exit is included for the businesses that aren't so close and obvious you'd trip over them. Organization by state is the best - don't change a thing! We are RVers and are incredibly pleased that the RV accessible locations are easily identified in red. Couldn't imagine a better resource when you're on the road and want to pull off for any reason."
5,All Creatures Great and Small,"Actually, I own all of James Harriot's books, and they are all wonderful. If you are an animal lover, this author who was a Yorkshire vet tells the most heart warming stories.I was looking for a set of his books as mine are falling apart, and I feel that I will reread the series and would like a new one."
1,Did not work at all.,"After I purchased the product, the mice remained in the house and even might have increased in number. It was a terrible product."
4,Nice Shocks,"These shocks were originally set up for the rear of my dodge. I replaced the upper bushing in the shock so I could use it on my truck for plowing...giving the front suspension a little more stiffness as the plow puts 800 lbs on the front end. Worked great, except that they ride so hard, I need a new kidney transplant from all the harsh bumps I go over... Just kidding.I took them off, and installed nitrogen shocks instead. Much nicer ride.... although I'm saving these for when winter rolls around to put back on the truck if necessaryGood value Nice shocks."
1,One of the worst Cd's I've ever purchased,"If you've heard one Chris Ledoux song you've heard them all. Every one is about the Rodeo and riding a horse or a bull. The only people I could see enjoying this are rodeo clowns and the partially deaf. I love old Country... Hank Sr, Waylon Jennings, Hank Snow, Lefty Frizzell, Ernest Tubb, George Jones, Johnny Paycheck, shoot I even like some of the traditionalist revival singers. Randy Travis, Dwight Yoakam, Hank III, Wayne Hancock. But seriously..this CD is absolute garbage I only somewhat enjoyed on song on the whole album ""caballo diablo"". Don't waste your time here. He sounds like a Nascar driver with a cartoony voice that rides rodeo horses. 1/2 star"
4,Almost as good as Home Made Pickle,"I love to eat Pickles. Priya is one of the best pickle makers in India. Priya pickles are almost as good as home made pickles.This particular Mango pickle is very tasty. You can eat it with almost anything. A mixture of Dal, Ghee, Rice and mango pickle is my favorite. Make sure you don't eat too much of it, if you are not used to spicy food because this particular pickle is highly spicy."
5,SOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!,This guy is a freaking hero! He travels all around the globe saving abused chimps and works with them to get them ready to go back to the wild. He is talented and driven. Not to mention he totally speaks the chimps language and knows how dangerious they can be. He is not trying to make these animals pets he is trying to make them animals again. Someone should give him a humanitarian award. Oh and his show is fabulious....did I mention hes cute too? I get up every morning at 6:30am just to watch his show. PS I dont have to get up till 9am.
3,wasn't what I expected,"When I ordered this video, I thought I was purchasing the video but as it turns out I only rented it. Won't be doing that again. The video itself was of good quality."
5,I just Want to Celebrate...Mono never sounded better,"Bill Inglot does it again. The songs featured on this Hitsville box are the mono single mixes and they have a bottom to them that just pounds out of your speakers. The high's on the songs are clear and bright. In fact, at first listen I never wanted to hear these songs in stereo again. Just put on Love Child and listen to that bass drum slam down with a opening, thunderous boom!My only disappointment was not in what was on it, but what was not. Four discs are not enough. They should have given this the Stax/Volt treatment. Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, Marvin Gaye all are underrepresented. Also, the packaging lacks a little care. The back of the box lists the songs but not the artists.These aside, what is on hear is terrific and is worth every penny."
5,So Good it Needs No Review,"This collection is so awesome, that the only bad thing I can think to say about it is; it ends with 1971 so there are no later Temptation hits (Pappa was a Rolling Stone, etc.)For those of us who were around at the time, this collection immediately takes you back to then and there. Some of these songs, I had never heard with the clarity in which they were originally recorded.Nice ""found items"" too, like remembering that Rare Earth was one of the first, and only, predominantly white bands that recorded under the Motown label.A must-buy for all of us geezers who grew up listening to the music that came out of Berry Gordy's garage/basement."
5,First rate Motown boxed set,Classic cuts abound in this four disc boxed set. The biggest names in Motown soul are displayed here. A must own for any collector of early Motown and a great companion to Motown 2 (the later years).
5,Simply The Best!,"Five words? Go out and get it!.......If you're a TRUE music lover of heart, rythmn, and soul...it's in this box!!..Motown is infinite in being the progenitor of the sounds that travel through popping finger tips, patting feet, and swaying hips. These songs make you croon and swoon, they hold decades of memories of softer, gentler times and also of turbulent and trying times. But no matter the situation one could find one's own salve within these songs. With the world the way it is today, just listening to this set will reinforce the message that ''through it all, we can claim a melody and keep our beat''. Smokey, The Tempts, and all the others are not only classic, but artists with timeless musical class. They brought a generation a hope, a joyfulness, a spirit of achievement. These things should be in every generation. This is one way to make that happen. These artists, these songs are SIMPLY THE BEST!!!"
3,"Timeless, But Toneless....","You can not fault the music. The songs included here all deserve a special place in music history. However, the sound quality leaves much to be desired. Every track is presented in the original mono version (this is not mentioned anywhere on the packaging);and, if any of the songs were ""remastered"" I would be very suprised. If you want to hear this music like you did the first time, in AM radio mono-quality sound, this is a great purchase. It might be best to search out ""remastered"" greatest hits releases from some of the individual artists included here if you can afford it."
3,Collection of mono hits,Wonderful collection of music except for one thing. These are remastered originals and most are not in true stereo. Just listen with headphones
1,ALL IN MONO-DO NOT BUY!,"Do NOT buy this collection. While the song selection is very good I want to know why Motown could not and did not issue this collection in stereo when a great portion of these songs are available in stereo on other albums. This is a cheap ploy by Motown to suck in your money. The second Hitsville Box 2 is in stereo, but the song selection is poor. I repeat, if you want a quality box set collection that is well engineered and in stereo, do NOT include this one."
3,Too much not enough,"I wish there was a Motown box that omitted the Four Tops, Miracles, Temptations, and Marvin Gaye. Why? Well, because any Motown fan should have retrospectives devoted to all of the above (although I personally despise the Miracles, heretic that I am). Yet there are amazing tracks from lesser-known artists that remain unanthologized or unavailable. I guess that's why they invented iTunes. But seriously, this music should be given to every child at birth."
3,"Hitsville USA, A Real Disappointment!","OK Folks, I grew up with all these tunes and thought I would love this collection but when I discovered some of the songs repeated on each of the 4 CD's I immediately felt cheated. If they couldn't fill 4 CD's then why not just put out 3! Other than that the music brings back old memories so it isn't a dead loss!"
2,Same mistakes as Dad . . .,"Sarah Hudson is making the same mistakes her father made 30 years ago when he traded in self-respect to be a ""Monkees"" characterized entertainer on the short lived ""Hudson Brothers"" tv show. Now daughter Sarah is being dressed up and marketed, not in the feel good 60s vibe, but the current pseudo postpunk teen angst marketing gimmick. Already beaten to the punch by Fiona Apple and Avril Lavigne, she is behind the curve. Sadly, her immense talent, like her father's, will be lost because she cashed in on the misery gimmick of the movie ""Thirteen"" and ""Kids."" Now in her late twenties, she is still dressing up like a miserable high schooler. It is amazing that she has songs about being angry at her folks when a recent documentary shows her so close to her father. A song about how her folks mean to her really would have made her stand out from the crowd. Image over substance takes down another amazing voice. See you in the discount bins Sarah."
2,Yikes!,"Sarah Hudson's album has been compared to Skye Sweetnam's 'Noise From The Basement'. WHAT? There is no comparison - Skye Sweetnam has actual talent. While Sarah...What sort of lyrics are - ""I can't hold on forever/I know that you know I know"" and ""I wanna go shopping like Wynona Ryder"" and ""you better lock your doors/the bitch is back.""?""Naked Truth"" is not about the music. This album is about manufacturing a woman trying to be a girl, singing about things that she's too old to identify with. The tunes are trying their best to be hardcore - but they arent. Sarah is trying her best to be Skye Sweetnam - but she's not.Besides, Skye Sweetnam is actually a great role model for youngsters. Sarah is not."
5,Velvet Vocals !,"Sarah Hudson has strong velvet vocals, and this is a crunching CD that can't be missed!"
3,The Naked Truth on Sarah Hudson,"I'm going to review each of the songs:Naked Truth--Catchy, in-your-face song for graduates wanting to tell their story and insult their parentsGirl On the Verge--I suppose it is an okay song, but it seems to me that Sarah is just screaming throughout the whole songStrange--I like this song because it contains the pride of being different from everyone elseI Know--Great song! Especially with the background vocals from Steven Tyler who also appears on Girl On the Verge.Little--Another in-your-face song to her parents. Don't care for it that much.Unlove You--Too sappy for the album and her voice.Gandhi--Fantastic and fun song! This is the song I listen to when I need a boost.Call It My Life--anthem for the life of a womanSentimental Saturday--I could go either way on this track.Fake Rain--Two thumbs way down.Bad Habit--Sticks in the head, but that's the only thing it's got.Overall, a decent album and not one to be confined to the bottom of the Cd rack."
4,Makeup Mess Review,"Makeup Mess is a very good book! I liked it because it was funny to see how the character Julie, portrayed a real little girl. That is because the author wrote it about his daughter Julie. I would definitely recommend this book to little girls. I don't think little boys would enjoy this particular book. But since I'm all for kids reading at young ages, I would recommend the book Pigs. It too, is written by Robert Munsch! I think all kids will enjoy this book. Overall I think Makeup Mess is a very good book and deserves 4 stars!"
5,Kick A** Workout,"This is an awesome workout. Circuit training is the new, intelligent way to get in shape fast and this workout gives you everything you need to get ""shredded"". Jackie is great to watch and very motivating. I've exercised religiously for 20 years and it takes a lot to impress me. This one really challenges me and leaves me feeling fitter than ever. Love it!"
5,Jackie is an awesome trainer!,"I love all Jackie DVD's and this one is no different! She always incorporates the major muscle groups and keeps us in great form with weights w/o compromising safety. She always delivers a great, results oriented workout!"
5,This is a great workout!,This workout is good for all levels. Beginners can do one 20 minute work out at a time and the more intermediate and advanced can combine 2 - 3 worksouts per session. I started out barely making it through a 20 minute workout and now I do all three in a workout session! The results are great!
5,LOVE LOVE this workout!,"I loved this workout. I've worked out for many years to videos including Jari Love, Patrick Goudeau, Cathe and Amy Bento. Jacki is one trainer I thoroughly enjoy. I rarely look at the clock."
5,Great Instruction,"I love that this video doesn't have a long, mandatory intro like the Jillian videos. That really gets on my nerves after about the 5th time watching it. I also love that there are three included workouts, upper body, lower body and abs. You can select which you want to do at the beginning and it stacks them up for you. The camera angles are great and you get a clear instruction on how to properly perform each exercise. It's a tough workout and lots of modifications are provided to make each exericse easier or more difficult as you progress. I love most of Jackie's videos and this is another great addition that will have a regular rotation in my daily fitness routine."
4,Great workout!,"This workout is intense!! Jackie's motto is ""you can do anything for a minute!"". The only thing is that you do one exercise for one minutes and IMMEDIATLEY go onto the next one which is HARD but thats why its so intense. I pause it sometimes that way I don't miss out on the workout when I need a 30 second break."
3,Very over rated,"I watch the Bravo series ""Work Out"" and thank god that I do because knowing the back story behind Jackie and the trainers is the ONLY thing that kept my attention during this DVD. I thought that the filming was amateurish; the choreography was lame and neither Jackie nor her trainers could keep a beat to save their lives. If I was new to exercising and used this DVD as a guide, if I paid any attention to Rebecca, I would wind up with the worst form on the planet. I would also have no clue as to what I was doing because I felt that the explanation that went with each exercise was strongly lacking in detail. In summary, this DVD was a HUGE letdown. Boo."
4,Good workout!,"At first I couldn't get past the way the ""trainers"" looked, with their painted on abs and odd behavior. But I guess they are reality stars (which I didn't know before I bought the DVD) and they are in L.A., so I guess I should have expected the extra makeup if not the silly banter; but the workout is really good and I am sore after I do it. I really love the 30 day shred but we can't stick with the same workout forever. I would recommend this for anyone who needs something after the shred."
5,I really enjoy this DVD!,"This DVD really works you out! It is a great cardio/weight combo and I like that it is broken into three twenty minute segments. I do all three now and it takes the full hour, but as I tone and firm I plan to cut it back to core and upper body, then core and lower body. Her instructions are very clear and she helps you keep focus on your form while also encouraging you to hang in there! I would certainly recommend this video to anyone looking for a cardio/weight workout. As I said before, I really enjoy this workout."
5,Excellent Workout for Beginners to Advanced!,"This is an excellent workout for beginners and advanced (hard to find!) I've been trying to get defined abs all of my life, and I am finally seeing results with this video. I'd have to say that even after 2 children, my abs have never looked better. I finally have obliques and really strong lower abdominals!!The exercises can be challenging but each one is only 30-60 seconds long, so anyone can get through it. Jackie incorporates a bit of cardio after each strength exercise to get your heartbeat up, and it's also motivating to see the trainer's muscles while you're doing the exercises.You will be sore. You will be tired. But, you WILL see results!!"
4,This kicked my butt!,"I am a big fan of the Ripped series by Jeri Love but I have to say this workout from Jackie and her trainers kicked my butt and is a nice change of pace from the Ripped videos due to its flexible organization and the cardio intervals(Jeri Love also has an excellent cardio/strength video too...Ripped 1,000). My favorite section of WORKOUT is the abs segment! This segment is good for those days when I just feel like doing straight cardio but want to add an abs component."
5,One of the best Workout videos,"If you have limited time and want a great workout, this is it. Weight training is broken up with portions of cardio that work the same muscle group. You will feel the burn! Moves are simple & Jackie explains correct form, how, why etc. This is the mark of an excellent instructor. The music is great - not cheesy like say, Power 90 (which I also use). In this video, you basically do one minute of each movement, you can do it at your pace. Jackie Warner is tough, straightforward but friendly and likable. I never tire of watching this DVD as I have others.Coming back after an injury, I did all segments on this DVD and found that my strength improved even after the first workout. When you are working muscles correctly, they respond. What's nice is that you can break up Upper, Lower and Core into different days if you want, or do the whole thing. I supplement this DVD with power yoga and aerobics for a very well-rounded workout. Hope my opinion helped :D"
5,tough but attainable,"Really really good, not easy, easy to follow. I'm 52 and can almost do the whole DVD after 2 weeks, well maybe not the whole DVD - military push ups are impossible. PS I fast forward through the cardio. OK so I cheat. Jackie if you are reading this: I want to be one of the clients on your show - just think we could cater to the ""older"" crowd."
5,trying to be fit,This is a good workout for those trying to get in shape. There are ways to modify to make it easier or harder. This helped me to pay attention to my form and learn how to do it right.
4,mostly happy,"I was disappointed with the lower body part because it is mostly squats, which I try to avoid because of knee problems. The arm workout is great, and easy to follow. The abs part combines an abs workout with aerobics with makes it a lot harder than most abs workouts that I have done. But all of the abs exercises include an easier version which allows me to keep up with the fast pace. I do the arms and abs 2-3 a week, but use a different lower body video."
5,JUST WHAT I NEEDED!,"The best workout ever! I can't write anymore, I'm still recovering from workout N1 of this DVD..."
1,DVD did not work,I received this DVD but it only plays on one of my players and not on the other. I contacted Amazon months ago and still have not heard anything. You better try it on all your players as soon as it comes to be sure it works.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"BORING, NOT MOTIVATIONAL, TRAINERS WITH TONS OF MAKEUP, EVEN THEIR ABDOMINALS HAD BEEN RETOUCHED WITH MAKE UP. DID NOT DELIVER."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money On This DVD,"This is the worst DVD I have ever seen. Boring, non-motivational and just blah. No wonder there has been a lot of negative press about Jackie Warner. Look at LA RAG MAG. I was just very disappointed! Don't waste your hard earned money on this one!"
2,gimmick,"I tried this dvd and it isn't very good. Jackie tries to hard to be like Jillian MIchaels from the Biggest Loser, but she lacks all the caring that Jillian is famous for. This is a pass. If you are looking for an amazing workout 30 Day Shred by Jillian Michaels is the way to go.Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred"
1,Never received the workout DVD!,I have no idea what this one is like because I never received it. Very disappointed.
4,Good overall workout,"Workout: One on one Training with Jackie is a good overall workout. It is nice that the work out comes in 3 parts (arms, legs, abs), so you can customize your workout. However, the trainers are too stylized-their hair is too perfect and outfits too cutsie."
2,I have bought better ones,"I have watched Jackie's Bravo series ""Workout"" and thought to try her plan since you really don't see all that much exercise going on on the show. It's okay but I have bought better exercise DVD's like Jillian Michaels '30 Day Shred'. I think that Jackie needs to get back to basics and stop believing her own hype."
3,Lacked Something,I bought this workout because I like the show however once I got it home it was lacking. It is ok for beginners but I think Jackie is not the best trainer or motivator out there. It was just ok for me.
5,Great DVD,"This DVD is simple to use, effective, and can be customized. It comes with 3 different workouts (Upper Body, Lower Body, and Core) that are 20 minutes each. You can pick and chose which workouts you'd like to do, which I find very useful. The workouts themselves are simple and challenging, but not too difficult. Jackie is an awesome trainer and is easy to follow. I love when she says things like ""You can do anything for one minute"" because it just pushes you that extra step.All in all this DVD is great, I've been using it for a few months now and I've seen decent results. My only complaint is the lack of adequate stretching after each workout. Not a big problem though as I know how to stretch on my own. I look forward to Jackie's next DVD!"
4,Good work out,"I would say that I'm an intermidiate fitnes person. Overral it is a good video work out for me I do feel tired at the end and the excersices are not difficult to perform, my favorite is the core training. What i do not like about it is that she only works with one trainer at a time and the others are around sitting and watching, and the music is not very good."
4,"Great workouts, OK Trainer","I would recommend this DVD to anyone who's looking for a short, but intense circuit training type workout.Pros: She shows you how to modify each exercise with less intensity or more intensity. She focuses a lot on correct form so that you don't get injured. The person showing you the exercise changes every 5 minutes or so, so it doesn't get boring. Workouts are customizable so you can include lower body, upper body and core in the order you choose, using 1-3 workouts at a time.Cons: Jackie is a little annoying. It's obvious that she's into herself when she says in a couple of the segments, ""I could do this all day!"" The trainers who demonstrate the exercises can also be corny."
5,Love it!,"This workout kicks your butt and burns mega calories. I was a ""Firm"" believer, but their workouts just weren't buring the calories I needed. Jackie's workout burns double the calories compared to Firm's. A 20 minute Jackie workout burns the same as a 40 minute Firm workout. The exercises are challenging yet easy to follow. In 3 weeks I have definitely seen new definition that I did not get with the Firm workouts. It's fun watching her with the other trainers. This is good for beginners or advanced. Just add more weight to increase the challenge. There were new exercises I had not seen before and I love them!"
4,short but intense!,"The good thing about this workout dvd is there are three 20 minute segments and each segment targets a different part of your body: upper, core and lower. So you can do one at a time or all of them if you want a longer routine.20 minutes is good because it's short. But it is intense- Jackie utalizes every second in each routine going from exercise to exercise quickly so you get some cardio in as well as strength training.The other good thing about this dvd is her trainers show you different variations of all the moves so whether you are a beginner or more advanced you can do each move on your own level.I do this with Jillian Michael's 30 day shred and the results I'm getting with them is amazing. The main thing with exercise and being successful is you have to stay consistent and don't expect miracle results. Results will come if you continue, don't even give up and be patient. If you do an exercise routine and only give 50%, you will only get 50% results. You get what you put in."
2,So-so but there are better DVD's.,"I like the show on Bravo and I like Jackie's no BS attitude when it comes to working out but the workouts on the DVD are just OK. The workout as a whole is confusing and there isn't a lot of fluidity between each exercise. The two trainers in the front doing modified (tough and beginners) were great to watch and helpful. The other two trainers (Rebecca and Agostina) were terrible and like watching 2 dead fish. Jackie was motivating but with 2 non-expressive, boring to watch trainers behind her it made it difficult to stay motivated.The Biggest Loser DVD's are better workouts with better trainers and better people on the DVD's."
2,"Incredibly boring, but effective workout","If you can withstand the exceptionally boring presentation and unmotivating banter, then you will get a good workout. The setup is good, where you can choose whether you want to do upper body, lower body or your abs. But that's just the menu. Jackie is sarcastic and not amusing. Her motivation is limited to ""you can do anything for a minute"" and the guidance on perfect form is minimal in the workout portions. Even her trainers seem like they don't want to be there, so why would I want to do this workout ever again?I used this dvd a few times simply because it was a quick and effective workout, but the mind-numbing aspects have moved it to the bottom of my workout list."
5,Workout is amazing!,I really liked the upper body segment. Jackie and one other trainter (they took turns) would do the moves and focus on detail. It helped it go by superfast!Then the Abs segment was different. Everyone did it all together. It was a really good workout! I'm pretty sure I couldn't do all three segments in onw day. I started the lower body and my legs were burning so much I had to stop!
4,Great all around workout!,"After seeing this workout video on OnDemand while on vacation, I bought it as soon as I got home. It is a great all around workout with three different sections (upper body, lower body, and core). You can choose to do all workouts or one, or a combination. I liked that they had options to either minimize a specific move or to ramp it. The routines were very easy to undersatnd and do, and I was definitely feeling it after each one! I use to do my weights at the gym after my cardio workout, but now am doing this on my one hour lunch! Definitely recommened!"
3,It was okay,"I expected something different from this exercise video. It wasn't really all that challenging. I am fairly fit, and felt that I knew the techniques she pointed out, but I know this would be important for novices. I really was looking for something with a little more cardio and more challenging."
5,Fantastic Workout,What a great home workout. It didn't need much space and required only some dumbells. This workout is fast paced and hard. I was already fit but was sore the next day after this DVD. There were some nice twists on some traditional exercises too. She didn't talk too much or too little and gave the perfect amount of intruction and motivation. Highly recommended.
3,just okay,"I bought this on recommendations from other reviewers, but I can't say I agree with the positive ones. There is a lot of ""L.A"" in this dvd, which I find a bit silly. There is much focus on appearance and hairstyles, and not so much on making the workouts interesting or especially challenging- with the exception of the ab section. The dvd is broken into 3, 20 minute sections which focus on different body parts. I would rather have a workout that combines them into one. Perhaps I didn't research it well enough. Totally bought into the hype. Sending this one to the Salvo."
3,Fairly Good Workout,I thought this was a fairly good workout DVD. Jackie and her team are definitely engaging and personable but the workout was too fast paced using too little weight to really help anyone do anything but get their heart rate up.
2,Work out with the Playboy Bunnies,"I have 3 of Jackie's newer workout dvd's and really like them, so I decided to order her first one. I couldn't stomach the outfits-it's like working out with the Playboy Bunny club."
5,The BEST workout dvd,"I absolutely LOVE this workout dvd. As a stay at home mom and army wife, I don't get to go to the gym as often as I'd like to. This is the most effective workout I have ever done. I can't speak for everyone, however, I noticed ACTUAL results in about 2 weeks, for example I toned up fast and had more energy! I did 20 min a day and alternated between core, lower body, and upper body. I recommend getting a good set of hand weights for this dvd. The best thing about this dvd, she uses weight training and cardo, and there are different levels of each movement, and for each targeted area you work every muscle group. Its the best!!! I HIGHLY recommend this dvd if you want to GET WORKED!!! I also highly recomend her clothing line!!"
2,"Used it once, never again","I have a circuit training DVD from Jackie and really enjoyed it. This DVD, however, is a joke. The set and the exercisers' outfits are ridiculous; very cheap looking. The workout itself isn't terrible but it's really not special or enjoyable either. I only did this workout once and will probably never do it again."
2,Good enough...,"I have enjoyed and appreciated the workout DVD. The excercise programs are good and they can be modified to fit one's fitness level. The only problem I have with the DVD is the instructor, Jackie. I don't like to say it, but she comes across as a very annoying person/personality. I know that is kind of petty, so overall I would say that the DVD is a good addition to a person's fitness routine."
2,Wasn't what I hoped for,I got the workout and must say that I was pretty disappointed. I was hoping for variations to make the workouts adaptable to your fitness level - ok for beginner or intermediate - not for advanced.
2,THIS IS WHAT I EXPECTED ANOTHER JACKIE PUT ON,"THIS IS SUCH A LOSEY DVD. EVERYONE HAS MORE MAKE UP ON THEN I HAVE EVER SEEN EVEN THERE BODIES HAVE MAKE UP ON. THIS IS ANOTHER GIMMICK, REASON I STOPPED WATCHING THE SHOW ON BRAVO. JACKIE IS SOMETHING SHE THINKS SHE IS AND SHE IS FAR FROM IT. GIRLS MAY ENJOY THIS BUT NOT FOR GUYS"
4,Good Workout,I liked this workout. It is not my favorite but I am happy with it. I like the added short cardio segments vs. the other workout by Jackie (Power Circuit Training). I also like the format with the feature of working with one person. It really helps to focus on the form and doing to moves correctly. I am finding that I do use this DVD often but it has not replaced my favorites.
2,"Good exercises, strange energy level.","I like the actual exercise, but this isn't my favorite video. The energy is low and each trainer does one section while the others sit in the background and watch, which is much less than inspiring. I do like the combination of weights and cardio, though."
2,Jackie Warner's Fast Pased Workout,"I bought this because I love Jackie and the gang from Sky Sport and Spa. Her workout tape sucks though. She moves too fast from one exercise to the other. She doesn't explain things that well. I understand this is her first video, but I can't keep up. I hope she makes another one and this time slows it down. She is very interesting to watch. I love her show and hope that it returns to Bravo soon."
2,Disappointed!,"I loved this show and I work out often; average workout gal. Jackie moved so quickly I couldnt keep up with the changing moves. She would just ""annouce"" the next move and by that time the ""deminstrator"" was already 3 or 4 sets in WITH NO EXPLAINATION ABOUT FORM or structure. It takes a viewer a few mins to look at the TV, listen, get their weights, and into place. By that time I have missed most of the routine. I wish I could get my money back on this DVD. On a positive note (there are some good workouts on this DVD (if you move quick enough). Disappointed...."
5,The best!!!!,"I love this workout DVD. You will feel the burn the next day. Jackie and her instructors keep you motivated. Even though it is only 20 minutes per workout, it time efficient to give your body a good workout. I highly reccomend this DVD. I hope Jackie comes out with more DVDs!!!!"
5,Whoa what a workout!,"There are 3 different routines on this dvd, abs, lower, and upper body. For the upper body workout you do need some light weight dumbells, but other than that you don't need anything else to do the workouts. These workouts are intense, especially the lower body and ab ones, I was definately sore the next day after doing the workouts! Jackie doesn't really give you a whole lot of tips on how to do the exercises but it's easy to follow."
3,Necessary but not sufficient.,"Hammel's ""Munda Trail"" attempts to fill a gap in the historical literature concerning the central and northern Solomons campaigns. It is thoroughly researched and contains the official U.S. Army maps and a fine set of photographs. The writing starts off brisk and interesting, but grinds to a halt as the troops approach Munda Field (much like in real life). The multitude of small-unit actions would be engrossing with more detailed maps and clearer reference to context. As it was, I found myself losing sight of the forest for the trees. A highlight of the book is the author's characterizations of the various personalities involved. However, I would have liked to see the backgrounds and personalities of the foot soldiers better represented. The New Georgia campaign certainly deserves more thorough coverage. Hammel's book is just a start."
3,"An epic struggle, blandly retold","Nothing against the brave American soldiers who fought and died in the New Georgia campaign against Japan. Theirs was an epic and costly struggle that was a vital step in America's ultimate victory in the Pacific theater. Unfortunately, ""Munda Trail,"" while an excellent historical document of what transpired, is a fairly dry read. Author Eric Hammel just doesn't bring the battlefield to life in the manner of a Stephen Ambrose or a Cornelius Ryan. This book is fine as a work of history, but nor such a great casual read."
2,No Comparasion with his other works,"I have read all other books by Eric Hammel except Bloody Tarawa and this book ""Munda Trail"" does not even begin to compare with his other thrilling works. I really did not get into this book until page 90 out of 233. And even after that the most interesting parts were sparadioc at best. I finished a library edition and learned several new history items I was not aware of, but it is not one that I will purchase at a later date."
3,"""how'm i supposed to feel about that? see, that's what i don't know.""","underpinning this whole exercise are synth washes. the basic track is dull new age pap. over that is what sounds like openings and endings to about a hundred songs, like he went through his catalog and snipped off the intros and outros to all his tracks and stuck them over the synth washes, one after the other. they were clearly good songs, and, extrapolating, one can sense the greatness of all the missing tracks.that is, in part, why this release gets only 3 stars. i want to like it, i really do, but i constantly have this sense that it's constantly starting and ending, opening and closing, without ever being anything. anima is eight hours of music condensed to one by cutting out the songs. the box set that could be would astound even the most determined hater. alas, no such thing exists."
1,wake me when it's over,this is the most pompously esoteric snooze-fest i've ever had the displeasure of falling asleep to. do not waste your hard earned money on this. be afraid. be very afraid.
3,texace on the Boogie Kings - Nine Lives,"This is the Boogie Kings after they got fat and Clint West dropped out and they went on tour all the way to Vegas. Used to rock and sweat to this group at the Bamboo Hut on Galveston Beach. Some of the best Blue-eyed soul from the late 50's and early 60's. Check out Clint West, the Swamp Legend for some great late 50's Southwest Louisiana gumbo and belly-rubbing music, the original Boogie Kings."
1,Light and Fluffy,"There's nothing new under the sun. Whether or not the authors are experts in their fields, this book is not to their credit. The book presents 150 more or less randomly assembled topics presented alphabetically and with very little depth or helpful reference. What I expected was perhaps an outline of investigative techniques or helpful hints. Instead, the authors dish out scant advice and a blend of rehashed, superficial material. This book would be unhelpful and remedial for a novice LEO fresh out of the academy or even to the very green PI. Interesting perhaps as a light and fluffy reference for the lay public. Another so called indispensable book returned to Amazon."
3,Kinda fun,"Not as long or as colorful as I thought they'd be, won't stick to everything, but still fun and you just have to twist the ends together to make them longer. Very portable. Not sorry I bought them."
4,Wikki Stix,I bought Wikki Stix for myself to help me learn Spanish by sticking flash cards on named surfaces with the Wikki Stix. They adhere to most dry surfaces without leaving any residue and stay there until removed.
3,I just expected more,"I have always been a fan of her. I have got her books and some of her dvds at home. Then I got pregnant and I also bought the one dealing with pregnancy but this next one... I just expected more. I don't have the feeling that I am doing Kundalini, but just having a good time.If you want to enjoy yourself a bit with your baby and you are not fit enough yet, then buy it but if you want to go beyond, to feel and work your body and mind a little bit more, use her usual dvds.Nevertheless, she is the best!Sílvia."
2,Beware...,"While this Danco kit says it fits all Gerber Tub and Shower faucets it did not fit the one for which it was ordered.However, in fairness the brand name is not detectable on the shower handle or escutcheons. Though having once worked in the plumbing trade and in the process installing many Gerber shower and tub faucets that's what it appears to be. The splines on the stems however are simply too large in the shower set I was attempting to rehab.Also, if you are planning to keep the parts in reserve (as I was) look over the return policy.I bought this kit for our cabin some time ago. When I attempted to return the goods the time frame had passed a mere 2 days earlier.This made the parts a throwaway for me...."
3,Straightforward reading,"Lately I've been listening to multiple recordings of the preludes again for the umteenth time in as many years. Reading these reviews of Ms. Zayas work, I was salivating to hear her. Well, the pianism is impeccable and tasteful, and she sure does have the chops, but for me, her interpretations are, dare I say, too healthy, too sunny, a little too muscular. This is why I don't care much for Rubinstein's playing. I want more darkness in spots, a bit of morbidezza. If we are on the same page, try Tzimon Barto, who brings something really personal, and in places, exquisitely tender moments; or Argerich, who is, as usual, on fire; or Pogorelich, who, while often over the top and wedded to point making, has some very interesting things to say about the music. For a more mainstream, but also more poetic approach, I like Ivan Moravec. My two cents."
2,OK,"I bought this bag for my son, 1st grader, who is infatuated with Star Wars. After looking at all of the bags, this seemed perfect, however a month after he started using it, the bag began to disintegrate! I found pieced of it all over my car, my house, my son's room...etc. He had to end up using his backpack from the year before."
4,"Tomahawk Revenge (Wilderness, #5)",The book came on time and was in excellent condition. Great story line and as always the author doesn't let you down; there is plenty of suspence along with twists and turns.
5,The Best of Classic 80's Wrestling,"Saturday Night's Main Event was the SHIZZNIT back in the 80's right after ""Superstars of Wrestling"" and ""Wrestlemania"". It's a time capsule that will bring back the excitement of your childhood. The matches from the 90's and 00's are unecessary, but fun as a bonus. All the best wrestlers, clips, interviews, skits, gimmicks, and storylines are included in this awesome 3-disc set. If ever there was a wrestling DVD set to own, THIS IS IT!!!"
4,Impress your retarded friends with your musical taste!,"I recommend sampling ""Your Girl"". a chick on chicks. ""If you want me for your girl,... all you have to do is say,... that you're not the boy for me..."" typical.anyway i liked the stylings. you could probably license it for an underwear add."
2,Not very good,"I like electronica like bent, lemon jelly, ryoskkopp... Bought this to add more, it is really subpar."
5,GREAT CD A MUST HAVE IN YOUR SOUTHERN COLLECTION,"My Dad played sax for Cookie and the cupcakes,Known throughout Southern Louisiana as ""HOT ROD REYNAUD"" I was a little young to remember him in the band and traveling, but after listening to this CD, I was proud! The Quality and sound is all great, and to this day, just like Little Richard, no one in the group get any profits from any sell. Never the less, it is a must have for those of you who like the southern flavor with lot's of spices."
3,How to calibrate the Pelican Cobra TT,"The Playstation 2 version can be calibrated if you read the enclosed instructions!Sentitivity: Press SELECT and LEFT or RIGHT arrow simultaneously to increase or decrease steering ""twitchiness""Dead Zone: Press SELECT and UP or DOWN arrow simultaneously to adjust ""dead zone""Analog gas pedal: Press START and RIGHT arrow and GAS pedal simultaneously (if you don't do this the pedal is binary off/full on)Analog brake pedal: Press START and LEFT arrow and BRAKE pedal simultaneously (if you don't do this the pedal is binary off/full on)Enjoy."
5,Better than the last one I had,"I just bought this today for 35 dollars at hastings entertainment, I recently ordered the Intec Mini PS2 racing wheel which worked forabout 3 minutes before most of the buttons stopped working , this one is much better and does work with Gran Turismo 3, which is why I wanted a racing wheel to begin with. I recommend this one as a good starter wheel. Although I also recommend securing the wheel in someway the front part tends to pop loose from it's suction cups and the pedals should be secured also as they tend to move when accelerating, or braking"
1,Dead Zone too big - no calibration.,"The hardware is nice - foam steering wheel with good feel.Usability - that's another thing. The dead zone in the middle of this wheel is too big to control the car. I played Project Gotham 2 with this and had a very difficult time controlling the car through turns. I switched back to the analog controller and had much better results.As far as I can tell, there is no way to calibrate this wheel. Given that, I would not recommend this wheel.If I missed something, I am interested in how to configure but so far, I don't see anything that gives me an indication that this is a possibility."
4,Fine interpretations which are well recorded.,"Malcolm Arnold wrote a lot of great music for film and concert hall. His entire symphonic output is included in this economical boxed set. While he derived much of his inspiration from Mahler and Shostakovich, he is not quite their equal as a symphonic composer. Brilliant passages alternate with less inspired, and sometimes depressing, passages. The older he got the more pessimistic his music became. At this price, however, you get enough great music to justify adding Arnold to your collection of classical composers."
2,Clips Don't Hold Regardless of Size,"I purchased three sizes, and one review will cover all of them. The clip is not ""deep"" enough and doesn't open wide enough for most bags. They either do not fully close the bag or they don't fit around it. A large bag of chips once opened and folded shut isn't even held in place by the largest clip which just slips off.Forget about the magnets. They just get in the way unless, instead of keeping a bag closed, you want to leave a message on the fridge.My advice is to buy a clip that is more like clothes pin with a strong steel spring. Don't let looks fool you. I've got better ugly bag clips."
2,A portrait of an upper class family with difficulties,"I thought this film was going to focus on the autistic son's life and struggles. However, it did not. This was a portrait of the family from the producer's point of view. It was more about the struggle of having a father who had short temper and who was idolized at the same time. It touches on the life of the son with autism but is not the focus of the film. Whilst the producer mentions that he did not really admit to the anger and flaws of his father as a young man, however, he did not investigate how his earlier denial may have affected those around him. The movie is strictly from his point of view. This shows a life of priveledge in South Hampton and New York City, despite his father losing the family fortune in the 1970's. One can't help but think that part of the story is left untold and question the motives of the producer. Why is he making this film?"
5,Unbelievably poignant,A heart gripping slab of reality that ennobles all of us who have long given up on some ultimate meaning for human existence. Recommend this documentary to everybody.
5,Wonderful documentary about a wonderful human being,"This wonderful and moving documentary deals with the family background and show snippets of the life of an autistic individual who is remarkable for his child-like enthusiasm, honesty, lack of guile, talent, and goodness of heart. His optimism is infectious, and his broad, un-selfconscious grin is a joy to behold. I watched this film twice on Netflix, and was moved to tears several times on both occasions. The brother narrates the movie with precision, affection and a lack of condescension that is remarkable and unique for this kind of material. This film is a must-see, if only to witness first-hand what an amazing human being the main character is."
5,This is a great sourcebook for the classroom,I bought this book to replace a tattered copy I have been using for years. I assign one lesson a week in my directed studies class and supplement the lesson with a slates exercise and a spelling/vocabulary test based on the lesson. This is an excellent tool to use in a middle school or high school English class.Bert Young
5,Fast And Accurate,the delivery was fast and great I recieved my item before the time expected thanks
1,Expected better from Kensington,"Firstly, this product would have been awesome – if it worked! Great size, form factor, appearance. Nasty smell though, not sure why (rubbery/electrical smell, not burning).It's got an AC 120v outlet and a low power DC USB port. The 120v AC outlet, the meat and potatoes of this little number, works beautifully. It's the reason I bought it in the first place, the USB port was an added bonus. Unfortunately the USB was dead on arrival. Tried multiple cars, multiple USB powered chargers, etc. There's no reason why a company like Kensington should have such brutally obvious and testable defects in any of their products – but this is clearly an OEM product from China that they stuck their name on. There's not even a mention of USB in the product manual.If the USB did work, this would have gotten a 4/5 from me, 5/5 if there was no smell (it's really bad!)."
4,Strong album!,"Si no conoces a esta agrupacion que es fiel exponente del merengue del bueno seria buena idea comprar cualquier disco de Azucarado. Este grupo dominicano lanzo su primer disco en 1995 titulado ""Endulzate con Azucarado"" que fue un exito y desde aquel entonces sigue produciendo merengues ritmicos y pegajosos. Este disco es uno de sus mejores creo porque demuestra sus habilidades para diversificar su estilo de crear el merengue. Hay un numero igual de merengues rapidos y bailables que merengues suaves y ritmicos. Lo que hace que sus merengues se destaquen es el fuerte sonido de los tambores y la creatividad musical de los musicos. A diferencia de otros merengueros las canciones no suenan iguales. Recomiendo que compres este disco y espero que lo disfrutes."
5,Amazing Brain,"I'm amazed at the human brain and the defense mechanisms that kick in and take the person on auto-pilot through a traumatic situation. This book is a heart-rending collection of insightful letters from adult Zandra to her inner child. Zandra's touching letters to herself sparked repressed feelings and memories long buried. Adult Zandra was not conscious of the part of her named ""stupid"" until Little Zandra felt safe enough to reveal her secret. When asked why she named her ""Stupid,"" Little Zandra replied, ""She's not smart enough to stop what's happening."" What Little Zandra didn't know was that ""Stupid"" was just as smart and creative--she dissociated herself from the pain and found her own way to escape the nightmare. It sounds like there were several inner children here??"
5,Intriguing !!,"Chapters 17 & 19 were especially intriguing. The first is the transcript of the therapy session in which Little Zandra revealed ""stupid"" - the make-believe person. Little Zandra gave her that name, but later renamed her and thanked her for ""saving my life"" and ""letting me be the smart one.""Chapter 19 records the therapist's conversation with ""stupid."" She was asked why she was keeping the secret. ""Because that's my job"" and to forget and to feel confused and stupid - so the secret would remain hidden. This is how Little Zandra managed to function in a nightmare she could not escape. Thank you, Zandra, for sharing."
4,Excellent look into the healing process of a survivor.,"The journal entries that comprise the bulk of this work will touch any survivor as well as any non-survivor. The only concern I have is the negativity of the title. Quite frankly, if I had not been asked to critique this book for SAFAR, I would have walked right past that title, believing the book to be a nasty slap to survivors. I hope that the author will change the name of the book before its next printing."
2,it could have been a contender?,"Good news; the book has a ton full color pictures.Bad news; NO organization. seems like someone decided to throw a bunch of photos together. the least they could do is put in chronological order, but that didn't happen. how about captions to tell readers what each photo is?Overall; If you like staring at photos, then go ahead. If you like picture books with CONTENT, then look for something else."
1,"Boring book, threw it away.","Don't waste your time on this one. I bought this years ago, and it was garbage. I ended up throwing it away. Definitly NOTHING cutting edge."
2,Disappointing,"The content is random and haphazard, mixing artist photos and decades together. Little to no photos of most early 80's artists that were a staple of early MTV video rotation (particularly new wave music). 60% of the photos are of poor quality - either very grainy or bad color reproductions lifted from TV broadcasts.The book begins with a few interview soundbites from the 1999 VMA, then more grainy photos, then jump to the year 1981 - then to the 1991 VMA and then to the 1986 VMA and continues in this pattern. Very schizophrenic arrangement with no photo captions. Reminds me of a high school yearbook gone bad."
5,Outstanding,I couldn't be happier with this. I've been through some pretty fine dust out here in AZ and it works like a champ.
4,"There's only one chapter about cyberspace, kids.","I definitely expected something different, but was not entirely disappointed with this book. Basically, Spender spends 95% of this book making sure the reader knows that women have seldom been dealt a fair hand when it comes to technological advances that involve the spread of information. A good introduction for people who've been living in a cave for thousands of years. She basically uses a brief chapter on the implications of cyberspace for women - how it is paramount that they be taught to use computers, etc., if they are to survive in the world of men - to bring her argument full-circle. A good read, but I expected more cyber-goodness."
1,Agreed. No PAL.,"The other review is correct. If you go to the Pioneer website they do not have it listed as a model they sell. They did, however, sell a model called the DV-393S, which looks amazingly similar. I bought this in Japan and it does a fair job of viewing multi-region, but not multi-format."
5,Beautiful Operatic cd,"This cd is so beautiful and classical. The singing is magnificant and amazining. I love opera...it's so passionate and sensual.""O mio Babbino caro"" - is my favouite. It is wrenching and lovely at the same time. Well roth the $$$."
1,One of the Worst,"This was simply one of the worst books on WW1 aviation or Von Richthofen I have ever read. Chock full of inaccuracies, inuendo and misinformation. Why the publisher put it out I'll never know."
3,Bickers' Book,"This book is a rather brutal and anti-Richthofen account by a WWII British Airfighter, comparing Richthofen to other aces, generally not in his (Richthofen's) favor, trying to pick him apart at every angle. Very Comprehensive, but..."
1,You call this a tribute?,"And I thought The Wall 2000 was bad. I may be a narrow minded PF fan, but I also dig electronica. /Good/ electronica. I've heard MIDI files of Dark Side classics that sound better than this. And on that note, this album sounds suspiciously (almost exactly) like certain Pink Floyd MIDIs I've downloaded. Particularly the butcherd renditions of Brain Damage (with odd tempo changes that make me wanna scream) and Money.What's best about the original is that it can inspire an emotional response. All the passion and intensity is missing. The acoustic landscapes painted by Pink Floyd are totally lacking, and I don't know that most people in their late teens and early twenties (as that seems to be the target audience) will either understand this or want to listen to it again.Out of Phase, don't complain when you rework what some, including myself, would call a masterpiece and a few folks don't like it. OK?"
4,Depends on what you expect...,"No one in their right mind would consider this to be a great re-make or cover of the original album by Pink Floyd, but then again, I don't think it's supposed to be. As the cover says, it's a tribute. As such, Out of Phase took the original lyrics and music and played them according to their own vision of how the music should sound. Although this often doesn't jive very well with the Floyd original, it is musically interesting most of the time. Some of their musical alterations work well, others don't. As a whole, though, it isn't half bad. I haven't heard the Wall tribute yet, but they also recently did one to ""Animals"", which I also have. It's worthwhile if you're a Floyd fan who can actually stand electronic-flavored music. One has to wonder, though, if they plan on trying to tackle ""Wish You Were Here""."
1,not quite there,"Pink Floyd is a hard band to cover, but I have seen it done. Not here though. These guys did alright for a while, but when they hit ""Any Colour You Like"", they really bombed. It sounds more like a gang of monkeys attacking a keyboard. In short, this is blasphemy to probably the greatest album of all time and you should really keep your distance."
1,Bad cover.,"I will give them credit. Pink Floyd is a hard band to cover. However they didn't even try to do the songs justice. For Example, Money sound awful, what did he do to his voice?! the only song that's halfway decent is eclipse. This is as bad/worse than Snoop Dog's Riders on the storm! I can't state my hatred of this any more"
2,blah blah blah,"Blah Blah Blah, youve heard one youve heard them all. I liked there take on the Wall but one cover album is enough. Its time to take on something original."
4,Give Love on Christmas Day,"Originally released October 15, 1970 this cd still sounds fresh and alive. The brothers' bantering (though forced and stiff) before a few of the songs and playfullness throughout give a sense of family and togetherness that I love. Sure they aren't always in top singing form, but I forgive them 'cause I love them so much. Also the high energy and delight they have singing songs like ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Calus"" and ""santa Claus is Coming to Town"" is infectious and washes away any blemishes. ""Give Love on Christmas Day"" is perhaps one of my all-time favorite Christmas songs as it perfectly sums up the what the holiday is all about - love.For true J5 (or Michael) fans or those who want a fun, energitic family themed Christmas cd, you can't go wrong with the Jackson 5 Christmas Album."
4,CLASSIC CHRISTMAS MUSIC FROM THE FIRST FAMILY OF SOUL,"i loved the J5 as a kid & i still love this. i just bought it this year because i haven't heard it since i was probably in grade school. like David Allan Grier says, you can't go freestyling the holidays, it's a family affair...well, it doesn't get any more family than the Jacksons. the vibe is there regardless of their family history, so reviewer ""willows340"" doesn't know what they're talkin' about. enjoy some real holiday soul with the Jacksons!"
3,A rather badly organized collection of interviews and art,"KING FOR A DECADE is a combination of the art of Jean-Michael Basquiat together with interviews with people close to him, compiled by Taka Kawachi. Among those interviewed are colleagues in the noise band Gray, the musician and actor John Lurie, the writer and columnist Glenn O'Brien, and the gallery owners Mary Boone and Bruno Bischofberger. Some of the art highlights include the design for a record, and his ""Odalisque"". As an appendix Kawachi's essay on the issue of race in Basquiat's works is included.Unfortunately, this is all presented in a manner that cannot claim to be a serious work of reference. There is no table of contents or index, and the page layout is difficult to read. The publishers apparently wanted the work to be a work of art in its own right. Still, there is art by Basquiat here, and so fans may wish to check it out."
4,Morality vs Darwin,"This book should be read along with a few others so as to validate the authors beliefs. I would read James Perloff's ""The Case Against Darwin"" and a short pro-Darwin book just to see what the author in this book is focusing on. This book is definately a good source for the individual who is exploring the anti-Christian (especially Catholic) sentiment which exists in laboratory's and classrooms throughout our country."
2,disappointing,"The film is overhyped. The actual relieving of the siege was one of the most extraordinary special forces actions ever, yet the film fails to put this across in an effective way. Too many talking heads talking about the wrong things (feelings rather than operational detail) and a noteable lack of the promised unique footage.I practically fell asleep while watching it although I did see it right through in the hope of something special that never actually came.Not worth buying - if interested, there's probably a book on the subject."
5,Fritz Keeisler Plays Kreisler,I love this cd. I bought the record years ago and wished that I could get it on cd. If you like violin music you will likely really enjoy this recording. It is just as I remembered hearing it.
3,Not worth the price,"I used cheap water bottles forever until I splurged on this. The light was useful for hiking/camping. However, the bottle always smelled no matter what I did (soaked in boiling water, soaked in bleach...). The strap connecting the lid to the bottle broke after two weeks. In general it was very heavy and hard to bring anywhere, I could not fit it into my backpack or my car cupholder."
2,Great music; Poor quality DVD,"It,s too bad that those responsible for creating this DVD used the same standards set to produce a poor quality VHS tape. The video is unacceptable and the audio is almost as bad. The only redeeming thing about the DVD is Heart."
3,Boring..too many of the SAME songs as Other Dvds,"I am sorry,. HEART keeps releasing DVD's of basically the SAME set list over and over....it is really annoying.How many versions of BARRACUDA do we need? I beleive this is the 7th or 8th on official DVD. Heart almost never delves deep into their catalog for rare tracks. It is tyhe same songs over and over. Hell, they don't even play some of their biggest hits, such as IF LOOKS COULD KILL, a mega-hit. Why don't they ever put it on aa DVD? They never play any of their cool rare ballads such as JOHNNY MOON or AMERICA. SO many great songs..so many SAME songs. YES, this time there are a Few interesting song choices but they are still mixed in withoo many pf the same old. Girls...scrap the set list. We've all heard Straight On, magic man, and ALone 1000x."
5,HEART is awesome as ever!!,"A terrific concert blu-ray! Great song selection and video and the tunes from their new album are wonderful (I only wish the vocals were a little louder with respect to the instruments - even adjusting my speaker sound options doesn't quite get this where I'd like it to be). I especially loved Safronia's Mark and Hey You from the new material. I do wish Nancy had sung the lead on These Dreams instead of Allison Krause singing the entire thing even though I do like Allison's voice (but it's Nancy's song, you know?). At least we get to hear Nancy singing lead on a couple other songs instead. Ann kicked serious butt on everything her vocal cords touched which was awe-inspiring to see and hear. Overall this blu-ray is a wonderful addition to any rock collection. Ann & Nancy are awesome as ever!!"
2,Morbid,"This book was very difficult to read and rather depressing. Unless you want to feel bad about yourself, I say skip it."
1,not what's pictured,"I ordered this item for my mother in a nursing home. I expected a bunch of pieces of fudge to be delivered, as shown in the picture. She got two big pieces of fudge that had to be cut up to eaten - something she can't do. I'm on a different coast, so I have no idea what it tastes like. For me a complete waste of money."
4,A well written book for the beginner,"This is a good book for the beginning C++ programmer. The book is well written, well organized. All the source code complies and if you work through all the source code, you'll have a good understanding of C++ after you finish."
3,Moral: Emphasize Nature,"The history of this debate, recent findings, and anecdotes are fantastic. These make up the bulk of the book, and as a parent and teacher I learned a lot. However, his conclusions don't match well with what he is presenting. For example, his central premise explicitly puts nature and nurture on the same footing, but it is the gene that is the star of this book. Nurture is relegated to an ingredient in nature's machinery. This is 1 of his 7 moral lessons we are supposed to derive from the book: ""snobs should emphasize nurture"". He mentions the ostracism those on the nature-side face ...Perhaps the non sequiturs are his way of trying to avoid the same."
4,very good,very good transaction arrived ahead of time.. product was excellent. Very good all up I don't think I have had better.
4,A good read,"Ridley has a unique talent for exposing technical subjects in a consise and entertaining manner, keeping an eye for detail. I highly recommend this book. It is not as fascinating as Ridley's previous book ""Genome"" but still a very good read. The book is riddled with scientific discoveries you would like to share with your friends. Written as a true best seller it keeps the pace and does not suffer from the verbosity of other popular science books (e.g., Pinker). On the downside, it will appear less ""scientific"" than other pop. science books."
2,Overwhelming the general reader,"So the Nature versus Nurture controversy has been brewing for years, so what? So illustrious men have been involved, so what? That this book was written by the same person who wrote ""Genome: The autobiography Of A Species In 23 Chapter"", is incredible.In ""Nature Via Nurture"" the author spends a lot of time sermonizing, knocking down straw men, taking issue with or agreeing with the great men of the past, throwing out names of people supposedly recognized by the cognoscenti, and successfully flying over the heads of the general reader."
5,"same book as ""nature via nurture""","""Buy this book with Nature Via Nurture by Matt Ridley today!"" says the Amazon.com page. THEY ARE THE SAME BOOK. I fell for this and bought this one.The book itself is excellent, but no need to buy it twice!"
5,An excelent book about the influence of enviorment and genes.,"Explained with clarity like only matt ridley can. this book will make you rethink about what shapes the people. It is not nature or nurture, the things are not black or white, but a litle more comlicated and interesting. You will find a lot of answers to fundamental questions about who ew are and how we become the person we are."
2,Confusing...,"Surely the author doesn't expect anyone to understand this? By putting ""via"" between ""nature"" and ""nurture"", the author has broken one of the golden rules of getting people's attention. Surely it must be one or the other? ""Nature versus nurture"" has always been one of the most preferred dichotomous platitudes. It may be considered clever in certain circles to insinuate further levels of complexity over and above the basic ""black or white"" framework we all know and love, but it won't win any popularity contests! Due to my confusion, I give this book 2 stars out of 5."
3,Deception,I am disapointed that this book was retitled from the original book - Nuture Via Nature. We bought both books only to discover they are the same book. Amazon should have made this change in title clear. The book is excellent by the way and should be a must read for anyone interested about this topic.
3,not early The Shins / Flake Music,"Hey, don't want to pass judgement on the record, just wanted to inform people that this is not an early effort by James Mercer's band Flake (which later became Flake Music and now is the Shins) - Album kind of sounds like 80s music meets Nirvana..."
1,"Great, but mostly useless","Ok, let me start by saying this is one good and complete guide, it covered ALL aspects of the game... but the truth is that for this game, you really don't need a strategy guide, I mean, the game's pretty linear, and there aren't any secrets (with the exception of the bloopers which, by the way, are never mention on the guide)and the game itself its too short. Definetely not required to beat the game."
3,Interesante.,La historia no me logró cautivar. Pero de todas formas al estar tan editada para DVD la telenovela se desenvuelve bien. No se cuanto le habrán cortado de la historia original pero si alguien no la ha visto y le llama la atención la puede ver pues está muy bien resumida.
5,Great Video ...just wanted more dics.....,"This video is so good, but it is only a condensed version of the total novella and leaves out so much great drama and important scenes..I cry because the love affair portrayed by these two is so genuine..it is as if they are really in love. The chemistry between them is unbelievable."
5,Very nice,"Very nice scale for the money, it does exactly what it supposed to do. I love that it measures my body fat and water weight. It's accurate and it is pretty sturdy, I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone."
5,This is a very important book.,"I came across this book researching the economic future of my hometown in western North Dakota. There has been a noticeable deterioration in the economy of this region. Grain farmers, ranchers, and related businesses are stuggling. Many people have moved or are thinking about it. Dan Licht's book identifies economic trends and environmental factors which predict historic changes for this region. It should be required reading for community leaders."
3,informative & well-written,"This book discusses the ecology & conservation needs of several threatened & endangered ""keystone"" species of the plains, and a plan to set aside large landscape-scale nature preserves to protect them. Though the author is from the northern plains, he seems well-traveled and informed on conservation issues here in Oklahoma, as well as other states in the region. I found the book very informative, esp. the chapters dealing with federal farm programs. While I disagree with the author on several points, I think the book proves that landscape-scale conservation of the North American Prairies is economically feasible. I would recommend this book to anyone working in the conservation field in the plains states."
3,Same thing as the 'Jackie Blue' album,"These are the same 10 tracks that were released on an album called ""Jackie Blue"" in about 1995. They were remakes by the current band of classic songs from their heyday, and it made for a pretty good album, although nothing that was a big improvement over the originals. The arrangements weren't much different, so the most interesting differences were that John Dillon could be heard singing 'Jackie Blue' instead of Larry Lee and singing 'Country Girl ' instead of Randle Chowning, while Supe Granda sang 'Homemade Wine' instead of Lee. It sounds a lot like hearing the current band live, which is a very good thing to do. Fans will enjoy these, although the best introduction to the band is 'Time Warp,' '13' or the original albums. The 'Jackie Blue' album is still widely available for less than this version costs."
5,Best available plastic recorder!,"Aulos has the best sound quality you can get in a plastic recorder. This is a great recorder for a beginner, and I have bought many of these over the years to give to kids in the kindergarten/elementary school age group to get them started in music. When I was a beginner in kindergarten, I was trained on a crappy plastic recorder, and I got terribly frustrated trying to make it sound good, not realizing that it was the recorder (not me) that was the problem. The Aulos model not only sounds good, but it has an adjustable position for the bottom finger and an adjustable rest for the right thumb, a big help to beginners with little hands. Compared to wood, plastic is a very tough and easy to care for option for a kid, as kids tend to drop them, bite them, and forget to dry them after use. Aulos plastic recorders in other sizes (besides soprano) are also the best you can get without going to much more expensive wood."
4,Enjoyable DVD,"Contains:""Little Amy"" (1962 Failed TV Pilot)""Daddy-O"" (1961 Failed TV Pilot)""The Dennis Day Show"" (Broadcast from early 50's)""Time Out for Ginger"" (Another failed pilot)Enjoyable with decent picture quality, The 3 failed pilots on this DVD give viewers rare insight into TV, with ""Daddy-O"" containing biting satire that would of seemed out of place back then, and ""Little Amy"" being so cute and charming that had it been picked up, it could of least lasted several seasons."
5,Swamp Gold Volume 3.,"A collection of artists and a style known as ""Swamp Pop"". I caution you that you are likely to end up getting some or all of the other seven volumes. This is great music with its roots in south Louisiana."
3,"Decent production.. but,..","The presentation/performance is very good and it looks like the original production would have been spectacular to see live. However, small details like the video transfer quality (occaisional snow and fringe at the limits of the scan) are annoying and not something expected from a blu ray disc. Audio was good, but not spectacular. Surround sound is somewhat lost on this type of production and can actually detract from enjoyment.Performance was worth watching, but maybe not buying..Cheers"
5,Blue Ray Carmen Superior,"This new Blue Ray is superior in picture and sound. By the way, the singers are all excellent also. It is one of the first products I have purchased in Blue Ray and we feel sets quite a standard for the new medium."
1,inadequate instructions,"I haven't tried all the recipes in this book, but I bought it because I was interested in techniques for making fondant and chocolate-covered candy. However the techniques are not well described and simply wrong - for example the method for chocolate tempering leaves out several steps. I only discovered this when I went to another cookbook to find out what I was doing wrong. Now I use this book for ideas, but other methods for technique. This book is not for novices. Very disappointed."
3,Candy Shop,"I bought this book for my daughter for xmas. She wants to be a pastry Chef (thanks to the food network). So far, she has made the carmel corn (absolutely fantastic), the homemade marshmallows (amazing)and carmel (gooey fun).The only down side to this book is that there are NO pictures, NONE. Not demonstrating or showing the final product. We may need to purchase another book that has pictures."
2,The Ultimate Candy Book,"I was very disappointed in this cookbook. It advertises over 700 recipes but is closer to 200 with variations on the original recipes. For example: Peanut Clusters calls for semisweet chocolate in the original recipe and than a variation is to use 1)milk chocolate 2) white chocolate 3) almonds instead of peanuts 4) cashews, etc. Not a new recipe.There were also no pictures at all in the book so if you are making something new, you have no visual aide to know if you are on the right track.I did find a few recipes that were new to me.And what should you expect for under $5.00, you get what you pay for.The Ultimate Candy Book: More than 700 Quick and Easy, Soft and Chewy, Hard and Crunchy Sweets and Treats"
5,Have Tried It,"This is the greatest book. I found it originally in the library and liked it so much i looked for it at amazon and found it for cheap. Love it! Tried the pecan pralines so far, and the hints it gives are really good- like use a high pan or it'll boil over and don't stir too much or it gets crystally. i am planning on trying out a bunch of recipes before Christmas to decide what to make for gifts and for myself! you won't be sorry with this book."
2,Poorly laid out,This book is very poorly laid out very hard to find things to looking for a specific recipe you Will not find it
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,What a disappointment!!! Rice crispy treats? Trail mix? Potato peanut candy? Chickpea candy? Boring and gross! I got more candy recipes out of Betty Crocker than this book. Repetitive recipes with slight variations. Claims to have more and 700 recipes....where?
2,A Disappoint in the Ultimate Series,"I must admit that I am disappointed in this offering from the Ultimate Series. I tried several recipes and none of them were successful. I won't go away from my grandmother's 20 year old hand me down cook book (A present given to me several years ago) again. I would recommend the Ultimate Ice Muffin, Ice Cream, or Chocolate Cookie Book. I have not had a recipe fail out of those books."
1,Worst Roman Novel Ever,"I can't believe this book is currently averaging four stars. Did we read the same book? I've read a lot of Roman historical fiction from the likes of Ernest Gann, Lew Wallace, Robert Graves, Collen McCullogh, and Gore Vidal, and this book doesn't hold a candle to those great works. Sword of Attila does just about everything wrong: simplistic cardboard characters, contrived historically inaccurate sequences, modern attitudes, and even a pre-battle speech straight out of some cheesy Hollywood action-adventure movie. In fact this book reads like Mr. Ford was writing it with a Hollywood screenplay in mind. For the coup-d-grace, the book ended with a totally contrived and unbelievable confrontation with Attila after the Battle of Chalons. Ford is 'quiche-pop' historical fiction, nothing more. If you want a really good Roman read, check out the novels by the people I mentioned above."
4,Sword of attila,If you like history you will like this book.Not the best but by far not the worst . Glad I bought the book
4,Riding with Flavius Aetius,"This book easily carries you into another time and world.The battle of Chalons rightly occupies the centerpiece of the book.It is well done, you feel as if you were right there with the legionaries on a frantic, desperate day. The Huns and Attila are the bad guys here, but they are given due respect as a tough people with their own ethos and honor. I look forward to reading more of his books."
3,A Fun Read,"This book is a historical fiction. I personally don't ever put to much weight into the facts of these books, but I do enjoy the historical settings. The book is a fun light read about the Romans and the Huns. If you don't put too much weight on the ""fact"" and just look at it as a fun story then you should enjoy this book. Personally I will read another of this author's books."
5,Rare Treasure: Mary Anning and her Remarkable Discoveries,"Having loved all of Don Brown's previous work, I was happy to see that this work was highly praised by Pulitzer Prize-winner Natalie Angier in the New York Times Book Review. Rare Treasure was even better than the first books: historically accurate, engaging, and beautifully illustrated. Brown is able to write simply and humanistically about remarkable people, in a way that allows the young reader to relate. He spoke at my daughters' elementary school, and both kids and parents are still talking about his work. Bravo! Don Brown, write more!"
4,Mackie Compact Mixers...,"Mackie Has Another Hit...This Book Focuses On Small Mixers, And Their Configuration...Applicable For The Audio Newcomer, The Church Sound Person, Or Those Just Getting Their Feet Wet...Experienced Sound Engineers Will Need Not Purchase, After All, We're Talking Mackie, Not Midas..."
5,Makes the Impossible Possible,I've never understood why the manufacturers of electronic gear published such incomprehensible owners manuals. But thanks to Rudy Trubitt I can now operate my Mackie Board with intelligent results. I would think this book would be good for owners of other manufacturer's mixers as well. It made so much sense to me I bought a second copy and sent it to my brother who also owns a Mackie Board. He really liked it too.
4,Shake it!!,"As a bellydancer, I LOVE this CD. Upbeat, fun vocals. I certainly will be dancing to this music. Its a great combination of belly dancey sharp beats and has an old fashioned beach blanket 60's feel thats fun to dance to."
3,A good childrens resource,I was disappointed because I expected more detailed maps. It seems to be an excellent social studies primer. The large pullout map is nice.
5,An Incredibly Moving Story Of Someone Who Refuses To Quit,"Of the 1,000 books I have read on Success/Motivation/Inspiration this one is the finest. John Foppe is a living example of someone who became a winner in life, when it would have been much easier to be a whiner.His story will inspire you, impact your thinking, and most of all provide you with inspiration to take your life to a whole new level.He's a grateful young man who's overcome so much, and someone I'm proud to know. Whether you are in sales, leadership, a student, or in transition, this book will inspire you to take action.The best part of reading John's book is that you will have an amazing story to share with others. They will be glad you did. I know I am."
5,Great chair,We have had our high chair for a little over a month now. We love it. It was very easy to put together. My 5 year old son and I put it together in 15 minutes. It is very sturdy and easy to clean. My 3 year old daughter loves it. Even my son likes to try to sit in it. The price it excellent. I will be getter another one as soon as my new sons comes home ( he will be 18 months old when he comes home). I like that it doesn't take up too much space at the table. We can pull her right up to the table to eat with the family.
4,What I expected,"The directions were really bad, finally I just put it together by sight. The chair is and works as expected. Delivery as was stated when we purchased."
5,Great!,"This is a great little highchair for my 11 month old son. It scoots right up to the table and he's very happy sitting in it. We find it easier to use than our other, and much larger, highchair. It's made of solid wood and feels like it will last us a very long time."
5,WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT EVERYONE EXPECTED, BUT IT WAS 34.99 WITH SHIPPING. MINE IS VERY STURDY AND PUT TOGETHER WELL. I AM JUST MAD I NEVER GOT ONE WITH MY 1ST CHILD. IT MIGHT NOT BE EDDIE BAUER QUALITY. BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I THINK IT IS WELL WORTH IT. I BABYSIT AND WILL BE GETTING A COUPLE MORE. EVERYONE SIT AT THE TABLE WITH HALF THE CLEAN UP."
1,Poor Quality Product...Pick a different model!,Assembly fine...sturdiness fine. The problem I have is with the quality of the wood used. Ours had several spots of knots and imperfections in the wood that left the surface very rough and unfinished. Considering this is baby product I was expecting something better.
4,Good high chairs,"I purchased 2 high chairs for my 21 month old twin boys. Over all I am pleased with their color and sturdiness. They were easy to put together. They are compact and easy to clean.I was however disappointed that they each had a dent/scratch that is very visible. I did not feel like going through the hassle of returning them because I really wanted this style of high chairs. (Click on ""view and share images"" above to see the photos I added)"
3,Item was defective,"The chair came in a nice thin package and the wood seems good quality. It took more time than expected, but I could assemble it in the end. The chair looks very nice, and it would go nice with any kitchen furniture set.The screw holes in the wood are strengthened with metal nests, which is a good idea to make the joints more secure. Unfortunately, one of the metal nests was turning freely in the one that I got. Maybe it is the wood, maybe they couldn't install the piece correctly into the wood. I will give them the benefit of doubt and return the chair for replacement. I am not sure if the piece will get loose after some usage. Then it would be a safety issue with this product. I will keep an eye on the replacement even if it comes without problems."
2,Color way off!,Everything was as described except the color. The walnut color is far darker than shown. Huge disappointment as it looks ridiculous with our dinning set. It will be going back.
2,Damaged goods delivered,UPS delivered a badly damaged box that contained the two chairs I ordered through Amazon. The box was not packed properly and the UPS delivery person had trouble carrying the unbalanced packing box. The box was not only damaged but also the two strapped boxes it contained were also floating around in the larger box. I opened one of the strapped boxes to find a product that was cracked and badly damaged. I could do nothing but return the product which is a tremendous pain. I returned both chairs for a refund.
1,Multiple defective units!,"Obviously this has not always been the case by the reviews I'm reading, but the current shipments of these high chairs are arriving with the belts stuck to the seat of the chair (the belts were attached and allowed to stick to the lacquer as it dried in manufacture). The quality control on this product is horrendous to have allowed so many units to be affected, but then again, this item is made in China (despite being made of eco-friendly Rubberwood, which is the reason we chose it). Sadly, there is no way for them to send us an unaffected unit at this time, we are really unhappy about this product situation."
2,Didn't like it...,"First, we bought it and it was cracked on all four sides. So they sent us a new one and it is still cracked! Right now its not worth the effort of sending it back and forth, works out okay because it is for my parents house, so he is not there all the time. Would not recommend it to others"
4,"Color is way off, but it's a good chair","The color on the listing is totally off. I bought it thinking it was a lighter color of wood and it's not. These are VERY dark colored wood. Buyer beware!But the chair itself is really sturdy and high quality. I would buy again, but would be more careful about the color in the future."
2,craftmanship is poor but it will hold together,"overall it is just OK for its price, the joints are not clean cut, it has some really rough edges, we had to grind down and sand paper it so it leaves a smooth edges. you can feel sprinter when you pass your fingers through it which is not baby friendly at all. And also we got a different color than what was picture, we didnt want to hassle with the return so we kept."
3,poor quality concerning safety belt,The chair itself is sturdy but after one month the plastic buckle broke. It is not repairable and it will be hard to put something else there in its place. Now I feel it is unsafe for my 16 month old.
1,dont waste your time,i ordered two of these for my grandbabies for my Thanksgiving dinner. I recieved one on Monday and when my husband went to put it together we discovered that we had two right sides instead of a right and left side. I received the second one Tuesday and it also has two right sides. No left side. So I will have to send both of them back and go to the store and purchase them. This is the first time I have had trouble with Amazon.
1,poor packaging and poor product quality form Thunder Group,"The first time, the package came with two right-side panels so we asked for a replacement. Amazon did a great job arranging for a pick-up by UPS the next day, and Amazon also immediately re-ordered a replacement which came two days later. I'm very happy with the way Amazon handling everything.Unfortunately, the product itself is not well-made, there are hairline cracks and peeled paint on the high chair. Also, the seat height is only 19 3/4"" which makes it too low to be used with a dining table."
1,Wrong color and damaged -- but nice otherwise!,"Two giant problems with this chair. First, one of the main side pieces had two giant cracks in it. So right there I needed to return it. As a bonus, though, the color was completely different from pictured, but not really enough like any of the other colors pictured to make me confident enough that they just sent the wrong one. I ordered the walnut, but the color that came was more like a golden oak. Not light enough to be natural but not red enough to be mahogany. I'll attach pictures to the review if I can. The wood did seem nice (aside from being cracked and a bit scratched in one place) and for the price it might be worth ordering again to get an uncracked version, but I think I am going to try to find one in person instead."
1,AWFUL!,"I have never been drawn to write reviews before.... until now that is. This high chair is horrible.... and it had nothing to do with how it was put together, but everything to do with how it was made. The belt is in a very awkward position and my daughter can wiggle out of it and then stand up, she's almost fallen several times. Then, when we tried to tighten it, the clasp broke off. So now I'm stuck with a broken high chair. Save your money...... (probably has something to do with being made in China. This is exactly why I try to avoid things made in China!)"
1,wood high chair for children- junk,"these highchairs are not built very good at all, they dont line up. the hardware doesnt hold together, had to drill with screws just to keep together. the straps have broken on all 3. i have had a lot of problems. i would not buy these ever again.i was very disappointed."
4,Perfect for our child,We never liked our standard high chair. Our child did much better in restaurant style high chairs so we purchased this one and he feels more a part of the family since he is right up to the table. Sturdy construction. Only concern is that the seat belt does not always hold him down into chair.
1,high chair - poor materials,"The Thunder Group Mahogany Wooden High Chair arrived with cracks in the wood. We need it for occasional visits from our grandson, so decided against returning it, but the quality of the product is quite poor. We purchased a similar style high chair from a different vendor (Tundra) that was far superior in quality and appearance and also less expensive but with a high shipping charge.The color of the Mahogany chair is as advertised."
3,Good chair for the money,"We bought this chair for our 4-year-old who isn't quite tall enough for regular chairs. Since it was so cheap we weren't expecting much, but it is actually quite sturdy. When putting it together, my husband didn't put the wooden bar in the front, so it is easy for her to get in and out of the chair by herself. Overall a pretty good product."
5,Great High Chair!!!,"Great product!!! It is very sturdy and easy to clean. I was against this kind of high chair at first since I didn't want that ""restaurant"" look, but it was the best one to match our dining room. My daughter is 2 yrs old and her old fisher price space saver was passed down to my son.The only complaint I have is the directions, not very well written at all! It's a good thing that there aren't many parts and I was able to figure it out myself."
2,Hideous scratches out of the box,"I uploaded a picture. Noticed others had similar problems, but I hadn't noticed those pictures before I ordered. Please do check them out. Probably not a problem if you have a sander and wood finish, but then you can probably make your own out of better quality wood (this is gumwood)."
2,poorly made,"this chair is definitely poorly made. the pieces doesn't fit tightly together. the color is nothing like the picture. it is a very dark color. ok for price, but buyers beware of these 2 factors."
2,"Not very pretty, but functional","I really like the functionality of this high chair. It came with all the pieces and was easy to put together--it is sturdy. It is also pretty scratched up and had some decent gauges in the wood. The finish of the seat was rough and low quality. We would have returned it, but we needed it ASAP and were in a jam."
3,Ok for the price,"The chair is sturdy, But it does have a few good scratches on the leg. But the big issue was trying to get the glue from the tape that was right on the wood! Not good packaging. I had to work on it with lemmon oil, and that was after I used scratch remover. It was a gift for my grandson. More work than I anticipated the few days before Christmas."
2,Not as good as restaurant quality chairs,The pre-assembled parts were not well made and didn't fit together well. There were cracks and splits in the wood that could be dangerous. The wood seemed lighter and thinner than ones I've used in most restaurants. I ended up returning this item.
1,Stay away if you need a highchair with decent quality,"I need to buy some highchairs for my church. So I ordered one of this highchair just to see the quality. Luckily I only ordered one. The product is horrible.1. Instead of shipping me 1 foot rest bar (14-11/16"" long) and 2 stretcher bars (16-7/16"" long, the horizontal bar at the bottom) as they should, they shipped three foot rest bars in the package.2. The barrier bar has a 1-1/4"" diameter. However the size of the waist belt loop is way too small for the barrier bar to fit it.As a result of above two issues, I am not able to assemble it.Free shipping is offered. It is made of solid wood, however it only weighs about 12 pounds. I am not sure how long durable it will be even if they ship me correct parts.I guest it is the same ""you get what you paid"" rule."
2,No Bolts!!,Love the color but not sure what they look like assembled. Ordered two and neither one came with bolts or size needed to purchase!
2,WARNING- Wood Color Does NOT match picture,"WARNING! The picture is of a much lighter wood than is actually shipped to you. WALNUT is in the description and that is what you will get. The PICTURE is of am OAK or MAPLE wood. You will NOT receive that color. WALNUT is much, much darker than the wood in the picture. I know - I sent it back!"
1,Dissapointed,I had to return the item because it was defective and the replacement came with missing parts. I was given a mere partial refund but I will think it twice before ordering again through Amazon.
3,ShippingFailed,"I ordered this product along with two other items, one large and one small, that were delivered separately and complete. However, this Wooden High Chair was found to have an undeliverable address, although it was to be shipped to the same address as the other two items. How did this happen?"
2,BEWARE!,"The picture for this product is very deceiving! The ""walnut"" color is actually a very dark cherry color. The chair is good quality, but if you want it to match your dining room furniture like I did, beware!"
1,Not very musical.,"This is supposed to be an acoustic guitar CD, but there is precious little music on it. Each cut may have a note or two, no more. Save your money!"
1,Umm. No.,"Albeit this is an innovative approach to creating sound on an accoustic guitar, it is still painful to listen to and ultimately that's what counts. As a guitarist who's been playing for many years, I can appreciate the technique, but good God man!, my three year-old daughter creates a suspiciously similar sound when I leave my guiter within her reach. Perhaps I should get her an agent."
4,"""More, MORE! I'm still not satisfied!"" - T. Lehrer","""More, MORE! I'm still not satisfied!"" - T. Lehrer. I echo the sentiments. These are all solid, very re-re-readable works. Long may the Dinochrome Brigade endure, and many the tales which will reach us of them. Keith would have approved."
5,Great card,"I bought one of these to replace the standard 32MB card that came with my camera. Wow, now I can store a ton of pictures. The price on the EP Memory cards are awesome too."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"After two or three unsuccessful tries to get this program to load properly, I gave it one more try. It finally loaded, then it would not recognize the USB connection. Gave some kind of communication error with the cable. One more try, and I was finally able to communicate. Went thru the process of picking the files to be transferred and the program came back with a description of which files will transfer and which ones would not.To my surprise, of the 27 programs I wanted to transfer, only 1 was give a ""High"" probability, 2 were given ""Medium"" probability, 4 were given ""Low"" probability, and 20 were given ""Will not transfer"".What a rip-off. Don't waste your money on this junk.If you are upgrading your system to Windows XP, it has it's own file transfer feature built-in. Just go to Start, Program, Accessories, Tools and pick the File Transfer Function.gac"
1,Garbage,"Total waste of money and time. USB cable connector didn't function, software froze up computer. And, support--yeah, right. What a joke. Fortunately, I will be within the 30 day guarantee, we'll see how they are at refunds.Aloha, Bob."
1,pretend i gave it ZERO stars,"ah, you've gotta love a program that takes the liberty of shutting down windows explorer so it can ""run properly"". believe me, do not even CONSIDER spending actual MONEY on this product and DEFILING your system with it. why? no reasons that haven't already been touched upon by other reviewers. it should be illegal to put software this low quality onto the market.die, aloha bob. die."
1,Horrendous,"This product does not work. It crashed both my source and destination computer, at different times of course. It's way too expensive and doesn't do anything for you. After multiple attempts, I've only been able to move 39 files and no applications.Use another product. Any other product. Avoid this one."
2,Not as great as it sounds,"I used this product to transfer files to a new computer I had put together. I used the same operating system, Win98 SE. The program froze up a number of times. I was able to transfer most of my files, some of my applications. The problems is, when it freezes up, it starts all over again rather than being able to see what has already transferred. At one point, with just a few minutes to being finished, it was merging my old registry data with the new and froze up again. Very frustrating! Also, on a previous freeze up, the target computer would not boot fully, even into safe mode. I wound up having to revert to a previous system configuration. I would not recommend this program to the average computer user. You could wind up getting into a situation you may not be able to fix."
1,This Sucks,"Zero stars if that was an option. Nothing on the cover or in the written instructions inside really tells you the true system requirements. You can only get an updated version by downloading, but if you, as I did, can only write to diskette on your old computer and only read CD's or DVD's on your new computer - this product sucks. It doesn't work. Eisenworld's tech support can't return your call the same day. They returned my call about 40 hours later when I wasn't even home. And then when I tried to return the product, they won't take it back unless you get their ""permission"" to return it and a special number. Nowhere is this stated on the cover or the written instructions inside. It simply says ""100% guaranteed,"" return for full refund if dissatisfied for any reason. The return policy on the cover is a big lie. I received the software back in the mail yesterday. Total waste of money!! Use the program included with Windows XP."
1,"Poor product, didn't deliver","I wanted a product that would transfer several large files from a Win 98 desktop to a new notebook w/ XP Home Edition. Had some trouble getting USB hookup to recognize the Source PC. Once that was working, I discovered that this product appears to be worthless for selected file transfer. You get 4 choices with the only file transfer being 1. the entire My Documents folder 2. A bunch of other files. I found that the latter marked many folders for all or partial transfer. I gave up fearing that this puppy would screw up my new notebook with unwanted files. This software is headed for the trash bin."
2,Not all that's promised,"Firstly, let me say that I am an experienced Windows user. I'm no dummy here.I spent 3 hours of interactive time with the product trying to get a move from a Win98 machine to XP. Lem'me tell you, I had to get on line to get a patch even AFTER it had checked itself to make sure that all was up to date. That took an hour to figure out. Then, of all the folders that wouldn't transfer, half of ""My Documents,"" had to be done manually on Zip disks. I didn't want to carry over Netscape (an old version 4) but it wouldn't let me deselect it; I had no choice but to bring it over! To top it off, all of Office is embedded in two subdirectories on my new machine. Not what it's cracked up to be."
3,Good but not enough,"I had to relocate a new PC at home. I choose Relocator Ultra because I consider myself a computer literate and I needed to relocate not only data but a lot of programs (which by the way I had in their original CDs but I wanted to avoid the pain of reinstalling). I did not use the automatic relocation feature because I have seen some reviews that do not favor that option. The results were not good nor bad. All the data and preferences (desk, IE, Mail) relocated OK but the programs only 50% of my programs relocated OK. The other 50% I had to reinstall. Typical problems: mixed or lost data files and folders, registration numbers not relocated (?!) and add-ons (even those on MS Office) not working. If you are a user with only basic applications (oofice, mail, games) this will work fine. If you have many applications, be prepared to install some of them again."
3,Cute craft idea that my 4 year old loved!,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter, who enjoys crafts and thought this would be fun for her to put together. Well, she didn't want to make the pig or the bunny the way it was shown on the box and ended up making them upside down. She had a lot of fun sticking the felt stickers on them, though. When she was done, it ended up being really cute and she was proud of herself for creating a unique pet. I ended up stuffing and sewing it myself, which was hard since it was made upside down and i had to punch out a few extra holes to match up the backing to the front. She brought one of them to daycare for her nap time cuddly for about a week. It feels a bit flimsy and not a very sturdy stuffed toy. The felt material gets dirty quickly.All in all I would say it was okay. I would make sure your child puts it together the right way, or you'll drive yourself crazy sewing it!"
2,Celeb fluff,"If you just stumbled across this, then it's necessary to say this is a one couple French garage band that plays light jangly pop rock, but who famously and recently added Emmanuelle Seigner as lead singer. Yes, the actress and wife of director (and fugitive from justice) Roman Polanski. Can she sing? Kind of, in English, but she's a little off key at times, and sounds like she just came from a diction class. I have no idea what's she doing here, she could just be taking a 40 year old lark, but the overall effect of the CD isn't that bad, it's mostly quite pleasant in fact. Still, it's pretty much unnecessary, and I'm not sure why anyone would buy it."
2,Not at all what I expected!!,"I was expecting a non-fiction tell all about the secrets and rituals of all levels of Freemasonry, but instead received a fictional novel with vague references to the initiation ceremony only."
4,"a good, easy to read summary of dangers in masonry","For those who are curious about the Masons, this is an easy to read, informative book. Most of it is in the form of a novel, based on actual events."
2,"Very entertaining, if you want a good laugh","I have not only read Mr. Deckers books, but spoken with him via email. His entire knowledge of freemasonry comes from his association with 4 or 5 disgruntled former masons. He admits that he has never even been in a lodge. That explains why his books are so erroneous."
1,Decker's opinion,"If you choose to read anything written by Ed Decker, remember that his goal is to slander. Remember that he is very biased and writes only to profess HIS opinion. He is not a reliable man in terms of his authority to speak on such subjects."
2,Read ENORMOUS CRIME by Bill Hendon,"This book seems to ignore the huge body of DOCUMENTATION provided in Bill Hendon's ENORMOUS CRIME. Granted, guys like Bo Gritz haven't helped things, but from DAY ONE, the Vietnamese were clamoring for the reconstruction aid promised by Nixon and Kissinger, with the MIA's and remains of many KIA held in the balance. SKK focuses on the French experience, but doesn't touch at all on the CUBAN experience from the Bay of Pigs, where the Vietnamese learned first hand that the U.S. would pay for POWs.Read both books and decide for yourself who makes the better case.An Enormous Crime: The Definitive Account of American POWs Abandoned in Southeast Asia"
1,CIA AGENT,THIS AUTHOR IS NOTHING BUT A GOVERNMENT CIA AGENT AND THUG WHO DOES NOT WANT THE TRUTH ABOUT POW/MIAS TO COME OUT. THE BOOK IGNORES THE LARGE VOLUME OF EVIDENCE TO MAKE THE CASE MISSING POW/MAIS WERE ABANDONED BY THE CIA AND GOVERNMNET OF AMERICA.
1,Extremely bad !,It's good that this piece of #$%^$ is out of print. Who ever told this lady she knew how to write. She ignores the facts and makes up her own fictional representation and tries to pass it off as the truth. Avoid this one and anything else this non-writer comes up with.
1,Poorly and cheaply made and unstable,"This is one of those product that looks great on paper but is cheaply made and very flimsy. The hub connects, then disconnects repeatedly. It seems either the cable, the connector or the circuit board is loose and I have to turn the thing around, or press on the connector, and hold to it with my hand before it connects.The Compact Disk slot is flimsy and does not always take the card unless you twist and jam it in.The CD that came with it had a completely different driver on it, for a IDE drive enclosure. Strange."
1,SOYO 12 in 1 reader that does not work!!!!,Well after two weeks of trying to get this reader to work I think I'll tank this thing in the garbage. I will never buy a Soyo product again!
1,"This is not Henry Watt's 1941 classic ""Target For Tonight""","This is not a bad DVD, but if you expecting Henry Watt's 1941 classic of the same title or anything remotely as interesting, you will be disappointed."
4,Good but Maybe not Great,"As others have noted, this is not the famous World War II documentary. It does have some valuable footage and has some interesting sidelines on such things as Mosquito bomber raids. It is worthwhile, but still not the needed documentary that RAF Bomber Command deserves."
1,Stolen Title from a Classic Documentary,"TARGET FOR TONIGHT is the title of an ambitious and unusual WWII documentary film about one RAF bomber squadron and featuring one aircraft and crew, ""F for Freddie."" It's a great film, one I saw in film school long ago and wanted to see again. Despite the identical title, this is not the classic film.The producers of this 2004 compilation program used the title of the earlier film and they must have done so knowing that this decision would create confusion. Other reviewers have commented on the title issue. I will add that, despite the title and the illustration on the disk jacket, the production company appears to have recycled WWII archival footage, much of it unrelated to the bomber campaign, and then tried to tie it together with the narration. With a different tile this would perhaps have been a worthwhile production, despite the many similar productions on the same topic."
1,IT NEVER CAME TO MY MAIL BOX,"I am sorry, but this book never arrived... I do not know what really happened. I would really appreciate if you managed to send this valuable book. Best regards."
5,Seagull is a great kitchen water filtration system,"I first bought my Seagull system 20 years ago and replace the filter at least twice a year. While the filter is expensive, it really is worth it. We have water that sometimes tastes terribly chlorinated and the horrible taste is mitigated by this filter. I would not hesitate recommending the system and the filter to anyone. Since I am now way past middle-age, I do have to ask someone to replace the filter for moe since it is rather hard to reach under the kitchen sink."
5,Ouch!,"The man is a bleedin' genius! If you like Ray Davies, Sparks, or Pat Boone, you'll LOVE Martin Gordon! Quirky yet funny lyrics, great melodies, and supreme musicianship! Buy this f*cking CD now!"
5,very good !,"are the best air filters I've seen! I love the performance that gives the car, and security that meets your work in any environment"
1,Messy Cleanup,"I just finished cleaning my filter. All I can say is ""What a Mess!""The cleaning kit costs $10 plus 45 minutes of my time (so far) cleaning and now it is setting on the bench to air dry. How long do I leave it dry? Who knows because K&D; doesn't say how long! Once dried, I have to treat the element with the special K&D; spray.The mess reminds me of the old days of cleaning Oil Bath type air filters.If you like cleaning stuff then this is the filter for you! If you would rather do other more pleasurable things, don't even consider this type element for a street vehicle!Sorry K&N;, you make great products for off road and racing but after the next cleaning when I run out of the cleaning kit components and would have to spend another $10 for a cleaning kit (plus my time), I'm going back to paper elements.For now, I am going to walk to the post office while my element dries for who knows how long!"
5,Works great with new laptop and old Dell keyboard,"My laptop is a Dell XPS17, and my old keyboard is a Dell SK-8110. I like my old keyboard and wanted to use it with my new laptop. I bought this product and it works great. Just plug it in you are done."
5,"Works Perfectly, has lifetime warranty","I use it to plug my old school mouse and keyboard (both of which I love) into my new windows 7 64 bit laptop. I just plugged it in and plugged the mouse and keyboard into it. The mouse and keyboard worked instantly, just like they were part of the laptop- no lagging or typos or anything. In fact, I'm using it right now. What else can I say?"
5,Works as Advertised,"I have a 16-year-young Gateway 2000 Anykey keyboard and was worried I might have to give it up when I built a new machine recently with no legacy PS2 ports.But Belkin came through for me. No issues with with this adapter, and my Anykey will hopefully survive another 16 years!"
5,Does exactly what it shoud,"I tried a similar item by Adesso and found it lagged a lot when I typed. And sometimes the mouse would not respond quite right. I use an old MS natural keyboard and a Logitech Trackman marble mouse. The Belkin adapter connects them perfectly to my Dell Windows 7 desktop computer, and I am so glad I can continue to use them. I want to use them until they die, and now I can, or at least until another generation of computer will no longer accept their input. Thanks, Belkin!"
1,DIsappointed,"We purchased the Belkin USB to PS\2 Adapter so we could use our Kensington Expert Mouse on our new computer (new computer didn't have a PS/2 port). Unfortunately it didn't work out the way we hoped it would, however we can't really blame the adapter. Suspect the problem was with the age of the mouse.We returned the item for a full refund without any problem. Of course we had to pay the postage for the return, so it really wasn't a FULL refund. We have used other Belkin products and would chose them again if the need arises."
4,Prof. Reiss... one cool guy.,"I'm a creative writing student at Miami University, the Ohio school where Reiss teaches composition. I think the other reviews pretty much speak for themselves, so I'm just going to point out that the publisher of this book submitted it for consideration of the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for poetry. And now I'm going to go log into our course scheduling site and try to get into one of his classes."
4,grace in dying,"I FIND THIS BOOK LIKE SOMEONE HOLDING A LANTERN UP ON A NEIGHBORING MOUNTAIN.... SAYING, 3LOOK OVER HERE.2 MS. BRADY OFFERS AN HONEST AND NOBLE PATH TO FOLLOW IN ORDER TO HELP THOSE WE LOVE DIE WITH THEIR SPIRIT INTACT. I LIKE THE QUOTES THAT HIGHLIGHT EVERY CHAPTER WITH A SORT OF WISDOM OF THE SOUL THAT REMINDS US NOT TO GET LOST IN OUR OWN GRIEF BUT RATHER STAY FOCUSED ON THE GIFTS OF LOVE AND CLARITY WE CAN BRING TO OUR DEAR ONES AS THEY FACE THE END OF THEIR LIVES. I NOT ONLY FELT I HAD BEEN GIVEN THE COURAGE TO HANDLE DEATH WITH ANOTHER, BUT ALSO, THE COURAGE TO FACE THE NECESSARY LOSSES THAT I MUST FACE IN EACH STAGE OF MY LIFE."
2,Slow reading. Rambling at times.,"This book was okay. To me it read slow and she rambled. I think there was too much concentration on the background of ""Mommy"" and her childhood, therefore the story gets lost on the author's reminiscing. The plus side, it's the story of the mother/daughter realtionship and how that progresses."
5,Happy with the service,I am happy with the product... the delivery & the details on what I was buying...Price is excellent....I recommend you....
4,"Getting that ""Obama money""","Why work when the government can support you? For those in that frame of mind, NOLO's Guide to Social Security Disability: Getting and Keeping Your Benefits is a worthwhile read. No, it doesn't tell you how to go about faking a disability, or exaggerating a real one to avoid the tedium of having to work for a living, but it is an effective guide for going about making your claim. Of course, some people really are disabled and I do not object to having my tax dollars pay for their support. Above all else, this book is for them."
1,Nolo's Guide to Social Security Disability,"Not at all helpful if you are filling out an application for SSDI benefits. More than 3/4 of the book is on the appeal process and social security system jargon. You can tell it is written by a lawyer, its worthless."
4,A worthy reference guide to Social Security Disability,"When reading the material in this guide I found the information to be accurate and comprehensive. The guide assists you with the process for filing for Social Security Disability benefits and keeping your benefits.Chapters include applying for disability, getting benefits, proving you are disabled, appealing if your claim is denied and your right to representation.There is included a CD-ROM with sections 1-14 of the book. The sections list different disabilities that are explained in detail.I would advise that you read the book, check for updates on the Nolo website, and hire a disability advocate representative or attorney to help when you file a claim. Although the book is great help for navigating the paperwork and red tape that you have to go through, a live person that you can ask questions and be your representative is key."
3,Social Security Disability,Im new to the whole area of Social security and this book gave a good overview of hot to qualify for Social Security disability benefits.Easy to follow!
5,Wished I Had Bought It Earlier,Assisting my sister-in-law who has a severe cardiomyopathy to get Social Security disability. This book was purchased after her rejection and the guidance is great in navigating the reconsideration. It would have been much smarter to buy it before the first application.
2,Older Version,This book was copyrighted several years ago and so I could not rely on the information as up to date. I really didn't see that as being clearly stated on the listing for the book. Otherwise the book was well written and easy to comprehend.
5,Very Informative,Reading up on this material is quite interesting and it does give a lot of knowledgable insight on the SS system and their methods.
5,Great music with a great performance.,I found the glass harmonica music most relaxing with an etherial quality. The performance is outstanding.
3,Highly Unlikely,"So - Beethoven is a performer on this CD? You might want to check that ""fact"" out. Did he come back to life just to record or was there some kind of hitherto unknown recording technology in Beethoven's lifetime?"
4,If You Missed Out...,"This collection is perfect for fans who missed out on the Magnetic Fields Remixes or the Electric Molecular single. The first half of this disc is a straight reissue of the aforementioned EP, followed by East Side Militia-era remixes that were originally released on the EM single or various promotional discs. The compilation ends with the only new track, Static Haze- the ""lost"" suture. Even though about nine tenths of the album is previously released material, this is still a convenient package that's worth your time. The original discs that these tracks came on are long out of print, and Suture also makes for an excellent overview of Chemlab's short career. If you're brand new to Chemlab, start with Burnout at the Hydrogen Bar. Once you've absorbed that album, give this one a shot."
2,REHASHED!,"Ok I really did like East Side Milita great f-king instrumentals and s-it like that but this album's instrumental's, vocal's, and nething else I can think of ... soooo bad. Take my word I did not enjoy this album at all it's all rehashed you hear me rehashed! So do yourself the favor and avoid buying this follow up... it only got 2 stars from me because I like the cover pic."
5,Tony Martin CD,My mother loved it and I got it very quickly. this was a gift so I have not listened to it but my mother was very satisfied
4,Far less costly than Pill Pockets,"I have many senior dogs on medications, so cost per pilling is very important to me. This product is great because it doesn't require refrigeration (unlike cheese or meat wrap options), so I can keep it on the kennel room shelf. The ONLY difference between the Cat and Dog varieties of Chicken flavor is the addition of the essential amino acid Taurine in the Cat format (dogs can ""make"" their own Taurine), so if your cat prefers liver flavor, that would be fine for the tiny proportion of her diet since she's likely getting enough Taurine from her other commercial foods. For my dogs, I buy whichever variety is on sale. The only thing I DON'T like is that it is not shipped by Amazon, and if you only order one cup of it, the separate S&H from Amazon's partner company almost doubles the cost of the product. So, I try to get together with other local pet owners when ordering to share shipping."
4,The easy way to get your dog to take a pill,"We're working on our 3rd container of Flavor-Doh. My dog loves the liver flavor better than the chicken and since she's 13, I'm not going to argue. I need to get her pills into her however I can. This is an easy, cost effective way (compared to Pill Pockets) to get her to think she's getting a treat. I found that the doh does dry out a little by the time you get to the bottom of the container. Otherwise, it's a great product."
3,"Ok, I guess","My 9 year old pit bull is on several medications and we have tried to hide her pills in absolutely EVERYTHING. Our vet recommended we try Flavor-Doh, we'll she sniffed it and that was about it. I guess it works for some dogs but not mine."
1,Gone and forgotten...,"Happened to come across this book at a book clearance for $1.oo and couldn't resist it.It took less than an hour to read it.He had a heavy presence while Speaker;which certainly does not come through in this book;but then again it deals with only part of his first year.It's also disappointing that a photographer with so much access couldn't bring out more of Newt's personality or interaction with others. It's odd that after all this time mine is the first customer review ;but then there's not a lot here to comment on.I don't remember this book being published at the time ;but it probably had the normal amount of hype, oh well, so much for hype."
3,Inspiration to Me!,I thought the book gave good detail on Panic Disorder and how it can affect anybody. The first couple of chapters went on to long about how he grew up and gave no information on his disorder until later in the book. I believe the book should have began when he started to develope Panic Disorder.
5,Beautiful AND Accurate!,"Absolutely gorgeous doll, and it actually LOOKS like Mulan does in the movie. The details on her outfit are lovely, and her overall design is too. The comb actually works as a hair accessory too. I'd rate this 5/5!"
4,Suprisingly Good,"Todd McFarlane's Spawn is much better than i expected it to be. I remember watching this show in bits on HBO back in the 90's. It was hard to get a grasp of what was really going on but to watch it in whole made everything right. A friend lent me this dvd set and I started watching it and could not stop til it was all over, then I purchased it. Its much better than the live action movie and if you never got into the comic series like me it fortunately flows very well from the beginning so you will know what is going on. If you like dark violent things then this is for you. In other words this is Hardcore no kiddy stuff. I must say though..The special features get very annoying. Todd McFarlane sure can talk alot.."
4,i agree,"It's awesome, but like the other guy said, it just ends! And right before all the good stuff!!!"
4,Spawn Ultimate Collection,"Not a review. Ive ordered this series based on seeing and enjoying the HBO presentation. My question is, Why does this DVD have a release date of Aug 21, 2001, when I have seen it in stores and others obviously already own it? Is there something different about this release?"
3,not consistent quality,"Basically the quality of this set is okay. Disc 2 sounds horrible. What did they do to mix it? You can hardly hearSpawn when playing through a 5.1 system. You have to turn it up and then down etc. Also, why aren't all the discs mixed in 5.1? Maybe that's a good thing because at least when it is in 2.0 you can hear what Spawn is saying. Because it is a great show that deserves five stars, I won't give my review less than three stars. But come on, give me the quality this series deserves. At least I could hear on the video tapes(which I sadly gave away because the DVD set was on it's way."
3,hmmm!,Okay condition looked a little beat up i actually got it as a gift for someone he recently got finished watching the entire thing he said it was very dark and sinister different then he expected i guess.
4,"Doin what I want to do, but some say that I be...","TAKIN IT TO THA EXTREEEEEEME. This is what hip hop should be about. Lighthearted lyrics about smoking and drinking, getting with ladies, and straight chillin. This is the first I've heard from Devin since his amazing debut album ""The Dude"" (a must have for hip hop lovers). The beats are extremely crisp, especially the title track. There are some breaks from Devin's usual style, with the laid-back ""Briarpatch,"" and the beautiful slow jamming ""Anythang"" offering the listener a more mellow and thoughtful approach. But the combination of those melodic jams and the funky hard-hitting hip hop beats which traditional fans of Devin will no doubt expect makes this album an X-tremely satisfying hip hop album. Plus many of his lyrics will have you rolling on the floor with laughter, which I think is a great break from all these wannabe-gangster ""I'm too hard to be funny"" rappers on the radio these days."
5,2. best album,"ok i have it now 1day and must say its the best lp after ""Devin-The Dude"" my favorits are: to the xthem,Party(oowweaah) and briar patch, well i love them all, exept ""the funk..."" but what ever. just listn it'upsry for bad english, i try my best *G*"
3,nice after initial break-in period,"These gave me a little knee pain initially, but after a week or two they became the most comfortable shoes I own. I have hiked in soft dirt and walked on wet pavement without any slipping but these are not waterproof."
4,Excellent walking shoes,Excellent made and very comfortable. I wear these shoes all the time. They are more comfortable when I am moving than when I sit. Highly recommend
1,Too bad the CD is unreadable and unreturnable,What else can I say?Maybe the music is good. I'll never know.I have no idea if this is a common problem.
5,Let Polly do the printing and run out and buy this book!,"Why any kid would read that Harry Potter nonsense when great children's literature like this is available is beyond me. Hopefully, Amazon will get more copies of this in time for summer. It makes great beach reading."
2,last of the summer wine,my wife and i have enjoyed all of the programs on each disc. we watch it regularly on pbs and look forward to each cd as they are available
5,Wolverine at his best!,"In this book, Wolverine is confronted by mystical creatures who need his help. As usual, Logan is torn between his feral side, and his logical self. Although this is a reoccering theme, this is still a great read with clean crisp artwork! Get this book."
2,terrible fabric,"Terrible rough fabric-not at all what I expected! very cheaply made = No lining so it is see -through white trouser!!!! I want to return it-but it might cost me.. I am quite disappointed in this purchase- wasted my money,I could get nicer clothes at a local store and return easily if not satisfied.I regret this purchase -the picture so deceiving."
3,Not really what I expected...,"When I saw these pants I thought they would be a bit like Dockers or other khakis style pants. That was not the case. They were not as fitted and the material was thinner then I expected.They did fit fine and look ok so I am wearing them, but I would not purchase them again."
4,Slow but Simple,This software is not top of the line.. therefor isn't promoted as such... or priced as such. I was very pleased with the outcome of it's use. The install was fast and simple (and I was only working with one monitor between two PCs). Transfer time was a bit lengthy but WELL worth the while. I suspect that maybe the other users who had problems were either not very knowledgeable about taking on such a task by themselves... OR they had pre-existing PC problems.I recommend this (for the money).(In quick reference to another review here - nowhere does this product state that it comes with a USB cable for transfer - that comes with the pricier PC transfer software kits - and NO alterations to your PC are necessary).
1,Worst software I've ever used.,"It took 26 hours to do the transfer. First, not everything was transferred. Second, most of what was transferred was damaged and therefore unusable. Had to reformat new computer and start all over. A big waste of money and time. Please avoid this one."
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased this product, never worked at all, I contacted the company to return for credit, took 2 Faxes, 3 Emails and 2 Phone calls and 2 weeks later they email me and tell me it will take 3 more weeks to start paperwork for return. I plan on reporting them to BBB and Atty. General Sate of Florida.Do yourself a favor and don't purchase this product."
1,Goodbye to Aloha Bob,"Nothing but trouble; I would have rated it 0 stars had I the option. Took me over a week of this and that errors listed using the various cables. Finally had to transfer the data by burning a CD which I could not load as I received an error message there, also.I should have read these reviews first."
5,The best software ever,"This is the the greatest pc migrating software that i have ever used in my life, I mean it moved everything over. It was so simply and easy, I recommend that everyone trys it. You will love it."
5,Still Great,"After so many years of playing the role of ""Zatoichi"" Katsu Shintaro still manages to put out a stellar performance is the reluctant hero ""Ichi"". His character has grown much older now but still roams the back roads seeking peace but always running into opposition from both the law and the gangsters (yakuza). In the midst of all this he is still trying to help out the less fortunate. Yes there's is less fight scenes but the theme of good conquering evil against all odds is still there. A must for fans of this series."
4,Amazing.,"This was my first Zatoichi movie and I was amazed, at both the action and the character. While the movie had it's slow moments that action made up for it with ease. No doubt that his prior movies based on the blind swordman will be added to my collection."
4,Fighting to the end...,"This REALLY is all the plots, themes, and sword fights of all the earlier 25 films combined. From the betting on the dice outside the cup to the slicing enemies right through a wall! Everything was used in this film. But that's ok, fans will enjoy it. Also by 1989 the film quality and special effects had advanced alot since the last film in 1973. Think about it...in 1973 I was two years old. In 1989 I was one year from finishing high school and going into college. That IS good piece of time, yet Shintaro Katsu, while not looking that well, did a very respectable job in his performance as Ichi. And the final battle - well, you have to see it."
3,JUST LISEN TO THE REVIEW BELOW ME!!!!!!!!!,* Kevin Robbins is RIGHT!!!!* He is the smartest reviewer I ever seen because he is sooo right!!!!!ADIOS!!P.S: The ONLY fight that was pretty fast is when Zatoichi is facing five men in the woods.ANOTHER THING: No final fight!
4,Informal but influential roles,"Tague writes of a distant time in England, when women had few public roles. How then, centuries later, to tease out what women did to jockey for status? By intensively analysing original documents, Tague claims to have elucidated results. Almost every page is littered with copious footnotes referring to these documents. A tribute to the comprehensive nature of her scholarship.She surveys the ""permitted"" roles of women, in fashion, marriage, household management and ""politeness"". The latter had a more sweeping meaning then than it does now. From these roles, she show hows aristocratic women were able to carve out informal but nonetheless real influence at the highest levels of society."
4,"Great product for still images as it is intended, doesnt work well for video","Just doesn't cut it for panning while taking video with my D300 but I have a fluid filled head that does and the quick releases fit one another so overall, I give it 4 starts. Very well made and fits on my sherpa legs perfectly. For the price, its hard to beat."
4,okay its a phone,These phones are great. the 2.4 gigahertz allows you to make and receive calls without to much interference from your neighbors phones. The only other option that would be nice is for it to have the ability to add other phones to it. Another down fall you can not hang up either receiver on the opposite base or neither will work and you have to reset it by placing the original phone receiver on the base charger and the second receiver on the secondary wait ten seconds then take the second receiver and place it on the base charger. When the led reads it has been reconnected then you can then use it again. Confusing I know but that is one of the draw backs to multiple phone sets. WE marked ours with stickers Other than paying attention to which phone is which these are excellent phones.
1,The phone belongs in the trash,"Am I glad that this phone is no longer sold. The phone has too much static to be able to hear. What is the use of having a phone that one cannot hear?! Others can hear me, but I can hardly hear them. The price of the phone was high, but I paid for it anyway since I wanted a good phone. Boy! What a piece of crap it turned out. Now I am in the process of looking for another phone (not this model). This time I will try it out before I buy it. I recommend that you folks do the same."
3,I would only buy if you are a clarinetist,The recording quality is not very good on this CD. The best recorded work is the Mozart Concerto. This recording is worthwhile to hear Wright play but the quality of the recordings is very uneven throughout the CD. Most are live and the microphones are miles away and there is too much ambient sound. It is a shame that the recordings are not of better quality it does not do Wright's playing justice. I purchased this CD as a clarinetist but cannot recommend it to a non clarinetist because there are so many high quality recordings of the Mozart Concerto where your money is better spent. Sabine Meyer comes to mind of a very well recorded and well played Mozart.
2,A Leisure Let-Down!,"With all the incredible, seldom heard blurb from other authors and reviewers on the cover and inside cover of this book, I was expecting to see writing that I have never seen before. The Death Artist, at best, is average horror fiction...and many of the 12 stories, as far as I am concerned, are not even horror! One tale, dealing with a woman in the porn business, simply does not belong here. I must have missed what all these other authors praised."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This video is a waste of time and money. It's advertised as a First Base workout, but of the 45 minutes, only about five are devoted to first base. Production quality is very cheesy and amateurish, and they waste far too much running time on long transitional graphics between each section. My guess is that there's about 15 minutes of actual content, with 30 minutes of nonsense. There are plenty of better baseball instructional videos out there. Don't bother with this one."
5,a legend,I am looking for this CD for about 4 years. Hard to find CD's.It's include all hits song's of the Pasadenas.I bet you will like it and you will agree that pasadenas is a legend.
5,"A fun compilation of the sights, sounds, smells, and one-of-a-kind experiences present all around the world","Roads Less Traveled: Dispatches from the Ends of the Earth is a collection of travel essays by Catherine Watson, the chief travel columnist and photographer of the Minneapolis ""Star Tribune"" newspaper from 1978 to 2004. Divided into segments that devote a short and sweet 4-10 pages or so to each destination, Roads Less Travels recount highlights of the author's journeys to Spain, India, Mexico City, Vietnam, Australia, Bhutan, Antarctica, Kilimanjaro, and many more exciting and far-off places. A truly eclectic and fun compilation of the sights, sounds, smells, and one-of-a-kind experiences present all around the world."
3,Costs a lot of money.,"Considering that this Ebook lectionary has only the readings for Sundays and Major Feast Days and only covers Year C, it is much too expensive. The paper back ""Abide in My Word"", which has readings for every day of the year, costs about the same for one year."
2,Not a speaker phone,"It has a speaker so you can listen, but no microphone. Despite that I occasionally got feedback when the hand-set was on the loudest setting.On the other hand, the quality seems better that other recently bought phones."
2,"Connick, Jr. Christmas Album","Not as good as I anticipated. I like Connick, hut this album just didn't do it for me. Wouldn't really recommend."
5,very good,I purchased this product with the cap. It is a good product and easy to install. It has a good price and good service.
3,Tchaikovsky Light...,"Just like Beatle fans flocked to whatever they did, so does Tchaikovsky's. I guess I'm one of them! I've enjoyed other Peter Breiner/Takako Nishizaki efforts on Naxos, so I was compelled to purchase this disc. Tchaikovsky in his day composed over 100 little known songs based on poems about all facets of life in general. Skilfully orchestrated by maestro Breiner and solo violin(in place of vocalist)performed by Nishizaki, we get a nice symphonic light 75min. plus program.Sorry, nothing extraordinary here, just nice background music for whatever relaxation. ""None But The Lonely Heart"" based on a Goethe's song for a gypsy waif, one of the better arrangements, has been penned by Beethoven and Schubert among others. If you want to take a break from the over played ballets you will find these arrangements characteristic of Tchaikovsky; just not his greatest hits material. Spacious and warm recording!"
2,don't you think it's time to retire?,"""Takako Nishizaki is one of the most frequently recorded and among the best selling violinists of all time."" That's nice. Please go home. Get some rest. I compare her string tone to scratching on blackboards. Her thin wheedling is a dreadful match for Tchaikovsky's music; perhaps better suited for an oriental concerto such as the Butterfly Lovers, but basically unpleasant for one who enjoys the robust tone of a Keylin, Barton, or Bisengaliev. Peter Breiner does his customary exemplary job of orchestrating. Tis a shame Ms. Nishizaki distracts from it."
3,Here's LUCIE (ugh)..........................................,"Geez, ""hand picked"" by Lucie Jr should have warned me, but even I was shocked to see ""the classic Pepsodent Commercial"" starred HER! Lucy Sr was the star and reason for the show, Cling on Lucie Jr never stops mugging, scene stealing, hamming, nauseating and probably never will. Watch for the genius of Lucille Ball, not her ham bone, attention starved, obnoxious daughter. The shame is that the real talent in the Ball offspring was handsome, casual Desi Jr. Give us Lucy...... give us a break from Lucie - Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeezeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great trip down memory lane,"This forgotten little gem of a show is a pleasure to watch thirty years later. A few observations:1) The aging process was definitely catching up with the ol' redhead, but she still had her timing. And she was still a joy to watch.2) Lucie Arnaz had a great pair of legs...she was a tall, pretty knockout, and developed into a good comedienne as well.3) What can you say about Gale Gordon? Except why isn't HE in the TV Hall of Fame?4) Young Desi wasn't given a lot to do. And that's probably a good thing.5) Since Lucy was one of the richest people in Hollywood, I wish she had spent more on sets. The overall look of the show is kind of cheesy, and that's multiplied tenfold with the clarity of DVD. I guess they spent all that money on guest stars. Some of them were worth it, and others....All in all, it's a good time capsule of Lucy circa 1968-72 or so. America was in turmoil, but all was well in Lucyland. Not a bad place to be."
4,"It's good to have more that just ""I Love Lucy""","Don't get me wrong - I know ""I Love Lucy"" is Lucille Ball's masterpiece but we have been ""I Love Lucy""ed out with TV Land showing it continously. ""The Lucy Show"", her show from the 60's, and ""Here's Lucy"" from the 70's, are ones I remember but would love to see again. They are underrated and would give us and the 21st century viewers something different from ""ILL"" all the time. I applaud this release and hope that whomever has ""The Lucy Show"" rights will see fit to release them as well as more ""Here's Lucy."""
5,Please give us more of Here's Lucy!,"This DVD is excellent! Let's hope that Lucie Arnaz and Desi ArnazJr. release more of the episodes of Here's Lucy! Please! It is truly part of our American Television Heritage. In my opinion, (if it has any weight) we don't always need an episode with a famous guest star as there are plenty of hilarious episodes with just the regular cast memebers (including the fabulous character of Mary Jane!-who pops in and out from time to time).Please give us more, Lucie and Desi! We truly need more of this terrific type of comedy,especially with today's entertainment selections (which are nothing to write home about!)"
3,Good but not as great as the earlier shows.,"I find that the selection of shows is only mildly entertaining. I found I Love Lucy to be classic; it has great stories that will never get too dated. Even in black and white, it still is a fan favorite. I found The Lucy Show to flow smoothly. The shows with Vivian were the best, but all of the shows go quickly and are entertaining. I found only some of the shows on these disks to breeze by. Other shows seemed to be slow paced and miss the energy Lucy had in her other shows. As someone said, other episodes should be on this disk that are truly fan favorites. I would still buy the disk for these episodes: Lucy Meet the Burtons, With Viv as a Friend, Who needs an Enemy?, Lucy and Lawrence Welk, The Matchmaker, and the 2 Jack Benny shows. These shows have classic Lucy routines, warmth and charm. Some of the others have good moments but then drag on. The extras are cool though."
5,buy this DVD today,"This DVD set is really great! The picture quality and sound are excellent. This set contains the best loved episodes from the series. It has bonus features which include commentaries, promos, bloopers (which are very funny!) I would recommend this DVD set for your enjoyment. Please buy it today..."
3,Too much emphasis on guest stars,"I'm a huge fan of Lucy and, especially, the Here's Lucy series. I thought this package was OK, but would have been much better had they chosen the best episodes period, instead of focussing on the episodes that had the famous guest stars appearing in them. I was also disappointed in the syncing of the visual and audio tracks - they were slightly off. The commentary by Lucie and Desi Jr is very interesting, but you actually have to watch the episode by itself first as it's impossible to hear the lines from the show and listen to the commentary at the same time. Perhaps a separate short commentary (rather than one that accompanies the show) would have been a better format."
2,A Disappointment,"No matter what the series, it has always been a disappointment when Lucy hobknobs with and fawns over guest stars. With the exception of the Hollywood episodes, even ""I Love Lucy"" had a few clinkers like these on the ""Here's Lucy"" set.The packaging and quality of this set are great. Care was definitely given on every aspect of production.The was the first-run Lucy program with which I gew up and I certainly remember having a good time watching it. My disappointment only grew as each episode on this set unspooled. Surely there are 24 other episodes in the remaining 120 that would actuallly meet the ""best of"" criteria. I don't know that I will keep this set - earning back some of my money would be better than letting it sit unseen.The ""I Love Lucy"" disks are worth the expense and let's hope ""The Lucy Show"" is released season by season so those of us who wish to can limit ourselves to the ""Viv"" episodes- the ones before that series degraded into a ""Who's Who"" of Hollywood."
3,where's lucy?,"at least the new ""here's lucy"" is not cheap knockoff stuff, so i guess that's good. but why has there never been a quality release of the earliest shows when lucy launched her solo series (with viv vance) in 1962? none of the knockoff dvd's even mentions any of those black-and-white ""lucy show"" episodes from the early '60s--when she was at least still reminiscent of her classic comedic talents circa ""i love lucy."" all we get are the later stuff with mr. mooney and a bunch of superfluous guest stars. anybody got an answer to this?"
5,Long Over Due,I am so excited that Here's Lucy is to be released. The queen of comedy once again shines in this awesome comedy series. I truly hope that more episodes will be released soon. The extras look great. Thank you for bringing Lucy to the public again. We love Lucy she make us laugh for hours. Her show is the tops. I'm glad she is here. Hopefully they will put on DVD Life with Lucy too.
5,Endless laughter!,"Another great addition to my collection, love the episodes with her children, and Mr Mooney. And Vivian Vance in a couple of episodes is always fun! Great buy, great seller!"
1,Very weak translation of a very important book,"Both the introduction and the translation by Hugh Lawson-Tancred are very much below the standard one expects from Penguin. Most importantly, the English of the translation is frequently incomprehensible. I advise everyone who wants to study this masterpiece of a book to use another edition, e.g. that of George Kennedy, published by Oxford in 1991, or the Loeb edition. That is, if you want to understand why so many people in so many ages found this book brilliant!"
3,Too Much,Aristotle proved too much for me in this book. As a person who really has no background in Philosophy this was a tough read. He just seemed to be stating the same points over and over. This is not the book to start with if you are interested in Greek thought.
3,Not the most distinguished in the series,"The 9th and 10th symphonies by the Slovak composer Alexander Moyzes (1906-1984) represent a new direction from the slightly grey late-romanticism of the earlier series, even if it is - in virtue of the slightly choppy style based on melodic cells rather than actual themes and the orchestrations - recognizably by the same composer.The ninth is a dark almost Shostakovichian piece with agitated almost unsettling second movement. This is a rather complicated work and is starkly contrasted to the more straightforwardly structured and lyrical tenth. The music, in both works, is eclectic, yet Moyzes do have a recognizably individual voice nevertheless.Recommended for the adventureous, but you might wish to consider starting your Moyzes survey with one of the earlier issues (the 5th and 6th or 7th and 8th). Performances are more than serviceable, but not very distinct, and the sound is again a little boxy and rough."
4,Great book!,This book is very well written and easy to understand. It gives many examples and is divided into acceptable chapters! Good purchase for counselors who wish to do group counseling.
1,Never got it,"I really wanted to add this item to my collection but, never got it really displeased with not having something I pay for and really wanted."
3,My poster was messed up :L,"It was not in the best conditon, could have been better. looks good on my wall tho, also got here pretty fast"
5,I AINT AFRAID,I named my cat after a ghost buster and my walls are pretty bare. The poster is pretty high quality semi-gloss with a decent stock. If you love bustin ghosts.. buy this.
5,Page Turner!,"This historical drama moves through different countries and involves many dfferent cultures. The poor, wealthy and noble are all represented in this novel. There are many mysteries to figure out and solution is not usuually the one you were hoping for. This is worth your time."
5,A wonderful mystery,Starts off a bit slow.... I could do without the first chapter.Anyways this book is fabulous! I couldn't put it down... I was totally on the edge.. A wonderful mystery and a wonderful edition to Justin's adventures!This book proves that Ms. Penman is like a fine wine... she gets better and better with age! Each book is better than the last.A sheep or a wolf?
3,Prince of Darkness,"All the political maneuvering of the royal court of the 12th century,as John tries to wrangle the crown away from his crusader brother. A person is murdered and the queen calls in her man Justin to skillfully handle her concerns about her son, John and his desires on the crown of England."
2,Not the authentic CD,"This CD is musically fine, but if you are familiar with the ""Jazz in Paris"" series from Gitanes (later Verve), the series comes in distinctive CD packaging with liner notes and information on the recording venue. This copy doesn't have any of that, just a reproduction of the original series front cover."
3,Wah-wah-blah,"I remember getting it. I'm pretty sure I listened to it. I just don't remember it. Sometimes that's good in a soundtrack; unobtrusive. I prefer soundtracks that I will remember, but that's just me. The soundtrack does have to fit the move. Lest I sound overly negative, I don't remember regretting the purchase, which I would have if it I had disliked it."
3,Murder Among Neighbors,"An enjoyable read I like Kate and her daughter, not too sure about the other characters in the book. Maybe there was just too many other characters and not enough detail about each one. The ending was done really great and parts of the book were kind of just ""too much like all the other women sticking their nose where it doesn't belong"" in cozy's. But will read more of her books!"
3,Interesting background to monetary systems,"Although this book was published around the 70's, not much seems to have changed. Its an interesting book and explains some of the ways in which monetary systems fleeced populations in the distant past."
1,Absurdly short life...,"The product works as advertised, EXCEPT for life of the product, which to me is key. I have never gotten close to the 15,000 page life Ricoh says this PCU is supposed to offer. I went through four of them, one about every 3,000-4,000 pages. I gave up and went with a different printer, as the costs of this PCU was eating me alive."
3,"Contains essential oils, not great on my diaper laundry","I used the mountain green free for diaper laundry with my first son and never had a problem. No buildup, no rashes, and it got the diapers clean. I bought this for a replacement when my second son was born and we had many problems. I finally switched to allens, which I don't think cleans them as well, but doesn't react with his skin."
5,Connected to the history,"When I purchased this book, I was a bit worried that I would not fit in. As one would think with the title of this book. You would think you should be of the Italian heritage, or that you could only be a Witch from a family connection. Nothing could be further from the truth. this book takes to the blood lines of the craft in Italy, I like the history and even though the craft is a family tradition before the end of the book you realize that you too are accepted."
4,The depressing truth,"There has been much argument on whether ravens books are authentic strega or italian flavored wicca. Both claims are true as you will see as I explain it. What you are actually learning about in his books is a tradition he founded in 1981 that he calls the aridian tradition. It is a blend of some elements of the Triad traditions and Modern wicca. He even says this in his book italian witchcraft if you read the intro on page xvi,He admits that these are modern rites and not old world rites. He also admits he was not taught strega by his family and he wasnt raised in a strega famly. His mother did teach him some italian folklore and magick tho. But he learned strega from outside teachers. What he presents is an outer court version of an italian tradition. He admits he cant publish pure strega as hed be breaking oaths. Dont believe me check out his website he explains it all. If ya need the link email me and ill sent it."
2,Mistitled!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It should have been called 'Hereditary ITALIAN Witchcraft, Secret of the Old ITALIAN Religion'. (...)So one star off for a misleading title, one star off for his bias and a third for small mistakes like the one on page 47 concerning Demeter. This goddess was an earth goddess as demonstrated by her ability to control the seasons and role as harvest mother, NOT an underworld deity. That honor was solely her daughter Persephone's.However, if you are interested in italian witchcraft this would probably be a great beginners book. The myths are beautiful and unique to anything else I've read and his re-interpretation of woodcuts from 'Compendium Maleficarum' are very interesting.If you are not interested in Italian Witchcraft, it is a waste of time and money. (...)"
1,F-,"One of my best friends is the real thing, and I can tell you, this ain't what they look like.I can quote historians, too, but that doesn't mean my work has historical merit...This book fails academically. If prepared as a thesis, it'd be indefensible."
5,YUMMY!,Love this muffin mix. 1/2 cup water and it is in the oven! I always add the zest fron one lemon to intensify the lemon flavor. Try them!
5,beauty and durable,"very beauty and durable, it spins with a low breezze, my little son see it for hours when spins"
5,One Evening in Chicago: Bob Franke,"Bob Franke is one of the great troubadours of our time. His poetry is great-hearted, deep and wise. Some of his songs still bring me to tears, like, on this album, the song Thanksgiving Eve. Its chorus goes like this:What would you do with your days but work and hope?Let your dreams bind your work to your play.What can you do with this moment of your lifeBut love 'till you've loved it away."
4,Good acapella music and REALLY funny lyrics,These guys were actually as warped as I am. Kudos on this CD.
3,Beautiful and informative but not helpful to me.,"This book is full of beautiful pictures and is well written. However, I was expecting a book about the average art-deco home. This book featured only the more extravagant homes of the time. It did not help me decide how to furnish my modest 1930's home."
2,Not a book to hold my interest!,"Problems on two fronts with this book for me. First, the editing by the publisher is quite poorly done, I found many of those mistakes and it detracted from the story for me.I also felt the writing to be on a very elementary level. Seems to me the romance was revisited in much the same way time after time.The back cover indicated there would be some excitement, which I expected would fire things up, but that turned out to be near the final forth of the novel and lasted for 2 or 3 pages. A ""come-on"" I now feel is pretty deceiving.Over-all I'm sorry to have spent this kind of money on this poorly written and uninteresting novel. I truly was disappointed."
1,worst ever,"I never felt the need to write a review, I love most of my threehundred lesbian novels, however this one couln't go unnoticedI totally agree with M.E.Martin; this is a very poorly written book, no depth in caracters, repeating the same lines in every chapter and a mix-up with the names. The editor did a lousy job...The storyline may have been a nice one, but it need a lot of work to make it a good book."
2,Only USB 1 speed!,"Beware, although this reader is ""compatible"" with USB 2.0, it's transfer speed is USB 1.0 (i.e. very slow). I guess you can't expect that much for $6, but for any modern camera's images this reader is painfully slow."
3,Slow but small,"Convenient? Yes. Slow? Also yes. About five minutes for about a hundred six megapixel images.Put one in the glove compartment for emergencies. But don't make it your daily driver.The ""pen cap"" looks like I will loose it easily."
2,"Mostly descriptive, little practical how-to-techniques",The author has developed an entire lexicon for OBEs which makes reading this book somewhat difficult. He seems to be a prolific projector although his experiences are atypical. There is little here for a novice to really use.
3,research tool,a interesting insight into the governments of the two sides before the great war. this book should not be taking in isolation and is more a useful tool for the student of the great war as opposed to a general read. this is an excellent research tool but always remember that history is written by the victorious.
2,cassette lovers beware,"The bummer with this player is a little rubber drive belt, very very thin, which busts after minimal use. I had to call Sony to get a replacement belt, and disassembling the player is not easy. For all the fine technology that went into this product, its a shame to have it wasted by a flimsy belt."
4,Sony Boombox,"My wife & I really like this little machine. Very portable, easy to use, and the sound is big enough to fill our dance studio (size of a small gymnasium). Good value for the price."
1,Would probably love it if it ever arrives....,"This item was ordered for me as a birthday gift in June...it is now September and I still have not received it. So despite the ""Ships in 1-2 days"" note on there, beware that it will most likely be longer. I think Amazon said it would ship by September 9th. Still a very long time to wait."
5,A must read Mystery!,"This novel was incredible from start to finish. It moved along so quickly, yet never once did I feel cheated. Everything was throughly explained. A clever plot with twists that keep you guessing. The characters were so real. I felt as if I knew each one of them personally until the story ended. I had a great time reading 'Quiet'. I highly recommend it! Lisa"
5,"Quiet, He Might hear You","I was very happy with this mystery. All the reviews here are true, this novel is a top notch mystery. I recommend it highly. Zane's girl"
1,"Weak characters, weak plot, predictable ending","A friend of mine gave me ""Quiet He Might Hear You"" to read. I was thoroughly disappointed. The plotline of the ""skeletons in the closet"" theme that Monyer pounds into the reader, page after page, was too cliche, and her development of the characters was even more trite. The ending was also very predictable, in that Monyer's obviously tried to end the book ""unpredictably."" I would recommend this book for a quick, thoughtless beach read; but if you're looking for substance, look elsewhere."
1,Not paid,"I usd the advanced search option to find a highly rated book. After reading this book I have to assume that readers must have been paid or had some other motive to write a five star review. Compared to other mystery thrillers I have read, the writing was sophmoric and story unbelievable. This book was less than OK. Perhaps it was suspenseful so I read through to the end but had the sense I had wasted my time when I was through. I hope others are not tempted to purchase as I was. I have learned to stick to relying on friends recommendations and/or search for national book award winners/finalists when I am searching for a good read."
5,Five Stars that's for sure,"I got this through Amazon I really, really loved it. I'm keeping my eye out for new releases from Nadine. This mystery was really a great read. Kathy"
4,Another Wonderful storie from Disney.,"This is not a nightmare for kids and on one of the reviews on here is rediculous. This is a very good story, one of my favorites infact.I hope that you don't think magic is too scary for your child. my child my not be exactly like yours but when she is scared or sad she wants me to put in a princess collection video and it makes her feel better with all their song and morals that make you feel good inside. i think that just incase your child is scared easily that you should wait till they are 5. Cause usaully 5 yearolds are not scared as easily as 2,3,and 4 year olds."
2,Nightmare for kids,"I am 5 years old. I hated this movie. It sure did scare me to see the princess becoming a jackal and taking over the screen.It gave me a ten-week nightmare! The review on the back of the box made this movie sound like a fun honeymoon, but this was more of a horror movie. Kids beware!"
1,Who knows?,"So now,""The Greek"" killed Hoffa.From all the info out there,It looks as though 100 guys were involved in his demise.But ""the Greek""? Nah;I don't think so.""Blutto did it"".Ask Popeye!"
5,Film Worthy,"if you have read this book you will understand the need for it to be a feature film. it is almost impossible to get a copy of this book. ""the powers that be"" made sure of that. i presently own the film rights to make it . the script is done.afters 2 years of work .. now all i need is a green light . interested? contact me joe droneheads@aol.com"
2,So So Mob story,"The more mob story's I read, and I've read most of them, I find that they all conflict each other as to dates, relationships to each other, and authenticity. Our thirst for mob literature is such that, with respect to Contract Killer, the author seem's to take huge liberty in his description of events that leads one to question wether or not this book borders on fiction.True readers of mob literature will see right through this story."
2,Not Bad but is it true?,"It's not a bad book but I wonder how much of what he says he did is actually true. If you red alot of mafia books, like me, You don't find many new stories except Jimmy Hoffa. He says he was there but I could say the same thing. There is no one to back him up except Jimmy Coonan, and I doubt he will. As long as you read this with a large grain of salt in mind, it's entertaining. New versions of old stories. If you want read a real book about the mob, read ""Murder Machine"" by Jerry Capeci and Gene Mustain. It's the best of all of them."
4,tony the greek,"Hey, I want to read this book but cannot find it anywhere. Please E-mail me at kdokan1074@aol.com if you know where I can get a copy at areasonable price."
3,Good basic DVD player; small profile,"In reading online reviews I was under the impression that this DVD player would do upsampling of DVDs to 720p (effective). Unfortunately, it's the next model up from this one. Nonetheless, this player is nicely made, the price is right, and you really can't go wrong if you want a good basic DVD player."
1,Failed after about a year,"My 393 just failed after about a year of use. Was great up to now, but out of the blue (we just watched a DVD a few days ago) it has started showing distorted images on and off. Even with no disc in the player, the default Pioneer image or the setup menus are distorted so I know it's the player.Maybe just a fluke, but I wouldn't buy another one."
5,excellent product,I bought this region free DVD player a few weeks ago. It works very well. It was easy to install and I was able to watch movies in the European format in a few minutes.
1,12 months of satisfaction...then KAPUT!!,"This DVD player came as a part of Pioneer home theater system. I bought this system that included this DVD player, a receiver and 5 speakes and subwoof. Purchased this item in November 2006 and have used it without any worries until today 12/02/07 i was watching a DVD and the the DVD player shut off. I could not get the DVD player to power back on. Called Pioneer customer service and they are not open on the weekend.I went down to the basement and brought up my generic ""Cyber-Home"" DVD player I bought in 2002 and hooked it up. It works!!Pioneer is a name brand people are supposed to trust and the DVD player breaking down in one year is deeply disappointing."
1,beware,do not buy this dvd player if you are looking for multi region . It works only for us-canada dvd
2,Not Region Free,I bought this item based on the reviews saying that it would be region free. It just keeps spitting my PAL DVDS out. Plays US fine. Any suggestions?
4,Great Mix - Awesome Tracks,"This is a fantastic, well-mixed, two disc set. It's what you're looking for if you want to be able to put in some techno/trance and not touch your CD player for a few hours. Its not totally what I expected from a South Beach mix as it isn't as full of some of the native/tribal beats with lots of bass and drum mixing as I've heard in South Beach lately - but its still a great piece of work that'll keep you moving. I recommend it!"
4,Superior collection,"I am a John Rutter fan. This disc contains 'favorites' from earlier Collegium albums plus additions I had never heard. I do wish that several of the new tunes here did NOT begin with the now tired, trying, predictable piccolo intro; having said that, if you get PAST that some of the new tunes contain lightness, humor and a 'bright' quality. Overall, well worth it!"
5,Plethora of wonderful music,This is a wonderful collection of Rutter's Christmas works. There are many hours of great listening ahead of me for years to come. A very worthy investment and it never disappoints.
2,Product did not perform to desired expectations.,"The product was purchased for a Nissan PatheFinder 2002. Later it was discovered it did not fit and then the connector broke. Not sure why, since it was purchased for daughter's vehicle and I don't have the part yet to look at it... This may be one of those issues where the product may not have really been correct for the vehicle, which is not the manufacturer problem but the order processing at Amazon.. Therefore, ""A word to wise. Always make sure the product is made for the correct vehicle and model""."
5,Hawthrone good or bad?,"I thought this book is pretty good except for the kissing. The person telling the story is Valerie Moran. The other characters are Basil Harris (who is a newcomer). Bob Short who is only in the book for a short time. A music teacher by the name of Mrs. Gottsman. A history teacher, his name is Mr. Kramer. A subsitute named Ms. Walters. Troublemakers Jim Argus and Dennie Plover. And one more character Jan Draper."
5,I love them!,These are the best camisoles I have ever owned. They stay in place and are very comfortable. I have both colors and use them under all types of shirts. More than I can say for any bra I have bought lately!
1,Boring,I like to play regular solitare and looked for this game but was very disappointed in the choices it gave. Maybe if your 8 or 9 this would be fun but the antics were a drag. Took it off the computer after 5 minutes.
1,Disappointment,"For older persons, the cards and mahjjong tiles are too small. Need to be larger so they are more visible for playing."
3,It's OK but not Great,"I have had this package for about a month and have played it on occasion. It works fine on XP and Win7.The program does not run with a full screen window and there are so many different games I never heard of it is almost too much effort to go through the menu to look for a familiar game.When I play the game it shows the possible moves with a Red slash on the cards, this is good as the small size of the cards makes it difficult for us older folks to see them easily.The ant animations are cute but I have not seen them too often as the games are very challenging.If you have good eyes and like to try lots of different games of Solitaire then this is a good package for you."
3,Just Okay,"I was really impressed with all of the reviews, so I baught this game for my mother. She found it was eazy to instal but very hard to play. I tried it out and understood where she was coming from. This game is really hard to play."
1,I returned this book!!,"This book is proof that you can't (or shouldn't) make a silk purse out of a sow's ear! I would wear 10% of what is shown in the book, not more than that. Make no mistake, I DO value creativity, if and ONLY if, the finished product is pleasing to the eye. Most of the projects in this book looked like a preschooler made them from junk fished out of a trash barrel at the hardware store. A necklace made from shriveled orange peels?! Some of the items looked positively dangerous to wear; sharp pieces of jagged metal!..."
1,Not at all fantastic,"I actually took this book out of the library prior to purchasing it (thank goodness !) Unless you really value recycling and like REALLY eclectic jewelry, don't bother. The book is short on basic jewelry techniques such as attaching clasps; and frankly, I agree with other reviewers that most items look like they were made by a pre-schooler - there is seriously an entire chapter on pasta necklaces ! Items made from golf tees, computer parts, candy ?! And truly, some items are made with wire screen and cut tin or aluminum without benefit of any finishing to the edges, causing safety concerns. There are so many other good books out there - if you want one for younger children (up to pre-teens) I recommend ""The Girls' World Book of Jewelry""."
2,A euro book that lost some in the translation,"This is another book on jewelry making that should not have been brought to the U.S. for sale. It is filled with projects that are more suited to teens and preteens. Only one or two things of interest. And they can be had in other books. Check to see if it's in your local library before you buy! I own it,but will be selling it."
2,great diva sounded pushed,"As a big fan of Joan Sutherland, I think she sounds tired and pushed here. Try her 1964 decca recording of Norma instead."
3,Not a great Norma or Sutherland,"Troyanos is the most exciting presence and singer in this production. Both Norma (Sutherland) and Pollione are not great, but they are more exciting when Troyanos is on stage. Sutherland must have been history by the time this was made. I have heard her on cd's and I know her voice was tremendous. This DVD does not convey at all why she became famous and was called ""La Stupenda."" Not at all.The only thing I can say about Pollione is he looks pretty good in short armour, remembering he's supposed to be a warrior (therefore solid looking); his singing did not interest me.The production itself is not so great: the sound vanishes periodically (during arias!) and the sub-titles are erratic at best, vanishing for whole chunks of time. I would not buy another disc from this company unless I were certain that production values (and subtitles) were better and the star singers in better form."
4,Norma,"I have a very little English. I don't understand well, and I made many mistakes when I try write or speach English. I'd like to buy this DVD, but I need to Know if is possible whash(?) it in DVD PLAYER sold in Brazil. Is it universal process recording, or is specific to United States or Europe? Are you understanding me? Please, answer my question, about Norma and others DVD of your site. Thank you"
3,Hard Of Hearing User,"This item is OK, just to use for occassional use. Wires are very cheap quality. Looks like ikt will break or rip off at any time. I would not suggest it for someone who speaks on phone a lot. Get neckloop bluetooth."
1,Delicate,This only lasted two weeks before I had to replace it. The brand new model seems to be holding up.
4,a very helpful reference book,"I found no information under the catalogue of Taiwan, China. There are at least 10 medical colleges in Taiwan and all have their own teaching hospitals with advanced equipment and excellent doctors. I guess the only reason that Taiwan being ruled out from the directory is politics."
5,A Classic,Still Rings Skills and Techniques has been the textbook of national champions. John W. Hinds is an experienced coach of 14 State Championship teams and I highly recommend this book to any serious gymnast looking to improve his technique to Championship level.
2,A Little Dry,"This book is a bit on the dry side. Plus, I didn't notice - until I received it - that the book isn't an authorized biography in any way. (Yes, I'm aware it says a statement to that effect on the front of the book, but I didn't think to read the small print.) As an avid ""I Love Lucy"" fan, I've read a bunch of biographical books on Lucille Ball. I was excited to find something about Viv and Bill. What a disappointment. First of all, you question everything you read (since it's not authorized or endorsed). Second, it reads a lot like a dry news article. I found it to be a disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"I had looked forward to reading this book for some time, but what a disappointment! The writing is merely adequate, the research something anybody with an internet connection could accomplish. The text amounts to little more than a list of productions that Vivian Vance and William Frawley participated in. The only pictures are a few publicity stills that again, anybody could get their hands on. Many of the quotes are surprisingly boring, making me wonder why the author bothered to put them in. All of that said, there is still a glimmering of interest here, because the two subjects are of such interest. They do deserve a full biography each, although it is interesting to find both of them profiled, however vaguely, in the same volume. There is a biography of Vivian Vance out; I don't know if there is one of Bill Frawley or not, and if not, I guess this volume will have to serve."
3,Slow and Tedious,"As an ""Unauthorized Biography,"" ""Meet the Mertzes"" reveals little scandalous information and concerns itself with exposing tedious details and silly criticism.Fascinating for the hard core fan, a painful read for those of us on the outskirts."
1,Your service was great as always but the book sucked!!,"Amazon always has shown me excellent service. This book ""The Mertzes"" was a book did not even finish reading. I did not like reading about what a jerk William Frawley was. Would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Boring!!!!!,"This book had so much useless information I could barely get through it. What a waste of paper! I have loved watching the Mertzes on I Love Lucy, so I bought this book to learn a bit more about them. Well, with the info that is in the book, that task could have been accomplished in 10 pages. Instead there is a lot of useless, BORING, information that no one cares about. Furthermore, It paints such ugly pictures of both of those people. I am sorry I every bought this rag. If you love Lucy & the Mertzes, you will honor them by NOT purchasing this book!"
3,Love those Mertzs!,"I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would.I love books on what I call ""footnote""people!To me,the journeyman actors' stories are more interesting than the big stars.William Frawley was apparently just as crusty in real life as he was on the show.He and Vivian Vance couldn't stand each other,yet created a memorable tv duo still fondly remembered today.A must read for the ""I Love Lucy"" fan."
5,Great!,This is an informative and entertaining double biography. I've always loved Fred and Ethel-- and this book is loaded with information and anecdotes about the actors who played them. I particularly loved all the stories about Frawley. What a character!
3,Good Biography,"While it sometimes summarizes too much, it gives a lot of insight into the lives of Vivian and Bill. This is the only book to learn about the interesting life of Bill Frawley. If you read The Other Side of Ethel Mertz, the book will seem repetitive."
3,I loved the Mertzes,"A good read that has many stories that I did not know about these two actors. There are a lot of fun facts, but overall it is a kind of sad and lonely tale. I give it three stars for effort. Worth the price if you want to know more about ""Fred and Ethel""."
3,Second Bananas,A good overall look at what it means to be a second banana in the world of show business
4,Meet the Mertzes,"As a lover of Lucy and Ethel, I wanted to find out as much as possible about them. This book was very informative, more background information on both Fred and Ethel than you can imagine, but alot of basic details that I never knew."
2,Lukewarm,"Interesting read, but the same theme of ""Vivian disliked Bill"" and ""Bill disliked Vivian"" kept repeating over and over without giving out too many details. I like real juicy, gossipy insiders view but this only skimmed the surface of the two actor's relationships to one another. The book mostly focused on the two individually rather than both of them together. You get a detailed description of Bill and Vivian's acting careers and how they evolved, which in my opinion, wasn't that interesting. I had to skim over a lot of pages because it just wasn't that insightful. ""Next Bill went to this play. Then he went to that play. Then this one. etc. etc."" Come on, give us the scoop! :) So that's why I only rated it 2 stars. I'm a huge I Love Lucy fan, but this book doesn't even have a reserved spot on my bookshelf. I'm selling it, anyone interested? Like new condition!"
2,Disappointed,"Meet the Mertzes: The Life Stories of I Love Lucy's Other CoupleNot what I was expecting. The book mostly contains information easily found on the internet. Goes into way too much detail in listing Bill and Vivian's movie credits, etc. and doesn't have a whole lot of info about their personal lives."
2,little more than a wikipedia entry,"As a big fan of the I Love Lucy series, and one who really enjoyed a biography about Lucille Ball, this book was a snooze. It was full of citations of which play, film, or interview they were in. There were mild quoted remarks from people of the era. But it was pretty dry, like a long Wikipedia entry about Bill and Vivian. It got to where I was jumping ahead by pages. I finally gave up out of boredom."
5,"lotsa fun for ""lucy"" lovers","Loved this book! It's an entertaining read, and I learned so much about those beloved actors who played the Mertzes. Highly recommended!"
3,Expectations,"Its just another Dr. Seuss book. It is not what I thought it was, but my little girl will like it all the same. I just thought it would have more room to write happy birthday or something. I really do not know what I was expecting."
2,Defective book,"After I gave this book to my grandson for his birthday, my daughter noticed that it is defective. All of the pages are jagged and cut off at the top, and the inside cover is attached off center and looks very sloppy."
5,Great Seuss Birthday Book,Perfect book for a grandsons birthday. He loves Dr. Seuss books and loves to be read to. Perfect book for him.
5,Birthday Book,I bought this book so I could read it to my son every year on his birthday. I have read it to him a few times before
4,birthday party,"We recently attented the 80th birthday party of a family member. The guest of honor was placed on a throne with a crown on his head. The story teller had enlisted the help of family members to play the parts of the bird and other characters, each wearing items that related to the story. It was lots of fun and all ages enjoyed it, including the guest of honor when it was his time to participate in the narration. It inspired us to use this for that special over 50 birthday party."
2,All ads,"I was very disappointed upon receiving this item. I ordered ""Happy Birthday To You"" by Dr. Seuss for my daughter's first birthday. We're having a Dr. Seuss party for her and I thought it would be perfect! However, the cover of the book has a giant advertisment (which is not removable) to buy books and get so many free. It looks tacky and then the first dozen or more pages inside the book are all tear out postcards to complete and return for the book special. I just wanted the book as it appears online- plain and simple. I'm very unhappy with my purchase."
5,Great book!,I ordered this book for my son's first birthday. His party theme was Dr. Seuss so I let all the guests sign the book as a keepsake. It turned out to be a great idea and the book is awesome!
2,You'd better have a good teacher or a good science background.,"The title is not kidding when it calls itself ""College"" physics. Anyone using this textbook needs to be familiar with algebra and geometry as well. This book will not hold your hand and walk you through the basics of physics. It throws you in, head-first, and it's up to you to sink or swim."
1,Horrible textbook,"This textbook is in no way helpful.This book explains concepts by using things you don't know.The writers of this book really assume you know a lot about physics already.Sometimes they don't even bother explaining a concept. For example, I get that momentum is equal to velocity times mass, but what IS momentum? Okay, thanks for giving me an example of relative velocity without telling me what it is or how to solve for it. This book is incredibly frustrating.I do not recommend it."
3,College Physics,"I don't think I am a good source to review this book, since I hate physics. I am sure the authors of this book worked hard trying to write a great physics book, but I just don't get it. Maybe some day I will understand the subject."
1,This hero is NO hero,"The ""hero"": selfish, mean, cheater, weak in character, whiny, self-pity (why is my life so bad, woe is me - let me abuse someone else because I'm too lazy and selfish to care of my own life).The heroine - liked her for the most part but she put up with his abuse (verbal and emotional) and then when he did have his about-face she made it too easy on him. She didn't require he do anything to atone for his abuse of her."
2,Heroine is too good for undeserving hero,"Mannering, the novel's supposed hero, is so unappealing and thickheaded that it defies even romance novel logic that are spunky heroine should fall in love with him. Mannering spends the entire novel in love with another woman and treats the loveable heroine, who is his wife, so badly that you actually hope the author kills him so our heroine could find a worthy mate. Not a noteworthy book."
2,Unappealing hero,"The heroine Caroline is wonderful, but I agree with another reviewer that her love interest Mannerling, is exceptionally unappealing. Throughout almost the entire book he in love with another woman, even though everyone else in London knows her to be evil. He treats Caroline terribly, and the turn-around ending wasn't enough of a ""reward"" for this reader."
3,Don't Look Back,"Just finished this Kindle download by Karin Fossum. Purchased several of her books last year at $.99 each through an Amazon daily deal. Had not heard of her but figured i could not go wrong at that price. The book has its suspenseful moments, and falls flat at others. Overall the book is a good read, though the story could have been more dynamic. Considering the setting and plot, less may be more."
3,basic murder mystery,"This is a good murder mystery book to read, nothing really new or anything. I give it 3 stars because it does drag in spots, still a good read to see a non-american writer."
3,Great book but offensive language,This is the first book I have read by Karin Fossum. She is a great writer that understands the psychology of human make-up and incorporates this into her characters. She keeps you guessing throughout the book on who-dun-it as she weaves the story around a number of interesting people.I especially like Inspector Sejer. He reminds me of Inspector Foyle on Foyle's War (a BBC detective series). Truely and enjoyable story line totally keeping your interest.There is some bad language in the book but not too much. The Lord's name is used in vain and I find that highly offensive and totally unnecessary. I read one other of her books since and the language was much worse and bad enough that I decided to return the other books I had bought by her. There were parts of that book that every other word was a cuss word and offensive ones at that. It is bad enough to hear the language in person. I don't want to pay for books that I have to read it as well.
4,Don't Look Back,"Inspector Sejer is an interesting and cerebral character; shows ""human kindness"" during the investigation, not overly physical confrontation--quite refreshing in a murder investigation tale. Plan to read more of this author's work."
2,Very dissapointing mystery,"It is not a bad book. It is very readable. But as a mystery it is very, very poor. Actually, I can hardly call it a mystery. You can work out who done it, and why early on. The book is virtually without any twists, and surprises."
2,I agree that this plot mischaracterizes down syndrome people,"The characterization of the young man with Down Syndrome is offensive, incorrect and distracting. The book is very readable, but unpleasant. Many questions are unanswered. I personally think that leaving questions unanswered or an ending ambiguous is a cheap way to affect artistry. I call it the ""Lady or the Tiger"" crutch. I hate the ending. Looking at the plot lines of KArin Fossum's books, too many involve murdered children. I can live without that, myself."
3,"A decent book, but overpriced in digital format.","Not a bad little book, your typical police procedural but set in Sweden. Procedures are different there so the thing had a bit of a different flavor. I picked this up when it was free, but I think I'd have been ticked if I'd paid $9.50 for it, as there's nothing here you can't actually pick up at the check-out line for less."
4,Believable Characters,"It was a very interesting read with several possible murderers. It was easy to keep the names straight as the author didn't have so many it was confusing even using Norwegian names. A few unbelievable situations and ""red herrings"" but I would read another book by this author."
3,wonderful film for fans of Samantha Mathis,"The Simian Line has a fantastic cast with excellent performances from Harry Connick Jr., William Hurt, Cindy Crawford and Eric Stoltz. The storyline is fascinating and compelling. And, especially, if a fan of Samantha Mathis, this film is a must have. Samantha gives, what I believe to be, one of her best performances."
2,"No kidding, this is old news...","This book was a waste of money for me. No kidding women need to exercise to keep the fat off and your matabolism up! Everything she said I knew 5 years ago. If you don't know anything at all about nutrition, this book may be informative, but there are better ones out there. Try Atkins, he knew what he was talking about. After 4.5 months after pregnancy I have lost 45lbs already. Good luck."
2,Low GI diets do NOT have to be this confusing!,"I bought this book in hopes of finding a better understanding of low GI foods. A list of low GI foods would have been nice, or help on eating out. Realistically, noone is going to stick to eating her recipes for the rest of their lives. Some of the ingredients I had never heard of and there was no way the rest of my family would eat ANY of them. I was doing triple the work in the kitchen not only to just make meals for myself and different ones for my family, but trying to prepare ahead my 5 mini meals for the following day. I don't know about you, but I would rather spend less time in the kitchen and more with my children! The one good thing this book has done is challenged me to do more research elsewhere on this subject."
2,Most Confusing Book I've Read,"I agree with the reader form Europe who complained about the recipes needing strange ingredients. For example, whey protein powder is called for (1 Tbsp) and it is sold in a huge canister for $14.99. No other recipe in the book calls for it. Also many of the recipes make food for 8. Who has that big a family-as if my family would eat any of this food? I like what I've made so far, but my kids? Never.The book's format has wide margins with pithy quotes here and there, no doubt to make it look simple and clear. I found it to be anything but clear! And I am highly educated, I might add. I was really fooled by all these great reviews. Who are these people, friends of the author?I certainly haven't lost any weight in the two weeks I've been on it and I'm worried I'll gain with all this extra fat in the diet.Good luck to those who try it!"
3,Simply Not Impressed,"After reading the rave reviews of this book, I decided to give it a try. I've been recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism and I'm ready to try anything to feel better and get rid of all of this weight I've gained over the years. However, I find this diet a little difficult to swallow as a mother of two extremely picky children. The ""mini meals"" sounds like a great idea, except for the fact that I would have to eat TWELVE mini meals a day, which is way excessive. I would never leave the kitchen.Will this diet work? Absolutely! I'm just not entirely sure the average stay-at-home mom will find this very appealing. It would be just as easy for me to increase my exercise and eat healthier."
5,Fine tailored to a woman's body.,A wonderful weight loss book for women. It was fascinating and showed in detail how to work with our bodies to safely and effectively lose weight.
3,"Inferior Quality, But Only Option for the JX10","My original broke while in my pocket. These replacements are of the same inferior quality. The metal is lightweight, but flimsy. It breaks at the point where it attaches to the plastic clip portion. Good headset, bad earhook.My advice: Keep the Jabra device with earhook in a sheath to protect it. And if you need another, get it from Jabra - they'll send you a set of replacements for free - something I found out too late. Apparently they are aware of the issue. Props to Jabra for taking care of their customers."
1,seller unresponsive,These earhooks do not fit my Bluetooth. I've emailed the seller two times requesting instructions for return and refund. I am still waiting to hear from them.
2,Jabra Earhook,Have had to purchase multiple replacement earhooks. The earhook is very poorly made and breaks easily. Will soon replace Jabra bluetooth for the Plantronics Discovery 975 - a much higher rated bluetooth.
4,Earhook Jabra JX10,A simple product. Fits right on the JX10. Does cause a bit of pain after prolonged use (1-2 hours). Delicate!!!!
3,Group Workout,"This is a video of three guys taking turns lifting weights for a full-body workout. Presses, curls, pulls, squats, and ab exercises are included.As indicated to me by the seller (who viewed the DVD and responded to my questions before my purchase) there is no nudity or sexuality and those ""tags"" placed on this product are incorrect and should be removed. The guys workout without shirts.This video falls short by not providing instruction during the weightlifting (which would have greatly improved the value). Isiah Brooks ""advises"" the guys about a technique to perform squats to provide better muscle definition. Additional instruction throughout the rest of the workout would have made this a valuable tool.Extras are talks by two of the guys (one including motivation), an arm wrestling match, and two of the guys talking and ""play"" wrestling."
2,Raw Workout,I was looking forward to seeing guys weightlifting and muscle training nude but they are not. Three magnificent smooth young hunks never take more than their shirts off despite the gym being otherwise empty. More could have been made of this film.
1,Not the Best,"I bought this CD without looking or listening first, thinking it would be as wonderful as the ""Grammy Champion "" album...a BIG mistake. Although Solti's performances generally seem a bit "" hyperbolic"" to my ears (or maybe overly energetic), this CD is a non-stop ""rush job"", where he bolts through each (grindingly familiar!) piece. One to avoid."
5,A Masterpiece,"This is a wonderful guide to the history, production, and collecting of Lincoln cents. The date/mintmark analysis is particularly useful for consultation everytime I purchase one of these coins. I found no faults whatsoever with this book."
2,damage & OUT OF DATE MATERIAL,The item was not the current volume and it looked like it had been shipped about 5 times when it arrived. All the corners were curled and the cover was worn.
2,identity crisis,"It must have sounded great on paper. MM released some wonderful collaborations with the Red Hot & ... albums, and he's done some great work with the Beasties. The problem here is he's trying to write pop songs, and he can't cut it. He's forcing himself to write the 3-4 minute pop tune ala World Party or Lenny Kravitz. Only about four cuts on the record are keepers. Way too much filler. I was hoping for an oddball instrumental album, something surprising. The only thing surprising here is how unsurprising it is. The only button getting pushed here is ""try again""."
5,Keyboard Masterpiece,"This album was clearly one of the best albums last year. The smooth, rythmic sounds along with the low key local make this album a real find"
5,"Very useful, practical help for parents","Marie has lived with an ADHD kid, and has not only survived, but thrives on helping other parents find resources and help for their kids! Her approach is lively, caring and flexible. Highly recommended by a clinical psychologist/neuropsychologist, who offers EEG biofeedback in her practice!"
1,Beware Plastic Bar,"I thought the price on this looked very attractive. They get there by including a cheap plastic towel bar on what are attractive porcelain ends. Not wanting cheap plastic in nicely tiled bathroom, these are going back. It was only after a I read a customer's review that I saw ""plastic"". It's not in the Amazon description and it should be. That would have saved me a return.BTW, if you don't mind a plastic bar, the set at least looks nice."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"This is not high quality software.The program is slow and to simple even for my 18 month old daughter.I have a top of the line Gateway computer,and I have never seen anything move as slow as this.She loves the Wiggles so I feel we got are moneys worth she can look at the one of the three videos included in the software ( they are only small pieces). I thought we would get a better program with Disney names on the product."
2,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Trust me when I say, don't waste your money, this game is not worth it no matter how much of a Wiggle fan your child is. My son is a huge fan so I got this for him thinking it would be the perfect thing to introduce him to the computer. After we played each game just one time he was bored and wanted to get down to go play and that isn't like him when it comes to anything dealing with The Wiggles, he eats, breathes, and sleeps The Wiggles."
2,Better for Older Kids and No Wiggle Music,"No Wiggles music is incorporated in the game. The computer games are better designed for older kids. Games include Tic, Tac, Toe and maze games. Not the best children's computer game out there."
1,Poor VHS to DVD Transfer!,"I got this DVD and I am not amused about it. The picture quality is soft without good sharpness because the label BANKMUSIC did a simple VHS to DVD transfer with a bitrate of maximum 4900. It's a constant bitrate and so I think it's a DVD-recorder record. You can see some typical VHS dropouts.The sound of this DVD is poor, too because I think the real sound was mono and they upgrade it to stereo.The movie self is a good and cheesy eighties film with Sam Jones and in a little role Linda Blair but the DVD release is a fragment of jurassic time.Keep your money for better DVDs like this."
2,Not so good...,"Third rate martial arts knockoff whose only saving grace is an underused Linda Blair in several scenes as the damsel-in-distress. Suppose if you are a Blair completist who HAS to have every movie she's ever been in, this will be of use. Otherwise, avoid."
5,A Fresh new face in the Anime World part 3,"Fairy Tail, by far, is one of the best new animes to come out in years. Fairy Tail started in Japan about 2 years ago. Since then, it has become one of the most popular animes in Japan and America. The Story is gripping, the animation is very high quality, And this one is almost perfect for the whole family (I say almost because in Japanese, there are a lot of sex related jokes. I know that is not everyone's cup of tea so fair warning). Based on the cover, this boxset will end the conflict with Phantom, that was started in the last boxset, and will begin telling Erza's past and her connection to the battles ahead. If you are going to buy this series though, I would highly recommend that you buy the first 2 boxsets. This can be a very hard series just to jump into. But I can guarantee you, If this is a random buy, you won't be disappointed. I have already ordered mine. I hope this helps your decision."
4,"Interesting characters, twisting plot. Textures and layers.","I always liked Dorothy Sayers assumption that her readers were intelligent, educated and well read. Rosemary Auberg seems to start with the same assumption while leading her reader through interesting avenues. Her characters seem so real that one must decide if one is up to meeting them. Her clues so honest and wickedly devious they are a joy."
4,The Wiggles - It's Always Christmas With You!,This item was a Christmas present for a 5 year old and according to her mother she played it over and over again because she loved it so much.
4,Blue Sky,"A friend lent me a copy of ""The Healing Power of the Eucharist"". I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. If you are interested in deeping your connection with God, this is a must read! Thank you Father John for writing this book!"
4,"Good cable for the price, feels a little cheap","I got this cable to replace the super-cheap component cables that came with my SlingBox Pro HD (wonder when Slingbox will have HDMI). The stock cables with the SlingBox were picking up a lot of noise/interference from the power cables powering the cable box and the SlingBox itself and this noise is totally eliminated with this new cable.The only thing that really makes it feel cheap, imho, is the fact that the colored bands on the ends are essentially a thin plastic tape. They were already coming off of the connectors before I even opened the bag. Ultimately it's not a huge deal as it's obvious which of the cables are for video and which are for audio as the video cables are a tad thicker."
3,"expensive, rigid, good signal","I purchased this cable to connect video components in our home theater. The cable provides good signal quality, but it is very hard to fit into tight places. The cable is thick and rigid, and so a lot of space is needed behind the equipment. If you don't have 10 inches clearance, try more flexible cables."
2,Didn't enjoy this at all!,"I was looking forward to trying something new,however when I opened the noodles they were oily and had a rancid smell. I checked the date on the box and it was good for another year so I cooked it anyway.The sauce was good but couldn't get past the noodles.Maybe it was the type of oil they used. I threw it out and cancelled my subscription.I am afraid to order any other products of this kind. Any suggestions? Sorry, don't like to leave bad reviews."
3,OK in a pinch. Doesnt come close to real Pad Thai.,"OK in a pinch. Doesnt come close to real Pod Thai. For some reason it tastes better after it has cooled down to almost room temp, not sure why."
2,"Not as good as I thought, simple and bit too sweet, by far lag behind the Pad Thai from restaurant.","Not as good as I thought, simple and bit too sweet, by far lag behind the Pad Thai from restaurant."
2,Not worth it,"The noodles were super greasy out of the packaging and all in one big clump. Unlike other brands, these noodles did not unclump after cooking and no amount of stirring broke apart a large chunk of them that tasted like a ball of greasy dough. The sauce was pretty good but very thick and heavy for pad thai and had an artificially sweet taste (considering this is supposedly an ""all natural"" product). It does not look at all like the image on the box. For over 600 calories and 22 grams of fat I just don't think this brand is worth it when I could either have much healthier options from comparable brands or indulge in and enjoy real Thai food that tastes infinitely better. This wasn't terrible, but I definitely wouldn't spend my money on this product again."
4,music that touches the deepest part of the heart,wish you were here reaches to that part in all of us that truly believes in a love that goes beyond anything or anywhere that fate might take us
1,CAN'T HARDLY WAIT!!!,"I can't wait until this current trend of wimpy, lackluster, pop music runs it's course and we can hear real country music again. This is a prime example of what happens when you get all your musical inspiration by listening to the Young Guns soundtracks. Folks, do yourself a favor and buy Robbie Fulks."
1,Why is this in the Country section?,"This is not a country music album and should be in the easy listening category along with all his other albums. You might like this CD if you're new to the country scene because it sounds a lot like the easy listening music you've heard. But as a country CD...NO WAY! Mark, you have a good voice but try choosing better music in the future."
5,A very pleasant listening experience,"Like many others I bought the cd for one song, ""Don't laugh at me"". I had no idea who Mark Wills even was. After one play thru I new I had picked a winner and it has become one of my favorite cds. Every song on it is great, I'll 'gamble' on another of his cds anytime."
5,Wonderful!,"I have really seldom enjoyed a cd as much as this one. The songs and words really make you think. His voice is awesome. Keep it up, Mark!!!"
5,"A tear jerker, but a must buy CD!!! Excellent!!!","This is a must buy CD, excellent CD for people who are into slow, sad songs. ""Wish you were here"" and ""She's in Love"" will bring tears to your eyes. Mark Wills has proved his great, relaxing voice on this CD with all these wonderful songs. You will not be disappointed after hearing this CD. By far, the best CD I have ever owned."
3,It's a blackjack guide,It discusses the various rules of play in different casinos and shows the proper play based on the dealers up card and your hand as first devloped mathematically for Beat The Dealer.
2,Didn't cover much the type of blackjack that I play,Dwelled mainly on one to four deck games. I only play at the indian casino's hear; so I don't know if they still play one deck games where they deal down to the last card or not; but they don't around hear.
1,HELLO COULD PEOPLE PLEASE SHUT UP ABOUT WHAT DEATH METAL IS AND ACCEPT IT FOR WHAT IS,"Hi there I'm huge death metal fan, I love it, but I also accept it for what it is...BRUTAL, PRIMITIVE MUSIC! and that's why I like it. It's not art or some sort avante garde or DaDa art form that were going to look back at hundred years from now with great awe. So everyone shut the F&$# UP! You either like it or you don't...that's the way it will always be. Some People are post-modern and some people are naturalistic. It's just that simple."
1,What kind of Crap is this?,"MAn my friend to me to check these guys out, agh cough no talent. The music has no beat. All the vocalist does is do some queer pig grunting noise. Take my advice don't by this cd. Get Exhumed. They're way the hell better and actually have talent."
3,I have issues with this CD,Not bad...Not great either. Try to get it used if your gonna get it. There are better CD's to buy though.
5,F*cking mortician mannnn....,Im some one who is obsses with mortician since house by the cemetery... Till now this guys been making me nothing but happy with no dissapointing released album yet!I love hearing the horror skips cause im a horror movie fanatic show it just makes me love mortician even more. Be sure you support them!!
1,Ouch..........what happened?,"Relapse band ""Mortician"" had it going good there for awhile but I don't know what ... happened. This album totally [was bad]! If you listen to there old music and then compair it to there new music what do you notice? (Not much difference) But it seems like ""Domain of Death"" was put together to quick and cheap. Every song was horrible and needed to be re-adjusted.""House by the Cemetery"", and ""Zombie Apocalypse"" were excellent albums. But for some reason I think Will and Roger of Moritician lost something in this album.Now in there new album ""Darkest Day of Horror"" they pick right back up on the right track and it is once again enjoyable to listen to.I am not disrespecting Mortician I am just saying this CD needs to be put away in a place that no one will find it. Like 27 miles below the surface of the earth or thrown in the Atlantic ocean.Mortician ~ 0 stars out of 10 stars"
5,Greatest Hero of All Time!,"The most decorated soldier of any war, ever! Audie Murphy was a born leader and soldier and not one person ever disputed his many heroic actions. In fact, there were many eyewitnesses who confirmed them. This book reveals some facts not covered in other accounts of Audie's life. A good read."
2,Not the closest shave...,"I purchased this trimmer for my face and chest hair primarily. I didn't need to use any of the attachments, since I desired the closest trim possible. That being said, the clippers tended to pull at the hair, and I had to go over the spots previously shaven a few times before I was satisfied. I cannot say how this shaver would work for haircuts, but I can't imagine it would be any better. Spend more money for a better shaver. It's worth the investment."
2,negative,Didn't last very long once i took it apart to clean it never went back the way it was and later stopped cutting all together
1,Don't WASTE your money,"You'll need new blades soon, but REMINGTON wants you to buy a new unit, so REMINGTON DOES NOT SELL NEW BLADES.OK, so I bought a Newer MORE EXPENSIVE Model, with SELF SHARPENING BLADES...It lasted for FOUR HAIRCUTS- then the motor locked up. !#@$*&! Just a fluke, right? So I called 'customer service'... WHAT? THE WARRANTY IS JUST THIRTY DAYS???WARNING: don't call their 'Customer Service' if you have high blood pressure; they'll just hang up on you. When I tried to contact a supervisor, they were always ""in a meeting"" : no wonder they're going out of business. This is a perfect example of a company that's only survived this long on their Past Reputation;REMINGTON = poor products and worse service!"
2,Disappointed,"It does not work as smooth as the one I brought from Japan, but it works.However, after exactly 9 months, it stopped working. I don't even have a ""contact seller"" button to complain."
4,Remington hair cutter,"I have tried 4 different hair clippers over the years. This is one of the best and simplest to use. It cuts clean, evenly, quietly. I think it is one of the best products on the market.."
4,No problem...almost,"I have no idea how long I was using this, I got it as a Christmas present because I shave my head an opted to start doing it myself instead of going to a barber to have it done. It seems like it lasted me a while, eventually a roommate decided she was going to cut her cats hair after I told her know. All of a sudden it stopped working. I took it apart and found a lot of hair/fur that didn't belong to me.So, lesson learned, worked great for shaving my head, but keep it away from your roommates.It hasn't been the same. Now I'm going to look for something new."
2,You get what you pay for,"It's really cheap - It comes with a great sort of accessories but the main unit is really worthless. It worked for 3 or 4 hair cuts and it started running really slowly, like 1/10 of the normal power... I just threw it away and got a good quality clipper.You get what you pay for, I think. You can't expect a really good quality item in this price range. My advice is to pay a little more for something with a better quality so you don't need to buy it again so soon."
2,I got a bad one,The one I received was not sharp. Used it on straight hair and it did not cut well. It tugged and pulled at the hair even though the hair was short. I guess I just got a bad one.
1,Very disappointing.,"I purchased this set to keep my hair cut, as well as my nephews, and brother. The tabs on the smaller combs broke off on the second hair cut and now this is useless as they do not sell replacement guides for this set.I have never been disappointed with Remington before this but, unfortunately this has colored my opinion."
3,Will wear out on you fast,"I bought this a while ago to cut my own hair. Now that I'm older, there's much less hair to deal with and I can't really justify paying for haircuts when they all look bad regardless of how much I pay. So, I got the bright idea of getting this item on sale and doing my own hair. It worked great the first couple of times, but even though I oiled the blades, they went dull fast By the third haircut, it felt like it was yanking all my hair out instead of cutting it. Ouch! Plus, I looked totally retarded with clumps of hair sticking out amidst short cut hair. It took way to long to make it look right again."
2,"Great clipper, awful accessories","The clipper itself is excellent. Smooth, quiet and efficient. The combs - the parts that come with the clipper in general - are absolute trash. Rather than making them of a relatively soft (as in flexible) plastic, they made them with a brittle, hard plastic. Every hair guide comb that clips onto the trimmer has very small tabs which break if you look at them cross-eyed. I now have a trimmer that's only good for doing hair Vin Diesel style. I do not look good that way. Neither does my wife.The replacements are $5.99 plus shipping and handling. That total, with tax, is $14.36. The unit itself costs $14.95. Both are from the Remington website."
1,Huge waste of money!,"I honestly wish I had a video review for this clipper. My boyfriend got this from his Mom yesterday, his hair was about an inch and a half long. He's been shaving his head for over ten years. He read the instruction booklet, let it run for a minute and started to attempt to shave his head. The first shave started to pull the hair out and his scalp was bleeding. He did a few more clips and it continued to rip the hair out. I even tried to cut his inch and half long hair with scissors so it was even shorter. Even at half an inch the shaver was still ripping out hair. It claims that it is self sharpening and I have never seen a blade so dull! I can't believe someone inspected this product and thought that it was actually sell able. My boyfriend's head is covered in red spots and cuts from the hair being ripped out.THIS PRODUCT IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!"
2,"Good Trimmer, Horrible Attachments",I really like the electric trimmer and still have my old one I bought four years ago. However the new style plastic attachments that are included are almost worthless. The ones I received had a limited number of `fingers' or extensions that extend from the trimmer which can cause an uneven cut. I primarily use the 1/8 & 1/4 inch attachments which only had three to four extensions.
1,Remington HC-8017B,"Plain and simple... JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!!! Don't waste your money on this item. I used it once and it worked great. I just used it for the second time and it would even cut short hair. I went to file a return and the return window expired on Jan 31st. I guess it is true that you pay for what you get. Remington was a good brand I thought."
2,The first year is good and after it is horrible,"At the beginning everything was great the clippers cut well, but after a year it hurts when i cut my hair it pulls hair and you have to go back and forth on your head like 40 minutes to get a good cut, If you want to save money go for something better, I am thinking about throwing them away and getting one with better quality."
1,Not a good set of clippers at all,"I cannot recommend these clippers to anyone.For the money, of course, I did not expect a barber shop style cutter.I have an old pair of ""cheapies"" that have lasted me a long time that cost about the same, but they are great.These cutters are cheaply put together and the plastic ""bites"" into your skin with very sharp edges. Also the metal itself, if exposed, will give you a nice slice.The whole apparatus us clunky and not very well put together, I am afraid.Like I said, I didn't expect a master-series set of blades, but these are more Fischer Price than any of the 4 different sets of clippers I own.Don't waste your money."
3,Not bad for the price,"This product is OK for the price. If you take your time cutting hair it will do the job, but understand this is not a barber/salon quality hair trimmer. I think it needs a little more motor power - a little more oomph! It has all the parts needed for different lengths. Again, you have to take time for it to get all the hair to cut, but not a bad home product if you can persevere with it."
1,Worst clippers I've owned.,"I bought these a few months back and after a few cuts the 1/2"" guide broke. The guides are made of brittle, crappy plastic. I switched to the 3/4"" and it broke while I was putting it on. I have cut my own hair for the past 14 years and I've never had a set of clippers break so easily. The other ones I've owned have at least lasted a year or two, but this one is only a few months old. I just tried, last night, to use the 3/8"" (I think it's the 3/8"", I'm angry now so I don't care) and it broke too. This is a junk product, Remington continues to sell it knowing it's junk, so to me that company is worthless. I have much better service and products from companies on Amazon that I've never even heard of. Don't buy this product: I'd give it a negative star if I could."
2,Product did not match my needs,Description induced me in error. I wanted a product for the beard and not hair. Returned the product and replaced it by Model PG360.
1,Terrible,"This is saddest set of clippers I have ever owned. The clippers have no power,when you turn them on you can't even tell they are on. They fell apart the first time I used them, luckily I've had clippers before and knew how to put em back together."
1,they just don't work well,"I admit I haven't used these types of things before but the blades do not cut well at all, the combs are crappy. I am just not happy. So I am returning it in the hopes that I can find one that works better. Even with my little experience"
5,Muy buena!!!,"Silenciosa, casi sin vibración, es una excelente máquina de afeitar para propósitos personales. Lo mejor de todo es que viene que sus accesorios, no necesitas comprar más. Estoy esperando el año que viene para regalarle una a mi padre!!!"
2,Not a good buy,"I ended up here because I was looking for replacement combs like many others. After reading the reviews, I am going to shop for a new clipper instead. My tabs broke on two different combs. And do not believe the maintenance free pitch. I had my son in tears with the first hair cut until I lubricated the cutting blades."
1,Worst pair of clippers I have ever used.,"I have been shaving my own head for almost 20 years now and this is by far the WORST pair of clippers I have ever used.Here are my list of reason why i dislike it so much...1) Ripped hair follicles out of my scalp. The 3-4 times I used this product, my head was left bleeding and sore.2) Huge pain to clean out the clippers themselves.3) Huge pain putting the clippers back together after cleaning. Extremely annoying to align the blades while trying to reassemble.4) The sectioning clips are cheap as could be. Broke one on the second use.You are better off spending a few extra bucks and getting yourself a better quality pair of hair clippers. Avoid at all costs. Would give negative stars if I was allowed.(NOTE: I did not buy these clippers from amazon, but I included 2 pictures to prove I own the razor to back up this negative review.)"
2,weak motor,"The machine cuts but it feels like the motor is too weak to handle the work, I got this machine to save money but now I know that was a serious mistake it's better to dish out the extra 30 or 40 dollars for a machine that can handle the load."
3,Not the best idea...,Bought this on a friend's recommendation. Thought it would be a money-saver (though luckily I am not in a position that I absolutely need to be substituting my haircuts at Great Clips with this). You absolutely need to have huge time on your hands and a patient partner who would agree to do this. It does its job but one needs practice. It saves you money but the time taken to finish the task offsets it.
2,you get what you pay for,"Have you ever seen video clips of the military barbers shaving heads in few a few sweeps? well using this clippers is the exact opposite. After cutting into about an inch of hair, it stops cutting. If you go to fast you end up pulling your hair out.Hit does work,but just barely. you just have to really take your time, and even after doing as thorough a job as I could, upon close inspection there are still a few stray hairs that escaped the blades.If you are only looking to cut your hair once or twice a year and don't want to spend a lot, then this might be for you. However, I would recommend against it. Spend the money to get a decent clippers, and in the long run you will be better off."
3,I was let down,"The only difference between this and easy mac... the noodles and the green speckles they call broccoli.It filled me up, but didnt really satisfy.. it made me feel like I was 10 again."
4,Good device for preliminary testing,"Small, handy and functioning. Good item for a first check of battery and recharging system. Portable and very clear instructions"
5,Saved my tail,This device has saved my tail more than once. I use it in my Dodge pickup that I use for snow plowing. The snow plow lift mechanism puts a tremendous strain on the alternator and batteries. This thing allows me to monitor the situation and lets me know when to stop using the plow to let the battery recover.
1,Don't waste your money,"This item isn't worth buying! It does not show the correct voltage! I have removed it and reinstalled it and each time the voltage is different. The range is 12.8 to 14.5 volts. I have check the battery voltage with my Greenlee volt meter and it consistently reads 13.8 - 13.9 volts.For some strange reason when I rated it with one star, it automatically jumped to four stars. Will try one star again."
5,Very nice and USEFUL!,A great device to keep up to speed on your current charge. Probably saved my butt on the water a few times.
4,Equus 3721 Battery Monitor - Works Fine,Works as intended. Plug it in and you know your voltage. I use it on a boat to monitor the voltage in my batteries while sitting at anchor. I would recommend to anyone.
5,Works as advertised.,"I needed a way of quickly checking the battery voltage on my sailboat without the need to hard-wire something in. I found this device on Amazon and decided to give it a try. This device is so easy to use, since you simply plug it into a 12v accessory outlet and it provides the current voltage. I think it is a great little tool that should be in any mechanics toolbox."
3,volt meter,"Helps you keep an eye on the electrical system far better that a simple warning light and should give some advance warning of an impending failure of thecharging system if you keep it hooked up and keep an eye on it, especially at startup.But I had to devise a cardboard shim to wedge it in place or it would frequently dislodge itself from the lighter socket."
5,good product,"this product does exactly what I wanted. It is cheap, handy and does not require a technician to install- just plug it into your cigarette lighter.I had alternator and battery problems in the past so I always want to know what is happening with these 2 areas.I can reccommend this product to anyone whose vehicle does not have a built in voltmeter"
4,Nice little item,"I bought this to monitor the battery in my camper. It worksquite well - a good solution for the price. The settings(Red, Yellow, Green) match what I'm looking for pretty closely.It has a single decimal place of accuracy - 2 decimal placeswould have scored it a 5."
5,Simply does what it is suppose to do!,I have a diesel truck that has gone through 4 alternators and 6 batteries in the last 8 years. After the last alternator I wised up and starting looking for a way to monitor this BUT didn't want to put an A pillar of gauges in the cab. I found this read tons of good reviews and bought it. I have used it for a fews months now through the winter and this little gem work like a charm! Probably the best 13 dollars I have spent in my life! Think about it what can you spend 13 dollars on for a car or boat that will save you a towing fee or being stranded. Best money I have ever spent PERIOD! I have bought several to give to family!
5,outstanding voltmeter,I bought two of these to monitor the battery system in my motorhome and another to monitor the batteries in my house that I run my computers off of. I can tell at a glance the state of my batteries.Wish I had bought this a long time ago as it would have prevented both overcharging and undercharging by giving me an active monitor of the battery voltage.Highly recommend.
1,Backlight no longer working,"Try unit out when I first bought it. Everything seem ok. Did not use for a month and then when I try it again, background light no longer works. Only used it once prior to light burning out. Too late to return unit with incurring shipping cost."
5,Large easy to read numbers and backlit LCD display,Fits well in my my cars 12 adapter. Display section swivels 180 degrees for convenient viewing.Large easy to read numbers and backlit LCD display.3 LED Warning lights have 2 modes:one mode for battery (motor off) andone mode for alternator (motoring running). Very useful since you don't need to know the actual voltages for a healthy battery or charging system.ACCURATE. I checked the voltage reading with a professional calibrated voltmeter and it was within 0.01 volts. (Surprised me it was that accurate)Note: the LCD backlight and 1 led is always on and are bright. This may distracting to some people driving at night.Very happy with this unit. I would buy it again and recommend it to a friend.
5,Great product at a good price!,If you are looking for a battery monitor that works simply ( just plug in to your vehicle's cigarette/power outlet ) with very easy to understand light indicators.
5,Twelve volt meter,This handy meter plugs into a cigarette lighter socket or twelve volt power outlet. Lets you know when your battery needs charging. Ideal for autos and RV's. Meter face swivels for easy viewing. Sturdy and well-built.
5,A great Battery Monitor,Have been using this for over a month now and it is simple to use and tell you what you need to know.
4,Equus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitor,"Reasonably priced tool that checks the status of your battery when car is off, and the charging system when the car is running. Works well and can alert you to possible problems (i.e. bad/dead battery, needing a jump start, issues with the alternator or generator, etc.) that you'll want to deal with or at least be aware of before it's too late."
4,Perfect,My old 911 does not have a voltmeter in the instrument panel. With older cars you can never know enough about the health of your system. this monitor is really awesome in that the head folds up and down.Cons: no explanation of what the symbols mean on the display and the website doesn't offer a clue either. Would like if the head swiveled as well. These are minor issues.Bottom Line: a great product that does what it says.
5,Car battery voltage tester,"Very easy to use, it does what is suppose to do, read the voltage in the cars battery. very good product, refined."
4,This Monitor Works Well for me,"I have a 20 year old Nissan truck that has an ""iffy"" alternator. It charges most of the time, but I never knew when unless I actually got out and put a voltmeter on the battery with the motor running.Well, this monitor did the trick, for now all I do is plug it in the cigarette lighter, and voila, I can tell if it's charging. As said, most times it's charging, but now I have the security of knowing if/when it's not, and I don't have to spend over $300 to get a new alternator (at least until this one finally gives up the ghost). The monitor also indicates the battery voltage when the motor is not running (there's a chart that comes with it that tells you what's good and what's not).If you have a suspicious electrical charging system, I highly recommend it."
5,simply works,"I compared the readout against another digital meter, and it was spot on. I have driven with the meter in two cars to get a sense of battery condition. It's easy to read from various angles. I like it a lot."
5,Simple and useful ~,"This device gives a constant, backlit readout of battery voltage, together with color-coded info lights to help the inexperienced figure out whether those readings are good or bad. Sturdy, well-designed, and useful for basic battery and charging-system checking/monitoring."
3,don't know if it's accurate,"I don't know what to make from the information this device provides. I primarily want to know the charge status of my battery. This item consistently gives me a yellow light before engine start, yet the two year old battery will not accept a charge from my home charger, which makes me believe the battery is fully charged. So which one is right?"
2,Inaccurate,"The LCD panel is bright and legible. The LED lights provide a quick overview. The unit correctly identifies the monitoring mode, battery vs. charging. I personally found the 2-decimal place voltage reading unnecessary and distracting while driving.I suspect the voltage reading is not totally accurate; one of my cars has a brand new charging system and battery, 6 months since they were installed and less than 2500 miles in usage, but the battery voltage reading tethers 12.3v. I get the same reading on my other car as well. I hooked up both cars to a battery tender and with the tender in floating mode (indicating the battery is basically fully charged) the voltage reading still doesn't exceed 12.4v and the battery icon shows the batteries about half charged. I believe a few other people have reported a similar problem with the battery icon."
3,"Does it's job well, but not more.","The Equus 3721 battery and charging monitor is sturdy, easy to use, and otherwise nicely made with a lit digital voltmeter screen and three colored led's reporting battery charge and charging system performance. The voltmeter is relatively accurate between 7 and 15 volts and reports battery and charging system performance accurately. My frustration is below 7 volts and above 4 volts the Equus reports essentially 7 volts; below 4 it is dark, reporting nothing. They should advertise it's range as 7 to 15 volts for those of us hoping for something more."
2,Inflated shipping cost,The shipping cost was doubled after I ordered this item. I will not order any products from this vendor again.
2,Problem unit,"I purchasted this unit to use in a small aircraft that has no built in battery monitor.The unit failed within one hour of use.It was too cheap to bother to send back so I took it apart.I found two loose screws holding the circuit board and display in place and a bad solder joint.I repaired the solder joint and tightened the screws and the unit has been working fine ever since.Unless you are an Electronic Engineer like me I would not recomend this unit.Strangely enough, the internal components appeared to be high guality.It was not assembled correctly.It's OK if it works."
1,poor performance,"The light's blink like a Christmas tree, it shows i have a red blinling led while the ignition is off and it is a brand new charged battery. I tested this in three vehicles and got the same result. In the garbage can it goes."
5,Excellent Product to go with Trickle Charger,"I recently purchased a Schumacher underhood 1.5 amp Trickle Charger, this is a great product to work with a unit like that. You can monitor the charging status of the battery as well as the alternator charging the system with the engine running. I verified the accuracy with both my fluke and extech meters. As winter approaches in Illinois it is important to insure my vehicles are at peak performance all winter. I have one vehicle that sits outside in the cold with an elect. battery blanket, block heater, trickle charger and now I can insure all systems are ""go"" with this product plugged in. I am confident I will be able to easily start my truck no matter what winter throws at me.This seems well built and I was so impressed initially that I picked up two more as x-mas gifts."
2,does not work,"worked for two weeks then this thing is saying that i have around 7 volts on my battery that is also not charging. yeah... that was about three months ago and it is sitting in the glove box until i decide what to do with it. if you are not a car person, my car would not crank on 7 volts so this thing is lying."
5,Plug It In To Monitor Your Battery,I now make a major habbit on plugging it in when ever I run my vehicle where ever I go.
5,Equus 3721,Arrived quickly will be given as a gift for Christmas with the battery charger. Thanks for the quick service. Thanks
4,Works good for warning you of a battery going bad,"Installed in my 99 SLK as the battery was going on 4 years plus, yep getting yellow light warning for a week, which then changed to red, tried to re-charge, recondition the battery which put me back to yellow for a week then back to red so had to replace the battery. Now green all the time.Also helped me trouble shoot a battery issue with my 2011 E-350, having battery issues, but as soon as you take the long drive to the dealer the battery tested fine. Took photos of this monitor at start up showing RED and zero battery then went to the dealer - gee a different story now!"
1,poor quality,"When I plug in the first time, the signal light changed from read to green or yellow. I was very confused and wonder whether there is electrical problme of my car. I brouhg my car to two different garage for check up. After several hours of waiting, there is no problme with my car at all. How much can you trust this little cheap but convenient device?"
1,Battery charge monitor,The first one shipped did not work. The second one works in one mode only and not able to check battery charge level when car not running. Too much trouble to send it back again.
4,Equus really works,"I am happy with this product overall. I was lucky that I didn't break the reading screen when I was trying to remove it. Other than that, this meter appears to work well now that I can read it. A good buy for the price ... just be careful getting that film off. I don't know if this is common, but I found it extremely difficult to peel the protective plastic film off of the LCD screen. It's shown in the picture, the 11.6 reading is printed on this film. When I pulled the tab to remove it, only the top half of the film came off ... leaving the printed part attached to the screen."
3,Works well enough but don't use leds,Useful to check voltage without breaking out multimeter. Leds light up when a predetermined voltage has been reached. In the winter my battery is fully charged at 12.5 but this shows yellow. So you can't rely upon the led colors.
2,Does what it says.,"Item does what it says. Easy to use, but sparse on instructs to decipher. You pretty much have to figure out what the read-outs mean on your own."
3,its decent,i bought this to use on my solar system to monitor my batteries and so far it has done a decent job and the 3 led charge lights were more helpful than i thought they would be. its not ideal since it cant be mounted in a console but it will work and the adjustable screen does come in handy.
5,Good product,Is easy to read a good tool to have and know the voltage of the battery. You can move the the lcd screen up and down to view it better .
1,Defective/Does not work properly,I tried to plug it into two cars. It did not work and could not able to check battery charge level when cars not running. 13.68 on the screen all the time. I'll do some research to buy a different one.
5,Best for the job,"I have one of these that I use in one of my older cars. Works great. I had gotten it at Wal-Mart. Fast forward, I wanted to get another, so I went to Wal-Mart to try to pick one up. They didnt have it, just a store brand unit. Wow, what a piece of junk. LCD was poor, would flicker because the refresh rate was not right, had one less decimal place to look at, etc. It was a complete disappointment, considering that at Wal-Mart prices, it was $1.50 higher than the Equus here at Amazon. I returned it and was super-glad that I could find this one here on Amazon. I have it in service and it is absolutely great. It works well, works correctly and is accurate. It has two units past the decimal place, not just one (the picture shows 12.6 as the reading but it would actually give you 12.63, as an example).This is the unit to get, you cannot go wrong. My only desire for improvement would be if the color of the LCD could be varied from just green to maybe red as well."
3,Lacks substance,"This video is directed at the young, beginning dancer. It covers very little information, very few steps. A young dancer might be interested to see other young dancers executing steps that they also know, but it is unlikely that they will learn anything a half-way decent, low level ballet class would offer. It also cannot replace a class. It is not a do-along format. Compared to many other dance videos, this video lacks substance. I was disappointed, but again, a young dancer (maybe 6-12 yrs. old) might enjoy its simplicity. (I prefer David Howard's videos)."
2,need more songs for your money,do not have much song for the money you pay .we sang in churches we do need good music .we do not get pay for this
4,clever animals,"this is one of those young children's books where all the characters are animalsand they talk and behave like humans-wear clothes,use furniture,etc.this story is about the animal inhabitants of the ""night woods"" and a gang(led bya weasel)robbing banks and a mysterious ""cloud"" which appears during each robbery.no one seems to know WHAT is this cloud??? is there danger ahead???young children( about three to eight years) would really like this i think.it has some nice drawings of the animal characters by cyndy szekeres."
1,Born Again Christian Preaching,"If you are not a ""born again"" Christian, you will derive no useful instruction from this text."
4,A different read,"There are two ways one might approach the Fragility of Goodness. One might approach the text in search of careful exegesis of classical texts. If this is one's aim, one will probably be disappointed with what Nussbaum provides in this book. On the other hand, one might approach the text in search of a thought-provoking discussion of important issues in moral and political philosophy. If the latter is one's concern, then Nussbaum's work is rich, exciting and well worth reading."
1,Nussbaum the sloppy,"I agree with the reviewer who finds Nussbaum a careless reader. I have found in almost everything of hers I have read that she tends to base long, intricate arguments on small parts of what someone says--parts that aren't representative of their larger point--and distorts and misrepresents those she writes about. She does this whether writing about an ancient author or a contemporary. How she can do this over and over--and do so in high-profile forums--yet retain her great reputation is beyond me. (Come to think of it, shouldn't those who publish her writings have learned by now that they need an army of editors to fix her work?) Those who like comforting platitudes and the veneer of learnedness and scholarship should enjoy her books, but anyone who wants arguments to be sound and to be on sound foundations should be dumbfounded and distressed that someone like her can be so respected in academia."
2,Not that Useful,"I bought this book for evaluating scrubbers in the field. It was not that useful.If this review was helpful, please add your vote -- Thanks."
5,Excellent multifunction printer/copier/scan/fax machine.,We purchased Brother's MFC-8860DN about a month+ ago. Our office staff has been using it mostly for copying and printing. The duplex print feature (which we use a lot) works flawlessly. While shopping for this machine we had read negative reviews specific to it's single page (manual feed) function - for envelopes and label printing. We were pleased to find that the manual feed for label/envelope printing worked flawlessly -the negative reviews were inaccurate. This is an excellent product and the price is very reasonable.
2,Poor quality,"We purchased two of these multifunction machines for two separate offices. While the brother has many capabilities, including SCAN-to-Email, file and PDF. Quality problems greatly hender its performance.Scanning documents through the document feeder result in crooked/offset images. I thought we simply purchased a bad-unit. But, after returning it for a replacement - we got the same result.The first unit we purchased broken down after about 2 months. It just started making this really loud clunking sound. Then it just complained with error messages and wouldn't print.There was a problem with the included software, which caused Scans to fail with error code. The only way to get a fix for this problem is to call technical support. There is no information on the error on their web site.I love the feature set of this product - but the quality is poor."
1,We Tried 2 machines - both died quickly.,"We bought two of these machines for our small 3 person office. Each one used a lot of toner and the drums on each machine died after only a few thousand pages. The worst part - changing the drum DID NOT CURE THE ERROR. That's correct, after changing the toner and drum with OEM Brother parts the machine still reads Drum near end of life.... no help from Brother tech support. I'd like to take them both to the top of my building and throw them off David Letterman style."
3,Brother MFC-8860dn,"It has some very nice features. For example, it prints relatively fast. However, during the paper feeding process the pages would curl a bit so they did not lay flat; thus, hit each other in the output tray and become out of order, and sometimes fly onto the floor. That was a big problem. The printer is abnormally very very loud!! Further, the fax tray did not catch the pages well. Nevertheless, for the money the duplex printing (which I did not try) is a good feature, but likely curls the pages so they would not lay flat."
1,BROKEN!,"The printer was a breeze to set up, easy to use and seemed really reliable. After six months it is BROKEN. The automatic sheet feeder jammed, the jam would not clear, and this completely negated the ability to use the machine as a scanner, copier or fax. Calling Customer Service is a joke! They are in Dominican Republic, speak English with difficulty. They speak from a script which they do not deviate from. And the result is that the product cannot be fixed unless I can transport the 80 lb printer myself (I am a 57 year old woman). There is no provision to have the printer picked up. Because they asked me to repeat steps I had already repeated SEVERAL times, the paper ultimately stuck in the machine and the entire machine is now broken.The printer is useless to me now. I've already bought a replacement. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,Drives me CRAZY!,"We purchased several Brother multifunction and printers. The problem is in the paper feeder. Every time we need to put paper in, it clicks and beeps and then shows ""PAPER JAM"" it takes several times to open and close tray before the unit will function. Buy something else."
1,Slow shipping,I would love to give a review on this printer but it's been 3 days since I placed my order and it hasn't left their warehouse. I feel this is unacceptable for an item that's in stock so I will never buy from Amazon again.
5,Brother MFC 8860,So far so good! We've used Brother products for a while with great results. This unit sets up easily & works great with our network. The duplex is great & saves tons of paper!
5,Great network printer/scanner,"Prior to buying this machine, I bought a Canon multifunction printer which was supposed to work with an Axis print server. To my disappointment, there were all sorts of problems and I would end up having to check on the print server every time I wanted to print or scan something.Unlike the Canon, this machine has worked perfectly. I am able to scan and print from all 9 computers on my network without ever having issues. This is a great printer for anyone on a small network with moderate printing and scanning needs."
1,Poor quality ink,"This printer works well except for one major problem - Brother ink does not adhere to the paper. I use good quality stationery in my business and found that the ink smudged and rubbed off, particularly on envelopes. The problem is not too bad with regular white copy paper, but if you plan to use good stationery, don't buy a Brother printer!"
2,"Good printer, but MANGLES envelopes","I was really happy with the speed and quality of the printer until I tried to print an envelope. This printer does not have a straight-through output path for envelopes. Instead, they have to make a sharp turn inside the machine, which severely creases them, to the point of interfering with the printing.Take a look at the diagram of envelopes they don't support on page 15 of the manual, and you'll see a picture of every conceivable type of envelope. Bottom line: they don't support any, but aren't willing to admit it.I would be embarassed to send my letters out in envelopes looking like this. I returned the unit and got an HP 3390, which does envelopes perfectly. It's otherwise pretty much the same, but $250 more."
1,BUYER BEWARE - additional cost of use,"After using this machine for 5 months, REPLACE FUSER comes up on screen.Check the manual, no word on what this means.Go to ""Brother store"" on web, not for sale.Call Brother support, learn that fuser is to be replaced after 100,000 copies. Guess what. You need to have a technician do it. They can recommend someone.Cost of fuser? $225.57.Cost of technician? Your guess is as good as mine. Assuming $150.00, now we are paying $375.00/100,000 pages that nobody warned us about.I had estimated 0.5 cents/page based upon the toner and drum costs.Now we're at .875 cents/page.I am writing to Brother's CEO/President, PC Magazine, PC World to get this out. I'm furious. And I'm going to see if Staples wants it back based upon bad info at time os sale.And no, the fuser is not under warranty."
5,slightly tart and delicious,"love this mix, as well..they are absolutely delicious and taste like ""from scratch""..my minor adjustments are that i grate the skin of one lemon into the mix and i use 1% milk, rather than water..i also bake the crust for about 8 minutes, then brush melted butter across the top, and continue baking for 4 more minutes, until it starts browning..makes a crispier and buttery crust."
5,Music like a wonderful dinner.,"This album is my no.1 music album. After I listened this CD, I felt myself full of music. If you have experience of taking wonderful dinner at very good restrent with good person, this is the same feeling. It is fussion music, excelent harmony of western and estern classical music. Very classical and very modern."
4,"Not a gripping read, but useful as a reference","This study is not a gripping read, but useful as a reference. The narrative is thorough but dry, lots of charts and graphs, political voting patterns etc."
5,"After One Year, Still Going Strong","I purchased this screen early last year for use in our ""family room"". It is a multipurpose room, so for movie nights, we needed something that could easily be put up, then taken down and stored out of sight. For our purposes, it works great. I wish I had room for a larger screen, but with the roof angle and other items in the room, it is about as big as we can go.So far we have not run into any sags or waves in the screen at the edges, but it does move a bit during movies if we have the overhead fan turned up too high.It gives a great bright picture. We are using it with a Viewsonic Pro 8100 front projector running 1080p and at an 8' viewing distance."
5,A Must Have if you study Haitian Culture!,"Great info, a more objective point of view compared to older studies, well organized book with index (not always available in old texts), necessary for studying."
4,She's The Only Bargain I've Got,I enjoy this 2 cd set tremendously. She has a sweet soprano voice & looks to match.
2,"Pretty good, I guess","This video is excellent for anybody who dosen't have any of the videos in the cartoon classics series, but if you're like me, and you have all of them, this video is sort of a waste of money. ""Society Dog Show"" can be found on starring Pluto and fifi, ""Donald's Double Trouble"" on Starring Donald and Daisy, and ""The Brave Little Tailor"" can be found on volume 6, Starring Mickey and Minnie. Where as in ""Sweethart Stories"", and ""Love Tales"", There is not even one cartoon that can be found on a cartoon classic. If you Don't have any Cartoon classics, buy it! if you have all these cartoons, please, save your money. (p.s If you have time later on, please check out Sweethart stories, Love tales, and the cartoon classics)."
2,"Good bearings, but no support!","I purchased these bearings for my daughter's upcoming competition based on reviews. She skated on these bearings twice when I noticed that one wheel would only spin about 1/2 rotation, stop, and spin slightly in the reverse direction. I removed the bearings and cleaned them according to the manufacturer's directions. After reinstalling the bearings, there was no improvement. I have emailed Bones twice directly with no response. My daughter was unable to use these new, expensive bearings in her latest competition. I am thoroughly disappointed with this purchase."
3,An interesting selection of classic puzzles,"This book provides an interesting selection of classic puzzles. The introduction is very long winded, but has a few interesting bits in it. The author then uses the Canterbury Tales to introduce a puzzle for each character. This is followed by several further chapters of puzzles.The puzzles vary from word puzzles to ones requiring pen and paper - and few that require other materials, such as the cheese puzzle.While the presentation of the puzzles is clearly dated, they still provide some good intellectual challenge."
1,Kindle edition is worthless,The Kindle edition doesn't have the diagrams. A great many of the puzzles are meaningless without the diagrams. I'd give this zero stars if that were an option.
4,A solid - if slim - IT trade journal,"There are few printed periodicals I regularly read anymore andNetwork Worldis on that short list. Both working and aspiring IT professionals can benefit from the industry analysis, technology reviews, and editorials found in every issue. Like most magazines these days, there is almost a 50-50 split between content and ads, but that is a sad fact of life for print media in the Internet age. Still, techs and sysadmins should find both the articles and the advertisements worth reading."
5,Amazing!,"I recently received my copy of Schwarz-Stein's ""New Vogue Children"" album, and I love it! I've been listening to it for the past few days. It's a very good first album for this band. Kaya (vocalist) has a very unique, dark voice which is used at his fullest potential, and Hora on the synthesizer is unbelievable. ""New Vogue Children"" is a MUST HAVE for Japanese rock fans. It's magnificent!"
4,Great set!,"This set is very nice. The stroller is well made, with metal legs instead of plastic. The one hand fold and steering are great. The car seat is easy to snap in and out of the base. We like the more ergonomic handle for carrying the car seat (most car seats have straight handles). In addition, you can buy extra bases to keep in different cars.There are a couple of drawbacks: The fabric, although super cute, is a little rough. Not a huge problem because we use soft blankets around our baby anyway. The car seat base is very stable when put in with the clips. It tends to shift when attached to the car with just the seatbelt.Overall, I would buy this again."
5,We love this stroller/car seat!,"We had a much more expensive stroller and car seat combo and it wasn't nearly as good as this one. It collapses easily, turns sharply, has a place for wipes and they even give you a free sample. The car seat clicks in really fast to both the base and the stroller. I have carpal tunnel and it doesn't hurt to carry my daughter because of the direction they have the handle. My son who is 3 and a half and is a really big boy width, and length wise can fit into the stroller comfortably. There aren't many regular strollers that he can fit into, but this one is that roomy. The only thing my hubby doesn't like is when it sits in the stroller he thinks it sits up right to much. He feels it should be tilted back more like when it sits in the base."
3,disappointed by the fabric,The Aura select is easy to assemble and was ready to go in twenty minutes after opening the box. the big disappointment though was the fabric (it was coarse/non-soft). One would have thought all the different colors in the aura select range would be made of the same type of fabric.. however it turns out the black is the only color with the softer fabric.. we were deceived into thinking that the lower price on the pink was only a factor of the color and not the fabric... a difference of [...] bucks.. in hind sight .. maybe I shud have gone for the black.. may be the manufacturers can clarify this when they post product info..hence the three stars.. so far the travel system has performed within normal parameters
5,Wonderful item,Bought this set-up for our new Grandbaby !! Her parents absolutly LOVE it !!!! Nurses at the hosppital said it is one of the best to take new baby home in.
3,An adequate travel system.,"This is a perfectly fine travel system. There is nothing really special about it, but nothing really wrong with it either. Unfortunately, the stroller didn't fit in our car, so we ended up using a Snap & Go with the carseat. We did use the stroller around town and it is pretty nice, except the steering is really clunky. It is really hard to turn the stroller at slow speeds or from a full stop, you have to back up and kind of get a bit of a running start.I don't really recommend or not recommend this one, it is totally average and adequate."
3,Good but not great.,I really liked this but like all travel system strollers it was pretty big the canopy on the stroller and carseat were irritating the wouldnt stay down and were not big enough. i didnt like the fabric it was like outside furniture material.... but those are the cons other than all that it was pretty good no other problems with it.
4,Great system at a great price!,"My husband and I decided on this travel system for our baby boy. Once he finished putting it all together it looked great. We even went and tried the car seat in our explorer and it fits great, since it comes with the base that is one less thing we have to worry about. The functions the stroller has are great. We are still waiting for out baby to arrive but I am sure he will have a blast in this travel system."
2,Nice picture,"The car seat is good, resistant and relatively light. But the stroller is just too big and heavy for travel. It occupies most of my Mazda6 trunk (And it is a really big trunk). The seat reclines much less than the publicity says, this makes relatively unconfortable for the baby to take a nap. I used to have another from Combi, which reclined completely horizontal. It was much better, lighter and cost almost the same."
2,Deceptive,"One of a number of books by Lobsang Rampa about his life as a monk in Tibet. More famous for ""The Third Eye"". These books have done a great deal in the West to create a the image of the mystical and supernatural powers to the Tibetan Buddhists. Apparently however, Rampa was actually born in Britan as Cyril Henry Hoskin, and was the son of a plumber who had never been to Tibet, whose real identity was uncovered by a private detective several books later. Take it with a grain of salt, and you may just be pleasantly shocked at how much you thought you knew about Tibet that actually came from this man."
2,Fell apart,Was comfortable for a few months and then soles seperated and they became very uncomfortable. Would not buy another pair.
4,A good and practical textbook,It is a very good textbook of critical care medicine.It is simple and precise.
3,Ambient Freeform Accordion,"As a career musician, one can't really make a worse career move than to make experimental accordion music. Track two is the most accessible bit here, and even that borders on severe weirditude. Personally, I like it a lot. Unless you have as high a tolerance as I for accordion abuse, you will think quite the opposite."
5,NICE!,"this card is great... heres the pros...] Small size (Makes for good air flow and makes it perfect for small pcs)] Compatability... Works with anything from DOS and Win 3 to 95,98,NT,XP and even LINUX...] Price very cheap] nice speed] typically plug-n-playCons...] the only con is there is none..."
5,Great Value,I used this to hook up a 1998 vintage Compaq Presario to a home network using a Siemens SpeedStream 5-Port 10/100 Ethernet Switch (SS2105). Installing the card does require opening your computer case but is quite straightforward. The card comes with software but Windows XP automatically detected the card and the Windows XP network configuration wizard did everything else.I had the network up an running in minutes. Overall a great experience and the price is incredible.
2,What were they thinking?,"How could you not put ""Superbad Superslick"" on this comp? I bought it for ""Spank"" and ""Body Heat"" and nothing else! No wonder it's no longer available! True fans of JB know he'd seen better days, but it seems as though they picked the worse stuff they could find! You'd be hard pressed to find two CD's of material during this period, but some record company geniuses scooped up anything (but the right stuff) and slapped it on TWO discs, no less!!!"
3,Not what I was expecting,I love the concept. Moving for healing - different rhythms tapping into different levels of this. However - it was much too slow for me. Please note - I like to use boxing drills for exercise.
2,"Although my colleague loved it, I didn't!","We presented two reviews of this book at All About Romance. I gave it a D, my colleague gave it an A-. For me, there were far too many secrets to be revealed, each at an excruiatingly slow pace. Reading it was like receiving the Chinese Water Torture.This is a story of the reuinion of a couple who split up a dozen years in the past. While such a story could be poignant, this one failed because the split did not seem realistic. If you were newly married and struck by tragedy and your mate said, in a fit of sadness and anger that they never wanted to see you again, would you just leave - like that? I don't think so!Finally, though this author is known for her humor, many of the attempts in this book were annoying rather than funny."
2,Just did not keep my interest,"This book had way too many secrets that were revealed at such a slow pace that I just plain lost interest after a while. I got so tired of reading ""I can't tell him now"", and ""I can't tell him now because he will leave me again"", or ""now isn't the right time"", and ""he won't love me if I tell him"". Eventually I just skimmed ahead and read the ""secrets"" and they were exactly what I had predicted they would be. About 2/3 into the book I just gave up reading every page and skimmed the rest of the story. Even skimming the book the story just went on and on and on. Why do authors think that their readers want to be tortured when reading a love story. Sure we want the couple to have to get through some obstacles before they find love, but we don't want the entire book to be filled with them. It just gets tedious. boring and repetitive."
3,"Intriguing Story, But Very Poor Editing!","I really enjoyed the storyline, but the quality of the editing was truly surprising. The misspellings, auto-spell-check word substitutions (""feet"" where it should have said ""fact"" 3 different times), and grammatical errors were extremely distracting. These are all problems that should have been easily avoided with any sort of attentive editing."
5,Gets Better As You Read,"I don't usually read romance but because it was free on my kindle I thought, ""why not?"". It was quite enjoyable. Not as predictable as I expected and got better the more I read. There were even some laughs along the way. I have to ask however,,,,,who types these free books. They are full of mistakes. Are they hiring? I can do better than that and I type with three fingers."
2,stock romance,"This book does not have one laugh out loud moment or even a smile. Not going into depth, it's rather boring."
4,Good non-academic brief survey,"This is not a deep treatment of half of the species during the later 19th century, but while superficial, it's interesting, well written, and very well illustrated, mostly with reproductions of English ""story paintings"" of the period, heavy on Hunt, Millais, Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Crowe, and Sargent. The coverage runs from Victoria herself, who set the tone, and the myth vs. reality of the world of women at the time, to pioneering women in sport, education, the professions, and foreign travel. A nice afternoon's browse."
4,"Great story, but...","...with lashings of xenophobia, anti-semitism and gory genocidal violence. For anyone who wants to understand the ultimately self-destructive aspects of a certain type of Russian psyche, this is the story to read. The free kindle edition is fine."
3,Not as good as the Buddha Bar series,"I recently discovered that George V records had created another spin-off of the Buddha Bar series with Buddhattitude. Unlike the Buddha Bar compilations, Buddhattitude consists of one cd with original music, not a diverse mix of songs by various artists. The cd I just discovered is the Liberdade cd. As a long time fan of the Buddha Bar series, I have to say that this new spin-off is rather disappointing. I rather found this cd a bit dull although it is relaxing to listen to after a hard day at the office. The music is a mix of new age, Latin, and a hint of Parisian. What I liked about the Buddha Bar cds was the Asian influences that permeated in the music. LIBERDADE didn't have a whole lot of spark and is rather dull. What a shame coming from my favorite chill out series."
4,Shut the Box,"Fun game, great for adults and kids (learning addition), classy look though built very flimsy. Dots on dice are hard to read and not contructed very well."
5,"Can't find my copy, so it's on the wishlist","Dad and I had a copy, and I can no longer find the copy (might have gotten lost in shutting down his house), so it's back on the wishlist. Ever look at a square rigger and wonder ""what did/do all of those lines do?"" This book will tell you. The chapter on working a tideway alone is amazing"
1,Give me a break!,Political correctness has really gone too far. Why can't Disney stick with the characters and stories created by A.A. Milne?
4,La Divina Comedia,I really liked the music that interpreted the great Divine Comedy. I wish there would have been more of it.
2,Yuck!,There are not many makeovers in the book and they are all pretty eccentric. I suggest staying with Design on a Dime.
1,Tacky,"I did not care for this book. Shower curtains (with plastic) as window coverings? Uh, no thanks. I understand only having $500. I think you'd be better off getting used furniture and saving your money until you can afford better."
5,Inspiring! Only drawback is it's too short!,"Lisa Quinn offers real life, wonderfully creative ideas and tips for budget challenged decorating in this book. Divided into four categories (dramatic, classic, exotic, children's)with four to six example rooms per category, Quinn provides multiple pages of details and photographs for each room. There are tons of ideas & easy how-to projects here & Quinn's witty approach has you laughing. Although I've read it several times now, I still reference it, not only for budget conscious ideas but also for general inspiration on color schemes & design styles. It's become an unexpected but welcome addition to my all-around decorating library. My only complaint is that it's just not long enough! Quinn's design and writing style are so enjoyable, you want more...hopefully there's a sequel in the works!"
1,Too funky for me,"I may be too hard on the book; it has color pictures, before-and-after, and explicit instructions and those are all good things. I just didn't like her style. Even the ""classic rooms"" section was unattractive to me, much less the surfer room, the moroccan room, the red bordello room. And the great deals she got on some of her items can be replicated only in a big city, not in the country where I live, without consignment stores and clearance sales at design centers. So I was disappointed."
1,Paid and never received. Only got 1 star because wouldn't let me send this.,"We have never received the product. The frustrating thing is no where to turn to for help. I emailed the seller with no success. Tried to contact Amazon, no success there either. So, I contacted American Express since it was charged on their card and they are investigating. So, it may well be the last time we order from Amazon. Bad experience."
5,Excellent thesis on McDonaldization's impact on society,"Ritzer analyzes the way McDonaldized systems work to increase efficiency while lowering quality, how we accept bland homogeneity for the sake of convenience while stifling diversity. An outstanding book of sociology, written with uncommon grace and humor."
5,A book everyone should read,"George Ritzer's book on McDonaldisation of society makes fantastic reading, while being loaded with sociological observations. It is absolutely impossible not to stop to rethink our modern attitudes towards the easy way of life, after having read it. It is essential that we realise the extent of manipulation we undergo in our everyday life. Moreover, Ritzer's book is especially valuable to the countries of the former Communist block,where whatever is American is considered pefrect and undergoes the process of idealisation. Perhaps Ritzer's observations will save some of the readers from the life in the cage, which is created by McDonald's and its offspring."
2,The opinion of mathematican,"I must confess I am the mathematican and I started to learn from this book. But my questions to you, experts of C. M., arise:i) Is it good to speak about strech tensor and avoid using polar decomposition?ii) Is it worth to describe and compute spectral decomposition in 3D case in details while speaking about principal stresses? And assume that the modern student of engineering doesn't know this part of linear algebra?I couldn't do most of excesirses at the end of the chapter after reading it, so it was not good self-study book, at least for me. It tasted like old-fashioned book."
4,"LNS4692D Samsung 46""LCD TV","The picture is exellent, dependent upon your service provider. HD over air signals produce crystal clear images. The sound is adequate. System adjustments are simple, remote function is, as well. The unit generates a considerable amount of heat which is welcome in the winter, not so much in the summer. Cooling slots on the bottom discourage placing the unit on a solid surface. The unit arrived attached to the swivel stand. This stand utilizes a metal plate on the bottom. When swiveling the tv, burrs or protrusions on this plate caused scratches on whatever surface it was placed. It was a simple fix by using sandpaper to remove the burrs, but caused scratches on the floor when the unit was unpacked. Quite annoying. Also, finding an acceptable wall mount proved to be very difficult. Nevertheless, it is an awesome television with incredible color and sharpness."
1,Didn't work out of the box,"Connected the TV which would stay on for a max of 5 min then would turn itself off. I called Samsung to schedule service and it took them a week to come out and see the TV. I still don't have the TV back... Once it works, I might review this differently but extremely disappointed."
1,No Picture after 18 Months,"I bought my TV and was very pleased with it until this week when the picture stopped working after owning it for only 18 months. The sound will come through, but there is no image. The product comes with a 1 year warranty, and I didn't buy an extended warranty. However, I did expect for the TV to work for more than 18 months.Additionally, in looking through my paperwork, I realized why the price was better from Amazon than from local electronics stores. The TV is from Canada and not from the US.Needless to say, I am disappointed in the performance of my Samsung TV."
2,Great at first but the screen cracked without warning!,"I bought this TV 2 years ago from another store (their initials are BB) and was very happy with the picture and sound. Last week I had to take the TV off my wall to hook up another HDMI for my Blu-Ray player. When I turned the TV back on the screen was cracked and the picture was out. I have a 4 year extended warranty with ""BB,"" but they told me that the warranty doesn't cover cracked screens. I now have a $2200 paperweight.Bottom line: The TV has a great picture but is obviously very fragile. DO NOT get an extended warranty from BB. This and probably most any other ""extended"" warranty will only cover very technical problems, not easily cracked screens."
5,Great TV,"This is a great TV, with super HD quality. The regular TV picture is not great but it's hard to tell how much of that is just the difference from the HDTV. You get spoiled pretty fast. Still, I did a lot of comparing and am happy with this purchase."
5,Excellent choice,"This TV is great. Ranked high in consumer reports. The HD picture is outstanding. The standard def picture is OK, nothing special. It has all the hookups in the back I need. The swivel stand is key and I'm using it daily. The shiny black boarder is slick looking. I originally thought it might be distracting, but not at all. Shipping was fine. Good price on Amazon...hundreds less then circuit city!"
3,black screens .........aweful........someone help,"I bought the 92D after 3 months of continuous research, and of course taking the reviews into consideration. Here is my problem. When black screens come up, the screen is full of green and red pixels, when it changes back to a brighter screen no problem. The HD channels also do this but not nearly as bad. My provider is Direct TV. Also, on dvds with my sony DVPNS75H upconversion the picture is perfect, no problem there. I called direct tv. and told them about the red and green pixels floating on the black screens, they seem to think it is the tv. They are shipping me a new HD receiver to see if this corrects this. Is anyone else having this problem ? Or does anyone have any suggestions? I hope i dont have to return this beutiful set."
1,Buyer Beware # 2,"We bought this on January 13th. The picture died on April 27th. We contacted Samsung Customer Care who directed me to the Service Engineer assinged to our area. He could not schedule the repair visit until Samsung authorized the "" extra mileage"". So we carted an old TV in from the garage, ( It weighs a ton) and have it setting in front of the Samsung. Service visit scheduling should be approved "" some time soon"" according to Samsung customer care. If it were not a $ 2000.00 machine, I would take it out in the drive way and run over it and ship it to Samsung collect. I feel like the Clampitts here with two TV's setting in the family room."
1,15 months-2600.00 dollars later-Samsung doesnt care,"We purchased this tv 15 months ago. My husband fell in love with it until 3 weeks ago. Tv picture went out but the sound was still there. We didnt purchase the extended warrenty. We contacted samsung and they really dont care. Finally we had a service rep come out for 200.00 but he only charged us 100.00. He told us that our T con board was broke and it would be 1200.00 dollars to repair. He then continued to tell us that that they didn't make the t con board for this TV anymore, so basically we should get a new tv or something comparable from samsung. Samsung has given us the run around. I am very disgusted with there service. I will never buy a samsung again. Oh and by the way we threatend to go to our tv channels for help and report samsung and tuesday they are coming to repair our tv. Oh they found the part."
1,Predator - Concrete Crap,"This is, by far, one of the worst games I've ever played. For one, there's no excuse for the sorry graphics on a PS2. They would've been acceptable on the first Playstation, but its downright terrible. The camera angles are not your friend. Everything else about this game is just stupid.But what do I know? I only played it for five minutes before I quit because I couldn't take it anymore. I drove all the way back to the video store and returned it within a half hour of renting it. Even if I didn't have the car, I would've walked the two miles just to get it out of my house. That's how bad this game sucks."
5,ARE YOU PEOPLE CRAZY!?!?!? THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!!,i'm a huge pred fan and an alien fan. the camra is 1 of the camra styles i have ever got 2 use. 5 stars. graphics coud have ben a little better but overall thay are good.4 1/2 stars. ther is a lot of cussing but there a lot of cool sfx. sound 4 stars.gameplay. it rocks it gets better when you get your first skull game. gameplay gets 5 stars.over all a 5 star game get it o and for the record i'm a hard core gamer and i love it get it it rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Predator Concrete Jungle rocks, you guys are oout of your mind!","You guys must be joking. This game rules. I admit the graphics are very cheesy, but hey, graphics aren'y everything! Most of the attacks are pretty funny, but after the first few times they lose that sense. But they are still cool. The weopons are very cool. It has a better ""hunting experiance"" than my favorite PC game Aliens versus Predator 2: Gold Edition. It is fun, but the predator in first-person was kind of weird. However, Predator Concrete Jungle has a combination of third-person AND first-person is simply awesome. This game is worth the [...] I payed for it. The cloaking field generator and different visual spectrums are beyond those of Aliens versus Predator 2: Gold Edition. THIS GAME IS WORTH BUYING BY FAAARRR!!!!!"
4,a great game,"Predator Concrete Jungle is about a predator who hasto redeem himself because of failing a mission. The predatorhas many different weapons he can use to help redeem himself.Examples are: plasmacaster,a cloaking device, and a smart disc.He can also use many different vision modes to helphim in his quest. The thermal vision mode detectsheat, while the Neuro Vision mode is tuned in by human activity. ThePredator is very detailed in the way he looks, while the backgroundand the people he fights are bland. The only thing I didnt likeabout the game was the strong language. Thats why I hadto minus a star. You even get to fight the aliens at the end of the game.The game is very violent.The predator decapitates his enemiesheads, slits throats,pulls out their skulls, cuts them in half,pops their head like a water balloon being squeezed,and rips their body apart. Besides all thatit is a pretty fun game."
2,"Lame, could and should have been better","The idea of playing as the modern day classic movie monster the Predator in a sprawling urban landscape is enough to entice any gamer into playing Predator: Concrete Jungle, whether they be a fan of the character or not. However, as promising as this game may appear, it is sadly disappointing. A choppy frame rate, muddy graphics, clumsy controls, and migraine inducing camera angles really ruin what could have been a great gaming experience, and the usage of the Predator's various abilities doesn't go as well as one might hope. Not to mention that once upon completion, there is practically no replay value whatsoever, and the game's story doesn't delve into the Predator mythology as much as it proclaims to. All in all, for Predator fans this game is worth a rental at best, but for the rest of us this is better left on the shelf."
4,For parents,"This game is very violent and gorey so if your worried about that kind of stuff, dont get it and if you dont trust me, heres some examples, you can skin people and hang them up by their ankles, skull people, chop them in half and etc. but if you don't mind that kind of stuff, get it because its pretty fun."
3,Something so cool turned into something so cruel,"To make this quick, I will use a rating scale.Graphics: 3/5Sound: 4/5Voiceovers: 1/5 (It's so funny at first how lame the voices are, then it gets boring)Controls: 4/5Gameplay: 3/5Overall: 3/5"
3,Not bad,I'm rating this three stars because I don't personally care for the game itself. The service and shipping from Amazon were just fine. Just not a huge fan of the game...
4,Nice to have extras around,Can never find an empty cassette when I want to record choir practice. That's why it's good to have some around.
1,post-Dumas rubbish,"This is a good example of the sort of rubbish that was written about Louis XIII and Richelieu in the 19th century (and which, sadly, survives in some quarters today). The picture painted is poor-poor-Marie, weak-cowardly-Louis, evil-crafty-Richelieu. It has no grasp of the personalities, let alone the major political issues, involved. In fact it has no bearing on reality. I wouldn't recommend this three-volume waste of paper to anybody."
1,HORRIBLE,"I wouldn't even give this book a star if I had the option. The fact is, not only is this book harldy helpful, but it is also obvious upon reading this book that the author must be an uptight, jewish princess who obviously only enjoys Santa Fe and Taos merely because it is the ""in"" thing for snobs to do. She tries to be informative, but is really just dumb. And her picture is god-awful, I feel so terribly sorry for anyone who has ever had to see her in person, let alone date or sleep with her. PLEASE DO NOT GIVE THIS NO TALENT CREATIVE WRITING WANNABE YOUR MONEY"
1,terrible - avoid,constant paper jams. various color inks in different cartridges but they mysteriously must all be replaced simultaneously. hmmm.very bad on screen instrutions. not well made. has not worked for more than a day or two in a row.after months still cant figure out how to use wireless connection.
4,Very good printer for the money,"I purchased this printer because I purchased a HP Officejet 7410 last year and have had many problems with the wireless interface and software. The Brother is less than half the money and works much better than the HP. The paper handling of the Brother is the only weak item. The plastic is cheap and low quality. It works OK, but it is low quality."
1,What a piece of junk!,"After about a year or two of light use and several cartridge changes, I get a No Cartridge Found message. The machine has shut down all printing. I've followed all procedures in the manual and searched the Brother web site in vain. The thing has become an expensive paperweight. Since I bought it on Amazon, I've spent at least $100 in ink cartridges printing only hundreds not thousands of pages.Besides brief cartridge checking and cleaning procedures, Brother only recommends contacting an authorized repair dealer. Right!? Let me spend $100 in addition to all the ink expenses to fix something that probably has no current value.I strongly recommend you look elsewhere before buying this thing. It's not a printer. It's a piece of junk."
5,Amazing small Printer,"Keep It Simple ""aashu"" (NJ, USA) - See all my reviewsI looked around for all the different products out there and somehow decided on this on. There are not many reviews out there but the features of the machine convinced me that this would be a nice choice.With that said, this printer is an amazing machine. I bought it here at Amazon which is cheapest compared to everywhere else.With all the features like, color screen, In built wireless interface, All color functionality, Media card reader, this is a winner. Finish of the product may not be top of the line but it works very well. Setup is easy, wireless setup was a breeze(I used the wep key as well) and setup 2 of my laptops to use the printer. Print speed may be a little slow but didn't bother me.On top of that, it is compact and Ink is soooo cheaper than HP and canon.I would highly recommend it for Home use or a small personal office."
5,Recommend this unit highly,"I shopped and asked everyone I know about these multi function units. The Brother is compact, easy to set up, looks great, and works great.I know several people who bought the HP unit and it eats ink and breaks down. My brother has performed flawlessly. A very nice purchase"
2,Fitzgerald would spit.,"This will become our generation's Great Gatsby? Are you joking? The Great Gatsby is a tragedy, a book about American dreams, it has a moral center, it is deft and brilliantly imagined, no sentence is wasted. This book is a mess--yes some of the writing is really funny, laugh out loud funny, and there are some great lines, but the plot is meandering, the denoument completely unsatisfying, the ending a total bust, and the characters are flat as paper, no could love them, by the end you just want to line them up and slap their faces. For someone who is a magazine editor you would think she could do a better job of cutting this book in half."
1,Garbage,"I saw this piece of trash in the clearance section of a used book store for $2. It isn't worth two cents. I opened the book at random and read a few sentences, and almost vomitted. The writing is horrid. I handed the book to a clerk and asked him to look through it. He had the same reaction. This is possibly the worst book ever written in the English tongue. Appalling. Horrid. Sickeningly inept.Painful. Vapid. Useless. Incompetent. Pointless. Worthless. Grotesque.Nauseating. Pathetic. Ridiculous. Coma-inducing.Mind-numbing. Utterly awful.Sheer torture. Causes cancer.Avoid at all costs. The very sight of it nauseates me. Could be used instead of nuclear weapons."
1,The Coast of Akron,"I approached this book with high hopes, having remembered a New York Times review that praised it as ""hilarious."" It's not. It's not even mildly amusing. It's clumsy, unfunny, and full of characters that remain opaque and unclever throughout -- although I get the feeling that we, the readers, are supposed to find it all too too amusing. Whomever reviewed the book must have been a relative! My advice is, skip it."
3,Cheap reflects in quality,"Quality is marginal. Would not be comfortable for gigging. Nylon is thin and easily tangles... Ends are plasticy. Surprised Fender allows the name to be embroidered on it. I would choose the ernie ball cheap strap over this one, ernie ball seems nicer and is under $5."
5,I felt like a kid again!,"How often do you find a children's Christmas book that is truly entertaining? This one was. The main character, Katie, an inquiring 'tween, is vulnerable, unexpected and funny. After reading about her love of family, her desire to preserve tradition and endless curiosity regarding an eccentric history professor, I wished she could be our next-door neighbor. My own kids couldn't stop talking about Katie or this book. The illustrations were an absolute treat. Anyone that enjoys a good yarn, engaging characters and a dash of holiday magic will love this new, children's classic."
5,Christmas Reminder,This wonderful book will remind us all that there is still Magic in Christmas. It shows us that it is better to give then to receive. You don't have to be a child to enjoy this story. You only need to beleive in the Spirit of Christmas. Winter Spirit will be added to my traditional Christmas reading list.Thank you Gina for the reminder to always believe in the Spirit of Christmas.
2,too expensive for the quality,"I purchased this kitchen cart to add more work space for my small kitchen. Upon opening the package we found that one of the panels had a small tear, some hardware was missing, and there were some minor scratches elsewhere. I am very disappointed with the drawer. It is difficult to open and close. While it is very wide, it isn't very deep, so your average cooking utensils have to be laid at an angle to fit in the drawer. Overall, I am not impressed with this product. I expected higher quality for the price paid."
3,"OK, not great.","This item's manufacturer needs to really work on instructions. The drawer needs some sort of of support other than the frame of the cabinet. All in all, I probably would not choose another item by Winsome Wood when there are so many other options.Shipping was fast."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I agree with the previous reviews. For the price the quality is definitely lacking. I am trying to figure out how to fix the top drawer so that it doesn't take a full minute to open and close. I had to adjust the holes of one of the front panels so it lines up properly. From a distance it looks good and my pots and pans fit inside. If that weren't the case I would have given it a single star only. I was lucky--no missing parts or pieces. The stainless steel top had a slight dent in it but I assembled it to be on the opposite side so it's not visible unless you pull it out. This cart is good if you are on a budget and all you can afford. You might consider taking the same money and buying a used, solid piece for cheaper and paint it."
5,This is the best conditioner on the planet,"I don't know why everyone doesn't know about this stuff. I have been using it on my long blond hair for a minimum of 15 years. I have tried lots of conditioners over the years - aveda, kerastase etc... but in the end I keep coming back to this as my staple. Nothing you will purchase on the drug store shelf comes anywhere close to the conditioning softness you will get from this. They also make a leave in product that is great for softening split ends or smoothing out a bit of frizz that works great. It costs a fortune when you buy it in a salon, and its relatively hard to find (though I started buying it at CVS believe it or not), but thanks to amazon I order a couple liter sized bottles every few months and my hair stays soft and silky despite sun, chlorine, and regular highlights."
4,Great stuff,Does a great job on making my hair look its best. I will order more of this product in the future.
5,very good CD with a lot of differnt kinds of rhythm,"very good songs especially number 1,3,5,6,8, and 10.number 8 is very popular song in Mexico."
1,Textbook material,"I did not find this book useful for what I was working on, but it is full of information about the changes in the places children have to play, in very detailed, textbook like data."
3,wonderfully helpful to learn the language,"This book has been VERY helpful to aid my learning of Lao. Wih my partner being from Laos I had a basic understanding of the language, but my pronunciation left ALOT to be desired. With this book I have been able to improve my understanding of the language to a great degree and found that my pronunciations have improved. I personally found the guide to alot of the Lao sounds most helpful as all Lao speakers I know have difficulty in trying to give an english sound that is similar. To me the best part of this book is how the authors have made it easy to understand. Dont get me wrong, its not perfect in its pronunciations, but with a little aid, and in conjunction with Lao for Beginners : An Introduction to the Spoken and Written Language of Laos by Tatsuo Hoshino, it will certainly allow you to pick up the language quite quickly."
4,"As good as it gets in Lao, but you will need the tapes.","Dr. Yates designed both the Thai and Lao courses of the Foreign Service Institute and was heavily involved in the wonderful Khmer course taught there as well. The other reviewers are certainly correct about how well-organized this Lao course is, and how essential the audio tapes are. As for the writing system, Dr. Yates developed a terrific programmed course on the Lao writing system that was taught in conjunction with this basic course. Students should seek out that 400-500 page book as well as the audio tapes. This material does stand the test of time, but one cannot help but regret how the end of the Southeast Asia conflict brought a great shortfall in funding for course development."
2,Lao without audio,"This course would be good but there is a major spolier. Lao cannot possibly be learned from a book. It is probably about the hardest language in the world to pronounce. Not just the sounds but the tones also. In the original version of this course, the introduction carries a note that the course does not come with tapes because the language does not lend itself to the use of audio material. I cannot work that one out! I have another course in Lao with thre CDs, so it is possible to have audio.If I learned Lao from a book only and went to Laos, I guarantee that nobody would understand one word I said.So, what would be a top-quality course with tapes or CDs is effectively useless."
5,This book is so cute,I just received this program and so far I love it. I especially like where Garcia signs Brand New Day. I wish he signed all of them. I do not have a CD rom but there are many features you can access through the CD Rom so maybe I will find it there. This and Signing Time are my favorites.I am not deaf but am now taking a coarse in signing to teach my children in Korea Enlglish and this is a great way to do it.
5,Doesn't Drive Parents Wacky & Our Son Loves It,"We learned about this cd in a play group. We found our son loves this cd and well the music does not drive us crazy. It is not like some children's cds where it is all about the sing along and well the music suffers. This one takes jazz, reggae, a bit of Elvis, and other music types mixing it with funny children's lyrics. We highly recommend it."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun",My kids love this fun book and DVD. We have fun dancing and signing all around the house. We get great exercise and learn sign language at the same time. I was very impressed with how quickly we all picked-up the signs.
5,"""Don't forget to pick-up your Pick Me Up""","Wow! After purchasing more than 25 videos and CD's for my class, I now have the perfect CD and Activity Book made for teaching songs using ASL signs. I can't say enough about the clarity, usuability, and creative songs on this CD. It has rock-n-roll, hip-hop, country, lullaby, and many more types of music on the CD. PLUS, the Activity Book takes you step by step through each song! You have to see this to believe it! Since I don't teach made-up signs for children, this is a great tool for me to help little ones learn to use ASL signs through the movement of music.Way to go Northlight! I would give this 10 stars if I could!Gwen"
3,"Okay, but not as good as it seemed to be","I liked the concept for this product, but I'm kind of disappointed by the sound of the songs. It seems like they tried to make the songs clever, but for my one year old, they just don't interest him. They are not catchy enough, I think. Listening to the songs and looking at the book have helped me practice different signs, but the songs are fast and even I have had a difficult time staying with the music. I can't imagine my one year getting it anytime soon."
1,Pretty Boring,"I love Catan and Carrassonne, but this game is pretty lame. The instructions are as complicated as the other two games but without the reward of a great game. This game plays very similay to Carrassonne but on a minature gameboard and takes 5 minutes to play. Not too inspired to play several games for sure. Waste of 10 bucks"
3,Decent little 2 player game,"You can play a game of this in 15 minutes or so once you know how to play. It's pretty light, but overall not that bad of a two person experience. I would much rather play this than Skip-Bo or some other trash. Only real complaint is the junky little paper ""followers"". They should have been Meaples."
2,Sophistry,"The unit commitment problem is stated using math formulas which contain 28 symbols. To understand the formulas, it is necessary to memorize the definition of each symbol. If you have the patience, you can translate the formulas into something coherent in about 3 hours. The result is rather straight forward and forms a basis for understanding which, theoretically, is the purpose for which the book was written.For those who are already familiar with the symbols, see the review by the reader from Yonkers."
5,Anthony finds his true Cleopatra!,A must for any music lovers collection. A true Punk/New Wave genius.
1,Chakra Yoga,This tape is NOT a good introduction to Yoga. The instructor's incessant chatter breaks up concentration and the excercises don't flow from one to another.
4,could have left off the second disc,"i think they could have just left off the whole second disc and put New Gold Dream in its entirety instead. Hearing their early stuff, I have refreshed my respect for them: really wonderful, and unique. Hearing their later stuff, bleh, saccharine confirmative smarm that tugs the heartstrings like some dog humping your leg. And that stupid throwaway dance remix at the end adds nothing."
4,Something is Missing,"I got this complilation for my son. When my son and husband were reading the package they both asked ""Where is 'New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84)'""How can a Simple Minds Compilation NOT have that song ?Otherwise, it is a decent collection and a very good price for a 2 disc set."
5,Couldn't ask for more,"This is indeed the best compilation of my all time favorite band Simple Minds. This is a double CD packed with all their hits that you are familiar with in the 80s and 90s.You could not ask for more! From ""Don't you forget about me"" to ""Mandela Day"" each song is a piece of art.Simple Minds rule!A Must!"
2,Beware of edits,"If you like the full versions of these songs, avoid this compilation. Several of them suffer from the ""edit disease."""
4,Atmospheric synth-driven music,"Disc One of this retrospective is more interesting than the second disc which draws on the period from the late 1980s onwards when Simple Minds were losing their edge. My favourites remain the atmospheric eurosynth number I Travel, another early one Life In A Day, the hypnotic Love Song plus the megahits Don't You Forget About Me, Promised You A Miracle and Glittering Prize. Their distinctive sound merged atmospheric synths with a kraftwerk-like beat and were very cinematic and evocative. Unfortunately the decline is all too apparent on the second disc where the synths meander aimlessly amongst the political sloganeering. So if you're a fan, get this for Disc One to have all their greatest hits together."
4,The Best of Simple Minds,"The Best of Simple Minds being the second greatest hits album from Simple Minds and is truly a gem for a child of the 80's. I remember dancing to these tracks back in the 80's and they bring back so many memories for me. Here we get so many amazing tracks, i.e., ""Promised you a miracle"", ""Alive and Kicking"" and the unforgetable ""Don't You (Forget About Me"". The booklet contains no lyrics but does have liner notes written by Billy Sloan. 4/5."
3,Enjoyable but flaw in you cannot Play All,"Very much enjoy the series and my children enjoy watching while we are on long drives in the car, my only criticism would be that the DVD does not have a feature that simply allows you to play all episodes on each disc, once an episode has ended, you have to use your remote control to scroll to the next episode, I was disappointed with that. I bought Seasons 1 & 2 and you can play all episodes. I wish the family well and enjoy this show very much."
5,Jon and Kate Plus Ei8ht,"Jon and Kate plus Eight is my favorite show, I got season 1+2 for christmas and I watch an eposode almost everyday. It is very amusing to see the kids, laugh, screem, and love each other. I think this is a show for all ages and everyone will love it the second they start watching it."
3,Funny but a big big,"They don't make many fishing hats for women so it's hard to find a good fitting hat. This hat is a pretty one and people love the message but the size is a bit bigger than I can wear comfortably, even with the adjustable strap. Also, not the best shade of blue if you have a darker tan."
5,fire pro wrestling,fire pro wrestling is a must have for any wrestling fan good graphics lots of action i highly recomend this game
4,"Once you get used to it, you'll never put it down","When i first heard about this game coming to the gameboy advance i was excited. Then i read some reviews and heard it was awesome. So with the money i saved i bought a gba and fire pro wrestling. At first i was disapointed because the gameplay takes some getting used to. Once you learn how to play though, You will never, eeeeeeeeeeeeeever put it down. This is a definate must-own game. Oh, and dont worry about there not being any real wrestlers in the game, They are all there just re-named. And its extremely easy to figure out who's who."
4,Fire Pro Wrestling,"There are mixed reviews for this game. I believe the bad reviews are due to its learning curve. Timing is everything. At first I was unable to get off any moves, but now I am winning more often. There is not a wrestling license for this game which means that the WWF/WCW stars are not available. However, there are some wrestlers that have very familiar moves. The game includes an edit/create wrestler option, so you can make your changes. Any real wrestling fans will really appreciate this game! I gave it 4 stars because it would have to be perfect to deserve 5. Great lasting appeal, buy it!"
3,"It's good, but it looks like it should be for GBC","Only hard-core fans of pay-per veiw fights will want to go to the mat with Bam!'s graphically overwhelming mix of wrestling, UFC, martial arts, choppy animation and sluggish controls. The brawler boasts tons of muscle-bound moves and over 200 wrestlers,but aside from it's four player battle royale mode FPW looks like it should be for GBC instead of GBA."
2,Not impressed as I thought I would be,"Graphics are pretty straightforward. Gameplay is a bit twitchy. And if you want to play against other players, they must also have the game cartridge."
3,i haven't had it long so i can't really judge...,"I haven't had it long so I can't really judge but, this is what I think of it right now! The graphics are ok, the sound is kinda cheap, ITS A REALLY HARD GAME TO GET USED TOO-the controls hard to get used to let me tell you that right now, its all about timing- a good thing is, there's alot of different things you can do in edit mode. This game will last you along time (most likley) I haven't tryed out the multi-player mode but it looks ok. What it comes down too really is the edit mode cause you can do so much in there make guys, make teams, rename guys, and a lot more... the setup screen before the match is cool you can pick alot of different things but my guess is (well since I haven't had this game long) is that it will be a challenge too get started and it will be fun. I give it a three cause it is fun and it takes awhile to beat."
2,Serious Letdown......,"After playing Tony Hawk 2 for the GBA, I was under the impression that all the Advance games were going to be top-notch. Well, after playing Fire Pro, I learned that impression was completely false.This game is a loser in almost every sense of the word. The graphics are weak...in fact they resemble GBC...ouch. The control is [bad]; I don't understand what the creaters were tying to do with interpolating percentages into a wrestling game. Oh well. Live and learn."
4,one point against,the PIP does not allow to watch one tv channel in the main screen and a different one in the PIP screen
5,quality product,"I purchase most of my electronics based on reviews done by CONSUMER REPORTS. I've had very few disappointments with buys using their test results.This TV was a winner. Excellent picture quality, easy to use remote and decent array of features.Favorably priced against comparable products of the competition."
1,Vexed,"Purchased this TV January 2007. It was fine while it lasted. In July 2008, the picture and sound vanished. The Samsung authorized repairman ordered a circuit board 7/10. It has been 6 weeks and the only response the technician gets from Samsung is ""It's on back order."" I've never had a problem with a TV so quickly. I've never had a repair move so slowly. Samsung customer service is disappointing. And, the repair will be pricey, if it ever happens.Talked to Samsumg Customer Service today, 8/21, and they were attentive. The part is on Nationwide back order. Attentive but they can't do anything about it. Seems this isn't unusual. I thought it was. It should be."
4,Great picture w/ super fast shipping,"I did a lot of research before making this investment and thus far I am VERY pleased with this set. Extremely easy to set up and the picture is amazing....I have not even tapped the HDMI yet and am getting great quality from S-video and component video. Be sure to read all the reviews here, cnet, and circuit city has to offer....they are helpful when trying to choose b/t similar models. There are lost areas in blacks, but you quickly get used to them. I am using cox cable and most channels are very nice, but there are a couple channels with weak reception. Beyond 6-8 feet most everything looks awesome.The item arrived 10 days ahead of schedule despite the fact that I used the free super saver shipping. Very pleased with the service from Amazon and would look here to purchase electronics in the future.Lastly, I just mounted the TV and it looks great on the wall even when turned off. Very nice, modern cabinet makes it easy to disply and it blends into the room."
1,Samsung LCD LN-S4092 Dead pixels,"I did purchase this LCD from Amazon and was happy with the purchase and delivery. However, after a short 18 months of hanging on my wall, my Samsung LCD mysteriously developed a line of dead pixels, top to bottom. Samsung stated that there's nothing they will do with this obvious defect since it's out of warranty. After some internet research, this issue seems to be common for Samsung LCDs. Buyer beware!!![...]"
5,Great product!! Samsung does it again.,"This is a nice HD TV. Blue Ray is awesome and it is easy to use. many great features. Would recommend this TV, no problem."
5,A good TV,"I use this TV mainly for TV viewing so how it functions as a monitor or gaming device isn't something I would know about. It's my first experience with LCD and I actually went to Circuit City to look at in the store.The picture is amazing especially in HD. I've watched Discovery's Planet Earth on it and sometimes you feel like you are in the picture. Regular stations are clearer also but you have to stretch it, if you want full screen. Nothing I can't live with.The best part of LCD is that in a bright room with lots of glare, the picture stands up perfectly. When I first got it, I played a lot with the different types of picture: Dynamic in bright light, Movie at night, etc. but eventually it didn't seem to matter that much.Overall a great TV. I wouldn't trade it for anything."
5,Best TV I've ever owned!,"I ordered this on amazon a few weeks ago, got the wall mount and hooked it up in my studio apartment. Not only is it HUGE in here, but the image quality is BRILLIANT! I have my computer hooked up to it and an HD DVR. Every HD show out there looks phenomenal and the connecton from my computer looks great too. I could not be happier with this, between the price, the fast FREE shipping, the image quality, and the gorgeous piano black trim I can truly say this is the best television I've ever owned."
5,Great Product,"In a word ""fantastic"". Great picture on both analog and HD and the picture quality for DVDs is very very good. It was easy to connect to our Sony DVD surround sound system and cable system. Will certainly consider other Samsung products after our experience with this TV. Also, must give an A++ to Eagle and their delivery service. They were professional in every way."
1,Looks wonderful but handles get hot!,"I really loved the look of this cookware, with the contemporary style and clean lines. The construction is great too; it is pleasantly heavy and certainly appears and feels like it will last you a lifetime. The sad thing, though, and this prevented me replacing my worn, cheap student cookware with Bodum Chef peices (which I really wanted to do!) is that when I use this pan on my gas cooktop, even with a low heat (no flames licking the side), the handles get too hot to touch. Perhaps it's just this peice, because it's quite a small stock pot, but regrettably I deleted this stuff from my wish list. I wanted to buy their gorgeous pasta pot with strainer, and decided not to take the risk, because of my experience with this one.I would really urge the manufacturers to take another look at this aspect of the cookware and see if they can do anything about it, because it really is some nice looking, quality cookware."
4,My man Richard,"I've always pondered what type of life Little Richard had growing up, and now since the release of his autobiography, I don't have to ponder anymore. Little Richard had a fascinating life growing up. His mother married his father at age 13, and she became the strength of the family. It's really interesting hearing how he was confronted with the injustice and unfairness during those days. Little Richard was an amazing talent who didn't receive his just dues for his contribution to Rock and Roll, but he always remained positive and should go down in history as one of the greatest song writer and entertainer of all times."
5,Worth buying,"As an archaeology student, I purchased this DVD to use as part of my research on flint knapping techinques. Aside from the sections on tool making, the rest of the DVD is informative and easy to understand. It would be a good program for high school teachers to use as an introduction to an archaeology or anthropology class."
1,A real misnomer!,"I had ordered a book about the ""American Paint Horse"" and expected a ""photographic portrayal."" What I got was a book about Americans who happen to own Paint horses -- I didn't want that and I don't need that!The design and photography is quite pedestrian (pun intended), I had seen better photography by Stoecklein before.At least I learned one lesson from this: don't trust customer reviews too much! Now I search for a real good coffee-tabler with real Paints and no people in it (no, I'm not a people-hater but I like things pure and neat)."
3,Could have been better,A documentary of the Hindenburg disaster through the eyes of actual eye witnesses. The missing element was Herb Morrison's radio announcement. Why was it left out?
4,Neil still rocks,"This DVD is great. Neil Young still rocks just like 25 years ago. Sounds a lot like the Crazy Horse years. Much better than Silver and Gold DVD. The best part is the 21 minute version of ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" played outside during a driving thunderstorm. It was incredible. Be careful if you order this to not order the ""DVD-audio"" version. That makes no sense to me at all since the DVD-video has the same songs (DTS and Dolby surround) and the incredible video to go with it at the same or cheaper price. Amazon has been confused about this since the video version was released in December so make sure they are sending you the right one."
1,"horrible, just horrible!",Come on Neil! This is awful. Another terrible live recording shown in all it's misery on DVD-A. This is surround? GAG ME!!
5,"Ignore The Naysayers, This is Prime Electric Neil","I don't know what the previous two reviewers are smokin', but it sure ain't the good s--t that Neil is smokin'. Maybe they ought to stay at home and listen to After The Gold Rush another two thousand times. For my money Neil and company deliver the goods and then some. Check out the incendiry guitar solo, (all eighteen plus minutes) of Cowgirl In The Sand. I saw the CSN&Y Reunion Tour at Madison Square Garden this summer. Neil did a tremendous job on Words that evening as he does here. Accuse him of many things, but Neil is anything but boring. The biting guitar exchange between Young and Ben Keith is nothing short of explosive. Ignore the naysayers, Road Rock is prime electric Neil. You won't be disappointed."
2,Shameless Compilation,Weak arrangement of tour cuts. You'll do better by burning your own CD from your favorites. It offered my Neil Young collection nothing I didn't already have.
3,Neil By Numbers Live,"Desperately seeking to become as irrelevant as Graham Nash, Neil released a live CD featuring friends and family. I've 2 words for Shakey: Linda McCartney, or if that doesn't do it: Yoko Ono. Leave the wife at home, the kid sister aint Nicollete Larsen.It's all very competently executed, but there's no sense that any of this really matters to him anymore. It is a better record than Year of the Horse and the soundtrack to Dead Man, but the fire is out, and that's a shame. It's better to burn out than...."
4,Best card for Home Networking or Office desktop PC,"I had tested this card and it works pretty good. The best feature I liked that it has good support for all kind of operating systems (even Novell Netware). The card uses Digital Electronics Corporation (DEC) chip. So even by mistake you happen to lose the orignal driver, I guess you can use the generic DEC driver if you have one. (I have tried this on Novell Netware and it works)."
4,Super Awesome item,"I just got this item a day ago and it was great. You get 1 of 4 variant cards: Horus the Black Flame Dragon Level 8, which is what I got, Silence Swordsman Level 5, Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys, or the Creator. And you get 3 elemental energy packs. In one of the packs, I got Elemental Hero Blade Edge. If you like strong cards, this is the thing for you."
5,Energy Healing for Beginners,"I anticipated receiving the same old information for Energy Healing, when I received this book . But boy was I surprised. Not that I thought I knew it all by a long shot. It helped me refresh information I had learned 30 years ago. This book put the information in simple terms that I was able to connect to and put into place of my over all knowledge. But the great awareness was that there was somethings I did not know, but by including them in this book it helps me do things easier to doing ""Hands on Healing"". I was very interested in helping to heal my self before I go back into the fieldEnergy Healing for Beginners: A Step-by-Step Guide to the Basics of Spiritual Healing"
1,Garbage,"I am not rating this review low because it should not have been made; which is a different discussion for another time. It is low because how it was written. I can try and explain to someone who has never been to church or seen a church about church, I can present pictures, I can give detailed drawings about HOW it works and how its done. But that person still will not know what its like to be there, to actually experience church. Same is true with this. Yes, is it accurate on how things work, for the most part (albeit the author does talk about ""contemporary"" Sun Dances, which are different than Traditional). Again, without discussing why that is important as that is another topic for another time. The book gives the HOW a dance is done, but it doesn't explain the why or the what. The most important is the why and the what. It gives people a FALSE understanding of Sun Dance."
4,"Dark, disturbing and completely mesmerizing","Imagine a modernized Brothers Grimm tale for adults. Perfect for anyone that loved The Manchurian Candidate or Jacob's Ladder. Wallace leads the reader into Poland as well as a forgotten Hamelin to face the horrors of war, a mysterious disease, and a town under siege. Gruesome and gripping, Wallace cuts to the heart of the Pied Piper tale and exposes the frightening truth--the Piper is here to save us from ourselves."
4,Engaging to the end,"This book was captivating from the beginning, and the author creates an eerie sense of anticipation that builds as the story unfolds.For parents encouraging young teenage children to build their reading and reasoning abilities, this book could be quite an exciting challenge. The author has sufficient command of the power of language that he didn't have to stoop to using ""strong"" language to cover his own weakness. The few love scenes are fairly discreet as well.The only small criticism I have is that the ending is not quite as surprising as the author would have us believe. Imagine sitting through a very well structured talk, only to have the conclusion be something a bit more obvious than you might have expected. Enjoyable all the same. If Mr. Wallace has more books out, I expect to read another soon."
3,weak ending after a good start,"Halfway through this book, I thought I'd found a classic - but I found the ending very weak. The author opts for some generic ""we all have evil in us"" preaching and the parallel between the post-WW2 and Hamelin stories is pointless - each story has the same general moral, so there's no reason to have both. The author has a good style, characterizes well and moves the story along effectively, but I agree with another reviewer who said there really isn't a sense of despair/hopelessness created"
3,Decent Debut,"Much as I expected and wanted to love this book, I didn't. The notion of intertwining the story of a young doctor working with post-WWII refugees in occupied Germany, with a scholarly ""true"" account of the Pied Piper story was intriguing. Unfortunately, this device of alternating storylines proved inherently predictable. The reader knows the two stories are related and will converge, and when they do so without an interesting twist or unexpected direction, it's ultimately somewhat of a letdown. That's not to say Wallace isn't a quality writer, because he is, and for a first novel, it the prose is very accomplished, and he sets the historical scenes nicely. However, unlike others, I never felt he quite instilled that sense of the human capacity for evil that gripped me as it did in books like Jose Saramango's ""Blindness,"" or Duncan McLean's ""Bunker Man"" nor is it as effective a post-WWII work as Melvin Bukiet's ""After."" Still, I look forward to Wallace's next book."
2,Not A Single Likable Character In This Book,"You can read well written descriptions of the dual plots of this novel from other reviewers, so I will share what I believe to be its weaknesses.There is not a single likable character in either plot. Wallace's moving descriptions of the despair and squalor found throughout every scene is dulled from a lack of attachment to any character. Creepy and bloodthirsry? Sure. Yawn.The two plots do not weave together seamlessly. Both plots went into fascinating detail that make me want to read up more on the 30 years war. And there were some red herrings- notably about rye and argot- that were tantilizing. But the book's conclusion about the 'rat inside all of us' waiting to revert to baser instincts was a real letdown.If you are an admirer of loose ends, insufficiently fleshed out characters, and anti-heroes, you will find much to praise.If you are like me, you will not toss this book aside lightly, but will fling it with great force."
1,poor narration,"The book is a novel with some good ideas. The narration is, though, poor. The author is less than convincing in the descriptions as well as in his style. He tries to attract the reader's attention by writing ""ladies and gentlemen"" every second page, with dubious effects. The historical characterization is not enticing at all and the book lacks a persuasive conclusion. I think it is a easy reader, but, other than, that I can't find a reason for recommending it."
1,Way Overpriced,"This pamphlet states the obvious about health. It doesn't have much useful and is basically just to promote the products created by this doctor. To sum up the booklet, it says to see a kinesiologist and then use the author's products if you have Lyme. It also says avoid nutrasweet, msg, soda, smoking, alcohol, junk food. Drink water and deap breathe. That's about it. I just saved you 10 bucks."
2,its ok i like mtv gene 1 better,i liked the first version better...it was more easier....and funk master flex (...)....and scribbles 2....why dont ya put little loui vega up in that...or david morales to do the 3rd version...pleeeeease...they have better music to offer..and code masters need to work on the usb better.....make it more affectiveits ok but it could be way better the sound quality is not that great
1,DONT BUY,"Don't buy this game!! This game is horrible and it gets boring very quickly. Games like ESPN snowboarding you spend hours playing cause it is so great. This game is fun at first but gets very boring. All the sound clips stink and after you have made a song it stinks!! Save your money and don't get this game, get ESPN snowboarding or Tiger Woods PGA Golf!"
2,2 and 1/2 at best...,"I bought this game with high expectations because of all the great reviews on amazon, in magazines, etc... Plus the fact that i have been a fan of music all my life, especially DJ type stuff which MTV:MG2 claims to provide. but if you really want to make some GOOD music i would advise against it. first off every single vocal-riff is terrible and almost hurts to listen to them. the vocal-riffs all sound ""pop,"" meaning you hear some annoying little 18 year old singing ""ohhhhh yeeeaaahh baaaby."" most of the riffs, other than vocals, are pretty chill but if you want to actually put together your own songs and not lift from other artists it is hard to make a solid rythem. the reason for this is because in riff-edit mode you can only point to one key at a time which is a real .... In all honesty this game just ins't very good. if you really want to make some GOOD music then take your money elsware"
5,A BLAST!!!!!,"This game is so much fun! It gives anyone with an imagination the ability to create music that sounds great! Don't let other reviews fool you it isn't really that hard. It is a bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be putting songs together with your eyes closed!"
3,An above average music tool,"if you are a big music fan and know alot about how music works and how to create it, this game might be a little too boring for you. this game may last you up to 3 days at the most, but eventually you'll grow tiresome of this tool and want to move on to bigger and better things, like i have. this game used to be my prime tool for making what i thought was good music, but when you take a look at all the other stuff out there, this is very minor. if you're just starting out making music, this would be a fun tool for you to mess around with, and it's not too difficult to get started. so my recommendation would be for advanced users to pass this one by, but not so advanced users might wanna check it out."
4,Brunswick Ball Cleaner,Pretty good ball cleaner. I get a lot of gunk from my alleys ball return. This product makes fairly short work of cleaning this gunk off my ball.....
4,Good Stuff even on a Roto-Grip,"Does the trick and lengthens the ball when it ""bites"" early, works even on a Roto Grip "" Bandit """
4,Gets the Job Done,"Although it didn't remove the marks from my Nexus Solid (even though it says it does), it does do a fine job of removing all the gunk and oil from the surface, which is what I was really after."
1,self-promotion this blatant won't work,"Read the excerpt from this stinker and ask yourself if you really want to shell out money for more. Oh, and Mr. Roman, your relentless self-promotion on Amazon pages for other, more intriguing books, is just a little too shamelessly obvious."
5,"Very unique, different, witty and highly entertaining","I found this book about a first date to be very well written in a unique style. Both characters were interesting, witty, and very human. The author's insight into both the female and male perspectives on a first date was different, yet very revealing. The characters did not at all fit into common stereotypes. Yet, I found it easy to relate to both. I particularly liked the female character, however, who was very strong and sexy. Most of all, the book was a quick enjoyable read. The underlying sensitivities and nuances from both characters are carefully and magically woven in to bring the characters to life and make the reader care about both of them ... to want them to make a connection."
3,interesting - but would likely never happen this way ...,"I had ordered this book a year or two ago and the package was so small i apparently hid it away and just happened upon it again. i find it hard to imagine that it got all these positive reviews for dialogue. while it is clearly interesting (up until mid way where i started a wonder a little...), the conversation is beyond what would happen on a first date. and if it did, it's NOT that interesting. the most benefit it has is lending insight into men and women because these two characters SAY the things that might just be thought about on a date. i had mixed feelings about this book but it did have a nice ending."
5,Great Dialogue!!,"What a great idea for a book. Two very human people on a first date trying to impress the other while battling their own insecurities. Simple yet unique. The all dialogue book is very difficult to pull off, but the author does it with some great observations and witticisms without relying on any conventional cliches. Being a single woman in her late twenties, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gave me some perspective on the whole dating scene. Above all else, it's suppose to be fun."
1,Will you cut it out already?!,"The ""review"" below was taken from the page for Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel THE HOURS. Mr. Roman, have you *no* sense of decorum?:.... ""Wow. The readers really seem to have extreme reactions to this series of novellas. I thought it was extremely well done. In particular, I appreciated the originality of the work. I also really enjoy the novella format. For readers who like this form, I would highly recommend both The Love of a Good Woman by Alice Munro and Fried Calamari by D.M. Roman."""
1,Fried reviewers,"I rank Ellis up there with D.M. Roman, the author of Fried...oops, wrong review! That was someone from Merion, PA (say, isn't that suburban Philadelphia, where D.M. Roman lives?) oozing unctuously all over the putrid Glamorama. And what a coincidence that so many of the 5-star reviews on this page also hail from the Philadelphia area!"
5,Like drinking a good glass of Merlot,"Reading Fried Calamari is like drinking a good glass of Merlot. The reader can sit back, relax and laugh at the anxiety, insecurity, and hope that accompanies a first date (while taking comfort that they are not on the date themselves). I found Fried Calamari to be witty, insightful, and very entertaining. It captures the fun (and horror) that we all have experienced on a first date."
4,Fried Calamari -- Tasty Treat!,"If you want a great, quick read while you're slaving through the latest 400 plus-page novel, I suggest you pick up Fried Calamari. This short, almost novella, 120-something page delectable escapade reminded me of High Fidelity. DM Roman writes about relationships in a way we all think about but are afraid to admit.Incredibly funny and unusually honest, I breezed through this book in a couple hours. My girlfriend is reading it now. No doubt some interesting conversations will follow about relationships, past and present."
1,Self-Promotion,"As to the people commenting on the below reviews being self-promotion, let me just say that I work in a chain-bookstore which has recently been hit by a plague of special orders for this book by a person whose address and phone number don't really exist. The book in non-returnable to the publisher, so we are stuck with it on our shelves. I'll let you try to figure out for yourself who that person might be."
5,A Delicious Treat,"Fried Calamari is a delicious treat that unfolds the story of a first date in an all-dialogue format. I read this book twice. The first time purely for entertainment and on the second read, I tried to pick up all of the insights in the underlying subtext. On both accounts, this book came out a winner."
1,Lousy dialogue,"This book should have worked for me... a single thirty year old who's been dating different people in the last year. It was nothing like any of the dates I've been on. It was like what a guy is titillated by, thinking of a blind date."
3,Egg Protein,"Although it is very high in protein, I thought the vanilla ice cream flavor was very bland. I would not buy this again as it was not tasty enough."
1,not good,"The protein powder is ok, not to good as i expected. if you pour hot milk over it will will form substance like egg white, which is very bad in taste, not at all drinkable."
2,Tastes DISGUSTING but great protein,"I bought the Strawberry Passion and it tastes absolutely DISGUSTING. It makes me sick. It doesn't taste anything like strawberry or passionfruit. It has great protein quality.If you want to buy this, DON'T buy Strawberry Passion."
4,Great Product,"I've tried a number of protein powders over the years. Most problems I encountered ranged from poor taste, to not mixing well, to leaving me bloated. The Healthy n Fit egg protein is only 100 calories and you get 24 grams of protein with no cholesterol, no fat, no carbs, minimal sodium (in the big scheme of things) and even some potassium. Add to that the fact that it mixes really well and tastes good either on it's own or mixed with fruit. I don't feel bloated with this at all like I did with other products like Muscle Milk light. I usually throw a banana and some blueberries into a blender with one serving of the protein for breakfast and then I use it straight right after a good workout. Again, it tastes great on it's own or mixed with fruit. I strongly recommend this product."
3,It's good once you doctor it up a little bit!,"I use this as a whey/soy protein alternative. I am allergic to soy and have sensitivity to whey and this product seems to be free of both. I actually haven't used it as a shake, but I use it to make protein pancakes. I find I have to add extra cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey and stevia to make it more sweet. At first I came out with some really awful pancakes, but after I found the perfect ingredients to doctor it up, they all come out amazing!!! So if your looking for an alternative to whey and soy, I definitely think this is a good choice!"
5,Triana,"This book is a comprehensive study of Triana's theatre, from pre-revolution to the present. This book is complete and makes a great contribution to the world of Latin American literary criticism."
2,not as expected,Picture on DVD does not comply to the contains! The ship on the picture is not one of the wrecks in the story!
3,So So,"Because of this, I dont purchase special polish any longer. Just the 1st time I used, lost the edge. Ball stopped hooking properly."
1,I wish...,"Sometimes you read a story that maks you sit back and ponder the meaning of life. Sometimes a story can change the way you live your life. I wish I could say the same about Chains of the Sea. The was almost the worst piece trash I've ever read. The worse being so bad that I will not mention it's name. A good book should make you care for the characters. I can honestly say after reading this piece of drek that I do not give a damn about Tommy, his mother, his little friends, or anyone else in this book. The only thing I can say about this book is I wish I had the 2 hours of my life back that took to read it."
1,Another Recycled Advocacy Polemic,"This appears to be a compilation of papers that Mr. Thornton previously wrote on behalf of his former employer, Greenpeace. So, if you are still curious, save your money and just browse the Greenpeace web site. Like the original papers, this book is an advocacy piece that does not address or reference contrary data or interpretations. Apply the precautionary principle in digesting Mr. Thornton's ideas."
1,Pandora's Pablum,"This book is an appalling, hyperbole-laden, utterly misinformed assault on the scientific basis of environmental regulation. It reflects the growing anti-science trend that is masquerading as the ""democratization"" of science. It is an unfortunate example of how science can be deceptively manipulated to make seemingly reasonable policy arguments. The author not only fails to acknowledge the tremendous gains that have been made in environmental quality since the environmental regulations he deplores have been put in place, he also fails to acknowledge the tremendous work done by others to move towards a more ""holistic"" strategy to control chemical contamination. This book is dishonest, misleading, and pious."
1,Sophomoric Dribble,"From the book itself (p. 434): By encouraging an enlightened view of the status of scientific knowledge and its political use, reflexivity has set the stage for the advent of a new approach to environmental policy. In turn, the Ecological Paradigm promises to carry the process of reflexivization further by exposing the political issues behind technological decisions and involving the public more broadly in the creation of scientific knowledge."
1,It's What He Leaves Out That Hurts,"This is an ambitious book that has a lot to teach us, but it is flawed by what the author chose to hide from his audience. For example, he fails to report the dramatic decline in human exposure to toxins during the past 20 years; the major methodological flaws in research he cites as ""proof"" of a negative effect on human health from exposure to background levels; the very tenuous and often false assumptions that lie behind his proposed ""new paradigm"" (and the fact that this paradigm isn't new at all, but standard fare for many years from Greenpeace and other anti-technology voices); and more. I give Thornton credit for admitting his anti-corporation and pro-government biases at the outset and, at the end, calling for a socialist reorganization of the U.S. economy and higher education. Discerning readers will recognize just how far from the intellectual mainstream Thornton and this book are. I do not recommend it."
5,"Save the Planet, Buy This Book","Pandora's Poison sets a new standard for science and politics. It not only exposes the politics of big business that dominates so much of US evironmental policy. It's also full of amazing, well documented scientific facts that everyone from environmentalists to academics and maybe even enlightened corporations and politicians can put to good use.In addition, Mr. Thornton's engaging style of writing makes technical issues come alive in easy to understand lay language. He also gets high marks for objectivity by presenting the chemical industry's views in a fair and thorough way before making a powerful refutation of their arguments.However, the real gift of this book is the compelling but common sense case that Thronton makes for a new policy paradigm to eliminate pollution. Posterity will not look kindly on us if we ignore the wisdom of these pages."
2,disappointed,Was very disappointed when I got this package. I thought I was ordering a CD-ROM and discovered that it was a floppy disk. What computers even come with that option any more? They should have been more detailed on the product when you order it.
5,A neglected version of Strauss' neglected opera,"The five stars are not for this recording, although we owe Gwyneth Jones a great deal for reviving interest in this opera. Another fine version of Die agyptische Helena to consider is the live recording from Bayerische Staatsoper, under Keilberth's direction, with Leonie Rysanek in the title role, well-supported by Aldenhoff (Menelas), Kupper (Aithra), Uhde (Altair), and especially Holm (Da-ud). It dates from 1956, but the sound is excellent, atmospheric, and totally engaging. It is pure Richard Strauss, unworldly, sometimes dissonant, but mostly lyrical and mesmerizing. Hofmannstahl thought it his best libretto (most would strongly disagree - after all, Der Rosenkavalier, etc., ...). Here we have something between early Strauss (e.g., Salome, 1905) and later Strauss (e.g., Daphne, 1937) - still quintessential Strauss. It has been unfairly neglected. One footnote, pay no attention to the ridiculous plot. Just savour the music."
4,The Burning,Robert Mason tells you the story of Annie White as if she is reading you her diary. He draws you in because he has done a good job at reserching the Arizona territory before it became a state. But the reason for the burning of the 2 houses are only speculated on.Her 20year fight for compensation leaves the reader sympathetic and profoundly moved.
3,15 x 30 Easy set pool,"The set up was like it said after leveling the ground which took about a day. The only draw backs is the sides of the pool are very weak and a child of 40lbs or more that grabs for the sides will collapse it and either the kid comes out with the water or just the water itself and a whole lot of it. Constant supervision is needed, also the pump is not efficeint enough for this size. My recommendation is to get at least a framed pool or one with sturdy walls."
2,Easy Set Pool by Intex,"After reading other reviews ... we decided to buy an Easy Set Pool. We are very disappointed with the pool. It is no where near 30"" high! I have an average sized seven year old and the water comes up to her knee. Needless to say, we are very sorry we bought this pool. They made it sound like it was a pool for the whole family, at best is is an okay kids pool, but far from worth the money that we paid for it. You would be better off with one of those big blow up pools for 1/4 the money."
2,Not even close to the real thing...,"Who hasn't heard of Jacques Brel (1929-1978) the extraordinary Belgian signer/songwriter. Lama has! His early work even tries to emulate Brel's style (he will eventually find his own). It comes as no surprise, then, that he wanted to sing Brel's beautiful songs. The problem is that Lama comes short.Don't get me wrong, I love Serge Lama... when he sings is own songs. I even own is entire work (see ""ame a nue - l'integrale"" 12 CDs box set). But, not many people (if any!) can sing Brel. Lama is no exception. Even the song selection leaves to desire.In short, if you are looking for good material by Serge Lama, check out: ""Collection: Femme Femme Femme"" [IMPORT].If you would like to discover Jacques Brel, go for: ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"" [IMPORT]."
5,Great Watch,"I have had this watch for about 2 months now and wear it in the ocean at least 3 or 4 times a week. It has been by far the best watch I have ever owned. It looks great, keeps great time and is extremely comfortable. The clasp has four adjustment locations that allow you to dial in the bracelet perfectly. The face of the watch has a lower profile than most dive watches, which, in my opinion, makes it even more comfortable. There are only two gripes I have with this watch. The adjustment knob and bezel are a little difficult to turn (slippery) and the nighttime markers aren't the brightest I have ever seen. All in all though, this is a great watch."
2,Dirty!,I ordered this for my sister who collects nutcrackers and loves the wizard of oz. All in all it is very cute but I purchased what I thought was a NEW nutcracker. Everything about both the doll and the box suggests that it is old and has been used. Her face and hands are dirty and her hair has dust and other unknown particles. The box looks dirty and tore up. The seller lists the item as new but I'm not so sure.
3,good for the money,"As a freelance gardener who works for about 30 regular garden clients, I still am in search of the perfect popup bag to haul yard waste to my truck. I want one that holds 20-30 gallons of yard waste, is durable, and when dragged across grass does not wear out around the bottom edges (exposing the metal loops). Once the loops are expose, the bag has to be thrown out as it begins to unravel. This one has lasted a few months, but is still is not the perfect bag. Often times, it seems the handles tear off or their stitches loosens, or the botton hooks break. The fabric, too is pretty decent, doesn't seem to snag or tear. That did not occur with this bag. I tend to go through about 10 pup-ups a year and want to find one that will last longer. I might reorder another one, but am still searching for the best one available."
3,It's not for everyone...,"I actually have the older version of this you can get off Terry's website, but its the same thing. This is an interesting CD, but I have to agree with the other reviewer here who said it is long, drug out, and certainly not rock. The fact that it's not rock doesn't bother me in the least. This album is a bit boring and, as with Terry's other solo drum music albums, it tends to be far to frantic to listen to comfortably for any length of time. I can't imagine someone popping this in to entertain or relax with.I would suggest, that if you want a Bozzio album you can listen to and hear some amazing drumwork, get Situation Dangerous or Black Light Syndrome by Bozzio, Levine, and Stevens. That way you also get to listen to Steve Steven's amazing guitar and Tony Levine's bass work."
2,A little out there,"Renowned rock drummer meets established orchestra; the combination works on an eccentric level, but on a casual level, not so much. I'm sure that drum aficionados will appreciate Bozzio's unique approach to his drum work here, but the songs are so long and drawn out (and far from rock), that they tend to lose their appeal."
5,This cd was awesome,"This cd has some great music on it, it's definetly worth a listen. I haven't heard the originals, so I can't say I know what exactly was done to them, but even if DJ Andy only picked them out and crossfaded one to the next (I know he did more than that, but this is for examples sake), I'd still give him props for pickin' out some phat tracks and layin' 'em down in good order."
2,Just a collections of songs...,"Albiet a decent one. This is basically a mix tape of songs that are in no way mixed up. No cuts, no scratched. Songs just fade away and then a new one starts. It's hard to figure how this guy is a DJ. The songs are cool, but who wants the James Gang? Not a bad introduction to some classic hip hop and artists that have been plundered for samples (like the Meters). This is what happens when you are portishead-obsessed and want to buy anything/everthing Portishead related."
2,Meh,"Just not a very good movie. I love football, and enjoyed parts of the movie, but overall neither my wife nor I enjoyed it all that much."
2,"Silly, old-fashioned movie...","Being a huge George Clooney fan, I will see just about anything he is in. This one was a big disappointment. Firstly, he seemed to old for the part and secondly it seemed to try too hard to be a movie from the 50s. Certainly it was not unpleasant, but I would rather have spent my time watching the superb ""Michael Clayton"" or the even better ""Good Night and Good Luck"" again."
3,A fun Laugh,"One of the pieces of truth I learned many years ago is this; ""If we do not learn from History we are doomed to repeat it.""George Clooney gives us all a chance to learn from history, gain a bit of wisdom and smile while doing it. In all of his movies, and this one is no exception, he plays a fun character who takes chances in the present so that tomorrow can be better than yesterday. The CFL & the NFL have learned from yesterday, they keep improving their game and they both keep the future filled with possibilities, thanks George Clooney for bring the past back so movies like this can help us dream about the future. This movie was a good laugh!"
2,What???,"I was looking forward to a fun comedy about the early days of Professional Football and I got... um, what?I am a fan of John Krasinski and Stephen Root, but not even they could bring life to this movie that seemed to be full of twists that weren't fun but just leaving me with the feeling of ""What?""I didn't find any of the characters appealing, nor worth carrying about it. Actually, I got to the point of wanting to fast forward it to the end just so that I could say that I watched it from beginning to end, but I did. I'm glad that I only rented it and didn't buy it like I had intended to do.There are other things I could say about this film, but I won't. I'll leave that to you who watch it.The good is bad and the bad is good."
3,very lightweight leatherheaded fare,"This is a pleasant enough diversion for an hour and a half, and then you will forget it rather quickly. The cast is charming, but the story is not very compelling. The soundtrack is probably worth listening to, though."
1,Careful - incompatible with many DVD players,"Sometimes a product review is needed instead of a movie review. This is one of those times. This review is about the product - a DVD that is supposed to have a playable movie on it.I never managed to watch Leatherheads because the DVD has some type of new DRM (digital rights management) that is incompatible with my DVD player. It isn't an old player either. I've received and sent back 4 different Leatherheads DVDs with netflix. Once I finally researched it a bit I found the truth. It's an intentionally crippled product. I don't feel like getting a new player every time a studio decides to alienate the public.So, if you buy this thing, keep the receipt and test it pronto. Even if you aren't going to watch it right away. See if it works in your player. You may need to get a different movie for that night at home.Beware buying this as a gift for anyone. They'll politely smile as they ask if you saved the receipt."
4,Leatherhead DVD,"Anybody who's a Clooney fan has to have this...it's not as good as some of his other movies, but it's still truly Clooney...fun to watch, although I still don't think the ending really makes sense as it is shown."
3,OK on DVD not in the theater,"I expected more comedy and a gritty football story.Don't buy the Blu-ray, not worth the extra dollar."
2,Old School Humor,I thought this movie was pretty good. It is old school humor but it has a few yucks in there. Clooney is always good but this movie misses as compared to some of his better comedy roles. I still enjoyed it and think that it will get over with most. It just wasn't great.
3,I wanted to like it,"I'm a huge Office fan. I'm a George Clooney fan. I even like football. But they lost me in almost the first five minutes with the longest and loudest intro in the history of movies. It has its moments, and I love the slapstick side of GC, but it just didn't carry this film."
4,Fun movie of a bygone era,"In the 1920's the best football games were found on college campuses. In this movie, George Clooney's character is an aging football player who is trying to put pro football on the map. He pirates a popular war hero turned Princeton football player and suddenly the crowds begin to follow the pro teams. Renee Zellweger is a sassy, saucy girl reporter who catches Clooney's eye, but seems more interested in the war hero. This is a fun movie which does a great job of depicting the mid-20's while being light and entertaining."
2,A Gift,This was the second vendor to order this blu-ray dvd from. The first time it arrived damaged. It took several e-mails to get credit for it because the vendor apparently did not have any more copies.The second vendor did much better. It arrived in timely fashion and apparently is in good shape since I have not heard from the recipient.

2,Punt,"As a comedy, this movie isn't very funny. As a depiction of early pro-football it isn't accurate. As a sports movie, it has all the stale conventions of the genre. Hollywood just can't make a good sports movie--with the exception of ""Raging Bull.""We know who's going to win the big game finale. It never fails. And in 1925 there's a radio announcer to tell us what's happening, in case we are all sight impaired. The thing is, there were no sports broadcasts in 1925. There's a fight, with haymakers galore, and no one has a mark on him. Perish the thought that the stars would have a fat lip. The mud in the final game never besmudges the stars except for their uniforms.The acting just--well--isn't. Zellweger looks nice, as usual, but her acting talents are wasted here. Clooney will please the women who like to look at him, but that's scarcely a talent.This is, in the final analysis, a piece of fluff to be blown off as quickly as possible."
5,Gap Band CD Purchase,I am very happy with my CD that I purchased. I would purchase another with no problems. thanks
2,"Good story, but disappointing, shortened version.","I was looking forward to getting this book, and reading it to my children for Christmas. However, the actual edition was quite disappointing. For one thing, it is so small (3"" x 3"") that it is very hard to read, the pictures are hard to see. The reviews on the website implied that it was the full set of stories, with adventures about goblins. Indeed, the back of the book has an excerpt talking about goblins. However, the subset of letters in the actual book has none of the stories dealing with goblins! The stories that are there are nice, but often disjointed because they refer to previous years' events that are past, and there are too few stories, and the pictures are too small. If I had seen this book in a bookstore, I would not have bought it, but it was difficult to judge over the internet. I cannot recommend this book."
3,Charming,One can imagine Tolkien and his children by the fire. Father Christmas lives in this book and the reader rediscovers his/her childhood again.
4,"The Dummy ""Bloody Anniversary""","This is one of my favorite independent horror films! I like all Todd Cook's movies but this is one of his best! Considering the super low budget there working from it keeps you watching all the way through. The dummy apears in another one of his movie shorts also. I always found dolls, dummies and manniquins really good subjet matter for horror movies."
2,Awful quality and acting,"This film is very low budget. Not the italian ""gore"" film it appears to be. Terrible acting and awful shooting,grainy and imbalanced. The only thing scary about this low grade film is the actors look like they got hit with the ugly stick. Includes VERY unforgettable nudity. Trust me,the image is still burned into my head. You don't want to find out what I mean,just stay away. This DVD is not worth fifteen bucks hell it's not even worth the ten bucks I just wasted. Remember to always read your reviews and take them seriously."
3,"3 Car Garage is ok, but I prefer Middle of Nowhere","I only gave 3 Car Garage 3 stars because I think that they all sing 2 high (Yeah, like they could help it back then!)& U can't tell the difference between Zac & Tay. I <3 U HANSON! ~JILL~"
3,I am a Fan of Hanson!,"Even though I am a great fan of Hanson, I was disappointed with a lot of their songs. Middle of Nowhere is much better. Hail Hanson!!! If they make another C.D. (which they better) it must be better than 3-car garage. I liked two tears though."
4,The bean that's just now pushing its way out of the topsoil,"Hanson shows in this album that they are NOT the New Kids on the Block, that they are NOT the Jackson 5 et cetera, but that they are some suprisingly talented kids in more ways than posing. I heard this album passively while my teenybopper sister played it. As the album went on though, I payed more and closer attention. I was especially impressed by the actually poignant Tin Soldier song. They aren't Billy Joel or The Beatles--at least not yet--but all things considered, this is most definately a trio to watch. Ten years from now...who knows?Let's just hope fame, screaming girls and money-grubbing media mogels don't ruin them along the way."
5,Hanson: More than Teen Idols!,"If you still think Hanson is some cheesy industry exec's creation to gouge money out of the teenyboppers, listen to this album. Ike, Tay, and Zach were doing their thing long before ""Middle of Nowhere."" To be honest, I actually find this album refreshingly honest and real compared to the sometimes overproduced ""Middle of Nowhere."" This is the music the way the boys themselves intended it, and they have good instincts. For example ""With You in Your Dreams"" which comes off sappy and artificial on ""Nowhere"" really takes on a moving gospel quality here. And the energy of ""Day Has Come"" really beats out a lot of the newer material! While I like ""Nowhere"" quite a bit I have really fallen in love with this album much more. Very solid and not just for kids!"
5,GREAT EARILY CD,"This cd is very raw. You can tell it wasn't produced like ""Middle Of Nowhere"" was. It is their earily cd and they show LOTS of talent and creativity!! I love the song about the one legged toy solder. The last song on the disc brought tears to my eyes. Those kids are very talented. I only gave this a 9 rating because it wasn't as good as their ""Middle Of Nowhere"" cd was. But, that is understandible this was recorded before they even got a record deal!! Hats off to those guys!! They have lots of GREAT years ahead!!"
5,A taste of classic Hanson,"So you might think ""Once you hear Middle of Nowhere why would you go back?"" Well, my friends, this album is awesome. With the original tracks of ""MMMbop,"" ""Thinking of You,"" and ""With You In Your Dreams,"" you can see why this is the stuff that got them signed."
5,3 Car Garage- Hanson cd for my 5 yr old,"I bought this cd for my daughter Avery that is 5 years old. It is perfect for her age because of how they sound. She is now a huge hanson fan and has met them twice in a matter of 6 or 7 months...lucky kid!! i just met them in march 2009 and i'm 24 lol. Anyways, the cd was awesome, no scratches on it, and I would love to purchase more from the seller. Seems to have great quality in the products being sold! :)"
3,Plast From the Past,This album I will admit is not my favorite. But I enjoy hearing how people that young can do so much. The talent they possessed at such a young age was incredible! The songs that were cut from Middle of Nowhere were great to hear.
1,This is crap!,"This, and the first Hanson sisters CD, is one of the worst albums of all time. I can't believe any sane person could listen to this crap. These guys are worse than the spice girls, and almost as bad as the Backstreet Boys and Marylin Manson! If you want good dance music, listen to Smash Mouth, Five Iron Frenzy, or even the Bosstones."
5,I THINK THAT THIS CD IS VERY GOOD B/C THEY ARE SO TALENT,I THINK THAT HANSON IS RECOMENDED FOR ALL AGES B/C THEY ARE SO YOUNG AND TALENT. AND THINK WHEN YOU WHERER THAT AGE YOU COULD MAKE SO MUCH MONEY. THEY MAKE MORE THEN THERER MOM AND DAD DO SO IF EVERYONE STARTED THEIR DREAM AT THAT AGE THEY COULD BE EVEN BETTER.
5,Brilliant,Hanson are so great. At first I thought it was all mixing and that they weren't that good in real life. But when I bought 3 car Garage I realised that it is them and they do have talent. I recomend this to any Hanson fan.
5,Young and brilliant!!!!!,"Wow, I'm really impressed at these three brothers!! They sure have alot of talent!! You just go ""WOW"" when you think about how young they were when they did all of these songs... like they aren't young enough now!! *laughs* This cd is very good. They guys (especially Tay ) sounds so young, but that's just cute!! My favve songs on it are ""Surely As The Sun"", ""River"", ""Stories"", ""Pictures"" and ""Day Has Come"". I highly recommend this album!!! =)"
3,Even guys can like Hanson!,"I admit it. I am a 21-year-old male who likes Hanson's music. There's no shame in that, either! This album, while not as good as either Middle of Nowhere or Snowed In, shows that this group is no prefabricated pop group like the Spice Girls or the Backstreet Boys. They have real talent and just needed the support to focus it. The songs aren't as memorable as those from their first album, and the vocals aren't the greatest (due to some cheap studio time, I'm guessing), but the early versions of ""MMMBop,"" ""Thinking of You,"" and ""With You in Your Dreams"" are fantastic. This is an album for completists, not for someone who hasn't acquired a taste for Hanson's music."
2,"It's No ""Middle Of Nowhere""...","Let's see we have the original, hit album; the rush-to-stores-while-trend-is-hot Live album; The obligitory Christmas album; More appearances on the Disney Channel than 'N Sync and Cleopatra put together; and now THIS! A mini album of outtakes and demo versions culled by their doddering, overbearing yuppie, anal upper 1% Rodeo Drive parents. Thank you SO much."
1,Wore then Middle Of Nowhere!,"I used to actully like this band about three years ago but now there old and gone. But this one is A LOT worse. I can't believe people actully liked this album it (...)! People were were also calling there voices strong!!!!!!!!!! I don't think so. The drums are messed up BIG TIME, Taylor sounds like a baby just banging on the keyboards, and Zac and Isaac sound really bad on guitar and drums. If you want good independant albums check out Green Day's 1,039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours and there Kerplunk album. They were actully signed to a independant label when those were done! At least they have talent, unlike Hanson."
2,This album is boring,The C-D has alot of the songs from their previous C-D's. The songs that aren't on those C-D's aren't that great. I would not recomend this title.
1,dont waste money,i think this cd is stupid. you would have to pay me to buy it. All it is are some GIRLS whose voices havent changed playing pop(heavy metal! hahahahahahahah). Dont buy it Email me Hanson Freaks
1,erm...no...,"First of all,I do think Hanson are great but this CD is pretty awful.Recorded in a garage before they became household names,while Taylor's exceptional voice is evident(especially in the original WithYouInYourDreams which sounds better than the hit version),heaps of the songs are real unbearable,especially a couple where Ike is the singer.Not that he cant sing but....well,you know.They are just yuck."
1,Awful.,"This film is purely about demonizing the white nationalist movement by portraying an uneducated, foul-mouthed, emotionally unstable and psychopathic young thug as your typical neo-Nazi, who does nothing but spew racist, hateful clichés like an android acting on autopilot. The Jewish lawyer is a boring character whom the actor tries to portray as a broody, pseudo-witty do-gooder but comes off rather lame. (SPOILER WARNING:) The ending is borderline cheesy as the neo-Nazi criminal ""finds the light"" when he reads his victim's letter and realizes that he speaks like a (rather clichéd) Buddha. Sure, you can convert an angry, violent, hate-filled fascist at the drop of a bat by getting an Indian guy to write him some nice words, did you know? All they need is a little sunshine and rainbows!I say watch ""American History X"" instead."
5,It's Alright,"I love having my birthstone with me whether it's earrings or necklaces or rings, and this bracelet just adds on."
1,would never buy again!,"I used this product for a year and a half and felt as though it was filled with weed growth! The more I sprinkled the faster my weeds grew. Would not buy this product again. Was so happy to see ""organic"" weed preventer but this product drove me so crazy I am thinking of using some good old fashioned chemicals."
3,"Brittle, tense readings, best taken one at a time","Pollini views the seven mature Polonaises of Chopin as militant works expressive of Polish fire and pride. I applaud that, but to hear all of them in a row, each played with brittle, aloof fierceness, is taxing.Things are not helped by DG's unpleasantly clangy piano sound. We are inside the lid, and there are moments when the head-bashing becomes intolerable for any long stretch. I would also say that in the two famous major-key Polonaises, the ""Heroic"" and ""Military,"" Pollini oculd have relented and given us a sense of exuberance without so much percussive insistence. I'm am a huge fan, but this 1976 release is my least favorite Pollini recital."
5,Moving and Real,"I love this book! The Fiercer Heart is not a book I would typically seek out, but I happened to see the jacket cover at the library, and decided to try it. Being a native of Louisville, I was especially drawn into the story after finding out that one family of characters were from my city, and several chapters were set in familiar areas. It was also fascinating to discover that the characters were real, and the story was constructed around old diaries and letters from the family. Ms. Gilchrist has done a wonderful job in transporting the reader back in time. The 1800's is an era I do not know much about, but the author describes in vivid detail so well you truly feel like you're there. By the end (well, way before the end of the book) you're rooting for the characters, and feel emotionally moved at times (also something that does not usually happen to me!). I've recommended this book to my book club as well as several friends -- and am hoping they love it as much as I do."
5,Absolutely PRICELESS!,"What a gem of a little movie - something here for everyone. I LOVED IT!!!! One of those times where you just know you will watch a movie over and over again and never really catch it all - fresh every time. It hit me like a ton of bricks! Vive la France, and cowboy, indian, horse and his ladylove too!"
5,Laugh-out-loud funny...,"This movie is downright hilarious. I think the fact that it's in French makes it even funnier. I love the characters and the fact that most of them are called what they are, i.e. Horse, Cowboy, Indian. The hijinks that ensue are non-stop. My little sister and I couldn't stop laughing - she's 23, I'm 28. The adventure that the main characters go on keeps you interested, and normal things these toys do like surf the web or drink and party will make you shake your head and ask yourself, ""What the heck am I watching?"" But it's all good. I wasn't sure what to expect when we first started watching because it seemed totally random. This movie has a sweet ending, and the whole thing is a barrel of laughs. If you are looking for something funny and strangely entertaining...this is it. You'll want to watch it again and again."
3,Silly,"I used this film to listen to French so I can practice. Much of the dialogue is a bit fast or mumbled, fine if you speak the language well. It's a light film, claymation, subtitled and silly. My son and daughter in law love it, and it's very popular among their age group. The silly part is what they adore!"
4,Serious weirdness,"But I mean that in a good way. The animation style tends self-consciously towards the unpolished - but the stiff, jerky motions perfectly suit the sense that these characters could have been plastic toys, right down to the little stand beneath their feet, in my own childhood toybox. The main characters, Cowboy (a cowboy), Indian (an Indian), and Horse (you guessed it) have an equally self-conscious feel about their characters' names.What really makes this strange little treat is its surreal meanderings from one improbable scene to another - the upside-down aquatic village, horses playing specially modified pianos, and even (spoiler) a battle fought using pigs and swordfish as projectiles. Of the little rational flow the creators left in this production, I probably missed a good portion. I watched without subtitles, but admit French to be among my many lacks. All the more reason to see it again!-- wiredweird"
5,Awesome! Not a waste of time at all.,I wasn't too excited about watching this film and I'm not interested in those particular types of toys or the color palette but this movie is GREAT. It absolutely decloaks Robot Chicken as computer animation disguised as time consuming stop motion. It even has thieving Murlocs from the other side of the world. Who could ask for anything more?
4,Gloriously hilarious,"Very simple, but dear god is this a delightful nugget of creative randomness. Simply marvelous and a joy to watch. It touches on that little spot in your imagination back when you didn't care that you had your Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles toys show up to help your G.I. Joes toys out of some crazy scheme thought up by your Skeletor toy"
4,great leaning tool,another way for the brain to take in knowledge. Work with the camera 1st as well stumble through the manual and the written aides. The dvd is a great compliment. jj
4,Very helpful and well arranged.,"The DVD was fantastic. The instruction was very well organized and it focused on the most important features of the camera. They didn't just talk about the D200, they talked about photography basics as well. If you're a pro it might not be the best DVD for you because they do spend a lot of time teaching techniques to taking better pictures using the D200"
3,The information is in the book,"The DVD was reasonably well done, but only presents the basic information on the camera. The D200 guides, including the one that comes with the camera, have more information in greater detail.One possible value of the DVD would be for someone considering purchasing the D200. It is a good presentation of the overall capabilities and functionality of the camera. (Would probably cause you to part with the extra money and buy the D200 in lieu of one of the basic models.)"
1,Too simplistic,All the information (and more) you can find in the manual included in your Nikon D200 camera box. Do not waste yor money and time.
2,Introduction to Nikon D200,Insted of going point to point his hends moved allover Camera. He should be presenting Nokon to beginers. That what introduction means. So everybody can understand. I am not impressed. Should be redone.
3,Great for Beginners - waste of money for advanced users,"I would rate this a 5 if you are brand new to digital photography -- but, oddly, the D200 is geared toward users who already have the basic knowledge of 90 percent of this DVD. There are a few things here and there that are interesting and allows you to quickly learn a few of the features if you don't want to bother reading the manual -- but the manual is free inside the box, the cost of this DVD does not make sense for anyone with intermediate to advanced digital camera skills."
4,Great for visually oriented people,"Okay, so this isn't the most comprehensive treatment of the D200 and some of the info is basic photography. But, photogs are by nature visual, and if you hate wading through the boring printed owners manual (like I did anyway), this DVD is a great way to get up and running with the camera. Some people learn and retain video better than print. It is well done and interesting. It is also the only intro to the D200 that addressed the need to establish a pre-shot routine to ensure all of the settings would work for the shot. Maybe advanced amateurs do this in their sleep, but a beginner like me needed someone to show me how to do this."
4,The Generations Speak...,"Do yourself a favor: Ignore the title. Force yourself to at least read the first chapter. That's what I did.Now, I don't know if it was some sort of male version of PMS or what, but I found myself against all logic continually moved with emotion. I was downright weepy at times-downright annoyed at others. It's embarrassing. Chris Seay, along with his brother Robbie, sat down for an extended conversation with his father and grandfather. All four are ""career"" ministers with very different philosophies of ministry. This book is nothing more than a transcript of that conversation, raw and mostly unedited. It is insightful, honest and a must read for anyone who wrestles with the ongoing tension between church and culture.Oh, and ""Papa"" definitely steals the show.Should you buy the book? You'll know the answer to that after reading chapter one."
3,Interesting but Shallow,"I read Faith of My Fathers because of the interesting premise of three generations of pastors sharing, via dialogue, diverse opinions on topics of relevance to today's culture. While it was interesting at times and an easy read there wasn't as much insight to be gained as promised.The book is mostly Seay's opinion, and he has the final word, on relevant topics with quips from the other members of his family. When there were disagreements the grandfather tended to quit talking and the father seemed to cave a lot to the tag team of Seay and his brother along with Donald Miller, making a guest appearance.The book didn't live up to its promise or potential. Ultimately, an interesting but shallow look at a family and how they deal with each other."
2,U b the judge,My son bought this computerin July 05. had the motherboard and hard drive replaced this past April 06. Now the Display has gone out (out of warrenty) and the tech told him it can not take the heat. Otherwise ok I guess.
1,Piece of Junk,"This is a piece of junk!!! It does not work at all. Save your money and get a different one. I could never get it to work. Thinking I needed a stronger pump, I purchased a much stronger one, it would get good suction but would still not clean."
1,Piece of Junk!,"Do not purchase this! It is a total waste of money! I do not think I have ever been so disapointed in a purchase. Thank goodness for these opinion polls here on Amazon, if I'd looked here 1st before making my purchase I wouldn't have flushed my money down the drain!"
4,Quirky Supergroup concept album,"I recently bought this CD. I owned the Vinal LP the week it came out. And although the whole Sci Fi musical deal doesn't seem quite as cool as it did to my teenage self in 1975, I have been singing some of the songs in my car or while doing outdoor activities for all these years. Alice Cooper in his prime doing ""I'm Flash"", Jim Dandy of Black Oak Arkansas doing ""Country Cooking"" Elkie Brooks doing ""Trapped"", John Entwistle playing bass throughout the album. If these folks would have got together for a serious outing it would be thought of as a classic rather than ""Quirky"".Avery pleasant surprise to me was ""What's Happening"" by James Dewer (of Robin Trower), one of the best ballads about unrequited love I can think of, with the great line ""If I try for all time you will never be mine, but I will always be yours""Although this album has slipped into obscurity over the years, if you feel like something fun and different, this is one to get and keep."
1,One of the better Confunkshun albums,"Spirit of love shows the collective strength of this very talented group and the strong lead vocals of Michael Vernon Cooper. Each song is melodic and personal, and keeps you moving. From the spirited ""Got to be enough"" to the soft ""All up to you."" An old school lesson in real music and a must have for funk music lovers of all ages."
5,Classic Balladry At Its Finest,"This cd brings back the days when music presented romantic innuendoes and actual feelings from the heart. Tunes such as ""All Up To You"", ""Honey Wild"" and ""Make It Last"" give that feeling ""love"" that is missing from today's slow songs. Although this cd is missing ""Can't Say Goodbye"", it is perfect for those romantic interludes or quiet evenings that only two can share. If you miss the days where artists didn't just sing for profit this is a definite add to your cd collection."
4,MISSING SOMETHING........,THESE GREATEST HITS ALBUMS SEEM TO ALWAYS LEAVE OFF TRUE GEMS. TRUE BLUE CON FUNK SHUN FANS WHO GO ALL THE WAY BACK (LIKE ME) WOULD GIVE THIS 5 STARS HAD THEY INCLUDED ANOTHER WORLD OR NEVER BE THE SAME (BOTH FROM THEIR FIRST ALBUM) OTHER THAN THAT NOT BAD AND STILL WORTH THE MONEY BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
5,Slow Jams At Their Finest,"Con Funk Shun was one of the baddest groups of the sevnties and this CD collection displays the group at their slow jam finest. The winning combo of Skip Scarbrough's writing and Michael Cooper's vocals really stand out on Love's Train, Straight From The Heart (my personal favorite),Baby I'm Hooked Right Into Your Love and Honey Wild. If you hear some real music and amazing slow jam pick this one up."
3,not what you'd expect,"these appear to be identical to another pair I bought from this company however this has zippers which can make it easier to take on and off. I'm not sure why but it says these are calf boots when they are the same length as knee high boots? is there a difference between the two? I thought calf boots came to the calf and knee boots came up to the knee. not much I can do about it now. and some thing else, it says leather but its a weird type of leather almost like leather you'd find on black sketchers or something. and that leather over time, bubbles up and tears off like plastics, not tradition combat leather, i.e. service boots. wonder how long these will last, time will tell I guess."
4,Seems to be a good product.,So far I like the product. The taste is very tart(which I like)so be warned if you do not like tart tasting things.
5,Great for leg cramps at night.,"My fiance uses this nightly for leg cramps and restless legs at night. Tried many other products, always come back to this one."
3,Ionic fizz,"We have been using this product for over a year now and it appears to be working to a degree. However the price has gone up over 60 percent since we bought the first cans, about $22.00 each. So we are gradually introducing a substitute magnesium source that is about one third the cost! This company is going to lose a lot of business if it does not get it's pricing under control."
2,taste awful,Bought this product at Whole Foods looking for ionic available magnesium. The taste is awful. It made me ill. There was so much vit c that it is very acidic and should be called Vit C plus.
1,"Buyer Beware of ""Dr."" David Jernigan and his claims...","This guy, Dr. David Jernigan, advertises like a new age snake oil salesman. I wouldn't put my health in the hands of a multi-level marketer who leads people to believe he is a Medical Doctor...he is not and MD, he is a chiropractor making and selling his own products. When his self made expensive ""products"" fail very seriously ill lyme patients, he blames them, accusing them of being negative and blaming them for their lack of spirituality. Beware of his sales people as ""cured"" patients.He also lurks on lyme disease patient forums to see what they say about his treatments/products and when they are not getting well, again he blames them. Don't fall for this - there are plenty of reputable alternatives to treat chronic lyme disease.[...]"
5,YUM!,"Why in the world can't I buy this in my local grocery anymore? I don't know the answer, but I thank Amazon for still selling it. Add a little Cholula and it's a delicious meal."
5,Excellent,"So lyrical, so flowing. I see that all of the previous reviewers have given this an unequivocal thumbs up. It's certainly worth it. Rarely has such a heavy composer been treated with such a lightness of touch. The strings sound positively jaunty.My one one fault with the release is the lack of a fill-up, but then perhaps anything else could not reach the same standard.It's a pity that Kleiber records so infrequently, but that may be why he conducts so well when he does."
3,Somethings Missing!,"As I write this, there are 31 reviews ahead of me, all of them exuberant on Kleiber's interpretation. I cannot contest that. I must assume that all, or most, of the reviewers have listened to the music with the score in hand or have listened to 8 or 10 conductors who have read this music. Theres hardly any mention of the sound quality of the recording, except one reviewer who says it is an early digital. The Penguin Guide - which I read after buying the CD from Amazon - puts it way down among the recommended recordings, noting that while any Kleiber recording is an event of stature, it admits that this early digital exposes its technical limitations - ""shrill and glassy"" sounds above the stave. I have many DG Originals with outstanding sound and outstanding performances. This disk is a great disappointment, even after hearing it several times. It certainly shouldnt be the beginner's first choice!"
5,WOA!!!,"Its perfect, its does what is suppose to do, extract the surface of the water, doing this, you could keep the surface out of garbage, like ""oil"" look, it have a thing that could ""shut"" the extractor, that's intended when you feed the fish."
5,BREATHTAKING BUT FIERCE!,"This collection of BBC Sessions is absolutely essential! Songs from both albums and the singles are portrayed here along with two non-LP tracks, ""Monogamy"" and ""Ideal Woman"", two of their best songs hands down.Don't miss out on a chance to hear the band which defined the equality of the sexes and poked fun at the foolishness of modern day romance."
4,I've seen worse ;-),I like my phone! And it's ok that I can't text message out...I do wish I could use the browser instead of having to download a now one.
2,TEXT MESSAGE WHERE ARE U,"This phone has good palm/outlook compatibility, but its e-mail and text messaging system SUCKS. I recently called Sprint to see whether I can send or receive either e-mails or text messaging. They said I could surf the web to find other third-party software to download and blahh blahh blahh. I am not a techie and would probably mess it up if I fumbled through the web in search of something that might be compatible with my phone. For $600, I expected much more than this. Sprint stinks - stick with AT&T or Verizon if you want a smart phone. Sprint is deceptive."
4,Frustrating good,"This is a phone/PDA. It is NOT a camera, MP3 player or any of the other things that some people seem to want today. It is old Palm technology but it is still useful Palm technology. I never thought I would use a handheld to browse the web but there are a surprising number of site enabled to handle the small screen. The great thing about convergence is that I only have to keep my phone numbers in 1 place. There are a few annoyances such as no NIB support for text messaging and no expansion slot. Which is frustrating because everything else is so well done. One word of warning, you will need both of the batteries that come with the phone because this device is so darn useful that you will be using it for non-phone stuff so much and you won't get near the advertised battery time"
2,A sorry Mac user,"I don't know why mac users would bother buying this phone. It was an expensive mistake on my part. Why would it matter if, after jumping through hoops, you can get the thing to sync up to palm desktop, when all your data is on custom mac software that needs isync for synchronization. Save yourselves the pain and go with an Ericsson. Furthermore - I am personally done with the wires."
1,Good antique item,"Let's face it. 66MHz CPU, Palm OS 4, 4096 colors.This is an old technology you should have already thrown out.You don't want to buy it for next few years by spending $600.Even if someone is trying to give it to me free, I would refuse.These days if you want a PDA with phone, it has to be at least200MHz, so that it may run the map applications properly(not simply static map image viewer - I mean, zoom in, zoom out,pan operations). Also, playing mp3 (with 66MHz cpu ?),picture viewing (your family photos - with 4096 colors ?)This Samsung I500 can be a good antique item at this momentthough."
1,PDA but no Communications,"Slow Inet Acess. Can read emails, but no way to respond. Simply a contact DBase. Inet is slow. Buy a Treo. Sprint sucks w/ this technology. Tried so many times to make this work. If you have nothing to do, give another try......As always you might get moisture damage..."
4,Missing a key element,"Best phone I've owned in terms of general funcationality.The biggest shortcoming, though, is the lack of speakerphone. This is significant since the phone is also my PDA.At first I did not think it was a big deal, but I keep running into the following scenario: Someone calls and asked ""Are you available at [fill in the blank]"". or ""Do you have [fill in the blank]'s phone number?"".It is impossible to talk and use the PDA at the same time. I have tried workaround such as earjacks, but for me (who would only use the earjacks if I needed to use the PDA and talk) they take too long to plug in.I heard that Verizon has a phone almost identical to this, but with speakerphone; I am seriously considering moving over."
1,Waste of time,"This book was a waste of time and money and I would not recommend it to anyone. I found the main character to be weak and whiny. I was looking for strong examples to pattern my life after, and this book was exactly the opposite. very disappointing."
1,Worst PDA I've ever bought,"Very awkward to change the SIM or miniSD card or battery, and the control buttons are in non-intuitive places. Low-end cover and accessories, and the GPS isn't a real one, it requires an unlimited data subscription with the phone company ($40/month) plus a subscription with the GPS provider (also not accurate location). If GPS is turned on, the battery gets discharged in 20 minutes. Bottom line: this is a piece of junk!"
5,Phenomenal,"This movie is an honest look at trauma and war. The actors do an amazing job portraying the complexities of just how painful processing trauma, war, and loss can be. So very good. By far, Colin Farrell's best performance."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"There are many better movies that fit into this genre out there. Yes, war is hell, but so is bad acting and writing."
4,Tom Hanks Comedy Favorites Collection,I forgot how funny Tom Hanks was back in the day. The money pit and the burbs are classic Hanks. Plenty of laughs and Dan Aykroyd is hilarious in Dragnet. Well worth the price for these classics. The only drawback is the quality is a little grainy.
4,tom hanks comedy favourites,I never much liked DRAGNET but i bought the package because i love the BURBS and the MONEY PIT.Tom Hanks has a special way of doing comedy and i think he is just awesome
3,tom hanks early comedy,"i wasnt a huge fan of money pit, i gotta kick outta dragnet, and i love the burbs. if all you know about tom hanks film is post saving private ryan, then you need to see his earlier work. he truly shines in light comedies. plus its clear when you watch his late 80's early 90's work, how he got to where he is today. i gave three stars. it wasnt breathtaking or fantastic in an epic manner, but they're light hearted and fun films."
1,What are they trying to pull?????,"I just recently bought this product and disc one is fine!!! BUT HERE'S THE KICKER disc two is disc two of the Steve Martin comedy collection with dead men don't wear plaid and the lonely guy. I thought it might just be a localized incident, But a few weeks ago my friend bought the same product at Best Buy and his product was packaged the same way!!! Where are the our disc number two??????"
4,Cute package,I bought this for my Boss. He is renovating his house and has never seen the Money Pit. Classic movie!
3,Cheap movies.,"The Money Pit was much more predictable than I had hoped it would be. I'm not a film critic, but anyone who has actually remodeled a house could have come up with a lot funnier and lot more bizarre scenarios with all that house had to offer. The other two flicks were OK, but I watched all of them once and have very little desire to see them again."
1,Missing Disk,I purchased this item and when I got around to watching it one of the disks was missing. Must check package when received.
5,"Sweet and funny, a great read","This was a great book! It was so nice to read something that makes you laugh out loud and feel good. The characters were relatable and charming, and the love story sweet, but not mushy. A good read for both guys and girls, especially ones with Greek or Italian relatives."
2,Too restrictive and uncomfortable,This product certainly does control buldge but try to breath and you are in trouble. The product seemed well made but the design is much too restrictive. I ordered a medium (I usually wear a small) and I could not wear it.
1,Does not deliver what is promised.,"This book, as I understood it, was to have provided new insight to the horrors of The War Between the States as seen through the eyes of children, both North and South. In my humble opinion it is only a poorly researched work based on readily available letters written by Federal soldiers and classic Southern diaries. Small passages from well known sources are intermingled with the authors' personal views that seem to twist the story into glorification of the Federal army and not necessarily what was witnessed by children. There is nothing to really educate or even entertain the average reader of WBTS history. In a nut shell it is old news with a Northern slant."
5,Rudi Movie review,"How wonderful it was to see the pictures of this truly extraordinary and beloved spiritual teacher who departed this life far too early.It should be noted that Rudi's guru was, in fact, Bhagawan Nityananda. The DVD does not make this clear. Rudi was initiated by Nityananda, and Rudi and Muktananda were brother disciples.When Bhagavan Nityananda took mahasamadhi within a year or two of Rudi's initial meeting, Rudi chose to become affiliated with Muktananda, primarily to gain access to Nityananda's shrine in Ganeshpuri. Rudi officially broke ties with Muktananda in 1971."
2,Rough Road!,"For a long awaited, monumental study of the South's road to disunion, you had best keep waiting. This is one tough read. There is good history here but this author is very complicated and has a hard time saying just what is on his mind. Was the story really this complex? Yes, it really was. But is it necessary to make a complex series of events murky and unclear? I don't think so. Freehling is a good historian but this is a far cry from his finest effort."
2,Is it about Chrono Trigger?,"Im looking for new animes to watch and is this about The Snes and Ps Game ""Chono Trigger""?Give info please"
4,great,"great oem replacement. went in perfect fit nice sounds and looks good..only issue i had was they packaged it with wet paint. and it had a sticker on the header that said ""product is painted with no high temp paint"" seriously why would you paint a header that gets HOT woth NON HIGH TEMP paint???? had it sandblasted and ceramic powder coated for $150 at a local powder coater.. other than that i love it."
3,Boring book,"Not a bad book but a little boring. Good resource if you don't have time to study, but it is boring so you have to effort to read it."
1,Art Explosion Religious Clip,"This is a case of bait and switch. Art Explosion Holiday Clip Art is shipped in place of the advertised (and illustrated)""Art Explosion Religious Clip"" One receives Santa and the Easter Bunny images; instead of clip are suitable for Bible related publications.Retired"
3,not as refined as I was looking for,"It's hard to find refined Christian clip-art & I don't see that this is that. It's basic clip-art from years ago. If you're looking for fine and beautiful Christian clip-art, this product is NOT it."
4,Lots and lots of clip art!,"Thousands and thousands of religious clip art! Always could use more photos, though. But a lot--a whole lot--of pictures for the price."
4,Small Mesh Stacking Crate,"Thank you for sending me the Small mesh stacking crate. I didn't use it for my CD's, I used it for something different. I found another great idea to use it for. I put 2 small mesh stacking crates in my bathrooms.It was great for putting paper towels and napkins in for my guest to dry their hands. It went well with the decor in my bathrooms. I use the silver color instead of the black color. What a great way to use the product.Thank you"
2,Near Miss,"Turco's book could just as well have been titled ""All About Me."" Psychiatrists and their brethren apparently cannot resist centering on the aches and pains of their profession, while the work they do and how they do it takes a poor second. If you are interested in his struggles -childhood, domestic, soul - this is the book for you. If you are interested in psychological profiling, perhaps now that Dr. Turco has gotten so much off his chest he will write that book."
3,Hot Fax,"I called Smith Micro customer support when my demo version was restored on my computer and my purchased full version vanished. I called their customer service, it is horrible, or should I say ""Customer NO Service"" since there is none. They me to call another number ""didn't work"". I called the main number for service and find I need an access number. Bottom line, I paid for a fax software which I downloaded and they didn't send me a disk. They turned on the demo and that now doesn't work. All my files are stored on the demo version where I can't get to them. I'd be glad for Hot fax support to e-mail me a solution. If they don't support this, why do they build and sell such software, and who will buy that?If you are thinking to buy it and will need support sometime down the road, forget it, give it up and look for something else."
1,NO STAR AL ALL,"If you are planning to buy this softwar, and have WINDOWS XP, forget it. You will cry. I had Windows ME, it worked, but now I upgraded to XP, and guess what, it doesn't work at all. They said it will work with any windows 9X OS, but it doesn't. I called them, their customer service is horrible. You know what they said to me was that my modem US Robotics V.90 doesn't support their (product). If V.90 doesn't support this, why do they build such software, and who will buy that?If you are thinking to buy it, give it up and look for something else."
1,Appalling experience!,"After much research and what I thought was careful planning, I downloaded the software and found it would not work with my computer. To make it work would require a new modem for around $300.00. Tried to contact Smith Micro and they were ""on holiday"". Unfortunately, the time frame to return product expired while they were ""on holiday"" and they said it was too bad for me. Terrible customer service and I encourage people to do business with another company entirely."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"This software was a waste of time and money for me, as it does not function unless you already have a voice mail system in place with specific drivers. I already have fax capabilities in my computer, so this software was unnecessary and useless."
2,"unreliable software, looking for a replacement","I have been using the 4.0 version of this software on a Windows 98 platform for several years, with disappointing results. The fax does not work well when it comes to sending file attachments, sometimes resulting in annoying crashes. Logging the sent or received faxes is a big problem, as the fax viewer cannot open the faxes stored in a default directory that cannot be changed. Very recently I updated my Windows 98 with all the critical updates from Microsoft, and HotFax crashes the computer (very reliably!) every time I try sending a fax. Don't buy this product, find something better."
5,Great Product,"This product will SAVE any small business a thousand or more dollars by using a computer and software rather than purchasing an expensive voice mail system. BRAVO to Smith Micro!BTW, I purchased an early version (2.0) years ago, and it was very good then. I can't wait to start using 5.0!"
2,"Not entertaining, funny, or dramatic","The movie wasn't really bad, but it was bad enough that I couldn't take it and turned it off before it was over (and I rented the movie). It was very slow and was not believable. Some movies are like that but are still good, but they make up for the negatives with genuine drama or special effects or something. The acting was good, I can say that. I like Luke Wilson. He was outstanding in The Marvelous Tenenbaums. I'm very surprised this film got a high overall rating. The fact that the rating was so high for THIS movie makes me distrust customer ratings on Amazon for any other movie."
2,Boring,"The ""evidence for faith"" was silly, and the story moved so slowly I fell asleep less than half-way into it. Too boring to replay. Maybe it ended well?"
4,Heartwarming Low Key Story,"I hesitate to say too much on movie reviews,I personally hate spoilers when people write,but here goes....I was attracted to this movie because I enjoy the work of several of the people in the fine cast.It's a very low key kinda sad,but at times hopeful art house kinda movie.No car chases or explosions or nudity, a fine movie for the whole family but that doesn't mean boring, It has a very positive hopeful message and I enjoyed it.I live out in CA and it seems like every couple years there is some wall that is discovered by the hopeful that seems to have a holy image on it that they all end up praying to and it ends up on the TV news out here.This ends up being Henry Poole's New house!The movie is very thoughtful and doesn't make a mean caricature out of the hopeful people,the way some movies have done for cheap tasteless laughs ""Santa Maria!""I liked this movie"
3,A NICE SURPRISE! 3 1/2 STARS!,"The film was not quite what I expected, but that is not a bad thing. This little Indie film is thought provoking and full of interesting characters, but I wanted a little more out of it. Please don't let that stop you from watching this very enjoyable film!....it's well worth seeing."
4,Better than I thought,"I've enjoyed Luke Wilson since Bottle Rocket, and while his movie career hasn't been awful, it certainly has had a number of misfires. Here, he does some of his best work as an alcoholic living out his last days. He buys a house to live alone, and his religious neighbor finds a ""miracle"" on his back wall and his house becomes the center of attention. I didn't think I would be sold on the premise, but the movie made it work. There are some good performances in this one, especially from Wilson and Radha Mitchell. The DVD is a little light on extras, so you may just want to rent this one if you're interested."
4,"Sweet, uplifting family movie","Henry Poole is a man with a secret and a sad future. He returns to the only place where he was ever happy, his childhood neighborhood. He wants to be left alone, but his noisy neighbors won't do that.A water stain appears on his house that some call a holy image. Henry does not believe, and has hoards of believers to cope with, disturbing the isolation he seeks.In the end Henry finds faith, love and a kind of healing. This is a sweet, feel-good movie, suitable for the whole family, although it is rated PG for language and some themes."
3,Entertaining,"Despite the weak storyline and predictable dialogue, it is the constantly curious plot and amazing cast performance (in spite of their obstacles) that keeps you mildly amused. While not as inspirational as Roger Ebert would have you believe, it is still a curiously entertaining feel-good film that should leave you smiling. The audio commentary by Director Mark Pellington reveals just how large a film can seem on such a small location and budget."

3,Henry Poole Is Here,"Interesting Movie with a good Moral back ground. Henry does not seem to truely accept God, but has some feeling that something devine or a mirical did occur. His logic or empirical beliefs still give him some doubt."
2,okaaay...,"No idea what this movie was supposed to make me think. It was so weird that I don't even know how to describe it.All I can say: the plot was predictable. Like three minutes in and I already knew what was going to happen. And yet it was really weird. I mean, what was the point? Totally strange...I would not suggest this movie."
2,A cinematic shaggy dog,"Luke Wilson's performance alone is almost worth the time spent viewing this film. Almost. Sadly, that's about it.The predictability of the story line is appalling. The ""message"" is a mish-mosh of faith versus agnosticism with an underlying current of mystery, i.e., What was the terrible secret of his childhood? Omigosh. Oh, no! His parents argued!! G-o-l-l-y! No wonder he is so unhappy. Me, too -- but that's because I just spent 99 minutes watching this thing.Incidentally, did anyone notice that, although his name does not appear anywhere on the DVD case, Richard Benjamin plays the doctor -- or should we say ""the shaggy dog""? That is too sad!"
1,Dumb!,My husband and I watched this movie and we both thought it was long and boring. I fell asleep a couple of times.
1,Boring Boring Boring,"This is just a warning do not buy this movie to watch Luke Wilson. It's possibly the most boring movie I've ever seen. I myself have suffered from depression but that didn't make me care about his character much. I like a lot of slow little independent movies, this one sucks."
1,Long and boring,"I watched this movie with a few friends, and it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story moves so slowly and it has a 100% script-o-matic ending which you can predict from about 10 seconds after the movie starts. The only reason I kept watching this movie is because part of me was really hoping to see Ashon Kutcher pop out at the end and shout: ""You've been Punked!"". Sadly this was not the case, instead it follows the direct arrow of a plotline from where it began and Henry Poole finds Jesus and is magically cured of ""fatal illness"". Luke Wilson however plays an excellent skeptic but as soon as he turns to believer, all of the acting magic is gone.All in all it feels like someone just forced out a formulaic feel good movie and added in a little Jesus so it would make it's numbers."
3,effective despite paint by numbers script,"Luke Wilson is a likeable actor and makes a decent everyman. Here he is awash in a mororse tale of self pity and does a good job conveying this without too much overacting etc.. The scenery is overloaded with pale pastel suburbs and empty interiors which made me as a viewer want to runaway, but after opening up to what was being offered I was able to take something away from this overly melancholic and lightly theological tale. A few less tearjerker songs on the soundtrack and few more odd twists of dialogue and plot and this movie would have won me over even more. But as it stands it left a hollower feeling in me than I think the filmmakers intended."
2,I missed something on this one.,"I really, really wanted to like Henry Poole. I tried, really, really hard. It just didn't work for me. It felt artificially ""arty"" and contrived, and utterly formulaic. A threadbare (but not bad) idea stretched out endlessly (or so it felt). It's a talented cast, a decent story, but for me none of the elements coalesced into a whole, unnecessarily lending the performances by the actors a ""Hush, I'm acting over here"" kind of self-importance that a genuine ensemble film can't withstand.I'm open minded, however, and in reading enough positive (some very much so) reviews on this little film, I may give it another choice. Sometimes attitude, mood, timing and other ""outside"" elements can affect how we see things (sometimes?) and I DID want to like this. We'll see. We'll see."
2,A rather corny movie,"This is unrealistic and quite predictable. The guy in them movie was rather depressed and wanted to be left alone, yet complete strangers/neighbors went out of their way to help him. I doubt this would happen in east LA where people tend to keep to themselves especially when new (weirdo's) move in next door.I didn't think the acting was all that dynamic and the love story aspect was not developed to its full potential. It tried to be a comedy at times, but I didn't find it humorous. It may be a great inspiration to those who believe in miracles, but I didn't fall for it.About 1/2 way thru the movie the sound track was delayed slightly from the video and was even more difficult to watch.The 2 page note from director Mark Pellington included in the DVD was rather touching and gives you his perspective on the movie."
5,awesome movie,"This movie is one of the best I've ever seen ... it is a story that slowly sneaks up on you and grabs and shakes you!!! It will touch your soul and you'll leave feeling a tremendous sense of delight!!!The acting is awesome and the photography work is superb!!! The story is well ... don't want to spoil the story line for you ... you'll have to discover it for yourself, and that is half the fun!!!Hope you enjoy this flick as much as I did!!!"
4,"Slow starting, but Worth Watching","Luke Wilson has played a lot of ditsy characters lately, so I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. This isn't really a comedy or a drama. It's somewhere in between. Luke Wilson does a good job of being serious in this movie. The acting is genuinely great in this movie. The only thing that detracted from the movie for me was how slow moving it was at the beginning.Being from L.A., this movie is very genuine in its depiction of the Southern California lifestyle--the one that most people don't see. I think most people think L.A. is either like Compton or like Beverly Hills. But, most of it is really somewhere in between--like it is in this movie.I'd recommend this movie. It's worth watching and it's definitely better than Luke Wilson's last few films."
5,Better than I expected,"I hadnt heard much about this movie, except it had Luke Wilson in it. I decided to give it a try. Heading into the almost empty theater, I left pleased. It starts us with Luke Wilson buying a house and not caring about the price because he ""wont be here very long anyway."" We dont understand that at first. A few neighbors come by to check on him, and his realtor Cheryl Hines even shows up to tell him about repairs, which again he doesnt care because he wont be there for long. It is the beautiful next door neighbors daughter that will finally bring him out of his shell, bring his troubles and concerns to the surface and admit to his past pain. It is a brilliant film that while it does mix some with religion it doesnt create itself as the main point of the film. All of the actors did a great job, including his nosy next door neighbor that refuses to leave him alone!"
1,Nothing Here,"After reading this book, I can understand the negative reviews. There is nothing particularly interesting about either the author or his alleged story. While Mr. Thompson may have had a great time playing ""undercover reporter"", the reader will find this book to be far less than enjoyable. This bland little tale merely proves than almost anyone can be published, and is useful only as a cure for insomnia."
1,Ku-Klunk!,"Journalist Jerry Thompson set out in search of a story on the modern-day Klan. He didn't find one, but somehow managed to foist his non-story upon a gullible publisher anyway. Thompson tries to convince readers that he was in some sort of ""danger"" while on his ""undercover"" mission, but fails miserably. His threadbare ""expose'"" reveals that the Klan is a pathetically small, virtually powerless group of misfits and fanatics (which we knew), and that David Duke uses racial slurs (no surprise there, either). In other words, Thompson simply wasted his time, and attempts to waste the reader's time as well. Jerry Thompson is no Stetson Kennedy - this book is pure junk!"
1,What a dud!,"Add me to the list of readers who couldn't find any redeeming value in this sorry excuse for a book. Mr. Thompson had nothing of value to say, but somehow managed to have this slice of tripe published. Thompson should have admitted that there was no story, returned to his newspaper, and found a more worthwhile project; instead, he wasted his time, his employer's time and money, and the time of the reader. Mr. Thompson should be profoundly ashamed of this steaming heap of trash."
2,"Not much story, but stills tells us something","The critique of this book that it has no real story, is solid. Thompson merely flirted with the Klan, found nothing new out, and talks mostly about finding apartments and building cabinets. HOWEVER, the most interesting thing is the fact that the Klan he found in the ""hotbed"" of Klan activity in Alabama (the US even) was disorganized and almost nonexistent. This is what he should have been talking about. He should have written about how the Klan in popular consciousness is a large, ever-present organization. I get this opinion from classmates who are afraid to move to rural areas, for fear of ""the Klan."" When in fact the Klan is a much smaller organization with little power anymore, save the power to draw media attention. The name still has power, but that is all that has power anymore. I wish Thompson would have taken this fact and turned it back on the media to show their baseless sensationalism and irrational fears for what they are."
3,Chicken Soup for Catholics,"If you like the Chicken Soup books or William Bennett's Book of Virtues then you will enjoy Our Sunday Visitor's Treasury of Catholic Stories.These are stories to be read to our children and cherished. Many are familiar; others are not. Readers will find stories on St. Francis of Assisi, St. Patrick, Dorothy Day, and Cardinal Bernardin.Each of the 125 stories serves to illustrate a specific Catholic teaching such as the cardinal virtues, the Gifts of the Holy Spirit, or the corporal and spiritual works of mercy.If you are attempting to teach the faith to your children this book belongs on your mantle."
5,Love Jones...,"An interesting mix of ""slow jams."" For me, the best song on the collection is ""Dedicate (My life to you) by the Younghearts. It clocks in at 7:45, worth the price of the CD alone. Tunes that I particulary like are the Ohio Players - I want to be free, Brighter Side of Darkness - Love Jones, and Make it Last - ConFunkShun.Don't get wrong folks, it's a great disk, I just would advise you to wait until you can find it at domestic (like I did). So be patient, and maybe you'll get lucky. Five Stars!"
3,$45.00 is too expensive for a used CD,"Why are you charging so much for a used CD with only vol.2, if I pay $45.00 for a used CD, I want Vols. 1, 2, 3, and 4. This price of $45.00 is a rip off."
5,Excellent!,"Without doubt the best book I've read on goal setting, and a whole range of other areas as well. Perfect timing for me in both my business and personal lives."
5,Great book by Tracy,"I think most people underestimate the value of goals. Most people know about goals, but how many people actually have written goals?In this book, Brian Tracy offers a powerful program on how to set and reach your goals and in record time."
5,Making Goals that Work,"I have read a lot of Goal books and if you have read a couple you know they are similar, but of all of them, I LOVE Brian Tracy's Goals! and have read it more than once. His writing style speaks volumes and whenever I finish one of his books I feel ready to conquer any and all my goals."
1,This review is for the audiobook,"Most of the content is great, albeit Mr. Tracy seems to have a hyper-ambition about how much money one earns. Unfortunately, I had a hard time listening to Mr. Tracy's delivery of the material; it is very monotone and dry. If he could add some humor and excitement into his delivery, listening to the audiobook would be a much more pleasurable experience."
4,Awesome!,I've always had a huge challenge in setting goals and read all kinds of books on the subject. Brian Tracy is the master in sales and goal setting. You'll love it. Easy to read and enjoyable style.
3,Too many words to say what needs to be said,"I actually like this book, and recommend it highly to anyone feeling like they need to set goals. The problem I have with this book is that Tracy spends a lot of time saying some very simple things like how our view of ourselves are often wrong. I also notice that when Tracy writes about goals he assumes that everyone has a goal of increasing their income. Granted, we could probably all find a use for more money whether for ourselves or to help others, but the assumption isn't necessarily true and I find it occassionally distracting while reading. He makes statements about us obviously having goals to make more money when in actuality many may just want to have more friends, be healthier, etc. In fact, a balanced approach is far better for us anyway. Tracy tends to have a biased approach toward making more money, probably based on his years as a salesman in search of a quota."
5,Finally! A group of guys with TRUE TALENT!,I have to say that this CD really thrilled me! It is absolutely amazing what the human voice can accomplish when it is being used by someone with talent. This CD is incredible! The guys in this group are going to go extremely far so I suggest you get this CD so that you'll be prepared for their (hopefully soon) US debut!
5,superb and great..sound....!,"having received recently both ""the wall"" and this dvd i will conclude both are amazing dvd and are ""must have"" dvd.i simply regret that this dvd has not the same 5.1 quality of mixing than ""the wall ""Sound is superb nevertheless"
5,A genuine group,"Genesis has remained a group, in the most accurate definition of the word. Their unique history together and interesting story-songs, place Genesis into a world all their own, never to be equaled again. It's too bad they are officially no longer together. This concert (like previous Genesis shows) is awesome. Genesis has always put on ""true"" shows for the audience's entertainment."
1,Don't buy from them,"I would love to say it's great, BUT 31 days later I have never recieved it, nor have I heard from either company after 3 e-mails. They sure do get your money fast tho. Do yourself a favor and buy it from someone else, someone who cares about their customers"
1,rock legend gone bad,"Genesis in 1976 put out a ""Genesis in Concert"" laser disc which I imagine is a DVD. This show is far better than this DVD. The medley did more to make the songs that made Genesis a rock band into one pathectic collage. Do not get this DVD as it is a waste of money."
3,The Last Hoorah,Had I known this would be the last time Phil would play with the band I would have gotten better seats for the show but the video does offer great angles and crane shots the Jim Yuckich has perfected in filming the band. Not quite a crisp as the Invisible Touch concert video. But never-the-less a keeper for any true Genesis fan.
3,The Sound is recorded badly!,Great show with a great line up but....the sound is terrible. Go out and get Live at Wembley. It's too bad it sounds bad because it has a better line up than Wembley. Listen to them both in DTS if possible and you will hear the difference. Overall excellent band with a bad DVD sound mix.
5,The superlative Kashmir Shaivist school of nondual awareness,"Ancient Kashmir was a source for both Buddhist and Hindu spirituality and learning. Many of the metaphors of the nondual awareness school were handed down to our present day through generations of mystics and scholars and provide an extraordinarily rich source for meditative expansion and stabilization. The root guru of Adi Da Samraj was Swami Muktananda, who in turn was a product of the Kashmir Shaivist school of nondual awareness. The richness of the terminology, derived from the ancient Sanskrit, is remarkable for both it's clarity and depth. These teachings are readily accessible in meditative absorption, and are a wonderful adjunct in the development, expansion, and assimilation of transcendental awareness."
5,Science and Spirituality meet,"Yoga is the greatest science. Yogis knew long before the West was on the map. Today, all sciences are still lagging behind. The stories that Yogies tell seem simple but a profound knowledge and treasures are hidden in them. the 'Doctrine of Vibration' lets you peak into a vast field of possibilities."
4,Solid little Clarinet bag,"I got this bag for my daughter who decided it was nerdy to carry around a tradition black molded plastic clarinet case. She loved the sporty design and variety of colors, and I like that it is solid and protects the horn very nicely.The only draw backis that the pockets on the front, aren't very spacious, but it has just enough room for her to keep all of her reeds, cleaners, sticks, cork grease etc.Overall, a great purchase!"
5,Great CD!,"These guys know how to ROCK! All of the songs are hard rock (and if you think Let It Out is slow at the begining, just wait)and full of great guitar chords. If you love hard rock, then pick this CD up! (Also, don't press any buttons after hearing track 11, and you'll hear a very cool instrumental song. You may think the CD is skipping at first, but it isn't)"
5,Pillar is the REAL DEAL!,"I too was wondering if WDWGFH could possible top ""Fireproof"". I'm not a huge ""rap-core"" fan, but ""Fireproof"" was an exception.I had heard ""Bring Me Down"" when I picked up ""Broken Down"" and immediately loved it. It gave me high hopes for WDWGFH. It did not let me down!I'm not going to review each track one by one. My favorites are Frontline, Underneath it All, Dirty Little Secret. They are true, in your face ROCK AND ROLL!. Heck, Dirty Little Secret even has a GUITAR SOLO! Something missing from today's rock and roll.I know some are going to criticize it because it is not as ""Christian"" as Above and Fireproof. But let me tell you this, there is no doubt that Pillar ""lives out loud"" for Jesus Christ! WDWGFH will allow them to break further into the mainstream to spread that message!Oh, and by the way...I'm a 41 year old father of two, so this music is not only for younger people."
4,"good, for a christian band!","This cd rocks, no preaching, just in your face good hard rock music. This is a breath of fresh air to an otherwise dying christian rock form. Pillar definately stands out."
2,Neither here nor there,"I will probably get blazed for this but I think this CD is overrated. Great production quality, excellent sound, but the development of the themes and emotional depth was lacking from what I expected. I would have liked more thought-out lyrics. I think these guys carry more power live."
4,A job well done!,"I took a liking of Christian Hard Rock back when this came out. Even though I'm an agnostic, I still think that the songs on this album do the trick of making the crowd go wild. Pillar is quite possibly one of the greatest Christian Hard Rock bands of this generation. The songs, ranging from wild & heavy to soft & mellow, show that these musicians know how to make some great music. My favorite songs here are ""Bring Me Down,"" ""Simply,"" and ""Rewind."" ""Rewind"" is my top favorite, because it has a very beautiful melody.This is actually 4-and-a-half stars out of 5, mainly because the songs ""Holding On"" and ""Dirty Little Secret"" aren't as good as the other songs on Where Do We Go From Here."
4,Great Album,"I'm not Christian, in fact I don't believe in religion, but this is a very good album, with some catchy songs, good lyrics and musically good. A couple of songs I skip, but otherwise great."
5,This is a great CD....,"Pillar's new CD is excellent. If you liked Pillar in the past you will love this CD but the CD also has a new sound that even new fans can enjoy. I like the heavy rifts you hear and the lyrics are much more powerful than their old songs. I enjoy this CD a lot and it is one that I personally would recommend for any old fan and for people who like heavier sounding music. Yet, this is not as heavy as Pillars old stuff. But just as powerful if not more powerful."
5,Incredible Album!,"Unbelievably good album from beginning right on through! Pillar seems to add a whole new dimension to their music compared to Fireproof. This album ranks among the top Christian rock albums in memory. Great job, Pillar!"
5,Excellent CD with a great price,"This CD arrived on time and in perfect condition, and it was very well priced."
4,pillar,i enjoy heavy metal christian music so i very much enjoy this album. i have another of theirs from earlier in their career. here's to many more years!
4,the bomb,"Once again, Pillar comes out with a hit- and boy, do they hit...If their ""Fireproof"" CD wasn't their best, this definitely is.From the beginning to the end, Pillar delivers again. A definite recommendation for fans of Linkin Park and 12 Stones."
5,Simply Rocks!,"Pillar has evolved since ""Fireproof"" and this disc is a solid rock effort instead of a rap/rock hybrid. These guys are not only talented, but they put their faith right out front without ever sounding ""preachy"". Lester Estelle is one of the most talented drummers you'll ever hear (or see for that matter)and Noah's guitar work is driving and relentless. Don't worry whether or not Pillar is ""hard enough"" or ""fast enough"". It's not a band's sound that shows their talent, it's their lyrics and playing and this cd is packed with both. Pillar simply ROCKS!"
5,hard rock at its best!,"I dont care if there christian this band f-ing rules!From the attention grabbing hypnotized to the explosive aftershock this album will come up to you and kick your face in.It kills me to see people not buy this album becuase there a christian band. well, i havent heard one christian lyric yet and ive had this cd sense the day t came out.all together the best in your face rock out there christian or not"
4,Great Album,I just bought this the other day. I've never really listened to Pillar before then. I love there style and type of music.
4,New Insights,"""Commentary on Saint Paul's Epistle to the Galatians"" is a collection of lectures on Galatians by St. Thomas Aquinas during his tenure as a professor the University of Paris, as recorded by a student. The book consists of six chapters, each with 5-9 lectures. Each lecture begins with a few lines from the Epistle. He then mentions a few points about the quoted lines, frequently doing this twice in the lecture.The subjects of the Epistle include the questions of the relative importance of faith and works and the question of the role of the Jewish Law in Salvation after the Resurrection of Christ. I found that St. Thomas' explanations opened my mind to some meanings within the Epistle that I had not previously seen. For these insights alone this book is very worthwhile."
4,"From a relative of a main character ,Stan Donaldson","I have not read the book, but have been trying to locate a copy. One of the main characters, Stan Donaldson, was my paternal Uncle. This book is not a work of fiction. For those who have read the book, my Uncle Stan remained in Singapore and Malaysia for the rest of his life. He married, although he had no children. He became a racehorse jockey, and upon retiring, went on to manage a ""racehorse spelling staion,"" a kind of rest home for race horses. Uncle Stan died in Malaysia in the mid-1990's in a car accident; while his driver was negotiating down the mountain the brakes failed. Stan was in perfect health until then...Sir Laurens van der Post and Stan remained in touch through the years up until Stans death, visiting Sir Laurens whenever Stan went back to England. For the record, Stan Donaldson was not a Scot as the book says, but an Englishman."
2,Not at all impressed,"I am not at all impressed with this book seeing as I had to live with this man for 5 years. Ihave heard all of his antics on ""Ruckmanism"" and I honestly thought that he would eventually grow out of his obsession with it all. But seeing as he hasn't, let me share a thing or two with you. Christopher Brendan McHugh,of Freehold,New Jersey: has always been obsessed with religion.The only problem is that he doesn't know when to quit. He will argue the bible with anyone no matter what veiw they hold.You could agree with Christopher and he will still argue that you are 100% wrong.That's his nature.So if you buy this book,take it at face value what he says in it.Because no-matter what side you choose to take, you will still be confused and wrong at the same time."
3,"For you ""Daddy"" lol","For all of you who read this book, Chris, my so-called dad, may preach his heart out about Christianity ,but the fact is he isn't a Christian unless he lives by what he preaches. Even though I don't know him, my mom has told me how he is. ""Dad"", there's no doubt that I'm proud of you for getting your books recognized by others ,but I still resent you for everything.Jessica McHugh (Baby J)p.s. thanks for nothing Chris ~I LOVE RYAN!<3"
2,We Have a Problem with This Documentary,"""Apollo 13 - Houston: We've Had A Problem"" has more flaws than the oxygen tank in the command module. First the music score is not only boring and hokey, it's annoying. I had to turn my bass down because of all the low tones in the music.Second, it relies too much on slow-motion during just about the entire presentation and they have to tack-on corny music to go with it as if it were the second coming and not a NASA mission.Third, there is no narration to speak of. It would have been much better had Jim Lovell had narrated the whole thing instead of the director only relying on mostly black & white footage.The features section has a speech by Jim Lovell.I would recommend this only for the sake of having plenty of original footage. Otherwise save your money and get the two-disc 10-year anniversary edition of the ""Apollo 13"" movie which is loaded with features."
3,Good not Great,"Ka-Me makes a lot of different rice/noodle dishes, some of which are really quite good for prepared meals. This variety, however, is not their best. The noodles are ok, but the Szechuan flavoring is not to my taste. It's a bit generic and a little too salty. I much prefer their Red Curry rice meals which are very, very good.Still worth getting to mix into the lunch rotation, but will never be a favorite of mine."
1,Horrible flavor!!!,"I brought this item to work for lunch today... let's just say I'm eating an apple & some trail mix I had in my desk. The flavor & smell of the sauce was just so unappetizing. The ONLY thing this product has going for it is a little bit of spice. Otherwise, the flavor is terrible. Cheap-o ramen noodles have better flavor. I'm highly disappointed considering what I paid for this (at the grocery store)."
5,wonderful performance by the standards trio,"Would love to have a chance to read the much discussed review of con 52432 but apparently he/she withdrew it.I am gradually getting more familiar with the Jarrett trio recordings I have recently bought and I like this one a whole lot.As other reviewers have commented, these are rather adventurous renditions of jazz standards, with some brilliant solo take-offs by Jarrett.It is a matter of taste, some people prefer the more ascetic renditions of the standards, others prefer the more fanciful renditions in which the song is more like a foundation upon which a lot more music is built on top. I much prefer the latter style. That's what you get in this album, which is why I like it so well."
3,Shut (up for it) to be better,Strong standards-trio chemistry undoubtedly abound is brought back considerably from Jarrett's pervasive lack of vocal restraint.
3,Something's missing,"Don't get me wrong, I like this album. Without a doubt they pulled it together that day despite the various circumstances (read the liner notes for more info), but something is missing. I'd have to say Scrapple, Butch and Butch, and Autumn Leaves are the strongest tracks,but everything else lacks the usual Keith Jarrett Trio inventiveness."
5,Nice musician,"Keith Jarrett is very famous in Japan too.He always says something to himself when playing piano.It is very strange, lol."
4,Fop 'til you drop,"It's hard to encapsulate everything that the 18th century was into a single volume, but as far as fashion goes, this book gives a darn good try. The pages are filled with period paintings and portraiture - excellent primary resources for research, but it would have done better to have photos of actual garments to survive the era (there are plenty in excellent condition in museums and private collections around the world), but that's just me being nit-picky. It's an excellent volume and an important resource for anyone studying the period."
1,Not worth it!,I have several DVD's and books on this subject and this is the worst. Would not recomend for the simple reason that it does not flow.
5,read this,this is the cream of the crop when it comes to vegan cook books.mark has done an great job.the guy that gave this book one star should hit himself in the head with a rock a few times.then maybe he will be thinking more clearly.also if you get the chance go check out the restaurant.the food is first class and the waitresses are hot.
3,nice but cliche',"Ok, I should have known from the other reviews and the smallish size of the book, but this is a collection of one page ""inspirational"" messages. They are great and very nice, but I was expecting more of a self-help book, longer text that truly did give you ""shortcuts"" to happiness. The messages don't particularly give short cuts, in fact seeking happiness is hard work!This would make a nice gift book but it's not the right choice if you're looking for something deeper."
2,I'm glad I got this book from the library for free.,"A decently written series of chilhood rememberances that never really develop into anything. Memiors I liked better include: ""A drinking Life"" by Pete Hamill and ""Slackjaw"" by Jim Knifel?- I would check them out instead."
5,Great 80s Christian Music,"If you like Mr.Mister (closest match soundwise), Jefferson Starship, Toto, or Chicago, this album is right up your alley. Super smooth 80s style production with tight vocals and great musicianship, Liaisons debut album is still an all time favorite for me. I have been enjoying this album since 1989. This album is quite dated sounding at this point, but if you love that polished 80s sound this is a superb example of 80s Christian music production at its best.Strong Christian lyrics leave no doubt about what these guys believe, and the lyrics are mostly well thought out and thought provoking without being cliche. The tunes are catchy and memorable."
2,Fun for any flyer!,"I've played this game all the way through the twenty-five levels. Took awhile to complete. You have to complete one level before you can move on to the rest. There's no cheats on this game till you finish all the levels. Very challenging game. My son at the time ( seven years old) finished the levels and beat the Red Baron on the last level in two weeks.(it took me a month).The graphics are easy and not as elaborate as any of the Microsoft Combat Flight simulator games, but The colors are good, and the plane detail is simple. Still a challenge to fly and to defeat the German enemy. Make sure you run it on the recommended windows operating sytem, I tried it on windows 2000 and it didn't work at all."
2,Won't stand up to decent sparring,"I bought these gloves when I first started sparring. They were inexpensive, attractive and looked to be well made, and Everlast *had* a decent reputation. After only 10 - 12 sessions the vinyl has begun to rip off the striking surface of the glove and exposing the foam padding. If you are going to do any real sparring, go for real leather, it will last a lot longer!"
3,"They work good n all, but...","I like the gloves and they work perfectly fine, easy to put on and good glove overall.The only reason this didn't get a 5 was because one of the gloves already has a hole at the base of the inside where your wrist goes."
2,Everlast Sparring gloves16 OZ,I like the wrist wraps but the front of the right glove ripped after sparring twice. I have had to sew it and will be returning the product in the future.
2,Ehhh nothing special,"SO i bought the ORIGINAL gloves that had the Chin/Jap symbols on them a couple of months ago...BEST GLOVES EVER!but then they got stolen, so i tried buying another pair but every where was sold out or dont sell them any more.Until i found them here on Amazon... i ordered them but i did NOT recieve what i ordered. Its not the same gloves as the picture. Amazon needs to change the picture or not sell them at all because what i got was okay but NOT what i orderedi hate the new style strap on the ones i received. Ill keep it becuase the price and they are better than nothing but i was NOT satisfied. The straps on the picture wrap ALL THE WAY AROUND but the ones i got are little small ones that dont, and they feel loose."
5,great sparring gloves,Gloves arrived very quickly. Well packaged. I use these gloves for sparring for Krav Mega. Good fit. Everlast makes a good product. Would buy from this seller again. Thanks
2,"Good value, but too sweet","I purchased this product because I thought it would be a good quick meal idea. However, the sauce is very sweet and they provide way too much of it. I found it more tolerable if I only used half the sauce packet. Also, this product says it has baby corn in it... each of the sauce packets in the case I bought had a half to 1 and a half pieces of baby corn...This product would probably be much better if you add your own veggies and some chicken or something - but that sort of defeats my purpose of having a quick meal..."
1,One Word... NAAAAAAAAASSSSSSTTTTTEEEEEEE!!!!!!,"Let me preface this review with a qualification - I regularly have the Ka-Me Teriyaki Noodles when I am at work. They are actually pretty good. That said, I couldn't disagree more with the first reviewer.This item is SO BAD, I gave it 1 star ONLY because there is not an option for NEGATIVE STARS. This product qualifies for a NEGATIVE star rating. The smell when I opened the flavor packet reminded me of UNWASHED FEET. That SHOULD have been my first clue to just chuck the whole box in the trash. However, I gave Ka-Me the benefit of the doubt and nuked the food.The only way I can think to describe the TASTE, is to imagine the smell of a chainsmoker's overfull ashtray, a chainsmoker, with POOR housekeeping skills...NOW, translate THAT into a taste... There you have it.I took ONE BITE, spit it back into the container and chucked the whole thing without even swallowing. It took 3 Snickers Bars to get rid of the aftertaste..."
5,An interesting read,"Great book! I've read it multiple times, and this is the cheapest I've found to buy it. It's a great book to learn about different parasites in an interesting way, and was a great required reading for a biology class I took. It's easy to understand for non-scientific people and I've recommended it to many people who also found it enjoyable."
4,Interesting but graphic.,"Interesting for those interested in parasites, some of the strangest of the earth's creatures. Their life cycles and the way they evolved are incredible. However, note that some of the descriptions of the havoc they do to the human body may not be for some casual readers."
5,Zimmer does it again,After reading AT THE WATER'S EDGE I had to give PARASITE REX a try. Mr. Zimmer does a great job presenting a whole new world to the reader. And he does it without talking down to the reader. I loved the photos and the author's concise style. I had no idea most of the life on earth is parasitic in nature. You will totally enjoy this read.
4,Interesting and Entertaining,"Luckily I had already learned about some of these parasites before reading this book because the narrative made a lot more sense than if I hadn't. I could have used more pictures or drawings to help me visualize the parasite life cycles.I really enjoyed the new perspectives given about parasites--how they fit into the ecology of an area, what determines their sexual versus asexual reproduction, how they evolve along with the host, how multiple parasites exist for every species, etc. Fascinating. I would have liked to hear more about bacterial parasites (viruses?). Also, do parasites have parasites?"
3,More expensive on kindle than in print,"Would have liked to have bought this book, but it costs $3 more in eReader version than in paperback. I cannot support predatory pricing from the publishers."
2,"Not a 'Fun' Read, too Sciencey!","I heard the author on the radio and it sounded like a great collection of stories about freaky-weird parasites that have evolved crazy life-cycles using the most dastardly tactics. Which it is, only it is written so dryly it puts me to sleep. This NEEDS to be a GRAPHIC NOVEL !!!! Please hire some artists and editors and redo it, so it's fun!"
5,If this book doesn't make you paranoid .....,"This is an excellent book on the multitude of parasites that have been with us since the beginning of human time. You will never, ever look at the world in the same naive way as you did on the past. Parasites have shaped whole populations and can change the behavior of individuals within a population. I loved this book!!!"
4,A fascinating read.,"I'm very tempted to give this book 5 stars, well at least 4 1/2 anyway. The subject is, of course, fascinating and almost unbelievable. I recall, while in the middle of it, thinking how workable a survival situation these creatures have created, and wondering also if our humanity is somehow directed by some unseen, unknown, unsuspected entity. Well, you really have to read the book to understand what I mean. I can't give it 5 stars because there was some repetition to the point I almost, but didn't, put the book down. I'm glad I didn't."
4,Great book,"I found this book fascinating. He was able to explain these complex creatures in a way that doesn't makes you feel stupid for not knowing in the first place. I gave it 4 stars because I wanted more, hopefully a parasite rex 2"
3,Quick and Fun,"For a summer read at the lake, this is a great book to take along. It's light, well-paced, and entertaining, and you can leave it there to lighten your return luggage. The characters are often amusing even when you are glad these human beings are fictional. Like Drieser's Sister Carrie, the moral departures in this book aren't followed by a horrible downfall, but that isn't the point. Lovers of computer games will especially enjoy the exploration of the minds behind the maddening fun."
4,"A pleasant read, part romance, part adventure","This book isn't Shakespeare, but it was a pleasant read, reminded me a bit of Amy and Isabelle. The author has a gift for writing, she makes you really see the settings. Even though you can guess the ending, you will still enjoy the ride. I liked the way she tells the story from different charachters views. It was refreshing to read about the boys, they were resourceful, and it made me have renewed hope for the younger generation. Don't listen to the people who gave it a bad review, try it for yourself."
1,Not worth the time,"The only believable character in this book is Lucy Crocker, who, luckily, is also the main character. Lucy's husband, whose character is completely wooden, temporarily falls for a ""punk."" Ms. Preston has obviously never met a punk. You can spot a mile away that Lucy's woodland lover is planning to involve her in his PETA-wannabe animal rights stunt. This book is utterly predictable and its stereotyped characters are lame. Don't waste your time on this one."
