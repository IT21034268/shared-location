4,D bags,"Exactly what I needed, I can't find these bags in the stores anywhere. Several per pack so I won't run out too soon."
5,Getting hard to find,"I'm glad I could find these Type D vacuum Cleaner Bags for my 18 year old Dirt Devil Vacuum Cleaner. I haven't tried too many places, but the local Grocery Store and local Walmart don't carry them any more. Maybe they're becoming obsolete. But all I had to do was check out Amazon online and voila....there they were."
5,vacuum cleaner bags,not sure how excited you can be about vacuum cleaner bags - but the order showed up on time and the bags were intact.
1,Terrible,"I received wrong item and I returned it with my money,but I received ridiculous email from seller. They are impolite,"
4,Incredible resource!,"This book is an incredible compendium of facts related to Latinos in the U.S. While sometimes taking a deficit approach (the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), this book is a great resource for anyone interested in either Latinos or how the U.S. is affected by its second largest and fastest growing ethnic group. It's also a wonderful reference for scholars, like a giant Census report that goes into more depth. I definitely recommend it!"
5,outstanding resource for the topic,"This is a well researched book that does a great job of presenting a history of and analysis of the Indian indentured worker population in Trinidad. It explores the origins of the plan to bring Indians over, the background of those brought over and how they were dealt with legally and in reality.Plenty of original sources are cited and used. For this issue I would say this is the best place to start."
5,A great Buy,I bought it as a gift for my wife.............. she really loved it. It looks great and different at the same time and it's got a nice feel and touch to it.
5,Good,The ordering processing is painless. The item arrived earlier than expected. We are satisfied with the purchase.
5,A wonderful gift,"A bought this watch from Amazon. It was awesome. Actually, its looking so beautiful when Compared to the image shown in website.I got this as a gift for my sister's wedding. It is really a valuable gift..."
1,this didn't even vibrate as soon as i took it out of the package,"it's not cool when you buy something that doesn't even work, and you can't return it. horrible. they should be tested before they are shipped."
1,Item did not evn make it out of tha package,"Having had a few of these bullets over the years I was shocked at how poor the quality was with this item. Opened the box inserted batteries item started, stopped and never worked again. Due to the no return policy I am now left with 23 dollars wasted on this item. Buyer beware."
2,Humm,"I liked the thought and the idea of this. But it shorted out pretty fast, and no it's not from me using it too much. The grooves of the toy are hard to clean without using a old toothbrush or something. And at one of the settings was a complete turn off because my boyfriend pointed out that it sounded like the thing was laughing. So i would go from 'hot' to 'bursting out laughing' myself."
1,inexpensive and powerful,The wife loved it... convenient enough to tuck away easily and pull out for casual and discreet use... fun for both uf us to use together... powerful and simple to use... but it lasted only a half dozen of so uses... stopped working... the wiring from base to egg fell apart with only gentle use... too bad it is not more well made... loved the design... but I could tell the construction of the plastic and wiring is not good enough... if you are wanting to experiment with some of these and are willing to toss a couple bucks at it just to see... you will not be dissapointed.... but if you like you gadgets to be quality this will not last as long as some might like...
4,Wife loves it.,Extremely powerful. Only problem is the button gets pushed on accident sometimes and runs the batteries down. Best to take the batteries out when you're going to store it. This thing blows away any other egg we have used.
3,For getting it done fast....,"This product is pretty strong for how little it looks. It's powerful but, unfortunately, if you want privacy...this isn't for you (since it's pretty loud). However, if you want something that'll pleasure you in an instant...this might be for you!"
1,So much fun- Until It died after 2 uses :(,I have purchased two of these and they have both died within a week of use. I love them because they are so powerful but the motors die so quickly. I even sent an email to TOPCO but got no response.
1,grrl toyz silk touch eggvibe vibrator,"Do not waste your money! There is a reason this thing is so cheap. It didn't work at all. Wouldn't even turn on. I didn't send it back because after gas and return shipping I would barely break even. If I could give this a ""zero"" I would but you have to put at least one star. Disappointed."
4,Purr!,"I use this probably too much, and I love it. The multiple settings are fun, and it's not louder than most vibrators. The only downfall is that it really burns batteries quickly [or maybe Im just going or too long?]"
1,Steel Detailing,"I am a Steel Detailer. I draw steel beams, columns, braces and the like for a living. I thought from the title that this was a book about steel detailing. I am sure that I should have read beyond the title because although it is called ""Steel Detailing in Cad Format"", it is not a book about ""Steel Detailing"". It is a book of ""Details"" for ""Steel Designers."" I am sure that the author and publishers did not mean to mislead, but they could have come up with a more fitting title.For my needs the book was a complete waste of money."
4,Seed files to develop steel detail CAD drawings,"The author has organized the most commonly used steel details in CAD formats. I belive many engineers or enthusiast who do not have similar CAD details in their computer will appreciate Mr. Zayat's works, since the CAD files will reduce effort to develop details not form the scratch.A nice collection of seed files are ready to be tansfered into Auto CAD or Microstation.This book is not for steel detailers who want to see more rigorous detailing that normally shown in AISC's publications such as ""Detailing for Steel Construction"" and ""Engineering for Steel Construction"".For students who want to use those details may need other references or somebody to find out the reason and mechanics behind those details."
1,Can someone benefit from this book?,"I was surprised to find out that the book does not offer any explanations of the context, the selection critera, the constraints facing the detailer, for any of the details in the book. In fact the book does not include any explanations or calculations of any kind. Only sketches. I am a structural engineer, and I failed to find a possible way for benefiting from this book, professionaly or academicaly."
2,Stiff and dull,"I enjoyed Van Giesen's Neil Hammel series very much, but Claire leaves me cold. She is sooooo cold herself. And critical. She finds fault with every person she meets. The plot is not bad, but the denouement is an explanation, not something that I felt was revealed by bits of information gathered along the way.I got really tired of the landscape and weather descriptions.Why did Van Giesen set up the bookseller, John, as a potential boyfriend for Clarie and then make him so unappealing?Claire is a stiff. I've read three of these -- can't imagine why -- and won't read anymore."
2,Brake doesn't work,"I've had this tape measure for several months & I use it a few times a month for non-commercial purposes. The read-out is clear & easy to read. I like the way it gives me both feet-inches & also an inches-only measure. The casing is rubberized & comfortable & it seems sturdy enough, although I've never dropped it. But unfortunately, the brake doesn't work. When I press the brake lock button on the front, the tape slowly slips back inside the case, at various lengths. Since this function is important to me (to make repeated identical measures), I have to downgrade this from a 5* to a 2* item. The brake is a major function, & it just doesn't work. I'll go back to Stanley tape measures, which I had for years before without a problem."
2,Book for beginner of game programming,"When I started reading this book, I was thinking why the stuff was familiar to me. Oops, it 's just a beginner guide to the Windows Programming. It talks about GDI, Dialog, Creation of Back Buffer and even the Hello World. Hey, I just want to learn AI. If I want to learn Game programming, I can read Andre LaMothe's Legendary Book. These cost 8x pages while the whole book contains 40x pages (excluding the appendix and index).But the AI part is quite good for newbie like me. Therefore, I give it 2 stars instead of 1."
5,A great resource,"I work for a middle to large size game developer and found myself in a position where I had to learn about neural networks very quickly (we are experimenting with them for part of a sports sim we are developing). A colleague recommended this book and I've found it to be invaluable. I picked up the basics in just a few days, enough so I could follow the code at work, and even to suggest some improvements.I'm was also surprised by how much fun this book makes GAs and NNs. I assumed it was going to be hard work but the author has a knack for making everything seem so easy. Learning about these techniques has also given me a whole new perspective on some AI related issues....In a nutshell, if you want to learn about GAs and NNs then this is a great book which will fill you with excitement and help you approach AI problems in new and interesting ways."
3,Three Stars to Denote Ambiguity,"I could go either way on this staged version of Monteverdi's Fourth Book of Madrigals. I could say, sure, watch it once, just for the concept, especially if you've never quite captured the ""affect"" of late Renaissance poetry and music about love. Or I could say, avoid it at all costs, since the music is oddly truncated - polyphony stripped to one voice! - and the singing scarcely competes with what's available on CD from ensembles like La Venexiana and the Consort of Musicke. And the acting by the singers... either very impressive sincerity from people who really look like you and me, less than mannequin-perfect; or else unleavened dumpiness, cinema so close to verite that it's as false as reality TV.In any case, I doubt that I'll watch it twice. Let that stand as my advice to rent it, not buy it, if you have an urge to see/hear an interesting experiment."
3,Yuppie Baroque,"One of the earlier descriptions gives the plot hook. I might have tolerated this in real time in a live production, on video it feels like an exaggerated mismatch between suburban couples (dining in the big city) and the high artificiality (a positive trait) of the late Italian madrigal. Only pastoral and courtly men can be so pained, musically; the men in the film don't come off as ""sincere"" in a modern sense. There is a sort of slow unfolding of the backstories and the tensions, but I have yet to get to the end ... can take only about ten minutes at a time. This is a lot of pained and weepy madrigals back to back. Monteverdi was not pre-channeling Mahler."
5,"Exsquisitely Readable, Deliciously Poetic","Despite being presented in a prose format, David West's is the most poetic modern English Aeneid around. The words just keep coming, rolling and rich with inventive clarity, senuous allusions, roiling action and stirring speeches, all without the distraction of broken lines, poetic meters and awkward constructions. It has been hard for me to put down, and often hard to refrain from quoting to uninterested persons, particularly in the case of descriptions of Dido's lovesickness. A truly great translation of a great book."
2,Get West's original translation from 1991 instead...,"I've compared multiple versions of the Aeneid and West's is easily a great version, but his subtle revisions made for the new Penguin edition of 2002, do more harm then good in my opinion.He has divided his original long paragraphs now into two or three paragraphs for this edition, has changed the order of his sentences and structure, also adding words into them. All this making it feel more ""modern"" and novel-like.Don't get me wrong it definitely doesn't sound like a translation when you read it, but this version departs from the original epic form David West had created for the original Penguin Edition entitled ""Seven Wonders of the World"" released in 1991.I would try to get West's original translation instead of this release."
1,Translation too casual for an epic poem,"West translates this in prose, like a novel, probably trying to make it more accessible, but it ends up feeling too pedestrian. After reading some other translations, this one seemed the most muddy, the least readable. If you can handle the verse translations, look at Robert Fitzgerald's work. I found that much more enjoyable."
2,Only okay,"I thought this transaltion of the Aeneid was only so-so. I thought the introduction had a very complete and thoughtful way of analyzing Virgil's text. It was very helpful in explaining some of the more in depth parts of the Aeneid. But, the work itself came across as long and confusing. Even though there are only 12 books in all, the Aeneid is very drawn out. This is really the fault of Virgil, however. I also am not a huge fan of long epics such as the Aeneid. If you like this style of writing, though, this is the book for you."

3,Hmmm...Interesting here.,"So after butchering his wife he shoves her into a pumpkin. This was an interesting take on the nursery rhyme and although expected from the 'Twisted' collection, I can't say that I'm all too pleased. The detail is lacking a bit, and actually the best piece is the pumpkin that poor Mrs. Peter is resting in. Peter looks a little too much like letherface without the mask and he just seems too corny of a figure, like he was rushed. Not the best in the collection by far. It's much more durable than some of the others, mostly because of it's simplicity. I'd skip over this one in favor of the more intricate and detailed work."
5,I LOVE IT!,"I think this set is awesome. I am a toy collector & seller as well as a fan of the macabre. (As long as I know it's FAKE! LOL!) This is a really neat little set in 2 seperate pieces. One piece is Peter holding the top on the pumpkin in his left hand and the other is Sally stuffed into the pumpkin's shell! HOW DELIGHTFULLY CREEPY!!!! I think the design and detail in this set is WONDERFUL and I am VERY PROUD to have this set in my own personal collection. I also really like the living dead dolls, gothic dolls in general & all the stuff from ""The Nightmare before Christmas"" & ""Corpse Bride"".--Cool stuff! Anyway! 5 big stars to this most excellent set! It deserves no less! I highly reccomend it."
4,"""Three Cheers and Four Stars **** ""","Excellent!!! This album has it all. Slow and smokey blue with ""Stand by Your Man"" Harsh and tingling vocals in ""Baby Tonight"", ""Run To You"" is typical fantastic Benny, ""Two Worlds Two Hearts"" should be on the top 50 play list at the adult contemporary radio stations. A funky version of ""Sheila C."" is an interesting twist to a timeless rock ballad classic...and the rest is diverse and pleasant. Benny does'nt rock out on this album, but what he does in ""Baby Tonight"" and ""Two Worlds Two Hearts"" might better be considered follow ups to ""Into The Night"", because the passion and melody have arrived once again, this time with an enviable savoir-faire. Bravo!!"
2,This CD was not what I was hoping for.,I was expecting the music that I used to listen to in New York around the middle 80's. I did'nt get what I expected. I didn't really like what he did to Sheila C. If anyone knows where Benny's oldies but goodies can be found I would appreciate the info.
1,atypical overmixed schlock,"what can i say , i saw benny in ithaca, ny at MAX'S when this was released, ive been watching him in concert(63 times) since the first time at longbranch park on onondaga lake (Syracuse,ny) in around 74-75, so grrrreat back then, now a has been,puuuulease release ""NEVER RUN NEVER HIDE"" ""TOO MUCH TO LOSE"" and his best - ""AMERICAN DREAMS"" with the HURRICANES on disc ASAP.....these will change the way you listen to ""THE VOICE""...."
1,A major disappointment,"I was very disappointed in this book. While the history sections are reasonably solid, the author falls into the usual traps whenever he tries to make links between the historical Vlad and the Dracula of Bram Stoker's novel. Numerous times he states speculation as if it were fact. Worse, he makes statements that any reader of the novel ""Dracula"" would know are ludicrous: for example, that at the end of the story, Count Dracula has a stake driven through his heart; or that Dracula is unable to function during the day. To be fair to the author, I plan to write him directly and elaborate on all the flaws I found in the book. Maybe in a second edition (if there is one) they can be corrected. In the meantime, if you are looking for a reliable book on Vlad without all the nonsense about his being the inspiration for Stoker's novel, stick with ""Vlad III Dracula"" by Kurt Treptow.Dr. Elizabeth Millerwww.ucs.mun.ca/~emiller [Dracula's homepage]"
3,Vampirism and the Real Dracula,"Although the book has several chapters about vampirism and Bram Stoker's Dracula, the remaining chapters about Vlad Tepes are very detailed and a good read. Vlad surely was one of the most cruel tyrants ever and his atrocities are described with much detail. Contemporaries wrote about the ""untold abuses, sad murders and mutilations by the cruel tyrant Dracula"" and the author discusses the sources and their reliability by their level of interest in blackening Vlad. According to Trow, many of Vlad Dracula's acts can be interpreted as efforts to enforce his own moral code upon his country and to strengthen and modernise the central government at the expense of the nobility, because they had repeatedly undermined the power of the Wallachia's rulers (and buried alive his elder brother).An interesting section describes the `usual' way of impalement and the most likely way used by Vlad in the case of mass impalements or when a mother was impaled together with her baby."
5,Installed Without a Hitch,"Actually, we did install it with a hitch and it worked wonderfully. Used a 20K 5W hitch in the back of our 2004 3500 Dodge Ram."
2,Shipping box DESTROYED! Missing all parts except 2 rails,"These rails look very strong but I dont have any of the parts to mount them. The nuts, bolts, and the brackets are missing. I would probably give this 5 stars if I had the hardware to install them. I shipped them 2 day, maybe if they were sent ground it might get here in one peace?"
4,"Not rock & roll, but I like it","The House Band's increasing diversity of tunes and ability to mesh the strengths of the instruments is well shown in this third CD by the group. Especially well done are The House on the Hill and Gwendal. Not just a bunch of fiddle tunes with backup, every instrument has a role to play."
2,The Jordanaires: Great Gospel Songs,"Good selections, but this is clearly not one of their better recordings. Unfortunately, time doesn't treat us all well, and that includes our voices. Their sound was always on pitch and pure, but this nice collection shows what the aging process does to even the best of vocal groups. This album probably fills a niche in someone's collection, but it was a disappointment to me, partially because I had relatively high expectations."
4,Exile on Cat Power Street,"""You are free"", seems very much like the rehearsal for ""The greatest"". The latter has an overall fuller sound, although on both, she's refined her voice much more than on her earlier work. She evokes Sinead O'Connor while maintaining her very own signature sound at the same time.""You are free"" also owes a lot to Liz Phair's 1993 debut album in that both share a very ""do it yourself"" sparse feel (check out ""He war"" as a case in point).The arrangements are heartachingly stark and beautiful.Sometimes you can tell when a musician's sound is influenced by heroin. I might be wrong, but I think that sound is here."
5,Beautiful,I heard this CD for the first time today and I'm just amazed...and in love. The sound and feeling to this album is so gorgeous; it wraps around me like music should. Listen...and love it! You will.
3,"Good, but 'Moon Pix' is better","I think this is a good record, but after a classic such as 'Moon Pix' the bar is set kinda high, and the songs on this one don't grab me nearly as much. You'll have to listen to these yourself and make up your own mind, but if you have to pick a Cat Power record, get 'Moon Pix' first."
2,Goes from excellent to [bad] in 53 minutes flat,"How promising this CD begins. ""I Don't Blame You"" is of the highest quality, and alone is a five star piece. The tragedy of her soulful and metaphoric lyrics are beautifully captured in her soft croon. The next track, ""Free,"" is a bit less interesting, but is worth four stars. Cat's repetition sounds like chanting, as though she's trying to perform an excorsism on her audience; trying to free them from the grasp of the stars. The last decent track, as far as I'm concerned is ""Fool"", a strong statement about the American Way.As for the rest, well, it seems like maybe she decided three good songs was plenty, and just started writing about pointless [stuff], that even she doesn't seem to care about."
5,I love CatPower,This was an mp3 so I didn't have to wait on delivery. I just downloaded and started listening immediately. I already knew what I was getting as I have been listening to the album on Spotify. I love Cat Power and wanted to own a copy for myself.I prefer paying less for digital copies as I usually lose/scratch CDs.
5,Cat Power at their best!,I've been a Cat Power fan since the begining this is by far her best work. If you like this album try What Would the Community Think.
2,You are free...to pass on this one,"I was fortunate enough to see Cat Power in Florence, Italy, this year, in an abandoned train station-turned-installation art space. Let me just say that the high point of the concert was the location, followed by the onstage insanity displayed by the lead singer, distantly followed by the music. The music on You are Free is pretty enough, if not particularly innovative or even interesting, but if you take two second to listen to the lyrics (or read the liner notes) the banality is just nauseating."
3,hopeless and prideful,the post modern view from the top of this heap looks like pie in the sky for this unchained caged bird. it is a trip thru the light fantastic. did you ever feel out of control and on the border of civilized at the same time?take me into blue and straight out of the black while i forge new roots into fresh minds.postscript: will the fight for our sanity be the fight of our lives????
2,The single worst Cat Power album,"Listening to ""You Are Free"" again today, 9 years after I purchased it, it occurred to me that this would qualify as a very bad album by Cat Power or by any other artist. I loved bothMoon PixandThe Covers Recordwhen they came out and they both sound fantastic more than a decade later, but ""You Are Free"" is a huge dropoff. The first 2 tracks sound like bad outtakes and ""Names"", which should have been sub-titled ""The Child Abuse Song"", is just trite and awful.Chan Marshall had a great run and maybe she'll get it back. Just don't start with this record, or you won't know why she mattered once."
4,GOOD WOMAN,"I don't usually buy CDs but I had to get this album. It's my first one of Cat Power. Fell in love with ""He War"" (she raps), ""Maybe Not"" and ""I don't blame you"". I really like ""Shaking Paper"" and ""Free"" as well. (basically most of the album) Those are the really excellent songs....there are a few less favorable but having those excellent songs is priceless. Her guitar riffs, piano keys and soft, extended cries go extremely well with D.G.'s drums. It's definately mellow for moody people like me. Her voice is so rich and earthy. She's the perfect friend to listen to and my fave woman-singer."
5,Incredible,This CD is definitely in the running for my favorite album of all time. Every song on it is beautiful and I find new things no matter how many times I hear it. It goes with every mood I have.
3,My thoughts...,"I like this album but I don't think it is the best Cat Power album out there. I definintly think that Free is an awesome song. AS always the lyrics are thoughful and powerful, and her voice is amazing. If you haven't heard Cat Power before I would recommend that you listen to some of the earlier albums like my personal favorite ""What Would the Community Think""."
5,You,"After almost 5 years of not recording a piece, when names like Eddie Vedder and Dave Grohl appear in this EP, how can refuse to recommend it!"
5,Fantastic.,"Clearly one of the best celtic discs that I have heard in many moons, and maybe the best ever! Although largely celtic, it extends beyond that to folk genres generally. Ms. Silva's percussive dancing adds an exoctic and lively twist to the music. And the inclusion of harmonica is most refreshing."
2,Warning: Read before buying!,"As a C++ developer recently tasked to design a ""rules-engine"" for a real-time application, I purchased this book with the hope of discovering an alternative to a ""true"" rule-engine (i.e., one that utilizes rule chaining and a pattern matching algorithm).Although this book does give a step-by-step description of how to implement a ""rules-engine"" using Microsoft Access and Visual Basic for Applications, there is absolutely no discussion of how a rules-engine could be implemented in any other development environment.The relevant material in the book could easily be presented in about 200 pages or less. Rules are not really addressed until chapter 15. Most of the early chapters deal with such topics that are tangential at best. Just one chapter discussing the differences between the type of rule-engine described in the book and an expert system type of rule-engine would have made the book useful."
5,This is Hilarious,I just loved this book - both the story and illustrations are so much fun. My girls and I laughed through it - the funniest part was that it is almost like our house. My husband brings home a different animal every week and they are always getting into everything. I also liked that the woman bought brown rice and lots of healthy food - nice to see in children's books.
3,some things are not better on Kindle,"Buy the hardcover book instead. In order to truly enjoy the illustrations and read the book to your children, you really need to have the book in your hand (the old fashioned way)"
5,Enjoyed it.,"The illustrations are great and the story fun to read to my grandchildren. To Market, To Maraket is worth buying."
5,My 20 month old loves it,"This has become her favorite book. She loves pointing out the animals getting into trouble and the illustrations, which are like a collage, hold her interest very well."
5,best book to start teaching ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE,"Both non English speakers and those with advanced skills use this book to increase their knowledge of American customs. The repetition and rhyme encourage the advancement of language skills. The black and white pictures encourage students to take a trip through an American supermarket, while laughing throughout the lesson."
3,You will either love it or hate it!,"I love this book, and would give it five stars. My husband hates it,and would give it one. He calls it ""That Stupid Book"" because it has a section devoted entirely to vegetables (the woman ends up sparing the animals and makes them all vegi soup) and the pictures are so unusual. The illustrations are a mix of black and white photographs and amazing, colorful illustrations. I love the illustrations, they are captivating. Even the vegetables.The true judge is my daughter. It is on her ""greatest hits"" list. She loves it. So, whenever we read ""That Stupid Book"", Mommy reads it. We leave Goodnight Moon for Daddy."
5,Jiggety Jig,This is a wonderfully illustrated book. Your students/children will literally jiggety-jig because of the intensely humorous pictures. This is also a great book to use in conjunction with word family and rhyming lessons.
3,"No Frills, Cheap Flatware","When they call it medium weight, they really mean light weight. Stamped metal in the shapes of forks, knives, and spoons. It does what it is supposed to and the price is cheap, so I can't complain."
5,"An excellently written, thoroughly researched masterpiece","I thought I had exhausted finding fresh, literary works on the subject of plains Indian/military history, but this book is a gem. It is sprinkled with wonderful, relevant tidbits to events whose humanity is gone in other efforts. I've read about 400 books on the subject, and this is in the top 5"
1,No Soul - No Beauty,"If you prefer your country music formulaic and dull then this series, and most of what comes out of Nashville and is featured on the Country Music Awards is for you. This is the Big Mac and Whopper of Country Music. You can do better, but it'll take a little effort."
2,Needs work!!,"After moving to CA from CO, and having used Colorado 14er guidebooks by Dawson and Roach, I was disappointed by this book. While there are many fine photographs, wonderful climbing history of the peaks, a slew of routes, and many routes superimposed on photographs, there were many elements that I find essential, that were missing. Topographic maps of the areas in question (with routes drawn on them), round trip distance information, elevation gain, and an estimated (conservative) completion time are essential pieces of information when planning a trip, and are not included here. While the difficulties of the various routes are described well, these other descriptors would make the book twice as good as it is now. Dawson's format, at the beginning of each route description, listing the aforementioned deficiencies (with the exception of the maps) is excellent. From the guidebooks I've looked at though, this is the best available."
2,Lacks enough detail on the actual climbing trails,"Very disappointing. Far too much detail on the history of climbs and climbers. Good detail on the approaches to the trailheads. BUT, the actual details on the trails themselves, the most important part, are sadly lacking in information Never a mention of the length of the trails nor the elevation gain. Insufficient landmarks noted and very vague on compass bearing or other vital information such as water availabilty, good camping spots, etc. Good points are the trails noted on the photos of the mountains and the mile-by-mile directions to the trailheads. All the more disappointing that no distances noted for the trails themselves or even how long one might expect to be on one."
4,"A concise, one-volume overview of U.S. military history.","Russell F. Weigley writes that ""anyone seriously interested in U.S. military history should benefit from this small but encyclopedic book. General readers, buffs, reenacters, students and professionals should all be able to make use of it. In every way the authors deserve commendation for making an apparently modest little book into a volume of exceptional usefulness.&quot"
4,Nokout,Our refrigerator had quit working while we were on vacation and the odor was very bad. I tried several things and they helped very little at getting rid of the smell. This product was the most effective. We had to use it two or three times but it virtually eliminated it.
1,Terrible,I was disappointed. The product was wrong for my old SEGA Genesis and it didn't have in the description which SEGA it goes to. I contacted AMAZON and never heard back from them nor the seller. I even mentioned that I was willing to exchange. I got ripped off and now stuck with the wrong AUX hookups.
1,AV RCA Cables,I ordered these AV RCA cables for the Sega Genesis on online. The website advertised that these cables would work with the Sega Genesis.When I recieved the cable I found that the S-Video connection was too small for my Genesis. The cables were not compatible with my Sega Gensis.I was disappointed. I would not recommend these cables for the Sega Genesis.Jerry
1,This is NOT the correct cord!!!!,I have ordered this from a few companies and this is NOT the correct cord. The A/V Adaption is too small the old Sega Genesis is a very unique adaptions. To the best of my knowlege this product is not produced any more. Do not make a the mistake of assuming Amazon know what they are talking about.
1,Not the right thing shipped.,They sent something that looks nothing like the picture and didn't work with a Sega Genesis in anyway.
5,An informative review,"The bad reviews about this product is exactly what they are just bad. This av cable is not for the original genesis with the 16 bit logo. It is for the slim models 2 and 3. It clearly states this in the product description. The reason why they say it doesn't fit is because they bought the wrong cable. The original genesis uses a bigger din connector and has mono sound. Most newer tv's simulate stereo sound with just the white audio cable plugged in. True stereo sound can only be achieved by using an audio y splitter cable plugged into the headphone jack and the tv. Hdtv's will make the video look washed up and the picture will be stretched and cut. Retro systems are meant to be played on crt or tube tv's, where video quality is maximized so keep that in mind. Remember read all product descriptions before ordering, granted amazon is not always accurate and more general, it's still our responsibility as customers to know and do a little research before ordering anything online."
4,Be careful who you order these from...,"Sega's AV cables are of great quality and reliability. These composite AV cables will give you clearer picture and sound quality from your model 2 Sega Genesis than you would get from the basic RF unit.This listing is for the Official Sega brand MONO AV cable for the Sega Genesis Model 2 (or Genesis 3, or Nomad, 32X, etc.). This product will NOT work on a Sega Genesis model 1 without a rare adaptor. If you are looking specifically for this cable on Amazon, be careful who you order it from. You might end up with a third party stereo cable or a Sega Genesis model 1 cable by mistake! I speak from experience..."
3,Good book! Buy it!,"I bought the Mastering Korean book (publ. 1988!) and found the layout and typography serious roadblocks to learning what good information was in there. The type in the Mastering Korean book is simply horrendous!Taehak Hanguko (College Korean) however has a much better layout, and much better type, which actually allows me to stare at the book without my eyes going cross-eyed after a couple minutes, which is a real pleasant change in study conditions!The content is very complete. I am teaching English in South Korea right now, and I want to learn better Korean to help grease the wheels with the students and my Korean friends. This book will get me well on my way to do exactly this. My only complaint: the authors published a CD-ROM for listening and speaking exercises. One problem: they made it for Mac only. Derned liberal Berkeleyites! </wink>"
3,"Tough for self-study, good for classes","I bought this book when I was taking a college course in Korean and used it was the class textbook. In the context of a class it's a great book to go with along with the guidance of a teacher. However, it would be pretty tough to teach yourself Korean with the book alone as it starts off very quickly and gets advanced too soon."
2,As a college student...,"I found this book difficult to understand if you don't already have a basic knowledge of Korean. A lot of the pronunciations that were spelled out phonetically are incorrect if said without some experience in the sound of Korean. I found the grammar explanations incredibly confusing and was incredibly annoyed that the directions for the exercises were not in English after the second lesson and often new vocabulary that was not listed in the beginning of the lesson was randomly thrown into the dialogue. In addition, the lessons taught have nothing to do with what would normally be spoken of during conversation. Unless you normally speak of the classes you're taking, how interesting they are, and how different the weather is during the four seasons in Korea, I'd strongly recommend seeking another book."
3,Fun for a while,"At first the game is really fun, but after a while it gets old. Some of the games if your not sure how to play them in real life are hard to figure out (if you ever do). I was partial to playing black jack and the slot machines. For the price it's an O.K. game. If your a real gambler and understand how most of the games are played this game would be right up your alley. Sometimes you can accidentaly take a turn before your ready if you don't pay attention to the buttons your hitting which can be frustrating. Overall it's an Okay game."
3,Not a good simulation,"I bought this game based on my prior experience with the sega/espn 2k games and the impressive quality of the 2k5 football game.The animation and the features improved from the prior versions of the 2K basketball games but for some the took several steps back in responsiveness and the artificial intelligence. Playing the game was a little frustrating. It's hard to control the player movements and often the player will do things that you don't intend. I think the problem is that they tried to get too cute with the animation. When a player you're tring to control is taking a shot with the oposing defender near by, more often than not he would make fancy moves to get the shot off, often times missing when a simple layup, dunk or a jump shot would have been more approriate.I have the 2k3 version and I would prefer to play that more than the 2k5. Even with the $19.99 price tag, what good is a game when it just doesn't work right."
4,Okay?,"ESPN NBA 2K5 is a great game. But there are some things I don't like about it. When you play, it's like the player is controlling itself even when you are using the controller. The graphics aren't as good as they were on ESPN NBA Basketball. They might wanna fix this game. There is a lot of things wrong with it."
3,"Ugly graphics and another ""copy-idea""","This game is really not what i expected, season is not even close to what they say it is, create a player is pretty much to use it in exhibition match ups, but also the draft is kind of new, not very clear nor understandable, online its ok, kind of slow but still ok, the main reason i rated this game so low is because it doesnt have the speed to make it almost kind of real, but let it up to you guys, basket fans...."
2,Disappointment,"This game is as close to being a simulation of NBA gameplay as I am to being Shaq!The Iso-motion2 feature must be code with the guys at Sega for consistently resulting in being called for charging or having your man run in place while your defender blocks your path!Repetitiveness sums up almost everything else involved in the various 5 on 5 modes. The dunks throughout the game are as entertaining as paint drying, and every player (regardless of size)manages to rock(literally) the basket a la Shaq.As for the game's low price,it'll only mean less trade value toward my copy of Halo 2!"
5,Awesome,Great game with loads of features. i have played both NBA Live and ESPN 2k5 and 2k5 is the better game.
2,All Flash But No Potatoes,"ESPN 2K5's basketball sim is very good. It is good in the graphics and commentary, and offers a fine balance of a real NBA game and what looks like while playing without actually stepping inside your TV, or getting lucky by signing an NBA contract. Don't we all former gym rats wish?But 2K5 just does not cut it for me. Not only has the game locked up in close 4th quarter games, but the gameplay suffers from stiffness, as if the players suddenly turned into politicans running for office. Yes, IsoMotion is better, but does not compare to NBA Live's. However, for $20 you get a somewhat fun and often cool basketball sim. I'm still staying with NBA Live as the game to get this year."
4,funnest b-ball game in a long time,"so much fun, really competitive. by the end of the night, you and your friends will be beating to see you the best. plus, you get a awsome street ball mode. you can pick any NBA player on your team. a must buy for $19.95..."
5,Still the best,"I recently pruchased an xbox 360,but I still don't find it as good as Sega genesis.This system has so many awesome games that first came on the system andall these losers are trying to remake it but nobody even comes close to making a better Sonic. I have every Sonic game out there for the Genesis and in my opinion, Sonic is the #1 game of all-time, bar none"
5,A Great System,I have the Genesis 2 CDX Combo system(both systems connected to each other) and it rules. The Games are great and the fact that people are giving this system up gives those who have them a great chance to find Genesis stuff.
5,sega genesis rock's and I'll get the genesis 2.,sega genesis is good to me and if know else likes it don't play it.
1,"Received the system, but did not get Columns the game.","The system and two other games were shipped to me instead of the actually game in which I ordered! They instead sent me a Power Ranger game! What For? I didn't ask for this kindergarden kid game! Columns was never shipped. I tried to send out some emails on the problem, but have yet to get a reply. Makes you think twice about ordering anything else in the future!"
5,What a great book,"I bought these books for my son and he loves them. If you are looking for books that your child will like, buy these."
1,reads like a cartoon or video game,"My four-year-old enjoys these but I find them numbingly tedious. It's like reading a kids' cartoon or video game. Every page is full of sound effects -- WHOOSH! THUD! SLOSH! -- as if the writer was too lazy to come up with descriptive language for the action. The dialogue is at about the same level -- it's all ""Awesome! Cool! He's history!"" etc. Magical characters fight by shooting sparks out of their fingertips at each other. Aaargh."
2,Harry Potter,"This book has short chapters, and would be easy to read for the early grade levels. The dialogue between the characters is childlike (though to say that is an insult to children) and full of exclamations like, &#65533;Wow&#65533; and &#65533;Oh, my gosh!&#65533; At first I thought the written sound effects, &#65533;Blam,&#65533; &#65533;Swoosh,&#65533; and &#65533;Yikes!&#65533; added to the visualization of the story, but then it just became annoying. I would hope that children would recognize the overly simplistic characters of the &#65533;Secrets of Droon&#65533; series and I believe that they would become bored with the books."
2,Disappointing,"As a reader of books, I stumbled upon Secrets of Droon much the same way that Eric, Judy, and Neal find the secret door. I began reading it, and found that it is full of childlike language, with nothing to stimulate or challenge the mind. It is simply a childish book. Though young kids may delight in the plot, the story framework is disappointing. I'm sorry to those Droon fans, but Secrets of Droon just isn't what it's cracked up to be."
4,Good,"To tell you the truth I was expecting a little bit more. Nevertheless the watch is really nice although kind of small. Overall the relation between how much you pay and how much you get is good. The problem is that you never realize the real size of what you are buying, the should put a scale or something like that."
4,Learning from Harry Potter,"I actually know of a class teaching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in college. Does that make Potter books literature? I can't rightly say, but I will say that the Harry Potter books have dramatically re-introduced literacy into the lives of children AND adults. Furthermore, the series surreptitiously pushes the boundaries of what Americans have considered a long time as being ""children's literature."" Rowling, not constrained by the coddling nature of our own country's hypocritical and overprotective stance towards children, creates a rich world of evolving characters with deep emotions and clever bits of humor. If Rowling's books can get children, en masse, to read and read well, I say her books practically deserve their own branch of study. How many things have caught the interests of children in recent years without stooping to vapid juvenilia? Our children can handle Harry Potter. We just have to show them."
1,Not worth the money!,"I am a homeschooling mother who bought this, to use with the books while reading with my girls. I develop my own cirriculum for school, and I was so excited that someone had made these study guides, so I wouldn't have to. However,this book was extremely disappointing to say the least. It is only 13 pages long with only two pages dedicated to any 5-6 chapters. The 5-10 questions, which were dedicated to the 5-6 chapters were silly, and had no depth to them. There were no other usable parts to the book. There are only 2-3 reproducibles, but they are not worth the cost of the paper to print them. Being an avid Harry Potter lover, as are my girls, this was extremely disappointing. Don't waste your money on it. You would do better to make up your own questions about each chapter and find some free stuff online."
5,Dog Bed Pink Royal Princess Snuggler,My 2lb Malshi puppy absolutely loves this little bed. She can sleep on it or in it when she gets chilly or pull it around like a toy!
5,my chihuahua,my little chihuahua just love this little bed. it is so cute and comfortable. and it washes up like new with no problems. great purchase.
3,interesting patterns-instructions have problems,"I like this book. If you are interested in bead crochet ropes, I would recomment it. I especially like the bangle bracelet patterns. However, the first project for beginners is all one color beads. This is almost impossible for beginners. Mark the beginning of a round with a different colored bead, or use a sequence of colors. YOu could also use the beading sequence from the second project with the larger beads from the first project. Also, the author recommends using crochet cotton for the thread. This stuff frays and tangles. To save your sanity, go to a bead store and buy something specifically recommended for beading. There are no diagrams to go with the instructions. I could have used diagrams."
3,Bead Crochet Jewelry,"Although this book has striking designs, it is not a book for beginners who are trying to learn the technique from a book. There are excellent stringing instructions but the book needs more pictures and diagrams to show the technique. I bought Designer Beadwork by Ann Benson at the same time which has superior instructions. Once I master the technique, I look forward to trying the designs in Beach Crochet Jewelry."
5,Bead Crochet Jewelry,"I paid full price ($28.95)for this book at a bead store and lost it two weeks later, so was greatly relieved to find it for half that on Amazon!! This book is full of very helpful info for the beginner that is clueless about hooks, threads and types of seed beads. It also contains many great patterns to copy or to change to your liking. I felt lost without it, and sooo appreciate having it again."
2,Not for beginners,"Aside from a few tips at the beginning, this book is not helpful to the beginner, (like me) because there are no drawings or pictures of any steps involved.And now that I have managed to teach myself through other sources, I can figure out how to do these things without this book."
4,Sounds from Exile,"Peter Philips was an unusual inspired catholic composer in thesixteenth-century protestant England.Because of his religiousconvictions,he chose to live in exile on Rome,then Belgium.This recording is a fine Philips' beauties showcaise;all motetshere reveals originality,emotionality and striking instances ofcounterpoint.I feel a very inspired performance by Peter Wallsand the Tudor Consort in spite of few inaccurate tuning(""Salve,Salutaris Victima"",for instance)and a formidable CD engineeringby Roy Carr(one of the best ""choral""I ever heard)on Erskine Chapel,New Zealand.I would like to mark five stars(translucentCD sound,a sensitive conductor,repertoire selection).This isan admirable recording;however female voices quivering tuning isan inconvenience;the only fault here."
2,Only if desperate,"Specifically regarding the ""Saturday Matinee"" DVD release by Cascadia featuring Texas Masquerade and Renegade Trail, starring William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy. Unfortunately, Cascadia's DVD is the only DVD available with the two films. Regretably, the source prints are far below those used by Cascadia Labs for other DVDs.Texas Masquerade is adequate as the density and contrast are good. However. the image is soft. So, watch on a small, regular television rather than a big, HD screen. Renegade Trail is from a substandard print which is very soft, missing frames, poor contrast and has audio dropouts plus a hum throughout the soundtrack. This only will appeal to Hoppie addicts, desperate for a fix.Only a fanatic would pay more than two dollars for this DVD. It belongs at the Dollar Store."
5,Great Halloween Display,"Grimsley Manor is the centerpiece of my Halloween decorating. Very detailed, and fun to look at."
3,disgusted,cant get sighted in. taking it archery shop we will see.wont hit target. went all the down with it. and all the way up.not happy at all.yet.
4,A Swan Song,"Interesting exchange. A Swan Song really isn't good-bye, but ""hello."" I like this author's style. She's direct and to-the-point, and wastes little time in sharing her views about love, relationships, and the world in general. She chooses her words carefully in an artful blend of poetry and prose. No wasted words, just simple prose. I hope this is not farewell, but a prelude to another book or collection of poems by Janette Owens. I hope to read more from this writer."
4,Helpful,"This book is helpful to me. I become aware of the fact that all people have addictions (I only thought this before, I have never read anything on addictions that confirmed it until this book.) Though I am not finished reading it yet, I plan to read it again to absorb every bit of help from it. GOD is GREAT and He has gifted different people with different gifts and Gerald May seems gifted in knowing the grace of GOD."
5,Addiction and Grace,This is a spiritual look into the world of addiction. Religious matters do come into play. Good book for research or group discussion in church settings. Good insight into the struggle many suffer from and good for methods of self help.
5,Dr. May's insight will bring a tear to the eye...,"This book is a wonderful exploration into the human spirit and psyche. Careful reading is recommended to enable one to fully appreciate even the most subtle reference or observation by May. Although I've read it through, I still keep it handy all the time just to read a page or two when the urge hits me...which is often!"
1,Horrendous Book.,Horrific. A ridiculous liberal propaganda piece. This book was used in a sociology course I was taking this last semester and did not work at all.
3,Acedemia,This was a required reading for Critical Pedagogy and Literacy class I took at SUNY Oswego(an education class for teachers). I enjoyed reading it and having our book talks about the possible utopia or dystopia of our future. Piercy is imaginative and a great Jewish leader for Woman's Rights. I would recommend it.
5,a classic for a reason....,"really made me look at some of my assumptions about life in a new way. Since I'd read it before, the big reveal at the beginning wasn't as shocking, but, being older, I found new things to be inspired and enriched by...isn't that the true test of whether a book works?"
1,Twaddle,"A friend of mine whose opinion I absolutely trust recommended this book to me. What I found fascinating was not the book, but the way two serious readers can view a book so differently. I guess I just must have missed something, because for me, this book was poorly conceived, poorly written, derivative twaddle. But everyone else seems to feel differently so maybe I'll give it another try. I cannot recommend this book however."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Future society tour.This is just a fairly average science fiction novel, and in a few ways, it could have been done (and was done) in the 19th century, among others. e.g. Spence, etc.A woman gets transported to a future and experiences a female dominated society, and a bad one. Plenty of others you could read before this one."
1,"Good intentions, but missed the point","I read this book recently, and believe it has its demographics picked well. If you are a feminist who sees no value whatsoever in the male gender, as well as no principles or regard for rules, you will like it. If you have any respect or love for god, think families are essential to everyone's well being (apart from the genetically identical type), you will find this book pretty offensive. I applaud piercy's attempt at creativity, but principally she is way off base. She draws exactly the same parallels of men as Adolf Hitler did of Jews in Mein Kampf. I just can't buy into her future world being a better place for anyone."
4,Changed my life forever,"heard the first many chapters read over the Radio and it was about five years later that I got ahold of a copy. I loved the men and it changed forever my feeling on love and loving. Gave me new focus on ""lifes work"" and the needs of criminals. It changed me...all hail pacifica !"
4,Actualy a question,How much weight can this take? It looks really stable but I can't find a maximum weight on any description of this bench.
2,"a bit too frilly to be marketed as a ""1st book""","Ornate pics and frilly text were a bit too much for my two year old. She had no patience for me to read each page to her and she couldn't easily relate to the pictures - which were lovely watercolor types - but a bit too busy for the young eye. Thus - this should be more of a manners book for an older child - not a ""very first"" book."
4,Book of Manners,"purchased for my grandson as a gift, it was smaller than what i expected both other wise helful to his parents."
3,Short & Sweet,"This is a cute book. The pictures are nice, but nothing fab. It's short and sweet. OK for young girls-- up to two years old, but not any older."
2,slow recording bad recording,"This cd had great potential. However, it didn't seem to take off. The pacing is lazy. Not that it should be fast paced, but this recording lacked energy. Music can be as slow as it needs to be, but you've got to have energy. On top of it all, the recording is packed full of a high frequency tape hiss that is more than a little distracting. The sound or one violin and one guitar is so thin that the hiss really stands out."
5,Talon,"Ahh Primal RAGE. I'm only 23 and this oe takes me back. I still remember the arcade game. I'm not sure how big this game ever got but I ranks it in my top 5 genesis games. Right next t UMK3, and clayfighter. Whats better than an oldschool side scroll fighting game? One that allows you to be a dinosaur full of p*$$ and vinegar. Gamers, collectors this is a must have in the collection."
5,Best sauerkraut on my first try,"This crock is not cheap, but if you are serious about making good sauerkraut with no hassles, the Harsch crock can't be beat. The water seal works flawlessly. No skimming required because the scum does not form."
2,???,I notice that there are rough spots on the interior face.i don't know if that will a problem or not.Will inform as soon as I find out.
2,caution...,"I just got this is the mail and for something that is supposed to be incognito, you cant hide it very well. It is excessively loud. good vibes but not strong enough for me."
1,Don't Buy This,"Tried upwards of 10 batteries and the thing never worked. Because it's considered a ""personal massager"" they don't allow you to return or exchange it and I can't find anywhere that will allow me to request a refund. I think I'll stick with other products that don't travel as well and aren't as discreet but definitely provide a lot more bang for the buck."
3,darn it!,"I absolutely love this vibe, especially it's disguise, I've already bought it 2 times from Spencer's and now Amazon, I can only give it 3 stars however because for some reason it seems to just stop working after a few uses! This particular vibe only worked once for me and never turned on again. I just wish it would last longer because the feeling it gives is LOVELY haha."
1,Piece of crap,this thing broke when trying to open it to put the battery in. cheap piece of crap. I want my money back!
3,It's A Little Loud,"I bought this little doohickey after I lost my first vibrator. I wanted something small and discreet.I think its ""disguise"" is what drew me to this one. I wanted something I could easily stash away in my makeup bag or purse so I thought this would be the perfect solution.When turning it on, I became a little disappointed with how loud it was. My first vibrator was much quieter (at times I could even use it while my roommate(s) slept!), but this thing buzzes like a swarm of bees about to attack...I have to say, when I do find the time and have the privacy to use it, it does get the job done."
5,all around GR8 toy,"it's pretty powerful for such a little thing. it looks like a regular thing of lipstick when it has it's cap on and even if you have it open and someone see it they wouldn't think that it's a vibe, it looks like a toy that your kids play with. I been wanting one of these for years just because of how it looks. I needed something that nobody would realize what it is if they happen to see it and it's PINK!!!"
3,Do your research,"This toy gets the job done, but it lacks a lot of qualities. The power is great in the beginning, but the motor will wear out quickly if you need to use it often. If you like to give yourself personal attention twice a day, I recommend you get a higher end product instead. If you're more casual about you-time, then this toy will do. The main thing I recommend you keep in mind before purchasing this product is that it is a novelty, meaning it isn't designed to last for an extended period of time. If that's an issue, I recommend you get a different product.If the discretion factor is something you're concerned about, try the LELO Mia instead. It costs a bit more, but it's worth it due to its rechargeable feature as well as multi-speed action. If you're worried about cost, spend the little extra to get something a little bit higher end. You don't want to spend $20 on a toy that will only last you a few months. Do your research before you decide to buy!Enjoy!"
1,worst thing I've ever spent money on,"Great Idea!! But this particular version is the worst quality I've ever seen I've had it a few months, maybe used it 3 times and it already stopped working."
3,Get your brogue on!,Delightful compendium of Scottish proverbs. I wish I'd noticed that there was a glossary in the back before I got started. A lot of the proverbs made no sense to me as I couldn't decipher some of the words. I plan to browse this again now that I've found the glossary.
4,Do Not Fit GM 3800 engines,"These are all short lengths. The longest needed 6""-7"" more to fit the 3800 engine and fit into the wire guides. The second needed about 5"" more. The third barely fit. Do not know how they sized this, but they should have one for GM engines where the wires would fit properly. You WILL have problems fitting on a 3800. ""One size fits All"" - Nope!"
1,Extremely deceiving.,"They say that they are a universal complete set. They are not. Even though they are very durable and hold up to heat very well, probably the last plugs you may ever need to purchase again. However, you have to crimp them yourself. And if your no electrician as I am not !!!! you will be screwed. The directions are not user friendly. I found a place that makes them in a full complete set so I just ordered from their instead. I tried to send these back but they wanted to charge me shipping, even though they came damaged. If you need any help with these you may reply to this message..........."
5,Sea Fangs,"I love these ""pulp revivals"" and Galaxy Press is doing an awesome job on the audiobook version too. Check out ""pulp rival"" as a Google search and you'll find a great trailer on the series. That is how I located the Golden Age Stories. It is amazing how many genres L. Ron Hubbard wrote. Sea Fangs is one of the Sea Adventures and when I found out from Wikipedia that the author served in the Marine Reserves and later in the U.S. Navy during World War II, I got interested in the Sea Adventures and picked SEA FANGS. This audio is about a hero who is trying to save an ocean yacht from capsizing. In his efforts (and he is under a false name aboard the ship) he runs into the beautiful daughter of his enemy. There are too many plots and twists to go into in this review and best is to find out about them yourself! This story has adventure, suspense and romance and the audio version adds the full drama to it and makes you feel part of the story!"
4,Bad execution of a good idea,"Cordless gaming is an excellent idea - admit it: the tangling cords are driving you insane ever since the day you took up gaming. Now look at what you will have to sacrifice to get to the cordless haven on Genesis: you will have to sacrifice the second controler port - the control node covers it; you will have to sacrifice quality of the control - this pad is nowhere as comfortable as the original; you will have to sacrifice a lot of money to treat the carpal tunnel you will probably develop because the system forces you to PERMANENTLY HOLD THE PAD DIRECTLY TOWARD THE TELEVISION. Lastly, you will still have to sit paifully close to the TV because the system has such a short range."
3,An interesting read but not a brilliant resource.,"I found the book to be a reasonably interesting read, if not a little too cynical at times. The tips and tricks could be useful but I would be reluctant to let the author anywhere near a half decent piece of furniture. His apparent disdain for the use of hand tools devalued the whole book in my eyes, and made me shudder to think what people might do to fine tools if they followed his advice on sharpening and tuning. If you are in the market for useful, cheap pointers and are not overly concerned about potentially messing something up, then its not a bad book."
5,"Don't buy at ebay, do it yourself","Has decorated front and back endpapers. Table of Contents includes: The Gentle Art of Acquisition * 33 Ways to Restore Old Finishes * How to Love Your Furniture * Easy-To-Make Repairs * Removin' Made Less Confusin' * Bleaching - The Blonds I Have Known * How To Stain - If You Insist * Finishes: Clear and Cloudy * Finishes: Opaque and Fancy * Finishes: Deceptive * The Decorator's Guide * Aging Techniques and Fake Antiques * Furniture Periods - Exposed At Last! * All About The Woods * Supplies: Our Own 'Yellow Pages'. Scarce, Out Of Print, Book."
3,"A few tricks, but sadly out of date","The anecdotes are sort of funny, in a lame kind of way. The change in technology since this was first written in the '60s has made any practical value trivial. The 1983 version doesn't seem to have been a significant update. It's mostly an interesting artifact of where woodworking/refinishing was before the explosion of new tools, techniques, and materials changed much. I bought a very cheap used copy, I wouldn't invest much more than that."
5,Ford GT,"This is the companion to my Red and White GT. You need both, and a blue one and a black one and a yellow one and a real one. I have them all over the place."
4,Adventurous approach to a novel pays off,"This book has a dual appeal to people interested in the role of religion (especially Judaism, of course) in leading a good life and those interested in the role of religious history and text in creating an inner life. Ethics and mysticism play equal roles. It's easy to find flaws in the plot, but there's something vibrant at the core of the book that makes it satisfying to me. You certainly can't call the book predictable, and to be fresh it has to take some risky turns."
1,Overblown,From the reviews I was expecting a major new talent. Instead FS & G has published a rather uninteresting short story blown up to a book-length bore. Another coming of age story of sensative young boy. Skip it.
1,Garbage,Poor build quality (cheap materials). Very buggy (connection is completely unreliable with multiple BlueTooth capable phones).
1,"Say ""Cheese""","The costumes are awful and the routines were cheesy. Hemalayaa's ""Bollywood Dance Workout"" was much better."
2,This DVD is for watching not for learning,"Wouldn't recommend to my friends.The workout speed goes VERY quickly, so if you don't pay attention, you're screwed.I found her footwork hard to follow as she is wearing flared workout pants that cover her feet so you do not get an actual look at the feet doing the footwork.The camera work is jerky, often focusing on Honey's face or feet, rather than giving the viewer an overall look at the movement. This seemed unprofessional to me.Honey explains some of the moves in the beginning, but not all of them. She calls out new moves without demonstrating them. Finally, the video is not really a good workout, not really a good instructional video.There is a great deal of foot movements and it was pretty much useless to watch her face when it was the feet that the camera should have been focused on."
3,Good but not bollywood!,"Got this in the hope of having a great bollywood style jump about. First time I tried it i really thought about selling it on! Then I gave it another chance, and sure enough I started to enjoy it. I would strongly suggest an alternative 10/15min exercise routine before it though as her warm ups are not sufficient enough to prevent your legs from cramping or possibly causing an injury! Largely leg work, some good arm and dance moves but overall the music is far from inspiring. A good DVD if combining with say dance your chakras or a few other alternative exercise dvds - it can be a welcome break in working out. On its own though it isn't a strong enough exercise/dance DVD and you'd probably have more fun out of a 'best of' dvd of songs & dances from bollywood films."
2,Disappointing,"The movements are not timed to the music, so it may not good for someone interested in, and new to, Bollywood dance. On the other hand, the movements shown are quite basic. Perhaps this is fine for a workout video. Personally, I found the white athletic shoes and the outfits quite distracting"
4,"$5 Well Spent! Corny, yet cute and fun!","South Asians and Dance Purists, please look elsewhere. this dvd may insult you! Ignorant Westerners, read on.Ok, so its cheesy and looks like a High School Video Class shot it. But guess what, the lack of fancy camera work actually makes it EASIER to focus and learn the moves.Yes the decor & costumes are kitschy (TACKY!) but Ms. Kalaria is so freaking charming. Anyhow, if I can get past that so can you.As for the content, of the 4 Bhangra / Bollywood titles I own, Kalaria's is the one that most closely approaches an actual workout. and I got the dvd for $5 used, what is there to loose?"
2,You've gotta be kidding me...,"I hated this workout. I guess expecting to learn some dance moves while working up a sweat is asking too much. The workout speed goes VERY quickly, so if you don't pay attention, you're screwed. She barely takes any time to really break down the moves, and to make matters worse...she has NO rhythm whatsoever. How are you supposed to learn from someone who isn't listening to the beat of the music? It made things harder for me because its just easier to dance to the beat myself to the best of my ability than to follow someone who doesn't know what they're doing. But if you do that, then you'll get lost in terms of the actual moves she's doing, so either way you lose. If you too have no rhythm, then this is the workout for you."
2,"Save your money, not the bollywood we love","The worst bollywood video I have tried, it was boring and not arobically effective. As I was throwing it out I noticed it was made in Wisconsin, that explained alot."
2,Too much like a regular aerobics class,"I don't like aerobics classes but I like dancing to fun music, so the exercise dvds I have tend to be instructional first with cool music, and workout second (i.e. learning how to punch and kick in self-defense or learning how to hula, or learning how to bellydance), but I do get a workout with them. This dvd, however, is basically just an aerobics class with bellydance moves that she shows you really quick in the beginning. Not the same thing. Don't get me wrong, I like bellydance moves, but aerobics classes tend to make anything fun really repetitious and boring, plus you're so busy trying to keep up that you don't enjoy anything, in my opinion. Plus, I can't stand it when they tell you to ""keep smiling,"" or ""pick up those feet"" or ""keep that back straight."" Ugh. Not my idea of a good time. But, if you like aerobics classes and want to learn a little bellydance, well, it might be your cup of tea."
4,The wife loves it...,My wife was excited about the dance style after seeing The Guru and Bride and Prejudice. She uses the video every day...
2,"Sorry, Honey","Honey Kalaria seems like a sweet person, and she is really encouraging through the workout. Some of her descriptions of the hand movements (""woof-woof,"" for example) made them easier for me to remember. That was good! But other than that, I hated this DVD. I'm pretty sure that Ms. Kalaria and the ladies dancing with her couldn't actually hear the music that we hear through the DVD--I think the music was added later--so the beat of the dancing is not the beat of the music, and I can't handle that. Almost annoying as that is watching those poor backup dancers try not to trip on the thousands of throw pillows strewn about their workout area. They need more room! I really wanted to like this DVD but I couldn't make it happen.Just to leave this on a more pleasant note: I loved to see fuller-figured women in a workout video, dancing and looking awesome. I wish more workout DVDs were like that."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't know how this got such high ratings. I popped it in and couldn't even get through the first workout I was so annoyed. It's one thing if I can't get the dance moves down or follow Honey, but when her own backup dancers are causing distractions because they're so confused by her lack of guidance there's a problem. Plusses are that Honey is very energetic and upbeat, and the set is nice to look at. Minuses is everything else. Honey can't keep the beat if she tried, and there is NO way you can convince me she's a professional choreographer with her complete lack of rhythm.There's a reason why it's so cheap people, save your money and find another workout."
2,Not so great,"I didn't find the moves on this DVD difficult, but I only did the workout a couple of times. The first time I did it, I had mostly positive thoughts about it (probably I was paying more attention to getting the moves down), but the second and third times I realized how annoying Honey Kalaria is and that she often gets off beat (this in itself is frustrating). In the second part of the workout there is a lot of hopping movement, so if you have bad ankles or knees, beware. I let a friend borrow this DVD, and then decided that she could just keep it, as I know I wouldn't do the workout again."
1,Not worth the money,"Half of the time they dance off beat, the music is intolerable and not bollywood at all!! (I suspect she is the one singing, poorly I may add)and I find naming a mudra ""woof-woof"" simply insulting."
2,Disappointing,"As stated by previous posts, Ms. Kalaria is inconsistant in her explanations and springs some moves not introduced into the routines. It IS more like an aerobics class than a fun dance instruction that gets your body up off the couch and moving. I have previous dance experience and am quick to pick up steps but found her footwork hard to follow as she is wearing flared workout pants that cover her feet so you do not get an actual look at the feet doing the footwork. This is a program that is for the more physically fit, because again, as stated previously, there is a LOT of hopping, jumping, and squatting. If you are carrying excess weight (like me)you should probably start out with something with less impact, like the ""Goddess"" Workouts or the ""Bellydance Fitness for Beginners."" I hope Ms. Kalaria tries again. Bhangra is fun and entertaining and I WANT TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT!"
4,Antagonists Review,"It still remains that one of my main complaints with Antagonists is that it's a slim book, and for the type of book this is, it needed soemthing more.Chapter One dealing with Zombies and Risen characters is still well worth while.Chapter Two is somewhat dated now if you have Hunter the Vigil. If you don't have that book, then this chapter is still useful.Chapter Three delves into Cults. Which, Cults also get disscussed in the WTF book Blasphemies. Though this chapter is still worth looking at too.Chapter Four offers up a plethora of Monsters and Threats for an ST to use in their campaigns.And it just leaves me wanting more! This book is good, but it needs something a little more. Such as a Chapter for helping an ST with guide lines on creating other Cryptids and Monsters, much like what the OWOD Bygone Beasteries had going for it.Despite that feeling of needing a litte more oomph, this book is still a worthy addition to any STs WOD library."
2,Monsters manual!,"I read a few reviews about this book and they all said this was not a monsters manual, I disagree. It has a few pages in the beginning of the book talking about antagonists in general and their function of a story. Then the book starts explaining about various antagonist races. A expanded monsters manual, without the nice imaged D&D's has."
2,Right Filter But....,Arrived looking like something recovered from a bankrupt parts house. Filter was in an old style Delco box and looked like it had been on a shelf for years. Box was grimy with greasy handprints all over it and the filter inside had obviously been out of the box at some point as there was a rusty handprint across the metal bottom.
5,Great family game!,"I love playing this game with the family. Classic who-dun-it with the added uniqueness of video-game-style play. Obviously this is a very old game and you need a Sega Genesis console (or alternative that plays Sega Genesis games), so it's not going to be for everyone. But if you do have a console that can play it, and have some friends or family to play with, this is a must-have.Note: my product did not come with the sheets that help you keep track of your clues, but you can find a lot of downloadable versions of the clue-sheets for free online."
3,Confusing!,I dont get what i have to do. When you make a suggestion it dosent give you much if youre wrong or not. It not much like the board game the rules are different. Maybe i need to play around with it more but i find it very confusing. If i were u i would just play the board game.
2,Just play the board game and pass this cart up.,"I thought this game was really boring.I did not get the same feel from this,as when I am playing the ""Clue"" board game.I thought the graphics and music were decent.But thats it.Thats the only reason why the game gets a two,instead of a one.My best advice would be to just skip this and play the real thing."
4,"Educated, smart and well written","Mr. Wurmbrand took the knowledge he knew, the love, the pain, everything he endured throughout his life and speaks from the heart in his writings. He makes sense of it all just by speaking the truth. Good read and would recommend to anyone and everyone, from non believers to God fearing people."
5,Great oldies!!!,"Great songs from the movie (which I also loved)-- plus a bonus gorgeous song finale sung by Robert Downey, Jr. himself. I play this CD all the time."
1,one arrowhead doesn't means it's warfare!,"Like countless book before, LeBlanc see warfare where there is not enough evidence! One arrowhead in a guy does NOT means warfare. It could be an accident, homicide, execution for a crime, ritual, etc... Several people massacred together, yes, that could be warfare, and then again, it's still not enough proof. Violence does NOT mean warfare."
3,This book bites,"Rather than wasting your time with this fiction, I reccomend reading Dog In Blue: a correctional officers ramblings. That book is reality!"
5,"Vivid,graphic,gritty and full of detail!!!","A great story about the career,adventures,and life of a young correction officer (CO) working in the Southeastern Correctional Center-SECC in Bridgewater,Massachusetts.Full of real accounts of fights,murders,drug dealing,and despair behind bars-and the brave Correction Officers risking their lives every day in a tough,thankless profession. If your're planning on being a Correction Officer....READ THIS BOOK FIRST!!"
2,6-5: a different shade of the truth,"Having been quite familiar with all that is associated with the contents and alleged contents of this book, its a shame to state that a majority of the contents are overblown, exaggerated, and totally fabricated...dont get me wrong, some of the events did happen...however, not during the authors career as a correction officer, and not within the institutions that he ever worked in....a trumped up fiction tale....fact....."
2,"Mildly interesting, but rather superficial",The author attempts to show the difficulties of being a correction officer. The story lacks any real depth and alternates between idealism and negativity. I was hoping for more.
3,Mixed Bag,"Once you get past the rudimentary writing skills of the author, the book is (obviously) easy reading. More than anything, the chapters seem to be one big long conscious stream of thought. Sure, some of the stories are riveting -- even lurid. As I scanned the previous reviews, many of them were all over the board. Strange. I suppose if taking a peek into prison life interests you in one way or another, you'll enjoy his work. After I finished, however, I felt like the book was really nothing more than a fifteen minute phone conversation you have with a friend about nothing memorable."
5,This book is great for 3d Animators,"For those of you who are 3d animators this book is great, it really helps to know how to truly make lifelike those horses or other animals that are more complex then bipeds. I recommend this book to all.davesheri@hotmail.com"
2,Content Misunderstoon,This book was returned as I had thought that there would be some drawing instruction involved among the photos.
3,Hope you have a six button controller,"The Genesis version of Mortal Kombat 3 is not that bad.The graphics are pretty good,as is the sound.The only bad thing about this game though,is it's VERY VERY hard to play with a three button controller.If you buy this game,I highly recommend that you buy a six button controller along with it,if you don't already have one,because it's hell to play it with a three button.Overall,this is a fun game.Not the best of the series,but still pretty good."
3,Not the best,"The main things to remember about Mortal Kombat III for Genesis are that:1) It's on Genesis and not SNES, so the controls are terrible. You will have to mash multiple buttons together to get one response, etc. I don't know if a snazzy 6-button controller fixes this issue, but I don't have one of those.2) This is not Ultimate Mortal Kombat III, which is waaayyyy better. You will find yourself wishing that it was mainly because of the much larger character roster.Other than that, it's a pretty decent game that can offer a few minutes of fun here and there, maybe more if you are with friends, but I found that most of my friends can only get down on a game like this for a few minutes because the controls are so horrid."
3,Good but could have been a lot better,"I'm gonna make this review short and simply say check out UMK3, its really like an improved version of this game.This game has good graphics, good music, and decent character selection. You can play as the 2 boss characters with some kinda cheat during the options menu, that's a plus. But the game is just to weak by comparison. It lacks a lot of little things Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 has to offer. The gameplay isn't bad but with some better control options that could have really been improved.Its not a horrible game, but there are better ones like UMK3 and also other games out there that would make more sense of your time!"
1,Score Keeper disappointing,This score keeper seemed like a good idea. Only used it once. The battery went dead after two holes (first time used). Now the battery door is missing and I can't find the correct size battery to replace the dead one. I do not reccommend this product.
1,Golf score keeper,"I received the counter yesterday and was able to get to the golf course this morning to use it. It was working fine up to the third hole when the score reset itself back to zero and hole one. I reset the entire thing and back to hole three. I continued to hole 4, 5 and then it went back to hole one again and the score reset back to zero. One more time I reset the counter to read all the scores properly up to the 6th hole. Finished onto the 9th hole and went to look at the score counter, and found it right back to zero setting once again. I am a very patient man, but this is going back today. Sorry Amazon, but it does not work properly. I did find that if you press the little golf ball just a bit too hard, it is just like holding down the reset button for 3 seconds."
1,Don't buy this,"I ordered two of these. One came with a dead battery. The other one had some corrosion on the battery and contacts that prevented it from turning on. I brushed that off and it seemed to turn on and work OK, unti we got to the golf course and then it randomly decides to reset itself. One of the springs in the clip that attaches it to your golf bag also broke right away. I purchased two new batteries, but still cannot get either unit to work properly. They will count strokes, but I cannot get them to change to the next hole and keep a running total. Don't waste any money on these."
1,Poor design.,"Very poorly designed. Buttons are easily bumped, making it unreliable. Does not retain any sort of per-hole history, so at the end of the game you are left with only the game total."
2,"Keeps score, but too easy to reset","It does what it advertises. however, it is very easy to accidentally bump the thing and reset your score. There is no way to go back and fix mistakes, so this makes it useless unless you treat it very gingerly. In addition, the key chain attachment broke after two uses"
5,A handy item for the golf bag,A very handy item for the novice golfer in order to keep an accurate score.
2,not so great,"We bought this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter after she first started playing golf. It appeared to be a nice gadget, but the plastic hook broke off and she lost it the first round of golf she played with it attached to her bag! Most upsetting."
1,Useless in the full sense of the word.,"This is a fully functional mouse that is compatible with the Genesis system ONLY. As there are only two games that use the mouse, this accessory is virtually useless in the direct sense of the word."
1,Crappiest game since Glover,"This game is terrible.I'm addicted to espn football, and I thought this game would be just as good.I opened up the package for espn basketball, played one game and couldn't wait for it to end.The graphics look like nba live 1998 for playstation 1.I paid 15 bucks for the game at best buy, and I'd rather give the money to charity.DON'T BUY THIS GAME.If you buy this game Bill Walton will come to your house and narrate your life."
3,It's okay,"NBA Live 2005 has way more features than 2k5 but seems like this game has a little bit better graphics. I still enjoy the EA Sports game, NBA Live 2005, way better."
4,Better Then NBA Live!,This game is better then NBA Live in many aspects. The AI is way smarter when driveing to the hoop. The graphics are semi good but are more realistic then Live's which look all cartoony. The franchise mode which is called the Association mode is just plain out awesome. You get to say what the team will do for weekly training and talk to your players to help them out. The 24/7 mode will keep you busy for a while unlocking a whole bunch of stuff with all it's street like concepts. Another highlight to this game is the $20.00 price tag which beats the $50.00 price tag on NBA Live. For $30.00 dollars less you can get a better game. This is all in my opinion though. If you hated ESPN last year then you won't like it this year. If you always been a Live fan then you might wan't to go with that not to be dissapointed. I thought that NBA Live 2004 was better then 2005 though. If you did like ESPN last year you have to get it with all of it's bonus features.
2,Every single time,"this is a review for all sports video games:Honest to God, can anyone make a game that is realistic and the AI doesn't cheat it's frickin ars off?Every computer game I have ever played cheats so bad and is so blatantly obvious about it, it makes it very unrealistic. I'm beginning to wonder what people are thinking when they write theses reviews. If they think EA and ESPN/Sega have captured the realism of real sports in these games, I suggest they sit down and watch a REAL sporting event. These games are filled with glitches and unrealistic plays that benefit the computer teams. Flat out, they make it so the AI can do things the user can't. Throw user skill right out the window in these games because the computer will do whatever the hell it wants to. And this is for all of them...Tiger, MVP Baseball, Madden, NCAA Football, all of them. For $50 (okay, $20 for ESPN games) and for the time and money they put into these games, I would expect better than this.I miss Pong."
1,This is a piece of garbage! (x2),"[...]. I could go on and on about the dumb points of this game but I'll just give you the basics.1. The number 1 reason I hate this game is because you can never hold a lead. If you ever get a lead, no matter how large, the computer will always come back, making these ridiculous shots along the way. Then, when the computer gets the lead back, it goes back to normal and they actually start missing shots again. But never fear because if you work a comeback even in the last seconds of the game, the computer will always almost always beat you.2. Your team almost NEVER gets a rebound. Sometimes the computer will shoot, rebound, shoot, rebound, etc. three times before they finally get it in.3. You have no defense. Even if you anticipate the computer's shot and jump to block it, the shooter will shoot the ball right through your guy's hands. This game disgusts me.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME NO MATTER WHAT!! ITS NOT EVEN WORTH A CENT, MUCH LESS $20."
3,Graphics rock but the (game doesn't)!!!!,"The graphics on this game are outragous. They are picture perfect but the camera makes it very difficult to see the person. Even if you zoom in the most you can, you still barly can see the person.I think the game would be a lot more fun if it had a allstar Weekend like in NBA LIVE 2005.Even though the graphics are great in NBA LIVE 2005, but nothing like 2K5 it is a lot more fun then 2K5, besides isn't that what it is mostly about.I hope this helps you make a descision because I rented both games and it was a hard choice but it was easy fr me to say ""Go with Live not 2K5"" either way you will get a fun game."
1,What a joke!,"I have been playing basketball games since Nintendo's ""Hoops"" game and I must say that this is the biggest slap in the face as an extreme basketball fan. This is the most unrealistic piece of work ever. It sends me into a lather as to how cheap Sega was when making this game. The foul calls are awful, the animation terrible, I dont mind a game that's realistic as far as Detriot Pistons will likely beat the Warriors but when they are shooting 83% and havent commited a foul all game long it's just rediculous. This game isnt challenging it's BULL. Only game on PS2 that has made me throw my control across the room. DONT BUY THIS GAME!"
5,THIS GAME IS OFF THA HOOK,"Man, ESPN NBA 2K5 is an awesome game! And it's only $15! This game has everything you could want in a basketball game. Streetball, tournaments, 21, and 24/7 mode are all classic. The graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is even better. Bill Walton is the analyst and he does a great job. Walton is awesome. Ben Wallace is on the cover, a good sign that this game was going to be something special. This game has NBA Live 2005 beat by a mile. It's so much more of a better deal, too. All the rosters are current as well, so I can beat up on the competition with my Utah Jazz. Boozer, Kirilenko, Arroyo, and Harpring are going to bring a title to Utah. Anyway, this game is non stop fun. I couldn't put the controller down. If you buy this game you will not be dissapointed.Jazz #1"
1,okay until.....,"The AT1000 worked okay until the batteries that came with the unit had to be changed. The ""patented"" battery door wouldn't open on either the transmitter or the receiver. The casings on each of the 9V batteries were loose and hung up on part of the door making it very difficult to open. After getting it open, I installed some standard new Duracell 9V batteries in both the transmitter and the receiver. Neither unit would turn on. But if I opened the battery door and pushed on the bottom of the batteries so that it assured, they would turn on. So I sent off an email to Amprobe inquiry about a possible fix or recall on the battery door. I received a reply that they could repair or calibrate it for $312. Wow. No thanks, I will just wedge a piece of paper in the battery compartment to keep the battery against the contacts. They need to improve on their patented battery door and their customer service."
2,Amprobe AT-1000,"Very disappointed in this device. Tried to find wire routing in the wall but found that it was almost impossible. With the transmitter plugged into a wall outlet using the included plug, I could follow the romex in the wall only a few feet from the transmitter, even at max sensitivity on the receiver. Finding a different return path for the signal, like a water pipe, was not really practical--no pipes were anywhere near the circuit I needed to trace. I did as well with a cheap unit that cost 1/10 the price of the AT-1000. Note also that if there is a light with a dimmer control connected a circuit anywhere near the one you are trying to locate, the noise generated by the dimmer (if lamp is on) swamps everything. One positive note about this unit is that it does come in a nice case."
4,Exactly what I wanted,"This was a gift for my husband. He had this knife, but it got damaged and he wanted the same thing. Using the information from the damaged knife I was able to get the exact same knife. We are both very happy with this purchase."
4,Not bad for recordings made in 1958 and 1962,"This was my first Living Stereo SACD and I bought it because of positive reviews, a decent price, and I really enjoy both Concertos. I was impressed by how great the orchestra sounded. It may not have been the clearest recording but I could clearly hear all the instruments and the balance seemed excellent. I'm happy to have this version but prefer Earl Wild's performance of the Rachmaninoff concerto (Chandos Classics, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Horenstein conducting). That recording was also old and not the best audio but it is my favorite performance to date. I would also recommend Horacio Gutierrez's performance of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 (TelArc, Zinman conducting the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra)."
1,romance novel in scifi clothes,"Altho the characters were interesting and the plot has great potential, it was not realized. It was annoyingly repetitious and has all the elements of the most boring kind of romance novel, where the characters are always in self doubt ad nauseum. It feels like the author and the publisher were trying to stretch this out into bigger bucks...both need to be seriously chastised because this could have been a good fun scifi novel."
1,It's like someone kept rewinding an episode of Melrose Place,"What a tedious book. Who wants to read the same thing repeated 5 times with the only changes being stupid character problems that seem like scenes out of a bad Melrose Place episode. It was totally pathetic.I've read this and the second one so far and in my opinion, they both could've been compressed into only half a book. What a waste. I was hoping at least the second book would be different but I definately won't be reading the third book."
4,Intriguing start to great series!,"I love this book! The plot is really strong and the end is so suspenseful that you should have the second book on hand. Characters are lovable, stereotypical and slightly cardboard with the exception of Tamrissa. (How come they all have to be gorgeous and talented?) If only Sharon hadn't repeated so many practically identical scenes! Oh, a word of advice, don't start reading this series till the fifth book is out (July 99) or prepare to have a couple sleepless nights! Not worth 5 stars but definitely worth a read!"
2,An okay story. . .but not one your going to read again,"While I find little at fault with the overall plot, the repetition of the story from five viewpoints gets to be very boring. Also, what should be the climax of the book doesn't actually happen until the second book. All you get up getting in the first is a history of the characters. It's a good way to spend the time if you are looking for something to do, but not something one would want to read over and over. I bought the first book, but don't plan on buying the others. It does have it's good moments but tends to turn into a soap opera as the book(s) become more and more involved with the personal lives (and sexual relationships) between the five main characters."
3,Convergence had its moments...,"Unfortunately, moments were all it did have. The plot is pretty stereotypical-- five people, each talented in a different element (either spirit, earth, air, fire or water) to be chosen in a group called the Blending.As I mentioned before, Convergence definitely has its moments. Scenes of Tamrissa and Jovie with their little chocolate party and the way the characters helped each other face down their old nemeses were enjoyable. However, combined with dull, DULL repetitions of the same event from five perspectives, some truly appalling sex scenes, the good parts were hopelessly outnumbered.All in all, if you like bodice-ripping scenes better suited for a romance, five hundred repetitions and have low expectations, Convergence should be moderately enjoyable."
1,Whoa! Is this bad!,"I read a lot of fantasy, and this ranks up there with the worst. Imagine having to read the same thing 5 TIMES IN A ROW! Nothing new happens, just the narrator changes. I think I could have stood that yet the characters themselves are very weak. Either they are good or evil, no grey areas. The main characters themselves act similar, the only difference is that they have different phobias. The stupid arguments that you are forced to read through made me throw the book across the room. All in all, spend your money on something else."
2,I will be succinct.:,"5 reasons why I hated this series:1. How much tea can people drink!? Every other page had these characters swilling down tea. If this was reality, they would've been in privys for most of the story.2. Tam and Ro are probably the most annoying couple in fantasy. She loves me, he loves me, she doesn't love me, etc., ad nauseum3. Shared sexual partners always turns me off..4. More tea5.Cloying sentimental and cliche phrasesOtherwise, interesting premise and I did read the whole series just to see what happens next!"
1,Bogus!,"When I first bought this, I was excited to possibly find another fantasy series....but....this was one of the worst books I have ever read! Actually, I can't even say I read it because I never finished it. Not finishing a book is rare for me, and usually when I start reading a book and I'm not fond of the story, I WILL try to read a little more to give it a chance. But ""Convergence"" starts the same story over again, five times--each one told by a different pathetic character. ""Tamrissa"", the ""in-between"" narrator, was so annoying it made me sick. Once the characters began to (sort of) get along, I just put the book down--I couldn't stand it any more. How can fictitious characters be so irritating?"
2,"thin, repetitive plot, poor characterization","I couldn't finish this one, it was so awful, and that's rare for me. As other reviewers have said, the plot is highly repetitive. Each of the main characters goes through near-identical experiences, and as a result, you don't really learn very much about any of the characters, about how they might be different or interesting. If characterization is important to you, don't read this book. A very slow-moving story that I just didn't have patience for."
3,Oddly addictive,"This Blending series is oddly addictive, despite the stilted dialogue and repetitive plot. My friends and I kept buying them to find out what happens next - and then phoning each other up to laugh over some of the writing. (For example, in book 3, one of the characters says that ""My love remains the same, but the boring insect of doubt eats away at the heart of that love..."") Still, we kept buying them. Maybe it's the magic system, which we found interesting.Anyways, if you like light fantasy, you may enjoy this series (but you may feel a little guilty about doing so!)."
3,Good story,"Altogether, I loved this book, and it made me want to continue reading the series. The characters were very well-developed, and the plot was very creative and interesting. The problem is the writing. The author switches between five points of view. This would be fine, except that one of the points of view is in first person, while the rest are in third person. Secondly, they are not arranged in any order: they begin in one order, and end up in a completely different order. Finally, the first person point of view character began some of the chapters, with a little bit in italics. The writing in these was not very good, and definitely detracted from the rest of the book. I finally got used to it, though, and as I said, greatly enjoyed it. When I read the second book, this style no longer bothered me. If you can get past it, it's definitely worth the read."
4,Convergence,"I must say I found it very interesting, its starts out showing you the lives of these five ppL and then elaborates onto there beginning of a hopeful new and improved life. The idea seems so well thought out, the way this kingdom works and as you read mysteries become so clear that you want to reread it and understand it for the second time, almost like watching the movie sixth sense twice and really understanding the small things. I enjoyed it throughoughly, but i must say, that unless you want a series that you just simply finish and forget about, dont read this one. I have almost finished the first series of the blending, and from what ive heard of the blending enthroned im not so sure of what is to be. Its so frustrating that when a problem is solved, be it a group problem, or simply social life, you can tell that it hasnt really been, and something will happen to throw everything out of whack. But I loved the first two, the third is ok, but impending doom is shown..."
2,"One story, five viewpoints","This was an irritating book to read. Beside the fact that all the good people are kind and intelligent and beautiful and filled with humility because of one unlikely quirk, we see the same basic story told from five different perspectives. When the five haven't met yet it's a readable concept, but once they meet in the city, it makes for four incredibly boring chapters out of every five. The author has a good idea for a plot but reading the same thing over and over again bogs it down quite a bit. I will admit that I read the two subsequent books in the hope that this was a single trilogy (because I do like the plot) but after three books you're only halfway through the story and I doubt if I'll go on."
3,mmmm....no,"Forgive me, readers, for I have sinned: I've a judged a book by it's cover. The cover is remarkable, by the way, but I don't recommend the book. The initial idea for the setting and the characters themselves are pretty interesting, but it just drags out and gets really, really boring. No, we DON'T want to hear about the fireball for the umpteenth time. I think the entire series would have been vastly improved if all the material was condensed into one book with five parts, instead of the five book set. The plot is slow, and while Green is wickedly funny and the covers are, well, amazing, the book's not worth it. One star for the setting, which is intriguing, one star for the cover, and one star for a good effort--but not good enough."
4,"Loved it, loved it, loved it . . .","This book was great! I was so intrigued by the whole society and world that the author created. I really cared about the characters. The only reason I didn't give this book five stars was because there were MANY grammatical errors which should have been caught by the editor. And the love scene between Jovvi and Lorand was a bit on the funny side (ie, ""incredible tunnel""). That part was worth a giggle, seeing as it reminded me of the things my grandmother reads:) But all in all, a very good book."
5,Wonderful! Devoured it,"I can't wait to get my hands on the next two. This book is one of the best that I have read in a long time. And considering I read at least ten fantasy/sci-fi novels a month, I consider this one to be an absolute jewel. I was also delighted to find an interview with the author. Green's fluid sense of writing and contrast between her characters carries the reader into the book. Once again, I'm glad that I found this book, it's a good book among so many boring clones. I would recommend this book to all and place it in my fave ten books"
2,Simple and repetitive but a good light read,"Despite the fact that Sharon Green's characters are simplistic and one-dimensional and the plot is simplistic and repetitive you can still enjoy this book.Basically, 5 characters come together from different stereotypical backgrounds and have to pass remarkably similar tasks that are repetitively described in detail. The characters also interact socially and fall in love or become friends. Each character also has a problem from their background that comes back to haunt them later.Despite many flaws the book still manages to be an interesting enough read, provided you skim parts of it, to be worth picking up. However, I wouldn't buy it because it isn't worth reading over again."
4,Puzzle Piece,"Similar to several of the other reviewers, I have read all the works mentioned as well as Ken Eagle Feather and Victor Sanchez. This work is another piece of a very complex puzzle. It is simply not the story of Carlos nor the last piece of the puzzle for those looking (including me) for the A-B-C guide to becoming a Toltec. I am reading Merilyn's second book regarding sexuality now and will then move on to the Thune Mares series. I keep trying to remember that it's the path and how we walk it that matters. This is a good story.... read the intro and two pages at a bookstore. If you like what you read in that time, come back here and buy it. It is a good addition to my collection and I will read it again. Happy trails."
2,ONLY AVAILABLE ON VHS!!!,It is a travesty that this world series video is not available on DVD.Write MLB (they have rights to it) and demand the 1997 WS video on DVD!!Those who have the 2003 Marlins WS video on DVD will understand.
2,Very Disappointed,"This CD was not at all beneficial for relaxation in my opinion. The speaking or guided imagary was spoken at too fast a rate, and suggestions were given too quickly to be absorbed or guided slowly into a relaxed state. I felt more anxious listening to her voice. Felt as if you were struggling to keep up. She just doesn't allow time to fully develop any particular scene or feeling before she moves on. The music portion was nice but nice music doesn't make a guided imagary CD good. Overall, I thought it to be a total waste of money."
1,"4"" vinyl toilet seat cushion","The seat was for my elderly mother. It was so soft, she said it made her body move from one side to another making, it feel like she was riding in a boat. She couldn't use it even after her nursing home put railings on her toilet. Again, it was way too soft and compressed too much, which made the center hole too small. It made her feel like she couldn't balance herself. My mom weighs 110 pounds. The seat was great for ease of installation."
1,item broke after using it for 3 weeks,I wouldn't buy this item . The orange ring at the end of the retriever broke off after using it about 15 times. Too fragile.
5,18' golf ball retriever,good heavy duty tool. I would still have my first one if the cart guy had not run over it.
1,Product is defective,"This was shipped to me and the plastic end that retrieves the ball had a chip along the lip the size of a 1/2-dime. Amazon quickly shipped another and even paid for the return. Within weeks just sitting in the trunk of my car and after 3 uses golfing, I found the plastic end which connects to the rod which is about 1 inch in length and a 1/4 inch round that connects and is inserted into the aluminum rod broke off. I am inclined to believe that the product being shipped to Amazon is defective, as the same plastic end has failed twice."
2,Poor construction,"Unfortunately this item came to me already broken during shipment, but as I looked at it to determine why it had broken I could see that the scoop was not well assembled to the shaft and that it probably wouldn't last a full season without breaking anyway. So I spent a little more money and got a retriever that was better constructed."
1,Dud Retriever,Upon receipt of the golf ball retriever it was necessary to modify theball ring to allow a golf ball to fit far enough into it to allow pick up.That was not too difficult. Each section (5 in this instance) isdesigned to twist lock into place. Most of the lock stops failed withinthe first month. I removed the ring from the Amazon retriever andinstalled it on an 18 Ft retriever purchased for $10.00 at a militarybase. The ball ring and all 5 locking sections of the $10.00 retrieverhave functioned flawlessly.V. E. Carnes
2,How not to package a golf retriever!,"I ordered 4 of these together and all four received in separate boxes and they were all good. After receiving these I have ordered four more separately. They all came poorly packaged and broken. Amazon was good in refunding my money, but I have not received a retreiver. These retreivers are very easy to break because of the way they are designed and made. They are very easily broken if package poorly which these last 4 were. Sorry, but this is what happened and I still don't have a retreiver."
1,Dissatisfied,The retriever arrived in a smashed box that had obviously been returned by another customer with no packing slip or other infomation contained on how to return.It was also not functioning properly.
2,Rookie mistake,"After using it one time and then the head broke off, I asked myself WHY did I buy it. I can't say it was a bad product, because I did pull a ball out of the water, but then I lightly tapped the ground to loosen the mud and POP, the head broke off. Also the longer you extend the retriever, the flimsy it gets. I would have been better off, just replacing the balls and learn to hit them straighter."
3,2 days not enough but a good book anyway,"Although the book is very informative about threads, 2 days is not enough to understand all the concepts of multithreading. There weren't as many application or applet examples as I would have liked to see on the disk. The book does go through a few examples which let me rate this one a 3 star."
5,Pinball at its best,"I gave away my sega genesus to a dear friend who needed something to help ease the pain of losing her husband. Along with my game system went all the games I collected for it. One of my favorite games was Dragon's Revenge, because it takes the players to a whole different way of playing pinball. It kept many teenagers, plus adults, entertained for many, many hours.A few years passed by, then I was introduced to Internet. When I found that I could purchase a Sega Genesus, and its games, I was thrilled! I bought the system and my favorite game, Dragon's Revenge. This happens to be the very best pinball game ever made. I highly reccommend this game for all pinball players."
3,Complete Set Or Not?,"I was looking for complete Ultimate Iron Man sets. So when I searched for them this was one of the only links I received at the time. The other sites were clearly marked, clearly stating that they did not have sets but only issues, this link stated a complete set first but in the fine print that it was only the first issue. In the end I kept the issue, since I needed a going away gift for someone, but expected a full set. I was disappointed because one one hand I read the heading too quickly but on the other hand it seems like it was written to confuse people looking for complete sets into buying one expensive issue."
1,Really?,"Amazon wants to me write a review for a phone I bought 10 years ago? Okay, here's my review: this was most assuredly the worst smart phone I ever owned. The OS would crash half the time when I flipped it open to take a call. Perfect!"
4,LIke it,I needed a low cost PDA/phone for my high school freshman son (who loses things a lot) and this did the trick.
5,Great Joy! Great Scott! Powerfully inspirational!,"I read about this CD in the NY Daily News, and ordered a copy. WOW! The CD is literally thrilling, like being at a live concert! Some big time singers make up this CD, Billy Porter has an amazin solo, Gavin Creel's voice is as beautiful as any, Michael McElroy is a genius! If you buy one Christmas CD, this is the one. Beautiful, powerful, and true to the title, it has brought me great joy. I am getting a few more for gifts, this is truly something to share in this season."
5,A must have in your collection!,"I backed my way into this CD - I heard the choir singing background on a song that's on Brian Stokes Mitchell's CD, and wanted to learn more about them. So I googled the Broadway Inspirational Voices and came up with this CD. I ordered it, and my musical world was transformed. I gave the CD to my choir director, and our choir performed 2 songs from the CD for the holiday services, much to the delight of our congregation. Everyone I have recommended this CD to has fallen in love with it. The arrangements, the singing, and the overall musicianship are at such a high level that you simply MUST HAVE this in your collection. You will NOT be disappointed!!!"
1,don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage.Sounds like a bunch of alley cats baying at the moon with an occasional recognizable snatch of Christmas music thrown in. It was inspirational, all right--it inspired me to put it in the Goodwill box."
2,"NOT live, and it HAD potential","I haven't been able to figure out why this CD has ""Live"" in it's title considering that all of the songs are studio recordings. Most of the songs were originally released on a peculiar government issued vinyl LP titled ""Here's To The Veterans"". I was initially excited to learn that the alternative versions of ""Al Di La"" and ""Camelot"" were on this CD until I heard the quality of the recordings. They sound as though you're playing old 45-lps rather than a digital CD. I like the peppy ""It All Depends On You"", but again, the quality is poor. ""Where Are They Now"" has been a concert standard for Vale lately, but my old 45 lps of the song sounds better. If you already own the singles of these songs, or the ""Veterans"" vinyl LP, I don't recommend this CD."
5,Here and gone,"Wow I gobbled this up fast.... it was surprisingly good.... I don't know why I was surprised but I chomped into a package and boom, gone.Made me come back and order more (although a different brand because my housemate insisted).Anyway, I highly recommend this jerky.... it's cheap for a couple packs and you can see what you think.... it's sweet and not much jaw-work .... just the right consistency/chew/flavor for a fast snack.I really enjoyed this one!"
3,Be all that you can be,"I was expecting more from this book. I am a fan of Maxwell, but this read seem to lack the energy found in his other books.Arrived in good condition."
3,Leontyne Price Arias (HYBRID? SACD),"THE most beautiful voice I've ever heard belongs to Ms. Price. Sure, you have Maria Callas, Beverly Sills (what a wonderful personality to go with the voice), Joan Sutherland, Marilyn Horne, etc., but Ms. Price really does it for me. Now, to review this sacd saddens me. I have a sacd player and, for the first time, I discovered nothing, nada, zilch from my rear speakers. WHERE'S THE SUPER AUDIO? I have other RCA Living Stereo sacd's and all are in fine working order. Such a disappointment."
5,i take this to work,"shes so intense leontyne makes even the most jaded queen wanna cry and the younger guys i work with go "" whats that""this is opera!!! what cd is this fromthat voice and that emotion and that crying for love and your child and your sense of BEING A WOMEN"
4,Good to get a party started,"This is a compilation of two cd's, one for early in the evening the other for late hours. The material contains mixed 70's Disco tracks from the famous nightclub The Loft in New York. Cd 1 sets of with a funk track called ""House Party"" slowly building up the entire party. Cd 1 just keep on bulding up the party atmosphere offering groovy harmonic dance tracks. Cd 2 (late)is not so much 70's Disco tracks as the first cd. It offers more deeper House tracks with a dash of groovy sexy vibes in them hopefully making the female guest at the party to let themselves a bit more loose on the dancefloor and in their conversations with the male guests. I recommend this one because it is nice to have something that almost everyone like in your House collection."
1,didn't do what i needed it to do,I thought this cable would allow me to play my original sega genisis but it did not. Now I am stuck with this stupid cable.
2,"brilliant photo, shame about the product",I *love* this photo - but as for the product itself. It arrived at my home creased right down the middle of the poster. Not impressed about that (that is why the low score - and it is such a hassle to return it) - but for the photo itself I give 5 stars for Victor Jorgensen!
4,Works well!,"I bought this to replace a Belkin that would not interface with my car stereo well. This one from XtreamMac worked better. The video out is a nice touch but I will never use it as I don't have video in my car. The cable going up to the iPod is a nice heavy one. The black finish of the connector also complements the iPod but does scrach easily. I would have liked to have seen the same pause feature in this cable like Belkin had. The Belkin would send the iPod to pause when power was lost. Would recommend this to anyone who has trouble with using the Belkin.UPDATE!!!!!! This adapter no longer works with the current verion of ipod touch (4G, MC547LL) It will not charge or play audio. While it worked great with my older ipods, you should look else where if you have a current model ipod or ifone."
2,Need more songs ...,"There are other Hondell Greatest Hits options out there. Make sure the one you buy has the ""b"" side to Little Honda, which is Hot Rod High, which in my estimation was the best song on the album and a great production."
5,this game is amazing coun't of ever bought a wrestling game,UUU will not regret buying this game. I love the graphics undertaker's so cool. If u have gamecube buy yhis game rite now.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Even though the story mode is a bit crappy it is good.
3,day of reckoning,dont get this game i made a big mistake getting this game smackdown vs raw comes out in november get that dont get this game its not very good.
4,One of the Best Wrestling Games To Date,"I am not really a wrestling fan, but I definitely played many wrestling games in my day. This game is a lot of fun! I think the character creation is a ton of fun. The graphics are by far the best and very realistic.The one complaint I have about this game is that there are about 3-4 songs in this game, (with singing) that play over and over in the story mode, menu, and during matches. This can get EXTREMELY repetitive. It actually started to drive me nuts. All in all this is a great game, even for the non hardcore wrestling fan."
1,Piece of Monkey Crap,"(...)This is the most frustrating wrestling game I've played since WCW Thunder. The controls in DoR are absolutely rediculous. Tedious, worthless game. I mean, how can Christian beat Andre the Giant? I've already prepared to throw this game away, because it's so worthless, it wouldn't be worth trading in. DON'T BUY THIS (...)!"
2,"one step forward, two steps back","This game has a much better story mode than previous gamecube wrestlemanias and more create a wrestler options and more play mode options.I wish there where more wrestlers and costumes to choose from however.However the control is what kills it, while last years version had bad control this one has horrible control. Actually the control itself isn't that bad it's tag team control that's bad. Which is where you always get held up in the Story Mode, the stupid tag matches. If they'd have just making the tag matches optional I would have played the whole story mode, but they didn't. The Wrestlemania Series keeps going one step forward and two steps back, maybe one year they'll finally get story and control down in the same year! It happened back for the N64 right?"
4,BEST GAME EVER!!!! Day of reckoning!!!,well i havent got this game yet but it looks Sweet! it has the best graphics and for story mode the only bad thing is you have to create a person but still its better than Wrestle mania 19 cuz 19 was just plain stupid it had good graphics has alot of people but throwing countless security guards builders or workers off a platform real wrestlers dont throw guys of a construction site. im planning on getting this game for christmas but for anyone that says this game is not worth buying is crazy dont listen to the review its about what u think this game is 2 thumbs up and gonna be kickin ass with kane john cena and rey myserio and Evolution
2,One problem....,I have seen as well as played day of reckoning. It is a very fun game to play. The graphics are wonderful and at times seem very real. The created characters can be made to look very realistic. Game play is very fluent.The only problem I have with this game at this point is that You can't use a female created player to play in story mode but you can with a male. So.. if you are a female and would like to play in story mode just to make it clear you have to compromise with a male superstar or playing in exhibition matches.
4,day of reckoning,this game is awsome but what i dont get is the story mode why do you need to create a wrestler. I was looking forwood to being John Cena.but I dont care becouse they pick your matches but exbadition you pick the matches and if it is going to be discualification or not so it is like where the manager.get this game its good but dont bother doing story mode it stinks
3,WWE Day of Reckoning,"This game is ok but is not one of the better games the WWE has put out in the past. The graphics are great and the bra and panty matches are great. But don't care for the rest of the game. You can't create matches to win championships like in the others. It is pretty neat where you create your wrestler and start at the beginning and work your way up the ranks in the story mode, but that seams to be the only way you can win or go to title matches. Don't think that it is worth the cost, but will play it anyway. Also, can't create a female and let her go thru the ranks in story mode. Plus you don't have as many characters to chose from in other matches."
2,wwe dor,"this game makes me feel like muhammad hassan because he never lost any match. i mean the smackdown series in ps2 is better because you don't have to every match in season mode. the season mode sucks. cause you can't be a normal superstar.you can't even do a bra & pantie match with a cas diva. this game has a lack of roster. no jbl,hurricane,only 4 divas (none from smackdown),no dudleys none of the active roster before this game was out. even the entrance videos don't have the whole video. a lot of the superstars have a terrible attire like an old one they were wearing. so don't by this game. save your money for day of reckoning 2"
2,Too simple,"It isn't crap but it's just to simple and short.For some reason, Gamecube always gets WWE games which are much worse than PS2 WWE games.Even Nintendo 64 was more succesful at getting better wrestling games.There is no elimination chamber.Matches are far to easy and simple.The game is just to short."
2,Day of Reckoning fits its title when you play it,DOR is a very repetetive game in just about any way you look at it. The season mode is just doing pointless missions that are so easy its not funny or so annoying its terrible. I would only suggest this game to a wrestling fan that just don't have much to do.
4,it's awesome man!,"i mean it's like the coolest game ever! i love the control settings.. especially the tag team controls!! i like to create characters! it's so cool! and i can play like spiderman, which can be created!! awesome!! it's like: X nice, Axl awesome! i mean it's the bomb! and you can hurt the referee like in other games! it's full of cool things! BUY IT!! BUUUY IT!"
4,Okay!,"This is a great...well more of an OK game, it would be 5 but wrestlmania 8x & XIX had like 20 wrestlers this dosen't have my favorites The Dudley Boys, not even Spike, but all of the fan favorites besides Bubba or D-von (and the Hurricane) are here but there are only 5 legedns and 4 to unlock (start with Roddy Piper unlock Andre the giant, Brutus ""the Barber"" Beefcake,Greg ""the Hammer "" Valentine,and Bret Hart)(not in that order) You also only get Raw and Smackdown, there are plenty of moves and ones to unlock."
5,Perfect for key fobs and essentials,"I own a Jeep Wrangler, so when I go to the beach I don't like to leave anything valuable behind (I rarely use the top). My new Jeep key is combined with the keyfob, however, so I can no longer just tuck in into my wetsuit's internal pocket when I go surfing.With the Aquapac, I can throw my key, ID, credit card, and a bit of cash inside, fix the excellent lanyard around my neck and tuck the pouch into my wetsuit. It works like a charm.The thing is totally watertight BUT moisture can condense inside the bag (I'm in cold water and the bag is against my warm chest). Still, it's never collected so much moisture that it's been a problem. After removing my items, I always stuff some paper into the bag so it will remain open (and dry out)."
1,it didn t work for me..,"this phone is the worst i ve bought until now, cause it is full of problem to use, when i was at my bedroom the signal was gone and i always must to be near of base..."
2,A Step Back Into the 70's,"Not expecting much after picking it up at a yard sale (the first page intrigued me), I was pleasantly surprised with ""The Vanished."" It was like stepping back into 1973 along with the nameless private detective Bill Pronzini has featured in many similar novels. The story unfolds in much the same way I would imagine the average missing person investigation might -- slowly and methodically. There are many frustrating dead ends for our plodding hero, with a strange, almost innocent romance thrown into the works. Pronzini dutifully takes us to the end before divulging the secret behind the missing man, and I found the narrative mildly entertaining just for the feel of northern California and the American military world in Germany in the early 1970s."
1,Not suitable,"Well, I bought this action figure for my son, but also so that he could play superheros wth his older sister. I was disappointed that catwoman was very curvy, in fact a little obscene for a child. It only went downhill from there. Within 2 minutes of playtime- out of the package, her leg was broken."
5,Great CD!,This is an excellent cd with many truly enjoyable songs. Andy M. is at his best singing traditional songs from Ireland and Scotland. I had the pleasure of seeing/hearing Andy Stewart in concert a few years ago. It was one of the best concerts I have ever attended. The guy is a great singer with the right emotional involvement to make the songs moving and meaningful. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who has an appreciation for traditional and folk music.
4,a good read,"I think the book is wonderful. Having written that, what the other readers said of its failings are true, and it should not be taken literally when planning a trip. To show an example, a friend of mine did not realize that there is now a paved road to Calakmul and did not go there.The book also failed to mention that there was a hotel at the time of publication, the Mirador Maya. Now there is another, the Calakmul. Both are basic, but the area is not the wasteland one would expect from guide books."
3,Needs updating; somewhat incomplete.,"Having spent the better part of a month touring archeological sites in the Yucatan this summer (1998) attempting to use this book as a guide, it became apparent that the book covers very little of the southeast Yucatan penninsula (which should include Belize, but doesn't) and the recently opened ruins at Dzibanche and Kinichna (1996). These are some important areas well worth a look, but are not covered. Also Mayapan differed significantly from the description in the book owing to some fairly recent work there. The descriptions are rather dry and would benefit from more historical and anthropological information."
4,collector's encylopedia of weller pottery,I found this book to be very helpful in the history and identification of patterns. This is a really good resource book. I would love to see updated values.
4,Weller Pottery,"The book gave information about Weller pottery, like any book it can not cover all the pieces of pottery or antique. It did have some information on Sicard and other items people may not be familiar with. It did have information on marks and some artist which is always good. Maybe not enough on some of the unmarked Weller, but overall it was helpful."
4,Very pleased.,I was very pleased with the Motorola V190 phone. It was shipped promptly and was exactly as described. Price was very good and we were just able to insert our sims card and it was ready to go.
2,They sent the wrong item!!!!,"The phone was sent on time, but they sent me the wrong phone and their sales are final IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE WARRANTY. So i pretty much just waisted my time and money. I haven't had any luck with getting in contact with them YET. Don;t buy it."
4,Cell phone,The item was brand new. It was good except it doesn't look like what the picture shows. a little bit different other than that it's good.
1,Not Unlocked,"The phone was not unlocked as advertised, and the IMEI unlock code could not be found, making it impossible to use the unit. Returned after a week of frustration -- unclear how the vendor intends to profit by paying to ship phones around the country."
1,Mototola V190 Unlocked Cell Phone-U.S. Version,"This phone was advertised as ""Unlocked"". When they arrived, I put my sim chip in and when I powered the phone to use it I was asked for a ""code"" to use the phone. After talking to customer service I was told this phone was not ""Unlocked"" and I had to return them."
2,"unlocked, but blocked","Got the phone. It was indeed unlocked.But it was programmed as Cingular, which was not stated in the sales add.Can not use any of my cell service features because it is Cingular.But it works for the basic stuff, so I can not complain.For some odd reason, it has a low sensitivity (shows low signal compared with TMobile phone at same location). But otherwise I like the phone.Please include type of programming in sales add, so people can decide."
2,NOT US VERSION-CANADIAN,"I have owned the Motorola V190 before and they are a good little phone. However, this phone was listed as US Version when in fact it was Canadian. No one at Amazon, AT&T or Motorola in US or Canada could help me. Therefore I am sending the phone back. Also it was suppose to be black and it was all silver."
3,Piece of plastic for making calls,"The phone call was not the same as the one that was shown in the picture. It was a different color and a different model. It was also made of cheap plastic, and it got scratched on the face within a matter of days."
4,Nice basic cellphoneThis is a,"This is a nice, basic clamshell style cellphone.This phone fits the bill as a replacement for a lost phone.It has all the basic features speed dial, speaker feature ,auto redial etc.The keypad is easy to use.The battery standby time is excellent.It lacks a camera otherwise this has been a good phone so far."
3,phone,"it worked right out of the box after I put in my SIMM card. However,the phone lasted less than a year."
3,Good phone for the price,"I bought this for a monthlong trip to Europe, and it did everything I needed it to. I bought a SIM card separately (the ""free"" SIM card you can get with it is a ripoff to use). Basic texting and calling were very easy and straightforward."
5,Exquisite,"First of all, Kudos to those guys who started PS Classics because every time one of their CD's comes out, it is time to rejoice, as far as I am concerned. This one though, just tops the charts! What an exquisite score! Romantic! Lush! Complex, both emotionally and psychologically, yet completely accessible...melody after melody capturing you...grabbing you by the throat! I don't know when I have heard such deep committment...from every singer to every player. I am floored, I only wish I saw it, because the production photos look so beautiful! WHO IS KELLI O'HARA??? She is MAJOR! Bravo to Ricky Ian Gordon and Richard Nelson!"
1,Deserved Death for LIFE WITH ALBERTINE,"Upon a third listening to the recently released cast recording of the deservedly short-lived Playwrights' Horizon musical MY LIFE WITH ALBERTINE, I have yet to discover one iota of worth to this mindless score and convoluted ""reminisence"" musical. The excellent Emily Skinner, Brent Carver, and other are in posession of their usual fine voices, but are totally wasted in this garble of pseudo-French ribaldry and cloying sentiment. The plot itself, in which Mr. Carver recalls his affairs with the fickle Albertine, is muddled and contrived and poorly presented. But the score (or lack thereof) is the main culprit: not a touch of melody or charm to be found, as if it had been composed by a William Finn or a Stephen Sondheim while heavily sedated. Lyrically it fares no better: when songs attempt to be cute and naughty, they offend. When they attempt emotion, they rankle. All in all, one of the most un-listenable and disappointing cast recordings in many years."
1,False Advertising - Not Actual Dirt Devil Bags,"We ordered these bags because they were advertised as actual Dirt Devil products, including the image. What we received was a bag of generic ""designed to fit Dirt Devil"" bags. Not sure if they work, but this is blatant false advertising."
1,Bags returned. No refund received.,The vacuum that these bags were purchased for did not ship so they were returned unopened. No refund has been received.
1,The bags have torn in use.,"I got a new Dust Devil vacuum in July and bought a 10 pack of these basic bags with it. I have 2 dogs, neither with long hair or a heavy coat. I change the bags out every 2 weeks, and so far 3 of the bags have burst open while in use. While vacuuming dust started blowing out of the bag holder on the vacuum, and when I turned it off and opened it up there was a hole in body of the bag.Even when the bag hasn't burst, there is always a large amount of fine dust in the bag holder on the vacuum. I currently change out the bags once a week (not very cost effective), and will order heavier bags next time, but will definitely not purchase these bags again."
3,"This Bag Versus ""Microfresh"" Bags","When I first got my Dirt Devil Vacuum I ordered these bags by mistake instead of the ""Microfresh"" Dirt Devil Bags. These bags are cheaper than the ""Microfresh"" bags but they are more porous and do not contain small particles as well. For most people its probably worth the extra money to buy the ""Microfresh"" bags.These bags would be good to use if you just got new carpet and want some cheap bags to pick up all the shedding of fibers."
3,Dusty,"The bags seems unable to contain the dust properly. I'm not sure why that is, but when I open the body of the vaccuum, I smell and see dust all over it."
1,Worst bags ever!!,These are the worst bags I have ever bought in the last 23 years of janitorial work. They break almost immediately. I am very unhappy with them.
4,"Received MADE FOR Dirt Devil bags, NOT Dirt Devil brand bags as pictured","The bags I received were not like the photo representing the product here. Actually, what I received were an off-brand bag made to work on vacuums that take a Dirt Devil Type U bag. Though, that's not a problem for me. They work just as good.Just be aware that a few reviewers that have ordered here have received the off-brand, NOT the Dirt Devil brand.There's not that much I can think to say about reviewing vacuum bags...all I will say is these have worked very well so far. I've used these for replacement bags for my Dirt Devil vaccuum and no tears or leaks! That means no more mess for me to clean up when I change the bags (and that's a great thing!)."
5,Genuine Dirt Devil bags at a nice price,"These bags are the real deal, made by Dirt Devil (Royal) and manufactured in China. Nothing beats a heavy 12 amp motor and vacuum cleaner bags. Forget about expensive Hoovers, Dysons, Bissells. Dirt Devil knows how to make cleaning easy and efficient."
5,Dirt Cheap - and perfect,"Dirt Cheap - and perfect. I'd resorted to trying to ""empty"" old bags when I couldn't find any in local stores. Then I thought, hey, I use Amazon for gadgets and stuff. Why not vacuum bags. And presto... Should have thought of Amazon sooner."
4,Low Cost Bag - Does the Trick,"For the price + quantity, this is a good buy. The bags are not as high quality as the one that ships initially with the Vacuum. Still, was happy with the fit - works for me and since I have a good quantity, I can be more free to switch the bags out more regularly."
4,Good bags,These work just fine. I also bought a new vac and I like it too. I don't like the idea of needing to put in more words than I wish. I will no longer write reviews.
2,loose fit,"i have a eureka sweeper that takes type u bags, however, these dirt devil type you bags do not fit snug around the connection to my my sweeper. shouldn't all type u fit the same? i never had this problem before when buying non-eureka type u bags. suggest you only buy these if you have a dirt devile sweeper. service from the retailer was great."
3,"great idea, function needed help","This is a good product to compliment my air lift suspension air bags, unfortunately I had a very difficult time getting the push-on connectors to stop leaking. Because I work as a industrial automated machine tech and had access to SMC brand push-on connectors I was able to replace the Parker connectors that came with the kit and yeah, no more leaks! Always make sure you use a pneumatic line cutting tool and make the cut squarely across the tubing. If that doesn't work, get some SMC 1/4"" connectors and give them a try. I didn't have the correct fittings to replace the Parker female x 1/8 treaded fitting attached to the low pressure solenoids,so I removed the solenoids and wiring that automatically fill the air bags when they sense 5 or less lbs of air in them. I have had 60 psi in the system for the last 2 weeks and have not seen any noticable change in pressure."
3,one of two Air Gauges in panel was disabled,"Bought the kit as a gift to my son for his Mitsubishi Montero. One of two Air Gauges in panel display smaller pressure than in reality. I'm in Russia and don't want to begin endless conversation about the warranty, the rather that Amazon does not send to Russia. Easier to buy 2 new air gauges in ebay."
4,Earth vs. Hathor,"Stargate Retribution by Bill McCay brings back the action in the series. I loved the first book yet found the second book wanting. But the third book brought back both the action, the swiftly moving plot and the characters with all their flaws and conflicts. Earth must now prepare for the attack by Hathor and the Boat of a Million Years. Can Jack O'Neil and General West explain to the military just WHAT is about to hit the planet? Can Daniel Jackson find homes and jobs for the homless people of Adydos? Can Earth find anything in the past to fight for their future?"
4,Wonderful music but not the best selection of tunes.,"As far as I am concerned, the Tannahill Weavers can do no wrong. My only problem with this album is that it's rather monotonous, compared to many of their other albums. Their performances are superb, as always."
4,Leaving St. Kilda,"The Tannahill Weavers have long been a favorite of mine, and while this isn't my favorite of their cds, it does show their wonderful range of emotional playing styles. The opening set is a rollicking good time with pipes blasting, I recommend a good high volume on your speakers for that one... You'll enjoy this cd!"
1,Not what I expected in a book for Single Parents.,"I was not pleased with this selection at all. Of the five books I purchased through Amazon.com involving the single parent, this was the only one I could not force myself to read. Instead of giving you insight and advise on single parenting, the author used Bible verses that implied single parents were inferior to two parent families. Too much negativity for me!!!"
5,I am hooked on Gordon Crews,"This book was so informative. I was studying school violence but after reading this book I immediately purchased ""Chasing Shadows."" Dr. Crews is so insightful with his writings that I became enthralled with juvenile violence. I look forward to reading more books by Gordon Crews."
1,There are far better books than this one on the market.,"Barnes reduces the complexities of developing a career as a fine artist to short, opinionated paragraphs under multiple headings. It sounds condescending and dictorial. Some of the bad advice she gives includes suggesting you move to New York; courting gallery owners like her with flowers, limos, lunch, or buying art from her shows. If you are looking for a quick overview of the artist-gallery relationship from this particular dealer's perspective, you'll find that information here, but I suggest you try a worthy publication like Cay Lang's Taking The Leap or Carol Michels' How to Survive and Prosper as an Artist."
5,"Good buy, good quality","I had a friend put this together for me and I was thrilled when he was finished. It's a solid cart with such a nice look. I have a big, heavy microwave oven and this cart doesn't feel like it's too flimsy to support the weight. I also love the cabinet space and drawer where I keep microwave oven related things.(directions for cooking in the oven and microwve recipe books in the drawer and in the cabinet, covers for dishes used in cooking in the oven.) I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good, firm piece of furniture for your kitchen."
5,Was everything it said in AD.,This cart is very sturdy and solid wood. My daughter put it together in about 1 1/2 hours. I'm very pleased with it.
4,Nice quality,"I ordered this product for my kitchen after much shopping around. I wanted something all wood, not the white/wood look that is really common for microwave carts. This took my husband about 1.5 hours to put together. The directions were not marked as well as they could be in some parts but we managed to get it together. I really agree that it will take two people. It looks awesome finished! I put my microwave on top, store potholders in the drawer and put kitchen odds and ends in the bottom. It really looks nice assembled and is a good, sturdy cart! :)"
3,I know why it was one clearance,"My shipment was delivered sooner than I expected. There were a few cosmetic issues; something that looked like water damage, the hinges do not have much room to adjust to align the doors properly,and the sides and back are thin like cardboard. I expected something a little better after seeing the MSRP. The product was full functional and meets my needs."
5,Excellent mouse,"I bought this for my 10.1"" MSI Netbook. It works great. I have a wireless mouse for my 14"" laptop and it's constantly loosing signal. I'm glad I went with this corded mouse. Make sure you download the Kensington Mouse software. You will need it in order to make the wheel button work. I set mine up as the ""Browser Back Button"""
2,Nice but fragile,The cord is extremely lightweight and extremely fragile - worked for one day and one cord roll-up.
2,Worked for 15 minutes,"I was so happy when I got this mouse! The retractable cord was great and the feel of it seemed to be fairly high quality. Unfortunately, it worked for 15 minutes, literally, and then I got an error message. ""One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it"" I tried using the mouse on each usb port on my laptop to no avail. Very annoying. Based on the reviews it looks like I'm the only one with this problem."
5,Great portable mouse,"I love this mouse and its worked well for me for a couple of years now. Its priced better than than some competitors. It retracts easily and is very comfortable in my hand. I have very small hands, so I can't say everyone would agree, but it works for me."
5,I recommend this mouse,"I recommend this mouse very much. It is medium sized and comfortable to use. I like the rubber grips it has on the sides and top. I also like that it gives a soft ""click"" sound when you do a right or left click. Some mice are kind of loud, but this one is not. The same goes for the scroller. Also, the cord is heavy and durable. My only complaint is that the winder almost always needs some finagling to finish winding up the cord. However, I still give the mouse 5 stars."
2,SADLY it doesn't last very long,"The Kensington K72266US Optical Mouse (aka Kensington Ci25m) feels great to the touch and moves very nicely.It worked flawlessly for about 4 months (average of maybe 2 hours per day, as it was not my primary mouse).After 4 months, however, the LEFT button became unresponsive...had to click several times and/or fairly hard to get it to work.Had to buy a new mouse, but anything with a retractable cord looks very 'cheap' and 'fragile'. The Kensington is the most solid-looking unit, therefore, I moved on to a wireless mouse from Logitech."
4,Pretty nice mouse,"This mouse is performing well after ~2 weeks of use. It's not clear from the pics, but it's slightly larger than a typical notebook mouse (i.e. Logitech), kind of half way between a nice sized gaming mouse and a typical notebook mouse. It has nice grips on the sides that are pleasant to the touch. Seems very sensitive from what I can tell, which poses a bit of a problem when using in a vehicle (plane, train, bus). Big pluses are the innovative cord recoiling and the very low profile USB connector.My one long term concern is that the cable is sort of thin and is already showing *some* signs of memory from having been wound up. Not sure how much worse this will get, which is the only reason for 4 stars."
2,I liked it the first 4 months,Worked quite well the first four months but now the right click is almost unresponsive. I have to click it a couple of times for it to work. That means I can't drag windows or highlight things to copy and paste anymore.
2,Broke after 1 year,"Worked great while it lasted. About a year after I bought it, the mouse suddenly failed. I tried it on several computer and clearly the device malfunctioned and refused to be recognized."
5,Excellent mouse,"I bought this to use with my laptop when travelling. It's a little bigger than I had hoped, but worked great after just plugging in. Comfortable to use, would buy again."
1,Way past expiration date!,"I ordered 2 ink cartridges from Amazon that were sold/shipped by Rojak Inc. Both cartridges were 3 years out of date!!!!! They were not in the outer boxes (as you would see them in the store), which would have shown the expiration date, so I had to open them. The expiration date on each cartridge was Sept & Oct of 2009!"
1,Expired,Frustrating to buy a product that is expired. Not worth the savings when an error message constantly pops up on my printer.
3,It works,"+ It prints, it lasts longer then stock cartridge. Does not clogs print heads as OEM pigment based inks.- Does not resist water, not even slightly. One drop ruins entire paper. Still costs more then it's weight in gold."
4,Authentic HP Ink at a good Price,"With all of the prices of ink increasing and all of the imitators out there, it is nice to find Authentic HP Ink at a good price."
3,REPLAY TV DEFECTS,Just bought a Replay TV. The first unit has a defective harddrive. Replay techs stated there are lots of the 2020 models that aredefective. A majority were sent to Amazon.com! nice to hear that. But with a bit of hold time on the phone Amazon.com shipped another one to me overnight air. Customer service is outstanding on amazon and replay tv. P.S. The rumour about macrovision and not being able to record FOX is absolutly false. The macro vision only applies to dumping from TIVO or REPLAY TV to your VCR. It records on replay tv just fine. It looked great while it lasted! I recommend it.
4,Love Pausing live TV!,This is just the product to enable you to answer the door/phone when there is 10 seconds left on the game clock & your team is on the 2 yard line down by 4 points.
5,Great product features !,"Requires some bit of techie know-how to use and that's the only disadvantage it suffers from !Overall, a good trendsetting tech tool for superb viewing pleasure."
2,"Good product, but you'll want a TiVo!","I returned mine and bought a TiVo! TiVo has a much nicer interface and offers many more options...not to mention a better price.ReplayTV lacks even simple digital video controls like slo-motion, and it forces you to clean up recorded programs manually. TiVo has better video controls and manages your disk space better."
2,Behind Tivo,"This is a good product, I would say they will sell millions except at this point the competition (Tivo) is a great product. Remote on Tivo is MUCH better and the unit appears to have more reliable software and you can use it while it updates. Replay appears to lock up while updating."
1,Don't forget toll charges!,Service wound up costing a lot more that Tivo because Replay doesn't have toll free access numbers. The number it dials is long distance for me.I wish I had known this before buying.
2,LSD the guiding light to ReplayTV design...,"We'll overlook the lockups and crashes, continual stream of 20-minute long downloads to update the software (during which you can't watch anything,) and of course the first unit which arrived DOA.Neither me nor the Replay TV tech support staff (accessed after a 45 minute wait on hold) could ever figure out how to simply record a specific channel for a specific period of time. (Wanted to record 30 minutes of headline network news...simply CANNOT be done! They ""code"" HNN as a 3 hour long show!)The menus were designed by an engineer on a bad LSD trip...totally illogical. After watching a show it pops up a help message telling you to delete the program...but do they give you a link to some way to do the delete? Not a chance...grope through the menus yourself. If you have one of these, you are definitely on the BLEADING EDGE.Buy it if you can't wait or you are an entomologist and like bugs."
2,The idea is great but the product is very rough,"You thought your desktop crashed a lot? Well then, just get a Replay TV. With reds being replaced by a blinding bright white, lost recordings, screwy download times that are sometimes totally ineffective, anyone would be better off waiting until they figure this one out. And they will, believe me, because the idea is great. When Replay works as it is supposed to I am aghast at the power it gives the person to create their own programming instead of depending on a bunch of bozos to do it for them. Good product, ain't up to snuff yet. Too darn expensive too.BTW, don't get the shortest recording one, I believe it is the 2020, as you will regret not having the extra space. I have their top of the line and in three weeks already had filled up their hard drive. Forces you to watch your TV too quickly."
1,A great idea on paper...,"I read the press and marketing for almost a year, and then finally talked my wife into letting me buy one.Well, the first thing I noticed was noticably poor video and sound quality.After that I realized that they didn't have a slow-mo button on the remote. I called Customer Service, not a toll free number, and they told me that they don't have slow-mo. I also found out that they don't have frame forward and back. My $180 VCR has those features.Then there were picture blackouts. I would watch a program, and the screen would just go black...I finally gave up and returned the thing. I haven't tried the competitor's machine yet, but I asked for one for Christmas! ;)Maybe they'll get it right next year, but for now, ReplayTV is a lot of hype."
5,A change as big as when VCR's were first available,"This is truly a wonder -- it changes everything. With pause and electronic recording, there is never any searching for a tape, never losing a program or forgetting to turn the VCR power off so the timer can work. And it's a pleasure to watch shows from the beginning even before they've finished airing. This is easily the best electronics gadget I've ever purchased! Bar none!"
5,First real interactvie product,"The setup was relatively simple. The automatic telephone dialup and download of both software and channel guide was flawless. Rcording at High definition worked very well. Download to standard VCR tape was easy. Probably headed for full integration of TV,VCR, and ReplayTV in one self-contained unit."
2,"Good first generation product, but...","It's a very useful product, but it's got some rough edges and lacks some features that the TiVo offering has.I ordered a ReplayTV before I knew about TiVo and was generally pretty happy with it, but once I was able to play with a friend's TiVo, I returned my Replay.Since these ""digital recorders"" are new products, by very young companies I'm sure they will both improve over time, but right now TiVo appears to be a nicer design.Plus I was a little disappointed when I received my first ""message"" on my ReplayTV that said we could expect ads to be displayed on the selection grid. I get enough banner ads on web pages, thank you very much!"
5,How did I live without it?,I work crazy hours but I love TV. ReplayTV makes it possible for me to watch my shows when I want. I love the commercial skip feature. This is so much more personalized than a VCR. I really recommend it. This would be a great christmas gift!
2,Replay 2020 discontinued?,"I love this new technology - it really has changed the way I view television!I love my Replay TV but I have to send it back because it keeps crashing!I thought the Replay 2020 (20 hours rec) was a better deal than the Phillips Tivo (14 hour version)?Why? Six more hours of rec time and a hundred dollars cheaper! ($400 for Replay + free service, $300 for Tivo + $200 for the lifetime service)And so it was all settled - that is until my Replay started its daily crashing ritual!So I called Amazon to exchange it for a new one, but instead they offered me a refund, because they say the 2020 is being discontinued.They assured me, however, that the new 3030 model, which records an extra 10 hours for an extra $200, is free of the defects of the 2020!I use the word free lightly.By the way, that's the same price as Tivo's 30 hour version with the service included.And Tivo has a cute little man with a TV on his head!"
3,Repaly vs Tivo...,Tivo I tried both and I like Tivo better the way the remote feels and it easier to browse through the programming.I wish that the DirecTV gride of programmings had the hard disk drive of the TIVO and it would be perfect combination ( It will be done I know SONY is working towards the integration of the TIVO and the DirecTv in their next generation of DSS Receivers.)
5,Must have for tight schedules!,"Believe it or not, I won my ReplayTV from Amazon.com. It sat in the living room for 2 months before I had time to install it. Then I had to go to HomeDepot and buy one of those plug-in phone extenders that use the house's wiring so the unit could dial-in to get those FREE updates. It worked like a charm the first time. Took a few days for me to get used to it, mostly because I had the old operating sytem, which was updated for FREE when I dialed in on the first night. I cannot tell you how nice it is to type in the name of a show or actor and get what I want. Say good-bye to commercials and pause live TV when the kids need to go to bed or work calls. This is a must have for the person on the go who has a couple of shows they don't want to miss (or 20 hours worth) - but always do. Sci-Fi or Sports fanatics will never sleep again."
4,Everything I want when I want it!,"I've had my unit for 24 hours now and I can already see that it have a much more radical effect on the way I watch television that I thought it would.Picture quality is good at standard quality (20 hours), excellent at medium quality, and indistinguishable from commercial video tape at high quality (no DVD player to compare it to). I didn't realize just how big a deal the ability to time shift programming would be to me. Sure, I expected to take advantage of the ability to start watching Law & Order from the beginning 20 minutes after it started (once I got the kids to bed), but I didn't realize just how much good stuff I was missing out on that airs late night.My only wish would be for a time-channel-duration recording option from time to time, say to catch a sporting event that may run long compared to the listed times.Other than that, this unit is nearly perfect. The best [money] I ever spent on a piece of home entertainment equipment."
3,"Good, but...","I have had my replaytv for two weeks now, and I like it very much. However... the replaytv is just about worthless without accurate tv listings. I have found errors in my listings and have tried, in vain, to get them changed. TV Quest (Tribune) does the listings for replaytv. When you go to their website (as I was instructed to do by replay) and send correcitons to TV Quest, all you get back is an automated response saying they are too busy to help. This is really pissing me off! Hopefully TV Quest and Replay will get their collective acts together. Until then, beware of this problem."
3,Improving Reading: A Handbook of Strategies,This is a book that I am going to use in my classroom to help me determaine strategies to use with struggling readers.
5,Best wire stripper available,"I have owned one of these for nine years and love it. I am a machine tool electrician so I strip a high volume of wires on a daily basis. This tool will make a nice clean cut, then a perfect strip without changing tools. It is indispensable when working with ferrules because the strip length is constant, allowing you to make uniform connections quickly. I recently misplaced mine and am now searching for the best deal to buy another one. I am certain I will not be without it for long. This one is light weight, comfortable, and durable. By far the best wire stripper I have ever used and I highly recommend it to anyone who wires on a regular basis."
1,junk,"this thing is terrible,i just bought it cuz it had good reviews,took it to work and it couldnt strip wire,its hard to squeeze and leaves marks on the wire,it could not strip 24 ga. wire without taking most of the strands with it, and it didnt even try to strip wire with rubber insulation all it did was chew it up,i tried every setting on it and no help,i have to strip alot of wire where i work on was really hoping this would be great,what a let down,im returning it and gonna try a different one"
3,"Good , but I don't know about the notes.",I have to reserve final judgment until I teach from this text. Looks a good edition. I like the size of the book
5,Yummy!,"This soup is some good stuff! Fills you up too, so its like a whole meal in a can! I like to eat it with a buttered bagel. Also try the Chicken and Dumplings flavor, its the best!"
1,Worst nail brush ever.,"The bristles are not firm enough to get under your fingernails. Plus one side does not have slanted bristles to get under your fingernails. The worst thing, however, is that it SHEDS. Don't buy. However, if you just want a hand brush, it'll work, but it still sheds."
3,I hope you like reggae,This movie is short. And every single song is reggae. That's not exaggerating. There is some good skiing though. Jah rule da wooorld!
4,Wears at least once a week,"My son loves his ""Sportacus clothes""! Although, the hat fits a little weird,actually the hat doesn't stay on his head at all. Maybe if the goggles were included in our package, they could help the hat stay in place. We ended up buying swim goggles instead."
3,good quality pricy shipping,"My boy has really enjoyed the costume. The goggles don't have a good quality, and they won't stay on place, but everything else is decent.I still think the shipping was really pricey."
2,Poor quality,I am disapponited from this item and i don't advise any to experience the same. The quality was very poor and my kid just wear once and then has just through it.
5,Good for a romantic sap like me,"""Zanna, Don't!"" has to be one of the sweetest romantic musicals I've ever heard! It's a heartmelting love story in a ""twisted"" world where chess is the sexy sport, and there is a big issue about ""heterophobia"".You will LOVE this CD if you like: Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, Moulin Rouge, and just about any gay love story.Yes, it might be cheesey, but it's the cutest little thing. It's fun, and it's catchy! All romantics have to buy this!"
5,Absolutely delightful!,"I had the pleasure of seeing this fine show twice during its brief off-off-Broadway run and again during its off Broadway run. Every song is delightful and memorable. Although I normally despise music described as ""uplifting,"" this CD always makes me feel happier and more hopeful about life without being saccharine or simplistic. The entire collection is wonderful, and the show was even more so."
2,"fun, but gets old quickly...","When I first heard of this musical, I was excited due to the fact that Jai Rodriguez is the star and i'm a huge fan of his. And I have to say, when I got the cd, I was obsessed with it for a few weeks (like I usually am with new musicals). But when I went back to it after a break, the charm had worn off. The premise is imaginative, but the songwriting definitely leaves someting to be desired. While the songs are catchy and singable at first, they kind of lose their luster as you begin to realize what they're saying (like the word ""love"" about a hundred times throughout the show), and that the music is less than stellar. So much could've been done with this premise that the songs don't seem to express.I do love the energy and the youth of this musical, and I do listen to it from time to time, however it doesn't rank high on my list of wonderful musicals."
3,mandarin trvel pk,"Compared to berlitz edition in cassette tape years ago, this CD edition does not have many things to praise:While the whole world use PINYN to help foreigners pronounce Chinese words and phrases, Berlitz keeps on using strange notations, perhaps to facilitate the reading of Cantonese, but not mandarin.The previous cassette edition showed the pronunciation and intonation more Beijing-like.In the previous cassette edition, there were more/longer pause, so the student could repeat the chinese phrase at ease."
1,Disappointing and useless,"For a Berlitz product this is very disappointing and nearly useless pack. My main issue is that Berlitz replaced the pinyin system with their own ""simplified phonetic transcription. Nobody said Chinese is an easy language to learn, but if one follows Berlitz ""simplified phonetic transcription"" they are completely wasting their time and money!!"
4,IF you have an old Dirt Devil - These are the bags,We did not think that we could find bags for the old dirt devil because the last bag was thown out before a number could be found. These bags worked great in the 1996 vintage dirt devil.
5,All Is Well,"Product arrived quickly and as advertised. Excellent service, quality of product. It's nice to find an online business that stocks vacuum cleaner bags that are difficult to find in retail stores. All is well with this purchase."
4,bought this for the wife!,"my wife said to buy these, so i did. they came quite quickly, the packaging was fine. she's happy so i'm happy."
5,new purchase,"I was so relieved to find this online since I was unable to find the bags in our local stores and I LOVE my Dirt Devil. Price was great, shipping was quick. I would purchase from this vendor again."
3,Can't really give this a fair rating,I purchased this item as an add on for a Vacuum I ordered and they don't go with that Vacuum! I am sure they work fine but it is very frustrating that Amazon made the wrong pairing.
3,Dirt Devil vac bags,Sucks to have to use bags in the small handheld vac. The older models did not need bags and were much more economical.
1,Once a NUT always a NUT,"This lady is crazy and her poor children, I only read a few pages standing in a book store and I put it down, I do not own this nor would I ever buy it. I am not letting this horrible lady or her publicist benefit one dime from me. She killed her children, plain and simple and she knew what she was doing."
2,WHAT A MAD WOMAN,"THIS BOOK DEPICTS THE ONE SIDED ACCOUNT THAT DIANE DOWNS, CLAIMING SHE DID NOTHING WRONG IN EUGENE, OREGON. I RECALL THIS WHOLE MESS STARTING BACK IN THE EARLY 1980'S AND IT WAS ONE OF THE STRANGEST THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN LANE COUNTY, OREGON BECAUSE I LIVED IN SPRINGFIELD, OREGON AT THE TIME AND NOT ONLY DO I HOPE THE CHRISTIE AND DANNY ARE LEADING THE BEST LIFE POSSIBLE. THE BOOK IS JUST SOMETHING TO AIDE HER AND THATS ALL."
1,stupid reviewer,"this is to the reviewer ""Bun-Hun"". did we read the same book? either you have never read the newspapers or ""cruel sacrifices"" by anne rule, or you are an ignorant fool. or perhaps you haven't lived long enough to have the insight into what makes anti-social people tick. this book is self serving drivel. of course, diane has the ""right"" to her opinion, she opens herself up to people seeing her for what she is: liar, murderer, torturer, criminal, monster. this book reminds me of ""the emporers new clothes"". only diane can't (or won't) see herself for what she is, and expects that no one else can see what is real. ""Bun-Hun"", that the lord you were not on that jury."
2,Curosity killed the cat,"I read this because I have read and seen the accounts of Diane Downes and her crime. Although, I have always believed that she is guilty some of the points she made regarding how her case was handled made sense-in the beginning. By the last page, her desperate grasping and self made conclusions as to why she convicted were those of a mentally disturbed person who views the whole world as one big conspiracy against her. Everything she says is about HER."
2,not up to the new standard,"When I watch this movie in a theater in the late 70', I remember liked it very much. Back then ,there was not many Kung Fu movies I can watch. Based on that excellent souvenir, I bought the DVD and watch it again. After having seen, Crouching Tiger, Hero, Flying Daggers, Red Cliff and other excellent movies, I'm very disappointed by this movie"
3,very good but definantly not a 5 star...,"i liked the story and acting more then i liked the sword play in this one. even though the blade ti lung uses is sick, the swordplay wasnt all that impressive. full moon scimitar, supreme swordsman and silver spear were better in my opinion....."
2,A used book indeed....,"This book was marked as used and in good condition when I ordered it, so I knew there would be some flaws. However the book arrived really dirty and with crumbs in the binding. I spent 10 mins wiping the book off with a wet paper towel and I was able to get alot of the dirt off. The book served it's purpose for what I needed it for, but it didn't give me a very good impression of the seller. Why would you send someone a book that dirty? USED does not mean dirty."
5,I can't believe I only bought one!,"This cherub statue was a hit at my house. People asked me where the other one was, so I am back to buy another. The quality is fabulous and I am very pleased with my purchase."
5,The Best Show Ever!,Jumong is an amazing adventure series. Its as addicting as day time soap operas only better quality and amazing mysticism and story telling qualities that make you sit on the edge of your seat to see what happenes next.
5,Love Korean dramas!,These are great to watch when you've had too much sex and violence from American TV. I loved this entire series. It was worth it to watch all four volumes. I dreamed about archery after watching this.
4,Great book!,"I loved using this book with my Pre-teen girls class. If you want to get your girls into the Word, and to begin to build a solid foundation of who God is, and who your girls are to Him, this is the book for you. I am a college student, and only had one assistant who is also a college student, so we changed the curriculum up a bit from the ""grandma-mentor"" scenario that's recommended, but it worked out great for us. The girls had fun, and grew in Christ so much! I would recommend this curriculum to anyone."
5,Gem in a Nutshell,"Wonderfully concise vignettes of the Bach essences that include details on preparation, understanding, and using the remedies. Suitable for beginners and experienced alike."
5,Amazing,I miss this show I found it by accident and had to buy it for my sister brings back a lot of memories
5,"Better than expected, but...","Not the same intro I remember, picture flickers a bit. However, good picture sharpness and sound; packaging seemed to be sturdy and sound quality was good. No audio options for other languages. But, I would buy this again."
5,saxophone madness,I just want to second the two other eloquent reviewers. I am amazed that as late as Vol. 14 there is still so much exquisite music to be found in the archives of Ethiopian Pop. And to think I was ready to stop with Vol. 10! Sometimes this music is hallucinatory. And the organ sounds! Indispensable.
3,Fading star. Not a long-lasting or memorable scent,"I bought a bottle of True Star EDT at an airport Duty-Free shop a couple of years ago and rarely ever apply it. It's got a great look to the bottle and cap, but the fragrance just isn't very strong and it isn't long-lasting. It fades in an hour or two and isn't a very distinct scent.The other problem is that the shiny metallic cap has an inner plastic piece glued to the inside that cups tightly over the dispenser nozzle. The glue on my cap came off after repeated use, so now the cap is in two pieces.If you're looking for a youthful, light, and excellent-smelling fragrance, I recommendL'eau D'issey By Issey Miyake For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Ouncesinstead. It has a much more pronounced citrusy scent that lasts for hours. I've always gotten compliments on my Issey. Never for True Star."
2,thin,"This is the same thing snapopon sells for thirtyfivebux. Glass tube is super thin and fragile. It worked good for the one day I used it, then I was rinsing it out with water and broke it. Thexxton makes a nice plastic flat tube one with 4 floating discs, but not as accurate. Then ezredd makes one that has a floating pointer I'm going to try next."
4,good buy,"i always buy my gadgets on amazon and it never fails to meet my expectation. I bought this camera few weeks ago and i am so glad i did it. I'm not whiz on cameras but this particular brand is really a great deal, u got 2 lenses for a good price, what more to ask?. I am still figuring out the ins and outs of it,but i'd tell you that this camera is smart. Easy to use, worth the bucks. Good as a gift or for personal use. When u have one , you'll figure out yourself and fall into it."
4,Smaller SLR with my e-410,"In my view before you buy, you must understand 2 things: smaller SLRs and it's good for travel.I've had e-410 system about 2 weeks.It made it easy for me to carry it.It seems to produce the good picture / good image but some picture wasn't good because i try to take a good picture ;-).(the battery performance was very good )The 40-150 len is very good for me.It used for tele picture.Overall ,I would say this is a resonable price...and the telephoto lens is very good.=================Sarayut YooinThailandCons. Last weekend I took it to a birthday party at night.The images was bad because i didn't have the external flash.Maybe the external flash is is important for you"
1,Do Not Buy This Product,This was a Holiday Gift for someone who was only in the country for a brief period. When she charged and inserted the battery it did not work. The camera could never be turned on. It was returned. I bought a Nikon for her the next day and am happy with it. I would never buy Olympus again.I can't comment on the seller since I have not yet received a credit for the returned camera.
4,Olympus Evolt E410- an affordable choice with a good quality,This is an affordable choice for an DSLR camera with a certain quality.Especially for whom are interested in underwater photography like myself this is a pretty good option if you consider the housing price as well.
4,Love this game,"For being old school system and not to much to this game I freakin love this game. Like I said there is no to much to this game you are an angel flying around shooting things, for being so simple of a lay out for a game. It not easy to doge the 20 thousand things flying, falling or exploding at once, while trying to get your power ups. The grapics on this game are not so bad for an older game as well."
1,"I do so hate re-reading the same thing, over and over again.","I was shocked at just how awful this book is. Each chapter is basically one of the five main characters going through some trial--and the next four chapters are how the other characters have done exactly the same thing. Awful. A bore. Hard to get through. It was like trudging through a book of Organic Chemistry. Now, I love Sharon Green. I adored her Mida series and I /love/ the Warrior Within. This woman can write. Each chapter is well written--Just, I can not comprehend why she felt she had to right the exact same thing over, in five different ways?"
4,This isn't Convergence but its worth a read,"Don't believe that this book is bad! It happens to be really entertaining and light hearted.-At first. Pace is kept really good and steady. As well as introducing you to new characters. While new characters are slightly too typical Delin and Kambil are gifts to characacter development. The repition of mastery tests are annoying, but better then the repitions in Convergence. So read this book, but don't expect things to heat up yet. That only really happens in Challenges and the beginning of Betrayals."
2,"Green talented plot developer, needs help with her style.","I am frustrated that I like this book, because now I am compelled to finish the trilogy. Sharon Green has a talent for creating engaging characters and an intriguing plot, but her style tends to be tedious. Green attempts to narrate the story from each characters' point of view without success. Each character repeats details of their experiences which are excruciatingly similar. By the climax of this story, readers can easily predict the actions of each character. If Green changed her narrative stance to a more omniscient narrator, perhaps the telling would be less tedious."
3,"Received wrong pattern, but I like it!","Love the flatware, even though it was the more contemporary pattern that is open in the center. Not what I ordered, but it's great quality."
1,Don't buy these if you want a nice item,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this flatware set. There are scratches on some of the item. The forks have rough edges where the tines were cut in. If postage wasn't so high on returning, I would be sending these back! If you want a so so item for camping or to have kids play in the dirt with, then consider these!"
1,I didn't even order this,I went on and looked at it and put it in my shopping cart and then closed out because I didn't want it. Next thing I knew you had already charged it to my credit card. It is very cheap looking and poorly made.
1,Extremely LOW Quality,"My fiancee and I took them out of the box, looked at them for 30 seconds and immediately noticed the low quality finish with sharp edges and clear machine marks on the edges and corners of virtually every spoon and fork. Knives looked fine, but I'm sure if we held on to them long enough, we would have found flaws with them. Immediately put them back in the box and sent them back to amazon."
2,"Nice for the price, but....","Well worth the price, but it arrived horribly packaged, and horribly scratched up.For new flatware, I would expect it not to have been scratched up regardless of the price.Just glad it was nt for a gift."
2,"Bland, dingy, but cheap","These look nice in the photo but don't be fooled... there's a reason these only cost $15! They arrived dingy, scratched up, packed in a makeshift hand-made box that originally housed some kind of rags by the label, and looking like they came from a second-hand store. The Amazon photo makes it look like they're a nice satin silver finish but the real thing is a flat, bland grey with a style that screams, ""I stole these from Denny's!""For a utilitarian outdoor dining set, college students on a budget, those restocking your low-brow diner, or for anyone who simply don't care what they eat with as long as it's not plastic, these will do. But don't expect to get more than what you pay for."
2,Decent everyday flatware.,Not the best stuff you'll ever use but good enough for every day. Was quite a deal for the set when I bought it.
2,Would not buy this as a gift,Worth for the money you spend. But the box it came is not pretty. If you are planning on giving this as a gift forget about it. It comes in a small card board box.
4,"Tough to read, but worth it","I'm one of those women who have the super painful cramps and PMS that makes you think there isn't such thing as a ""happy period."" My OB-GYN harped on me for two years to buy this book before I finally gave it. And it was a good investment.This isn't always an easy read, but it contains a lot of good information on the science and phyiology of the menstrual cycle and the issues that came come from it. Some of it seems to be common sense, but where this book stands out is that it offers charts for tracking symptoms, suggestions for making sense of what you are feeling, and information on what to do with all of it. It also addresses the mental and emotional aspects and fallout.I recommend this book for women who are in that ""in between"" zone where the diagnosis is vague and managing symptoms seems to be the key."
5,User-friendly,"I have read many books related to this subject but this one has to be the top of my list. It is an easy read with practical examples that everyone can relate to. I really enjoyed the ""down to earth"" approach of the book and recommend it highly."
5,"Jean Drew, Author","Wow! This is a must for anyone serious about creating a better future. It can change lives. Mine certainly started to change after the first read. I'm now on my second.You deserve abundance, prosperity, wealth and anything else you want. I've read a lot of books on this subject and never really understood some of what they say. But Sandy Forster makes it so easy to read and understand.A terrific book. Don't leave here without one."
5,Wow - what a book,"I can truly say that in the six months since I read this book my life has changed dramatically. If the ideas are completely new to you, they may seem a little strange at first but as you read through the pages you will understand why you have not succeeded in the past and learn how to make small changes in the way you think that will change your life forever. Be careful - after putting into practice what this book teaches your life will never be the same!"
1,"Sorry, I disagree.","Yes, I read the entire book. A much, much better book is Professional Dreamer. The Abraham-Hicks books are weird, I returned the one I ordered. This one includes every wealth trick you can think of... but also inlcludes frugality and debt chapters, turning your thinking to just that, which is counterproductive. If we are wealthy and we are as we think we are wealthy, we do not need to think like a poor man, about our debts or how many pennies we can save."
4,Not much I haven't heard before but still worth reading,There are a lot of repackaging of old ideas in this book but the authors presentation is infectious (and to be fair there are few ideas here I haven't heard of before). Some of the principles the author mentions I know to be effective. I think what carries over in this book though is the genuine enthusiasm of the author. Sometimes it takes a new voice to get some of the known principles of success in business through. Some might indeed find this book a revelation.
5,Amazing. I finally got a Clue!,"I've read numerous books on attracting wealth and Sandy knows what she's talking about. The one tidbit that took me over the edge and made it all start happening for me is that, you not only focus on what you want more than you focus on what you don't want, but that you do it , at least, 51% of the time! Thank-you Sandy for spelling it out :o)"
5,I LOVE MONEY AND MONEY LOVE ME!!!,Sandy genuinely wants you to become a Wildly Wealthy Winner; she gives 100% of herself. And really cares & shares ...The book comes from the heart you will feel the love and excitement.Sandy teaches that being excited being grateful and saying affirmations can change your life...yes it can be that easy...It is our right have Abundance Prosperity Wealth and MoneyI am truly grateful to have found this book.If you really want to turn your life around read this book become a money magnet too......
5,living torah dvd jewish,"I love this dvd, moved me closer to my faith, and what I want to do in life. I intend to purchase more of thise dvd's. love the free shipping"
3,Not his best,"I read all of Reynolds Price. This novel is a puzzle. I read it in three big gulps, all in one day; I wanted to see what happened next. I have two issues: first, Price spins out set pieces, interactions between (usually) Noble and another person and then tells the reader how Noble felt--there's a big disconnect between narrative of encounter and reported (versus shown) feelings. Second, there is an Oedipal fixation on sex and death as well as sex in general. My hope is that women who read this book would realize that this is one fictional character, and that not all men are as equally obsessed with their erotic lives."
1,What were they thinking!,"I decided to read this book after seeing it listed on the USA Today book club. And boy was I disappointed! Perosnally, I found the book very hard to read. I consider my self fairly intelligent and found myself rereading many times, somethin that does not make reading enjoyable. And a few times, I still didn't get what was being said. I also thought that the story and plot were rather dull. I will admit that the first chapter was pretty good, but it went down hill very quickly. To be honest I was very disappointed that the author did not go into further detail when he discussed Noble's ""relationships and encounters."" While I was not expecting smut, I feel it would have added to the story."
3,One can only chuckle sadly,"- at yet another politically driven ""expose"" of the ""Soviet failure."" One example from Brovkin's subchapter - ""Was there an NEP?"" - will suffice. Here he gloats that the main fault of the Soviet economic system was its ""socialism,"" ie, state ownership. Managers were encouraged into irresponsibility knowing the state would not let them fail. ""At no time,"" Brovkin writes, ""did NEP operate under market conditions.""Fast forward some ninety years. Free market western capitalism survives its latest crash only through massive government props, because its private institutions can't be allowed to fail. CEOs are encouraged in their wasteful, thriftless, and exorbitant behavior knowing that the state safety net is there to catch them - and thereby reducing Brovkin's smug analysis of ""the Soviet failure"" to academic dust. That this work is highly endorsed by the Wall Street Journal underscores the irony."
5,Beautiful CD,"John Astin has a calm, cool, collected style about his lyricsand melodies. Easy-listening for sure. Thank you very much, John!"
3,It is OK - Worth the price,The book did not have as many ideas for me as I would have liked. It was still worth the price.
2,Boring!!!,"This movie is not anything like the book. The acting was not bad , but the story is just slow and boring!"
5,I loved it!,"Even though this production was my cousin, Daniel Lee Robertson's first movie, I'm not going to be biased. I loved it!!!Congrats Dan Dan!"
3,Almost great,"I bought this for my long-haired German Shepherd. It worked great, then the handle separated from the head. We drilled a hole in the handle and inserted a cotter-pin. Works fine, now."
5,Amazing study how to see Jesus in every piece of the tabernacle.,"This study will make leave you speechless. I enjoyed this so workbook much I bought it again. Arthur's studies are great because the verses are contained in the booklet so you can take this on the go and do them at lunch, park, etc. Highly recommend all of Arthur's studies!"
3,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I expected this album to be full of smokin' guitar work, but instead I got crappy country ballads(I Want To Hear It From You, Darlin' I'll Do Anything You Say). The just plain stupid ""Hong Kong Blues"", and a terrible attempt of a pop tune, ""Venom Wearin' Denim. On the plus side there's the jaw-dropping ""I Hung It Up"", the funny ""Joe the Singin' Janitor"" and track one (I forgot it's name). ""Surf Medly"" is good too. Guitar players if you're still looking for that great country guitar album go with The Hellecasters' ""The Return of the Hellecasters"", and Danny Gatton's awesome ""88 Elmira Street""."
5,good guitar music,I bought this CD for one song I heard on a Juke Box in a restaurant and was pleasantly surprised with the rest of it even though it isn't my usual genre preference.
3,junior,Great artist! I woud recomend this to all music lovers. Junior Brown i have missed you glad to find it
5,a must listen,"Yes, this is as good or better than everyone says. The music is very lively, and makes for great listening no matter whether you are into Irish traditional music or not. I am a big fan of Tommy Peoples as well as Kevin Burke, and I consider it a big plus to have them both here on the same CD (although not together on the same tunes). I really don't have much to add to what the other reviewers have already said, except that I agree with the good things, and I recommend this as a CD you will listen to again and again."
4,"Great, but there's one that beats the rest","I really enjoyed this album, but, as the previous reviewer said, the tracks are present on the other ones. I still think Out of the Wind and into the Sun is the best Bothy Band album ever, when their magic is fully demonstrated."
5,Great Album. Get it. Now.,"I find myself humming these songs in the oddest places, days after listening to the album."
3,More of a showroom,"More fun to see it as a showrroom; not much to play with. I'd spend money on a track that kids can race cars on. I got this for my father-in-law to play with the kids. He's a car collector so this was right up his alley. The kids don't get so much use out of it, though."
3,If the three parts are all you are looking for its worth it,"If the basic reference collection is all you want, this is definitely worth it. You can easily find what you want and Libronix is a very useful search engine. However, the other resources that this CD contains are locked and you must pay fees to unlock them. That is why I rated it at 3 stars. It is worth the money if you are only looking for the basic reference collection."
5,I just couldn't put it down...,Rarely have I found a book that I just pick up and can't put down. But this book is one. I bought this along with 2 other books yesterday at a seminar that I spoke at and scanned through them all. This book caught my attention. I started reading it on the plane ride back home and had it finished by the time I landed. I was so impressed - I emailed Melivn to see if he is open to chat on the phone for 1 hour consultation. I'd be willing to pay him what ever he wants for that short period of time.Matt BacakAuthor of The Ultimate Lead Generation Planand Secrets of the Internet Millionaire Mind
2,A Cesspool of Classified Advertising Information,"The information is in there, but good luck trying to dig it out. Rarely have I seen such a disorganized, unfocused, hard-to-use compilation of information as this. This manual could be so much better organized and presented. Honestly, I was very disappointed. After reading all of the ""glowing"" reviews I expected a much more well-written book. Final Grade: D-"
3,Middle of the road,This book started out strong but lost me in the middle. I cheered Ruby her accomplishments but I was disappointed that she wasn't allowed to enjoy her life at all! After growing up in hell and overcoming many obstacles she never got to enjoy the fruits of her labor. Her relationship with her two longtime friends was unrealistic. As was her relationship with her two sisters. They were on again off again and the characters of the sisters didn't really have any substance. The part after the funeral of her father really disappointed me as well. I feel that there were a few parts of the story that didn't really belong and she could have just left those out completely. I do love the rags to riches and underdog type theme of Ms. Michaels books!
2,Wilted Roses,"Not all book reviews have to be nice. Nor do they have to be exciting. I do feel that I should share my personal feelings about this particular book.Fern Michaels did a wonderful job in the Texas saga. I truly enjoyed those books. I would have liked to believe that the rest of her books would be half as good. I was truly disappointed with Seasons of Her life.I didnt like it much. The book was generally good to begin with and then it died in the middle. Fern seems to have tried giving it life support, but when the book had been braindead for that long.... it became a vegetable."
4,"Seasons of her Life, Fern Michaels",I bought this for my daughter as I'd already read it. It's an excellent book. She's reading it now and loves it.
5,Absolutely the best book I have ever read!,"Seasons of Her life by Fern Michaels has to have been written by an author that lived it. You laugh & cry & cry some more. You feel like just getting into the book & hurting some of the people. One of the best books I've ever read, if not the best. You relate it to people in your own life. If your lucky you have people like Ruby in your life & not many people do. To recap it's the best book I have ever read."
5,Excelent Backpack,"This backpack is just that I was looking for. It has many pockets that you can use to store hearphones, cds, presentation cards, pen, and other usefull thing, my HP Pavilion TX 1320UX, fits in perfect.The only issue is that has not space for many stuffs. If you want to carry only your laptop is perfect for it.Don't hesitate in buy it.Sorry for my english."
1,Save your packaging and receipts,"I loved the backpack the first few times that I used it.Then after one month and very few uses, the shoulder strapsbegan falling apart. The stiching fell out on both.Other than the straps which hold the pack to your back, it'sgreat. But why then would you buy a backpack?"
2,"uncomfortable, heavy, feels bulky & doesn't hold much","I use a lightweight laptop for portability & so I like backpacks to be comfortable and light. Somehow it feels like quite a load when carrying it & people have commented to me that it even ""looks heavy"". It also feels rigid and bulky and it barely holds more than a laptop and power cord. On the other hand with all that bulk, there's no doubt it will protect your laptop."
4,"Good for your 14"" Laptops","I am using this for almost 1 year and till now I didnt face any issue. I travel by metro for my work and this bag has sustained that.If you are looking to add books, food etc.. then this may not suite you due to the compact size."
2,Not completely satisfied,"I love the style, the look, and especially LOVE the compartments. However, there is minimal room to actually store things. As a result of the lack of space, I have traveled with it very heavily packed (and yet nothing unreasonable). To my dissatisfaction, the front corner is starting to come apart."
1,Good Design..Bad Quality,"I liked this bag...its much sturdier than most other laptop bags. However, after a year and a half the zipper has broken as well as the hand strap. I've had laptop bags last much longer than this."
4,puff the magic dragon,"This tape contains wonderful songs and messages of hope for young and old alike. Songs such as ""weave me the sunshine,"" for example contain lyrics ""weave weave weave me the sunshine out of the falling rain, we me some hope for a new tomorrow, and fill my cup again!"" Jackie Paper starts off unhappy due to normal childhood fears, that are not rational to adults, and Puff helps him through a self-realization process. There is a second film about a baby cloud that is temporarily lost from its parents; there is a happy ending though."
5,What a addicted songs!,"When you listen once to these songs, then you can't stop. The voices of the singers are really very good and the lyrics superb. If you like Spanish music, these two discs are for you."
5,Perfect Reunion!,"Get together OT2001 and OT2002 was the most wonderful idea of Gestmusic Endemol and TVE, this CD has fantastic voices like Rosa, Chenoa, Manu Tenorio, Nuria Fergo, Beth, Manuel Carrasco, Joan Tena and MUCH more!!!"
1,Sphinter,"Disgusting paranoia we find in this terrorific gang of headless weirdos who destry every furniture in the room and attack every sense of art into the earthly globe. I can telya if ya buy this bunch of pornographic miserablia you will be fenced to the top of a wire which is right into the bottom. Try betta Andreas Vollenweider, Mike Oldfield, Wayne Gratz, Joe Satriani, Stephen Caldwell, Roy Orbison, Torrebruno, David Hasselhof, Demis Roussos, Nana Moskouri, Frank Sinatra, Frank Zappa, Hank Marvin, Jakob Dylan or even Sting. Get all the Operational Tronfo to the bin and see it all burning, 'cos that fire brings freedom and choice for the nice people: we all."
5,Great Sword cleaner,"This here will help prevent and rust on your guns or swords. I myself use it on my sword here and there to polish and remove any oils on it. After using it properly it's nice and shiny! Thank you for making such a great product, and I see why Navy Seals use it!I would recommend anyone who cares about there weapons to use this item too. It only takes a couple minutes not even to wipe down my sword and leave it with a sparkle. After using the product I'd recommend to wash your hands, as soon as possible, because what ever is on the cloth goes onto your hands and doesn't smell very good. To sum it all up, buy this product, and you will not regret it."
3,I'm Not Sure,"Tuf-Cloth, 12 x 12 in., EachI'm not sure about this product. I used it on one of my glocks and it stripped it of oils and turned the slide white. I then used ballistol on it and brought it back to it's previous condition. I don't know if I'll use it again or not."
1,Abysmal,"This long and erudite book I found to be incredibly confusing and boring, despite its belonging to four of my favorite genres: horror, fantasy, vampires, erotic. I am an avid reader owning thousands of books, have a master's in literature, but found the plot impossible to follow. The constant negating of statements by qualifying them with alternative ""truths"" or outright dismissal was irritating. Nevertheless, the themes of the book, which I believe to be disparagement of a highly technical, entertainment-obsessed, media-led society came through loud and clear. The sexy scenes were more sick than erotic. It reminded me of a symphony with a recurrent melody and motif but lacking transition and logic."
3,not up to par,"I had much higher hopes for this dvd that weren't really fulfilled, I love all of David Lynch's work, and i had heard about these short films many times, but until this dvd had came out i had never seen them. I found that most of these were just boring. They also seemed like half formed ideas. The only ones i found interesting were The Grandmother and Lumiere, i really liked the latter. The other ones i found were just kind of boring."
3,"Does not work with Apple 30"" Display","Theres pages on the web where it says that the PNY Verto 6600GT is a cheap solution to power an Apple 30"" Display with 2560 x 1600 pixels. It looks like this current version of the graphics card is different from older versions, and does not have the TMDS chip anymore to supply dual-link DVI. There have been version of the PNY Verto 6600GT that had two DVI ports, the new ones have 1 DVI and 1 VGA port. I just bought one off amazon, but it doesnt supply 2560 x 1600 to power my Apple 30"", so unfortunately I have to return it. I just write this review so not somebody else runs into the same problem. Cheers!"
2,Not what I expected as a long-time fan,"I've been a fan since JH and was hoping this would be the CD with ""Brown Eyes""...where IS this song??"
2,This is David Cassidy??,"I like the music David Cassidy did with the Partridge Family and his earlier solo work. I have literally been a fan of his since I was in grade school.HOWEVER, on this album he sounds like Cher with a bad head cold. I read somewhere that he was ""experimenting with his voice"" when these tracks were done. Thank goodness he didn't like the sound, either."
1,Eeek,"I can only say that whoever persuaded David Cassidy to cover Gene Pitney's ""Half Heaven, Half Heartache"" did him no favors. David has a pleasant enough voice. Pitney's is phenomenal, and so emotion-soaked that you just should not go there as a cover artist. I invite you folks to check the original (plenty of Gene P. albums have a clip of it right here on Amazon) and hear for yourselves. If David is uncomfortable with this set (as I gathered from other posts), it may be because of things like this. They might as well have asked him to cover ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"" with equal conviction to the original. Any takers on that one? Same situation here."
3,It's ok.,I bought it because I love David in the Partridge Family but I really just like the songs from the show. So it was not a really good CD for me but if you like Davids songs that have nothing to do with the show than it is a good buy.
2,"Nothing ""Classic"" about these ""Songs""","Originally recorded in the '80's for Curb records, this incomplete (by 5 songs!) re-release of mediocre material is saved by the decent ""Strengthen My Love,"" which was only heard in the States on a ""Partridge Family"" and ""My Three Sons"" reunion special. The sweet ""Half Heaven, Half Heartache"" is reminiscent of the P.F. sound but everything else is a disapointment. ""I Think I Love You"" was not a part of the original album, which did eventually see the light of day in Japan a few years back under the misleading title, ""Best of David Cassidy."""
3,Great music scores for an album with obscure music!,"David was going to release an album in 1979, but was never released and these songs are great! He felt like these songs didn't represent his music, probably because most of these tracks are cover songs. The track I thought that represented his music is ""Half Heaven, Half Heartache"", which he has great vocal harmonies in! Another one is ""Once a Fool"", of which he tries to attempt at doing disco. ""Crazy Love"" and ""Dirty Work""(written by one of the Gibb brothers from the Bee Gees) are fairly good too. The songs that are wimpy though are ""Hurt So Bad""(that was released as a single, but failed to reach the charts), ""Stengthen My Love"", and ""I Can See Everything."""
3,Title is misleading - Unreleased cuts that had been shelved,"This 30 min. shorty has absolutely nothing to do with the Partridge Family, other than the title cut and tune. These are early David Cassidy expansion tunes that also bare little resemblance to ""Cherish"" and ""Rock Me Baby"". Still, a few nice cuts. Seems from day one, David was constantly testing the waters and altering his style - musical selection and message. A little disco sounding (reminiscent of the Karen Carpenter solo effort which was also shelved until recently) - definitely more throaty, somber sounding for the most part. A Must for true Da-iddy fans. Favorite Cut: ""Dirty Work"" (Gibb Bros. tune). Neat that his early roots and song choices were always in tact; Timothy B. Schmidt - Rusty Young - Bobby Hart etc. More on other CD's later."
1,Missing the `Cherish' - David of the seventies.,"When you want to reexperience your David-feelings of the seventies, don't buy this cd. I was expecting songs from Cherish and Rock your baby. My old fashion records sound better then this new fashion cd. It's a pity, that's what it is."
1,Totally Disappointed,"This is a total ripoff CD - whoever produced it took old reject tracks from a late-80's album David made in England and tried to pass if off as something worthwhile. It's TERRIBLE! He was experimenting with his voice at that time and although the British album had SOME good songs, those on this thing were definite rejects! Don't bother with it!"
4,Great for Idiom chapter in a TESOL class,"As a former TESOL tutor I would recommend this book as the basis of teaching English idioms having to do with gestures. The book comes complete with exercises, discussion topics and final review. The book is organized very well into units pertaining to gestures of different body parts and would be appropriate for advanced students of English. Illustrations of the gestures in simple line drawings are included. This book was not very useful for my initial purpose which was as a reference regarding Body Language; however, for the purpose for which it was intended I would give it a ""Thumbs Up""."
2,Best of Laurindo Almeida & the Bossa Nova All Stars,"I am a classical guitarist and I love the music of Laurindo Almeida. I ordered this CD expecting to hear excellent Bossa Nova that would have the cool sounds of Jobim combined with the steady, wonderful rhythms of this genre. Instead, I have a CD of elevator music. The dominant instrument in this combo is an organ. Now, organs are not bad if played by a competent player, such as one hears in Perez Prado. But this organ reminded me more of what one hears at high mass. Save your money. Dr. Richard J. Beck"
2,unhappy in lebanon,i thought this would latin misic on a classical guitar. it is more of a production with a orchestra. not what i was lookinf for.
5,this game rules,"need for speed underground 2 is the best game of the 21st. the cars whip a*** and the way u can custurmize ur car is wicked.i luv drag and drift racing,the nos is amazing!no game beats this it is the best game ever!"
5,nfsu 2,"This game is the best racing game ive ever played. I like the carrer mode on this one than on need for speed underground because on this one yoy go around looking for races. I also like this on better because u can get realy cool stuff.List of cool stuff u can unlock in this game:1.Hydralics2.Spinners3.Sound systems4.Flip up doors5.mirrors6.Speedometers7.different trunks8.carbon fiber stuffand many moreI say a review and this kid that sayed street racing cars cant go over 120. Well if u go out and buy a acura rsx already its top speed is 140 and its stock too. Well that kid dont know a single thing about street racingI give this game 1,000/1,000"
3,Such A Bored game...,"YEAH2 I KNOE THE OTHER GAMER SAID THIZ GAME GREAT AND ALL THAT...BUT TO ME THIZ GAME SI BORED BECOZ THERES NO COP,NO SUN,AND THE MOST I HATE ABOUT THIZ IS...ITZ TOO EASY..."
1,Frustrating WASTE OF MONEY,This game held promise but had TONS of technical problems. It was incompatible with my Thrustmaster controller and now while the music will come up the visual is either incredibly slow or totally dark.I've tried it on my brand new Dell Laptop (which has had no problems with other software) and it still doesn't work. DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!!!!
1,bought it but waste of money,this game is boring!!! it was a total waste of money. races are dull. city too big. save your money and don't make the same mistake i did. read the gamespot review for the truth at: www.gamespot.com they gave an honest evalutation.i wish i would have listened but i'm just going to sell this game.
4,Fun Game!!!,I purchased this game as a gift for my nephew. He loves it.The service was excellent. Thank you Amazon!
4,NFSU2 Rules,"this is a great game I rented it and it was cool. You can drive Hummers, Navigators, Escalades, AudiTT'S, G35's and the new Mustang gt and the Pontiac GTO"
5,U SHOULD BUY THIS GAME,this game is da bomb. it is cool! It is way better than the first but it is still as challenging as NFSU(need For Speed Underground #1) It is so cool! U should buy it!!! It is worth every penny for the ppl who like racing games if u have the first game this 1 is better. Most of the stuff from NFSU2 are from the first game.I am the best at the first game beacuse i beat it five times in 4 months. Also there is alot more of stuff like spining rims and vertical door kits(scissor doors) and cool hood that do amazing things! BUY IT! IT IS WORTH IT!
1,released too quick!,This game seems to have have alot of glitches!the biggest ones are I have done this game three times finished the world map of races and have gone as far as possible three times without even being offered the last underground league races to win the wrx and the skyline and there are no more races period in search mode.It seems if you are going to release a games you at least need to hint as to what to do to finish it.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"overall this game is bad. the free roaming is a pain in the [...].the game is only fun if you are playing against a friend not against the cpu.sort of overpriced. would of been a good game if the price was $29.99 . i'm not happy with it but oh well, maybe others will be."
2,not what I expected,"after rushing out to buy this game the day after it came out, and then rushing home to play it, I was quite disappointed. I had sold the first version so i could get some extra change to buy this version. I must say, the graphics in this game are quite good, but otherwise, besides the free-roaming (which is a pain in the a**), this game is the same as the first one. Yes, the cars are different, but they run the same as in the first version. I recommend buying or keeping the first one, unless you are ecstatic about the free-roaming and the new addition of cars."
2,Don't waste your time,"I know how to play video games. I play them all the time, and I was not happy with this game. To me, it seemed like the computer would cheat. I could run a perfect race and lose in the last 20 seconds. I don't mind losing, but it constantly happens near the end. Another annoying factor to the game is RAIN, it rains basically EVERY race. Overall, not impressed."
5,Better than NFS Underground 1!,"This game far exceeded my expectations. I like how you can just drive around and challenge other cars to ""Tag"". I like how there's more options to customize your car, like new colors and accesories. But I don't like how the drift races are timed and how you actually race your opponents. Overall, it's a pretty cool game and it is better than the original, though nothing can beat it."
4,A big step foward in the racing genre,"First of all I do not own this game but I did rent it. And I have to say I was really impressed. Like Midnight Club 2 Need for speed now has a new explore mode where you can drive over hundreds of miles of terrain. In explore mode you can go to all kinds of shops each with their own types of upgrades. Such as Car Lots, Performance shops, car specialty shops, and car design shops. Upgrading your car is trully addictive, you can get anything from hydrolics, neon lights, speakers in your trunk, and even scissor doors. The racing is great and has great car control. The car physics are very realistic. The sound is very clear, and the music is alright. My biggest complaint is probably the load times, it feels like it takes for ever. That is the only complaint for me, although I don't think I'll buy the game."
2,good game though strickly for kids,this game is fun to play though its strickly for children age 5-12. if you are older you may have different tastes.
1,Need For Speed SUCKS!,THIS GAME HAS THE ILLEST CARS AND THE WORST GRAPHICS YOU COULD EVER SEE IN YOUR LIFE! This GAME IS FOR PEOPLE THAT JUST WANT TO LOOK AT CARS AND NOT PLAY THE GAME. THE GRAPHICS IN THIS GAME ARE MADD UGLY. ONLY GET THIS GAME FOR SHOWING OFF NOT BEING A REAL GAMER AND ACTUALLY PLAY IT!
1,THIS IS FOR GEEKS,"THIS GAME IS VERY BORING AND DULL. AND OF COURSE PEOPLE BUY IT BECAUSE THERE IS A FOOL BORN EVERY MINUTE. EA REALIZES THIS AND SELLS GAMES BASED ON THIS CONCEPT.ANYWAY, I PLAYED THIS AT A FRIENDS HOUSE AND IT STINKS. I'M WAITING FOR MIDNIGHT CLUB 3 TO COME OUT."
1,this game is disappointing,i just got this game as an early present. its not good. its not cool. listening to brooke burke sound cool is really lame. don't get it.
1,not as good as the the 1st one,this is not as good as the first nfsu. go and get the first one for only 20 dollars. don't spend the extra 30 dollars on this junk. or get the game manhunt instead. it will scare the crap out of you.
2,good game too dull,too much celebrity crap in this game. not enough good gameplay. if you want celebrities put someone like ron jeremy or lexington steele in the game to make it cool.
5,fun game,"I bought this for my 14 yo son.He has many games,this is his favorite,would recommend this game for boys who like motorsports."
3,Sizing,Not sure if this helps but I believe the sizing of the blazer is in European sizes which means that a 48r is like a 38r and a 50r is like a 40r in us sizes. In addition Prada fits pretty snugly so worth taking note....
5,Works Great with Axim51,"works great with my Axim51. Installed easily. I have been looking for something that was compatible. I was skeptical at first in trying this. I had tried a different type of wireless card and it hadn't worked at all. This one works great, so far no problems."
1,It doesn't work with Palm products,"For all of those looking for a wifi card for your Palm,DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!"
4,Spectec SDIO WiFi card...,"Pretty good in that it is small and therefore won't get snapped off (unlike the SANDisk card or similar).Shame it doesn't do LEAP authentication. It only does PEAP or SmartCard authentication. Still, it might come in future releases.It was delivered very quickly from Taiwan (!?@#~?!), but it came when it said it would, so I'm happy :)DM"
1,Is NOT compatible with Palm,"Amazon says it is, Spectec say's it's not. 'nuff said. The disc comes with PC Only drivers for the Windows Mobile versions mentioned, but nothing for Palm."
3,Nice card,"The card has a nice low profile when inserted. The driver software installed fine. I'm using it on an HP iPaq 6515. I needed third part software (Hitchhiker) to get my applications to recognize the card though. That was a little frustrating. I tried a lot of things before looking around for other software. Once I got that figured out the card got good reception from various wireless networks that I use regularly. I'm happy with it. The support and information available on the card is pretty much non-existent. I'm thankful that ""Hitchhiker"" solved all my problems. GOOD hardware, LOUSY software & support. I'll give it a 3 out of 5."
1,No tech support,was not able to get it working on a Garmin Que M5 and Spectec does not have US support. So not to happy:(
5,Works great with my Garmin iQue M3,"I've got a Garmin iQue M3 and this product works great! Good connectivity, small, and doesn't hog battery life. Thanks to everyone who suggested it!Jeff"
5,"Excellent, works fine with Orange SPV M1000","I got this card from the US. I live in the UK and use a Orange SPV M1000. As soon as I installed the driver, inserted this card, and started the sofware, it picked up wireless signal and I was online :). Great product, the price is also very yummy as compared to other similar products such as Sandisk etc..The OS in my device is Pocket PC 2003 Edition.Aviral Mittal."
2,Sorry - don't like the seller,"Nothing wrong with the product , problem was with the seller. When I found I didn't need this particular item, they would not let me return it. So I have an unused Wireless LAN Card, which I'm sure is a fine product, just not what I needed."
3,Works fine using the Pocket PC PPC) install,"I'm using a windows mobile 5.0 product and though the software came with an install specific to WM5 and initially the product did install, I could see it in the ""remove programs"" section of my handheld but I just couldn't find an icon to tap on. So I uninstalled the software and reinstalled with using the PPC2003 installation and it works just fine that way.The software installation guide so simplistic it was useless and I haven't found any website with fixes to address the above problem.WM5 recently came out with some firmware and I thought I'd try reinstalling the SDIO software after installing the firmware. It would tell me loaded the software for WM5 but I still didn't have an icon to tap on, nor was it found in ""remove programs."" Only the install for PPC2003 worked, but that seems to work great."
3,refreshing burst,This is to small for a guy like me i dont think it will last long.But for you smaller guys should do the trick.
4,sturdier than others,"this one is a good deal sturdier than other comparable priced units. It is very tight, and may tear easily if you don't use a good lubricant, and it is ribbed on the inside which makes it feel really nice. I recommend it if you're tired of the same old 'handshake'."
1,cheap,After using this a couple of times it did not hold up and split apart on me. There are better toys out there.
2,"Feel great, but it is not buit to last","I love this one, but it was torn apart after two or three times of using it. I might got the defective one; I don't know. It made in two sections, and the glue or whatever that holds it together just doesn't hold anymore__a piece of crap...LOL With that price you should try it."
3,Ripped during first use,"I got this as a gift for my husband. It ripped during the first use and plenty of lube was used, for the record. He said that it worked great. But, there is obviously a design flaw. He said that the entry hole needs to be larger (it is only the size around of a pencil which really is not even realistic). So $12 plus shipping for about 10 minutes of pleasure. It could go either way as to whether or not it was worth it."
2,Not so much...,"Does this work, yes. Are there things that work better, yes. Is this better than your hand... I don't think so. First it is small (I am not big by any means of the word). It gets really slippery on the outside if you aren't careful and that makes it hard to use. The material, in my opinion, also doesn't provide enough tension on its own and if it is slippery outside it is even hard to apply hand tension. I always worry about the small openings in many of these things but this one was no problem... It is soooo stretchy that it was easy in but that relates to the tension issue.My advice, get something better."
1,Not Adam & Eve product,"Product received did NOT have Adam & Eve anywhere on the packaging. After a quick search online the product is made by ""Topco Sales"" and is listed for $6.60 not $13.00 as Amazon claims. The quality of this product us very bad and very cheap. Save your money and spend it elsewhere..."
2,2-tone masturbator,"This thing has got to be made for men who are very small. I've never considered myself to be very large either. It's a jelly material and stretches quite a bit but I still tore it about an inch on the top and bottom of the hole on during my first use of it. Its also very short so expect to be popping out the back of it. Also it is very akward to hold because of the jelly material it's made from so you might want to wrap a cloth or something around it for grip. All in al, save up a few more bucks and buy something better..."
2,does the job but better ones out there.....,"It is just ok. I bought three different types of these from three different providers, and I found that this one does not even come close to [...] The Vajayjay from pure romance is a lot more money, but well worth the money. A lot closer feeling to reality than this adam and eve masturbator. But if your looking for something that just ""does the job"" and ""cheap"", then this will do."
1,SecondsFlat,"I got this CD by accident, and love it! It's kind of Country rock with a little Spanish mixed in. Excellent lyrics, melodies, and guitar work. Can't wait to hear more from these guys. Matt -Montrose, CO"
5,Sweet Streets City Gift Set,This was an amazing deal and my grandaughter loves this line of products. I hope to find more of these deals in the future with Amazon.
1,How dare they!!,How dare they charge what they are for this movie!!! I get that it is extremely rare footage of Nicole but over 100 dollars for a VHS???? I would love to own this but I'm not spending 400 dollars on a VHS!!!
5,Passing It On,I could not put this book down. I read it and am passing on to my grandmother......It helped ease my pain knowing how animals know death.
2,I was disappointed!,"I wouldn't recommend this book and after all the positive reviews and recommendations I have to say I was very disappointed with this book.I had expected more detailed info on the passing of animals form the animals point of view, instead I got a lengthy account on how the author felt and how she coped, etc., it was definetly more like a biography for her own person than a book about animals!!won't buy any other books from her again and will donate this book to the local library!"
5,Blessing the Bridge,"Blessing the Bridge not only explores what animals teach us about dying, it celebrates the life of many beings--from a spider who appreciates good music to a duck who teaches a powerful lesson in letting go. Sandwiched inbetween are tales of beloved dogs and other companion animals--each bears a gift the author accepts and shares with the readers of this book. Blessing the Bridge will fill your heart with joy and your brain with practical ways to cross that bridge when you come to it. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Simply Wonderful!!!!,"When deciding to buy this CD on amazon,I was a little hesitant since I could'nt sample the songs before buying,but thanks to the other reviews on the page I took my chances;and they were right the CD is GREAT!I love EVERY bangra beat on this CD.A good mix of male and female singers and beats,when you here it, you just can't help but DANCE.Both my children and I always dance around the house when the musics on.I have other bangra cd's but this one beats them all!!Wonderful!"
3,poor packaging,"Subtle flavors & very hard/brittle. Wish better packaging was available as these (~1/16"" thin) crackers came pretty pulverized. Each package had MAYBE 1-2 flats that were 1/2-3/4 whole, the rest were pieces. Enkoyed taste enough to get again or try other flavors. These are only sweetened with Apple Juice :)"
3,Not what i thought.,"The cover of this looks like another tale of gothic horror from Brain Damage Films. But, Gorno is much more like a Harmony Korrine white trash,kinda like KIDs meets Freaks and Geeks? serial killer tale,, really good punk music,,,Really good acting from the main young kid. Hey they left it wide open to,, Gorno 2 ? I'd buy it!!"
1,This is NOT the color version!,"Amazon is selling this as Episode 99 (the color version). It's not! It's Episode 1 (the black & white version). It's a good episode just make sure you're buying the right version, Episode 99."
5,spell-binding......won't stop reading before you finish it..,"I was 12 years old tomboy when I started to read Karl May books from school library in Indonesia. Once started, I never stop reading them until I finish. After I read the Winnetou book, I am so drawn to his character that I've dreamed to be Winnetou's girl friend! I was very sad and crying hard when he died. When I came to the US 11 years ago and meet my husband for the first time in my first 4 years, it was a dream come true. He is part Cheyenne and proud to be a Native American (though he's as blond as a white man)! I read all his books and looking forward to read them again. Is there anyway you compile all his book in one, but not necessarily shortening it? And I would be gladly to order them for me, my husband and my children."
1,Worst case of Mary Sueing ever,"I gave up. This book is the worse case of Mary Sueing I have ever seen, reads like some sort of horrible fan-fiction (please note that this is the good translation version).Your a pretty good shot; here have this great gun.This is the best horse I have ever seen but can't be broken; you broke it so you can have it.Wow you laid out that tough guy with one punch, and that other tough guy with one punch; Lets call you Shatterhand.Only a fool or the really experienced would take on a bull buffalo; It charged you but you took it out with one shot.If you encounter a grizzly, best thing you can do is run; wow you killed it with a knife.And on and on and on.... Not even a fourth of the way through and I can't stand anymore, tee hee."
5,Books from my childhood,"Winnetou was the first book I ever read.... I loved the series, I loved it so much that I read all the other books written by Karl May and bought them too. After first having read it, I was so upset with how the First Americans were treated that I decided to ""go to America when I grew up, become President and give them their freedom.""..."
4,An unique experience,"Be it as a trip down memory lane or as a powerful reading experience for the young, I recommend this book.I read it as a child, in an Spanish edition I just learned was abridged (!). I thought Karl May was an American author (!)In reviewing his works with grown-up eyes, I discover the the power of the characters remains the same. But I buy this book with mixed feelings.During years, this was the American West to me: brave men, noble men, greedy men, wild men of many colors. I never saw a western movie that pleased me like this, none of them were as real.I have read more careful, historic, ""true"" books since then, but inside my mind, despite facts, I find this remains the real American West to me. A land of many stories, with an exceptional guide behind."
3,Hero of Heroes,"Attempting to shed the label of greenhorn, Old Shatterhand pits his strength, sharpshooting skills, and wiley ways against all challengers, man or beast. At times the intricate descriptions and scenarios can become a bit tedious. Rest assured Shatterhand's aura will protect him as he strives to cultivate his friendship with the noble Winnetou. These noble heroes inhabit a realm not unlike the American west. It's a ride you cannot resist."
4,enjoyable,"As you know, this was Verdi's first opera. First performed in 1839 at Teatro alla Scala it was moderately successful and was revived a number of times during the next three years. Today there are few opportunities to see Oberto performed so one might ask whether it is a strong enough work to still entertain and whether this production does it justice. I would answer both questions with a resounding ""yes"". The singing is never less than adequate, the choral numbers being particularly rousing and the staging quite appropriate to the drama at hand. Oberto is a rather old fashioned opera where character after character takes center stage and stands and delivers. Numbers are frequently followed by well earned applause. A pleasant night at the opera."
3,Oberto in DVD,"It's, I think, thefirst Oberto in DVD, so it's very important. But all singers overact a little, and, what's worst, THEY HAVE CHANGED THE FINALE!!! In the orginal story - read the libretto - Leonora ends her days in a convent. Here, this genius called Ignazio Garcia, the stagediretor, makes Leonora nuts, with a sword in hand all the time (nobody of the chorus, who are watching, to stop her) anda finally, she kills herself!!! Poor Verdi.Verdi - Oberto"
2,Being Revised,This is an elementary book on Play of the Hand. Watson's Classic Book on Play of the Hand is much better. This book is part of the ACBL Beginner Series and has bidding reviews. The ACBL has finally realized that their bidding system in the Club Series and Diamond Series is outdated. The books are being rewritten. I would wait until the new edition is published and only buy this book as part of a class taught by an ACBL Certified instructor.
1,Poor example of photography,"This book is probably the poorest representation of photography that I have seen in a Nature Conservancy book. I would not even recommend this book to an amateur for prose or photography. A real sample of the thoughtless art of todays ""new world""."
4,French Workbook,"I really like how there are answers in the back to about half of the exercises. It helps you learn but you are not always just cheating when you get lazy. It is very appropriate for the class that I am in, French 203 (also called 201 at some schools)."
3,It's ok,My cat really likes it but what he liked more was when the cats showed playing more than squirrels or birds. He'd much rather watch other cats !!
3,not so much.....,"This had plenty of bird and other small animal sounds but not the movement......cats watched for a few minutes and then walked away.....I bought Episode 2 and they loved it.....one thing......watch it with them the first time, that way you know what to move from on top of your tv when they go looking for them....."
3,"Good, But Not Great","Though this is a good album, I do have a couple of complaints. Number 1, the album is way to short. If an album is less than 40 minutes, it just doesn't seem to be worth the money. This is a minor drawback though. My second complaint is that the dualdisc is flawed. The DVD side works fine, and because I have surround sound, it is worth it. However, the CD side is defective. The last song, ""Have You No Pride"", cuts off after 53 seconds as if it were misrecorded. I don't know if all the copies are this way, therefore I don't want to waste my time taking it back. By the other reviews I've read though, it sounds as if the single disc probably is the way to go. If anyone else does have a problem with the CD side, please post it on here."
3,"Good , but flawed....","I agree with the post from Ohio: This release is good, not great. This time around the Donnas has more variety, at the expense of the aggression. Most of the tunes are well written, but are too laid back and dont pack enough punch. This said, I believe the album is good enough to warrant a purchase but....what is up with track 11 on the dual disc? Mine cuts off at 53 seconds also! I exchanged my copy that I bought in NYC, and the second copy I got had the same problem! Looks like I will have to pick up the regualar version. (Too bad 'cuz the misic video IS really cool)"
5,It was perfect,I bought those twi mirror and it was perfect and they ship them too fast and i am happy and my car u also happy:)
3,Mirror glass replacement,"The transaction went w/out a hitch. I received the replacement glass in timeframe promised. The glass did do the job. It didn't have the best finish on it, it didn't fit exactly like the old but all in all for the money I'm statisfied with the purchase. Hope this helps someone considering using this vendor and this product."
3,Who's in Turin?,"Chamberlain does a good job of painting a picture of Nietzsche's harrowed yet sublime life. However, the work makes obvious the fact that she is NOT an expert in his philosophy. It is a decent, playful exploration of Nietzsche, but surely not a serious introduction to his thought or its internal evolution."
3,Meh,"I bought this book expecting a discussion of Nietzsche's day to day life in Turin in 1888 while writing three of his most important books. I wanted some insight into his actual life; stuff I couldn't get elsewhere. The first few dozen pages are like that, and they are very satisfying. Then, unfortunately, the book descends into a very long, very tedious discussion of Nietzsche's relationship with Wagner, his love of Wagner's music, and more half-baked theories about music's role as an existentialistically transcendent phenomenon than I could count. Really disappointing, although there are a few gems scattered throughout. It was a chore to get through, and I was expecting it, as I live and breathe Nietzsche, to be a delight."
2,An exercise in self-proselytising,"An entertaining book, written with passion. However, the passion is what the authoress feels for herself, Nietzsche is quite incidental...Poor scholarship, great self-advertising! Chamberlain should stick to her cooking books."
5,Exactly what I needed!,"This product is exactly what I needed to adapt my 3"" pellet stove pipe to my existing 6"" Selkirk chimney pipe. Worked perfectly."
5,Important Resource for MH Professional & Parent of Teens,"I am pleased that Glenn Goldberg, who is a highly-respected professional in the field of adolescent psychology, has finally produced this audio CD. In it, Mr. Goldberg reveals his creative approach to helping the parents of adolescents traverse this critical phase of development in their children; and emerge from this challenging stage stronger and wiser. I recommend this audio CD for any parent of teens or soon-to-be teens and for all mental health professionals who work with this population."
4,"a ""cup"" of good music","This is not like a lot of new age electronic CD. This is a clever mix of music for relax yourself, of course the result is a ""fruit salads"" ... but in 75 minuts you will find very few moments where you will be looking if it's still the same tracks!Exotic and etnich music (ALWAYS IN THE ELECTRONIC SOUNDS) with some picks like Seductor-Alkemx, or like Senor Sanchez -Bazille Noir. Belive me is not a CD only for your private massage, is a CD for your atmosphere at home or even in the car."
4,Finally someone understands...,"Anyone who claims to dislike this book is just jealous because they didn't find it until after their future mother in law had talked them into silk flowers and a dress with poofy sleeves the size of their head.If you've ever planned your own wedding you know how pushy and opinionated even the least involved people can be. This book encourages brides to actually stand up for themselves and plan a wedding they won't have to look back on and cringe.My only suggestion is to the publishers to PLEASE get a new cover. I almost didn't pick the book upon seeing it. It looks like the cover for ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" and what's with the dog?"
3,Not for information seekers,"This book might be a nice diversional book for the bride and groom who have months to plan and want to read interesting stories about some weddings. But it did not have very much useful information in my opinion. So if you have a limited budget for wedding books, and limited time to read them, and are needing answers on how to plan your wedding - I would skip this one."
3,For Very Young Brides Only,"I was an ""older"" second-time bride, and while I didn't relate to much of this book when I bought it, I think it would have been helpful the first time around, when I was in my early 20s. Brides who are already grown up and have a sense of themselves won't need this book, but those very young brides who need to assert their independence may find it helpful."
1,Gross me out!,"If you need hints on how to be blatently rude in the name of ""my day"" to those most dear to you, this is your book. It contains no ideas for gowns, flowers, cakes, or other ways to personalize a wedding. It seems to exist only as an excuse to legitimize bad bridal behavior. My copy is now in the trash."
2,Very simplistic book.,"The book is at a level of a magazine article overview, just longer. With some editing it probably could have made it into a magazine."
3,Useful only for a reference book,"We are all well aware that it is impossible to write a book on bioinformatics satisfying all types of readers. That is the reason why we are spending much time on finding a book that we can say ""This book is just for me!""Well, this book is not a self-teaching book by itself. Don't expect that things will become clear to understand after reading this book.If your expectation is just to taste flavor of bioinformatics and to use it as a reference book, then this book is right for you."
2,Very bad title,"It is a cardinal sin to tack an inaccurate title to a piece scientific writing, but that's what happened here. The title ""Bioinformatics Computer Skills"" seems to imply that the book will teach *skills.* It would be better titled ""Bioinformatics Computer Resources,"" and it does a pretty good job of trying to describe the areas where IT and biology overlap, although that is a vast undertaking for a slim book. And this book does not replace any standard reference in either field.For the programmer, this book will steer them towards major resources for bioinformatics. For the biologist, there are thumbnail descriptions of important programming tools, minus the IT handwaving argle-bargle.But in no sense does it build ""skills."" There's not enough biology here to benefit a programmer, and there's not enough IT to benefit a biologist. This book will not prepare either a biolist or programmer to do even simple tasks."
5,Excellent SE text and reference,"I have just completed the JHU program in Systems Engineering. This book is the foundation for the curriculum and is a very readable, solid overview of Systems Engineering. All phases of the system life-cycle are introduced and tied together to truly illustrate the process. The book focuses on processes, the tools used will change, but good Systems Engineering will stay the same. The process to derive good requirements that are able to be implemented and tested are the same regardless of technology or field."
5,Excellent resource!,This book is a great text for those interested in learning or expanding your knowledge of systems engineering. Well presented with sound explanations on the concepts. My company has multiple copies in use. Highly recommended.
5,Regularly Used Reference,Useful in many of my process definition tasks. Essential text for any System Engineer.
1,Terrible Book,"Worse book I have ever read. When engineers write books this is what you get, a ton of definitions and poorly structured uninteresting chapters. Learned more from reading online, then I ever got from this book. I don't even think it is worth the paper it is written on. Absolutely terrible, don't buy."
3,My fish don't care for this product,I have a 125 full of Cichlids and they show very little interest in these sticks. I have put them in whole and broke them up into smaller pieces and still no reaction. My fish like the pellet food or flakes. I usually end up getting the net and scooping the sticks back out. Can't say anything about quality just that my Cichlids do not like them.
2,Small and fragile,"I bought this item brand new and in hot pink colored (caught my eye). Flashy, small & cool looking! However, it contains 1 LED light which is bright but not wide spread. So when reading it lights up only the center of the page. You will have to constantly reposition it to keep from straining your eyes. The constant bending and reposition will affect the fragile wiring on this thing. About 10-15 uses after buying this product, I noticed a flikering (very annoying). It slowly worsens the more I used it. In fact, I put the thing away and haven't used it again b/c of the annoyance. Thank goodness I didn't pay much for it. Value for the money is about a ""7"" because you get what you pay for. Spend the money and try something else with more than 1 LED in it. My next bet is finding something with a real light bulb in it or maybe I will just annoy my husband at bed time and read with the lights on :)"
2,Okay while it lasted,"I bought one of these from a regular retail store. It was the second cheapest one. Now, about a month later, the light has dimmed to basically nothing. I felt that the flexible wire was not strong enough either; it would not stay exactly where I directed it. It was okay while it lasted, but this time I'll spend more for one of better quality."
3,"3 Stars, It's OK","I found the book very repetitious. He kept going back over and over about what people did and thought back in the 1800's Once was enough. He is obviously pro cremation and is more than antagonistic towards Christianity I think and how they relate/think about the subject. People feel the way they feel and they aren't necessarily ignorant or brainwashed by religion because of it. He wants to promote the liberal side of religion and how sensible they are and on and on. He really does go on and on about the same thing. The book could have been much shorter.By the way, I attended a symposium at Forest Lawn in 2003 where Prothero was a speaker along with others. At the end, questions were directed to the speakers. And someone asked Prothero whether he had children or not to which he answered yes, and it was a child of just a few years. The person asked him that if his child died, would he cremate them. It stumbled Prothero who finally answered that he would NOT."
4,Takes some effort,"This book is harder to follow than its website suggests. I had to reread some parts to understand, and the most profound insights didn't occur to me until days later. But the author does a good job deconstructing such an abstract subject as sleep. Some insights blew me away. There is little Buddhist history or theory here so if you want a comprehensive introduction to Zen there are better choices. But if you are merely curious about Zen, or already familiar with it, and have trouble sleeping then this is your book. Well written with intriguing illustrations."
2,ok game but all the players are one dimensional,this game is ok.the great thing about it is all the old school players you can choose.problem is ivan lendl will play the same way say a john mcenroe will play.and we all know those are two totally dfferent players.but not on this game.all the players hit from the baseline.and its easy to figure all of them out.they do return alot of balls but there is no strategy involved and its easy to figure out how to beat them just by coming in and volleying.they dont do this against you and i wish they did.it becomes boring quick.if you are looking for a good tennis game i recomment smashcourt tennis 2.best tennis game to date.
2,Not worth it,"I was not impressed by the quality of this item. Most of the vidoes seems of low quality. Interesting info but but looks like stuff I could have gotten off the internet for free. Plus, the information was useless for my high school students"
1,NOT worth your time or money,A very bad old documentary. i wish I could give it zero.it is more propaganda than a real documentary.dont waste your time.
5,Gillian Cross At Her Best,"This is Gillian Cross at her best. A wonderful and engaging adventure involving a girl, her elephant, an orphan boy and the man who wants to take the elephant from them. Crossing 2000 miles of 19th century America, this is a grand chase well described.The book won Whitbread and Smarties awards. The latter involved children voting on the short listed books, so it is clearly a children's favourite. Gillian Cross is a tremendously versatile author, who has written many books that I have liked very much in a variety of very different settings. This one is very much recommended."
4,Makes you want to check the closets and leave the light on at night,"Is there a genre called fantasy/horror? If not, it should be invented just for ""innocents Aboard."" This book is like that nightmare we all have about falling. The stories start off with innocent, even mundane narrative and then suddenly the floor drops away. For example, 'The Monday Man' starts off as a cop and a lawyer having a drink and talking about hunting and fishing. The cop tells about his encounter with a Monday Man, a guy who would steal laundry from clotheslines when it was hung out to dry on Mondays. But what begins as a foot chase starts takes a sharp turn into the 'twilight zone. Another feature is that Wolfe never tells the whole story. He always leaves enough blanks and question marks that you want to know more. These are the type of stories that make me want to check the closets and leave the light on before turning in for the night."
4,ELL,"OK. Easy to read, nicely organized but I learned the same things in one day seminars that are cheaper than the book. Was not worth it to me."
5,Pleased,"I was very pleased with my the book that I purchased from Amazon. It was almost brand new, and it arrived promptly."
2,Not so solid oak,There are parts of the cabinet that are not solid oak. The sides are some sort of compressed board covered in oak laminate. Some of this was loose on the unit I bought. It works well but I thought it a little over priced.
4,great deal,"I purchased this particular model of ironing board because the door could be hinged on either side.(Most of the others I saw had the door hinged on the right) Many models were way too expensive for this option,and I think this is reasonably priced. The door is real wood (not particle board) and board pivots when opened. (nice if someone needs to get by) I had someone put it up for me, so I cannot attest to ease of mounting, but I am thrilled with the result. (he was smart enough to ask how high...important to check with board extended, as there is no way to adjust) Love the quick access. Didn't need iron storage, had a plug near...am completely satisfied and would recommend."
1,Terrible Construction-All Fiber Board,I have this ironing board cabinet and it is less than 2 years old. The screws on the hinge for the door have pulled out of the fiber board and so have the two screws holding the ironing board intact. Didnt even last 2 years.
5,Daughter loves it!,"I bought this for my 3yr old daughter. She absolutely loves it! Comes with a LOT of people and quite a few pieces. She loves the lifeguard and pool area. The house opens up and is real cute! The baby is pretty small, so probably not good for kids that still put things in their mouth. Such a great price and so worth the money!"
4,An interesting read,"This is a strange, quirky book by an incredibly talented author. The characters are wonderful, the most alive and unpredictable ones I've read in a long time. The structure of the book isn't traditional or intentionally satisfying, which is refreshing and frustrating at the same time. In all, though, it's quite an experience if just for the way she can turn a sentence."
2,"Great writer, OK book","I loved the creativity, humor, and intelligence that Lucy Ellmann brought to her task as writer of this book; I just wish the story she told was different, especially toward the end. The first part of the book intrigued and entertained me, but gradually I became restless and even bored. Didn't like the ending. While sections were examples of brilliant writing, others seemed to have escaped an editor's notice. I wished some parts were expanded and others narrowed or even deleted. Book left me on such a bummer that I wished I'd gone through and read only the ingenious, funny parts rather than the depressing stuff in between. Maybe I'm just not cut out for British humor, though...."
4,isn't she a bit like you and me?,Eloise is a depressed character that acts upon the whims that most people feel at some point or another in their lives- leave society and just give up on love. Her redemption and the story of her hermitude make for an interesting read.
3,A Thinker,"Man or Mango was one of those books that makes you think. You have to think to keep up with the story. You have to think to remember what was happening to the characters last. And, you have to think to figure out the point at the end. An interesting tale of a sad woman and the turns in life that bring her to an interesting new place."
5,Good Holocaust movie,I saw this movie when it first came out in 1981 or so and it tore my heart out. It still did. Very tough times and very tough decisions to be made by those involved. Based on fact.
4,The Wall,This was a good dvd. Especially like the closed captioning as we are hard of hearing. How can we know if a dvd is closed captioned. I received one or two that were not closed captioned (The Execution and israel making of the state.
2,Boring,"This movie was very boring and I don't feel it acurately captured the Warsaw uprising. A much better movie to view would be ""Uprising"" starring Leelee Sobieski, among others."
2,bad set of dvd? bad luck ?,"I had to return them. When I tried to play them in my DVD player that ussually plays any kid of DVD, in many portion of the play, it stop in al three DVDs. I was able to play however the Nutcracker in my computer. I am not a ballet nut but if I compare the quality of dancing of this ballet group vs the Bolchoi that I had already, the Bolchoi, which is 10 dollars is superior!. I have a 3 year old and she definetly enjoy more the Bolchoi ballet more than this one. Obviously, the bolchoi is simpler in decoration but superior in choreography and dance."
3,"Same formula, with a twist","Yes it is the same formula as in the other 4 air bud movies.But lets face it when you have a 3 year old who only wants to watch a movie with a ""doggie"" that looks just like hers, it's nice to have 5 different movies to choose from. I ""watch"" air bud 7 days a week 1 or 2 movies per day with my daughter, variety helps. It is definitely not for adults or kids over 9, who will think it too lame, but little ones will love it."
4,Air Bud: spikes back (v. good!!),"Right, i was scrolling through my sky, when i saw this movie, and when i first saw it, i thought it was going to be a kiddy movie. But, i was bored so i watched it and by the end...I LOVED IT!!! I think it has a good story line and that it is funny, exciting, and even touching at times. I would recommend this if you have a family, basically because kids WILL watch it over and over again. And you will get your moneys worth."
1,Another bad volleyball movie,"Most of the movie is about a teenage girl losing her best neighborhood friend and then making new friends at the local beach teen volleyball league. The rest of the movie is purely utopian. A little boy (no older than 6?) with his dog running unsupervised and unleashed all over the city, somehow able to make the trip to buy ice cream anytime they wish. They also dominate the local agility course scene. Gabby Reese is on the screen for about one minute at the very end. Don't let your curousity get the best of you, skip this one. It's as forgetable as any backyard game you've had to endure to make your friends happy."
1,Horrible!,Horrible! Sucked! Hated it! Put the Air Bud movies to rest. Disney is losing they're touch with Air Bud movies. End it and move on! Don't make people suffer anymore!
3,Frightening and preaching,"True, this book isn't high fiction, but the story it tells is chilling. In a time of concern about WMD, this book shows perhaps who is really behind biological weapons research. Other than the writing style (which is mawkish and strained), the only real down point of the book is the concept that America's stature in the world has declined primarly due to drugs. When the drug pipelines of the world are wiped out, America bounces back from the edge of destruction, according to Goliszek. Of course, the problem could more easily be solved by legalization, but as a person employed in the field of public health, it would be against engrained dogma for the author to admit such. Still, a scary look at the illegalites our government seems to relish in dealing in."
2,GOOD IDEA - POOR EXECUTION,"By the first 100 pages you know how it's going to finish but it's still interesting, then the characters become predictable and the writing is like a screenplay for the X Files. Too many holes in the plot for anyone who likes realism in their stories"
2,Terrible writing spoils a promising idea,"I cannot stress how poorly written this book is. Given the (apparently true) material that the author had to work with, it is difficult to conceive of a worse plot written with less skill. The paper-thin characters walk through their assigned parts like automata, behaving in unbelievable ways simply in order to fulfill the requirements of the story.If you like conspiracy theories, particularly those based on essentially factual information, then you may like this book, but be prepared to wade through it painfully rather than enjoying the experience."
2,"Intriguing premise, but so poorly written","The scientific underpinnings of this thriller are intriguing, especially in light of the documents published as an afterword. But the writing is amateurish and so wooden that it gets in the way of the story. In the hands of a better writer (or editor) this would be truly powerful."
1,A Waste of Your Time!,"Grammer school literary talent cannot conceal this book is only a vehicle for disseminating the author's anti-government conspiracy theories. Now in paperback, it should be racked with the supermarket tabloids. There are better ways to waste your money."
4,Trial Strengthens Faith,"""Throw a Christian into a river, and he will come up with a fish in his mouth."" So begins Pastor Wurmbrand's If Prison Walls Could Speak. The central thesis of this book is that trial strengthens faith, builds character, and gives way to hope. These sermons were written by Wurmbrand during his imprisonment in Communist Romania, which persecuted the Christian Church and sentenced Wurmbrand to three years of solitary confinement and later to twenty five years of further imprisonment for his continued leadership of the underground church. These years of persecution did not break Wurmbrand; rather, they yielded strength, faith, and hope, and would ultimately lead Wurmbrand to found the organization Jesus To The Communist World, which later became The Voice of the Martyrs, which aids persecuted Christians throughout the world."
5,Keep on DANCING!!!,This is one of the greatest disco collections I have ever heard featuring so many of my favorite classic dance hits mixed just the way they did back in the day. I recommend this collection to all the disco fans out there.
3,very good tennis game,"contrary to what that other reviewer said this is really a good game.the only problem i found with it is the screen.it only shows the players playing from the tennis ground level,you can't play over the top view like in most tennis games.but the game play is great.the best feature on this game is you can serve and volley really great."
2,Amazing Tennis?,WHAT IS SO AMAZING ABOUT THIS GAME? TO ME THIS GAME IS BORING AND A GOOD GAME TO PLAY WHEN YOU CAN'T SLEEP. HAVE A SLEEPING PROBLEM GET THIS VIDEO GAME FOR SEGA. WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD GET IS A PLAYSTATION VIDEO GAME FOR TENNIS OR WHAT FOR GAMECUBE TO COME OPUT IN NOVEMBER TO GET IT. ANYWAY DON'T BY THIS VIDEO GAME BELIVE ME YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS AND WILL PRBAOBLY SAY I WISH I WOULD SAVE MY MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING MORE DECINT THEN THIS GAME. EVEN SUPER NINTENDO IS BETTER THAN THIS VIDEO GAME.
4,Continuing the story,"Season two as a single box set would have been preferable. Parents should watch to decide if it's suitable for pre-teens or young teens, it's not really very bad, but opinions can vary on some of the ideas and situations in this one. It continues the original storyline yet somehow feels a little different at times. Still a good series, and they begin foreshadowing the conflict between KenIchi and Odin. Some of the story gets a little predictable, but that's not always a bad thing. If you liked season one, you should like this as well."
3,above average anime just fell a lil short on this disc :) !!,if your into fighting a must see prob the season 2 part 1 the weakest out the whole series and more into character development esp. getting the first fist to show his face but still sum good points the fight with hermit not bad Lo key or whatever his name is ruins the anime in my opinion any one disagree tell me why lol still a good anime good points still made even on this disc still the exciting factor not as good as the other discs worth 30 dollars not by a longshot 20 dollars yea but maybe im being nice :) :)
4,an important contribution to the literature,"I am familiar with this author's work, and appreciate her detailed bibliography. Researchers of Latin American women artists will find this tool indispensable."
5,Excellent Resource for Nondetects,"This book provides an important bridge between the issue of non-detects commonly encountered in environmental data and survival analysis techniques. As a statistician working for an environmental firm I was frustrated with the lack of resources available in properly dealing with non-detects. EPA guidances provide some insight, but each of the methods fail only apply under special circumstances. Helsel has presented several options in dealing with non-detect data as well as the inadequacies and benefits of each method. My only complaint is that the effect of small sample sizes could be more comprehensively addressed. It would also be nice if some of the methods were demonstrated in R as well as in Minitab. Alas, we cannot have all that we want."
3,Good greenhouse for warm weather,"This product has good sides and bad sides to it. The good side is it is a portable small greenhouse, which is not that expensive. It basically has the durability and usability of a large tent, and sets up pretty close to the same. It looks good on the patio and can be used for large and small potted plants.The down side - The clear plastic does not handle cold weather at all. It splits and cracks very easily when the temps get down into the 30s. Definitely something for spring only, and would not be good for year-round use, even in a protected area. (We kept it in a sheltered corner of our porch, protected by two sides of the house.)So if you are looking for just a seasonal greenhouse to unpack in the spring and use for growing seedlings outside, I would recommend this product. If you are wanting something more durable to protect plants during more seasonal weather conditions, you might just want to go ahead and spring for the actual permanent greenhouse."
1,Beware,"I purchased one and have been using it for 8 day now. Been going in and out many times per day, Not good, the plastic is riping out from the zipper. So far mine has 2 4 or 5 inch places where the plastic has pulled away. I would not recomed this product at all."
2,Difficult to close and open.,"Door is very difficult to open and especially close. It is as if the front panel is somehow out of whack. Also, this product came with NO instructions what so ever. NONE!"
4,Springhouse will meet needs,I was surprised that this is really more like a clear tent than a house of substance. There appear to be quality control issues - I am waiting on some new poles from Flower House. I would say overall I am pleased. I wish it were made a little better but I have confidence in it to last through the winter. I do not know if it can make more than one year.
1,Poor Quality,I do not like the quality of the Greenhouse. Plastic sides are very cheap. I have no clue why other people love it so much!!!
2,Lame excuses for flowers,"This book was written by someone who expected its readers to be morons who knew nothing about origami. Some of the patterns don't even look like flowers, and the ones that look nice mostly require cheating - cutting with scissors or using glue. There is also a huge lack in variety of leaf and calyx patterns. Don't waste your time with these two little pamphlets."
3,Who follows Ayn Rand,"Ayn Rand has been correct about a lot of the things but nevertheless, I cannot deny the fact that her writing incites the word 'I' in me. 'Reconsidering Ayn Rand' tries describing the impact of Ayn Rand text on oneself through writers eyes. This book then uses Christianity as backbone for refuting Ayn Rand, which one may argue is fundamentalist, but one must not forget that Bible itself would have been a book like Ayn Rand when first written. (Please note I am not Christian and neither have read Bible)The people who have liked Ayn Rand are the ones who are very honest workers, who want to be creators, but are pissed off because of the unreasonable people who have always hindered the absolute working of a system. This book tries to get hold of the fact that skill cannot make you a creator but a conjunction of vision(does not change) and skill(improves) is what gives you the right direction."
3,OK,"I can't add much to Scott Ryan's excellent (as usual) review. However, while I think this book would be beneficial for Objectivists to read, it doesn't go beyond John Robbins' books on Rand. It does have a good discussion of various problems in Rand's ethical theories. In addition, it does a good job in showing how Rand misunderstood Christianity."
5,What great fun!,These are hilarious DVD's that teach God's lessons to boot! My son loves watching all the penguin videos so we are glad to add these to our collection. If you want to watch a DVD with you child and find yourself laughing at some of the jokes then these are the DVD's for you!
3,It's not by Stephen King!,"Ok, when I stumbled across this one doing a search of obscure Stephen King titles, I thought ""Hey, never heard of that one; I'll order it."" Well, the introduction is by King, the contents (macabre poetry) are by Froehlich. This is a little pamphlet/brochure-type publication of about 50 pages. The poetry isn't horrible as far as poetry goes, although I have to disagree with the critics in that I would not dub Froehlich the foremost horror poet of this century. I rate this a 3 for two reasons: 1) the following poem ""BLOOD AT THE CIRCUS: And she caught my eye.....Luckily she threw it back. But I don't Know why."" Hey, it rhymes so it's gotta be poetry. And 2) the illustrations by Rodger Gerberding are interesting. Again, the poetry isn't horrible. If you have to order this, make sure you order it along with other selections so that you're not paying shipping and handling for this little pamphlet!"
4,Small Humidor Humidifiers,"I liked these, but they were handled rough in the mail and one was broken. They seemed fragile to me. I sometimes don't have time to go back to the supplier to report a broken item. They worked great, but when I went back to order more, they were temporarily not available. I recommend them for travel humidors or very small humidors."
3,Good introduction to knitting in Australia,"This book is a light, personal account of a novice knitter's introduction to the craft in Australia. The author visits knitting groups, wool mills, yarn shops and classes, and offers some insight into the PR motives behind the Australian knitting boom. The patterns at the back of the book weren't very useful, but apart from that it was an enjoyable read."
1,"Mateos,dedicate a otra cosa","Miguel Mateos fue siempre alguien que no supo definirse entre un carilindo comercial y un rocker de verdad. Y al final no fue ni una cosa ni otra y jamas resulto creible.El disco es malo como todo lo que hizo este muchacho.Quien dijo que es el mejor artista latino, jamas escucho a Silvio Rodriguez, Gabriel O Pensador, Lulu Santos o Gustavo Cerati....por nombrar algunos buenos musicos de verdad..."
2,Didn't Really See the Results,"I also purchased this based on the rave reviews, but I did not personally receive the great results. This lotion did not hurt my skin, but I did not see any changes or improvement. I have had better luck with other brands of alpha hydroxy products."
3,nothing dramatic,"I purchased this skin cream based on the rave reviews it received. However, I did not have a similar experience. I would say it mildly improved my skin, nothing dramatic. It just seemed to make my skin a little smoother. No improvement on my wrinkles at all. I have used it several times and sometimes there is a slight stinging sensation, but it's very mild. I wish I had had the same results as the other users, but sadly I did not."
4,GOOD !!! ;P ;),"GOOD GAME FUN , INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING !!!! LOTS OF FUN AND GOOD FEATURES !!!!!!!!!! PLENTY TO DO AND KEEP YOU BUSY FOR A WHILE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;) ;P"
5,Great program,"This is a great program. I have a son with high functioning autism and this was the only program that helped him. But the alot of these people are asking way too much for these books. Some people on here and ebay are asking more than the company even charges for brand new one. Not to mention math u see the website has free worksheet makers to help- you. I love amazon but if you are selling these or buying these bring the prices down or people are getting ripped off. These books are combed binding and as of April 2009 math u see is phasing them out for bard back edition with alot more worksheets that are double sided. They are also more detailed. These older editions are fine, work great what I have used this far, but the website has them on clearance some you can get 20$ and some sets 35$. Great program but dont pay too much."
3,"Good product, poor shipping packaging","The material was as described, but was poorly packaged when shipping. My product arrived open and damaged. I contacted the seller for a partial refund, but got no response."
3,Okay for multiplication..3rd grader,"I homeschool my 3rd grader who cries when it comes to math time. We were using Saxon 3 before this. So I thought with all the great reviews we would try this. Well she still cries as soon as she does not get it. She does not even really want to use the blocks and would rather figure it out in her head.I do think he goes rather fast when teaching it and you have to pause it a lot. I would say it is okay, but not up our ally really. I still have not found the perfect math program."
4,The best out there so far.,"This book is simply amazing considering what its competition is. Get this: all of the source code COMPILES, every single example!The first 4 or 5 chapters are a waste. They cover things like ""how to write stories"" and basic C++ concepts. These subjects should be in their own book, plus it would take 150+ pages off the size of this monster.The marketing hype on this book holds true, you can make a full ""game"" with this one! You still need to put the effort into turning it into a real one, but it's a very good start.I give it 4 stars because the author's programs all run in a window instead of full-screen. The book should also be around 200 pages shorter."
1,Extremely Confusing!,"I worked through ""Beginning C++ Game Programming"" by Michael Dawson and that book was fantastic.However, this book is very vague, and not very helful at all. Unless you already know DirectX very well, don't bother with this book. It's extremely confusing and doesn't explain anything, it just gives pieces of code that don't always work. It's a complete waste if you're anything below an intermediate to advanced level. I'm very angry because this book cost me $50 at the bookstore and I probably won't use it. DONT BUY THIS BOOK."
2,Not what it claims to be,"I wanted to give this book just 1-star, but I went with 2 on the basis of the facts that a) it is most likely a good source of information for more experienced programmers, and b) I didn't get far enough into the book to rate it in its entirety.First off, as others have mentioned, ""beginning to intermediate"" level programmers need not waste their time with this book. As a matter of fact, if you don't have any exposure to DirectX in the first place, this book will be confusing and nearly worthless. It serves more as a higher-level discussion on how various pieces of a game should be designed than it does an educational tool.While the book does have its merits, it was clear that the author was not able to relate to the beginning to intermediate level game programmer very effectively at all. I found it to be money wasted in that regard."
1,From the first sentence,"The very first sentence is ""In the sate [sic] of West Virginia, it's against the law to sneeze on a train."" It might make a good gag gift for an English major, but I don't recommend reading it; the whole book is filled with typos and short, dry descriptions. If you like weird laws, there are much better books that at least have funny commentary."
3,Great....while it lasts....,"I bought this cot about a year ago for my Bullmastiff. She LOVES it, but she's one of those dogs who has to scratch and cirlce before they go to sleep. Needless to say, she finally tore completely through the cover about a month ago. And, to top things off, the company apparently doesn't sell replacement covers like coolaroo does. I'm disappointed. I would have bought a replacement cover since the frame is still in good shape and usable. Now I will have to buy a complete bed. This time I wil go with Coolaroo, since I can get replacement covers!"
5,Great Bed For A Deck!,"We bought this XL bed for our two pointers to share on the back deck of our house. They love it. If it is a bit cold but sunny we put a couple of fleecy mats on it, in warm weather they just sleep on the canvas. They are so much more comfortable than they were with just the mats on the wood deck. Although you can leave it out in the rain we bring it in just to keep it nicer. It is so lightweight it is easy to carrry. We are all (people and dogs) very happy with this bed!"
2,Not good for Great Danes,"I have 2 great danes, each of which weigh 135-145 pounds. The description says it is rated for up to 200 pounds, but I guess my dogs were too rough on them because the first one didn't even make it 24 hours and the second one was destroyed the next day. Maybe their short and dull claws combined with their weight was too much for the cots, because the canvas covers ripped right down the middle. Also, I have not been able to find anywhere to buy replacement covers, which I considered doing and adding some extra padding on top to protect the canvas. But, right now I am stuck with $100 worth of metal frames."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Within ten minutes, the seams gave out. It's cheap and a total pain to put together. This might be a good bed for any dog under 60 lbs. It just feels extremely cheap, especially for the amount you pay for it."
4,Better than I remember....,"This is a great recording, a nice mix of soul, r&b;, and some fun rockers.Sound quality is good, nice and punchy, better than the live disc releasedalong with this. Both are highly recommended, good songs and good playin."
2,"Disappointing Holmes novella, but...","Val Andrews, a magician and photographer who has turned to writing has written a number of Holmes pastiches. This is the first I've read, and while disappointed, I'll give his work another try. This story finds Holmes pulling out of a depression and becoming involved in a long dormant murder of a young woman at a seaside resort, by way of his old acquaintance Irene Adler. Andrews hits on all the Holmesian cliches (Holmes' disguises fooling Watson, the arrogant local policeman, etc.) but doesn't fool the reader as Doyle so cleverly did with the mystery elements. As someone skilled in slight of hand in real life, perhaps Andrews will grow more skilled at making us look at the wrong suspect more convincingly in his next works. A good editor might help this writer to perfect Watson's unique narrative voice which here sounds right only part of the time. A pleasant read for an uncritical Holmes fan."
2,the torment of sherlock holmes,"This was a fairly improbable book with a few spelling errors and many grammatical problems, like many of Val Andrew's books. The premise was unlikely - Irene Adler becomes involved with trying to ameliorate Sherlock Holmes' depression. After all this negativity, I must say that I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't buy it if you need high-quality editing, but it is, after all, a Sherlock Holmes book, and as such, a good sketch of Dr. Watson's and Sherlock Holmes' relationship."
3,Passable Holmesian Pastiche,"Something a bit different from Val Andrews this time around: Holmes has had a nervous breakdown and is in a catatonic state. How to snap him out of it? Mycroft, Watson and a glamourous figure from Holmes' past join forces to re-awaken Holmes' interest in ""mean streets"" with unexpected results. Several Holmes pastiches (and an old play by William Gillette, which became the basis for the first Basil Rathbone Holmes film) have used the notion of planting fake clues to lead Holmes astray. Here, Andrews works not one, not two, but three twists on this concept, as the clues are supposed to bring Holmes back to himself, and... could it be they're not fake after all?If you have liked previous Holmes books by Andrews, you'll enjoy this one too."
5,This is a great rack for the money.,"This rack wont let you down. It's very sturdy, and well constructed. I cant wait to get more dumbbells so I can get the optional third tier."
3,"Item is solid but not ""new""","I've purchased a lot of items from Amazon and will continue to do so in the future, but the condition of this rack when it arrived is not acceptable. It has been out of the box prior to it being shipped and was either a floor model or a return. There are many scratches on both uprights (down to bare metal) and the sticker for ""Body Solid"" is peeling away. Overall it's a solid rack and if it weren't going right into the weight room where it will get scratched anyway I would return it."
4,Quality goofiness,"Authors sometimes say that their characters take on lives of their own. I know the experience of getting lost in a book - I imagine that happens to authors too.Now make the two literally true and put them together: the character come to life and the living person turned into fiction. Starting there, Holt does a good job of keeping the reader amused. The book reminds me of some older comedies, the ones with in-one-door-and-out-the-other chase scenes. It's like that, but with lots more people and doors that connect whole worlds.Good silly fun - I enjoyed this one a lot."
1,What???,"I own a good number of BMG-Classic sacd, and I love what their engineers did to these old RCA recordings, so I was looking forward to listen to this gem. Now, today I finally got to play it only to find out that, instead of Tchaikovsky, the disc contains something called ""Rite Time"" by some band called ""Can"" -a kind of reggae. Not quite Tchaikovsky, at least for my tastes. Please note that the disc itself (not only the box) is labeled as Tchaikovsky's. Well... I only hope Sony people (they bought BMG) are decent enough and agree to send me a well-recorded disc in replace."
2,No Tragedy in this version,"In my opinion, it was no tragedy that this recording has been ""overlooked"" for re-issue for so many years. The name of the work is one of the most descriptive ever given any piece in the history of western music. The emotions expressed in the ""Pathetique"" symphony are raw and tormented. No one could deny that Tchaikovsky must have been a soul in anguish to have penned this music. But this lifeless performance more than takes the edge off the experience, it removes the spirit entirely. Monteux, I can only assume, has no feeling for this music. I can only say that it is a waste of a brilliant orchestra to perform this work in this spiritless way and a waste of recording resources to have preserved the performance when there are so many excellent performances on disc."
5,excelente obra y gran dirección.,"gran sinfonía, brillante dirección y una mención especial para los ingenieros de sonido. altamente recomendable."
1,A Waste of Money,"Ever feel like you've been cheated? Anyone that knows anything about graphic design and thumbs through this book will instantly realize they have been duped by the title. ""The New Generation in Graphic Design"" would have been an appropriate title if this book had been published in 1985. With it's emphasis on ""Grunge Design"" and lop-sided with designers from Seattle (and the authors own mediocre work) this book hardly represents anything new but, rather, outdated and boring design. Wake up Mr. Reyes, it's 2001."
1,"Junk, Junk, Junk (But at a bargain price!)","What do you expect, right? $25 for a product that everyone else charges much more for...This was a Costco purchased model.First let's just say that it ceased working after about 6 months. Hard to complain too much given the disposable price. (Though the decade old blade grinder still works fine and cost about half.)Messy operation, serious static charge issues, coffee would literally jump from the container when opened.The burning motor smell infected the grounds at times, giving your cup-a-joe a fine burnt taste.Very difficult to clean and clogged easily.I would pass on this item and try something else. Though maybe you'll get lucky and get one that will last more than a few months."
4,better than $50 capresso,"bought $50 capresso burr grinder first. Quit using it after only a few months. It gave very uneven grinding. Bought this as a cheap replacement. It has been great. No more wondering if I need more beans or used to many. The grind is uneven, but the dust tends to collect along the lip. I just spoon it off before dumping the rest of the grinds in the coffee maker. Burr grinders do not heat beens when grinding, so they are a good choice for the avid coffee drinker. Best grinder under $50."
4,Whoa! It's better than that . . .,"After receiving the Mr. Coffee BMX3 as a gift and then checking its review here, I almost returned this grinder unopened. What a mistake that would have been. This BMX3 is compact, easy to operate, and a great deal quieter than my other burr grinder, the Braun KMM30. What is more, whereas the Braun is ridiculously messy to operate (because of the loose way in which the bottom hopper attaches to the machine's body), the Mr. Coffee is a snap. Cleaning the unit iself is simple, and it leaves less mess on the countertop than I would have expected from any burr grinder.I would prefer a larger upper hopper for beans, but this is because I am lazy. I have no idea regarding longevity, but at $25, it seems a bargain."
1,great....for a short while it becomes a piece of crap,"worked great. But, you get what you pay for. It quit working after a few months. I guess Mr. Coffee still goes with the time honored tradition of planned obsolescense. Now I remember why I won't buy their products. Buyer BEWARE!"
2,Worked great for a while,"I had my first grinder for about 4 months and then it just stopped working, returned it for another and that one didn't work from the get-go. Run, run as fast as you can away from this grinder. Many cheaper ones work much better."
1,Junk - Don't waste your time or money on it,"All the settings are too coarse for even a drip machine. Forget about using for an expresso machine. The top burr grinder vibrates loose from the bottom burr after grinding about 6 cups worth of beans, and needs to be ""cleaned"" and ""relocked"" before grinding again. The static causes the grinds to fly everywhere. There is no way to return it or even speak to customer service. A waste of time and $30. I am going to put this thing in the garbage and buy a real grinder - like a Solis. I tried to save money and I ended up wasting $30."
2,Mr. Coffee Burr Mill Coffee Grinder - BMX3,"Works great when it works. I have had two, and the switch failed in both in the first year. Figured the first was a fluke. After two, not so sure."
2,"Works well, until it dies...","Mine worked well for a few months, then one day just simply stopped working. I went over & over all the auto-off locking mechanisms on the device to make sure that wasn't the problem, but to no avail. Simply stopped working (perhaps a blown interior fuse?). And the nearest authorized service rep is over a 1.5 hr drive away."
2,lasted two years of once/twice a day use,"After that, the safety on the bean hopper stopped working, so you'd have to hold the lid down to get a grind. Then, (it was never very stable) it managed to slide right off the table while grinding. The lid broke, and it broke for good.I guess two years is decent for disposable consumer goods from low-cost Chinese manufacturers. But I think I'll try another brand for my next grinder."
2,Built-In Gremlin Makes Product Annoying,"This would be a crackerjack little grinder if it always worked. As it is, it's frustrating to be looking forward to that fresh ground cup, only to find Mr. Coffee has taken the day off."
4,Mr. Coffee Burr Grinder,"I haven't gotten a chance to use my new burr grinder, but it looks to be good quality and the price was very reasonable compared to other burr grinders."
2,Too good to be true,"I had this mill for 2 weeks before it just quit working. It was a pain to clean and it just felt cheap overall. When I took it back to exchange it, I noticed several other returned units behind the counter and the rep told me that this burr mill is returned on a daily basis. I ended up just getting a refund and investing that money into a burr mill that was more expensive. There is a night and day difference with the more expensive mill. It has solid construction, is easy to clean, and best of all, it still works after 2 weeks. Don't let the price of this unit fool you. The motor is just too weak and cheap to be used in a burr mill. Save your money and get a more expensive unit."
1,I'm just glad I could return it for a full refund,Like the other reviewer I purchased this at Costco the BMX5 model. I didn't clean it every time but very often or it would jam the motor. It is deafeningly loud. Very unnerving. The one nice thing about it was the cup settings were perfect for 2 tablespoons per 6 oz. cup. But it didn't matter because it died after 3 months and now I have learned that it didn't make the best quality tasting grind either. I've tried two other brands since. Buy anything other than this.
2,Poor design- not worth it,"I thought that this was a great price to pay for a burr grinder. However, a key feature of the grinder malfuctioned and broke within 3 months of purchase. The bin that the ground coffee goes into must be engaged, locked in, to a little tab in the base of the grinder. Within no time at all we had a hard time getting the tab to stay put. Within 3 months we were holding it in place during the entire grinding. We tried cleaning it, but that didn't work. It is a real shame, because the grinder itself works great."
1,product was not made for my computer,"I had to return this product as it was not compatible with my computer as stated. The connector was too long for the port. The item was returned and credited. They did not credit me for postage, which they should have done. The item was falsely advertised as for my Gatewat 200ARC. I am not happy with both the transaction and being charged for shipping! I will not be too anxious to order from Amazon after this. Lois Green"
1,These guys are deleting my review!!!!,"I bought this item before. But I found this item was actually not either equivalent to the Samsung AD-6019, nor did fit to my Samsung laptop. I had to send it back by my own shipping cost. I wrote my review about this item before, but I think they deleted it. So BE AWARE!!!!"
5,A GREAT FORGOTEN BOOK,"I read it more than 20 years ago, but this book should be read by any reader who likes a good novel, with very good writing. Read it. It would make a great movie or tv minimovie."
4,A very useful tool,This dictionary proved to be of impressive value at the time of producing product information for out sales force related to nutritional products and aromatherapy.
1,Useless,"After attempting find a use for this book in my studies, I came to the conclusion that I could not. It does not have very much useful information, the authors' position is silly and naive. Reading this book without substantial study elsewhere will not help you understand the origins of the Bible or its purpose. It maks assumptions which can only be labelled as religiously biased. For instance, it offers no substantial evidence for its claim of the oral roots of the biblical text. It assumes that the Bible has a view that is similar to that of today's readers. The authors do not understand the huge differences or the similarities between modern peoples and the ancients. If some offers this book to you, say thanks but no thanks, there are much better ones out there."
3,old,"y would you buy this game for sega when you can buy madden 2001 which is 1,000,000X better for playstation or nintindo? beside how many of us still own segas that actually work?"
3,Not very good quality,"These were definitely not as good as I had expected after reading the other reviews. The quality is not very good. They are stamped forks and the edges are not smooth and polished. Also, some of my forks arrived bent! But I guess I shouldn't have expected much at such a cheap price. Note that in the seller's return policy it states ""We do not guarantee satisfaction on any merchandises."""
3,Cheap forks are cheap,"My spouse has this thing for tossing forks out with the trash unintentionally and it was time to get some more. If you need cheap basic forks that you don't mind losing, Dominion Medium Weight Flatware Dinner Forks will fulfill that role. The metal tines move easily. That's not really a complaint. 36 forks for $9 +SH. We got what we paid for and we intend to lose them. No big spend, no big loss."
3,OK,These are cheaply made and very lightweight forks that do an ok job. If you are looking for decent quality please go elseware.
5,Luxbacher's the Best!,"I've read all of Luxbacher's soccer books. Judging by how he writes, he's one of the best youth coaches in America. I've incorporated many of Luxbacher's drills and small-sided games into my sons' teams' practices. Luxbacher and publisher Human Kinetics are the best in America!"
3,Fun Training Games,"This book shows many training games. It tells you how to do it and shows a picture. The game I liked best is the 4 Zone passing game. Each games tells you the objectives, equipment, organization, directions and coaching points. I liked this book because it has games that I like."
4,Pictures gallore,"Excellent pictorials, of North-American and international engines, a Must for any collector."
2,Good lock but they really dropped the ball,"When I got my strap I was really excited about it but, that excitement wore off as soon as I saw that, because my guitar has the pin in the back of the guitar, the only way of fitting the lock in it would make the design of the strap backwards and there is no way to fit it any other way. If the lock is design to only be able to fit it one way, at the very least it should say in the description that guitars that have the forward pin in the back of the body will not be able to use this locks."
1,Does not fit!,"If you're gonna charge $25 for a freakin guitar strap, there should be guitar models listed that it will not fit as it did not fit mine!"
5,What a wonderful approach!,"I love the approach this author has taken with the Collected Traveler. It offers so much more depth as additional reading and background than the traditional travel guides.I really appreciate the amount of thoughtful recommendations for web-sites, travel companies, other books and commentaries that this book includes."
2,A Tough Slog,"Having read The Making of Kind Of Blue just previous to this book, and seeking an insight into Bill Evans, I was quickly disappointed by the academic approach to this book. I'm not a pianist and I don't read music, though I am a musician, and the dry details of every gig and recording were little more stimulating than the reading out loud of a schedule book, in my opinion. The sheer volume of names, sometimes dozens to a page, was mind-numbing--even though I recognized every one.Music is best appreciated when listened to, not read about, so in my opinion this book deserves to be on the high and dusty shelves of a conservatory library rather than on my shelf next to the dynamic biographies of Miles Davis and yes, Elton John--books that really gave me an insight into the people behind the music."
2,Did he do other research than reading liner notes?,"Had the nerve to trash ""Nirvana,"" a great record. Pettinger's commentary, unless straight out technical analysis, rarely rises above summarizing liner notes. He misses the man Bill Evans completely."
3,let the music do the talking,"I've been around a lot of ""musicians"" in my day and they make me ill. It amazes me that musicians talk more than they play and very few have kind words towards each other. I'll take any information I can get on Bill Evans and I'm glad a biography has finally come out. But words really don't matter. The bottom line is that Bill Evans did more with one note than countless musicians can do in an entire show. Bill Evans kicked ass on piano and nobody can ever touch him."
4,Very informative.,"I love reading anything about Bill Evans. I wished it were more personal. Although every so often there would be very little personal highlights, I did learn more about him. Anyone studying Bill Evans should read this. I plan to read it again. I heard about this book by Tony Bennett mentioning it on the Bill Evans Tony Bennett album."
3,Close,"There is a great book in the life of Bill Evans. Contributor to one of Miles Davis' greatest groups and indespensible to the resultant recording 'Kind of Blue'. Founder and core of the great Bill Evans Trio with Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian. Touring and recording from the late 1950's up until late September of 1980 creating often profound music and redefining the sound of jazz piano, Evans is one of the real giants of the music.Unfortunately, this is not that great book. The descriptions of the recordings are excellent and the author provided real insight into how the music itself works. The story of Bill Evans the person is not told here. Bill never springs to life in the pages of this book as he does on his recordings. The intelligent, articulate and apparently humorous fellow eludes us in this biography."
3,Not really a biography,"As stated by at least one other reviewer, this book is not really a biography, it's a discography. If you're new to Bill Evans and want to read about his recorded works to help you decide which albums you want to explore, then this is a good book for you. But if you want to learn about the ""life"" of Bill Evans, don't waste your time. You won't learn much here."
3,The only book on Bill Evans with a major drawback,"This books covers extensively the theoretical and practical aspect of the music of Bill Evans (e.g. recordings, concerts) but unfortunately does not life up to my expactations if it comes to a BIOgraphy of the artist. Only sparse information on his private life, very little first-hand accounts by former fellow musicians and almost no elaboration on his personality. From my point of view it is worth reading, not only since this is the only biography on Bill Evans, but it seems to be obvious to me that the author tried to write this book with as little thourough work as possible on the biographical aspect of Bill Evans life. He almost exclusively relies on an account of recording sessions and concerts where he gives a valuable insight into the music of this important jazz pianist."
5,Loving this Mandarin Video,"My 2 elementary boys are picking up Mandarin from watching Bin Bin. On top of that, the video is designed in such a way that it helps calming them. The graphic of the video is very picturesque and serene. The music is very soothing. The characters are cute and they speak in a very peaceful, kind and comforting tone. I look forward to listening to the stories while doing my chores every time I see my boys putting the Bin Bin DVD in the player! Mom loves it and boys love it!"
3,"okay, but confusing","The first time I played this game I used this straategy guide, it helped me a whole lot, but the item lists and maps were very confusing. But the walkthrough really helped me. I reccomend it to people that have a general feel for these types of games."
1,HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book never came to my house so i emailed them and they did not respond to my email.
5,Cut to the Chase,"This book truly does speak to both the new as well as the seasoned teacher. What I appreciated the most was the author's ability to ""cut to the chase"" in the area of teaching reading. I am especially excited about using the reading folder she uses to store both teacher assessments and student responses to reading. The section on what the ""other kids are doing"" while the teacher is working with a guided group was extremely valuable as was her description of SSR. I knew something wasn't quite right with my class SSR time, and this book not only identified the problem but provided a logical and do-able alternative. Whether a teacher is new and needs the basics of teaching literacy or is experienced and needs help pulling out what are the best teaching practices, this book is superb!"
1,Not what I ordered,The book I was sent was not the one pictured. I had to return it because it was nothing like the book shown even though it had the same title.
5,I love Puff,I always loved Puff the magic dragon by Peter Paul and Mary. To have this beautiful short tale come to life in an amazing and beautiful pop up book is such a joy. My four year old grandchild loves to sing along with the cd and lovingly turns each page.
2,"Great Song, Lame Book","I read so many great reviews about this book that I couldn't wait to get it for my children, but when I did, we were sorely disappointed. The story is just the lyrics to the song, so there's not much depth to it. The illustrations still continue after the ""song"" ends, to make it seem that Puff makes a new friend after Jackie Paper leaves him, which does make it more kid friendly. It's not as sad, but that dosen't make for a good story. Plus if they were going to adhere exactly to the song, why did they change the ending? If they were going to change the ending they should have changed the content too so that one could actually read a cool book about a dragon, friendship and growing up, instead of just singing a silly song. I loved the illustrations but if I wanted to read the lyrics to ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" I would have just bought the CD."
4,Puff Comes to Life with Twist Ending,"Review by Sherry North, Author, Because You Are My BabyThe classic song about a boy who grows out of his love for a dragon pal lends itself beautifully to a children's book. The illustrations are simple yet intriguing without being overly cartoonish, as Puff and Jackie Paper act out the verses of the song. And the illustrator adds a lovely twist - a new friend for Puff - to help soften the song's bittersweet ending.I only have two cautions about this book. One is that even with the new ending, the part where Jackie stops visiting Puff is still very sad. Sensitive children might feel heartbroken for a bit. And my other complaint is that the book uses the exact lyrics of the song, except for one place: ""Dragons live forever, but not so little boys and girls."" Adding girls here completely ruins the rhythm and was unnecessary. Girls won't feel left out, because the illustrations show a girl befriending Puff at the end."
5,A MUST HAVE for library of any age,"Worth the wait...illustrations are fab! The story is known to all, but the visuals are what really draw you into this book...my 7 year old son has chosen it every night since it arrived as his bedtime story! I've sent it to several adults for their ""inner child""...a must have for every library!"
5,beautiful book,"Love the artwork in this book, it follows the song and the author adds a note about the original poem. Makes a great gift."
3,With just a little more effort...,"Given such a rich subject matter the illustrations should have been more creative. The simplicity and harmony of the original song is lacking on the version provided with the CD so I just play the original version when reading/listening with my son. Doing that also avoids the horrible ""but not so little GIRLS AND boys"" lyrics revision, at least for pre-readers. There's a typo in the book that annoys me: I believe the words are ""Pirate ships would lower their *flags*..."" -- in the book it's singular: flag. I personally like the happy ending that the book suggests, though. Summary: my son loves it, and I like it as long as I can listen to the original version of the song while we read."
4,good book,good book and cd. book is just the song but its easy for kids to remember it and help you read it.
3,poor CD,"Book was nice, recording was awful. I did not pass the CD on to my grandchild. I would not like them to remember the song sung like that."
5,Gorgeous book,"You already know the legendary story, so I don't need to tell you how great that is. There's also a CD that my kid really likes with the song on it and a few other folksy tracks. But the really outstanding thing is the beauty of the illustrations and the quality of the pop-ups. I think I might like it as much as my kid!"
1,Very disappointing,"We were looking for a ""book on tape"" that our kids could listen to in the car or play at home and follow along with the book. All the CD has is 4 songs. The book just has the lyrics to the song and no actual story."
3,Questionable?,"I remember reading this book when I was a kid and lately I am not so sure that this is a book to be read to younger children.It seems to me that it is a book with weird imagery and slight references to drug use.I coulde be worng but I know I am not alone in this asumption.I am all for kid's exercising their imagination, I just don't agree with this book."
5,Beautiful!,Beautiful hardcover book with brilliant full color page illustrations and CD! Very well made...beautiful presentation!!! I plan to give it to my best friend who LOVES the title song and I am proud to be able to give her such a high quality keepsake for her to treasure for many years.
4,Looking for more...,"I picked up The Marzipan Pigeon for $1 at a used book store because I thought the cover looked cool. That's how graphic designers usually shop. But as I started reading it, I was very impressed by Alyssa Donati's voice. Her style of writing really got me, even the occasional cliche one-liners made me laugh. Though the ending to this particular story became pretty obvious by about halfway through the book, it still made a great read. I am very interested in reading more by Donati, but it looks like this is the only work she's had published -- even though the author bio on the dust jacket of Marzipan Pigeon says she was already busy with her second book. Curiouser and curiouser..."
3,An all-too-true account of what it means to be in love,A markedly accurate piece of modern-day fiction. Donati captures the essence of the crazed and sometimes depressing state of loving someone too much. Frighteningly REAL...
2,Wants to be Catcher In The Rye...,"...but the author has nowhere near the level of talent to pull it off. Salty, our ostensible heroine, lives in a dream world, naive beyond belief, although we are supposed to believe she grew up in Manhattan? Doesn't wash. Some parts of the book were amusing, but the characters are very unsympathetic and the dialogue was just plain silly in spots."
1,Worst Episode Ever,"This software is amazingly awful. I mean, it is embarrassing that a human was part of its creation. Completely useless, not in any way intuitive, and pretty much provides no really accounting. I switched to QuickBooks and everything was good. Still not the best program ever, but it provides a small business owner with 99% of what you need to truly manage your books.MS Office Accounting - I honestly cannot think of a single person who could ever use this."
5,A great product,I was very happy with this upgrade and the added features. A very worthwhile upgrade.
4,Being your own advocate,"I purchased this for a friend--meant to be a tool to read before going through the actual steps of processing the divorce. Book was full of information and advice. As an outsider looking in, going though a divorce is beyond difficult, this little book can be read cover to cover as an educational tool prior to going to see any lawyer. Not all of the information will apply to you, but I'm a firm believer information leads to knowledge, and knowledge leads to power."
2,not enough padding,"I bought this booster for my 6 year old and he said that it is OK, but not nearly as comfortable as the Graco Turbo (no back) booster we have in our second car. The padding is pretty minimal, so I am returning it for another Graco."
3,Interesting,"Other than there being too much carrying over info from Cunningham's first book, I enjoyed it."
3,Taiho-Jutsu: Law and Order in the Age of the Samurai,"""Taiho-Jutsu: Law and Order in the Age of the Samurai"" is a very nice book for people, who want to get a simple view of Japanese society, regulations and law enforcement agencies (including their equipment) during the Edo-period.In general the book is very easy to read and filled with nice and informative illustrations.However, for readers, who already know Cunningham's ""Secret Weapons of Jujutsu"", the book gives the impression to be an updated edition of his first work. Most of the information can be found in both books."
4,The whole world agrees to shout at the same time,A royal little boy (aren't they all) would like to hear the loudest noise in the world. The agreement is that all of the people in all of the world will scream at the top of their lungs to amuse this little prince. There's a trick ending that you and your child will enjoy - especially you.
5,Perfect for the woman that seems to attract Jekyll/Hyde type,"I can't tell you how much this helped to analyse why I seem to find myself with those type of men. You know the type I'm talking about, they are sweet when you meet then and as long as they are the center of your world. Once the novelty has worn off they become bitter and lash out.The book helped me immensely."
2,A chore to read,"While I can understand that some people have been affected by this book, I was not. I found the entire story bland and predictable. Not only that, but it was unbelievably cheesy too. It was not hard to predict that Prince Charming was going to be abusive, or that the Princess would remain with him because she could love him back to normal. These are the themes that modern movies portray and it doesn't surprise me that people grow up believing that it's true. This is a poorly written fix for those people who were unfortunate enough to believe what Disney told them about relationships."
4,Life Lessons ... sought... and taught...,"Though it was a bit hard to swallow in the format of a fairy tale, in the end I have dog-ear'd several pages and will refer to the life lessons it holds. I will also share this book with several friends and family members who are struggling with the curve balls life throws. This book is for anyone needing that wake-up call to say 'you can get through it' among other lessons... The Princess will learn with you."
5,Awesome,"I had bought this for my sister's birthday, and she loved it. Apparently the color black is big right now, and so is playboy bunny. This charm is double the fad so I highly recommend it. And it's surgical steel to prevent irritation/infection, so that means A++.It's the perfect size where it doesn't get pulled by your belt, and you can actually see the charm. Because it's silver and shined to a sheen and the clasp holding the charm to the end of the barbell isn't too tight, it shimmers in the light with every movement. Very nice :)"
2,Low cost encyclopedia of battles,"Good encyclopedia, probably for high school students. Lack of biblical sources. Most of the battle maps are unclear and meaningless. The subtitle 'Accounts of Over 1,560 Battles from 1479BC' might be more meaningfull if the book included a battle time table. Even the old Compton Battles of The World CD ROM is much better. Probably this encyclopedia is the best on 1967, but not for 2005.I suggest The Oxford Companion to Military History, as light encyclopedia of battles. And for real history go for more serious work like Charles Philips, Encyclopedia of War (Fact on File Library of World History)."
4,unnecessarily crude and rather incomplete,"The author's descriptions of modern paramilitary torture did not surprise this reader. However, his need to pepper the descriptions with vulgarities and obscenities was rather disturbing. The book does demonstrate ""rough and ready"" techniques of torture but fails to capture the elegance of low-tech medieval solutions. The modern procedures may be effective, but a crudely built wooden foot squeezer operated by hand-made iron screws is far more ingenious and intellectually appealing than any of Krousher's 20th-century procedures."
2,KROUSHER IS A ...,"Although a lot of the information is accurate, I got the distict impression that Richard enjoyed writing this book far more than was appropriate! 100 reasons why one oughta eat one's gun rather than be captured alive in some backwards 3rd world hellhole! NOT for the squeamish (or anyone else for that matter!)."
4,Scary Stuff - Physical Interrogation is...,"I read this book from cover to cover. Picture yourself driving down the highway; you notice a huge accident happen about 20 cars in front of you. Traffic stops. Do you get out and try to help? Do you get out to look? How about when you drive by an accident that happened recently? Why do you look at it? Trying to see dead bodies? Decapitations? Gross, huh? But you just can't help looking!! This book is the same way.It was incredibly difficult to put down. The ideas are sound. The whole thing makes sense; from the nakedness as a break-down technique to humble your target, to the passage about the eyeball. Don't ask - just read the book. You will certainly be grossed out. You will definately look at Physical interrogation (AKA ""Torture"") in whole new manner.... FEAR!!"
2,I didn't buy into alot of this information,"Alot of this information obviously was not accrued from actual experience so the validity is in question. I'm sure alot of the techniques are very painful, but I think better research should've been done. A taboo subject like this and ""snuff films"" is difficult to write about, but there is evidence out there. You just have to dig really hard and search in some dark places. Krousher didn't go to this level and I'm disappointed on the whole."
2,Mostly Worthless Information-unless you're a sicko!!!!,"The title of this book shouldn't be, ""Physical Interrogation Techniques"", it should be, ""How to Inflict Needless Pain on Somebody"". I'm pretty sure, without experiencing them, that the procedures in the book really do work, as far as inflicting pain. However, whether or not a person would give truthful information under duress is beyond me. Most of the actions described in the book are pretty much common sense (now that they're mentioned), nothing that would make one think to himself, ""Wow, how did they think of that?"" I think this book might even be found in the ""novelty"" row at the local ""new world"" bookstore..."
4,The rare sequel that lives up to the original,"This is a sequel to what was possibly Kathleen Eagle's best book. I was nervous about her revisting these characters. This is true to the original and enhances it rather than detracts for it. Tommy T has grown up in to be a man and to have family conflicts firmly rooted in the Tommy T we knew as a child. Never explotative nor preaching about mixed heritage or Native American traditions, the theme of Native American tradition is perfectly used to move the plot forward.This romance deals deftly with drug use and it's effect on a family, culture clash, age difference in couples, and the bravery it takes to hope. A really fine book well worth buying in hardcover."
3,3 Stars,"Review written for www.books-n-kisses.comThis is an interesting story but I was really confused for a lot of it. I was even more confused about the ""elsewhere"" sections (you have to read it to understand). The characters and the storyline keep your attention but something about it just didn't work for me. I never felt the connection between Tom and Cassandra. This story was just so oddly written that it was hard to follow.Disclaimer:I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."
3,"Good, not great","Having read about 20 of Kathleen Eagle's books, I was disappointed by this one. The dialog is quite good - an Eagle strong point - but the pendulum swing of emotions is sometimes unbelievable, and not always clearly explained. An enjoyable read, but not destined to be read over and over like her better works (This Time Forever, A Reason to Believe). I wish I had waited for the paperback."
2,camo on the case is aweful,"The case shipped with no protection material at all. When I looked at it. The yellowish camo on the case makes the case looked like used. The plastic is not strong. Therefore, the tray inside does not fit properly in the case. I doubt that it will hold in place with the weight of the ammo packs on the tray. Overall it is not a good case. cheap looking and probably will not last long."
1,Waste of money!,"I purchased this box thinking that it would be made with some strength to it. I was wrong, because it is of cheap thin plastic, with plastic latches that cannot hold any weight without breaking off when carrying it.It is simply junk at this price, or any. Buy better quality and it will cost you more.Mine will be returned tomorrow."
5,Lee Greenwood American Patriot,"An awesome CD. I am a 20 year veteran of the Armed Services. While stationed with the 3rd Infantry Division in Germany in the early 80's when Lee first cut ""God Bless The USA"". I identified completely with this song. It is hard to put into words about what it means to be an American, but Lee Greenwood has done it and more. Since the first time I heard this song I knew it was destined for greatness!"
4,INSPIRATIONAL,"THIS IS A SONG THAT SHOULD GO UP THERE ALONG WITH GOD BLESS AMERICA. AS IT LETS US KNOW THAT WE MAY HAVE TAKEN A PUNCH IN THE EYE WE DID NOT DROP TO OUR KNEES. WATCH OUT WORLD, GOD BLESS AMERICA"
4,Good,It's a fine CD and has some good songs especially God Bless The USA but I wonder why they put Oh Holy Night which is a Christmas song on a CD where the rest of the songs are non-seasonal. I love Christmas songs and I listen them throughout the whole month of December and when I played this CD for the first time the other day and Oh Holy Night came up my family was like why are you listening to Christmas music in April?
4,Sheer Bonaducian Paradox,"Lee Greenwood, despite his puzzling mixture of Bonaducian facial expressions and obvious desire to exude a Neil Diamond charisma, manages to promote a compelling work of musical performance art.The only troubling aspect of Greenwood's forceful parody is that his work is such ""over the top"" parody that at times he seems to be mocking the brave patriots residing in the United States.Whether his aim is true or a mere scoffing of protagasubterfuge, Lee Greenwood is a spirited musical force to be reckoned with, not unlike Joanna Went or LA & Maddog."
4,Great classic sound,"Mostly a blues CD. The rock/gospel ""Are you ready"" is primarily what I bought the CD for. I remember that song from the late 60's when I was still in high school."
3,Jeeze Louise!,"Here is an example of why reading reviews before you purchase is important.Hope you have time and energy and maybe YOU get the ""how to"" instructions to put this thing together. If you are not adept at assembly, frequent IKEA stores, or (a must) have someone to help you to assemble this beast - forget it. If on the other hand you do have patience, buy it because it is a good deal and a helpful golf aid. (I sometimes think my game may be improving) If you get the thing assembled, the use of rubberbands helps to secure the poles to their most inadequate pins. We are currently making peg extensions in the hopes that the net stops jumping out of the ground with each ball hit or hefty breeze. And if your net arrives sans instructions, don't bother to call or contact the manufacturer as this appears to be a discontinued item and no one seems to give a rats a**. I have given the product 3 stars because I have licked the beast! HA take that!K in San Jose, CA"
2,Not extremely portable,"Positive:-Size, good surface area-Chipping netNegatives:-Poor instructions-Very hard to set up by yourself. Really takes 2 people, because nothing fits tight, so as you try to get one side in, the other side pops out.-Nothing locks in. Plastic caps to hold rear poles don't fit tightly. The 'male' sticks that go into the 'female' section of the rear poles are not tight, so a wind from the rear pushes it over.I have had to make some modifications to this item to make it usable. I taped some eyelets to the bottom of the rear poles and attached to ring with caribiners. I've had to tape the caps onto the top of the rear poles and add some tape to the ends of the front pole to make it snug."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$,"Brutal, horrible instructions! No pictures! No clear, concise steps to follow. It took 2 people to set up and just as previous reviewers mentioned, nothing fits properly. It's very flimsy and unsteady. I was extremely frustrated and dissapointed in this product so I returned it. Don't waste your time and money. Spend a little more and get a better product."
3,LONG setup time!,"This item is not for someone that wants it setup in a couple of minutes. The items they give you, to setup the net are a bit cheesey. With some mods to the device, it would be just OK. I sent it back.Good instructions, might have helped in receiving it. Pictures always work!! =)"
1,Do NOT Purchase,"This thing is very difficult to erect and it lasted not more than 3 months as the netting actually rotted out---such a waste of money- AMAZON should be ashamed to sell this product, Ronald C. Burger"
1,Worse purchase ever!,I received the product with no assembly instructions. Contacted Amazon and they quickly sent a second net with NO!!! assembly instructions (which I can tell was returned before because the net was stuffed in the bag). I called Wilson and they stated that the product is made by a company that they license to use their name. I called the company (Applesports) and did not get an answer. Tried to find them on the net and was unsuccessful. I will be returning both nets and purchase something different. Don't buy this product!
1,dangerous product,"First of all, as the others reviewers pointed out< the instruccions for assembly are horrible. Second, the net is of very low quality; it pierced in less than 3 month. It was very scary hearing that ball boucing off three diferent houses after a ball pierced a hole thru it."
3,Ok While it lasted,"I'm shopping around for a new case, Any Suggestions? The belt clamp on this one broke soon after i purchased it, now I only use it when I put my nano away in a bag or something. On a good note, I liked how accessible the controls were and how well the case protected my nano. I've dropped it several times while inside the case, so far no scratches."
1,so close but so far,"ugh wheen i first got it i thought it was great, a few days later i took my nano out of the case the screen was SCRATCHED i am planning on going to aple and geting myself a new ipod, (igot the case a an apple store)do not buy"
4,Nice case with one design drawback,"I like the appearance of this case very much, and it does a great job of protecting my iPod. The one problem that I've had is with opening it to connect it to my computer. In order to open it wide enough to connect the docking cable, you have to remove your headphones from their jack. Other than that, though, it's very nice and will get you compliments. The built-in cord management for your headphones is also very useful"
3,Not what I expected.,"The thumb screws I received were not the same ones in the Amazon picture. They work, but the grip when turning isn't as good and they look hideous....I can't really recommend getting your thumb screws (Or any semi-generic item like this) on Amazon because I was told anyone can change the picture... so you really have no idea what you will be sent.The ""..."" and awkward wording was a workaround of things Amazon would not allow me to post for absolutely no reason at all. They don't actually violate any Amazon guidelines and were just an explanation of my experience buying these."
3,Hawkwind - 'Oscillations' (Universal Int'l),"Only reason I'm giving this title a three-star rating is because the sound quality is very good.Most of these eight(8)cuts were taken from the 'Space Ritual II' disc(see my review),except for ""Hurry On Sundown"" and ""Paranoia"" which were pulled from an early appearance on the BBC.Obviously,for completists only.In fact,'Oscillations' is SO much for the extreme die-hards,it hurts."
4,Solid camera bag,"Bag arrived in great shape, good workmanship, etc. However, I did not realize the size of the bag when I ordered it. It was smaller than I expected, but that's really my fault as the info was there on the item description and I just missed it. Anyway, if you are wanting to take a good bit of equipment along with you, this is not the bag you want. However, if you don't have so much stuff to pack, this is a well made, fairly versatile bag."
4,Good for the Panasonic DMC-FZ35,"I was going to give a description of the bag and compartments, but others have done so. I'll just let you know that the FZ35 will fit in this bag with the lens hood attached. Room for other accessories also.You can't get excited and go swinging it around and whack a tree, or Fred. You'll break the camera. But, it is well protected against normal bumps and bruises."
5,Great bag for compact camcorder plus accessories,"The Lowepro EX-140 is a great bag for a compact camcorder plus accessories. I'm able to store my Panny TM700 camcorder vertically on one side of the case; an extra battery, battery charger, and a power cord fit on the other side. There's also a front pocket I use for video and USB cables, and a small pocket on the front flap that appropriate for thin items like extra SD cards.The case isn't the most padded camera case I've seen, but the construction is solid and for typical household / tourist / hobbyist use it seems like it should protect its contents well. I've had this bag for a few months now and I'm quite satisfied with it."
4,Martha's best Christmas book yet!,"This book has the most sofisticated ideas yet that Martha has shown in one of her books. The Christmas ornament projects are dressy and luxurious, not country and rustic. A great book for those of us who want to be creative but still have class!"
1,Can't be trusted once again!,"I was saddened and surprised to discover that instructions for both of the first two projects I attempted in this book were flawed, one mildly, the other catastrophically. The first project, the beaded wreath gives an inaccurate number of needed bead leaves by at least twenty. However, the template for the fabric covered Christmas ornament is completely unworkable. She instructs using 6 pieces of fabric to cover the ornament yet her template does not have the needed 1:3 ratio of height to width necessary. After ruining lots of expensive velvet fabric following her instructions I finally figured out what was wrong. Until the editors can check on accuracy in the instructions I suggest you pass up on this book."
2,lots of stuff similar to crafts done in her magazine,"i like martha stewart, subscribe to her magazine and bought last year's christmas book, but this one is missing something. to me, lots of the ideas i've seen before either in her magazine or on her tv show. some of the ideas were great as usually, but they're not worth the price of the book."
4,Pretty to look at !,"I have found that Martha Stewart books are to be viewed rather than used as a basis for trying to make anything because her instructions and recipes are often convoluted and/or incorrect. I just do not understand why, with her vast resources, Martha does not hire better and more thorough editors and testers.So now I just look at her books for the visual pleasure they bring me! That way I avoid any frustration associated with implementation. And this one gave me lots of beautiful things to look at: the fruit wreath, the silvery pine cones, the beautifully done petits fours, the handmade ornaments, the gorgeous cookies.Even if the directions were perfectly clear, I know I still would not make many of these things...but a gal can dream, can't she?"
4,It's Classic Martha!,"Even if you aren't a true fan of Martha, you will enjoy her book filled with decorating and crafting ideas that you can either incorporate into your own traditions or expound upon to revise them to your personal taste.It's a great book for your crafting collection!"
1,A waste of money,"This is an old book, so it looks dated. And the instructions are unclear and full of errors."
4,This was a pretty good book,"Core was fairly good sc-fi reading. If you aren't into novels that can get fairly heavy on technical details then you might want to think twice about reading this book. The plot is sometimes a little slow moving, but picks up at the end for a great finish. I understand Preuss has a few other novels in print, and if they are anything like Core then I would love to read them."
3,I Was a Spy,"I was intrigued with the cinematography of this movie and how authentic the costumes and interior design were. The acting was very good and the actors picked to portray the characters in this film were well chosen. Because the story is based on the espionage career (albeit a short one) of a real person, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. However, after half of the DVD was played, it stopped and I was unable to see how it ended. Up to then, I was enjoying the movie but I wish I knew what happened to her."
5,Surprise film,"This film surprised me, it was a very good story and despite being a bit dated as for spy techniques, was very entertaining."
4,Great watch!,"I love this watch. I did have to have a jewelry size it, but other than that it is beautiful and accurate."
4,Sweet,"This is a great story for all ages. Granted it doesn't have the same depth as The Goose Girl or Enna Burning, Princess Academy is a preteen friendly story for many a young woman. It teaches the values of choosing between ideals and what actually makes a person happy. Miri is a young girl with shortcomings of her own that many can relate to. There are, however, some darlings the author could have 'killed' (Faulkner) but there not too much where the story is one big, cushiony tall of fluffy goodness."
4,Great imagination in a rel world.,"Every woman dreams of becoming a princess, but few have the chance.A realistic view into demands of a prince or princess. Normal life has its rewards too."
4,A Good Read for Young Teens,"A good story for pre-teen and young teen girls about trusting in (and learning to find) your strengths. The story also opens up opportunities for the protagonist to discover clues about how others feel about themselves and about how others perceive the protagonist. This makes for a 'clunky' story-line upon occasion for this adult reader, but I can forgive the awkwardness of the thought/speech asides because children need to hear that the world is not just about them or all about their feelings. The community is upheld and respected within this story and the differences between characters -- and thus, the differences in the motivations for their actions is acknowledged and (in some cases) explained."
5,A wonderful school for thought,"I think Princess Academy is my favorite of Shannon Hale's three wonderful books. When the priests in the capital of Asland determine that Danland's prince will marry a girl from Mount Eskel's marble mining village, an academy is established for all eligible village girls so that they may gain the proper knowledge and skills to be choosen. Miri, with 19 other girls, is sent to the academy for a year. Along with Poise and Conversation, Miri finds information to help her village and discovers within herself what it truly means to be a princess, and not just in title.Also recommended: Goose Girl, Enna Burning (both by Hale), the Charlie Bone series"
5,I loved this book,"Don't let the childlike title and cover art fool you. This is a surprisingly deep and mature story. It has romance, action, mystery, self-discovery, and magical elements, all embedded within a unique plotline that kept me turning pages. The characters are interesting and multi-layered. The writing is beautiful and literary -- simple enough for my twelve-year-old daughter, but complex enough to keep an adult like me interested. I've avoided this book on my bookshelf for several months because it looked so childlike and simple. But my daughter praised it, so I reluctantly picked it up. And I'm so glad I did! I highly recommend it for anyone 9 years or older, especially girls and women."
5,My 6 Year Old Son Wouldn't Let Me Stop Reading,"I shouldn't have to say more. I read aloud to my children. ""The Tale of Desperaux"", ""Here Be Monsters"", and ""Goose Girl"" have been winners. ""Edward Tulane"" is among the sordid, forgotten tales that never engage their imagination.Getting and keeping the interest of a 5 and 6 year old without pictures is not always easy. Keeping the interest of a 6-year old boy in a story about Princesses is a textbook case in lunacy. But my son wouldn't let me stop. It only took 7 nights to read the entire book.Yes, it is about a girl at an academy for training rough-hewn mountain girls to be Princess candidates, but it is really about learning and power. It is about finding connection in your home and family and friends and finding strength through knowledge and a strong sense of justice.It was hard for me to resist reading ahead after they had fallen asleep. Read this book to your children."
4,Princess Academy,"While sometimes wordy, this book has a really catchy plot that is sure to grab and keep the reader's attention. The characters are fascinating dimensional people that the readers will really come to care about very early on in the storytelling. The story may feel predictable at times, and then all of a sudden it turns around and baffles the reader with astounding twists. It's a Newbery Honor winner, which, for kids, makes for some boring books, but this is a genuinely likable and interesting read, despite Newbery status. The title may involve the word 'princess', but it really isn't an overly girly book at all. It's a surprisingly original work of fantasy, although the storytelling has its low-tempered dull points. The end result of the princess picking is a little rushed, but adorable all the same. The romance throughout the book is subtle but sweet all the same, feeling like a marvelous new beginning rather than an ending.Rating: 4/5"
3,but a Newberry Honor book?,"Princess Academy was the second book I have read by Shannon Hale, and I don't plan to read any more. It was fine- but not great. Admittedly, Hale is a better than average writer. I was engaged with the plot- but a Newberry Honor book? No. What is it with Shannon Hale and rabbits? I wish I had counted- there must have been at least 6 occasions where she wanted to be sure she mentioned that the heroine had no problem with slaughtering them. OK, OK, we get it- Miri is a strong, politically correct heroine. She's not a girly-girl. (Maybe that's why the Newberry committee made it an honor book? Is there a quota for the ""strong girl as protagonist"" story?) It reached a point where it distracted from the story. I gave it 3 stars because of the redundancy. In the first book I read (Book of a Thousand Days) it was the same thing- but rats. I'm guessing I should expect that from any Hale book- and twice was enough."
5,Delightful story about Miri and Mount Eskel!,"Shannon Hale's PRINCESS ACADEMY is a delightful story about one very special your woman, Miri, (who doesn't think she is so special) and her creative ideas as she comes to know herself and her friends needs and abilities. PRINCESS ACADEMY is humorous, insightful, and occasionally suspenseful as Miri and her Mount Eskel friends learn about education, conversation, and manners. The novel teaches new insights for both YA readers and adults alike."
3,"Nice story, but predictable","Princess Academy is a nice story. The theme of whether Miri feels valuable to her family, her town and her friends is certainly one that kids / young adults will empathize with. Miri is a sweet character, but it's just a little too easy for her to solve all her problems - she's too perfect. And I just found it the plot a little too predictable. Cute, but not really an award winner for me."
1,Some questionable values,"As an adult reading this book, I was disappointed with some of lack of values in the book. The girls cheat on a test, one set of parents lies and force their daughter to lie and a teacher lies. None of these incidents have negative consequences. In fact, all of them ""pay off"". I did like how much the girls cared for their families and their community. They all worked really hard. But I can only recommend this book if there were a lot of discussion. Even then I'm not sure it's worth it. It had the potential of being an excellent book in many ways but fell short in the most important areas in my opinion."
1,hate it,I am a ten year old girl and an avid reader. I felt like I was being forced to read it. Sometimes I was sucked into it and wanted to keep reading it and then it would get really bad. It took me a month to read it. Normally it would take me a couple hours if it were really good.
3,Definitely one for the young girls,"I think what it boils down to is, I am definitely not the target audience for this book. Young girls (around 12 years old) should enjoy it (I'm pretty sure they'll love it). Being far older than that (in my very late 20s) and having read too much YA (why is there so much YA?) I found it predictable and only mildly entertaining. I'm pretty sure that if I'd come across the book 15 years ago, I would have been much more likely to view it more favorably. As it is, this is a book I would give to my young daughter, if I had one."
4,Adorable story,"Princess Academy is a great story to read. I thought the whole story was cute and sweet. Shannon Hale is such a talented writer that I have never been disappointed by her books. The voice she gives her characters just shines through. I would say Princess Academy is aimed at a younger audience (middle school), but I still enjoyed it. Miri is a great character. As a young girl, she is strong and tough despite her small stature. I loved that she used what she learned in Princess Academy to help her village. Princess Academy is a wonderful fairy tale. It is the kind of book I could not put down."
4,Magical feel-good story,"Princess Academy is the story of a group of village girls who are suddenly forced (by royal decree) to enter a school for princesses-in-training. After a few months of training, the crown prince will come to the school and choose the bride that suits him best. Although the story was perhaps a tad cliché, I found it very enjoyable. Probably more so, because I listened to the full-cast audio version of the book. It had magic, good morals, and happy endings--just as every de-Grimmed fairy tale ought. This is a good book for 4th-5th grade girls who enjoy fairy-tale fantasies."
4,glad I read it,"I'm a big fan of fantasy, but, at first glance, the title put me off. I'm not interested in reading yet another story of a teenage princess who saves the day. Fortunately, a friend of mine convinced me it's not that kind of book, so I read it. And I loved it!The Academy is a brilliantly used plot device that brings education and understanding to the people of Mount Eskel. The main character, Miri, facilitates this through her love of her village and the people in it. She goes through just the right amount of struggle to realize where she belongs, and learns how to make true friends. An inspiring story."
3,no depth,i thought it was an ok book but did not really great becuase of the fact that it never really got so goood that you could not put it down. if you are looking for a book that you ca just read in your spare time i think this is a good book for you. If you are looking for a book that you can not but down than this might not be the book for you.
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book with the full intention of having a good read. The first few pages caught my interest...but after a short while I found myself bored. Actually bored. Everything seemed too forced, rigid, mechanical. I tried to enjoy it -- believe me -- but in the end, I couldn't even finish the book.It is a goal of mine to eventually finish it. Unfortunately, forcing myself to read this is turning my favorite hobby into tedious work."
2,I Love Kids Literature But This Book Was Not My Taste,"I bought the book on the suggestion of other reviews but I was disapointed.I read the book and it seemed to have a slow start, there was a large assortment of characters though I felt they were not very well developed.I really don't suggest this tale. I am intereste dint he authors other ork but I will get it from the libray and not waste money purchasing them."
5,Works Great!,"Works great on laptop, camera and in desktop reader. Careful that you do not change the file format or else it will not work in your camera. I made this mistake and was not able to use it. Since I have fixed that it has worked great! Good speed!!"
4,The reviews are in...,"I've been using this CF card on my Nikon 4300 for a couple of months now. It writes fast compared to my other CF (Canon stock, from another camera). However, start up of the camera takes longer (because of the size), and as more pictures are stored, there is a noticeable degradation in speed in writing. I've also used this on a Dell Axim, and it worked great! No problem in formatting."
4,Doesn't fit well in my Canon A75,"The memory works fine, but it bothers me every time I have to take it out of the camera, because it gets stuck. However, I have measured it and it is just the same size of the Canon memory which came with the camera and with which I have had no problem. Perphaps it's fat in the middle..."
4,ohhh the ending,"I thought the book was really awesome, and I haven't even read the first one! I didn't like the ending, though, that's why it only gets 4 stars from me! I hope Dyan Sheldon decides to write a 3rd for a triliogy because I woould love a different ending. The book was good and I think anyone who likes mysteries and romance should read it. Just be prepared for tears at the end!"
2,It could have been so much better.,The first book left me breathless and waiting for more. This book sadly dissapointed me. B.J.'s comments and thought are sooooo repetitive! I don't like it how B.J. liked both girls and the fact that Angel isn't even grateful for what he did in the first book and that she sends him away. This is a crummy book.
4,Organized textbook for device engineers,I like this book because it is very organized written and it explains the concepts in a very intuitive and clear way. Good textbook for grad students learning device fundamentals. But it may be too simplified for the people who want to know all the details and physical origins.
5,LEFT HANDED KEYBOARD,A LEFT HANDED KEYBOARD ENABLES ME TO TYPE TWICE AS FAST AND THIS ONE WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE OLD ONE I HAD. LOOKS AND WORKS GREAT.
4,Great Product. A little learning curve,"This keyboard reminds me of the quality of the IBM keyboards of old. The seriousely audible click of the keys. The great tactile feedback. I ony have my left hand to work with, so it seemed logical to get this keyboard to reduce the repetative stress issues in my left shoulder. I am a programmer, so I spend 8 to 12 hours a day 5 to 7 days a week at my workstation coding. After 20+ years of using a ""Righties"" keyboard, I am slowly getting up to speed with this layout. Now I cross my body to use the mouse. While coding, 90% of my effort is used with the keyboard. If your a lefty, either by design, or by chance, get this keyboard! You will however, have to learn to mouse with your right hand if you have one to work with."
2,Loud Clicking Noise!,"I'm very happy to find a left handed keyboard, but the keys make a loud clicking noise with each press. It's very distracting to others in my office. I may not be able to continue using it. Only buy if a distracting noise will not bother yourself or others. I rated 2 stars because a modern keyboard should not have such an archaic design flaw."
2,not good,i just got this abot to week go or so and som key faiding way boo and cos to much dont bbuy it or you have right letter back and the esc is still on the left side wood lik on right sid will hop help guy
3,Good to use,"This keyboard is very useful for the leftys. Very simple to install and start using it. Also this keyboard is very strong.It would be much better if the ""Esc"" button placed on the top left corner. If the keyboard weight is reduced it would be great. If there is a wireless version that would be awesome."
3,Not as good at the Backyard Buffet but still fun,Not as much variation as Episode 1 Backyard Buffet but they still like to watch it. But I think they tire of just watching birds. More variation in the Backyard Buffet.
5,Good video,"Good video, my cat loves it. He stands up holding on to the TV station and stares. He also goes around and tries to find where the bird sound comes from. cute!"
1,Five minutes of entertainment for one cat; no interest for the other,"So, the headline really says it all. One cat watched for about 5 minutes, and the other cat couldn't care less. All in all a waste of money."
5,love butterflys,"I have three of these butterflys and they are beautiful.. Everyone comments on them, when they see them, how pretty they are.."
4,Truly moving,"This book tells the truth of what the government is really about, all need to read it and keep an open mind on the subjects in the book. Our freedoms are going away and no one is doing nothing about it. I will tell you this, I rather die, then give up any more freedom!"
3,A pretty mystery book for kids,Three kids in a junk yard and a talking skull make for an interestingcut on mystery and magic. There seem to be at least 25 in this seriesso that they remind one of the 30's Nancy Drew mysteries.I think there is enough action and suspense to keep a young reader interested.
5,Freedom,"Michael English is a fine talent who sings, writes, and interprets song & lyrics with great musicality. I strongly recommend him to others who are looking for an established but little known talent."
5,Psycho White Man Government,"Amazing that the Native Americans living today and in the past are called the trouble makers. Each war that broke out or incident that has taken place between the U.S. Government and Native Americans has been started because the white man and his greed just can't ever seem to be satisfied with his lust for money, control, or land from the Native American people. Then when Native Americans stand up for themselves after trying to please the devil whites they are labeled red savages! This book is an eye opener and written in a way that keeps your attention. This is one of the most factual books ever written with a color of truth that can't be denied."
1,Honeywell VisionPro 8000 Thermostat,I have had this thermostat for 3 years and have been generally happy with it except three times in the last 3 months it has suddenly tried to reach 90 degrees. Tech support at honeywell was rude and told me this was impossible and I must be doing something wrong. Filing a complaint got me a quick reponse that I could have a heating contractor come out and reset the unit and see if that solved the problem. They did not offer any advice on how I could reset the unit myself.This is far below the customer service levels I have received when I contacted Honeywell in the past. It appears to me that customer service has been farmed out overseas. I am waiting to see if it happens again. The unit has a 4 year warranty but it appears Honeywell has no intention of honoring it. My one star rating is more indicative of the customer service people than the product.
1,"Sergeants 3, Audience 0","If you thought ""Ocean's 11"" was a glorified home movie, wait until you see the Rat Pack's lazy Western remake of ""Gunga Din."" Some impressive Southern Utah scenery and Dean Martin's occasional asides cannot salvage this Frank Sinatra vanity production. Transporting Rudyard Kipling to the Old West proved a big mistake - made even worse by sloppy stunt work, cheesy exterior sets, and one of the lamest endings in cinema history. With Ol' Blue Eyes calling the shots, director John Sturges had little control over the amateurish hijinks. There's a reason why ""Sergeants 3"" never warranted a home-video release until 2008: It's a terrible film."
3,You need to see it,"Yes, you need to see this ""Rat Pack"" film that disappeared for so many long years. It was the one film of Dino's that I had never seen, so like many other fans, I looked forward to it! The film has some really fine action scenes and some top notch scenery (Bryce Canyon National Park), and the transfer here is crisp and colorful. Dean and Frank are clearly the stars here, and they do just fine. The shortcoming of the film, from my perspective, is that it can't quite seem to figure out whether it is a serious drama or a comedy. Nevertheless, I do recommend it. It's not ""Rio Bravo"", but it is fun."
5,So funny!,Sergeants 3 was a very funny movie. It had the Rat Pack in it. I wish more movies like this was made in this day and time.
2,Not what I expected,"This movie was dissapointing. I felt the movie was a waste of time for the likes of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop. It seemed the movie was just thrown together for a few laughs. The movie was a real dissapointment."
3,Good to remember !,"First of all I wish to point out the efficiency of Amazon, the order being received, abroad the US in only one week !!!A great movie in the tradition of J.Sturges 's movies (Magnificent 7, Great Escape...).One can feel how much the rat pack enjoyed acting together.The famous words of Dean Martin ""you are all arrested"" must be included in the legendary : C.Gable ""I don't give.."", De Niro ""you are talking to me ?"" and Dirty Harry ""make my day "".A ""MUST""in the library of a movies lover !"
5,The Rat Pack Out West,"The Rat Pack in a western that is -- of all things -- a remake of GUNGA DIN. It's fun, campy and light entertainment. It's a popcorn film and if you don't look further than that it is a pleasant romp."
1,Ugh,"One of the worst books I have read in many a day. Don't know how it ever got published. Just can't believe the story, characters and had a hard time getting into it."
5,Great classic game,The original BattleTech before they started getting carried away with a million different weapons and mechs. Simple to design your own mechs to try out also. All in all a great game that you can get into very quickly. All I'd suggest is something like HeavyMetal Pro (to print out mech sheets) to be able to setup quicker.
2,Too difficult for the beginner,"Though this is a nice little book with good photo illustrations of the postures/exercises and a nice introduction to chakras, these exercises are very difficult for a beginning student. I will try them further down the fitness road, much further!"
5,The Five Tibetans,"One of the best I've ever read, very easy to follow! I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to know more."
4,Had to have this book to get thorough instruction on these exercises.,"Great information, great book, wanted more information. Would definitely recommend it to anyone. Haven't done the exercises yet - but they look easy."
4,Excellent Book,"I only wish there were more demo photos, in color, showing better how to do each of the positions. The book could be updated for today."
5,benefits of the five tibetan rites,"I just received the Five Tibetan Rites program from a frinnd of my daughter on24.8.2002 and the guilines from the internrt .Till today ls the third week.To my suprise my arthritis pain on my back and side hip joint,back ribcage, leg joint pain with burning sentation have disappeared 90% by doing the FIVE RITES daily till today is the third week ,Iwas on pain killre and joint care medication for past 10 years, and also i have lost6lbin waight also, now i am able to walk faster and run now by following the gudlines from the FIVE TIBETAN RITES every morning i feel a nen positive anergy in me now i am age54nowTHANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE FIVE TIBETAN RITES EXERCISES"
5,"Excellent book, very succinct and practical.",This book is an excellent introduction to meditation as well as providing a series of exercises that are extremely stimulating for the body. I have felt a lot 'fitter' and stronger since starting these exercises. However I would appreciate someones comments; I have found that I am unable to do number 3 as it hurts my knees. Is anyone else finding troubles and where can you get further help?
5,The Five Tibetans,A must for every serious yoga student and yoga instructor. A detailed guide to five (5) great poses building strength and confidence and bringing balance into your life and practice.
5,Five Tibetans,"Being a yoga practitioner for 6 years now - I found this book to be an excellent resource for those who want a quick effective yoga workout - those who don't have the time to do an hour a day as I do. It is also good for when you travel as it requires no mats, blocks, blankets or any of the other props needed for most yoga regimes. Only thing I found disconcerting was the First Tibetan which made me naseuous. I have to assume this would subside with time. Well written and easy to follow. A simple but effective book."
1,Not The Original Recordings,"I don't care what ""Jill"" (up above) says, this CD contains one re-recorded song after another. To be quite frank, it's absolutely horrible, with Paycheck sounding as though he's on his last legs and singing the songs directly from the from the front lobby of a local nursing home -- for the drunken homeless. Don't buy this CD. I sure wish I hadn't. Let it die the quiet death it so richly deserves. Meanwhile, buy the ""SUPERHITS"" album instead, where you'll find the original recordings, just the way you remember them."
3,Best of Johnny Paycheck,"This is the old version of Johnny Paycheck's hit songs. Some of the songs on here are even older versions as well. There's only 10 tracks on here, but they're Outlaw Country classics like ""I'm the Only Hell my Mama Ever Raised"" a personal favorite of mine and ""Slide Off your Satin Sheets"".I bought it because the price was right, but the newer Johnny Paycheck hits compilation I recommend more as it has ALL of his great songs on one disc; especially if your a big fan of his music."
5,Johnny Paycheck at his usual best!,"This CD is great! Every single hit song on it! His sounds, his voice is great, his usual as he belt's out the lyrics in his own classic style! Being a child of the 70's with parents who fed me on country music, I'd say to anyone ""Buy this one! You won't be disappointed!"". A remake of his past hit's? I don't believe that one for a moment!"
1,Avoid this one like the plague,"I am a BIG fan of Mr. Paycheck, and his 'Greatest Hits' truely are great. This particular CD is one of those where they get the artist (usually country) to go back and re-record their songs, long after they can hit all the right notes. Even the cover of the CD is cheap: A b/w pic of Johnny colored ""Ted Turner"" style so bad he looks as if he's wearing blush.Go get his 16 Biggest Hits here instead...."
2,annoying accents,"I loved this cd the first time I listened to it. But after time, once I'd spent some time in Mexico and learned Spanish I began to find their accents really annoying. I'll give them credit for trying - I sure wouldn't record a CD in another language. And surely it's a blessing to people. But if you're looking for a good Spanish worship CD you can find much better. I am a fan of Delirious, by the way, I just think they should stick to English albums."
2,"Clasicos de Delirious, para los latinos","Soy un amante de la música de Delirious, me cautivo su sonido desde la primera vez que los escuche. En relación al CD ""Libertad"" creo que para nosotros los latinos resulta interesante escuchar algunas de esas canciones que hasta se entonan en nuestras iglesias, tal es el caso de la famosa ""Cantaré de su amor por siempre"" o que decir de ""Cantaría sin parar""Admiro y reconozco el esfuerzo que los D-boys realizaron al grabar este CD para el segmento latino, en mi muy personal y particular opinion siento que la traducción de algunos de los cantos se les dió un sentido distinto al que originalmente tienen en ingles, sin duda que se debe a los cambios del lenguaje que probablemente se debe a que no encajaban.Martin S., muchas gracias por tu esfuerzo pero prefiero seguirte escuchando en inglés, ojala sigas interesado en aprender mas de nuestro idioma y podamos escucharte con todo en una próxima producción en español"
3,Cautivante,"I actually read the spanish version. It's a very intriguing and well-narrated novel. Not McGrath best (Both Asylum and Spider are better. I believe that Grotesque would rate third after those two books). However, I found it very cautivating and interesting. McGrath shows his ability to suspense, his dark irony, and his gift for well constructed plots. A must read for McGrath fans, and a very good reading for anybody else. Nice place, also, for non-initiated to enter McGrath world. All the time I imagined a movie based in this novel and directed by David Lynch (or, maybe better, Hitchcock himself.)"
4,It made me fear paralysis and devious Butlers,"An exciting tale of murder betrayal and the shift of power within a manor. After the owner of the estate Hugo Cole is paralysized by a stroke he is forced to watch as his butler steals his wife and his daughters' fiancee is murdered. Combines the suspensful elements of a mystery with an undertone that could be described as comic. It has an eerie quality as we watch characters walk into horrible situations, that they themselves can't realize. After readin this book i'll think twice before getting a butler."
3,"Half Great, Half Lame","This is really two books in one. The white pages which depict the '93 team, and the gray pages which are stories about the Phanatic's exploits since 1978. The white pages are very, very good. There are lots of quotes from the major people involved, and the author does a great job of weaving them in with the story of the season. On the other hand, the gray pages are beyond worthless. I recommend this book, but just read the white pages. It serves as a reminder of what it means to have a baseball team to be proud of in Philly. The only downside is that as you read it, you will probably become angry at the current Philles roster. You'll catch yourself wondering...""why can't these guys play this way."""
5,Mind blowing,"Frankly I don't know about the other reviewer, but this is an incredible toy. More mind blowing that any toy I have owned. This is a must have ."
1,Let those who ride decide!,This book should be scorned and avoided! Accident avoidance not helmets save lives! Buy a book about improving your riding skills instead!
1,Personal safety is a concern of the individual not the state,"If a person wishes to risk personal injury without endangering others he should be allowed to. The freedom to choose was one of the founding principles of this country. Every law that is written ""for our own good"" chips away at everyone's right to decide what path his or her life will take. Continue to give up your right choose and the government will soon be deciding what you eat for breakfast -for your own good!"
5,Hallelujah,This was a gift for my loving husband. He was over joked by his newest cd. He listens to it often and is very happy it.
5,What a wonderful example of Christmas meaning,"I caught Sawyer Brown's Christmas show about a week ago and was taken by the music they played. During the intermission, my friend and I both bought copies of this disc. My previous SB experience was limited to Some Girls Do, but I found myself appreciating the music. It's a brilliant celebration of Christmas, both the joyful side and the reflective side. Mark Miller's soulful voice brings life to some Christmas classics, like Angels We Have Heard on High and The Little Drummer Boy, and he has also written some new material destined to be classics in my home. Of particular note is the arrangement of O Little Town of Bethelehem that closes out this disc. The new arrangement adds life to a song that I never particularly cared for. All in all, Hallelujah He is Born is a fine addition to anyone's Christmas collection, whether they be country, pop, Christian, or some other fan. Definate five star CD."
5,Contemporary Classic!,"I sought this album out after seeing the ""Hallelujah He Is Born"" video on TV--and am I glad I did! A wonderful country/rock album that's also a rare, unabashed celebration of a Christianity--distinctly not a secular album. Also, not a tired rehash of the same songs everyone has recorded. True, there are a few standards, but also new songs that range from rousing musical celebrations to reverential ballads. An absolute gem has been added to the Christmas musical lexicon. A MUST HAVE! Thank you, Sawyer Brown--and Merry Christmas!"
5,"com""YULE""ation cleric : my two cents too","Just how it should be done, a disc that is born with eight new songs brouhgt to life.""Wisdom is knowing what to seek"" and the those songs with other's words shine with new light.The mix invokes meaning and is truly beautiful in resting times.***** buy it and give it"
3,Look at packaging in options,"I have not yet tried the product, but after ordering a bottle of 240 capsules, I realized that the option for ""60"" was for 60 servings, or 240 capsules, and cost much less. Also, I am not sure how many capsules are in the 12 oz. bottle, so I couldn't say if this was a better deal."
3,Product good shipping slow.,"My wife has used this product for awhile. This last time she requested the 2-6 shipping. We got charged for it and still took 8 days. We have not been re-embursed. DONT USE the express shipping, what a waste."
3,Ok product,Product works as described but other products work as well and are cheaper. I most likely will not purchase again.
3,"Ok, but expected more.","Took the pills as required, however only the same effect I've gotten from xlax. Was truly hoping for a cleansing. I guess this just works for some people."
2,"It's okay, suppose to be used in a cleansing set","This product uses Senna, which when used overtime and too much can cause severe colon infractions in the gut, making it very uncomfortable. I've had some terrible experiences with deathly cramps and stabbing sensations in the gut from use of Senna; this isn't going to happen to everyone at any terms. It all comes down to rather the fact of how backed up you are and how healthy and staple your diet is.It's important to note the ingredients in this Cleansing product because there really are a lot of things to be aware of if you have any allergic tendencies.The Cleanse is suppose to be used with other products in a extended cleanse, which can be confusing as they aren't really listed on Amazon with the product, you might want to take a closer look if you were looking to pick the cleansing set up."
1,Not cleansing anything,"If taken as many as directed, product made me feel gassy and bloated then..nothing. Tried taking less for a longer period of time and it does nothing."
1,Buy otc fiber product instead,Did not get results any better than if I had used Miralax or Metamucil. I even get better from my fiber bars and they taste good!
1,Dietary Supplement Colon Cleanse,"I didn't like this product and ended up throwing it away. I took two of the capsules and became sick on the stomach. Because of that, I never gave it a chance to work because I wasn't able to take the amount I needed to take."
1,not so good,didn't work at all for me i didn't like it but for each it's own but it did come fast in the mail
3,don't take too many of them at the same time,"the label said to take 4 capsules, 2X day_ i only take 1 b4 each meal/snack- no more than 3 pills for the whole day- and it helps with bowel evacuation just fine----so please start with just a couple of pills and see how it works on you first- cause if you take 8 pills a day, you're gonna be running for the toilet and your neighbors will think you're playing the trumpet/tuba in your bathroom-"
2,Disappointment,Read all the hype about this product. But was very disappointed with the results. Felt it didn't do what i needed it to do
4,super colon cleanse,"I bought this product for the main purpose of cleansing. I find it is very good and starts working in no time. One of the many good things about it, (and my personal favorite), is that I don't get uncomfortable when I have the urge to use the bathroom. I have done many natural cleansers in the past and I have had the experience of being weakened and in gripping stomach pains when I had the urge to use the bathroom with other products.I have been using this along with another cleansing productNUTRAFLUSH PRO (3 Bottles) - The #1 Complete Colon Cleansing and Full Body Detox Cleanse Formula. The All Natural Diet, Weight Loss Cleansercombined with this is quite gentle on the system and yet fast acting. When I am feeling stopped up I use this product to help clear everything out. It has helped me feel a whole lot healthier. The only thing I would say with both of these products is that you will definitely see better results if you drink 8-10 glasses of water while you are using them."
3,Works as a laxative (although natural),"I would like to like this product, it always seem to have really high reviews everywhere, and I can get it at trusty and cheap ol' Trader Joes (grocery store). But unfortunately I cannot take it cause after 1-2 days I can't keep anything solid in my body. It contains something called Senna which works as a natural laxative. The dosage is pretty high, 4 capsules 3 times a day. I have tried taking half of that and it was still too potent. I think I might try their regular colon cleanse product which only contains Psyllium powder."
3,Cleanse Works But Causes Cramping,"This Colon Cleanse worked well for me, however it did seem to cause cramps after a week on it, & I only took it twice a day. Twice a day after a week seemed to much as I had a lot of cramps, so I went to once a day. After a month I discontinued it for awhile, I didn't like the cramping."
1,Waste of money,If you're looking for something to cleanse the colon then look elsewhere. As noted on the bottle this product is for people looking to add extra fiber to their diet. Taking 12 pills a day with extra iron is a waste and could be hazardous to your health. These pills did nothing for me and you're better off just taking fiber pills. Don't bother with this one.
2,Don't waste your money,"I was expecting to feel like new or something...not the case. This was nothing more that a bunch of fiber pills. It did make me go without cramps, but so do prunes."
1,"Didn't work for me,",This product did not work for me it all... It made me feel sick in my stomach. Not for me.
2,Lala,This product made me have really bad smelly gas! I was bloated for days so I stopped taking it.Lala
2,Yuck!,"I have the powder form of this colon cleanse, and yuck, it is terrible! It does not disolve in any liquid, even hot water. I tried masking it with Odwalla Superfood juice, but even that cannot hide the terrible dry taste of the powder. It's like eating dry fish food mixed with sand.On the other hand, it gets the job done...if you enjoy pooping a lot..."
3,good,"This product i use for long time, its good but dont use it much time, the best for use once a month."
5,WOW,It definitley gets you going. I didn't notice any effects until about 24 hours after I started taking the pills.
1,does not do what it states,"I been using this product for 1 week, it made me more consipated. really a waste of money. please don;t purchase this item, i don;t want to see someone else waste their hard earn money"
2,OK,I followed the directions for this product and it only worked for about 4 or 5 days. It mostly helped me make a few bowel movements without strain which is sometimes a problem for me. I wouldn't reorder this product for colon cleansing because I feel it just didn't work for that.
4,Great Colon Cleanse,"This was a great colon cleanse, I started off taking less than the recommended dosage because I thought it was too much. I took 6 a day instead of 12 a day. It took about 2 days to begin working. You can immediately tell that it is effective because the nature of the bowel movements. You can count on about 3-5 bowel movements a day. After each of them you feel a sense of freshness and relief like I've never felt, probably because it is removing old toxins from the body. There were even times when I felt very dizzy and feverish throughout the day, but I was told that that was a part of the detoxification process. what I was told to do was take it for a whole month, then wait another 2 months and do it once more.Great product, I highly recommend."
2,Not the best,"At 4 tabs twice a day, I could not tell they were doing anything. I have tried other products at retail, colon cleanse, and two tabs a day does the trick. I would not recommend this product. Go for the retail colon cleanse."
4,it works,it works grate for my.. the second day I use it start working well some times my stomach heart.. signal that you need to go... but is ok nothing bad.. I will recomended
4,Magic- for awhile,I have suffered from the worst constipation for years so I decided to try these. They worked AMAZINGLY well for a few years then they just stopped working and only made me gassy. Once they stopped working I went to a gastro doctor and he prescribed Amitiza which worked well (but not as well as these did) but now the prescription medication is not working so I'm going back to Colon Cleanse again.
3,Pros & Cons,"This product does exactly what it says. It cleanses your colon... Thoroughly. I didn't see much the first day, but the 2nd-5th day was stool after stool after stool. I was going every 10 minutes. It did make me feel a lot lighter and ""cleaned out"". DO NOT TAKE THIS PRODUCT EVERYDAY, as it is extremely dangerous for your health. While this is a good product, the taste is absolutely sickening. I tried it once and I had to drink it with hot water just to get it down, the capsules are tough and do not melt with saliva alone. They also don't go down easily, so I took the capsules apart and tried the powder and I almost threw up.(Hence the three stars). The taste gets an F-.. But the product alone gets an A+++.Super Colon Cleanse, Dietary Supplement, Good Source of Fiber, 240 capsules"
5,Great stuff,"Ive been using this product for about 2 years now and can safely say its a great product. Wonderful way to clean out your system effectively and remove any bloat you may be suffering from. Ive used it in conjunction with my own weight loss efforts to control my weight and keep it at the proper level. Great product, buy and use accordingly and you will get desired results..."
1,meh,"I can't say that this helped me in any way, and it's absolutely disgusting. That's about all I can say. :)"
4,This is not my favourite LeAnn Rimes album,"LeAnn Rimes is capable of better works.For those who are fortunate to have th ""All That"" album, then maybe this one isn't good, and certainly for others who don't have ""All That"", it isn't that good.LeAnn re-recorded most of the tracks she did for ""All That"". Her yodelling is good in ""I Want to Be A Cowboys Sweetheart"", the acapella portion of ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"" and the song itself is fabulous, the song she wrote ""Share My Love"" is a great ballad that is fast and catchy. In ""Broken Wing"", she sings beautifully and that rendition is extremely heartfelt. I didn't like ""I Will Always Love You"" and ""Yesterday"". They are classics that she should have left out. They are good songs but they seemed out of place in this album. ""Unchained Melody"", the Grand Finalé is performed excellently.This album is a good one, but isn't her best."
4,This album shows off her voice,"After listening to this album, you could tell that it was designed to show off her voice, not the quality of the material. The songs are all remakes anyway. Obviously, she has the strongest and most confident voice in country today. She gladly shows off her versatile vocal ability with ""I Will Always Love You"" and ""Unchained Melody."" But aside from that, these songs do not convey emotion, or any type of depth whatsoever. This album is all about showcasing LeAnn's voice. Oh well. I suppose that's why it was released in the first place. By the way, the best song is ""Unchained Melody."" It's much smoother and more flowing than The Righteous Brothers' (Were they the ones who sang it?) version. It's a wonderful song to listen to over and over, plus you can hear LeAnn reach the hightest note I've ever heard from a country singer. She also shows just how long she can sing before having to pause to take a breath. Wow, what a song."
5,Wonderfully amazing!,"I love this album because it shows LeAnn's growing voice through her singing years. In ""Cowboy's Sweetheart"" it shows off LeAnn's yodel. She sings ""Broken Wing"" and ""Unchained Melody"" beautiful. It was a #1 chart success, and it's a great CD!"
5,LeAnn Rimes Rules!,This Album proves LeAnn had such a great voice even almost 4 years ago. I am LeAnn Rimes Biggest Fan. This album is the Best!
2,LeAnn Rimes's unchained melody,"I was very disappointed with this album. It wasn't as good as it should have been. I realize that it was something that was made before she hit the big time, and there is a reason for it.IT should have been kept a secret."
4,I can understand it.,"After the huge success LeAnn had with Blue, she released an album recorded pior to Blue. This I can kind of understand. It's remarkable that she was only 11 or 12 years old when she did this! This also goes to prove that she has worked hard to get where she is today. Although, there are a couple of songs that she doesn't do well. The opening ""Cowboy's Sweetheart"" shows that her yoddling has come a long way. (It's almost annoying to listen to. Thank God she's improved!) ""Share My Love"" which she wrote sounds like it came fresh from eighties rock and doesn't work. But she does a great job with ""I Will Always Love You"" and ""Unchained Melody."" Hopefully, Unchained Melody and Blue will canapault her into becoming a legend."
3,"Much better than ""Inspirational Songs"" but.....",".....this collection of done-to-death songs is little more than an attempt to cash in on LeAnn's fame. Unless you're a hardcore LeAnn fan, this CD is really a waste of time and money. Her voice, with its tremendous range and potential, is charming on ""I Will Always Love You"" and ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"" but the more mature ""Blue"" is still her best recording to date."
4,Comforting,"The ""rainy season"" analogy starts at the beginning of the book and continues through the epilogue. In essence she describes two major trials in her life, illness and her daughter's marriage breakup, and discusses what she has learned spiritually through those difficulties. On page 136 she observes ""Whatever your walk in life, and whatever the trouble that may be filling your cup right now, God is still in the process of doing an amazing work in your life."" She points out that this book is not about comparing troublesome stories with other people and she acknowledges that other people have faced more severe circumstances, she says the point is to point people to the comfort God can and will provide as they seek Him."
3,Peasant Radicalization and Social Change in Bicol,"This short work describes the implementation and effects of the National Democratic Front (NDF) agrarian reform program in a village in Bicol, the Philippines. It begins with a description of rural society and the history of attempts at land reform throughout the Philippines. It then describes the NDF reform programme in general and goes on to discuss its implementation in the community in detail. Garcia Padilla is clearly an NDF partisan, is unclear about his sources, and has a slightly faulty grasp of English - Agrarian Revolution is not a great scholarly work. Given the limited amount of information available about areas under New Peoples' Army control, however, it will be of interest to anyone concerned with land reform in the Philippines."
5,excellent,really enjoyed this book. It reminded me of the spellsinger stories and the mis-matched friendship between Mudge and Jon-Tom. I loved the story.
4,an episodic smorgasbord of imaginative creatures and events,"I found this novel to be a pleasant, highly enjoyable reading experience. The episodic structure seemed almost to hark back to children's fairy tales, and so, like a child, I truly enjoyed Foster's imaginative creatures and situations. However, while the journey of Etjole itself is certainly a plot device, the novel did seem to lack a definitive story arc. This may be due to the fact that it is the first of a series. I have never read any of Foster's work previously, but I am looking forward to reading the rest of this series. Very charming and escapist literature."
2,Carnivores = A Dog of a Book (Woof),"Let's see. I have a 3 book deal, so let's start with an interesting beginning and then send my hero on a VERY, VERY LONG journey. My hero really has no idea where he is going (NORTH!). Between the beginning of this book and the end of the third book, let's put everything I can think of into it to fill up the pages and get this series up to the 3 books I promised.My problem with this book and the next one, Into the Thinking Kingdoms, is that what happens is not really relevant to advancing the original premise, it's just filler material. It reads more like a series of short stories or folk tales, none of them particularly compelling. I know its tough to hit a home run every time at the plate, but this one is pretty lightweight compared to most."
3,talk to the animals,"The first science fiction novel I ever read was Foster's Tar-Aiym Krang when I was twelve. Perhaps because it was such a momentous and important event in my life, I've never given up on ADF. Sure the plots are simplistic and perhaps a bit too bubbly. And I'm sure that it's been said that his characters tend to be a tad bit under-dimensional. I don't care... the entertainment value of an Alan Dean Foster book is consistent and reliable. I mean, if I want a mind-blowing experience, I can wait for a Stephen R. Donaldson or Neal Stephenson novel. But in the meantime, I don't mind following the adventures of a smelly shepherd who can talk to monkeys and ants..."
3,A Decent Game Pad,"This Saitek controller is certainly a solid gamepad. The directional controller is a bit awkward, but you can get used to it. The action buttons are also a bit too stiff -- This pad is a decent deal for ten bucks, but the Interact Piranha is an overall better design (and cheaper)."
4,The right price,"I got this pad because it was cheap, it had the four buttons that I needed, and it was ergonomic. My hands are always very comfortable holding this controller, even when I've been gaming for the last few hours. The directional pad is very unique. There is a circular attachment that fits in the bottom of the controller to give you a standard d-pad. You can take this attachment out and plug it in to the center of the d-pad, making the d-pad higher and more like a joystick (as shown in the picture of the controller). I play with it almost exclusively like this. I haven't been able to use the triggers in the current EA Sports games that I've been playing, so count on four buttons. If you are looking for more options (buttons) in your games, I highly recommend upgrading to the six-button Microsoft USB Sidewinder Pro."
1,Uggg-Leeee.,"A friend gave me something like this he found in the trash, I can see why it was put there. Not enough buttons to be useful and that D-pad is crap, its a D-pad that tries to be analog. If you want true console ruggedness for your PC games and emulators, get a Lik-Sang ""Smart Joy"" adapter and dig your old standard or aftermarket PS1/PS2 pad out of the closet. Download Joy2Key and you'll have keyboard and mouse mapping software that's better than any Saitek or Logitech's mapping software."
2,Glorified phrasebook with some grammar lessons thrown in.,"I agree with a previous reviewer gracejoy7. This course is little more than a glorified phrasebook with an all German CD accompaniment. Repetition/memorization may work for some, but there is no true learning of the language. Too many lessons focus just on adding new vocabulary or phrases, with very little explanation of the grammar or helpful historical/cultural notes. Conversations (or some semblance thereof) start at about lesson 33 out of 40, way too late. For the cost (about [$$$]) I suppose you get what you pay for, but I understand the Teach Yourself German (NTC series) is a better deal. If you just want a phrasebook and CD for a trip perhaps the Berlitz German CD pack or Fodor's German for Travelers would be a better deal."
1,A complete and utter waste of money,This is half-hearted attempt at making a foreign-language program. Spare your money for this and buy something else. Smart Start German is a CD ROM/audio CD/cassette package for sale in the Software store that also includes a workbook--this is a much better all-around program for German. Skip this one.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I have has this scale for 2 weeks now and it is horribly inaccurate. It is off up to 3 pounds. There is a button to ""tare"" the weight, hold the current weight, or turn the machine on. When you press the button, all is does is hold the current weight. When you do finally tare the weight, 9 times out of 10 it will not go to 0.0. It will go to 1.2 or higher. If I could give this no stars I would. It is a piece of junk!!!!!"
4,Very Happy,Good price and only the funcions I need. Easy to use and reliable. Perfect for my needs. I would recommend this product to anyone with a small office who does not do regular bulk mailings but occasionally needs to know the weight of something to calculate correct postage on the USPS website.
1,Waste of money,"Like some other reviewers, I purchased this exact scale off ebay and it's been a problem since day 1. It's temperamental. It doesn't work if the room is less than 73 degrees. And even when it is, I have to cross my fingers and hope that it will work just long enough to weigh my package. And usually it doesn't. Fresh batteries or not.I'd like to think that my problems with this scale were a fluke, however I know this not to be true since my mother also owns this same piece of junk and she also has had problems with it since day 1. So, here I am, looking for another scale to buy.Save yourself the trouble and just click on through the other scale options on Amazon. Or you'll find yourself right back here like me."
4,Good scale,This scale is easy to use and it shipped very quickly. I can either use it with the power cord or with batteries.
5,Great!,"This is a great and accurate scale! The first time I used it, I took my items to the PO to be sure it was accurate~It IS!Now I save soo much time, just weighing my Ebay items and shipping them from home. I should have ordered one ages ago, it is a great time-saver! Thank You!"
3,Not as black as I expected.,"I used this one time, and it made my dark blond hair a very light brown. I applied more the next day, and let it sit in for an hour. (Usually 1/2 an hour gets desired results) It made my hair a muted brown. I wouldn't expect it to be that color unless it was washed about 5 times. I was really hoping for the blackest black, or at the very least a natural black, but I just ended up with darker hair. None of the other colors give me this problem. I figured that black would be the last color to do that considering there is no darker shade."
5,Awesome!,"This stuff is great! My hair had been pretty dry from dying it so many times previously, but after using Manic Panic Raven hair dye it was soft and silky smooth again. Also, it's a great color."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought 2 of these books for my 8 and 10 year old daughters based on the 3 prior reviews. They both love art and were not impressed by this book, neither was I. Most of the mandalas are very simplistic so if you want to color anything intricate, then you have to add lines, circles, etc, to the existing designs. Your own kids can probably make their own mandalas to color which will be just as good, or better than the ones in this book. If I had paid only $4.95 or so for this book, then I would up the stars to 3. Don't buy it."
5,For those who don't know...,"In reality there were only a few lucky souls during this time period that really got to experience the Seattle soul scene. While a lot of other people were trending towards disco and straight ahead rock, the real people who knew and appreciated music were catching these acts at their local obscure clubs. Even the DJ who essentially hosts this DVD who has hundreds of thousands of LPs, and 45's never heard of these bands. That kind of sums it up. Anyway, loved this DVD. Wish there were videos of live performances back in the day...but back then, I barely had pictures of my own bands I played in, let alone pictures of these bands. There were many, many Seattle soul bands other than what is just presented here. The originators of this DVD need to dig deeper and come up with a second edition. That would be great!"
5,Fantastic,"The music is full of feeling, soul and funk. It makes you want to move. This is a fantastic piece of work!"
1,pretty silly even for a fantasy romance:(,"Well, I quit this one 60 pages in. The heroine is:a)pretty uppity and a stickler for ""society's conventions"", weird since that same society wasn't giving her any breaks-they cannot believe she drew the pictures in her dead husbands flower book, but the heroine loves to judge all those around her as being too ""base"" or ""course""b)the ""empathic"" relationship she has with plant life is written very silly and over the top-for example, she cannot stand Dublin because of the ""pain"" the plants growing in ditches have????if you find yourself wincing at a book 60 pages into 400-than, in my opinion, it's time to relagate to the used book stack and go to another book.half a star:("
3,this soundtrack was incomplete,"My parents had this on vinyl when I was very young. And then it dissappeared , My mom gave me the record when I was six so I remember the music alot. when they released this on cd I bought it almost immediately , only to discover that it only contained half on the songs from the record , and half of from the soundtrack album of another version of a ""Wild Angels"" score (I believe it was called more songs from the movie), and now this cd is also out of print. So why did they even bother?"
1,Where is the Loser???,"I've been wanting this for years only to find out they shorted me the Losers theme, which starts out with the coolest drum solo ever played. It's the part where Loser steals the cops' bike and gets shot. How could these idiots leave it out? I read the the selections and thought they had changed the name. No wonder everybody is selling these things used. What a rip off!!!!"
2,Not what I expected,"There is a long story behind why I loved this album back in the 60's, which I am not going to get into right now. Suffice to say that I played that vinyl record 40 years ago every day for a very long long time. The new CD version was very dissapointing. It sounds ""too modern"". There are songs that weren't in the originl vynil edition, which I wouldn't mind. But what irked me was that there were others in the original that are missing here. Can't remember the names after so many years, but I clearly remember a song with a bongo solo that is not in the CD version, and that happens to be one of my favorites."
5,Awsome Ending,I just recently finished this book and I think it is a great book. The ending is what you least except.
5,This book was great ! a real page turner!,This was one of the best books that I ever read. Great detailing and you are always left in suspense! I suggest this book to any young adult who likes a good thriller.A book written in the eyes of a KILLER!
5,An amazing thriller,Blindfolded is a wonderfully written thriller about a long lost secret burried in the basement of an old courthouse where she used to play as a child. This book keeps you on your toes with the romance adventure and mystery. You could only imagine exactly who's secret is uncovered.
2,One writer or two?,"Did Fern Michaels get bored with the story and pay someone else to finish the book for her? The style of writing changed towards the end of the story. The plot and characters started out with real depth and meaning and held my attention; however, after Casey ended up with Alan it was as though the writer was 'standing back' and watching, and not really into the main characters anymore.I was extremely disappointed with this novel."
1,THREW THIS ACROSS THE ROOM!,"***SPOILERS***I don't think I've ever been so upset after reading a book. I can take all kinds of emotional upheaval and tragedy in novels, however - I expect any romance novel I read to at least have a happy ending!This book was just one tragedy, heartache, pain, anguish filled moment after another. It was like torture. I kept reading, waiting for the relief of the main characters love to bring them together in the end.DIDN'T HAPPEN. OH MY GOSH it didn't happen!!! After slogging through all the pain and horrible, awful circumstances, they still love each other but don't get together?!I'm royally ticked off. I've always liked Fern Michaels, but this one makes me feel betrayed as a reader.UGH."
3,Fast read!,This book is not as good as her Kentucky or Texas series. I had the outcome figured out pretty quickly. It is a quick read though and fairly interesting.
5,amazing book,"This must be my favourite book ever, ever, ever.The characters were all well developed and real to me, and although I know little about the war it all seemed realistic enough.Brilliant story with a very poignant ending ... I still get a lump in my throat thinking about it!!I enjoyed reading this book so much I just never wanted it to end. I'm sure it's out of print here in the UK now, but thankfully I found a copy to keep and read again whenever the mood comes over me.Brilliant!"
2,Let Down,"I read the back of this book and thought, this sounds so wonderful. Started reading it, enjoyed it, didn't think the writing style was one that I would love to keep reading. It wasn't the best written book, it wasn't the worst. I was interested in the story, the romance. I hated the ending of the book and when I finished it, the ending made me hate the entire book! Now I can't get it out of my head and I need to pick up another book so I can stop thinking about it!!"
4,This book left me heart-broken.,"I enjoyed reading this book even though it was a bit long at times. I liked the way the author brought out the emotions felt by Vietnam Vets after they returned home from the war but, I would have preferred for her to be a little more descriptive. I didn't really feel like I was there... smelling, feeling, and hearing what our soldiers and medical personnel did while they were ""in country."" My heart actually ached for Mac and Casey, wishing their love affair had materialized into much more. Overall, this book was good reading."
4,Still not sure about this book,"Mac and Casey,I don't see all those mixups happening.First she would have given her address if she was going out with him again. Then even i don't like affairs but i would have understood his story if he had told, she would have too. then to have them keep missing each other. I felt so sorry for them, but i still can't see them maried to two other people still loving each other that is worse then an affair. I liked that he found his real father in the end, but to have her go thur all that pain and hurt and never get him. No i did not like the ending al all. This is the second one i didn't like the ending Serendipity was the other one. so next time have them get together .Alice and Luke should have gotten together."
5,Bog Owl is Awesome!,"So many new christian fiction books coming out, but there never is anything of quality for young people,,,until now. If you're kids are hooked on Harry Potter then you've got to get them to try this book. Its very well written, and so imaginative. I especially like the ""swampy"" setting, gators and all. I give this my highest recommendation!"
4,Enjoyable new edition to the realm of children's fantasy...,"This book was on the new release shelf in my library and was in no way classified as a children's book or Christian literature. I picked it up because the jacket mentioned that the fictional kingdom of Corenwald resembled Georgia. I was curious to see what southern fantasy would be like.As I started to read, I quickly realized that this book was written for younger children because the plot was a bit simplistic. Despite this fact, I greatly enjoyed reading all about Aidan's adventures because of how vividly the tale was told.Besides plot parallels between this story and the Biblical narrative of David and Goliath, this book is not really very religious. It would probably be enjoyed by anyone who loves children's fantasy."
5,Perfection ! ! !,"Exquisite voices, beautiful calming music ! I love to hear them sing, its amazing and beautiful :) I will buy more of their CDs for sure ! If you like Enya or Sarah Brightman, you will love this music !"
1,"Cynical, sentimental, saccharin slush","This was playing in the 'Classical' section of my local record store. After 5 minutes I felt somewhat annoyed. 10 minutes, nauseous. 15 minutes, I wanted to leave or vomit. This is an album for people who don't really like classical music, only gorgeous melodies and lovely boys' voices... the musical equivalent of pictures of kittens taken through smeared lenses.You can hear where the composer got most of his ideas from (such as they are) if you get recordings of masterpieces such as Faure's Requiem, Lotti's Crucifixus, Pergolesi's Stabat Mater, the Allegri Miserere... that is, if you can bear to give up the synthesized accompaniments, artificial reverberation and computerized drum tracks and listen to live, breathing, thinking musicians providing the lower parts instead.The worst thing about it is that the boys really do have beautiful voices. Too bad that they are known only for this pre-digested pap."
4,wonderful and enlightening,I first heard of this choir group in a you tube video. It was beautiful. Something I had to have. Good thing Amazon had it. The CD is great for meditation and its very peaceful. Enjoy! K.Borges
1,DONT BUY THERE PRODUCT!,There attache 4GB USB drive is a piece of KRAP!Not able to write to it now its read only and not repairableBEWARE surf the net for reviews!
4,GB to Go.,"Nice product, but yeah, you'll eventually (I haven't yet...) lose the gray cap to the male connector...but who doesn't lose that kind of stuff? (pen caps, etc...) Otherwise, a pretty good USB drive so far. Give me some files!"
1,"Extremely Slow, Cap Falls Off Easily","This flash drive reads and writes so slowly that having 2GB pretty much means nothing. It takes nearly 30 seconds for any PC to even recognize it has been connected (and I tried it on 3 different PCs), and it takes much, much longer than it should to copy a simple 2-3MB file. If you intend to use this flash drive to quickly transfer files of any meaningful size you will be greatly disappointed.Also, the cap falls off quite easily. I have the loop attached to my key ring, and it often comes off while in my pocket.I'm going back to SanDisk. So much for trying to save a few bucks."
4,Exactly what I Needed,"It may look cheap and may be off brand, but it works excellently. I needed a USB drive for school with a decent amount of memory. With this one, I got much more than I needed at a great price. I figured that I'll use it in the future."
4,GREAT!,"I have to say that this is probably the best investment I have ever made! It is very handy---just attach it to your keychain and voila---instant memory! The only reason that I gave it a 4 rather than a five is the fact that if you're not careful, you can acutally pull the body off of the flash memory. This actually happened to me, but I super-glued the piece back on and it's been fine ever since..."
4,Great lil drive,"Works great, had one of my own, and got some for gifts. These lil things work great. Only con: the grey part you see is acutally a cover for the orange unit. So while you are taking off the grey cover to plug it into the PC, you may end up pulling off both grey things...or back end."
2,Not well supported,"This is a fine drive as long as you don't run into problems with it, or need to updated a driver.The driver wasn't recognized on one of my computers, so I went looking for another one. First, it's next to impossible to find anything on their site. Then their troubleshooting procedure is ridiculously complicated. I finally gave up. I'll use one of my other sticks and never buy one of these again.If you get one, and you don't have an IT staff around to help you, pray you don't need a new driver.M|S"
4,just good old file storage without Vista booster or U3 software,"I was looking for just a plain file download device without unwanted ""extras"" [using a U3-enabled device will cause Windows to reboot - not a good experience on a public computer]. This may not be the swiftest solid state memory, but it's far faster than the download speed of a broadband internet connection. The price is right and construction is solid.[NOTE: preformatted for FAT; easily reformatted to FAT-32 (but not NTFS); presumably reformattable to Apple OS too]"
1,Very Week Casing,I have hardly used the thing ( bought it a couple of weeks ago) I carry it in a case and the little silver has already broken.
5,Flash Drive,"This thing is terrific. I'm a writer with 18 chapters of a novel-in-progress and a number of short stories saved on my computer. When the computer began misbehaving, I quickly backed up all my documents--because my hard drive will probably have to be wiped. Hurray for my PNR 2 gig attache!"
3,Monster Truck Bloopers 3,"I guess if you're a monster truck fan it's okay but part 1,2,3 are all the same video with basically the same footage. Not really a ""must have""."
1,Can't hold charge after few months,"I was very disappointed when after only a few months, the battery could not hold a charge for more than a couple of pictures - - without even using the flash. So, essentially, the useful life of this product is a few months at most. Oh, and I did charge and recharge the battery properly..."
2,Doesn't Last,I got this battery as a spare from Battery Barn. It lasted only about half the time of the original Panasonic battery.
2,Disappointed...,"I was a bit disappointed with this book! I found the first few chapters helpful, but the rest of it I skipped over, as it was just filled with shopping lists for things to eat (and practically anything you might eat is an aphrodisiac or offers some benefit when you're planning a baby, it seems!) and ""spells"" you can cast to increase your odds. I also found the tone of the book to be a bit demeaning, like this is the first time you are having sex and you don't know how a man's body works when he gets aroused! Not to mention, every other sentence ends with a exclamation point! Isn't that annoying?! I don't have a recommendation for something better as this is the first I've read, but I would recommend looking elsewhere if you want solid information to help you prepare for a baby."
3,Okay book,"This book was not what I had originally thought it was going to be about. It has a lot of alternative medicine stuff in it, which isn't bad but not what I was looking for."
4,great deal and it sure beats arrows,I was scared when I first got it because I thought it was bad. It is just more sensitive than thought. Now that I have said this you are not so sure about it anymore. love it it could not be much better. I bought this because I like driving at the arcade and this is just about as good besides the othe extras at the arcade. It is a lot of fun. I have had it for about a month and I still play it almost every day. It is a good match with Need for speed: High Stakes
2,Good But Made Cheeply,"This game controllor is very delicut! I wouldn't sugest this controller to some one who is into F1, Nascar, and Need for speed racing games. How ever if you like driving games like Drivers Ed, and The Worlds #1 Truck Driving school this is the right cntrollor for you.For F1, Nascar, and Need For Speed racing games I would defenently recomend the Thrustmaster Made by Fororri. It is by fare the best coputer game of the year!"
5,I feel like I'm on the road!,"Easy installation, and easy to hook on to the desk. It doesn't slide at all if I screw it in tight enough, and the pedals don't slide either, since they're on a carpet. Even if the pedals weren't on a carpet, I don't think they would slide much, since there are these grooves under them that provide friction. It's NOT a USB wheel. I use this wheel with ""Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit"" and it works great. It's really easy to slam on the brakes, or to make a sharp turn. The only thing missing from this is Force Feedback, but at 30 bucks, who cares? I may be a cheapskate, but 30 bucks is DEFINITELY an awesome deal! One more thing: in the installation, it says to uninstall all other non-USB gamepads. You don't need to do that. Just click the ""advanced"" tab in the game controller window (that's in ""control panel"") and set the ID # of the steering wheel to 1 (first setting the ID of the original ""#1"" to something else, like #3.)"
3,Eric Carle Book - Quiet Cricket,"This was a very nice book; however, I purchased two of them and one did not make noise. I assume it was the battery, just have not checked as of yet.The book itself is very cute and loved it. Just wish they both would have worked for my granddaughter and niece."
5,Make this book even better with hand motions,"My mother gave our daughter this book was she was about 4 months old. At first she showed no interest. I am a huge fan of Eric Carle's books and was so disappointed. Yet, I continued to periodically read this book to her. It wasn't until I added the hand motion of rubbing my hands together when it said ""the little cricket rubbed his wings together. . ."" that my daughter (now 9 months) took notice of the book. Soon she was mimicking and rubbing her hands together. Of course, she loves turning to the last page and hearing the sound of the cricket. Now this book is one of her favorites."
3,Defective,Hardcover books (I had mine replaced and received another defective one) do not make the chirping sound at the end.
5,Love this book!,The book is a great book as the kids can hear the cricket at the end of the book. I highly recommend this book for any child. I am very pleased with my purchase and would order again!
2,Batteries worn out,Certainly there is nothing wrong with this classic book. There is a wonderful surprise at the end of the book requiring batteries that didn't work. When we replaced the batteries the contact would you shut off when the book was closed so it was easy to see how the batteries that came with the book didn't work. Was really glad there was time to replace the book in time for gift giving. The return with Amazon went very smoothly.
4,"Great Illustrations & Story, but...","My 8 1/2 month old is fascinated by the wonderful artwork and the chirping sound. I expect he'll enjoy the story when he can understand the words. However, there's an inconsistency in the text that drives me crazy. The three crickets are referred to as ""he"" and ""she,"" but the praying mantis and worm are referred to as ""it."" Argh!"
5,My Classroom Loves It!,My students just love this book. They enjoy my reading it to them and they like to look at it. They are 3 yrs. old and can hardly wait for the last page so they can hear the cricket.
3,disappointed,"I am very familiar with Eric Carle's books because my kid loved his book at young age, and I love them too. I was ordering it for my friend's young kid; however, to my surprise it was not the broad, hard pages like used to be. Instead the pages inside are thin papers, and the size is way too big. Maybe I didn't read carefully about the dimension of the book. But anyway, it is not what I expected, and the original version is much better in terms of size and inside pages."
2,Please make the chirp stop,This is a favorite of my family. It was a favorite of mine until the chirping would not turn off. The book was closed and the chirp was still chirping all night I was to tired to search for the book at first but after 10 mins I could take no more. It is a really cute story and we love the chirp but I had to take the batteries out. If my daughter wants to me to read this one to her I have to hold the batteries and put them in when she gets to the last page. Hope this helps someone else before buying the book we love Carle but I would pass on this one.
1,not worth it!,"I have ordered two of these and one didn't ""chirp"" and the other's cover was all bent up.It is a cute story, but borrow it from the library and buy another Eric Carl book instead!"
1,Battery died right away,"Bought this for a friend because it sounded great at the store. Once I got it home, the cricket barely made any noise at all! Disappointing."
5,Masterful and Magical story telling by Eric Carle,"I read the book the Very Quiet Cricket upon the prodding of my sister who happens to be a pre-school teacher. She was preparing several synopses on Eric Carle books which would be printed in the programme of her school's forthcoming Reading Recital. My sister asked me to help her write the synopsis to this book as well as 3 other books. Eric Carle's storytelling in the Very Quiet Cricket caught my curiosity as different insects interacted with our hero page after colorful page. The story ended in a way which delighted me and gave me such respect for the lowly cricket. I discovered a beautiful love story in the book, a story of how awesome nature really is. For me, the chirping sound in the last page really became ""the most beautiful sound I had ever heard""."
3,Love Eric Carle but...,"this isn't a favorite of mine. The Very Hungry Caterpillar is better. The cricket's story isn't as interesting to the children I've worked with as the caterpillar's. The illustrations are vintage Carle - we all did love the pictures. And I like that he introduces new vocabulary for children, and the use of repitition is still there. Some of the bug names were even hard for a few of the adults, however. Overall, I'd say check this out from the library if your child is a fan of Carle's work and has already read The Very Busy Spider and The Very Hungry Caterpillar. If they love it, then you can think about buying it."
3,Not Quite Hitting the Mark,"First, my children live for Eric Carle's ""Very Busy Spider"". The author seems to use the same formula for ""The Very Quiet Cricket"". This book misses the mark with my kids however. The bugs he chooses for his book are a bit difficult to say. Although the repetition is there to help the child learn how to read on his/her own, the various ways of saying hello doesn't seem to replace the fun of repeating animal noises. Take this one out of the library. I wouldn't purchase for your collection."
2,Not a Very Good Book,"I can't recommend this book. It seemed sloppily written and edited, with numerous errors. The fact that the author largely limits himself to Euclidean spaces may or may not, depending on your needs, be a big drawback, but the carelessness of the writing really detracts from its usefulness."
2,Not Great For Point-Set Topology,"This book was required for the class I did in undergraduate topology. I didn't like this book at all. I can not highly recommend it's use as a class text, perhaps as a reference book. There are much better books on general topology out there."
3,It's from Jump Fiesta... it wasn't lost...,"People don't seem to know what this is, I don't think there really is such a thing as a 'lost episode'. This 40 minute episode is really just a video which was only shown at a special Japanese event called Jump Fiesta. This was never, and probably will never, be shown on TV, as it is not part of the Naruto saga really. You should be happy that something only shown at Japans exclusive Jump Fiesta screenings is dubbed and released so people who don't know Japanese or live in Japan can watch it!The episode/movie/OVA isn't really that exciting though. It's not terrible, but the jokes weren't particularly funny and it was all predictable. I'm happy it was released in Australia with a bonus Jump Fiesta short ""Naruto: Find the Crimson Four-Leaf Clover!"" :) It was slightly better than this waterfall one."
3,Naruto Lost Story,I bought this item a little while ago and haven't watched it since. It's plot strays from the main plot of the series. It also took to long for it to get moving and it seemed like the battles dragged on and on. But there were a couple parts where I laughed pretty hard. It's worth the money but don't expect anything too great. 3 out of 5 stars!
1,The one that should have stayed lost,"Ok this one might just just be one of the worst Naruto movies ever. No Kakashi, no 9 Tailed Fox, no sharigan. Just some stupid water. So yeah basically this was a waste of time."
2,I saw this on T.V,"I saw this in T.V (The 'Lost story) and it wasn't very good. It had a few laugh out loud moments, but other thne that it was very boring. Don't buy this movie. It was trash. It should of stayed lost."
4,A True Naruto Fan's Review,"This dvd should be considered a mini-movie. It exsists outside of the series story arcs. I think this a fun and dramatic story within the Naruto universe. This dvd contains both the english televised version and the uncut original with japanese audio, which is always a pluse for me. Any true Naruto fan would find this dvd to be a must have."
3,"Not the best story for Naruto fans, but not the worst either","Though it fell a little short of my expectations, it might have been better if it was released to the American market at an earlier date, I did like the DVD much better than when it aired on Cartoon Network and would recommend that Fans of the show add this disc to their collection.For those looking for answers to certain questions raised during the show this doesn't have any. It also doesn't build on any other story lines the show has produced.What this OVA does offer is another adventure showing Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura using their skills in ways that have become common. Apparently this takes place sometime after the third Hokage dies, but there is no mention of his death."
2,It should have stayed lost,"I am a Naruto fan somewhat, and I had high hopes for this. However, it fell short of my expectations. The story is about Naruto and the rest of his team escorting a cowardly leader named Shibuki to his village, but things get mixed up when an old enemy named Suien appears in the village and tries to steal it's treasure, the Hero's Water. While this may seem exciting, it's actually quite boring once you actually watch it. Naruto and Shibuki talk for an extended period of time, which takes out a lot. So far, this is bad. Very bad.I won't spoil anything, but if you're a Sakura fan, don't buy this. She's tied up half the time. While the fight scenes are at least decent to good, they don't last long enough to hold your attention for very long, Thus comes to the conclusion of my review. It may seem good to some people, but to most, it's just some practical joke created for a good series. A very bad pratical joke."
4,Presto 07050 Cool-Touch,"This is a fine griddle, much better than the B&D that it replaced. My biggest concern was how even it would cook, it is not perfect, but they did a good job of getting it close to even. pancakes are probably the toughest and they come out slightly uneven in color, but OK. Price was competitive."
4,Really like this thing.,"I have had mine for several months now, and it is a lifesaver! I was trying to make bunches of French toast in a large, round skillet, and it took forever. I now can make 6 slices at a time. It heats up very quickly as far as I am concerned, and I can have a dozen pieces done in a very short time. (I don't use milk in my French toast, only a little salt and a few drops of vanilla - I use real butter to cook them - All the kids around think mine are great!) I think not using milk makes them cook quicker, too. It does have some spots that cook a little quicker than others, but this really is not a problem for me. One reviewer said that it still took up a lot of space even with the legs folded down - well, the thing is large, but that is part of its appeal - you can cook more items at one time. You just can't have your cake and eat it too, I guess!"
2,Uneven Heat Distribution,"No matter how long you preheat it, the edges are hotter than the center area. I could even see the ""burner line"" in my pancakes; kinda like an L shape from the corner of the griddle. Middle area heats up perfectly even. But I'm not going to make one pancake at a time on a 15"" griddle. Don't get me wrong, the outer ones were edible, and if you have a big family and need to cook tons of stuff at a time, then this might be for you. But for me, I think I'll try and find another one that heats up more evenly, if that's even possible. One of the comments on one of the other reviews here said the edges were up to 100 hotter than the center. I believe him. Maybe they should re-design this where there are 8 or 9 thinner heating element tubes distributed evenly under the surface instead of one big one going around the outer edge."
3,Good but non-stick surface did not last,"Pretty decent griddle but the non-stick surface did not last. Didn't really chip off, but over time it degraded and I'm sure my family and I ingested some of it - thanks Presto! The fold away feature is nice and cooks well."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have purchased several cd-rom educational sets for my now 6 year old and this is among the worst. It was especially disappointing because three of the four cds that came with their preschool-1st grade series were really good. In this series, two of the cds won't even load, one teaches nothing and the other was so hard that the two adults in the household couldn't figure it out either. It as a total waste of money. The ones he goes to repeatedly: for reasoning skills- any of the putt-putt series, and for phonics - Scholastics's Clifford."
2,Off to a poor start,"Five games come in this package. Take the ""StarFlyer Royal Jewel Rescue"" and throw it out. The game was pointless and baffling to my first grader. ""What am I supposed to do?!"" she wailed each time she played. I couldn't figure it out, either. She enjoyed the ""Mind Twister Math"" game the first time she played it, though her friend pronounced it dumb. One of the math games (was it this one?) quickly becomes difficult because the kids have only a limited amount of time to complete the tasks. We haven't tried the ""Reader Rabbit High Flying Act"" or ""Growing up with Arthur"" yet."
2,NO cover!,"Product description is ""Self-opening/closing cover"". Received the basic model Lobby Pro Dust Pan (2531-20), instead of Lobby Pro Upright Dustpan w/Cover. The basic dust pan does not lay flush with the floor, leaving that annoying line of dust after sweeping. You will need to use lysol wipes/paper towels in order to finish the job. The pan is of heavy duty hard plastic & metal handle... Rather not deal with the hassle of having to return, so I will KEEP!"
5,"Great writing, couldn't put it down.",I have read MANY True Crime books and this one is one of my favorites. I highly recommend it.
4,a book worth reading,i read this book some years back and it still sticks with me as some one who has read true crime for years this book kept me intrested from cover to cover while some crime books bore me after the frist half this is a keeper
1,"Big hype, big disappointment.","This show had huge hype and buzz in the fan world - ""the next Cowboy Bebop"" etc.We were really excited about the art and pre-ordered each DVD as it was announced. The first few episodes looked like the hype was spot-on but it very quickly descended into predictable and uninteresting routine. I'm not sure we even bothered to watch the last couple of episodes. I do know that my wife (who LOVES Cowboy Bebop) snored through most of them.I'm sorry we bought the DVDs - we should have waited and rented them."
3,"Already Know CM? Then, Don't Bother","I'm an enthusiastic scrapbooker and an eager reader, so a book about scrapbooking is impossible for me to resist. So, when I found this book on Amazon and saw the great reviews, I ordered it with high expectations.Well, friends, those high expectations were disappointed. This book reads like an extended infomercial for Creative Memories. If you've been to a CM home class, you've heard the basic spiel -- this is just a (much, much) longer version.It's not that I don't agree with the CM message. I think that making albums is extremely satisfying and worthwhile. AND, I agree that it's important not to get overly caught up in the ""craft"" to the detriment of preserving your memories.It's just that this book didn't really give me anything new.If you aren't already a scrapbooker and need some encouragement to start your albums, this might just be the book for you."
5,Very Motivating!! A best seller -in my opinion.,"I just finished reading this book and must say that it is wonderful. There are numerous ideas for getting organized, finding the time and finding the inspiration. So many of us keep saying we need to do this and that but we never get around to it. You can take some of the ideas from this book and apply it to other aspects of your life as well. We all need some motivation now and then and this book provides it. I know that using the tips I found in this book I've been able to not only get motivated to work on my pictures (and journaling) again, but since I am accomplishing something with my pictures I get more energy to do other activities.From my standpoint this book is not some great big advertisement for Creative Memories - yes it probably will help spread their message of preserving photos, but they don't push on you to only use their products."
5,Inspiration to leave a legacy,Though I have been making scrapbook photo albums the Creative Memories Way for about five years I was really inspired by this book to leave a written/photographic legacy for my family. From the examples given by the authors and other contributors I gained a new insight into what to say along with the photos to truely tell the story connected to them. If you want to leave a written legacy that will be treasured or want to share your life in photos try putting them together in keepsake albums and your family will cherish them for generations.
2,Yet another pregnancy book,"The author tries to be upbeat and funny about some of the pregnancy ""symptoms"" and claims to discuss things no one else does. I found the attempt at humor mostly annoying since I felt like she was trying to make fun of some of the quirks that come with the territory. As far as the discussion of things no one else does... maybe that was true 10 or 15 years ago, but she talks about all the ""less than glamorous"" things that everyone else talks about. Overall, the book was mildly amuzing, at best. Save yourself some cash... you'll find more helpful and entertaining pregnancy discussions online (there are many pregnancy blogs out there that don't spare any details and do so in a very entertaining manner)."
3,Not for serious woodworkers,"This is an informative, although rudimentary book. The chapters explaining the different types of fireplaces were well written with a reasonable amount of detail on both gas and wood burning fireplaces. I would recommend this book only for those considering a new fireplace.If your objective is to build a mantle and your skill sets are greater than operating a chopsaw, you'll be disappointed in Fireplace and Mantel Ideas. The mantle plans lack design details that could be added with simple tools such as a router."
2,Not as useful as I'd hoped,"A nice book but not that useful. I just found a brand-new Better Homes and Gardens book on fireplaces, which I like much better. in contrast tothis book, the BH&G book has handsome photos but lots of tips on making over a dated fireplace (which we have to do), as well as choosing and positioning a new fireplace (which we also plan to do in our master suite). The Better Homes and Gardens Fireplace book shows a wider range of room and furnishings styles, and I especially like the room arranging tips in the Better Homes and Gardens book."
1,Just one big advertisement,"This publication is more like an ad than a book. Submissions are actually from manufacturers. There are some nice pictures, but very little original information. I cannot recommend this book for someone looking to build a mantel."
2,Disappointing,Size of Iron covers was inconsistent. Some covers fit well others fell off. Would not purchase these Iron covers.
3,head covers,Covers do not fit well... to tight... but satisfactory. I would have expected a Wilson product to be totally integrated into another Wilson product. Not in this case. I must say I enjoy using Wilson golf products and will continue to buy them. but I can't recommend the iron head covers.
4,Satisfied,"These covers are a little snug for my hybrid irons, but they serve the purpose. Not as flexible as I expected."
3,A little tricky to get off,"These are a little tricky to get on and off but not too bad, may try another set, you just don't want any more frustration than you already have on the course, but for travel etc. these are great and keep the head REAL safe!"
5,Easy on easy off - perfect,"These are simple and work on any club. A little loose for blades but they stay on fine. Numbers are easy to read from the top , fit in you pocket and go back on quickly. What more do you need? Buy two sets incase you need more, they are 1/2 the price of the over-the-top, hard to get on & off ones that the shops have. These are hard to find, I'm glad to have found them."
4,An excellent clubs cover,"My irons are cover and the price is very low. I'm very satisfy with these cover, they protect my clubs pretty well"
1,Took The Class Taught By Chen- Book & Author Both Terrible,"Not only are his language skills extremely lacking, but his coding is sloppy and his teaching leaves MUCH to be desired. Don't think I'm just a disgruntled student who wants revenge on the professor, because I got an A- for the course and I slept through it. The book really is not all that good. The majority of the book itself is references to other resources. What's left is only four chapters that do not delve very deep into any of the concepts that they supposedly cover. It is not worth it to get this book."
1,"omigod, like, this was SOOOOO bad! uh!","sorry, guys, i'd rather eat a toothpaste sandwich while bathing in rotten octopus paste."
2,Still waiting for my replacement part.,Part came with one anchor missing and after one month i am still waiting for a replacement to arrive. Still very frustrated.
2,title description and picture do not match,is this a whole zone valve unit or just power head? the title and picture do not match which could be misleading
4,What's it good for?,"Well, It has the absolute best microphone I ever used. Absolutely perfect for voice chat, telephone calls, and voice recognition. The headsets are, however, uncomfortable to wear because it puts too much pressure on your ears. They don't fit over your ears, they go ON them. The tension system is annoying. As far as sound goes; they seem fine for music, have good bass response, but when I play Quake, the bass is washed out and distorted. But still, the mic is the most important thing here. Even with it's flaws; it is still by far the best headset/mic combo I have ever used. Rat Shack Pro-50MX headset is much better sounding, and has awesome bass, but the mic is absolutely worthless. Now if you could somehow mate the mic from the HS1 to the headphones of the PRO-50MX, THEN you would have THE headset. Sigh..."
3,"Great sound for DVDs, MP3s, & dialpad but damn uncomfortable","The headphones work great except for the fact that it pinches my ears too much. When I wear my glasses, the tight headphones hurt the tip of my ears. it's very comfortable without my glasses but then I would only be able to listen and wouldn't see a thing. I didn't find a problem with this headphones pinching the top of my head (you gotta shift it around til you're used to it). Everyhtng else is excellent. I purchased this headphones as a sort of everything in one: speakers for everyhting and good microphone. It works well but the only problem is after an hour, my ears hurt too much and i have to take them off. so buy this if you don't wear glasses."
2,"Good sound, not comfortable","Good sound, bad design. They gave me a headache after wearing them for 5 minutes because of the way the headset is designed. Usually you can adjust a headset/headphone so that it is snug on you head without putting any pressure on the top of your head. These, however, have a spring in the headset that grips your head tightly no matter how you try to set it for a more comfortable fit. Some people don't have a problem with this, but I am one of the ones who do. So, if you have several inches of hair on the top of your head to provide a cushion for these things, or an extremely hard head, go ahead and buy this one. If you're like me, tho, look elsewhere."
4,Mic + headset...good for audio-video conferencing and music,"This is the high end of Plantronic's 3 PC headsets. It comes with a boom mic built in, adjustable head set, and two ear muffs of medium size (about 2 1/2"" diameter.) It also comes with a ~ 6' long cord, good for reaching the speaker-out jack and the microphone-in jack on the back of your PC. The cord has a mic mute and an earphone volume switch. I use it for both phone calls via the PC and for listening to CDs. The sound quality is pretty good, and from what my friends tell me the outbound sound quality from the mic is very clear as well. They've included a hanger which attaches to your monitor, to keep the headset hanging up and out of the way, which is a nice touch."
5,Quality and Dependability,"I've had this set of phones for a number of years. I'm not gentle with my stuff and they come on and off my head multiple times per day. I use the microphone heavily along with online gaming.This set has been bullet proof and very comfortable to wear. They are large, yet light and the boom adjusts the way you'd suspect."
5,"Great, but a little uncomfortable.",These are terrific headphones for their sound quality and the microphone. I absolutely love the sound they produce. The bass is very deep (perhaps too deep for some -- but it's the way I like my music :) and highs are good as well.They can be a little uncomfortable because the earpads press against your ears too much.
3,Short on Payroll,"Absolutely love OFFICE2007SmallBiz, due the Business Contact Manager, which is suppose to integrate with MS Accounting Pro.We have used QBPro for years, and would like to have closer integration with the BCM, which QB can't do. So we have looked at MS Accounting Pro. In calling MS support, I was told that for the payroll section, the only options in MS is to either (1) use ADP third-party subscription, or (2) do all payroll accounting and deductions manually in Excel, and then import results to Accounting Pro. Not being an ADP fan, I'm a little mifted that those are the only options ==>> all that development, only to come up short on the payroll function. It's the only thing holding us back from using the Accting Pro. I would think that MS would have included that segment."
4,"Accessible work from an eccentric, clever author","This book felt like somewhere between an argumentative essay on the state of fiction and an actual story - but it was wound wondefully together. Managed to make me laugh out loud a few times, which I don't do very often when reading books; mostly because the author managed to twist things so violently away from what I was expecting to read.Very self-referential, but somehow gets away with it completely. Original idea to write about, and an nteresting style of writing that made me want to go and discover more of his work."
3,"A great deal of useful information, poorly communicated.","GPS and its many applications are addressed, including likely future developments. However, the author provides far too much detail about non-GPS systems and devices, making this a pretty boring read."
5,Terry is one of the greatest!,"This is not the ""best"" Terry has recorded, but it still rates a 5 star, the worst song he every recorded was great. His voice not only reminds a person of Elvis, but it has a tinge of Orbison, Buddy Holly, Rick Nelson and Ral Donner in it, which makes is voice very unique. Like Orbison (Crying), no one can sing Suspicion the way he did it. I recommend any and all songs by this singer."
1,A long way from a good book,"This book is horrible.Let me sum it up for you so you don't waste your time reading it.Four suicidal people happen upon each other on top of a building on New Year's Eve. They all intend to jump off, but don't. You are then taken through 300 pages of painful stream-of-conscious dialogue from 4 very uninteresting characters that become friends and do absolutely nothing that resembles a story or is even remotely interesting."
2,Disappointing...,"Aside from some clever dialogue this novel was incredibly disappointing. It might have made a good ""story"" with what little depth it has for an off broadway performance. Having never read any other material by this author I am not likely to take another chance on his work."
2,disappointing,"I feel the same way as the others who were disappointed. I felt no sympathy for the characters, did not like them and sort of wished they did jump! I waited for the characters to start being perhaps nicer but they never did. They were the most unlikeable, self-centered, obnoxious characters and the plot went nowhere for me. It is too bad because I loved ""About a boy""."
1,"A long, long read","I don't think I've ever read a book in which I had absolutely no feelings for ANY of the characters until now. Which surprises me, because I have enjoyed every other Hornby book I've read, which is quite a few, High Fidelity and About A Boy being favorites.It was by sheer force that I got through it in its entirety, and the desire to try to connect with even one of the characters. I found them all to be either completely self-absorbed, dull, pitiful, pathetic, obnoxious, or morally bankrupt.Read anything else by Mr. Hornby - this title was a waste of time."
2,one of his weaker efforts,"I loved High Fidelity and ""About a boy"" but did not enjoy ""How to be good"" or this latest effort ""A long way down"" as it seems to stray away from his strengths as an author which are basically describing how weak and useless males are in a some hilarious context. The characters are weak and it's really hard to believe at any level that they want to commit sucide. Jess is incredibly annoying and although that was the intention her character is simply too much. There are a few funny moments but they are few and far between. It's sometimes hard to figure out if this is a comedy or a trajedy and doesn't really work at either level. Not his best work in any case"
3,"Not his best, in my opinion","I have read several of Nick Hornby's books, and this was not my favorite. I quite enjoyed High Fidelity (much better than the movie, I think) and How to Be Good, but I did not like A Long Way Down.It has an interesting story, but the characters just aren't as involving as in his other books. I would suggest trying one of his other books first, and then maybe this on if you like his style."
4,"Four for dying, well until they meet one another","Ok, I am usually a no fan of Hornby. However, this book was a great treat. Why do I say a book about suicide is a great book. Well, because within the sad tale we see an effort by a small group of people to help one another through depression. They are not entirely successful at their efforts, but they still try and that this is what makes this book a good one. People attempt to overcome their problems rather than simply giving into them. That is a very powerful message and a good one. So get this book and be uplifted, a bit, but not blown away by unrealistic sunshine. A good read."
3,A Bit Too Clever,"Ah, that famous British wit is on full display in this novel, the first one I've read by Nick Hornby. So much wit, in fact, that there's too little plot. Four strangers -- a talk show host with a shattered career, a mother with a comatose son, a deranged Minister of Education's daughter, and a depressed musician -- find themselves trying to jump off the same roof-top, and end up together as a Suicides Anonymous support group, although they spend most of the time trashing each other. It's all an overly clever premise that doesn't sustain itself over 200 pages. There are some genuinely hilarious moments and insights in the novel, diamonds in the mud."
5,Outstanding character study,"A Long Way Down by Nick Hornby is a path-to-redemption story told in unique and authentic voices by two men and two women who meet by chance on the top of a building. Their reason for being up there is to jump off and kill themselves. (They don't, of course, or there wouldn't be a story!) This is a book about suicide, but Hornby manages to make it witty and even laugh-out-loud hilarious at times, without ever being irreverent.Although three of the characters are contemptible and the fourth is pitiful, I developed great empathy for JJ, Maureen, Martin and especially Jess as I read this novel. Not many authors can make me care so much about their characters, and frankly, I didn't expect it of Hornby. I hated when the story ended. If Nick ever decides to write a sequel, I hope he writes a novel about Jess.A Long Way Down is a work of genius, the second best novel of the dozen I've read this year and one I highly recommend."
2,"Didn't see what was ""so great"" about it","While there were some funny moments and a couple of thoughts worth pondering, I kept reading hoping that by the end of the novel I would ""get"" why so many readers are raving about it - but it never happened for me.The only plot the book seemed to have ended in the first 20 pages or so and the rest was predictable and yet totally unbelievable. The characters were hard to like. It just was ""eh"" for me."
2,Disappointing,"As a fan of High Fidelity, About a Boy and How to Be Good, I dove into A Long Way Down without reservation. Unfortunately, it appears that Mr. Hornby has run out of ideas. The plot (which I won't rehash here) is preposterous, the characters are preposterous, one dimensional constructs and after a while, one realizes that Mr. Hornby has not created characters but is using simple stereotypes to push this silly plot forward. There is nothing to be learned from this book, the humor is stale and it does seem (as an earlier reviewer mentions) that Mr. Hornby is intent on simply turning out product. His books are generally quite simply written and entertaining rather than aspiring to literary achievment. But some growth would be expected at this point. This book shows only regression and lack of interest."
2,Jump!,"Although I think Mr. Hornby is clever and interesting, this book is not. If you want to spend a few sorta entertaining hours, you'll do okay, however, if you're thinking this is a great read, a clever and intriguing read, sorry no. Excellent story premise, once in a while a fun line, but mostly superficial and so-not the thought provoking piece we were all hoping for. Mr. Hornby you need a few more drafts before this one is ready to release. Or let a great screenwriter take the premise and just run with it. It would be fun as a movie if better developed. P.S. Why Mr. Hornby selected the most unflattering photo ever seen as the author's pix I have no idea."
2,I was disapointed...,I really enjoyed the movie High Fidelity so I was interested in reading some of Hornby. This was the first book I picked up and I was disappointed. I found the writing juvenile - almost as if it was a first novel written by a young adult. It was not especially compelling and I found I really didn't care much about the characters.I will try again with one of Hornby's other books.
2,"Don't ""jump"" to read this one.","Nick Hornby gives the reader a view of suicide through the thoughts of four distinct characters in A Long Way Down. The reader is presented with a unique writing style that shuffles the narrator of the story through the four protagonists that have all met one new years eve on the roof of Toppers House, a ""hot spot"" if you will in London for people to jump and commit suicide.I found the book to be fairly repetitive and predictable. The characters would give you a hint of their past, then they would come around again and give you a taste more... and so on and so on. It was quite enjoyable as they developed during the first half of the book but I really lost interest on the back nine. I managed to finish only because I hate leaving a book un-read - you never know if the author has something waiting for you in those last 30 pages.This was my first Hornby but I plan to give another one or two a shot.A Long Way Down - 2 starsBe happy,Matthew Sherman"
1,What?,"This book was completely unrealistic. I was so excited to read it because of a good review I had read on it and when I was finished, I was left feeling confused. What was the point of all that? A bunch of people feeling sorry for themselves, having nothing in common and having this weird relationship together. Huh?"
4,strangely enjoyable...,"This book is not a classic; it does not have some deep, hidden message. It does, however, have a quality about it that somehow make you feel slightly better about your life. It is very much in the vein of Breakfast Club, as another reviewer mentioned, and if you liked that movie, like I did as a child of the 80s, then you will most likely enjoy this book too. The story is just as improbable, but if you are able to suspend disbelief and accept the fact that these friendships (or whatever these odd relationships may be) would never exist in real life, then you will be able to buy in, and find something likable and all-too-human in these four people. I found myself wanting to stop what I was doing in the middle of the day and escape into Hornby's world for an hour or two. I would consider picking up another of Hornby's books for his unique way of finding humor in unlikely situations and developing characters that matter... at least for a while. Worth picking up."
2,"witty at first, but then kind of boring","I recently struggled to finish a Long Way Down. While it isn't poorly written by any means, and I surely appreciate Mr. Hornby's sense of humor. I found the plot to be fairly pedantic and boring."
3,A Long Way From His Best,"I am a big Hornby fan. I loved ""About a Boy"" and ""High Fidelity"" even before they were made into blockbuster films with attractive leading men. But Hornby kind of lost me with ""How to Be Good"" and he's only partially recovered my loyalty with this, his latest novel. The story of a Gang of Four who become a dysfunctional family of sorts when they meet at the local do-yourself-in tall building on New Year's Eve, ""A Long Way Down"" is told from mutliple points of view. Hornby does an excellent job of adapting perspective in a believable manner, and though the premise is far-fetched, his versimilitude in terms of language and life philosophy gets this reader to suspend her disbelief. The book lags in the middle third, and only partially recovers by the end. There are more laughs than in ""How to Be Good,"" and the ending is quite light, considering where the book began. Worth a read, but far from his best."
1,Jump!,"I paid good money for this book so I've been trying hard to finish it these last couple of weeks. Hornby hasn't made it easy though. Lacking any of the charm found in his first book High Fidelity, this ponderous piece of garbage may well be one of the first books I have flung out the window in a long, long time. Such a shame too...High Fidelity, About A Boy...fine little reads..Too bad his last two efforts have been such stinkers, this one in particular. One star only because I know the guy can write. You would never know it , however, if this was the first book of his you had bought."
2,Ho Hum,"This is the third book I've read by Hornby and the one I liked the least. I thought it was mildly interesting, but most of the time I was turning pages and sighing with impatience. I didn't believe it. The characters were thin. If you or I wrote a book of this caliber, we'd probably sell about three books, and the reviews would be glum. He has insight, but the story just didn't go deep enough, and I think it was glib. I'll bet he wrote in in about two weeks.Disappointing."
4,A Good Read!! Funny at Times!!,"I quite liked this book. The characters were all unique in his or her own way, and along with the storytelling it gave the book an interesting feel. Not only did we get to know what one character thought, but we got to know what they all thought. This is much different from the typical main character only point of view. Certainly not a memorable book, but a good one none-the-less."
2,This book brought me down!,"I'm a big Hornby fan and have up until this point liked everything that he's written. If you haven't read Fever Pitch, you should give it a go. Having said that, Nick has never disappointed as much as he's done with A Long Way Down. The book starts slow and as much as I hoped would get better, it didn't. Not only do you not feel any empathy for the characters (with the exception of Maureen), you're basically sick of them by the end of the book. The author must of been on a holiday or facing a deadline when he wrote this one. How this got published is beyond me. A long way down, will only bring you a long way down!"
4,Funny and an all around good book,"This book was an interesting subject since it took such a dark subject and made it amusing. It's true to life in many parts, and makes a lot of good points about life in general. This book is more about life and screweing it up than suicide, and is quite enjoyable."
5,More brilliant characters from Hornby,"A Long Way Day is a first-person narrative with four narrators. This could have been confusing or repetitive -- but it's neither. Once the reader is well-into the book, he wouldn't even need the label above each chapter (chapter is not the proper word, but oh well) to know who is narrating. Each character has her or own unique voice, and it's not through catch phrases or some similarly-lazy technique. Each is developed well throughout the book. It is emotional and a little thought-provoking without being overly sappy or morose. I was looking forward to this book, and was not disappointed. As with all Hornby's fiction, I laughed out loud several times, and am only sad that I now have a long wait till his next."
1,AWFUL BLOODY AWFUL,I very rarely don't finish a book. I could not finish this. It was awful beyond awful.I liked Hornsby's About a Boy and High Fidelity.I lost interest in him after the awful How to be Good.. but figured I would give this one a shot since it got pretty decent reviews here.HorribleNone of the characters you care at all about. The way he tells the story is annoying. And nothing of interest happens.Skip it. I stopped reading half way through and don't have one ounce of desire to know what happens.
1,"On the good side, this book could have been worse (but don't know how)","Bemusement. I'm filled with bemusement by the large number of 5 star reviews of this book. This book is improbably bad and I had to abandon it about half way through, going any farther along would have been painful and an unwise waste of time.Other reviews, particularly the one star explain why. This review is just to help lower the star weight and, one hopes, save some hapless reader valuable time and money."
3,Review,"I enjoyed the book even though it was occasionally dry and there was really no end resolution to the lives of the characters. I would recommend the book, but at the same time I will not be re-reading the book anytime soon. Good for book club discussions."
2,"""Down""beat","Four people from extremely different walks of life meet at a notorious suicide spot, and through each other find the will to live... kind of. They try to rebuild their lives... such as they are.Hornby has some insight into the fragility of meaning in life, but it's a little too much on the nihilistic side. And it's not as profound as some of his more original and pointed observations in ""How to Be Good.""Also, none of the characters are too appealing, which is intentional, but it still has a negative effect. I especially disliked the American musician JJ, who kept saying ""man"" and citing cool bands he liked -- Hornby can't resist citing cool bands."
5,Wish it were longer,"I almost put off reading this because I tend to prefer upbeat books and it sounded kind of depressing, being about 4 suicidal people and all. Fortunately some of the other customer reviews convinced me to try it and it has turned out to be one of my favorite books ever! I would urge everyone to listen to the book on CD. The narrator does a superb job of giving authentic and quite distinct voices/personalities to each of the 4 characters so that you always know who's talking. And somehow, amazingly, despite a serious philosophical meaning-of-life subtext, Hornby manages to make this an extremely entertaining and laugh out loud funny book. I literally laughed out loud (I listened to it in my car on my way to and from work) and I hardly ever laugh out loud. I highly recommend the audio version of this book."
5,Hooked on Hornby,"This is the second book that I've read by Nick Hornby and I must say that I was really impressed. The thought of all those suicidal people made me fear that the book was going to be unduly depressing, but that wasn't the case.Hornby managed to explore a delicate topic and to give us interesting psychological and philosophical insights while making the book hysterically funny. That's hard to do and I was surprised at the number of times that I laughed out loud while reading this heartwarming tale.You don't have to be suicidal to feel overwhelmed by life at times. Most of us can relate to that. A Long Way Down is well worth the time to read once and possibly, once again.Sigrid MacdonaldAuthor of D'Amour Road"
1,Awful and disappointing,"I loved High Fidelity and enjoyed the movie About a Boy, but this was horrific. The main characters are extremely unlikeable, and in some cases, absolutely pathetic. The plot was incredibly unrealistic, particularly when they all decide to take a vacation with one another, despite the fact that none of them actually like or enjoy each other's conmpany. This novel just dragged. Several of us read this for a book club and none of us had anything interesting to say about it - it was just plain boring."
3,more good than bad,"I'd have to say that, compared with some of his other work, this book wasn't Hornby's best at all. I'd still give it a good review though, for being thoughtful if not quite as philosophically satisfying as some reviews/synopses I'd seen had made it out to be. So I was a little disappointed but the book was a pleasant read and gave me a decent amount of smiles and even chuckles in its better moments. The major peeve I had with it though, was the JJ character, who is supposed to be American but speaks and narrates with a bit too much British affect--perhaps Hornby needed to be a little more acquainted with American slang instead..."
3,A Long Way Down,"The concept is fascinating: four strangers who meet on a rooftop in the midst of contemplating suicide and form a bond that goes beyond class, gender and age. Sadly, the book really did not deliver. While the first part of the book, as the characters are introduced is humorous and insightful, the book rapidly becomes maudlin and a the characters become flat line-drawings -- the stereoptypical wastrel trying to do good, the stereotypical American wanna-be rocker, the stereotypical angsty-teen-girl, the stereotypical housewife. The characters wander around a little overly-self-aware, a little too melodramatic (even for near-suicides) and continue on a little too easily."
1,Read a different book,This book was one of the most painful things I have ever read. I have loved other Hornby books so I kept hoping that I would start enjoying this book but it never did happen.Simply put - I never began liking any of the characters and really couldn't care less what happened to them.
2,A Long Read,This is my first and last Hornby book. It was slow to get through and when I finished I felt letdown. Only one character came anywhere near to being interesting.
3,"not bad, not great, but a pretty decent read","3.5 really. definitely an interesting and a quick read. it's my first book by this author (though i have seen 2 of the movies based on his books) and i think i'll read some of the other books now too. i'd recommend the book w/the note that even though the main theme in the book is suicide it's not a dark, dreary book, there's quite a bit of humor in it and it really was an engaging book."
1,"Great premise, but disappointing overall","Four very different individuals accidentally meet on the roof where they had all planned to commit suicide.The writing was abysmal and the characters were all very flat and unlikable. There were a few insights I found interesting, but they were presented in a somewhat forced and cliche manner. This is the first book I've read by Hornby and even though it was terrible, I still might give him a second chance with one of his more popular books, such as High Fidelity."
2,"I love Hornby, but not this one","I have really loved all of Nick Hornby's novels. One of the aspects I enjoyed most about ""High Fidelity"" was the very English style of speaking used by the characters. Hornby's storytelling is so visual to me, I can really see the characters come to life, better than many modern writers. I don't know what he was trying to do in ""A Long Way Down"". The subject matter of suicide didn't necessarily bother me, but each chapter was written from the perspective of a different character, which absolutely blew any flow in the story. I found myself constsantly trying to figure out who was who, and who was narrating during this minute. It's too bad Nick Hornby tried to come up with a new and creative way of telling a story, which did not work, as he is so good at what he does."
2,A long boring read,"I've read all Hornby's other books, most of which were great (How to be good was tedious). But this one is slow, dull and barely amusing.The story seems tenuous and at no point did I actually think that any of the characters would really kill themselves, so there was no other reason to continue reading the book.Some of the plot lines are so unrealistic that it's hard to take this seriously at all - what happened to Mr. Hornby? Does he not have standards any more?"
1,Big Disappointment,"I am very surprised by all the good reviews this book is getting. I am a huge fan of High Fidelity and About A Boy, but this book was such a disappointment. It seemed like such lazy writing~I would NEVER think this was the same author."
2,"Well written, boring plot","I enjoy Nick Hornby's writing style and think because he is a talented writer, he was able to get away with this book. Of the 4 main characters in this story, I didn't find one that I cared about. I kept waiting for the story to get good and exciting, but never found it. This book was a major disappointment."
4,Insightful and hilarious.,"Nick Hornby doesn't have the answers to life's great questions but he isn't afraid to tackle them and that's a pretty cool thing in itself.In this one, we have four distinct points of view from four very different people with nothing whatsoever in common other than the fact that they all happened to go to the same spot, at the same time, to try to kill themselves. This gives them a bond that goes beyond the usual criteria for a band of friends. As they begin making a sort of blind leading the blind stab at helping each other out of despair, they learn a bit about a few things and, most importantly, well, time passes.I always learn a bit from Nick Hornby's books and time passes in a most enjoyable way."
2,Not Hornby's Best,"I was intrigued by the premise of this book which started off strongly enough but faded greatly and ultimately left me disappointed. So I give it 2-1/2 stars. Hornby is a fine writer with a gift for creating distinctive, likeable characters. He also has a knack for clever plots. With this book he managed to concoct a fine beginning and decent middle but failed to deliver a clever and/or memorable ending."
2,Overrated,"Nick Hornby phoned it on this one. Hard to believe this book came from the same author who penned High Fidelity and About a Boy. Premise was silly, characters were immensely unlikable (nothing new for Hornby), and story wasn't nearly as funny as his earlier work. Save your money!"
3,somewhat disappointing,"The author does a great job with the character development. The reader feels he truly knows the characters. However, the story itself, needs something more. It wasn't a terrible read, but not a good one, either."
5,Who would have thought suicide could be funny?,"Such a fun read, great characters, insightful story. I loved reading this book."
2,Ho Hum Hornby...,"Let's see...I really liked High Fidelity and About A Boy was also good. I thought How to be Good was somewhat readable. Why not give the 4th Hornby oeuvre a wary, but honest try? Take four characters (including - guess what - a trash-talking teen girl and a failed rock musician), a lot of ""cute"" writing about 'puke' and the expected 'f' word, a couple of contemporaneous references to the politics of George Bush and Tony Blair, endless repetition of narrative and what is left? Not much to recommend.There are lots of improbable vignettes,the sorriest of which (no, not the intended New Year's Eve leap off the building) concerns an intervention brought off in the basement of a Starbucks. This is a pantheon of hokey, jokey characters. Even Maureen, whose life is filled with genuine pathos,not just the tedious whinging of the other 3 mediocrities,has been infused with scant depth by Hornby. This book pushed me over the edge. Nick can do better."
1,nick hornby's fall from grace.,"i have consistantly loved all of hornby's other novels, so i was deeply disappointed and surprised to find a long way down so intensely awful. not only was the plot an utter failure, but the characters were not believable. an original idea went down the entirely wrong path, using the voices of four suicidal individuals with especially drab ways of describing the course of events that make up this storyline, making for an altogether sad attempt at recreating the charisma of hornby's past. if in need of a nick hornby fix, read about a boy or high fidelity again, this one is not even worth a try."
4,a warming touch of humor,"Another great piece of literature from Nick Hornby. Laugh-out-loud humor with plenty of plot twists and a heart warming ending. It is truly hard to find an author as good as Hornby, one who brings me back with every new novel. This book is just as great as any of his previous, but this time with four main characters in switching roles. Each character in this book is hillarious; The shunned former TV star, the troubled teenage girl, the washed up rock musician, and the mother of a retarded child. All four of this crazy suicide support gang found their way into my heart as i read chapter after chapter of Hornby's latest masterpiece. Nick Hornby is a modern day Jane Austen, packing crazy love tangles and humorous results into every page."
