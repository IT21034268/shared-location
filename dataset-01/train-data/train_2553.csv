2,A novelist's exercise.,Superficially written. A novelist's exercise.Better invest (your reading time and) a penny on a beautiful writingGospel of Gabrielby Edward Hays (1996) for profound appreciation of a true untold story telling.
5,The story of all of us,"A great book, both for open minded believers and non-believers. It tells the story of Jesus life in a prosaic way. It is a story about life, death and fate. According to the author Jesus is more a man then a God and, like any other man, many times doesn't understand God's reasons but, although he tries, he can't oppose to God's will. There is a long dialog among Jesus, God and the Devil, the three of them on a boat surrounded by mist, which is very intense. In many parts it is strongly ironical and very witty. Some description are really accurate and full of details. It is a book that, after being read, leaves the reader with something to think about."
5,Maravilhosa simplicidade,"It`s the third Saramago I read, and it`s the best. He exposes his ideas in the simplest way, although difficult to read, and they are all true, as anyone who sees the news around the world can notice. The formlessness in this book is one of its most attractive features. One has to pay much attention to follow the dialogues. The very long sentences give me the impression that the man is talking directly to me, in a casual conversation. I had the occasion to hear him in my town, and he gave exactly the same impression of simplicity. He had received the Nobel prize not long before and was absolutely tired with all the conferences and meetings that ensued. For me this quick conference had a special value, because it was funny when someone had to ""translate"" Portuguese Portuguese to Brazilian Portuguese. It added so much interest. (the review is for the Brazilian edition)"
4,"Saramago wasn't ""forced"" to leave the country...","I don't know why he left, but he wasn't forced to, I think he just got fed up with it. The catholic church lost most of its power ever since the dictatorship was overturned in April 74, so they couldn't possibly impose something like that."
3,A bit disappointing,"I like Jose Saramago as a writer. I like religion as a topic. However, it took me a very long time to get into this book. The first half dragged on for WAY longer than I felt it could have and though the second half delivered everything I'd been hoping for all along, the fact that it took so long to get to it was bit disappointing. In the end, I think it could have been more effective as a novella. That said, I did enjoy it once it got moving."
3,Good enough,"It has a cute episode describing how Dora met all her friends, which is very necessary for any Dora fan to watch. I personally purchased the Movie just for the Chocolate Tree episode. Love It!"
3,I can't believe it....,"What a desillusion.... At that price the book should at least have color photos!The quality of the printed material, to me, rates a 2.5.The rest a 4. Average a 3 star."
1,Outdated & Basic,"I found this book to be full of extremely outdated, basic information. Certainly not worth the price I paid. There was no useful information about what's going on in the spa industry today or in the last several years. Do not waste your money."
4,Good for those mirror closet,I brought it when my baby starts to know how to open the closet. The suction is good and my baby now unable to open up the closet. I going to buy more for my other room.
5,window security stopper,"Great for families with young children or concern about window access during summer months when windows are open. Easy to stick, stay in place and remove without damaging window or frames."
1,Useless,"I really wanted this to work. Five minutes after I put these on the window my 10 month old climbed up on our ground level window sills and pulled them right off. I left two on a high window for a couple of days until my mother (who didn't realize they were there) opened the window right up with very little resistance, leaving the stoppers in place. We're still trying to find a solution that doesn't involve bars."
2,"Pops Out Easily, Weak.","I have 2 kids with Autism and need secure window locks. I used these as backups for a while, but they pop off easily and often, and are too easy for my kids to remove. Perhaps they'll work for very young children who don't yet have the ability to grip an object."
4,Simple and Effective,"Bought this for our sliding glass door that leads to the balcony. Was very easy to install and works as it should to keep the door from opening. it falls down from time to time as any suction cup does, but since it requires no tools or ruining the door frame, I'd say that's a minor problem. If there's a child that likes to play with the door, checking the doorstop each night or morning would probably be an easy routine adjustment."
2,to easy to overcome,i was expecting a better performance. it can fall by some push and doesnt stay firmly. i was dissapointed because im looking for something better but the bar at the bottom in the track is to cumbersome. this divice is too easy for security.
2,Too Old to Carry Production Values,"The performances by Caballe and Vickers were excellent, but the visual quality of the video is inferior, blurred with mushy color. The original was too old to reproduce satisfactorily, I assume."
3,Wie schrecklich!!!,"I agree with most reviewers that the performance is absolutely outstanding. M. Caballe/Vickers command a performance that will be tough to match. Not only the singing but acting remains to be commended. So why three stars?1) The audio recording was absolutely horrid. It was scratchy, as though I was listening to a worn out photograph.2) The video was gastly. Through most of the performance, one could never clearly see either the stage nor the actors. It would have been best to just turn the video off.3) The wind did not contribute to the ambiance of the opera. Surely they could have recorded on a less windy night? It was very disturbing to watch actors struggling with their costumes about to be blown away.Audio and video technology at the time of this performance should have been adequate the favorably capture the full talents of Caballe and Vickers. It is a disgrace to their talents that recording engineers made such a mess of this performance."
5,"Please, please stop!",I think this is the best Norma-video we have with Caballe in breathtaking form. One can accuse her of being non dramatic but not here IMHO. She sounds and acts fabulous. Veasy is absolutely lovely as Adalgisa and Vickers quite good as Pollione. I love the wind caressing the beautiful costumes and the flowing hair of Caballe. Callas saw this video and loved it so much that she sent Caballe the earrings she was wearing when she opened the La Scala season as Norma in 1955. Please stop fighting! Lets have peace! This is SO hurtful.
2,Sound quality ruins experience.,"This is probably my family's favorite opera. We own the recording by Caballé and Domingo, and have listened to it many times. No one sings this role with more warmth and beauty than Caballé. We were excited to watch this opera, and we were able to borrow a copy through our inter-library loan system. It's true - Caballé is in top form here. She acts wonderfully and sings beautifully. But the acoustics of the theater made the other lead singers sound tinny and shrill. Vickers looked unconvincing and grouchy, and even missed one of the high notes. The worst part was the wind noise. It got so terrible that finally, we couldn't finish watching it. What an unfortunate thing to have made the one film of Caballé singing this beautiful opera, at an outdoor amphitheater! A terrible shame. I hope some new talent will come along and make a film of this opera with modern sound equipment - and not film it outdoors!"
1,Norma with Montserrat Caballe,"""Norma"" is a very beautiful Bel Canto opera by Bellini. It is best known for its lyrical, haunting, and unforgettable area (once you hear it it's difficult to get out of your head), ""Casta Diva"". It is sung by Montserrat Caballe, a Spanish soprano who has one of the most beautiful voices alive. She plays the title roll of Norma, a story of the Celts during the Roman evasion. She and one of the Romans are in love with each other.A major contribution to this performance is that it takes place in the ancient Roman theater at Orange, France. Being done in the open, the wind also plays a roll.It is staged in a pretty traditional opera style. It is therefore not quite as dramatic as Maria Callas would have done. But I feel that the quality of Montserrat's voice and the setting more than compensate. It is in its original Italian with English subtitles and runs for 161 minutes. I recommend it highly (4 stars) Purchased at Amazon."
5,This is a great book!!!,"My cousin gave me this book when I was about fourteen, along with the Silver Sun and Sable Moon. I'm now 18, and still read and reread the books. I love them!!! The Silver Sun is definitely the best. Everyone should read them. I am also glad to know there are more books about them. The Book of Suns also is about the world Isle that is the world of Alan and Hal."
5,Incredible Fantasy Novel,"Nancy Springer enthralled me when I was 15 years old with the Silver Sun. Little did I know there were three other books, The White Hart, The Sable Moon, and the Black Beast.The four novels were so incredible you have to read them to really appreciate them. Nancy creates a world we would love to be in, yet in times would not want to be in the fight for.Hal endures great torture, Alan embodies great love. Hal has the deep gray eyes of mystery, Alan the deep blue of love.To know more ... YOU HAVE TO READ THESE BOOKS!"
5,Another in a good series,"this book, i feel, can stand out on its own along with reading the series for backstory. it is one of my favorite books out there from one of my favorite authors and favorite series. not many books really follow the more evil side of dealings in the forgotten realms and i enjoy what is in this book."
5,Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle -- how can you go wrong?,"I bought the whole Sellswords in a set ... this was before I knew that ""Servant of the Shard"" was actually one of the Drizzt books and I already owned it! Oh, well, it looks good and I needed to re-read it anyway.I'm only on Book II but if you've read any Salvatore you know that you can always count on an exciting read. The comedy aspects of his writings have never gotten much play, but I've laughed more in these books than in any of the Drizzt (and related characters) saga. Jarlaxle in particular is written with many a good zinger in there. Very entertaining.Anyway, your travels with Drizzt are not complete unless you read the Sellswords. (Artemis Entreri is one of my favorite anti-heroes. What would Freud have said with him on the couch?) Colorful, exciting, great characters ... highly recommended."
5,Fantastic!,"For any Drizzt lovers, you must know this novel and Sellswords trilogy is about Artemis and Jarlaxle, but it's no less amazing! Salvatore is always brilliant with his politics and action to create a perfect story. His political issues are just as interesting as the action and interactions between characters!"
5,Great Looking Book,I got the book within a few days and it was in great shape. I have not read it yet but I know it is going to be a great book because I have read many many R.A. Salvatore books. And He always brings the best to the table.
4,A great debut for this interesting duo,"Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle are just great characters and blend so well together. They are so different and yet similar.The story itself is great and makes Entreri really shine in my opinion. This book could stand on it's own without any other books following.If you are a fan of Artemis Entreri, Jarlaxle or both, than this book is an absolute must read!"
1,What the hell happened?!?,"I would have given this no stars if I knew I could. I thought the name was familiar but didn't realize it was the same book in the Paths of Darkness compilation. Where did they meet the Dragon sisters? All of a sudden they are fleeing from a Lich in book 2 which I read first. Big disappointment in him with the end of this series also, and The Thousand Orcs. They are more formidable than 5,000 drow? Quit now Salvatore."
4,Favorite,Great show. Entertaining and enjoyed watching the Troopers at work. As with the first season they showed the Troopers in many different situations and areas of the great state of Alaska.
1,"C'mon, we're better than this.","Walworth's books (now two of them) have the sad tendency to reduce the trans experience to a path of struggle and pain. For lots of us, that's not how it works when we approach the world as active contributors. If a worker is a good worker, well-liked by his/her coworkers, they won't have a problem with the transition. If the worker is so self-indulgent as to demand special consideration (meetings, sensitivity training, books) how can the organization respond positively?"
5,Like sleeping on a real bed...,"I recently went on a couple of camping trips.... One using this pad and another on an air mattress.. Let me tell you, this pad was actually a lot more comfortable than my air mattress... It was just like sleeping on a bed at home.. Item rolls up into a compact sack that fits perfectly in my day pack. I highly recommend this product to anyone that is going camping. Definately worth the price."
2,Nothing earthshattering to be honest,"Onar can surely write some sleepy , relaxing melodies yet their debut has nothing more to offer besides that . The problem with "" To Ergo Pu Pezun Ta Matia Su "" is simple : it lacks good vocals and the inspiration to help these twelve tracks take off . The lyrics sound like they have just come out of a fifteen year old girl's poem diary and even though the artwork and the tittles imply something deep and dark , we never receive it."
4,Informative and Entertaining,"I have recieved the Michael Jackson 'Behind the scenes...dvd and the innocence>bracelet which i love and wearing it right now. I watched the dvd straight>away and thought it was great. It got me laughing at times, especially the>bit where the the text on the screen was saying 'watch carefully' and then>it said 'her coat' and by the time this women has finished her conversation>she had her coat fully off. it was funny. i just hope people will except>Michael rather than to judge him, but no doubt that people are still listening>to his music, he's a musical genius, i hope he shines as he always did to>his fans.>Thanks once again>UK"
5,Pearl Jr. always presents Truth and Facts!,Pearl Jr. did a wonderful job! this documentary projects truth of Michael Jackson! Prooving his innocence in the 2005 trial and what an amazing person he really is.
2,Behind The Scenes At the Michael Jackson Trail,"Very poor DVD. Some clips okay some not, I was sad that I got this. I am asking for a refund. Do not buy this.Pat Louisville, Ky.)"
3,Passable Trek-entertainment,"I read this book some time ago and I have forgotten most of the plot and other finer details. (Reading the synopsis made me wonder if those things really happened in this book!) What I remember best are those wonderful humoristic moments which play with the cliches and pillars of the Star Trek universe. I know that Peter David is a gifted writer but this isn't his best book. However, it is wholly readable although - as I have proven! - forgettable entertainment."
3,Good. Just plain good...,"I really didn't like this CD at first. But after 'forcing' myself though listening to it, it turned out to be pretty good. I liked CD1 a bit more than CD2. ""Sweet Sorrow"" by ferry corsten was uplifting."
4,Very worth the money,"This book is very easy to read. If concepts such as networking, BSPTrees, and AI are alittle fuzzy, this book should make it very clear. It only gets 4 stars because I felt the book to be slightly incomplete towards the end."
3,Not quite worth the money,"Although Perez does make an effort to offer the reader more than what's found in the Direct 3D help files (more so than Kovach), he still doesn't offer us anything more than is already out there.In fact, I have not seen a good Direct 3D book yet. In my opinion, the best book on Direct X is the ""OpenGL Programming Guide."" Really, I'm not being sarcastic. I use it to learn how to make the calls, then look up the calls using the Microsoft Direct 3D help files. This approach works especially when using the D3DX interface.After looking through Perez' book while at the bookstore, I realized that still the best books on algorithms are Rogers' ""Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics"" and of course, ""Computer Graphics: Principles and Practices"". If you couple those books (and you should already have them if you're serious about computer graphics) with the OpenGL and Direct 3D help files mentioned earlier, then you will have a complete 3D graphics library."
2,"""Advanced"" development by a non-developer","It is disturbing how many game development books are written to teach professional game development, but are written by people who have never worked on a professional game. This makes me wonder if the author is presenting real information, or if it is simply his own view of what he thinks game development may be like. In any case, the ""advanced"" tag is misplaced."
3,Miss Leading,This books description is a little missleading. not saying anywhere that it was writen for visual c++. Not knowing this i now have to buy the microsoft compiler.
2,Not good at all.,"The writer of this book has tried to get as much information as possible into a single book. He has put: WindowsProgramming DirectDraw, Direct3D, DirectSound, DirectInput. AI programming Network programming Basic 3d Math, Advanced 3d techniques Since he tries to put this much information into a single book he just touches some of the subjects very little. In order for each subject to be clear I feel like I need one book for each of the lines above. It seems like the author has tried very hard to show everybody all he knows and to teach everyone all of this but you just end up confused. Luckily I already know alot about DirectX so I bought the book for the 3D parts but I read all of it and wasnt pleased."
3,Good Reference...that's all,"When I first looked at the Table of Contents, I thought this book was too good to be true! It seemed to include everything I needed to create my own game. However, after reading through less than half of the book, I became bored. There is simply too much information and lack of explanation.I'm not saying that it is completely useless, just confusing. I did find this book useful alongside MSDN and several other online resources I found. If you're expecting a step-by-step walkthrough of Direct 3D applications, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,disappointing battery life,"I ordered this replacement battery in January 2008. After about 18 months, the battery life has decreased considerably. It's now October 2009, and I cannot go more than 5 minutes before the battery dies. I don't know if this is typical for NiMH batteries, or specific to this manufacturer."
5,akebono act1012 proact ceramic brake pad set,These brake pads work great for a reasonable price. The original ford pads were terribly dirty and dusty. These are the only pads I use on every thing I own.
5,Simply Amazing,"Glen Cook at his best. 4 years later, things bound to change. Goblin, is he really dead? Tobo, strong enough to take One-Eyes place? I think this book offers closure to the whole glittering stone saga. Familiar faces still around, i.e. Croaker (the narrator again THANK YOU), Tobo has grown into a fine young man. Murgen, the standard-bearer, as well as others, such as willow Swan and the traitor Mogaba. Many questions were answered and all in all Cook did another great job. Highly Recomended!"
5,Soldiers live. And wonder why.,"There were dreams. I remembered everyone who had gone before me. I remembered the places and times. Cold places, hot places, weird places, always stressful times, swollen with unhappiness, pain and fear. Some die. Some did not. It makes no sense when you try to figure it out. Soldiers live. And wonder why.Oh, it's a soldier's life for me. Oh, the adventure and glory! -CroakerThis one paragraph (actually two) really some up the entire book. I spent a lot of time thinking of a some way to tell you all what this book was about without giving anything away, because I wouldn't want it. I can say this, you will be suprised at the changes that all the characters have gone through.I spoke with the author in Minneapolis, and was told that there might be another book about the Black Company. The publishers are demanding another one, he hasn't made up his mind yet.Defintely a good read."
1,Terrible,"Whomever said that this could have been written by One-eye was right. It's formulaic, and poorly written.These oh-so-clever Mercenaries who have outsmarted gods and demigods alike, now find themselves unable to defeat untrained raw recruits, and instead decimate themselves as a plot device to end the saga.I can't believe that the other reviewers are giving this book and the author such an easy ride. The other books in the series (notably the first trilogy) are far better than this.As the Black Company headed south, so did the quality of writing in this series.Reading this book reminds me of what a wonderful author Iain M. Banks is. If you want some quality storytelling, try out his stuff.I have purchased every Black Company book since I saw the first one in 1984. After reading this book, I will not touch another novel by this author."
1,Disappointment,"It doesnt lenghten, nothing special, it definetly doesnt worth the money... I can only use this as a comb next to my main mascara if there is any sticking.Dont waste your money!!!"
1,Blah,Too much back and forth. I didn't like the dialogue it was really boring! I just wanted to through the book down
2,Sealed with a Kiss,"This book was just too painful to read. I have read and enjoyed other books by this author, but this one has earned its place in my ""never read again"" pile."
4,"Subjective, Polemical, and Magnificent","Paul Johnson never fails to entertain and inform at the same time. Johnson's account of English history is subjective and polemical yet magnificent in scope and synthesis. For the reader who wishes to gain an insight into the broad sweep of English history from Roman times to the (nearly) present, this book is a good place to start. To be sure, the same reader will need to look elsewhere for a clarification of many issues and a deeper understanding of certain important areas which the author fails to discuss at length or leaves out almost entirely. All the same, this book is sure to whet the appetite. (It is interesting to note that this book, as one of the earliest written by Johnson, displays a tendency towards a liberal or leftist interpretation of historical events and phenomena. This inclination was modified in the author's later life, as he moved rightward on the political spectrum in old age.)"
4,Over all I liked this book,"A 1.Nf3 player could be thought of as a d4 player who is chicken of the Nimzo!But when you study 1.Nf3 you learn to appreciate it more for what it is. To really master this opening, you have to learn to pick and choose from several openings.Where I like his book is on the Closed Reti, Reverse Benoni Reti, and the Reti Accepted. I think he has some great ideas in there. But when it comes to this books section on the Slav Reti. Well the lines he gives white has to sacrifice a pawn. I don't buy it white gets compensation in these lines he suggests.Against the Slav Reti I think the best way to go against it is go into the Slav! That is where I said you got to pick and choose. When to go into an English or d4 opening or stick with the Reti.Over all I liked the book very much."
3,worse than better,only really works for high tension need and if the lugs arent greased right and tough to tighten anyway it proves to be useless i find it easier to tune by myself. best bet is to go by ear or get an actual tuner
2,Terrible,"This item is good for tuning a snare drum maybe, but it doesn't go low enough for toms or bass drums. Instructions are minimal. Torque values are not in any recognized unit of measure, just arbitrary numbers."
3,....,"Mine never came to my hands, but seller give my money back. A friend of mine have one and it's not the best, it works whit a lot of torque, but if you set it to MIN, i think it needs some lubricant or a better regulation to lower torque needs, at minimum not works at all, at maximum... NOT WORKS. Instead of this... it's a nice drum key"
3,ehhhh,"i would use this again, the plastic around the ball scraped away and the ball flew out making it useless"
2,Don't read this book.,"This book can be thought of as reflecting prejudice that those non-math or non-stat people can benefit only from the books without mathematical gimmichks. Without basic mathematical expressions and statistical explanations, this book seems to fail in providing proper knowledge on the methods. Try Lawless and Lee's books, which employ some mathematics and statistics. Even though we are not math or statistics majors, we can select and pick up what we need for application."
2,Solid greek rock,"There's one worthy song in here , the thundering "" Liomeno Pagoto "" which was the band's biggest hit ever . The rest are relatively enjoyable yet surely not as gripping as that song . After many failed attemps to score similar sales with Pera Apo Tis Polis Tis Asfaltu the group went suddently lo-fi and tried to adopt an underground sound and image. Fact remains though that they never released anything as captivating as that first big hit..."
1,late delivery,Flashlight was shipped to the wrong address and was delivered 2 weeks after Christmas. Christmas delivery was promised.
2,Just what it says.,Exactly what the name implies. One girl (Summer) nude or in the process of getting nude. Two stars for her and none for the 60min. DVD. Perfect for softcore buffs.
2,Worked good for 18 months...,"The alternator was shiny and new. Installation was fairly straight forward and it started working right away.18 Months later, it stopped working without warning. Removed it from my truck and took it to Autozone for testing. It failed all 3 tests - the diodes and regulator failed. The 12 month warranty has expired and now I have to buy a new one. I'll be buying one from Autozone as they offer a lifetime warranty and can replace it off the self with no shipping if it fails again."
1,Great Pictures But No Information,"If you know that ""life needs water,"" ""water comes from clouds,"" and ""frogs skin requires moisture,"" then you won't have learned anything after watching this show. The narration is full of banalities, generalities and common knowledge.Although the pictures are beautiful, they don't often have anything to do with what the narrator is talking about. Although you will miss the music if you turn off the audio, that's the only thing you'll miss. The title is also misleading. The show doesn't confine itself to oceans, lakes, and rivers, but also examines life in the mountains and rainforests.If you like hi-def pictures of water and animals, this is a great show; but if you want to learn something, this is not the movie for you. Instead, try David Attenborough's ""Blue Planet""Blue Planet: Seas of Life (Special Edition)"
5,Stunning Image,"Don't hestitate to buy this DVD. Much, much better than Planet Earth. Beautiful and stunning image. I owned Blue Planet, Coral Sea Adventure, Planet Earth, Animal Amazing Event but this one is the best."
2,"Looks good, but........","I purchased this product on 02/01/08. I was excited because the beds would be able to be seperated later on. Product came on 02/13/08. There was no intructions or hardware in any of the boxes. Called the manufacturer and they shipped out the hardware and instructions via fedex. Received the hardware/instruction package today. After careful review of the instructions it appears as though the initial package contains some wrong parts. I have called the company, but it's after closing time friday so I will hear nothing back until next week. Bed looks like it would be sturdy if I could ever get it set up. Would definitely never buy from this Atlantic furniture again. I purchased this product 02/01/08 and probably won't be able to get it set up until March. Ridiculous! Not worth the hassle."
3,Good but there's better...,My son tolerates this bread but we've found that it is dryer than some of the other Ener-G Loaves. It was slightly cheaper than some of the others as well... It is better for toast than sandwiches.
1,taste and texture is poor,just a warning to people -its nothing like regular bread.it needs to be toasted to even be edible at all.refund arent allowed but ill probably donate this product away...or toss it
1,The good reviews just mystify me,"I don't understand how anyone with a pair of taste buds to rub together would give this bread a 5 or a 4 or a 3 or even a 2. It's simply gawdawful bread. I'm not sure that it should be called bread lest the wrong impression be created. I got a sample pack of 20 different breads, two slices each, of gluten free breads from EnerG. I've tried 6 and of those 2 didn't make it thru the first bite and actually I didn't swallow those. Of the remaining 4 the grades (I'm keeping track in case I find one I like) range from C-F and there's just the one C. I may give up bread altogether if this one is considered good. I don't think I can handle much more crushing disappointment. I'm not blaming EnerG, the ingredients are the ingredients...."
5,"thank you, Amazon",The bowls were a perfect addition to the set of Christmas tree dishes I have been gathering for my son and family. The price was very good and delivery fast.
1,Never Received,Ordered Item in June & still have not received item 3 months later. Contacted seller-seller said he would send another out-never received that one. Very Disappointed!
3,It's Okay,"Hot Women, but just okay movie. If you mute it out and fast forward to the sex, its pretty good in a mild way."
1,Not worth the coin,"Don't waste your time folks, this is such a bad skin flick that not even teenagers will make it through."
5,Excellent Movie!!,Superb acting. I wanted this movie for years but could not find it. My husband and I happened to see it on tv one day and I HAD TO HAVE IT. The story has a tragie event but ends up a truly wonderful love story. I can't imagine that anyone would not enjoy this awesome movie.....
1,Does not work.,"When I plug it into my X-10 compatible device, the red led goes off and I get no connection.This is the 2nd bad unit I have purchased (PL513)."
4,"fabulous trolleys, fabulous","great movie, sums all that it can about trolleys in fifty minutes, stars the seashore trolley museum so if you're a member this is a must have, this a shorter version of the movieTrolley: The Cars That Built Our City [VHS] but you go to museums and see new footage"
4,Arabic music with a Western Flair!,Fairuz combines western musical instruments with Arabic style to produce a pleasing arrangement of Arabic music to those looking for an introduction to Arabic music. This would make a great addition to your CD collection if you are looking to expand your international collection.
1,The Legendary Fairuz,"A vocalist of the caliber of Fairuz deserves far more sensitive accompaniment than that provided on ""The Legendary Fairuz"" CD. Also the applause should have been suppressed. A traditional backup consisting of oud, doumbek, perhaps clarinet, guitar, accordian of high quality and respectful of the soloist would have been immeasurably more satisfying. I have just ""discovered"" Fairuz and would like to acquire other CDs by this artist but the accompaniment must be much more respectful of the artist who is apparently a legend in the world of Arabic music."
2,Piss Poor recording,"Don't buy it, unless you're dying to hear Feiruz like I was. Her voice gets so monotonous after a while. I gave the CD away!"
3,Poor quality album. It looks pirated!,"This album fails to show Fairuz' and the Rahbani Brothers' musical greatness. The low quality of the album is one reason, and it's because it was recorded poorly from live concerts. If you want to learn about Fairuz, check her album 'The Very Best of Fairuz'. It contains the most popular songs that everyone enjoys. I think that album works the best as an introduction to the music."
3,"Fantastic vocals, schmaltzy instrumentation","Fairuz must have one of the best female voices in the Arab world, but the overly sentimental instrumentation seems inappropriate and distracting. I would have loved to hear her beautiful voice with a more traditional, non-Western orchestra. If a recording of that nature exists, someone please let me know about it!"
3,Not the best recording,"This album was compiled from previous live performances in the 60's and 70's. The recording is too noisy, and it's only worthwile for people who want to enjoy Fairuz's voice.Personally, I only got that album because of the first song ""ya mina el 7abayeb"". I didn't find the rest much interesting."
5,Excellent!,"I am a huge fan of Fairuz, I eally enjoyed this CD and found myself singing from it during class! The sound of the recordings are alittle low and u can tell it's her live stuff, but other then that is a excellent album!"
3,"Good bib, velcro sucks!","The thick neck works great but the velcro was a mess after the first wash and it gets stuck on everything. It's very hard to get the bib on and off because the velcro is so sticky. They do wash up well and are very soft. They fit my newborn very well.Because of the velcro I would not buy these again.Update 11-28-12We have started solids and these are now my favorite bibs! They ate still soooo soft and not stained at all, even after multiple feedings of orange veggies! What mom (or dad) doesn't wipe their baby's face with the bib? With this one, it's not scratchy and he hates it less than other bibs. I still hate the velcro, but I am willing to deal with it because these are so soft on his face. They are also thick enough to absorb the massive amounts of teething drool without needing to be changed every hour."
5,Great Bib,I got tons of bibs at my shower... they are cute ones but do not work for my newborns who are bottle feeding... maybe better for eating solids when they are older. These bibs are perfect for babies who are bottle feeding catches the milk dripples. Argee with what pervious person said too $$$ on amazon $6.99 for same thing at Target.
3,Hate when I love something that ;(,"My baby is a spitter-upper like no other! It's been very annoying and this product seems to help with the wetness rolling down his neck and spoiling his clothes. BUT the last order that I got, the bib was separating from the seam. This is before a wash. I didn't return as I don't have time.I really do like this product design, so just check your order before using."
1,"Fantastic Bib, Way over priced on Amazon","The bib I would give 5 stars, the reason for the one star rating is the price. These bibs are excellent, as they seem to be the only ones that fit close into the neck and stop milk/food dribbling down the neck. BUT, on Amazon they are $14.99, at Toys R Us they are $6.99. I cannot understand how they can be so much more expenseive here."
4,Great absorption,"If you're like us, we had acid reflux babies which meant lots of spitting up. The bibs were fantastic for absorption. The only issue was that the velcro on the back would irritate their necks."
5,Perfect bib!,Best ever for infants! The rolled collar catches all the dribbles. Order several - we like the neutral color so they can be used for a long time.
1,Deceptive Price on Order,"I am very disgusted with the cover-up on my purchase of the pump it up super hold styling spritz pray. For the price I was expecting 10 ounces but the fine lettering stated that it was only an 8 ounce bottle and this was only after my order and delivery was on the way. The vendor needs to specify what ounces he delivered because this is poor business practice. And very deceptive. I am very dissatisfied. Because ""boldly he specified 10 ounces"" so boldly he should tell the purchaser this is not true. This is the first time I've ever been tricked on Amazon.com."
3,Uniden DECT-3 6.0,Sound quality of handsets is great. I was a little disappointed that the handsets did not have illuminated keys and that the answering system only holds 14 one minute messages. The DECT 6.0 transmission frequency works as advertized. It does not interfere with Wi-Fi connections which is the main reason I purchased this system.
4,A good phone,"We've had this phone for a while now, and it works well! Zero interference, and a very good battery life. Call quality is clear, and we just really haven't had any issues with it. Interestingly, the DECT phones are used like crazy in Europe, and I think that's probably the reason that the answering machine has an English accent!"
4,Uniden DECT1080-3,Uniden DECT1080-3 DECT 6.0 Cordless Digital Answering System with Caller ID with 2 Extra HandsetDECT 6.0 CordlessThe phone works great. It's loud and clear. I ordered 2 extra headsets for a total of 5. You can name the handsets by their location and make intercom calls to the different headsets. You can enter your phone numbers into one headset and transfer them to the other headsets.Note: Time is a 24 hr clock and the date is dd/mm/yy so today is 21/12/07.The headsets only hold 24 digits per entry. So you can not store both a calling card number with the phone number. You can store the calling card number as and entry and then dial the number you want. Per tech support the DECT-2080 solves this problem. 10-10-987 numbers work fine.
3,Uniden's untypical woes...,"Unfortunately I found a better price locally after my order already shipped. If you are a Sams Club member the price could be as low as $20 less.Aside from price there are a lot of neat features with the phone. One that could be made clearer deals with the ""rings to answer"" that you know from other phone answering systems. They call it something else, ring delay. The manual did not explain this and the ""ring delay"" is set up to pick-up after your choice of 10, 20, 30 seconds... it really didn't make sense, especially having owned another Uniden phone answering system where it was called ""rings to answer"" and you choose 4 rings or whatever you want."
1,1080=Bad Model,"Purchased mine at BJ'S club for $89.00.Cons:*Lack of conference ability using 2 or more handsets at the same time, unless you transfer the call to it.*Keypad does not light up.*Use army time Time, 24 hr not 12 hr clock and the date is dd/mm/yy.*Answering machine OGM has an English accent."
1,Worst phone I have ever had,"No manual came with it, Uniden wants $5 for one on their customer support page on there website.Phone gets poor reception beyond 30 feet from base. Do not know if range issue is Uniden or all DECT 6.0, but looking for alternative now. Will never buy Uniden after this one.Ringer not loud enough to hear much over 5 feet from phone.PS: They never responded to my email for support."
2,Very good phone.,Use army time.When you set the date use the day of the month first and the month second.Four star's.
3,Somewhat comfy but Overpriced,Thermarest mattresses are somewhat comfortable but extremely overpriced. The fact that the stuff bag for the mattress must be purchased seprately leads me to the opinion that Thermarest is a rip off.
2,Didn't fit my speakers,"This might not by typical, but the female connectors on these harnesses did not fit my 6.5"" speakers. The live wire connector is 3/16"", and the ground wire is 1/8"". I wish the manufacturer would list these measurements somewhere. I'm going to cut off the ends and crimp new connectors that will fit."
3,"""Pokemon"" meets ""Baywatch""?","""Surf's Up, Pikachu!"", adapted by Bill Michaels, is #1 in the Pokemon Junior book series. Geared towards younger readers, this book recounts an adventure involving the Pokemon characters.I have only a passing familiarity with the Pokemon phenomenon, and my impression of this book is that it is mainly geared to readers who already are conversant in the Pokemon mythos. I imagine that kids who aren't Pokemon fans will get 3 pages into this and go ""Huh?""The story begins with Ash and Pikachu at the beach on Seafoam Island. They meet Victor, a surfer who, together with his own Pokemon, plans to surf a legendary wave known as Humungadunga. But trouble arrives in the form of villainous Team Rocket.The story is OK, but the illustrations seem to be merely random pictures of Pokemon characters; these illustrations seem to have no real relationship with the story. If your beginning reader is a Pokemon fan, he/she might like the book; otherwise, I can't recommend it."
4,just a couple of flaws in the plot,"The story concerns a surfer whose ambition is to ride a giant wave which appears only once every 20 years and to plant a flag on a small island to which the wave would bring him.At the end of the story, he rides that wave out of the necessity of saving a Pokemon which he owns. He plants the flag, but the story never explains how he happened to have that flag in his hand while he was so concerned over saving his Pokemon.Furthermore, is the island is so remote that planting the flag there is proof of riding the giant wave? If so, then how does he get back to shore where the other characters congratulate him?Just one gripe about the Scholastic Pokemon books: I wish they would have illustrations that fit they stories, rather than cutting corners with stock pictures of Pokemon characters."
5,Murder in Mixteca,"This book is really different. It starts off in Wyoming but moves to southern Mexico where the detective, Tommy Thompson, gets involved in artifact smuggling, Indian revolutionary action, corrupt Mexican politics and a bunch of other stuff you don't get from the mainline writers of mysteries. It's the sequel to Murder in Jackson Hole, which I really liked, but this one is pretty darn exotic. Like I said, it's different. Loved it."
4,Love the larger bag,I like chocolate better but vanilla is good with frozen fruit almost like a smoothie.
5,The Exemplary Husband,This is a fantastic book for all husband so they can follow Christ example of how He loved the Church and how He gave His life for her. This book teaches husbands their God given role on how to love thier wife to the obedience of Christ.
5,Amazingly balanced,"Fantastic book that every husband should own. Terrifically balanced, and every point is backed up (and often backed up several times) with Scripture, which most don't do.For all us visual learners, there are plenty of charts and graphs to help explain and clarify certain points.I can't recommend this book enough!!!"
4,Sound Bible teaching,This was very helpful in discipleship. The book is a good reminder to those who are striving to make a good marriage great.
3,A Two Hundred Page Introduction,"This book has some really good things to think about. I'm not sure I agree with every word, but it definitely calls attention to the rationalized motivations that can easily become very bad and destructive habits for any man. My biggest gripe with the book is probably style. As another reviewer said, it seems very shallow. I kept feeling like I was reading an introduction through the entire book. Almost nothing is explored in depth in over 200 pages. Some readers have had a problem with the very authoritative role the author encourages for men as head of the family, but I will say that he heavily stresses the fact that leading does not mean leading by force or intimidation. He may overshoot a little, but I think the author is simply trying to encourage men to take more of a leadership role in the family, particularly when it comes to spiritual matters which is often lacking even in our churches."
1,No Closed Captioning,"The description says this is closed captioned for the hearing impaired, but the product is not. Too bad, I would have loved to share this memorable series with my deaf wife."
3,Bill Cosby,I am a huge Cosby fan. I love all his work. I was a little disappointed in this though. I had never seen these shows and I was expecting it to be humorous and it wasn't. It's a nice clean family show and it's cute but not funny.
3,We all get older.,"Product is fine, basic tv material, no extras - all good. Bill Cosby is a wonderfully talented and funny man. Grew up listening to vinyl and tapes of his comedy. ""To my brother Russell"" ""Fat Albert"" etc. Am happy with the ""Best of "" I got, but am glad I didn't get the entire series. The bloke is still funny but we all get older, and tastes and humour change. Good stuff for the devotee but this stuff seems really dated and lame now."
4,Shows How,"I purchased this item as a gift for a carpenter, and I know that he enjoyed watching it and approved of the garage-constructing methods."
5,This book does bridge the gap between college & making money,"I got this book through my college course as a supplemental text and it was as valuable to me as anything I learned at college (I don't want to offend my instructors, but, they had nothing over this book). It actually teaches you how to get out there and get the interior design project, how to compete with all types of competitors, how to avoid the many mistakes that eat up your profits, it is a window treatment bible. I know I would have gave up and quit had I not started using some of the low-cost marketing and customer psychology ideas. It's the difference in completely wasting your time on ""free"" estimates. Now, I'm turning each appointment into a ""game"" that I am winning and really having fun with my business."
1,Secrets of Success for Today's Interior Designers and Decor.,"Within the last year my partner and I started a custom home decor sewing business. We have found this book indispensible as a guide in dealing with customers, and in considering what is involved in giving an estimate, and in creating window treatments, slipcovers, etc to their satisfaction. Following the advice in this book has helped us avoid problems we might otherwise not have considered. Very practical help."
5,Global Economis Integration,"As a student of International Integration, I found this book very interesting and informative in describing the links and the commonality between different global integration processes. For sure after reading the combined essays supporters of integration will reconsider their views on the subject. Is integration a good process? Does it take away from a nations national and political sovereignty? Excellent book I recommend it highly"
2,Quite a boring read,"Well this is the third book I've read authored by Shaun Hutson and regrettably he doesn't get any better.I would essentially agree, with other reviewers where they say the ending was unimaginative and rushed.Perhaps he could salvage this book by a sequal or similar. Anyway, best described as an adult comic .The first, 'Compulsion' was by far the best of the three, but that too, was less than inspiring.I notice Shaun is cast as a writer of Thriller and Horror material ? A thriller writer, I suppose.A writer of Horror...yawn !"
3,"Fun, though not taken from Cabin Fever restorations.","Of course, the content is amazing. No one since has gotten performances out of kids like you'll find on these shorts. Word of warning, they're racist as hell... well as racist as people were in the 20s and 30s, which is... very. Also, until later years, these didn't have much of a plot or story. Mostly some cute kids getting forced into weird situations and filmed with a few slapstick moments.The quality on the other hand... not so good. Audio is sometimes very hard to understand, and I'm not just talking about Buckwheat. Someone said these were taken from the Cabin Fever restorations... that is a lie. I have a few of those on VHS and they're another world of quality. Sadly, they're gone and hard to find. So if you're looking to get the Our Gang comedies for a decent price, I guess this series is pretty good, but it's no ""Cabin Fever"" for cheap."
3,I have tried two recipes and they are not good,"I tried ""FIVE POINTS HOME FRIES"". It is too hot.I tried ""RED CABBAGE SLAW"". It is too sour and strong onion smell. I can't eat them.I am going to others later."
2,I should have bought a burger!,"I was going to get some lunch. Instead, I ordered this book and ate left-overs before going back to work. The book came in the mail and the excitement of wondering what insight it may afford was lost when it read like a bathroom time killer. The information is out of date and not very accurate at all. Again, FEAR keeps the consumer buying this one."
5,Detailed Description-Meishi Street,"MEISHI STREET (Mei Shi Jie) shows ordinary citizens taking a stand against the planned destruction of their homes for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.In order to widen traffic routes for the Olympic Games, the Beijing Municipal Government orders the demolition of entire neighborhoods. Several evictees of Meishi Street, located next to Tiananmen Square, fight through endless red tape and the indifference of fellow citizens for the right to keep their homes. Given video cameras by the filmmakers, they shoot exclusive footage of the eviction process, adding vivid intimacy to their story.Acclaimed at over two dozen museums and galleries around the world, MEISHI STREET, by renowned visual artist Ou Ning, works as both art and activism, calling worldwide attention to lives being demolished in the name of progress.Other Formats on Amazon:DVD (Institutional) -Meishi Street (Institutional Use)VOD-to-Purchase (Institutional) -Meishi Street (Institutional Use)"
2,Wrong item,"This photo program looked, at the outset description to be the program I originally had, but it was not and I didn't even bother to download it. Bad purchase."
2,"in the same category as Psychics, ESP, and Scientology","This book is over-hyped by people who should know better. It supposedly proves that you can tell the truth of something by how much resistance your body puts up (""applied kinesiology"") when someone asks you a yes or no question. They say ""are you hungry?"" and try to push your arm down, and if it holds firm, that means, ""yes, time to eat."" If your muscles react weakly and your arm falls to your side, that means ""dude, I'm stuffed."" What?!Does that sound plausible? No. Common sense says, ""this is ridiculous."" That is because it is. This is pseudo-science, a waste of time, and not even interesting from the perspective of ""hmm some people believe this crap?""I was going to sell mine back to Amazon, but instead I thought, ""this book is taking advantage of the weak-minded"" and I tossed it in the trash."
2,It should be a new book and came used!,I was sure I picked a new book and I was suprised when I saw used book!!!I will keep it but my goal was to make this book as a gift. I had to buy second one in book store!
1,Another BS book,This book is nor serious nor coherent . If you are serious at study in human behavior refer to a psychologist book
2,I'm not sure I 'get' it...,"'P vs F' has a wealth of universal truths about human perception, but after I finished it, I felt right back where I started...""Our vision of consciousness is linked with our concept of self. The more limited the sense of self, the smaller the parameter of experiencing"".....You can't argue with that, but but so what?"
5,Love is So Much Stronger Than Hate!,"(by the author of Cancer As Initiation: Surviving the Fire) Grasping the concepts Hawkins presents in this book has changed my life in many ways. Just reading it lifts the spirit because of the hope it brings for humankind to reach higher levels of spiritual development. Learning to muscle test ideas and decisions for their value on his Map of Consciousness shows how beneficial or destructive something will be, thereby greatly increasing one's discernment. Understanding the true strength of power versus the unstable base of force fills one with hope for the future of humanity."
3,Good for keeping hair out of eyes,"My wife tried this to keep her hair out of her eyes while scuba diving. It worked for that purpose, but this is definitely a youth size and is way too tight for adults."
5,W. the first 100 days,D.B. Gilles and Sheldon Woodbury did a fantastic job!! The humor is constant and on most of the pages I laughed out loud!
5,I savored every minute!,"A delicious seduction between a prince and an uncommon commoner! If you've ever had a fantasy about meeting the prince of your dreams, this is the book for you! From the mysterious shores of an island paradise, to the steamy love scenes, this book is highly recommended for all romance fans...and for anyone ready to take a chance on romance."
2,From Back Cover,"Crown Prince Alexander Thorne's honorable intentions were overturned when he rescued a red-haired siren from the seas and gave in to the chemistry raging between them. Alex had sworn he would never again be ruled by a woman, yet lovely Sophia Dunhill might be carrying his heir, and duty required she be kept very close at hand.Sophia valued her freedom and had no intention of remaining in Prince Alex's island kingdom for longer than it took to repair her boat - royal command or no. Despite his fiery kisses and their heated nights, Sophia wanted more. Could her love transform her duty-bound prince into a man ruled by his passions?3rd in trilogy"

CreditsBONUS FEATURES--an AUDIO COMMENTARY by John Mayer (revealing the many facets of himself and his music._--Any Given Soundcheck--The Next Morning--Photo Gallery"
5,the performance that made me a fan,and almost everything I have heard from JM after it was even more amazing. He's truly becoming a guitar legend.
1,Never Again,"After reading a few reviews I bought this DVD. Never again.The picture is OK but the audio mix is NOT. The music was a very poor mix and the vocals were terrible. I could not understand what he was singing about.As far as having to watch John eating his microphone, it made me feel sick. Why take so many close-ups of his mouth?He is obviously very talented but has been sold short by the technical bods.No more antiquated 4.3. Widescreen for all releases please."
3,"Stand back from the mic, John.","I'm barely giving this 3 stars because I REALLY like John Mayer. This DVD grew on me at the same time I realized that he is eating the microphone. I know that other reviewers have mentioned this but it's worth pointing out again. Why dwell on the negative? Well, I bought this DVD because I knew it would sound better than the CD. I was wrong. It's almost worse. The constant slobbering and ""cha's, che's, cho's"" make it sound like he's under water some of the time.Mr.Mayer has admitted that one of the things he'd like to change, is the way he presents himself on stage as far as mannerisms and so forth. He should have started before this show was recorded.Reccomended for die-hard John Mayer fans only."
1,Great talent ... lousy sound track,"John Mayer is clearly a talented and passionate writer and singer, but he needs a new sound engineer. The crowd noise on this DVD is flawlessly reproduced, but the band and the vocals are terrible. I have a growing collection of music DVD's ... would much rather watch a concert for the tenth time than a movie. This one will sit on the shelf."
5,John Mayer loves music and it shows,Enormous talent. Here you can see guitar genius at work. I enjoy watching this again and again for its entertainment quality. John Mayer sings with sincerity and conviction. Superb guitar mastery. Quite hilarious commentary included by John himself.
4,Pretty Good,"The music sounds good, and production on the DVD was done well. The only complaint I have is that John makes lots of goofy faces and doesn't seem to have the professional stage presence of someone like Harry Connick Jr or Diana Krall."
3,"Entertaining, but probably not in the way he meant","My dad bought this DVD for me, knowing that I'm a John Mayer fan, and he's kind of one too. Don't get me wrong, I love John Mayer and his music but... watching the DVD was too funny. His expressions when he sang, lol he looked like he was in pain! He sure can make weird shapes with his mouth. =P And as my dad puts it, ""he eats the microphone"" while he sings. My mom said you should just watch it from the neck down. (to watch his guitar playing) The music though, is awesome! I loved how he added parts to songs that we all know by heart. Keeps things more interesting, you know?So all in all, I would recommend this to any John Mayer fan, or even if you're not one!"
2,"Great sound, great talent. Too bad he can't sing","I hardly understood a word he said. This new style of gutteral singing does someone like John Mayer a great disservice, because otherwise they sound great. Enunciate and take singing lessons, maybe you'll last."
3,Good Laptop,"Great laptop, arrived a bit damaged with the battery not fit exactly to the size of the connector, however not relay noticeable. works and runs great, CD drive is not a SATA, but the hard drive is a SATA hard drive, so you can swap out the one that come with it with an ssd if you choose."
4,Works fine,I received my t60 thinkpad on time; so far (3 mths) the laptop works fine; it came with 1GB of ram; soon I will add a 2 GB bar myself.
2,Too little information,"This may be a great ring -- it got me looking. But there is way too little product information, especially for the price!"
5,Lovely Salt,"Yes, this salt is lovely. It makes me feel like a ""real"" cook when I use it. Excellent price. So happy I ordered it. You will be too."
5,Very satisfied,I purchased the DVD to show my advanced Spanish students who were studying the works of Sor Juana. We all enjoyed the movie and learned a great deal about this great woman's life. I received the product in a timely manner and would be happy to do business again.
5,"Lush, Sad . . . Wonderful","If ever there was a movie to see--this is definitely it. If you can get over your initial disgust at the pornographic misrepresentation, which is an insult to the woman whose life inspired this film, you will blissfuly experience the brilliance that is the beauty of Sor Juana. This movie is without doubt the most moving and accurate portrayal I have ever seen in biographical films to date. The end was so moving (we--the Spanish class) were literally sobbing. ""Su sangre fue nuestros sangre"". As delicate as a Raphaelite painting and as bold as a Rodan sculpture, this depiction will leave you breathless at the fiery soul who was ""The Tenth Muse of Mexico""."
3,Good But Could Be Better,"If you want T and A then this is the video for you. Lots of hot chicks and lots of nudity. My only complaint is that the hottest chick, Tylene Buck aka Major Gunns, does NOT get naked. What's up with that? Otherwise its a nice T and A video."
3,Video could have been more accurate!,"The video could have been better if it included more information and footage from the past. It seems to concentrate too much on the past couple of years. The makers of this video would have viewers believe that the rivalry between the Red Sox and Yankees began with the sale of Babe Ruth. If they had done some research, they would have known that the rivalry extends back further. The Sox and Yankees have battled each other since the early 1900s. The Red Sox were the first team to play at Yankee Stadium against the Yankees and the Yankees were the first to play at Fenway Park in April 1912. The rivalry extends back to the competition between the two east coast cities which goes back to the 1800s. The video skims over the fact that the Yankees of the 1920s built many of their early championships by acquiring key players and a manager from the Red Sox organization."
4,history??,"was a good dvd, but couldve touched more on the rivalry from the past. just briefly hinted about the brawls from the 70's, and the remaining 40-45 minutes of it was mainly focused from 2003-2006."
2,Disappointing,"Although this is the best rivalry in sports, it has been one-sided over the years. So, I think they went overboard covering the one real success the Red Sox have had--2004. Seems like half the video was about that one series.Would've liked to have seen more coverage prior to 1996. Got glimpses of the 70's, including the '78 Playoff, but that was about it. Even footage of exciting in-season games would've been great."
2,Authentic but 78 recording quality,"The Gardel music is authentic in every way but since it has been recorded and remastered from old 78 records, the sound quality is poor and is a representation of the music sounds from that era. If you are looking for that full fledged orchestrated version of Carlos's tangos such as heard at the end of the True Lies movie, it is best to keep searching for a more recent recording."
3,great classic,The sound quality wasn't great and I don't apreciate this gender. Anyhow I bought this CD for my grandmother and she made a stroll into the good old days
3,Not worth more than $30,"This is a nice item, but on the screen it looks nicer than it actually is; it's very lightweight and almost feels plastic-y. I like it and found a nice place for it, but there is no way the original price should be over $200, that is bogus."
3,poop patrol,This is my first poop patrol. Works ok but I think a rake type poop tool would be better than the flat solid type that comes with it. ?????????????????
5,I love it!,I wish I had bought this years ago. I have my two dogs and chickens that free range in my yard. This pooper scooper has been a blessing to my bad back. I no longer have to bend over to pick up doo-doo. It's perfect for cleaning up after the chickens and I also use it for the dog's waste. I am very happy with the quality of this product.
2,Not worth it.,Product did not withstand cold temperatures even when being stored in a shed. Only lasted a few month before the plastic gave way from the pole. Highly suggest finding an all metal option.
4,Pick up the Poopy!,"Is a poopy scooper just a poopy scooper? Apparently not. Over the last few years we have tried several and they lasted less than a year. Springs would brake, plastic handles would break, many would hurt your hands just using them.I saw my neighbor using his and he never seemed to have a problem, at least the problems we were having. This scooper saves time, energy, wear and tear on yourself, and is clearly the way to go when it comes to your pet. This terrible job will seem to be a fresh breeze compared to others."
4,Good for sensitive pet owners,Even my 14 year old feels good using this setup to clean up after her puppy. The farther away from the business the better and this keeps her at an arms length.
4,"Does what it's meant to ""doo""","My 10-year-old, whose job is to pick up the dog doo, begged me to buy one of those claw-type picker-uppers where you squeeze the handle and the jaws grab the poop. I did, but forgot I'd already ordered this. I was going to return it, but my son started using it and guess what? He has abandoned the ""jaws of life"" picker upper for this useful tool. The best quality of this scooper is that it can handle quite a load of dog-droppings--we can pile our English Bulldog's entire day's output onto this without any falling off. It's easy to use the small scooper to coax the dung onto the bigger spade (even a 10-year-old can do it). And it saves you multiple trips from the yard to the trash bin and back. Some reviews made this sound flimsy, and it's not like it's made of solid steel, but it's perfectly sturdy and rinses off well with the hose. (Now, if I could only return that claw-thing to Petco...)"
4,Easy and convinient...converts my jump drive into mp3 player,"It is a pretty good deal for converting my jump drive into a mp3 player for a low cost. It is easy and convinient to use. So far, I only have it for a few days but I like it so far. The only cons is that is is made of plastic that looks like it is pretty fragile. The menu control is also limited and the play list is set by the sequence you put in the songs. But overall can't complain."
1,Poorly made,"I really liked the idea of this MP3 player, and you can't beat the price. However, I've encountered the same manufacturing defect twice. I originally ordered a JumpGear player from TigerDirect through Amazon. It came with a loose connection in the headphone port so that the slightest movement causes the sound to cut in and out of the left headphone. I immediately returned the player, but thought I would give the Lexar player one more try since it was so inexpensive. This time I ordered directly from Amazon, and it just arrived today. Exact same problem as the other one. I tried adjusting the jack to every possible position, and using a differen set of ear buds. I can get both headphones to work, but only if the player remains completely still.I think Lexar has designed a good product; it's unfortunate that they haven't bothered to make sure it is made well."
1,Poor Quality Hardware,What a nice idea -- and I *do* like my JumpDrive USB memory. But the JumpDrive Sport I ordered had problems right out of the box. The volume/navigation toggle switch didn't work well (couldn't consistently adjust the volume) and within a couple minutes failed entirely. Back it goes for a refund... Darn. For the few minutes that it worked the music sounded pretty good.
3,"Great concept, needs polishing.","It's wonderfully easy to load MP3s onto this and it plays nicely. I've had two problems:1. The display read Insert JumpDrive when the JumpDrive was firmly in place. After reformatting, this problem went away.2. I use mine to listen to audiobooks, in increments of about 30 minutes. Ideally I'd like to load up a couple hours of audio and start each time from where I left off. The JumpGear does not remember where it left off, neither the position in a track nor the track number."
3,Broke after 8 months of use,"Great idea. Beats paying stupid money for an iPod, that's for sure. I wish it was slightly higher quality and built to last. I also wish they'd update the firmware and add some new features. Like I said though, mine broke after 8 months of limited use (one set of batteries, only) and is going back to Lexar for replacement. They gave an RMA. We'll see how that goes."
2,You get what you pay for,I thought I was getting a great deal considering I didn't have to pay gor the 1G jump drive(work provided). The first player I got broke within 2 weeks. The earphone jack completey fell into the player. So amazon gets me another out right away and now it's not reading the jump drive correctley. I'm gonna try to reformat it but it looks like I could be sending it back again. The company needs to do a better job with this.
2,Limited to only Lexar Spot drives - will not work with other media,"I have a whole pile of USB key drives, they are often given out free at trade shows. This MP3 player is a great idea - it lets you use your USB keys like you would a cassette or a CD in days of old. Just make up different keys to suit your listening tastes.The problem is that Lexar locked this product down so it only works with the JumpDrive Sport. It doesn't work with any other manufacturers. It doesn't even work with other Lexar USB drives. So as a result, it turns a product which could be a low-cost killer product into something kind of useless in the long run.If you've bought one of these, stock up on a few JumpDrive Sports while they are still made. USB keys do not last forever - the bits on them physically wear out over time."
1,Incompatible,"The Jumpgear *only* works with Lexar Jumpdrives. Lexar made the software to reject other USB drives, even if they fit in the player. Lame."
2,"Disappointing, inexpensive device","After using it for 3-4 hours, I think I made a mistake.Pros:Drag-and-drop is slick and easyDual puropse (w/the JumpDrive on my keyring)Small form factorStandard batteries (not proprietary)Cons:Volume not loud enough (have to re-process mp3s before I load them)Earbuds are low, low qualitySound quality is marginal, even at 320Kbps w/good phones (or on my Bose system)Navigation is confusing at best, silly at worstIt does not remember the last song it played - starts at the beginning of the playlist on power-up.Needs clip, pouch, lanyard, etc.I wish I'd have paid a little/lot more for another brand of MP3 player. It's a decent stop-gap solution if you need something very economical and already have a JumpDrive Sport. It's a lousy solution, in my opinion, if it is going to be your only/primary MP3 player."
3,Good player,"This is a good player with nice features. It fits into the palm of the hands but the buttons feel awkward to use while holding it. Even though we were really impressed with it when we first got it, it seems designed to break after a short time. Handy people will be able to solder the piece that breaks though to extend its use. My husband said most of the soldering work looked good except for on one piece. Other reviewers have complained about the same piece breaking. I think it took about 3 months for the piece to break on ours, but after fixing it, it has been working for over a year. Don't get it unless you feel comfortable with opening it up and doing some soldering work on it."
4,Great little entry mp3 player,"This little player is great for the money. Downside is you need the Lexar Jump Drive to store the music on. But for the money, its a great option."
5,Very good value for your money,"I bought this mp3 player for my wife together with Lexar JumpDrive and she loves it!!!!... one of its best features is the flexibility of using the flash memory for both moving normal files and loading mp3's which she can then listen to in the Jump Gear... the only thing that it misses is a clip so that it can be straped to the pants while walking/jogging... anyway, these two make a great couple."
3,It nullifies its best feature,"I was looking for a battery operated MP3 player that had the max storage that I could get. Non-batteried players require a wall source to power up, which for travelers/hikers/distance people is not readily available. Using the player with a 1 gig Jumpdrive, I had the kind of storage I needed to put a huge amount of songs in my pocket.Unfortunately, the larger the capacity, the more its main drawback stands out. 200 to 400 songs is nice, but if you have to remember which one you played last in order to skip forward to it every time the unit is powered up . . . much too primative for the market today. Best for 24 hours of sea shores, rivers or rain storms, but not albums.Otherwise, good sound, sturdy construction, and long battery life. I really wish I could give this player 5 stars, but if you keep a pencil and notepad handy you'll enjoy using it."
1,"a cute idea, but don't bother","When I started using Lexar Jumpdrives, I picked this up, thinking it would be neat to be able to use as an MP3 player. It does have a decent display, which made it nicer than what I had before, and of course you get limitless storage space - just buy more Lexar Jumpdrives (which I think are great).However, there are some problems. First, despite following the directions, I have never been able to get this to work properly when I write music files from my Mac. Also, in the intervening two years, cheaper and better MP3 players have made this pointless. The new iPod shuffle (admittedly, no screen) is smaller, lighter, runs much longer, has a built in rechargeable battery, and is about the same price (assuming you buy this accessory and a 1GB Lexar jumpdrive)."
4,I love it,"I bough this one for a while i could buy a nice iPod and i have had it for more than one year, it is more practical than my iPod, i love it because i am not superconcern if i drop it (it is very resistent but also very very light), i place it in my pocket of my pants or in my cell phone pocket, in my wallet or my purse and it is not heavy at all, it goes very good. The sound is not as good as an apple iPod, but it is still very very good. Bateries last fairly and the price is wonderful. What i really like more than anything else is that i can take information or music to and from my mac or my pc and it is very easy to handle, i can take or drop music from one computer to another very easly as i can not do it with my iPod. I have the quantity of music that i decide depending on what flash drive i am bringing with me. The manual is useless... but you will learn by yourself"
5,"In This Price Range, It has No Peer","I've had my Lexar Jumpgear for about a year. It sounds surprisingly good considering the price. As for durability, again, I've had mine for a year. Advantages of this unit are...If you already have a Lexar jumpdrive sport, you can get a MP3 player for under $40.No annoying DRM crapola to prevent you from listening to your musicDoesn't require some dubious proprietary interface in order to transfer music files from your computer.Isn't limited to any particular operating system. You can drag and drop files from whichever file manager you use. You can even do it at the command line (shell) if that is your wont.It is very good for exercising and such. Since it's a flash drive, you don't have to worry about jostling it around. Also, it's only $40, so you don't have to be paranoid about it.You can easily switch 1 gigabyte jumpdrives, assuming you have more than one, and have a different music catalogs for different occasions or different people sharing the same player."
5,Solid DVD,"Although the animation isn't exactly top of the line, it was still able to draw me in. The story is very intricate, hope it continues to deliver. Although it lacks any significant plot twists yet, this is only the second volume. This particular volume reminded me a little of Rurouni Kenshin, in which the main character will fight, but he does not believe in taking a life. It is also hinted that the road which the character is on will not be an easy one. While the English voice acting is good, lately I find that watching it in Japanese with subtitles draws one into the story more deeply. Overall, was solid DVD and look forward to the Volume 3 release in april."
3,light switch plate,i was not aware the plate was papered on and not permanent. It pealed away as I was screwing the plate on.
5,MP3 downloads,why can't you get this on MP3 download? ... along with many CDs by Henry Fiol??So many great artists in the Latin community are not included!
4,Hours of fun!!!,"bought this for my niece for her b-day, and she loved it. great birthday gift for little ones!"
3,really great until we lost all the magnets,"really a cute, fun, educational little puzzle. We lost the magnets almost immediatly, and now its pointless."
3,A little disjointed,"While most of what you need to know about CDO programming is in this book, I found that the information could have been presented in a more friendly manner. Most of the examples seem to be spread out throughout several chapters, leaving you to do a lot of flipping back and forth to figure out fairly straight forward information. Quite frustrating. To be fair to the authors, I have found this to be the case with most of the books in the WROX library, so it is probably just the editorial style of the publishing company.If you like the WROX style, you should be happy with this book."
4,comment to other reviewer,"If you are going to comment on someone else's poor translations, try learning some proper English. ""Waist"" in this context should be ""waste."" As in ""Your review is a complete waste of my time.""As for the book, well written and interesting if you can read at a high level. All Suny series are academic."
5,Talk of Town still something to talk about,"Here is another fine example of the snappy patter, intelligent repartee, and clever scripting which made movie-watching a joy. This treasure holds up after nearly seventy years; and why not? ""Talk of the Town"" has a plot which never sags and is handled by a cast of superb headliners and incomparable character actors. Imagine: no foul words or indelicate gesturing, scatological references, or low-brow ha-ha's, and characters with various sides to their natures. At least for one, this delight has been dormant on some ill-remembered shelf and deepest thanks is owed to all who brought this gem back to life."
3,3 great actors & a great director sometimes only equals an ok movie,"its always nice to realize that even at my advanced age there are still cary grant movies i havent seen. the problem here is that he is the distinctly less interesting male in the riomantic triangle with jean arthur and ronald colman. matter of fact, the most interesting relationship is between grant and colman, but being that it IS cary grant after all, he has to get the girl. the politics also beg the question quite a bit, as the movie never seems to want to make up its mind. still, worth watching for the 3 terrific leads as well as a great supporting turn from edgar ""uncle joe"" buchanan."
4,Enjoyable!,I like to watch Cary Grant movies and The Talk Of The Town may not be his best movie but it is good and enjoyable! Cary Grant is very good and so are Ronald Colman and Jean Arthur!
1,wrong attribution,"If you want to hang this picture in your living room with pride, you should cross out Andy Warhol's name and write Marshall McLuhan. He's the one that coined the phrase ""art is what you can get away with""."
4,very good,excelent dvd. very illustrative and educative. i learn a lot seeing it!!!And the price is correct too. thank you!
5,My favorite paper towel - select a size,"This is a great paper towel if only because of the form factor. Ripping off a smaller size is far more useful for most uses. Strong, too."
5,"Without a doubt, the best paper towel!","I've tried them all, and Bounty is the best! Add the select-a-size feature and you can quickly divide the sheets up for jobs big and small. From everything from personal use to heavy-duty household scrubbing, you can't go wrong with this brand of towel."
5,Will soak up everything,"Known as the quilted, quicker picker-upper, paper towels do not get any better than this fine Bounty product. Bounty's exclusive ""Select-a-Size"" is very convenient in helping you get just the size of towel you need for any job. To top it all off, Bounty paper towels are super absorbent, absorbing faster than any other paper towel on the market. Forget Brawny with its hunky ""Brawny-man"" gimmick. Go for the real thing, Bounty!"
3,Just ok,I expected them to be individually wrapped and they weren't. So it was just ok for the money
1,Bount-i-ful RIP OFF!,"The sheets are 45% smaller than a normal sheet, which sounds good unless you actually think about it. 45% smaller means that each select-a-size sheet is a normal sheet minus 45% (ie. the select-a-size sheets are bigger than half of a regular sheet). If you held 2 select-a-size sheets on top of 1 regular sheet, the 2 select-a-size sheets would be larger than the regular sheet by 10%. Just think, for those pesky little spills you can conveniently throw away 5% of your money with each tear of the select-a-size paper towel roll."
4,good handles,"better than anything they had at Lowe's. They match the rest of the hardware in my kitchen. They fit the valve a little loose, but the valve is kind of wimpy. Very easy to install and they look nice too."
1,Focus is on faith not autism,I was looking for a story of a family dealing with autism. This book does not focus on the autism. The focus is on the family's faith while dealing with a child with a disability not the disability itself. This book barely even tells of the autism or live with autism. The book shows how the family turns to faith and how this faith is present in every aspect of their lives. This book was far to spiritual for my liking. I do not recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about autism. I felt it was a waste of my time. I personally would seek spiritual guidance elsewhere as well.
3,not that easy,"very academic, hard to read, English is my se4cond language, always though i did ok but wow. do like the fact that Nietzsche has a section though"
4,watch,"i am a 19 year old female. i purchased this watch for nursing school bc i liked that it has all the numbers, dashes for seconds and a second hand. warning to buyers that think this is a boys watch bc it most defiantly is not. the nike swoosh and numbers are pink. anyone worried about size i have about a 6 and a 1/2 inch wrist and it fits my wrist just fine. the quality and comfort of the watch is fab...but i am worried about scratching the face of it due to the fact that the glass is raised above the edges so it is susceptible to scratching although i wore it all week and there are no scratches on it yet. overall for the price i paid 14.95...i think it was well worth it and i do love the looks of it."
1,Wrong quality and color,"I bought three watches.I didn't receive the watches that I assumed I would have. The ones showed on the picture are gray color, and the ones I received are pink.Later, one of them just failed."
3,Decent product,"I got this because it was good price and its works as intended. Not much can be said, it’s a screen saver."
3,Worked Great,"For whats its worth, this item worked great on my Q when I used it. No longer have a Q, but I also forgot to rate this item."
3,You need a magnifying glass to read the instructions...,"Ok, now that I understand how to attach the guard, the instructions need a magnifying glass. The package comes with the screen guard sandwiched between two protectors, a lint cloth, and a squeegee.Each of the protectors has an adhesive tab, so you peel one off using the adhesive tab to reveal the sticky side of the screen guard, apply that to the phone, and THEN peel off the TOP plastic protector using the second tab. That leaves the REAL screen guard in place.Other than that, it seems to work. (uh, the guard is not scratch resistant, and tends to look ""oily"" when cleaned.)"
2,Questionable quality,"It looked nice when it first arrived, but in just a few weeks some paint started peeling off. For that much money I expected more."
5,letters and sounds,This is another great book in the Dellosa series. It makes learning letters and their sounds easy and fun.
3,In depth but sometimes dull and complicated,"I learned a lot from the book around project management tecniques and how to's, however, there were time I could not follow and had to put the book down. Stakeholder involvement, planning processes and other sections were well developed but others seemed to be overly complicated."
5,Soda Fountain and ice cream fun,"This 1973 book traces the history of ice cream from its roots to today. It features the early street vendors that sold ice cream including the Good Humor Man, and Eskimo Pie. It has the history of soda fountains and soda jerks. And it also has the lingo that soda jerks used, a dictionary of sorts, including such phrases as ""City Juice"" (water), ""bucket of hail"" (glass of ice"", or a ""George Eddy"" (non-tipping customer). And then it has recipes for tons of great treats. Really a fun book for fans of old soda fountains. Its a big book at 206 pages, hardback with colorful dustjacket. I posted a picture of the jacket above."
2,Softcore romance,"This was a pretty mild example of late-night, softcore porn with more involved stories. It has kind of a cute premise; Marilyn Chambers invites women over to try on lingerie. Naturally, the conversation turns to sexual conquests of the past, with flashbacks to those conquests. The sex is fairly tame, and the acting poor, but the women are attractive, albeit a bit older and softer than usual. Overall, some nice visuals, and the story elements might appeal more to women than most softcore stuff, but even so the stories are really kind of lame, and the character build-up nearly nonexistant. Another tribute to Marilyn Chambers isn't a bad thing, though, just as long as you know what you're getting into."
5,Works great,"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Camille Grammer leading blonde of the platinum-bombshell variety, long-legged Camille Donatacci is an actress with an entirely enticing list of credits. Armed with the knowledge that long, lean legs often lead up to elevated, compact chair cushions. Marilyn Chambers' Bedtime Stories (1993) was before Camille married Kelsey Grammer in 1997.Marilyn Chambers' Bedtime Stories finds the former Ivory Snow box model, hardcore hippie, and softcore tease getting her girlfriends together for a lingerie party. It's the best kind of lingerie party, one that involves very little lingerie. Of the big plastic boobs that join Marilyn for some naked fun, most familiar to a mainstream audience is Kelsey Grammer squeeze Camille Donatacci in her nude debut."
4,Lullaby,This is a great CD with selections very well rendered by different Windam Hill Artists. Relaxing music for any afternoon or evening.
4,kazoo!!!,"Cl is a very known group here in Portugal. Their cool and jazzy songs are very good and moody. Not very known in other countries, but you should listen to it. It is a great album. You can notice that the tracks have specific part, they are not placed like this in a random order, this is a sign of how good they are, and all of them are great, solid, and very well played.Great songs and a great feeling of happiness. It is unfairly that a great group like this is not so known. Buy iy, I know you wont regret!!!"
1,Fake Version,"Bought this product, it is great, works almost like the real deal! But it is totally fake , made in singapore! Before buying any softwear online make sure its authentic so you can receive your updates."
1,Still waiting for a NEW copy of CS3!,"Just installed my second copy of CS3 after Amazon sent me the upgrade disc by mistake. Contacted support at Adobe after the first install to make sure it wasn't a software glitch and they assured me the serial number indicates Amazon sent the wrong software. I actually can't see anywhere on the box or DVD case any mention of whether it's a new or upgrade copy and only found out when I got to the registration dialogue box. To my GREAT DISMAY, my newly installed second CS3 copy from Amazon is ANOTHER upgrade disc. C'mon guys!! I love shopping here but you've forced me to do yet another return and this time I'm taking my $600+ elsewhere."
5,Photoshop CS3,"The product is great, but the official Adobe customer service is lacking. It is based in India. I like the new fiber filter and brushes."
1,"Horrible Product - NEW meant USED, with BLANK software CDs enclosed.","Ordered Adobe Photoshop CS3 - received today, Friday 2/22/2008.The box was wrapped like new, but when I opened it, the discs were all SCRATCHED - Definitely not a NEW, UNOPENED SOFTWARE PACKAGE.When I inserted the discs, they wouldn't even READ. So I took them to be scanned for viruses, etc., and it turns out the discs were BLANK - nothing on them, with an Adobe label on it. Horrible. I will never buy from this seller again.The box did not even come with any SOFTWARE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS. ODD.A FULL refund and coverage for all return shipping charges is necessary. Please contact me ASAP about this matter."
1,Never got it!!!,"I never received the item, I tried to contact this seller about getting a refund and returning this item, but they never got back to me."
1,Unable to rate,"I am unable to write a review on this program because I never received my order. The order was through Amazon, but it was actually from No Limit Sales. Amazon however, was most helpful in trying to get my order and when it was several days past time for the last date of delivery, my purchase price was credited back to my account and I was free to place my order somewhere else."
3,"Great product, nightmarish activation system","It's pretty simple: if you're serious about photo editing, Photoshop is by far the best and most capable product out there. There are plenty of products that are good enough for casual use, but nothing matches Photoshop for raw power.Be aware, however, of the baggage that Adobe forces on you when you buy one of their products. They use an online activation system to prevent you from installing on too many computers at once, which is eminently reasonable. The activation system, however, is buggy and temperamental. For example, when I installed the SP1 upgrade to Vista (which every Vista user will need to do), the activation system thought I had moved Photoshop to a new computer, and locked up the software. I eventually ended up on the phone with customer support, who finally agreed to re-activate my software (but only after chastising me for not de-activating Photoshop before installing SP1 and re-activating it afterward)."
5,Adobe Photoshop CS3...Wow!,"Well, what would you expect from the industry standard in graphic manipulation? It is everything that you've come to expect and has become everything that you've ever wanted Photoshop to be! (Despite the price tag)It's perfect for professional graphic designers, professional Illustrators, professional Artists, professional Photographers, and Professional web Designers. The keyword is ""professional"", but don't let the word professional stop you. Afterall, it was probably Adobe Photoshop that gave those professionals the edge so they could become ""Professionals""! So even if, (especially if,) you're a novice of any of those professions, let Adobe Photoshop give you the edge so that you can take your rightful place amongst the other pros in your field. Unleash your creative side!Want the best? Buy the best. It's that simple. Aside from a nice sized price tag and a few hiccups in Vista, Photoshop CS3 is the choice of Professionals.John F Willis Illustrator/ Artist"
3,Mildly disappointing,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did.The cinematography, costuming, and sets are amazing for the budget this film had. I have absolutely no complaints there. It's beautiful.The acting was... acceptable. Very often, though, it felt like there were no acting coaches on staff and they only did a few read throughs before shooting. It lost a star in my estimation due to that. But, sadly, I've seen worse.The second star off came from the fact that I am a lover of Arthurian Lore. Except for the foreign invaders there is nothing movie has in common with true Arthuriana other than names."
2,An Epic Home Movie,"The Pendragon: Sward of His Father made for an interesting interpretation of Celtic Britain's history that might appeal to child audiences. That said, Chad Burns should've waited until he'd gained more experience with smaller projects before tackling a big one like this. The directing, cinematography, special effects, music, and costuming made for the stronger elements of the film. However, these couldn't rescue it from a poor script (rendering the main female character completely unconvincing), poor acting, and oversight regarding customs and manner of the time period. But probably the worst element was casting, which was obviously not conducted by an independent agency. A brother and sister playing opposite each other is kids' stuff in a home movie and highly improper for a feature film made for a Christian audience."
5,Great family film,"This is a great family-friendly movie. It's difficult to find movies that I can allow the children to watch without worrying about what they will see or hear, so I really appreciate the care that was taken with this one.Considering the film's budget and producers, Pendragon was wonderfully done and it is obvious that a ton of work was put into it. The plot is not too complicated for children to follow, but is interesting enough to keep adults' attention as well. You can tell that some of the actors are not experienced, but in a way, this rather adds to the innocence of the film. I feel this movie was a good purchase, and I recommend it for any family's movie night!"
1,Remarkably bad,"I bought this for my son. He could not finish the movie it is so banal. Terrible acting, bad script and badly directed. Do not waste your money."
3,Less info. than the last edition,"I live in Panama and have bought each of the Lonely Planet Panama books as they have come out. This edition seems to have less information than the last one. In my town, Volcán, there are about 10 places to sleep; six were listed in the previous edition, but just one in this book - and the one shown is an odd, out-of-the-way place offering large cabins for extended families.I wonder if I can trust Lonely Planet to give me the information I've come to trust them for. I will look at other guides more carefully as options to LP for my other travels."
2,left some things out,"I agreed with other reviews in the sense that it left out alot. Maybe it was to out of date like others had suggested. We backpacked through the stretch of the pacific side of panama in a few weeks. The book left out parts of places we found, cabanas on the beach and so forth and roads that were supposedly non existant. Panamanians were extremly nice and helpful. Other books could probably tell more."
1,Not a guide!,I agree with the previous comments here that this book is a less a guide and more of a 'I'll tell you how it is' type book. It is a GUIDE after all and I would expect to find some basic facts to get me around and certainly a few of recommendations but NOT the authors views and rants on certain subjects. I am going to the place to make up my own mind!I like the new style Lonely Planet guides and find them much easier to navigate than the old ones but I want a travel guide to assist me not a book full of the authors narrow opinions!In my view there are better guides to Panama on the market!
2,Not too impressed,"I've been a ""lonely planet"" traveller for quite some time, and have a whole bookshelf of their guides. However, Lonely Planet Panama was fairly inadequate. Luckily, we also purchased the Moon Handbook and were much more impressed with it. The LP guidebook was outdated, uninspired, inaccurate, and lacking significant detail. If you're heading to Panama, buy the Moon Guide instead."
3,Not Up to Par for Lonely Planet Guides,"In all fairness, the copy I have was published in 2004, so much of the pricing and other info is outdated. Nevertheless, I was disappointed in the overly-opinionated editorializing instead of useful and insightful traveller's facts that I expect from Lonely Planet guides. I think I will start giving a closer look to other travel pubs such as the Rough Guide series, which is a shame, as I have been a fan and loyal customer of LP since ""SE Asia on a Shoestring"" which was published the early 80s. This Panama guide needs updating, more detail and a cleansing of the overly-political content."
2,Not what I was looking for in a guide books,"The information that I need prior to traveling to a new country is the location of hotels, attractions and restaurants. The prices associated with the pertenant locations and suggestions on best deals.While the author has a few short suggestions with each hotel or restaurant he seems more intent upon making a political statement about the environment and the influence the U.S has had on Panamanian history.Let me decide if I want to eat a lobster for dinner and please keep your liberal bias to yourself.Give me the facts!"
2,Dont waster your money on this one,I found this book to be completely misleading. It is also very much out of date. The hotels and places to stay were at least 50-150 over what was written here. the reviews of the places were not accurate as well. I would absolutely read blogs for accurate info regarding travel here. We dont think we will ever purchase Lonely Planet books again because this book was so off target
2,Ridiculously out of date,"I normally love LP, but I can't believe they published this edition with so much out-of-date information. We wasted a LOT of time trying to find places that no longer existed or had moved. I would strongly urge against buying this book until they properly update it, unless you're just looking for general background information on the country."
4,Very useful,"I traveled in Panama for about 2 weeks using local transportation, and this book was really helpful. There is a lot of information and background about the culture and history of the country, too, which is nice. However, prices (hotels in particular) were not accurate (much higher!), but it gave us a reference point, especially for taxis.I recommend this book overall, especially if you are traveling by yourself."
1,LP Panama - do NOT buy until they update a new edition,"I previously had great experiences with LP books, but heard they are letting many of them go un-updated. Not sure if this is the case, but it definitely is with LP Panama. The info listed on Amazon shows it was last updated in '04 (which think means the info is more like '02/'03).We ended up leaving this book at home and took Moon (great details, especially helpful if doing any cross-country driving; believe a new edition is coming out later this year but found most of the info to still be relevant, especially if assume many of the prices for hotels had gone up) and buying Frommers (as of May '08 most updated)"
3,"There IS one thing, though...","I like this book and have already used some of the decorating ideas and recipes. However, be aware that there is a part of the book (pages 100 & 101) that explain to children how to read palms and encourage them to use a Ouija board! I read through this entire book while waiting for my children to get out of school and was horrified to find this ""subtle"" information posted deep inside the book. I can't tell you how upset I was to find something so random in a child's ""how to"" book about the holidays.I give it 4 stars, because 90% of the info in the book was acceptable."
2,Nice but don't like the buttons,This is a nice product but the buttons don't stay buttoned; would not order this brand again.
1,lightweight,"The description of this Union suit is ""medium weight"". The material is similar to a T-shirt. The buttonholes are useless, as they do not stay buttoned. I took the buttons off and attached a strip of velcro so that I am not falling out of them. If you are looking for warmth, these are very lightweight."
2,Not impressed,"We purchased this stand when we purchased the TV thinking that it would be nice to store our stereo components. However, not long after we had it put together the joints between the different pieces of the stand begin to strain and the stand was soon unusable because it was so unstable. We now use the TV without the stand and find that it's the perfect height."
4,The story continues,"Contains episodes 5-8Outside Romdo, a small colony of scavengers live. A disease kills most people who leave the city, but some manage to survive. Vince and Pino live with the colony for a short time. Re-l tries to get Vince to return to Romdo, but she falls prey to the disease. Re-l is returned to the city. We find out where babies come from. Daedelus tells Re-l a little bit about the ugly proxy, but he doesn't know much, apparently. Vince and Pino leave on the Rabbit, a wind-powered flying ship, heading to Mosk. On their journey, they end up in the middle of a battle between men and autoreivs. A third proxy, female and flying, appears. The joker-faced proxy appears. There's a fight. Guess who wins?War, what is it good for? Pino says, ""I don't get it."" Do you?"
4,If you hate Naomi...,"...you're gonna hate this, judging from the majority of opinions. If you love Naomi, you will certainly love her album. And if you don't care about Naomi at all and will listen to the songs without prejudice, you might find it's actually not bad. She can sing and her voice is nice, when she doesn't try to sound girly or go over the top. Nice average pop; I'm giving ****, because I bought this album when it first came out and keep returning to it from time to time - therefore I must admit I like it a little above average :)"
1,Not impressed in NY,"Please!!! Does this lady really think she can crossover into the music world? Her lyrics are egotistical bordering on the verge of being downright degrading to women. Much of what she tries to sing about is herself. Why would you want to pay that much money to hear her have to make a desperate attempt in singing for the purpose of trying to convince herself that she is something that she is not. If you want to listen to a great CD then buy anything by SADE. Not only can this women sing but her lyrics are down to earth. Naomi, you should have taken music lessons from U2 when you had the chance!!!"
5,Excellent album,"Naomi Campbell's only album babywoman is actually a very good album. The album which is a lite pop-r&b blend includes production that compliments Ms. Campbell delicate vocals but shows off HER delicate and seductive VOICE. Such a shame that the UK music press laughed at this because if a been a chart-topper than it would have seen the light of day stateside back in 1994. My favorite tracks (and the album's strong points) are Love & Tears, I Want to Live, Ride a White (which is a cover of the T-Rex song) Look Swank (Spooky), and Life of Leisure. The album weakest point would have to be the title track. Also worth mention is Picnic in the Rain and the Zoe cover Sunshine on a Rainy Day. Had Epic promoted this album properly and had the British press given her a chance Naomi would have had a very successful career in music."
1,"NO, NO, NO and once again NO...","I have never experienced such a horrible album in my whole life. There is only one good song ""Love and Tears""(that is why I bought it). The rest is just [bad]. Naomi can not sing. No! She really can't!! ..."
2,"It's not that serious, I never put that much...","Hi there,I never thought people would take this serious. When I accidentally came accross ""Baby Woman"" in a music store. It was in a pool that was holding ""unsold"" albums for a %90 off price. I got this cassette for less than 1$. App. 0.85 or less. I just listened to it once... That was all. Naomi deserves this. She can be tasted ONCE, than left outside alone... WHAT AN IRONY!!!!"
1,YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't waste precious minutes of your life on this rubbish! Instead pick up Sade's latest cd which produces not only great songs, but she has an incredible style for writing lyrics. The same thing happens to actors who try their hand at singing when their acting careers stall and 9 times out of 10, fall right on their face. Go back to the run-way Naomi."
5,Essential reading for all beginning PhD students,"Writing a PhD prospectus can be pretty intimidating. Where do you start? What do you include? What do you not include? This little book has the answers, and it has been an enormous help to me as I write my own proposal. Friedland and Folt's book is very clear and well-written, and full of practical information on how to write a clear, concise, and exciting proposal. Exercises along the way help to guide you step-by-step through the whole thought process. With this book in hand, writing a prospectus almost seems easy! This book should be sent to all first-year students, along with their registration materials."
4,Good overview of the content and organization of a proposal,"Friedland and Folt provide a very nice, concise guide to writing research proposals. They go over the organization of the proposal, what is important to get across in what sections, and also touch on the ""storytelling"" aspects, such as funneling from broad themes to specifics. I also found useful the list a range of funding sources.The only major drawback to the book as a general reference is that it is heavily oriented towards experimental biology. Much of the nuts-and-bolts advice doesn't apply to theoretical work, and little or no equivalent advice is given for theoretical proposals."
3,Ho Hum,"Not great, but not bad. Hasn't given me a whole lot of good tips or new ideas, but does tell me what to expect from the process of proposal writing and submission."
2,good picture book,i was disapointed with this book as i was expecting a book with info on training. this is a good picture book for kids nothing more.
2,"Great, unless you've got Windows XP","Many Hewlitt Packard Products do not work properly with Windows XP. Worse still, they have newly released many drivers that still don't work properly."
2,I got a Lemon!,"I have been using this MFC for over a year now and I'm not impressed. The print quality isn't bad, but every time I have to change a print cartridge, I have to spend about 45-minutes or more getting the machine to accept the new cartridge. It gets stuck on an error ""remove and check cartridge"", so I go through all the steps in the manual to clear the error and after about 15-attempts doing the exact same thing, it finally clears. Sometimes it gets the same error when I haven't changed the cartridge and I still have to spend about 45-minutes repeating those steps over and over. The other error message that finally lead to my having to replace it all together was ""Initializing"" It got stuck on that error code and there was nothing I could do to clear it. I checked the HP website for ideas and tried everything I could find, but nothing worked an I couldn't do anything except fax a document while it was stuck on that error, so I finally replaced it with a Brother product."
1,Disappointing,The tingle cream didn't tingle. The ediblelotion wasn't edible. The massage oil was thick and sticky. Wouldn't buy again. We have barely used these products since first trying them out.
1,unhappy customer,"These had the same problem as the 45 pc metric titanium set, the cutting threads were filled in with the metal that was cut out of the flutes. And some of the threads were nicked."
3,Good price decent quality,"This is a good option for a cheap stock replacement speaker. 5.25"" speaker offers little bass because of its size but delivers decent sound quality. Does not match a higher end speaker but is good for the price. I was disappointed that the illuminate light option requires second pair of wires run to power the light. I would recommend to anyone looking to get sound back in their car for very little money"
5,Shrewsbury strikes again!,"As a fan of this guys work I knew what to expect when I read the first page and I wasNOT disappointed. Once again in the grand, ferocious style reminiscent of Robert E.Howard Mr. Shrewsbury has created a great piece of work. The strength of the character,the historical details, the bloody trail he leaves as he makes his way through this adventureand of course a little sex thrown in is a great mix for an awesome adventure. This is definately a page turner, I could hardly put it down!Buy it NOW!"
4,Good Patrol Bag,"This is a great bag for police officers or anyone else who keeps equipment in their vehicle. Seems to be durable, I have had it holding various equipment and paperwork in my patrol car for about a year now and rummage through it everyday that I work. I have a take-home, but it would be great for cops that use fleet cars and have to move their stuff from car to car daily. Plenty of room for the essentials. Worth the $50 in my opinion."
5,Love this bag,"It has everything, and holds everything. You can leave the dividers in to stay organized or take them out for more space. Has a slot for an I.d. or name card, two Velcro loops for a baton or something like it. And a large Velcro patch on top for police, sheriff patch, or large name plate etc. This bag is an officer's dream."
2,ok i guess,"Bag is too ""baggy"" needs som rigid panels to keep its shape. The rings for maglite are too far apart. Well constructed though."
4,A Great Look at Chronic Pain,"Great read - I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the world of headaches, chronic pain, or the world of medicine. This is a memoir of Paula Kamen who one day got a headache. That never went away. She covers her trips to all sorts of specialists, traditional and non-traditional. Her questioning of self, medicine, and the headache. It gets a bit thick at times but I really enjoyed this read. All I can say is that in regards to chronic pain: ""She gets it!"""
5,A Book Every Doctor Should Have,"A friend of mine is a nurse working in a chronic pain ward in a major hospital. They get the cases where conventional doctors have given up. The patients typically have been through the ringer that Ms. Kamen describes, but often with a dependency on hard drugs as well. As Ms. Kamen says Western medicine has a strong tendency to depend on drugs over anything else.Ms. Kamen tells her story with wit, with honesty, and with a way of conveying information that I've never seen before. This book should be in every doctors office for the thankfully few that will need it. Those few, however, will need it very badly."
4,"All in my head, too","Kamen has written a well-researched and very timely book on chronic head pain, the medical and alternative approach to treating it, and societal reaction to its existence. Anyone with chronic pain or who knows someone with it should read this book."
1,Very unhappy with this product! Does not work right at all!,This item is a real lemon! Is this company for real? Would never order this brand again. Why would you even send such as item to anyone!
1,What a waste of money!,"Bought this a few months back and never used it until now. This thing works great as a sealer but horrible as a vacuum sealer, it doesn't suck out any air what-so-ever, which is the whole reason for this purchase! The bags that come with it are thinner than a ziplock bag, and the whole thing just feels cheap.... just like what i paid for it... I guess it can be a good $25 paperweight or a door stopper, but definitely not what it was advertised to do. Would rate it ZERO stars if I could. Buy at your own risk, i've already attempted to warn you."
1,don't waste money,This sealer never vacuum well and the seal always had spots that didn't seal. It's. Obvious to me Deni tried to undercut competitors price with no concern that the product works. Won't buy deni again.
1,crap,this item does not work the vaccumm mechanizm doesnt work. horrible product. I wouldnt recomend it maybe try a different model
1,Poor design,Unit would not seal properly. Returned for credit and replaced with a Foodsaver brand - which continues to work great after almost a year!
1,Deni Freshlock-poor quality-get what you pay for,"In using the deni freshlock unit with their bags I have found that you get what you pay for. Within 48hrs., I found air had made its way into the bags. tried it over and over same results. so much for vacuum sealing ."
1,Absolute Junk,"Bought it, it fell apart. Threw it in the garbage. Tried to get help from the manufacturer and they ignored me. Be warned...."
1,What's the Point?...If It Doesn't Work.,"Pros:- Looks nice- Plastic has a white stripe specifically designed so you can write dates and names.Cons:- It is so hard to use.- Vacuum does not work.Overall - Too bad, this thing just does not work! How did this product passed into production phase, I just don't know."
1,Worst vacuum sealer I've ever owned,I own several Deni products. This is the most dissapointing. It doesn't vacuum all the air out. I even returned it for a replacement & I expierenced the same problem. This is going into the trash & I'm getting another FoodSaver.
1,Deni 1331 Vac Sealer,"This sealer is junk. As a mechanical engineer of over thirty years experience, I'll say it again, this sealer is junk. Don't waste your money or time. they should be ashamed to sell this POS."
1,Do NOT buy this!,"This vacuum sealer does not seal bags and will not hold a vacuum because of this. The bags are too thin and it only has a heated wire to cut the bags which leaves a jagged edge that will not seal. The vacuum is very weak and does not stay. Spend any money for this sealer on something which will cost a bit more, but will work! I wasted time, money, and food on this!"
2,Not really worth the money,"I wish I had purchased a better product. Trying to save money, I probably got my monies worth, but expected more."
1,Bad sealing,"I wanted a sealing machine with good quality, these machine dont seal real good, every time have mini holes where the air comes in, an the worst is that the vacuum power is not so big, so it cant do an efective vacuum, bad product"
4,it Alright,At first it took about two people to work the machine. but when we caught the hang of it and know it absolutely great. our meat is fresh and clean i love it.
1,cheap plastic and not seal good,"You get for what you pay. At first the price for sure calls your attention, but you need to be aware that this is a cheap bagging solution. The bag is thin and cheap (to have an idea it's thin like a supermarket/grocecy plastic bag but less resistant).Second sometimes it seals, sometimes it doesn't. So it doesn't matter how much you work to vacuum the air from the bag because sometimes the seal is not perfect and since the plastic bag is cheap, any meat with bone such as t-bone can damage the bag and make a whole.I never worked with FoodSaver vaccum sealer but I saw their bags and if we compare the quality of the Deni bag with the FoodSaver on a scale from 0 to 10 I would give 1 to Deni and 10 to FoodSaver."
1,Don't waste your money,It doesn't seal anything properly. The vacuum head is tiny and there is no way to keep air out definitely. It seals precariously and you waste a lot of bags trying to figure out ways to 'make it work right'. Spend more money and get your money's worth from a better product.
1,Deezle,"WORKED VERY POORLY!!! It does not vacuum seal at all, merely a ""zip-lock"" bag machine. It covers your stuff in plastic and then melts the edges to make a seal. I only wish I hadn't thrown out the box it came in, otherwise I would have returned it asap! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Bad quality vacuum sealer,Dont waste your money this vacuum sealer doesn't suck all air in the bag maybe it is because poor pump qualityNot worth it
5,Beautiful book,"Evidently our dog thought it was not only gorgeous to look at, but downright tasty as well. He ate the last one we owned."
4,Good bubbles. smells unscented.,I am on a mission to find natural products for my family so I gave this product a try. It makes great bubbles but the one problem I had is there is essentially no smell. It smells unscented but it isn't. It is supposed to have a nice mixture of essential oils but you can't smell them!
4,Escapist Fare,"Anyone who enjoys relaxing both musically and visually should consider this dvd. Three of the twelve cuts are from Patrick O' Hearns ""So Flows The Current"" cd, the rest are from various other albums. The video footage is beautifully matched to the music, with moments of grandeur and intimacy woven seamlessly with some of Patricks best music. Recommended!"
3,Beware...COM Services and some pages about .NET,"Don't get me wrong!! It's a great book, for understanding COM+ and use it, without all the headache of learning ""why"".But i think many people would believe is a good about .NET and how to use COM Services, but you will get only a few pages about implementing both technologies together.But, like i've said, it's a good book about COM Services."
5,One of the most profound influences in my life,"From professional colleagues to the family members who drive me crazy to my spouse, this book has truly changed the way I relate to people. Through gaining an understanding of how people communicate--how we all have our own unique mind--I now understand how I can most effectively listen to others, speak my heart and connect with people on their terms. Most importantly, I understand my own particular quirks and needs (and realize they're not ""quirks"" but simply how my mind processes, etc.) and I cherish those qualities in myself--and work with them--instead of trying to change them to fit another way of thinking. This book has been instrumental in helping me take charge of the interactions I have in my life, and it has been one of the most profound influences of my adult relationship life."
3,"Useful, though somewhat dated content, poor quality cover","Though only a short way through the book, I've already found the content relevant and useful.I understand Markova wrote this for a popular audience, yet I find myself wishing she had included references to her sources (though she did include a bibliography of mostly secondary sources).With over a decade passed since the books's publication, I'd like to see an updated edition.The quality of the cover disappointed me; In just the few weeks of very gentle use in our admittedly humid environment (55%), the cover has almost completely curled back on itself, and the layer of plastic on the outside of the book has begun to peel off."
1,HAWKING wifi range extender,I bought a HWUR54G. After following instruction explicitly I had trouble and it took several hours to finally get it working. But only by hooking it to a router. When I do I get IP address conflicts. The setup wizard bombs if I hook the lan cable directly to a PC. Tech no-support either doesn't answer the phone or the phone is busy. Email I sent only got an auto-reply.
2,Underwriters Laboratory?,"Seriously, who thought that this was hassle-free? It took me two days and a morning to configure this thing. Not that it isn't fun to use, just that if I were to look at it's smooth lines and no gimmicks chassis, I would have thought you would have made this a better product?! You get what you pay for? It could have been much cheaper with as much tweaking I had to do."
1,impossible setup - not for normal users,"The instructions are not accurate. After hours over days the AT&T tech support folks came to my house (!) and even they could not get this to work with the new model 2700 HG-B 2Wire wireless modem. I did find the new tech support number 888-202-3344 for Hawking and they have real live and very nice people. But I did have to send this back. At least Amazon is helpful on the returns--but this was a major pain in the bottom and it is a VERY, very hard install that no one should have to go through. If you are a wireless wizard then maybe it will work on older gateways but it is not a true ""universal"" extender and normal users will find frustation if they buy this thing!"
3,"Hard to set up, but works great afterwards","I had a hard time getting this thing set up. It was so difficult, in fact, that I thought I was going to end up returning it. But, lo and behold, everything finally clicked! Once I got it set up, it is doing exactly what I wanted it to do. Some how it picks up the signal that my laptop could barely pick up and regenerates it at almost full strength. I live in an old house with plaster walls. I've had a wireless network for about two years. This is the best it's ever worked. It even made it possible for me to add my TiVo to my network.I only give it 3 stars overall. But, I would give it 1 star for setup and 5 stars for performance after set up."
1,Hawking HWUR54G Wireless G Universal Range Extender,"This Hawking Range Extender proved impossible to install. I called Hawking tech support many times but never got thru. Wrote emails to Hawking tech support, and they sent me corrected directions and a firmware update, but ignored my questions.Followed their difficult instructions, but no joy. Asked tech savvy friend help, and he worked for three hours, and advised me to return the Hawking HWUR54G. I am trying to do that. I plan to try a D-Link wireless range extender next.Please note: every range extender has several good reviews and several really bad reviews. Most of the favorable reviews are written by people who worked very hard to install the product and got extensive help from tech support before they succeeded. I suspect that all of these Range Extenders are difficult to install and require expertise far beyond the capabilities of a simple physics major and Bush Fellow such as myself."
1,Save yourself the headache!,"Could not for the life of me get this thing to work. Followed all the instructions to the letter, my PC could pick up the signal but was constantly ""Acquiring network address"" and never actually was able to connect to the extender. Customer support was totally and completely unhelpful. A total waste of money. I'd return but I can't find my proof of purchase, so I'm out a chunk of money."
1,Typical Hawking,"I have purchased two Hawking products, a directional(gain?) wireless antenna(lost signal strength) and the HWUR54G repeater/range extender. The HWUR54G is all show and no go. It has poor sensitivity, poor output signal, broadcasts only on the same channel as it receives, and is rather user unfriendly. They will not get me again! It sort of works but is mostly worthless. An outdated wireless bridge and router are much better."
5,Kathy Ross's Books Are Superb!,"I have 2 children, ...and we sit down with Ms. Ross's books andthey pick out a project. The instructions are very easy to follow andmost of the supplies needed can be found around the home. They don'ttake much time to complete which helps to keep the kids attention. Wemade several decorations for gifts for the kids grandparents and theywere thrilled and the kids are so proud of their projects. I alreadyown 7 of her books and plan to get them all eventually. I highlyrecommend this and all her books."
2,Not so good,I bought 2 of these since the first one broke after 12 months. I never really got it to work consistently and X-10 works great throughout my entire house.
4,a lightly latin brazilian blend,"""Espresso, espresso"" was the first Karminsky experience I laid ears on, but not the last! Smooth disc with lots of comfortable latinjazz tracks in a sixties groove. Unlike a lot of easy listening cds, espresso espresso has integrity and stays focused throughout the entire disc with quality tracks that relate to each other and gives it a great composition alltogether."
4,Strange Bedfellows,"Firstly, I am a 59-year old grandmother and rap and the drug culture are far out of my realm. However, while channel surfing one evening, I came upon this movie. (My daughters of fans of 50-cent's music and I was curious). This movie was intriguing and although offended by the violence and language, it was an opportunity to be non-judgmental and look at the story and the quality of the movie. I saw it to the end. It would be difficult to see this movie again, but I thought it was a good one. The actress who played his son's mother was outstanding, and the protaganist was very convincing."
1,"darn,he survived those bullets !!!!!!",but his acting career cant survive this bomb!!!!!! if he has 1 more movie in him itll be that of the heavy bag in rocky 6.
1,Ya know WHAT?!?!?!,"i think 50 cent S.U.C.K.S! even the gorillaz could have made a better movie, they already have won awards for Feel Good Inc. and 50 cent dissed them. Cartoon characters are a waest of time blah blah blah! Atleast their songs arn`t about drugs and picking up ho`s, and have hot sex in the back of their car. Plus, everyone at my school (yes, I`m a 5th Grader) are always say`in stuff like 50 cent rules! Yeah dude, I like asked this girl to have hot sex with me in my brothers car. Go back to the neighborhood! 50 cent! Oh yeah and the person who keeps being a dumba$$ and writing pointless reviews to make people stop writing whatever they want: YOU CAN KISS MAH A$$! M`KAY! So, while you waset your time I`ll be listening to the Gorillaz and watching South Park along with it."
2,it was ok,"50 cent has a screen pressence&I liked the story line. but the film makes me think of Eminem's ""8 miles"",but this film manily puts me in the frame of mind of One of 50 Cent's main influences 2Pac's ""Juice"" Film. this film had some pretty good acting&it is a sad story. there are things that i wished had have been furthered talked about such as 50's situation with sony&how he got where he ended up getting&also during his Adult life there is no time frame to indicate where he is exactly with his life.but this film is ok."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,I KNOW WHY 50 HATES JA RULE!!!THE PERSON PLAYING DANGEROUS WAS BASED ON JA RULE!HE WAS AND IS A HATER!!!HE TRIED TO STOP 50 FROM MAKING RECORDS AFTER JAIL!50 IS DOING WAY BETTER AND SELLING MORE CD'S THAN JA RULE EVER WILL!THE MOVIE WAS GREAT!JA RULE IS OVER!!!!!!!!!I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE HATERS!!5 STAR MOVIE *****
4,As a middle class white person I was very impressed.,"I caught this movie by accident on MTV3. I was transfixed immediately. It is violent so don't line your kids up to watch it. However it reaches into the soul of what certain areas of our country and its people experience on a daily basis. The acting by the rap artist was outstanding. Griping, heart wrenching movie that every one should see."
1,SUCK SO SO BAD!!!,"I HAVEN'T SEEN IT, AND I'M NOT GONNA CAUSE IT SUCKS! THEY SHOULD'VE DIRECT A MOVIE ABOUT DARRELL DIMEBAG! RIP DIME! WHO POSTED THAT THEY SHOULD GO BACK FLIPPING BURGERS IS RIGHT!"
1,Get rich or die toilet,"? ?th 2005 heralded the release of ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin'"", FIDDY FREAKIN CENT's latest offering to his mass of devout followers. Fiddy's hair is disguistingly nappy and he doesn't even bother ponytailing it; it just hangs limply in mullet fashion. There are a couple of bright spots here though: #1) the camera keeps panning in on Fiddy's teeth and #2) Fiddy rocks a totally sweet pair of teeth for about half the film. So if you must watch it, there are only two amusing things to look for: Fiddy's teeth and Fiddy swinging on a chandolier."
3,Make an english version,I only saw this movie in Spanish and I don't speak Spanish so this movie wasn't very good. I really wish immigrants would stop trying to take over American industry with their Mexican actors like Mr. Curtis Jackson!
4,"Learn what goes down in a big inner city, even if you dont like rap","Don't know why but fiddy reminds me of Mike Tyson but with big white teeth. Seems like I've seen this whole plot before in some other ghetto movie based out of L.A.I don't buy 50s music but I'd have to say this movie was pretty entertaining since it was different from the typical movies on the shelf. This isn't an actual account of 50's life as I originally thought but contains some experiences he had.If you ignant bout whats goes down in the inner city, rent this to give you some perspective...f' sho.B-"
1,Curtis Got Bitched and Died Crying,F**K THIS MOVIE. I DON'T CARE IF I DIDN'T SEE IT! I'M NOT GONNA WATCH A MOVIE ABOUT SOMEONE I HATE! BUT O KNOW IT SUCKS! THEY SHOULD'VE DIRECT A MOVIE ABOUT SOMEONE WHO DIED INSTEAD OF SOMEONE WHO IS STILL ALIVE! THEY SHOULD'VE DIRECT A MOVIE ABOUT DIMEBAG! Get Killed or Try Dying hahahaha.That Was a good one S. Sarhan. And EMINEM FAN! GO TO HELL! HIS NAME IS DIMEBAG YOU BIG BLACK RETARD! YA I SAID THAT AND YOU WON'T FIND ME! THIS DUDE DESERVSE A MOVIE ABOUT HIS STORY! NOT SOME SHMUG WHO IS STILL ALIVE!
2,Embarrasing first crack at the movie biz,"You'd think 50 or Sheridan was smart enough to base the movie on someone other than 50-well, it was supposed to be loosely based on his life, but that's dangerously territory to tread. It was way more funny than it was thuggin'. It wasn't completely a waste. It was good for a few laughs from time to time. If you think this is bad, check out Cam'ron's Killa Season. That movie flat-out sucks, but it sold more on the streets than 50's dud did in theaters!"
2,Something To Watch If You Don't Have Cable,This movie is just whatever. It was something to watch on a Sunday night. 50 Cent was pretty much like cardboard and he could've used the extra acting lessons. I've never been impressed with 50 Cent's rapping and I was actually embarrassed to hear him rapping in the movie.
2,What American Cinema Is Coming To?,"This film is basically about drugs and killing. I did not really find a plot behind it. I did have a story but it was not a very strong one. I kind of like 50 Cent so I thought that it was going to be an ok movie. I was wrong. I do not hold the same respect for 50 cent that I have because I cannot beleive that he starred in such a meaningless film.The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I did want to see what happened in the end, so I watched it and payed attention. Other than that, I hopefully will never see this film again."
1,They should have called this movie dying,"This movie will be heading on my of the worst movies of the year, it is dreadful, 5-0 is not only a pathetic rapper, he's a dreadful actor as well, Poor Terrance Howard looking extremely wasted in this one, this is just the same pathetic idiotic shtick that it's been done before.If you want to see a much better movie about the hood, see Boyz N The Hood with a Much better rapper and actor Name Ice Cube.This Movie is a mess."
2,"Well....50 cent is great, but movie isnt","Dont recommend this movie. I am 14...not enjoyin it my 19 yr old brother didnt like it either. 8 mile was definitly better... they also should have made it pg-13..and cut some of the ""crap"" out of it. The part i liked was the music. Personally, if you like 50 cent, i recommend stickin' to the music, not the acting. It ruins his rep. Besides, who wants great 50 cent to start rolling down the hill?"
1,50 Needs to stop Lyin,"When i heard people saying ""man i got alot of respect for 50 cent after seeing what he went thru"" but the truth is that he made up alot of what happend in the movie and in his career,for example he says he got got 9 times the truth is he only got shot twice,he just tries to build up his street credibility,by trying to show people that hes been thru alot,but bottom line if you watch this movie remember that only about 10% of the movie is fact,and also remember tha 50 cent is just an entertainer not some street thug turned rapper."
1,Meaningless,"This movies should have never made it to the big screen it should have went straight to video. This is the rip-off version of ""Hustle N Flow"" which by the way is a movie worth having. Whoever shot 50 why did you miss every major organ I mean aim for the head not the body. You know what, 50 never went to go look for the guys that shot him all he did was brag about it but that is not cool it shows his weakness. Anyways stay away from this it is dumb and pointless. GGGGGGGGGGGGGG......whatever man just make your money and stop bragging hopefully a young brother will have a better shot."
1,Bad Winder,"Upon receipt of this item, I found it to be beautifully polished beyond any expectation of it's picture when I bought it. When I put in the batteries, the battery cover cracked. It was the little plastic tabs that hold the cover in, and it made no sense in glueing it because would make the cap too rigid to open and close again.When I used the winder, it appeared to work the first few times. It has no problem spinning. But as far as keeping the watch going over 24 hours, that it cannot do. I have a rolex and it doesn't work on it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless to someone I don't like very much."
3,Important Concept; Format Distracting,"The concept of followership is important and often ignored in a sea of leadership materials.Chaleff has tackled an important issue, and for that he should be applauded. Most of the book is clear and easy to follow, with many lists that can be used to conduct training on being a strong follower. The ways in which followers support leaders and interact with each other are useful to anyone working with teams. Chaleff has also made changes in the second edition that make it easier for followers to take a stand instead of walking away.Where the book falls short is primarily in design, in my opinion. The switch from single- to double-spacing made me feel like the editors were trying to stretch the material to meet a pre-set number of pages.Overall, though, the book provides much to think about."
3,"Pretty good; repetitive, and thin on content","This book fell short of my expectations, based on some of the other reviews. The content is thin, and the author is rather repetitive, as if he is trying to spread the material out far enough to make a full length book, where a single chapter would have been sufficient. The double spacing which appears in sections of the book helps stretch it out, also, as another reviewer pointed out.Most of the material seemed like common sense to me, but I should reveal that I do have an extensive background in psychology. Maybe the ideas in this book are new to those in the corporate world, so do consider reading it if you do not have much of a psych background.It's a pretty good, rather quick and easy read, overall, but nothing earth shaking or terribly original."
3,Class Book,This is a book I got for class. So far so good. I'm sure it will stay in my collection as I read many books on leadership and following qualities.
2,Good Book but has no resale value,I bought this book for a pysc class. THe prof. said we would be able to resale it...ha ha nope
3,Colorful and entertaining.,"The illustrations are everything I have come to expect from Mark Buehner; however, the pictures are so entertaining that the story becomes secondary to them. It is an enjoyable book, and I will be reading it to my boys for many years to come."
4,Secret pictures,Look carefully at the illustrations. There are reoccurring images in the illustrations and secret images! It's fun to locate them all. I have read this dozens of times and am still finding new things.
5,An amazing person & story.,"I met Chaim Herzog in 1996, after the publication of his book and just before his death. I knew that he was one of Israel's formost warriors/statesmen, but of his life in between, well, I realized that I knew nothing indeed about him until I began to read his memoir.The title ""Living History"" is perfect in all its sense. It's a fascinating account of his and modern Israel's story."
1,Slendertone Flex,"I received it several weeks ago. It would not do anything. I called the phone # for help. You need to put the sticky belt on and then call. I never did as I was just getting ready to go away and not prepared to put it all back on, and stand there with a sticky belt on and wait to get through to customer help. I am thinking of returning it. Also, after approximately 20 uses you have to buy new sticky pads. Not looking forward to continually replacing them."
1,really did not work,"i have used this for a number of months, and it has not worked like it says it would. i have lost weight due to diet pills, but my stomach has not firmed up at all one bit."
1,Slender tone for women,I don't like it. It didn't do anything. I hope I can get my money back. It was expensisve. =(
1,Unintended Consequences,"After faithfully using the Slendertone Women's Flex Abdominal Toning System Belt for nine months, my wife gave birth to a robot.We've now spent thousands of dollars on lithium batteries and stainless steel cleaner in an effort to keep our little bundle of joy healthy and shiny. Sure, my wife's abdominals look like a xylophone, but was it really worth it? I think not."
5,"Nice product, very useful","I bought this two weeks ago. Using that almost every day. It works significantly for me. So I recommend that to my friends. Two of them bought, (one is for man, the other is for lady)and both of them extremly likt that."
1,Stupid product,"This product does not work at all, it is more like a belly massage than something to tone your abs. Ridiculous product."
3,Slendertone Women's Flex,The Slendertone Flex belt is awesome. It definitely does what is advertised. The only problem was it broke after six months and Slendertone wouldn't fix it. It was very disappointing. I will not buy again.
2,"THIS AB BELT MADE ME FEEL SICK, DON'T BUY IT!!","I don't normally leave reviews, but this product made me sick. I've had 2 c-sections and as a result, I've lost alot of core strength. I thought I'd give this a try. At first, it was a very weird sensation and then I thought ok, if it works, I'll stick with it. I used it every day for 6 days on a fairly high intensity and by the following day I felt lightheaded, sweaty and very nauseous. I had no appetite. I haven't used the belt for 3 days now and I'm starting to feel more normal, like myself again. Last night I still felt weird tingles and almost twitchy spasm type feelings. I honestly believe that this product made me sick and that it's dangerous. I'm not using it again."
3,Malfunction after first use,I bought this belt extremely excited to use it. After assembling the belt it wouldn't work. I tried to troubleshoot for about 2 hours with no luck. I called the company to see if they could help me with no resolution. I am very displeased with this product because of the malfunction.
5,Perfect Passover Planner,"Rabbi Alan and Jo Kay's wonderful new book ""Make Your Own Passover Seder"" is just the thing for families starting out who might need guidance on the holiday rituals, as well as for the seasoned pro looking to spice up his or her seder. Their helpful hints, thoughful readings and inspired suggestions truly make the holiday and the seder ritual accessible and the book speaks to a wide and varied audience.Don't walk, RUN to the bookstore (or the computer) and purchase this book!(Also makes a great gift for a seder host or hostess)."
3,Did Not Work Out,Nothing wrong with the product as it was the same as the one that it replaced with no apprecable difference in performance. It was not the fault of the product as what is at fault is how my plumbing is set up under the sink that doesn't end up with the proper suction to make the product work as it should. Will need to revise present plumbing.
2,Too short,"It is not too extensive ( as much as a book for 1-2 year olds can be). I was expecting more ""body parts""......"
1,Crap!!!,"I have never read a more self serving, self-published, piece of crap book in my life. The author comes across as an arrogant law enforcement officer, that makes his own rules. The trouble is that none of his stories are believable. Nothing rings true.Not worth the time."
3,OK dvd,Some of the cartoon were funny and some was weak. Overall the cd was pretty good to have. Still worth buying and putting in your dvd collection.
1,...it is FICTION!!!,"The title is misleading; this book is pure, bad fiction. It is deceptively advertised leading you to believe that you will get some juicy details about the phone sex business, but, instead, you read boring and tiresome fiction that stinks! When I read on the copyright page that it was a work of fiction, I was very angry... we shouldn't encourage deceptive advertising and we don't want to aid and abet terrible writing."
2,Not about phone sex,"I must agree with one of the reviewers that the title was misleading; this book has nothing to do with phone sex, except that the narrator owns a phone sex company. Instead it is a work of fiction, or, perhaps, a thinly veiled autobiogrpahy, of a woman living in a world of her own projections. I found the writing style to be uninteresting, with no significant plot or character development."
1,Do not recommend,"Went against my better judgement for buying this product after reading reviews. I used it between my computer and printer and I get ""communication errors almost every time. I bought three and will throw them away."
1,did not work for me,I wish I could give this product not even one star. It did not serve the purpose I purchased it for.
3,Not really much economics,"While Michael Todaro's text is widely used, as another reviewer points out, it is as much political ""science"" and sociology as economics. I am an economics professor and I have taught Economic Development courses from this text and had to repeatedly bring the perspective of neo-classical economics which was lacking or misconstrued. This text is closer to neo-Marxist than neo-classical.If you wish to gain the insights of economics, I would recommend ""The Elusive Quest for Growth : Economists' Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics"" by William Easterly."
5,Understanding the theory,"Having observed the process of economic development first hand while living in a recently developed country, I especially appreciated the theoretical explanations of development provided by this wonderful book. I would recommend it without hesitation to anyone with an interest in the subject."
1,"Cheaply made, no returns or exchanges after 30 days","I received these boots for my 8 year old son on October 24, 2012. They seemed really nice in the beginning but now the sole is coming off of the boot. Not happy and I can't return or exchange them now."
5,Great Boots,Excellent boots! Just know that they do have thinsulate insulation- not a bad thing especially in the winter! Super fast shipping from Amazon! Ordered on a Sunday and recieved on Tuesday! Very impressed!
2,not happy,although they look nice but not very durable for school age children. My son scraped the front of his show on the first day waring them. Now they look like very old.
3,"Falling apart, first day ...","My son tried these on yesterday.. they fit.. and they seem to be what we were looking for.. but.... the laces were coming apart minutes after they were laced up. Thankfully we use leather laces in most of our boots and replaced these with leather laces. It was still disappointing.The boot seems decent quality, for what we paid."
3,Cute but not durable,These sweet little boots are absolutely adorable but are not made to endure the activities of a 2 year old boy. The toe of the boot was completely destroyed after wearing them once outside to play.
4,An excellent browsing or reference book.,"There is a lot of information in this book, presented in an easy to read style. It explains the history of mandalas and the practical use of them. The text has headings on colours, symbols and numbers that appear commonly in mandalas when people create them. The text also has headings on the form or design of the mandala. Under the headings, the author draws on her own extensive research and insights to explain how each colour, symbol and number and form can be interpreted."
3,How to understand Mandalas,"this book gives an overview on how to understand mandalas. I was looking for a book on creating them and teach students how to create them. This book is all words no pictures so if you are a teacher and want to teach students how to develop them this is not the book. If you want to understand mandalas and how they are used, this is the right book."
5,Want to know about mandalas?,"A lot of great information! If you want to know about mandalas, get this book. No art. No actual mandalas. Still, the best info I've found."
5,An Excellent way to find out more about yourself,"This book is an amazing way to find out more about yourself and where you are at any particular moment. I teach in a school for massage therapy and this is one of the things I do with my students. We spend a few hours discussing Mandalas and what their significance is and then they create one. It always gives them such great information and it's a great way to chart progress as well. Some of them do mandalas on their own throughout their time in school and we can watch them morph and change. This book gives detailed information, instructions and assements of what your mandala means. I highly recommend it."
4,who wrote the amazon review?,"How does the person who wrote the amazon review not know that the ""quartet of older (and unidentified) ladies wail[ing] on what could easily pass for a lowdown, foot-stomping blues"" is Caravan? Did this person not recognize Shirley Ceasar? Please let people qualified in the various genres review them so that the customer might get accurate information with which to make an informed decision. How many more people may purchase this DVD knowing that Caravan makes an appearance?"
1,Very poor quality knife,"Let me start by saying that I have always loved Gerber. I have their Commando Mk I boot knife, and own/have owned every one of their Multi-Plier tools. I still carry a eighteen year old flat nose Multi-Plier daily. This knife, however, is an embarrassment. I have owned it for a few weeks now, and it looks like it is about five years old. The coating on the blade is wearing off fairly evenly on the entire blade, the bottom two frame screws came loose and stripped, and worst of all the liner lock fails with minimal pressure exerted to the back of the blade.I would NOT trust my life to this knife.I have replaced it with a Kershaw Shallot."
1,"used to be a good knife, but now don't waste your money","i bought one of these a few years ago and was very impressed at the quality of this inexpensive knife. it became my favorite EDC blade. then i lost it about a month ago. i decided to buy another one here from Amazon and holy s*** has the quality gone down hill. the blade feels strong and there isn't much play at all, but the liner lock is horrible. mine wouldn't even lock open, and with the slightest bit of inadvertent pressure the blade would close.take my word for it... BUY SOMETHING ELSE."
3,"good knife, cheap handle.","i took this knife with me to afghanistan. it held up pretty good to quite a bit of abuse, but the handle did end up cracking. this knife is good, comfortable to carry, and everything, but it is not as solid as a rock. if the handle was made of stainless steel or aluminum, it would be a perfect knife.one very good thing, is it clips to your pocket and except for the clip itself, the knife is all the way in your pocket. like i said, if the handle was stainless or some kind of metal, it would be a great knife."
2,"looks great, sharp, and fun... for a while","i Really liked this when i first got it, still do, this knife is sharp and has a good feel in the hand. just dont through it at anything like i did cause the blade bends easily and is real loose. pretty cheap crap but still makes a very fine knife."
5,Good general-carry knife,"I've had one of these for several years as my general carry, and it's been great, until I lost it last week.Holds an edge well, very light, all metal but the holes in the grip make it easy to hold, and it's a good solid grip, not slippery or unwieldy. Easy to sharpen, easy to clean, the black has never scratched off the blade or handle, and it rides very well in the back pocket with the clip facing out. Good solid lock, easy to open, and when it's open it feels like a single piece of metal - no play in the folding mechanism at all for the entire time I owned it.Admittedly, I'm a computer programmer and not a commando, but for cutting wire ties, opening those stupid plastic clam-shell things they package everything in these days, stripping or cutting wire, prying various bits of metal away from each other, opening boxes, eating a steak, prying off a bottle cap, or the occasional camping trip, it's a great tool to have at hand."
5,Great product,"My husband's father gave him this knife several years ago as a gift! It's still in perfect condition, however he wanted a backup in case his broke! Amazon was the only place we could find it and it was such a great price, he ordered 2!"
3,Liner lock did not lock blade,The design & size of the knife is nice. Strong for the weight. The problem was the liner lock never fully engaged.I tried to have it serviced by Gerber but they wanted me to pay for shipping. I understand this is standard practice but adding a premium to the cost of the knife for something as basic as a blade lock working safely was not good. The service rep was unsympathetic and unwilling to work with me and not terribly nice to deal with.I've returned this knife to Amazon.
5,Good quality knife,"This is a well-made knife, with a strong blade that holds a good edge.It's a little heavy for a pocket knife, but the clip allows it to be carried anywhere."
3,Disappointing,"The actors, scenery, costumes were as expected from a BBC production - well done. Hate to give a middle of the road score to such an effort but the plot portrayed the characters as either/or crazy, stupid, selfish and mean. For every five minutes of kindness evidenced there was 40 minutes of back-biting and scheming - bad behavior to the point of being painful to witness - well out of proportion to daily existence even in such difficult times. Kept thinking that the next episode would make it worthwhile but it was bitter until the very end. Shame, shame, shame."
1,"Predictable, hackneyed, cliche-ridden rubbish","The Brits usually do this kind of thing suprerbly, but not this time. Every single cliche you can imagine is trotted out here by the no-talent writers and in such a way as to signal their arrival without any suspense or surprise. Everything here has been done a hundred times before and so is utterly predictable. How different from the excellent 1998 movie of the same name! This series is an insult to the intelligence. Riddled with historical inaccuracies, it presents the gritty, bleak war time Britain as all warmth and light in which everyone wears lovely clothes and has prefect skin, despite rations which supplied meat only once a week (if you were lucky), fish three times a year, fruit almost never and milk and eggs usually only in dried powedered form. What a piece of crap this is!"
3,couldn't get into t his one,"Love these period pieces, and most set in Britain or anything done by the BBC, but I found this to be tiresome, trying and a bit boring....just didn't ""click""."
2,Don't waste your money,"I was very disappointed and wish I had saved my money. While the costuming and scenery is lovely the acting in this production is at about a high school level. Not up to par with usual BBC standards. If you want good WW2 drama, buy Foyle's War."
3,Fascinating Look Into the Past,"My ignorance of the historical facts of how the Women's Land Army worked in England during WW2 probably helped me enjoy the series more, since I didn't know of the inaccuracies I see here in other reviews. I thoroughly enjoyed it though, especially seeing Summer Strallen, who I saw on stage last year as Meg Giry in Love Never Dies in London.I cannot imagine the struggle, loss, and heartache the English experienced during WW2, nor the sacrifice that many made even at home. The series takes a deep look into the emotional struggles of the women as they live together on a farm serving together."
5,Award winning drama with Nathaniel Parker,"Land Girls is a drama delving into the lives of four women of the Women's Land Army in England and how their stories interconnect. While sharing hardships and working the land, they build a unity that they'll remember a lifetime. The scenery is gorgeously filmed and Nathaniel Parker stunningly plays the Lord of the Manor along with his wife played spot on by Sophie Ward. This 2 disc series brilliantly captures the spirit of the Women's Land Army while dramatizing the personal stories of the four women and their environs to tug on the viewer's heart and mind. No wonder this wonderful BBC dramatic series won awards."
2,This was not up to BBC standards - the writer is at fault,"At the end of the first episode, I turned to my wife and asked, ""I wonder how this was reviewed?"" The innaccuracies were obvious: the Land Army women as portrayed were in many instances out of uniform, their conduct was in some instances grossly contrary to the norm as known from published diaries, and the portrayal of US Army procedures was completely naive and mis-represented. I blame the writer only, since the production standards themselves were sterling! What a waste of fine BBC support effort ..."
4,Interesting but not absorbing,"I have to give this series four stars because I did enjoy it, even if it had its flaws. The acting is quite good, and you'll probably see many familiar faces if you, like me, enjoy these mini-series. However, i felt it was not really deep enough, and didn't really highlight the real work and struggles of these women during the war. While some romance is always welcome, I felt there wasn't enough substance to counterbalance it. Overall though, I can't complain. It was entertaining and filmed beautifully."
1,"Don't waste your money, especially if you are British","This was appallingly bad, and I am having trouble even giving it to my British friends. The story is so improbable and historically inaccurate. If you are British, you would not want to lay claim to owning it."
2,A different view,"Actually, I would say these are excessively dense, taste only vaguely like chocolate, and if they provide you with a burst of energy, I'd look into malnourishment remedies.Not awful, but I think they would have served David better in his spat with Goliath than they will serve you as a chocolatey treat."
5,Fun and easy to use!,"My (almost) 5 year old son received this as a gift for Christmas. He loves playing with cars and we knew he would be thrilled to be able to design his own cars. This set comes with all the pieces you need to make some very cool cars. You have the option of using your imagination to build your own design, or follow their instruction booklet to make some of their cool designs. We have already gotten hours of use out of this toy! Recommend!"
3,Too hard for little fingers,"Although this toy is really flexible and looks to have a lot of possibility, it is physically too difficult for four-year old fingers to jam the pieces together, although well withing a four-year old's technical capabilities. It does seem sturdy. The pieces should be better color coded so that you can tell at a glance which kinds of pieces are which. Customers would benefit from having a suggestion booklet that includes a few very simple cars to start with, so that a kid could get some experience before being frustrated by the temptation to make really complex carts."
5,ZOOBMobile,"Fun fun funOne can make lots of different shaped vehicles. Create a car, play with it and then take it apart to start a new one."
2,Way to complex,I bought this item for a 6 year old. Big Mistake. I could not figure out how to construct a single one of the suggested designs let alone my grandson.
5,Zoob racer review from Justin age 5 typed by Dad,"I think that the zoob racer set is really cool. I like it cause you can build stuff relly cool out of it. I have built a submarine, flying machine, racer car that can fly, and some things from the book. I was really fun, and I want to get more of this stuff. I really want to try the remote control one, maybe I'll get it for my birthday or christmas. I think other people should get it. I really like doing this toy with Mom and Dad"
5,we love ZOOBS,we got Zoobs years ago and we love them but we couldnt find them anywhere!!! the ones we had bought our kids were breaking from all the use i saw these and didnt think twice about getting them!! my kids make all kinds if things not just the things in the books!!!
2,Pieces break too easily,"I eagerly got this toy for my boys a couple years ago, since they LOVE making vehicles. Well, the problem with these (this is admittedly our first zoob set, so I do not know if this is a problem with zoob in general) is that the female piece (the one with the petals that the male piece snaps into) kept breaking off. It has happened to at least 6+ pieces (at this point, I've lost count). Not only is it disappointing, but it's dangerous that a petal just breaks off and then there is a sharp edge left. For what they charge for this toy, I would have expected it to be much more sturdy. The idea is a good one, too bad the quality is just not there."
3,"In the end, not worth it","The pieces are pretty easy to put together and you can make cool things. However, the instruction booklet is very difficult to follow. We don't have enough pieces for the big trailer. Also, when you make a car, it is very flimsy and can get out of shape very easily. I was hoping we could make cars and then play with them, but they don't hold up well."
5,Great toy,The kids loved this toy and in seconds were able to construct several automobiles of different shapes and sized. It is also very derable because as the evening went on people did step on some of the designs by accident and the just came apart rather the broke due to the pressure of an adults weight.
5,Beautiful historic account,"Ride Around the World is a beautiful and facinating history of horses used to work, and play, in the management of livestock. In other words, the history of horses and their role in ranching. The scenery and the narration and the music are blended very well to make this a great watch. Anyone who is even slightly interested in horses, and especially those who like western disciplines, will absolutely love this DVD. I plan to purchase several copies for gifts."
2,Not that great.,I bought this for my husband. It was OK. He was born and raised as a working cowboy. Wrong video for him.
5,"Hi-Capacity NiCad Cordless Phone Battery for Cidco, Southwestern Bell",The product was perfect for the phone.
5,raffan is excellent in his overview,I really like this book for design and the ideas and concepts.Well worth the investment for your turning library!
4,o album,"to those who may be interested in good music and in good bass players don't miss it.this album is the most influent in artist's carrear. an albun wich is defenetely a new observation to the juvenil concepts and their dreams in the time of 60'/70'in portugal. with very good musical taste particulary on the selection of the instruments to be played, also the lyrics written by carlos t are very representative and imaginative as well,some influences in the themes are extremely relationed with blues but that is the background of him,never the less there are a few touching the popular as good as jazz.at last, a funny swing/pop/rock fusion."
3,"Worth reading if you're a fan of Rothbard. Otherwise, better treatments of the subject elsewhere.","I'm a pretty big fan of Murray Rothbard, the famous libertarian economist. For this reason, I read _Education: Free and Compulsory_ to get a brief (< 100 pages) glimpse into Rothbard's view on education. Not surprisingly, he comes out in favor of the parent over the state on the question of education.Along with Rothbard's critique of compulsory education, he provides a brief history of compulsory education in North America and Europe.I recommend the book if you're a fan of Rothbard's but would, otherwise, point the reader toward a more thorough treatment of the subject of education."
3,deeply troubling,"Mr. Tomasky seems to think that his white male patriarchal paradigms are somehow enobling, so much so that he can attempt to dismiss wholesale the unbelievably courageous work of feminists and multiculturalist minorities. He simply reads the whole situation wrong. I suppose he means well, but he lacks conviction in radical causes which challenge the eurocentric and insulated bigotry of contemporary academia and cultural discourse. Some of us will continue the fight, even if Mr. Tomasky lacks the courage and insight to do so."
3,Wait for paperback,"I love this author, but I felt this was one of his weaker efforts. The feeling isn't so much one of fantastical events but one of contrivance. I felt no emotional connection but irritation with all but one of the characters (the girlfriend). The internal logic is solid enough but the motivation is often mystifying and the amount of coincidence is excessive. I don't want to give away plot points like the professional review above, so I can't be specific. If you've never read a Ford book this is a treat, but comparing the author against himself this work leaves you wanting. (It would be refreshing if he moved on from quirky pseudo-science as a plot hinge.) Lastly, I'm beginning to think he has a monkey fixation!"
5,Excellent,"With great style and atmosphere, Ford takes you back to turn-of-century New York for a tale of a painter who must make a portrait of an unseen patron. This is no mere historical, but a story where reality begins to dissolve around the protagonist. For all its strangeness, this a novel of character about the trials of an artist. Deep, moving, entertaining this book is absolutely hypnotic."
3,2/3 of a good book,"This is almost an amazing book.The concept is intriguing, and through most of it just the enigma of Mrs. Charbuque kept me reading. I felt that the ""subplot"" (the mysterious disease that causes ppl to bleed from the eyes) was too sporadic and hamhandedly dealt with, and i felt the entire ending to be a bit of a tidied-up cop-out. I wish that the author had taken another 50-100 pages to flesh out the mystery-disease subplot and to wind up the story in a way that didn't feel so slam-bang. For something that purported to challenge gender and identity, it felt a bit rote."
5,Wonders and Nightmares,"Rich, complex, and often hilarious, The Portrait of Mrs. Charbuque is Ford's finest novel to date.The story is imbued with a dreamlike logic that remains utterly convincing even as it veers into some very strange territory (including a fortune teller who reads the future in excrement, a thief who picks locks with his fingernails, and a parasite that causes its victims to weep blood). Great characters, a marvelous premise, and Ford's unique imagination make this the best novel I've read so far this year."
3,Not a practical reference,"It's a cutesy little book, with some good suggestions for things, but not a reference manual as such. Each page contains a one sentence suggestion. Fun for lap reading, but not what you should purchase if you're looking for some solid detailed ideas on what to do in given situations."
4,Weird Al's weird kid's tv show,"My son remembers this show from when he was younger, he still loves it. He particularly enjoys the commentary by Weird Al and others on the story behind certain things that were done in each episode. Weird Al's show was a fun and entertaining alternative to the normal children's offerings of superheroes etc."
2,not so great,"My Kids LOVE wierd al, but this was just a little too wierd for them. Maybe it's their ages. They are 13 and 16. It reminds me too much of Pee Wee herman's show, only not as funny.And it's not for young kids. Weasle Stomping day is a bit much."
1,Terrible disappointment!,My children and I have always find Weird Al funny and we listen to his songs. We thought this DVD would give the hightlight to our collection. But the production is so poor that we felt we had just wasted our time and money on this. We did not even watch more than 30 minutes of the show.
5,Cool,"Just as advertised. Fits my shoes, towel, glove and powder(plus ball). I would recommend getting a shoulder strap as an extra."
4,"Good bag, good price","I was looking for an inexpensive bag for my bowling ball to keep from having it rolling around all over the place. This bag is constructed well, it holds a ball and a pair of shoes up to a men's size 8...you might be able to squeeze in a bigger pair though. It has a foam core ball holder at the bottom of the bag and a shoulder strap for carry over your shoulder."
4,Great bag for kids,"My son joined a league and now has his own bowling ball. We didn't need something to carry shoes and stuff, just the ball, so this worked out fine. He can carry it over his shoulder or by the small handle. It doesn't feel like it's gonna fall apart.This design was masculine enough for him."
5,very fast shipping!,Item arrived very quickly! I received it before it even said it had shipped! It is in great shape and is made of great quality. I will order from this company again.
4,The book is well worth reading any time or any age.,"Beardance is a book you just don't put it down until you finish it. On a scale from 1-5, I would rate this book a four and a half because, it teaches children and adults about things that if you put your mind to something and you have enough determination, you can get anything done. Cloyd goes back to the mountains with the old man to find more grizzly bears in Colorado. He finds two little cuds and the Fish and Wildlife Department take them away. It wasn't easy for Cloyd to try to save them. I admire him for trying to save his little friends. I was reading this book for language arts class and I encourage any student or adult to read Will Hobb's works because they are very interesting and exciting. I recomended this book to anyone who likes grizzly bears or the mountains."
3,Weaker than the first one,"Julian is out and lures Jenny into another Game - ""Lambs and Monsters,"" in which her friends are caught one by one by the Snake and the Wolf. Jenny has to find the Shadow Man's base in order to free her friends and to be released from the promise she has given Julian in the previous game.I found this book less entertaining than ""The Hunter."" It took almost half of the book for Julian to appear, the game itself was much weaker, we didn't learn anything new about the Shadow World, and there was too little interaction between Jenny and Julian. Hopefully the third book (""The Kill"") will be better."
3,An interesting book.,"It was an interesting book, but it didn't hold my intereststoo well. I much preferred The Vampire Diaries or The SecretCircle to Forbidden Games. Read it for yourself and see whatyou think."
5,HEY! L.J. SMITH FANS!! READ THIS!!!!!!!! I LOVE JULIAN!,"Hi, Um thanks for reading this! Did anyone else absolutly hate TOM!! Because I was just absolutly in love with Julian and Tom was nice but please!! I mean remeber when Jenny had the gold dress on and Jenny said that Tom wouldn't have let her where that?! PLease she should wear whatever she wants!!!! Julian would have let her!! He would have done anything for her and Tom couldn't even look at her when she had Julian's ring on even tho' she didn't want it on!!! ANYWAY IF YOU LIKED THIS GET THE VAMPIRE DIARIES TRILOGY'S! It's just as good and if you want to talk about this book, L.J Smith or IF YOU LOOK LIKE JULIAN PLEASE E-MAIL ME!!!!! thanks- Lestata Circle Midnight ""ALL I REFUSE AND JULIAN I CHUSE!"""
4,Very much a middle book,Jenny and her friends are dealing with the aftermath of the events of the first book. No one believes them about their friend's death and the paper house is still missing. When they finally find the paper house it is ripped to shreds and they don't know if Julian was released or not. All is soon reveled and they begin a new deadly game where Jenny's friends are disappearing one by one.This book wasn't nearly as good as the first one. The first half of the book is pretty dull. The action does pick up but it's barley enough to make up for the first half. I did like how we got to know the characters better but I didn't like how little Julian there was. The book kind of struck me as a filler book but I'm sure the last in the series will be much better.
5,The BEST of all three,"I really like The Forbidden Games Trilogy. It's the best one by L.J Smith. You feel as if you're really there with Jenny and her friends. I love all the characters especially Dee. It's sweet how Julian loves Jenny so much (he has been watching her since she was 5 years old)! I like Julian, he's gorgeous and sweet! But he does have his dark side. I disagree with most people on how Jenny should have surrendered to Julian. Everyone says that Tom didn't deserve Jenny or love her enough which is not true! Tom really did love her as much as Julian, and I think she made the right choice to stick with Tom. If you haven't read the Forbidden Game trilogy then I think you're really missing out! Get the books NOW!"
3,Not as good as the others,"I enjoyed this book, but I didn't like the way you had to wait until half way into it before the game started and Julian came along. He's my favourite character, and I really feel Jenny should have just gone with him! That being said, it's a good book and you HAVE to read it! I've set up a Yahoo! group called THeforbiddenGame to talk about it, so if you like these books as muchh as I do, please join!"
4,Great for choosing fish,"I found this book very helpful for choosing which fish to stock my tank with. Helpful lists of water requirements, and a rating on ease of keeping which I found helped me rule out fish that might have been too difficult for a beginner (not always clear with most other reference books I have read). The large pictures of each fish without the background clutter was also very useful as you knew exactly what you were getting and knew what to look for in a good, healthy fish."
1,poor pictures,"Otherwise the book would be nice, but fishes in the pictures look shocked. They have no color, they have nipped fins and I also saw whitespot. Reader will get bad picture about some species. Can't recommend."
2,"Go to Apple's DVD selection for your Beatle Fan- Boo, BBC!","Really, really disappointed with this movie. I'm pretty well- read on Lennon and a life- long fan but couldn't get into to this. History- wise, too, it focuses on some really irrelevant events and skips over other more important ones. For example, why the focus on John's dad? More Cyn! More Yoko! What about the music? I did agree with the more harsh betrayal of Lennon, as believe it or not, he is human. However, Yoko's quiet, less aggressive character was a disappointment. Their relationship seemed sudden here when John had been communicating with her since India... Some little details such as this add to the drama but take away accuracy.Anyway, any big Beatle nerd may appreciate this as simply ""amusing."" It was fun to yell at the screen, personally.A more normal fan will be bored and disgusted by Lennon.Don't buy. A waste!"
1,Character assassination from start to finish!,"Obviously the writer of this pile of crap had it in for John(was probably insanely jealous and/or another mark david chapman). From start to finish, painted John in the worst light possible, with lots of completely inaccurateevents even. There are lots of good books & movies about John and all of the Beatles, but this is NOT one of them.Would NOT recommend to anyone!! HORRIBLE!"
3,DVD for a friend,"I should have my friend review this since I bought it for her...she is the Lennon fan. She said the lead looked and talked like Lennon did. I watched it and the story line was enjoyable. I can't say I was riveted, but it made for a good time with a friend."
4,The madness of John Lennon,"My first thought was that I was disappointed that the actors in this film did not look anything like the real characters. As the film progressed, I found myself getting more involved and full of emotion. Lennon was a complex character and I believe he was truly mad. I'm not sure if his madness was drug induced or just part of his natural being. Lennon was a cruel, mean and angry man and his only cure was Yoko Ono. Eccleston did a fantastic job being Lennon. This film was like a fly on the wall view of this complex life. I'd definitely recommend this to all true Lennon fans."
1,overpriced collection of readily available music,"unless there is unknown magic going on, this is an import of music that is easy to get by album or song download. it is a small collection, yet the list price is over $60. avoid this at all cost as it is an importer's ripoff. i find it hard to believe that clayton-hamilton hasn't stepped up to warn people"
1,Don't be fooled by the nice cover,"That just happens to be the best picture you will find in this book, It rambles on and on about nothing and the pictures quickly get very very boring after seeing the fifth hand close-up, don't be fooled by the image and title, you learn very little ""storytelling"" here. Save your money and buy something else. This author may shoot weddings but she's a total amateur and snapshot artist. I hate this book"
1,"You've got to be kidding, this book ...","There's no doubt this book will give a different perspective but there are other books that will do the same thing, look for Bambi Cantrell or Philippe Cheng for a real wedding book. These are terrific."
2,A waste of time,"Again what other readers have said, you will learn nothing from this book, I felt like I was reading a diary, I was looking for more technical information, the pictures themselves quickly got boring after a while, how many half cut torso and zoomed in hands do I want to see anyway? There's some reportage quality to the pictures bit there are better books out there I'm sure, don't be fooled by the nice front cover, there's a reason why this book only has 4 sample pages"
3,Photos that will trigger your creativity!,"The quality of printed photos are not brilliant in this book, but the book is a great one to remind you why you fell in love with black and white photographs. The details of weddings are highlighted here, and it is a good book to keep as a reference tool."
5,"Hunger, not disease","In this courageous and lyrically excellent book, the poet brings us with great compassion into the loneliness of yearning and desire for human love while maintaining the objective and unflinching eye of a professional nurse. Her kindness, toward her own and others' bodies, is combined with a haunting truthfulness about human suffering. Her craft is impeccable and her images visually accurate and intelligent. I felt privileged to be introduced into her world and to recognize human suffering again as hunger, not disease."
5,Worth the Wait,"Ever since I read Cortney Davis' early poetry collection ""Details of Flesh"" and, later, her book ""I Knew A Woman,"" I've been watching and waiting for more. ""Leopold's Maneuver's"" is worth the wait -- it's beautiful and graceful and dignified and, as with all of Ms. Davis' work that I've read, opens my eyes and mind and heart to images and ideas that I had not seen before. I love this book."
3,It's ok,"I thought it was a bit cheesy how quickly she went from hate/dislike to true love. I also thought the same about him, it was just so contrived. Overall the book is good but not amazingly great. I think I liked the struggle she was going through more than the actual ""love story"" between her and Marcus. It just came out of nowhere for me. I gave it a 3 because I couldn't give a 3.5 and I didn't think it deserved a 4."
3,Derivative,"Much of this information when written may have been new at the time, but today it is available from many sources. If you have other reference works, you will not need this book. BTW, the newest release has identical content, but inferior binding to this product. A good intro for newbies, and a lot of it is not readily found on the internet."
2,Goodtimes Rooks the American Public Again,"Sigh...Goodtimes once again distributes an incomplete animated TV series to the US. The ""first"" DVD, ""Escape to Watership Down"" actually does not have the all important first episode when the rabbits leave Sandleford Warren. So there is no Fiver's first vision, no Cowslip nor the snare scene at the Warren of Shining Wires. These episodes DO exist and were broadcast in the UK & Canada. But Goodtimes seems to think it can get away with giving the American public only a partial product. It is a real travesty when such high-quality children's animation is shortchanged like this. Whoever is in charge of Goodtimes Family Films Distribution should be taken 'round the barn and put out of our misery."
2,raisin bread if you must,"This bread has a rather tough and crumbly texture but the raisins do add much needed moisture and taste. It is better toasted but was not as tasty as I was hoping. It does, however, make an acceptable french toast. This raisin bread illustrates the biggest problem with gluten free breads, namely, the lack of resemblence to the real deal."
1,Product is not as described,"I recently ordered a case of this Ener-g raisin loaf to try because I'm on a low salt diet and need to use potassium supplements instead. When you read the nutritional facts you see the product claims 55 mg sodium per slice and 200 mg of potassium. What you get is instead a product that has 80 mg sodium and 100 mg potassium. I can buy raisin bread at the store with lower sodium than this! To make matters worse, while I couldn't eat this bread, I gave some to a friend to try and even though it is supposed to have a long shelf life, the bread crumbled in his hands and was very powdery and tasted terrible. Either the shelf life had expired on this product when it was shipped or the preservatives are not working as well as expected. Maybe a fresh loaf purchased at a health food store might do better in a taste test but buyer beware in buying in bulk without seeing the product and not being able to return it to Amazon for a refund."
5,Gotta Get It!,"The Lucia Moniz album is awesome! I lived in Portugal for awhile and found this CD just before I came home to the states. It has something for everyone...English and Portuguese! If you like that Madonna sound with an Alanis Morrisette flare, you gotta get Lucia Moniz!"
5,An incredible CD!! Lucia Moniz is amazing!,"I was extremely impressed with the quality of this CD. I'm yet to find a song on it that I don't enjoy, and her second CD ""67"" is just as good! If you enjoyed the samples, trust me, you will thoroughly enjoy the entire CD. It's definitely a worthwhile purchase!"
5,U gotta give credit to this talented Portuguese girl!,"Magnólia is Lúcia Moniz's debut album, released in 99 and it had massive sucess here in Portugal.Portugal soon surrender itself to this girl's talent, voice and personality.Soundwise, Magnólia is quite mixed, with a mature pop-rock sound base.Remarkable tracks such as 'Dizer Que No', 'A Vida Segue Lá Fora', 'Perdida por Ti' and 'Try Again' (a duet with Nuno Bettencourt, also produce ron the album) make this album worth buying.Give it a listen, you will be pleasantly surprised!Just a reminder that Lúcia released last year her second album '67' which is even better than the first one and a bit more havier soundwise."
3,A disjointed effort,"I liked the earlier Hotel Paradise, apart from the deliberately obscure ending. This novel, featuring the same locale and at least one character, was disappointing in a different way. It reads like a first draft, and although the ending is understandable, there are a lot of unanswered questions left pending, particularly about the motivations of the various characters."
3,could have been a lot better.,"I like Martha Grimes (especially loved Hotel Paradise) and the detective here, DeGheyn, is a really great character. Likewise Maude, the well-drawn waitress who loves him. Both of these characters are great. The story plugs along fairly well until the end -- what a disappointment! It was as if she scribbled the last few pages in the car on the way to dropping off the manuscript. I really couldn't believe how poor an ending it was. Grimes has done and can do better."
3,Left a little unresolved.,"For fans of Grimes' Emma Graham series, this book is novel in that it gives a little bit of an adult perspective on the town and townspeople 12-year-old Emma describes. It's not a particularly strong mystery, but more of a blending with a dramatic, character-based story. It is dramatic and well written, but only one of the several plot threads is resolved. I imagine Grimes meant to revisit these characters, but moved on to Emma as a way to do that."
1,Extremely disappointing,"My first Martha Grimes mystery, and I expected much more from what others told me about this author. The plot was confusing, there were too many people with names like Bubba drinking too many Buds. Unless this is very different from her usual style, I wouldn't read her again."
1,frustrating,"I enjoy sewing, but don't like to lug around my mom's machine for simple things like hems. Luckily, I only spent $4 on this useless thing. I attempted to hem a pair of jeans, and it's fine for about 4 stitches, but then it stops feeding the fabric and the thread gets all jammed up into a huge knot. The box says it works on denim, but it didn't for me. Maybe it was just the material, because when I tested it on a scrap piece of regular fabric, it was fine. Also, it's difficult to make it stitch in a straight line."
1,Handy stitch sewing machine,"This item is junk. Their warranty says it all: the machine has to be returned under the warranty within 60 days, and the customer has to pay shipping both ways! IOW, $5.99 must be included with the machine for warranty service!This tells me that they know their product is junk, and they don't want to see any of them coming back on warranty.When it comes down to it, any company who makes a faulty product should be required to retrieve it at their expense, and then send it back fixed!The machine skips stitches all the time, is hard to use, and the seam either unravels as fast as you sew, or it unravels when you're trying to get the machine off the fabric.Bad design, junky product, good marketing."
1,HORRIBLE,"All I have to say is this product is horrible. Thread breaks, hard to use, can on;y go through VERY thin material. Do not buy."
1,NOT AT ALL WORTH IT,"I bought this as my first sewing machine, hoping to learn how to use one, but this does not work AT ALL! It unravels as you try to sew, or just wont sew at all. The needle is small and impossible to thread, and the machine broke within my first five stitches- it just sewed loops, not real stitches, that unraveled with a touch. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND INVEST IN SOMETHING BETTER!"
1,Ugh! It is so pointless.,"It puts thread in your fabric, but it has far from sewn anything. The moment any stress is put on it the thread falls out."
1,Flimsy Product,"Don't waste your money or space in the landfill! It's flimsy and doesn't work. I tried to use it to sew and it got stuck right away, ruined the fabric. I wish I could give it no stars, but it won't let me."
1,Review,My needle broke the first and only time I tried to use the Perfect Stich Pro. Which I just realilized is not the same name as the picture or what Amazon is sealing. The directions do not show how to catch the sew under the bottom fastening plate. I'm not exactly happy but I will give it an other try.
1,so frustrating,"Honestly go the extra mile and get the sewing machines that are bigger. This thing wouldnt fit the simplest fabric, was hard to even get a thin piece started ( baby clothing) After getting the fabric squeezed in it the thread would come out of the needle, would sew an inch then the string would come out, get hung up, or the fabric would get hung. The instructions is as pitaful as it can get. Dont even explain much. Waist of my money really. If it wouldnt realy fit a thin baby shirt then how the heck it suppose to do denim."
1,Total Junk!,"I would have given 0 stars if I could! I ordered the Handy Stitch but was sent a knock off called the Smart Stitch. It is the same concept and worked the same. I tested it on an old t-shirt and the stitches did not same in the material, they pulled out... Terrible product!"
1,Deserves zero stars,"I reviewed this years ago, but for some reason, my review was switched to sewing machine needles, so I deleted it. The content of my original review: ""If I could give this zero stars, I would. Returned this--it NEVER worked. You are better off buying a basic sewing machine.""This is a piece of garbage. I would not spend any money on this. Seriously--if you are looking for something to hem your clothes--invest in a REAL sewing machine--even if it's the basic cheap $50 model (but NOT a toy machine--I tried that, too, and returned it)."
2,bought as a gift.. very disappointed...,bought this for my mom who had been saying she wanted it everytime she saw the ad on tv unfortunately after recieving the product there were practically no instructions and after some time of trying to figure out how the thing went together we just gave up I would not recommend
3,Handheld Sewing Machine,It didnt work as well as I had hoped. Once it because time to thread again diaster happend so it sits in a box till I have more patience.
1,It doesn't stitch right *** I give it no stars!,"Unfortunatly I bought 2 of these, and it only sews the on the top. The stitching underneath isn't complete. Wish there was a warranty..."
1,Junk,Save your money and buy something else.I tried so many kinds of batteries to get it going and it still didn't work. Amazon should be ashamed to be selling this.
1,LucyJew,A piece of junk. I installed the battery and is no power. I'm thinking may be Home Ease the manufacturer put the battery directions wrong so I try 20 different ways to put the battery. I brought it to Radio Shack to purchase the a/c adaptor and still not work. No power supply go in. The machine can not turn on. I contact the seller. He said that only return my money for the cost of the product no shipping cost. Then I have to pay the shipping to return the product. So instead of I already lost $11.00 Now I would loose $16.00. So that I did not return it and I threw in the dumpster. This machine is made by Home Ease. It's painful. I have try so many hours and methods to make it work. Still no power. It gave me a lot of stresses and headaches. A piece of junk. This product is not deserve one star since we don't have one star on the review :(
1,Dont Bother,"I got the handheld sewing machine when i was seven. At the time i thought it was the best thing ever. Although after sewing two sides of a pillow i started to make, the machine broke, and started sewing very losely. Soon there after it just sewed loops. After two months of trying to fix it i threw it out. i am now into sewing, and i would recommend saving the money you will spend on a useless handheld sewing machine, and save up for a real one."
1,Worst Product EVER!,"I bought this little machine to do some hems, but never managed to get it to hold. This is the BIGGEST waste of money. Keep your $12 and invest it in something a little better. I recently purchased the Singer Pixie Craft machine which also allows for doing hems due to it's work arm. It's great! $40.00 at Walmart and the best part it actually gets the job done."
1,Do not waste your money,"I bought this because I just needed to hem several pairs of pants for my daughter who has short legs. It is horrible! Its impossible to get the material set, you can't use pins to hold what you want to sew, it will only sew extremely thin material which it then tends to bunch up, impossible to keep a straight line...I could go on and on. I wish I had read these reviews first before I bought it in a store."
1,Don't Do IT !,"I was so excited to receive my ""little sewing machine"" until I started using it or should I say trying to use it. It was terrible. Very hard to thread and worst of all IT DIDN'T work. It ran for a few stiches and then would ball up on the underside of the fabric with a HUGE knot of thread. Save your money to protct your sanity. Aaaarrrgggg!!!"
1,Not worth the money,I would not recommend purchasing the Handy Stitch. It is not that easy to use. The thread falls out of the needle very easily. It tells you to tighten the thread however that does not help. Not a good purchase!!!
2,More Trouble then its Worth,"More trouble then its worth!When I was finally able to get it to work for me(I was making a halloween costume), it looked like it did a great job, until the entire length that was sewn fell apart immediately! You have to Hand sew it to get it to stay in place.. It saved some time, but I was so fearful of the stitches falling out that I pinned the costume anyway! Dont waste your money. Although more pricey, Im spending my money on a REAL machine!"
2,works for a little while,"AT first it started working fine, but after a few months of use, the thread pulls right out of the fabric after its sewn. It will go through and it looks like its sewing but when you take it out, the thread unravels and you realize it fell out of the needle, its worhtless now. But it worked at first."
2,confusing instructions,"I actually do not know how well this gadget works since I have not been able to use it. I am not saying it is a bad product, but if you don't know anything about sewing this is not for you. The instructions that come with it have non-specific diagrams which makes it almost impossible to even get familiar with which part is what. it should come with better instructions."
1,Handy Stitch,This item is real easy to use but I wouldn't use it for anything that can be seen or looked at closely. It misses most of the stiches and breaks off the thread so it has to be rethreaded repeatedly. Better off putting out the extra money and getting something that really works.
2,Too small,"Apparently, I didn't see the size of these. They aren't x-large like I needed. I have the Booda Clean Step litter box, which has a strange shape. These don't fit. They're too small. I returned the bags I hadn't opened without problem, but I now have a bag opened of 8 that are too small and couldn't return."
5,Inspired Madness & Brilliant Chaos,I *loved* these books as a child-- so much that I found I could still remember some of the sentences word-for-word as an adult. Even as an adult I found myself giggling out loud as I read about The Bagthorpe's and their contest-entering mania.Shame that it's out of print! Bring it back!
5,"Hey, YAY, YOU","I gave this book to my 31 year old nephew who, after getting his BA in English, decided to be a high school English teacher. So, it was back to more college courses and a very difficult test to pass before being certified in Texas. I realize that YAY, YOU is really written on a child's level, but the message remains the same: It's a big, wide world out there, so soar as high and as far as you can when you can and have fun doing it. I am a retired teacher of 30 years who would use this book with my 4 year old granddaughter as well as my 31 year old nephew and any age in between and older."
3,"Yay, You","A books for graduates of all ages and any kind of graduation. It is cute and written by author Boynton who writes mostly for children. I am not sure the reason she wrote this but compared to the Dr. Seuss book ""Oh The Places You Will Go"", ""Yay, You"" Loses steam at the end of the book. The art is cute and resembles most of Boynton's books for children. I wish I could say more about it. Unfortunately I keep comparing it to Seuss. This was a nice try but I do not feel the enthusiasm."
5,A Trip to the Past for Mom and Kids,"When my children were small we read the Boynton board books so many times that we had to replace them for kid #3. They are one of my favorite baby shower gifts. Yay, You is a terrific book for both parents and kids (young adults?) as they enter the next life journey. Even if you have never experienced a Sandra Boynton book, you will enjoy this and smile as you realize that life goes on for all. This makes a fun grduation gift too!!"
5,I AM 24 AND I LOVE IT!!! (So do my co-workers=),"Just great fun to watch! Ants arrived within a week (ordered from antalive), 28 all very alive. (This was in October. I've seen some reviewers not do so well around the winter holydays because of the temperatures.)A great gift for any kid or adult =) (Awesome office toy!)"
3,bit by ants,"I was taking the dead ants out like the directions said - but they ALL started coming up and out - 3 ants got on my finger (WEAR GLOVES) and bit me. My hand swelled up and I was on medication for 1 week - prednisone, advil, claritin and benadryl - horrific reaction - they are VERY VERY venomous ants..."
5,The Witch's Christmas Book,"Thanks so much for this great little book. I had one when I was young and handed it down to my son when he was little. We spent many happy times reading this book when he was growing up and it has fond memories for both of us. Unfortunately, over the years, our original copy has been 'misplaced' somewhere and we have both been a little disappointed in thinking it was gone for good. But when I came across this copy I was so thrilled with being able to replace our old one, and this copy is actually in better shape then our old one, so it truely has been a great deal for us both to be able to own this little piece of warm memories that means so much to us. Thanks again, even for the super fast shipping and great condition of this book."
2,European Radio removal special tool,These keys are low quality and do not work very well - better to buy Audi original tool - or make your own.
4,Works but a bit too sharp,This tool worked with my '01 passat to get out the stock stereo where a clip was bentonly downside is the tool is way too sharp I cut my thumb in a few places trying to get thekey to clip in with the bent one inside the radio but it works I would advise wearing gloves just in case
3,They did there job,"The tools served their purpose to get the radio out of the dashboard. They're flimsy and edges are kind of sharp. If you are considering these for repetitive use, think again."
3,Works as promised but beware the sharp edges,"This set of removal Tools works as advertised in my Audi, however beware of the sharp edges, I slightly cut my fingers while pulling out the Radio. Otherwise decent material that didn't break or bent."
2,"Poor packaging, cheap materials",These were poorly packed both by the manufacturer and by Amazon. They are extremely thin aluminum and arrived bent to the point that one of them was about to lose one of the blades. I have no doubt I could have removed my radio once but probably never again. I sent them back.
5,Used them to remove radio from Audi TT,"The hazard light button in my '05 Audi TT got pushed in too far. Used these tools to remove the radio and push the button back out to the correct level. Worked great, took less than 5 minutes."
4,Worked Perfect,"They worked exactly as they were supposed to. A bit on the flimsy side, i felt like it wouldnt take much to break or bend them. But still, they got the job done."
2,fast shipping,ok so it came in pretty quick. went to remove my radio and they feel really flimsy and it cut my hand with it so i would recommend using gloves with this
4,Should be on DVD,"This is an interesting film. The UPA Studio designs are stylish and chic. The music and songs are your typical 1960's romantic fare. Mr. Magoo is funny and exasperating as usual. The Arabian Nights story of Aladdin is there, although it seems to take a back seat to the fancy artwork. It's not the most exciting blockbuster film I've ever seen, but it's a pleasant viewing experience.A typical Amazon review is, ""Great film! Why oh why isn't this on DVD yet?"", and that certainly applies to this film. The only version I could find of this film was on VHS (recorded at a slow, inferior speed to save tape), which of course, doesn't do justice at all to the gorgeous graphics. This handsome film would really sparkle on DVD. Not only that, it's a part of American animation history, and for that reason alone deserves a DVD.Until that time, we'll have to content ourselves with 20-plus year old VHS tapes, which is like drinking a fine wine out of a dirty tin can."
4,Works pretty nice,I bought one of these from my local Sam's club 2 years ago. It works fine for airing up fairly large tires (265/75/15 in about 3 minutes!). Recommended product if you ask me. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to the specific connector on the supply hose. It would be nice if it was a standard air hose fitting to make it more universal.
3,good tool (could be better),i was not altogether pleased once i began using the dictionary due to the fact that i had heard it was also a commentary. it obviously does its job as a dictionary though and i guess that is whats important...it certainly allows the reader to understand more about the proper grammatical use of words and their specific meanings in different texts. it is a valuable tool in any serious study of hermeneutics although i must add that it is not complete in so far as many words cannot be found. those that are included are well defined and the meanings well amplified. an overall useful guide to better understanding biblical text.
3,Diccionario Expositivo Vine,"Diccionario Expositivo De Palabras Del Nuevo Y Antiguo Testamento De Vine¿sAyuda en el studio de la biblia, pero no como complemento, pues muchas palabras no se encuentran en este diccionario."
4,"Awesome Tool, but.....","It is an excellent tool for serious bible study, unfortunatelly the Kindle version it's like a printed book, because almost all links are wrong, that makes complicated nearly impossible to search for specific word, avoiding all benefits of the digital stuff, thus you have to move page by page until you find the word you are lookin for.I would like to get the fixed version of it. What I can do to make it possible ??"
2,Not 16:9 Aspect; Poor & Uneven Lighting,"Now, I'm not quite sure if this TV is the same one as mine, but they look the same and the size (23"") is my size.Anyway, the aspect ratio of my TV is 16:10, not 16:9 like all HD broadcasts are. This means that to not have the picture stretched vertically I have to set it to have two black bars at the top and bottom. Why a company would make anything other than a 16:9 aspect for an HDTV I will never know. Also, in low light scenes you can clearly see the places where the backlights are; they make streaks of bright across the screen. The TV also has some weird feature which turns the backlight up and down depending on what's being displayed, which can be VERY annoying.So I'm not sure if this is the exact same TV, but just be weary if you buy this one (or any LG TV)."
2,pixel went out after 3 hours,One pixel went out after 3 hours. I called customer service and they told me that 3 have to be out before they will consider it a warranty return. It's in the middle of the screen and very annoying.
1,Learned a lesson,"Learned a lesson. Could not find what I wanted locally for bedroom. Worst TV I have ever bought. Color, contrast, do not even know how to start. Never buy a TV with out viewing picture."
1,Ok it's a Porch,Ok so it's a porch and guess what it's way to expensive I don't want to be mean but kids look at the pictures it's way to small for the price of $14.00 and I mean it looks very flimsey like about to fall apart there are a lot of flaws in this toy a lot of the pieces could also get lost or break so think before you buy this porch
2,ME DESILUCIONO LA CALIDAD DEL PRODUCTO,LO COMPRE PARA MI HIJA HACE UN UNOS TRES MESES. CUANDO LLEGO EL RELOJ .AL APRETAR EL PRIMER BOTON SALTO HACIA FUERA DESPRENDIENDOSE ... TUVE QUE LLEVAR A UN RELOJERO QUE LO VUELVA A COLOCAR Y A AJUSTA POR DENTRO TODOS LOS DEMAS BOTONES DEL RELOJ PARA QUE CUANDO MI HIJA LO USE NO ME ACUSE DE HABERLE COMPRADO UN NIKE QUE PARECIA TRUCHO...OK ELLA ESTA CONFORME CON EL MISMO SIN ENVARGO YO HE NOTADO QUE EL RELOJ DESPUES DE UNOS MESES DE USO HOY ESTA RAYADO POR DONDE LE MIRES ES UN PLASTICO COMUN.... BUENO NO QUE ESPERO POR UN RELOJ DE PRECIO TAN BAJO... PERO COMO ERA UN NIKE ESPERABA ALGO MEJOR.
3,NO THE COLOR I WAS EXPECTING,I receive the product in red ... iwa sexpecting rose. but it was on time and perfect conditions. SO i kept it
3,Not up to par for A. S. Byatt,"Most of A. S. Byatt's works belong in my category of ""Favorites"" but this one lacks the depth of her usual writings - perhaps it is because of the genre to which this one belongs. Little Black Book of Stories is a text for a class in my Masters in English studies."
2,I'm not sure if it works......,...because it won't even fit in my high tops to wear it. Really bulky and even though the design seems good it defintely will not fit in my basketball shoes. It might fit in low-tops or cleats since the brace is largest over the ankle bone area. I had to return mine.
1,Way too bulky and didnt stop me from rolling over,This brace is just too bulky and still doesn't keep my foot from rolling over so I returned it. A friend let me try her BioSkin Trilock ankle brace and it was so sweet I got it instead. It fit in my cleat like a glove and I cannot supinate or pronate at all in it! Best of all it washes and dries overnite and since it isn't made of neoprene it doesn't stink. Her daughter's whole team wears them to prevent ankle injuries.
3,Good for girls 5 yrs and under,"My daughter finished this game in an hour. She is 5 yrs old. I thought she wouldn't play it again because it was so easy, but she plays it occassionally. There are better Barbie games like Barbie Beauty Boutique which my daughter plays ALL THE TIME. Skip this one."
1,Don't buy it unless your system is win 95/98,"There are no clear system require in the product information.After I bought it, I figured its win 95/98.The program runs in my win7 barely.The story is stupid, pictures are ugly, mini games are simple but no proper instruction for kids.Don't waste your money!!"
1,"Entertaining, but not educational","Unfortunately, my daughter loves this game and will not choose other software games over this one. What really irritates me is the whole ""Software for Girls"" marketing statement. My daughter loves Barbie, but she is also a very intelligent 5 year old who excels at other appropriately challenging games. What kind of message is Barbie trying to send girls!??!!! To me, it is insulting. You can make it both fun and educational as other character software titles have, such as Blues Clues and the Disney series. You would be much better off choosing a different character that your child loves, such as Dora. Hopefully, the latest titles from Barbie are more challenging."
1,Wary of the fumes,"I completely agree with the previous reviewer who complained of the fumes.Since receiving this oven, I have been afraid of using it due to the toxic, noxious fume it gives off. The smell is so bad, it actually made me sick (headache and nausea)when I first opened it. Maybe the fact that the product is made in India without much quality control (based upon the shoddy workmanship of the product) explains the fumes.I have set the oven out in the sun to air it out for several days, but the fumes remain. I just can't see how I could eat food that is cooked in this vapor of fume. The oven may cook well like it claims, but I wouldn't know. It doesn't seem safe so I'm not going to use it for cooking.Update:Sun DB Corporation has worked with me to completely resolve the issue I had with the fumes. They have replaced my old oven with a new one and baked it out to eliminate any odor. I can only commend them on their excellent service."
3,should have waited,"I ordered the Tulsi-Hybrid before I read the reviews, I should have waited. It was shipped fast and nothing was broken but as other people have said, the quality is very poor. I already have the ""Global Sun Oven"" and there is no comparison to them. I wish they had not included the thin cheap pots and put that value in better hinges, I hope they last the year, but I doubt it. They remind me of a child's toy suit case that is made of plastic. I will use it but will have to be careful. I did not have a problem with the smell, I followed instructions and turned it on and lifted the lid to let out fumes. On high I was only able to get it to 275 degrees. I plan on using it only in the sun, so this was not a concern. It is such a great idea if only they would improve the quality and not use such cheap parts! Like I said before, it's my fault, I should have read the reviews first."
1,Embarrassingly Poor Workmanship,"I love and have lived in India so my expectations were already low for this oven. But right out of the box I could see that this was not made in a modern factory for the Western consumer. Every aspect of the construction was shoddy and would not have held up to even occasional use. For an Indian villager who has no other option I'm sure this would be a God-send, but as my title says this was just embarrassing. Flat black paint cannot be wiped clean as it just comes off by merely touching it. The hardware was mismatched and already rusting. Even the black electrical tape on the glass for shipping was a joke. I could continue, but I think the point is clear. Run from this disaster of a product. (On the positive side, customer service from Sun Corp. was fantastic and made returning the unit as easy as could be. Thanks.)"
4,Tulsi solar cooker,"I have cooked dozens of meals in my solar cooker and I love it. It is a well-made and built to last. My only reservation is that I never use the electric adaptor. When (if) this unit ever wears out, I would love a tulsi product that is just solar- not hybrid."
5,Lovely!,"I bought this ring on a whim, knowing that for the price I paid, it probably would not be much of a much, but liking the simplicity of it. When it arrived, I was stunned. This ring is beautiful. It is a solitaire that sparkles and is just the right size not to look fake but still large enough to draw compliments. I am wearing it now and feel quite proud of myself for buying this bargain and getting a really gorgeous ring. If you like the picture, this is exactly what you will get."
5,Sublime!,"Belle Chase Hotel is probably the best portuguese band that came out in the nineties. Mixing cabaret music, jazz, bossanova, pop, rock and lots of style, the band led by JP Simes managed to debut with an exquisite and timeless work of art."
2,decent first effort for young writer,"China doesn't make an appearance until the last chapter, and the buildup in the preceding stories lacks strength. However, Heller's disciplined, confident writing style is to be praised.Beginning with a lacklustre but nicely personal story about buying a pickup truck, Heller writes of his life as a sensitive he-man seeking adventure. The China rafting story is the best part of the book.Might be a good read for high-school age boys. A warning to animal lovers: contains descriptions of hunting."
3,Great Pig ... no mounting device.,"Perfect item ... how do you attach it to the roof? The last pig vane I bought came w/ a mounting device, so I assume (wrongly) that all pig vane's were sold equally. Oh well ... off to find a way to attach the flying pig to the barn roof."
5,good looking sweater,"The green sweater is just what I was looking for--the size and color, also the material were nice. I was very pleased and the service was great."
1,The opposite of entertaining.,"This book is very very boring, its not just boring its annoying and the story line is very predictable and dragged on. I kept reading in hope that it might just get better...only it didnt. It is the worst of the Sabrina series and you should not read it, instead you should read 'Prisoner of cabin 13' or 'sabrina goes to Rome' those are the best, as well as 'showdown at the mall' but any of the Sabrina series is better than 'Dogs life""."
3,Dog and boy........boy and dog,Harvey is petsitting McDougal. When he brings him to Sabrina's house she accidental changes them over. Now its Harvey the dog and McDougal the boy. Can she change them back without her aunts knowing? Thats for me to know and you to buy the book and read it!!!
4,Changes and facades,"Another masterpiece from Mrs. Mazer! This one is about a young girl named Toni whose best friend Julie moved away because her parents divorced. Toni was grateful for her loving, stable home. Her parents would never divorce like Julie's. But was her family really what it appeared to be? A visit with her emotionally distant older sister Martine provided surprising answers. Toni struggled to get along with her parents when she went back home. Later in the story, Julie returned to a changed friend. Will Toni's family and friendship ever be the same? I reccomend you read the book and find out how Toni survived."
5,Great compliment to book,"I hesitated buying these dvds because i already own the book. However, these dvds really do add to the text. While there are no new exercises included, donna does add useful tips and insightful information throughout the ""class"" which i have not found within the book. As well, there is something about watching the exercises preformed live that really speaks to me... i remember so much more and appreciate so much more after watching the material, rather than only reading it."
5,Energy Healing by Donna Eden,she did it again she shows you how in great detail love it and makes it easy to learn
5,We cannot take a trip in the car without this CD,My grandkids LOVE this CD - Songs for the Car. I had another CD with some of the same songs on it and it somehow broke. The kids were devastated. I was so happy to find it on Amazon and the price was awesome. It arrived so quickly that we were back in song in no time. Great to keep kids busy on a long or short car ride.
5,As only a warrior can tell it!,"This book is a must read for EVERY American. Adm Stockdale was/is a courageous man and his wife a courageous lady. What is discribed in this book is just so amazing that if I didn't know it was a true story, I would think the writer had a bizarre imagination.As another review said, this book is written as only one who lived it can write it. A true warrior! A true story! A AMAZING read."
3,not for a mexi bridge,This didn't fit a any of my mexi bridges but the company resolved the issue so not much else to say
1,Not Vintage,"I received the same item from Musicians Friend, same part number, ziplock bag packaging. 1.) It is not shaped like the Vintage Tremolo arm on my Jimmie Vaughan. 2.) the thread seems to be metric and is larger than US. Fits my MIJ trem but not my US. I have two other US vintage trems and this bar will not fit."
4,Works with APC Back-UPS XS 800,Works great with APC Back-UPS XS 800- no problems. Very easy to install. Very good price at $65.50 w/ free shipping (received order within a couple of days after placing order!). Hope it lasts a few years...
5,Satisfied,"Working fine for my APC Back-UPS 800 XS. The package included paperwork for using the APC battery recycle return program. My original battery worked for 3 years, I didn't stress it much."
5,Replacement battery.,"This battery was just what we needed! The back-up source has been beeping just about non-stop so I was thrilled when this arrived in the mail, swapped batteries and walla... no more beeping!!"
3,will buy in case of emergency,got what i paid for. It woks fine. will buy it again. did the job. best to buy new back system.
5,Just slap it in the case,"Could not be easier to replace an APC battery.Open the case, find the plug, close the door...."
5,It was what it was suppose to be,It is an OEM part and cheaper than buying direct from the OEM web site.
1,BATTERY CAME AND DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE.,This is crazy...battery came and will not hold a charge. But it is non-returnable. It also looked like it was used.
1,9 Months - unit died,"This unit was the first replacement into my APC XS 800 Back Ups ... After nine months, any power fluctuation would cause the unit to quit. While I'm curious to know if I spent another $60 would the new RBC32 make everything OK.. or is it the BackUps itself? I gambled the other way- and replaced it with a Cyberpower 1500 with a display to show load, charge, remaining run time, etc. I'm just moving on from the ""alarm"" light and instant, unforeseeable death of the standard UPS."
1,Be careful on buying this for the APC Backup-UPS XS 900,"Be careful the description for this battery reads ""Replacement Battery Cartridge for Back-ups Rs/xs 500-1000VA (RBC32)"". Which would lead one to assume that it works in the XS 900; it does not as the size and connectors do not match. For my UPS-Backup XS 900 I needed to order a RBC5 replacement battery. If you have the original instructions double check which battery you need; don't rely on the online documentation.Amazon was very good in helping me resolve the problem.The rating is really an N/A as it is the wrong battery. I can't really rate the quality of the battery."
1,Short life,"While the original UPS battery lasted more than three years, this replacement lasted less than four months. The UPS was run at less than 20 percent capacity and handled only one blackout. Also, it seems that APC no longer includes a free UPS shipping label for returning old batteries, though there is an option for dropping off at a local Staples store."
1,Cannot return!!!,"We bought this product installed it, but it did not work. We attempted to return this item, but Amazon does not allow returns of hazardous materials. You can order this product and receive it through the mail, but Amazon will not allow you to return it,something about returning hazardous material through the mail. Beware of the return policies!!! We now have a very expensive paper weight. Very disappointed!!!"
1,Defective Battery,"If I had it to do over again, I'd either get the replacement battery from APC or I'd get another UPS instead. (I did the latter from Amazon - the BR1500G). The RBC32 replacement battery from Amazon was defective on arrival. The other folks here who say that Amazon will not accept the battery return due to hazardous materials is correct. They did, however, provide me a full refund of the purchase cost.The person at Amazon that I spoke with told me they don't accept the return is because they'd have to handle recycling of the battery and they don't have infrastructure in place to do this.However, you can send the battery for recycling free of charge by contacting APC."
2,Doesn't last long,"Worked great for about 10 months. Now the UPS ""replace battery"" light is on again. What's up with the ""expected life: 3-5 years"" ??"
1,Defective,"I installed the battery in the backup unit and ran all the tests to confirm that it was working. After 3 weeks the backup unit began alarming and showing overload status. After disconnecting everything from the unit it was still showing overload and alarming, then I disconnected the battery and the backup stopped alarming and the overload condition went away. I went to return the battery and discovered that I cannot because it is considered hazardous by Amazon. I then emailed the APC to find out how to get a replacement and the response from APC was that the would help me determine what is wrong with the backup unit."
4,Replacement the Works,"Installed this RPC in my Backups XS-800. Very easy to install, just remove the old Battery and install and connect the new battery in its place. It works!!!!!"
4,all the diamond head originals metallica covered one one cd,a good retrospective look at a majoe metallica influence.considering they wrote these song long before they were cover they are pretty impressive but unless you like nwobhm style music you should pass this over but for kick you may love it
3,Is this the REALLY the end!!??,"Watching the last DVD of the Gunlock series was a relief and a let down. Relief because the series was getting boring. A let down and this is a SPOILER, they 1)Never Got to India (the west); 2)They never fought Kou and his gang for the ultimate winner of the Scripture; 3) They never let us know what the crazy lab scientist was getting to; 4)The Gyumoah guy was never revived or killed. I think if a few of these had happened I think I would have been satisfied. All those episodes with Hazel and Gato could have at least got them closer to at least one of the conclusions but that was not the case. If your a fan of the original series then RENT this third season."
3,Could have been much better,"The music comes as a mere 128K MP3 in four different mixes. Why not a high quality 384K MP3? I bought a disc, it would be nice to have at least CD quality files. Sorry folks, a 128K MP3 is NOT CD quality.The videos are standard definition Flash files and kind of fuzzy. The picture and sound isn't so great. You'd think you'd get DiVX or MPEG-2 files or even high-definition for the space on the disc. I certainly expected high quality and only got mediocre for both the videos and music.Too bad, because the music and videos are fantastic, very entertaining, and quite sexy. Despite this, not worth the money they are charging. After saying that, I'd be willing to pay more for a disc with high quality files on them. Nevertheless, you pay too much for this. It doesn't give you any more than what is on YouTube."
3,Could have included more. Seperate parts a bad idea.,"Unfortunately Part 1 contains only two tracks - the Radio Edit & Club Mix. When a cd single releases two parts like this, it's never a good sign. Why would I pay twice the money for what could have fitted all onto one disc? Part 2 contains lots of tempting remixes, but really I'm happy with the fantastic radio edit of this luscious beat banging-tune. Certainly the mash-up of the decade. It will be in your head for days, and that's it's redeeming value."
5,hot!,"for someone, like me, that does not normally listen/watch dance music and their videos - this song and video has really given me a fresh view on the sihts and sounds."
3,Athena Speaker System,The mounting brackets could have been a little larger allowing easier access to the area of putting a screw into the wall. Their audio performance was so-so I expected better from reading all the reviews.
5,It was great,In this cd the Canadian Brass does a great job of playing Duke Ellington's music. If you like the Canadian Brass you will love this cd!
1,MAKE SURE TO PREVIEW THESE SONGS!!!,"Most of these are NOT the songs you've heard on the radio, or on regular album releases.Preview them all before deciding."
5,This Classic Voice Keeps On Going,"Larry Chance and the Earls were one of the classic doo-wop groups from the early 1960's. Larry kept the group singing through the British Invasion, Motown, then 70's, 80's, 90's and beyond. Through his love of many traditional standards as well as singing them, his albums are still coming out. Many of his com-parts have performed with Larry through the years. And Larry is all New York. Go listen to the sound track the movie ""A Bronx Tale"". You will never get tired of this sound. And Larry's voice is getting more mellow and mature. He will never lose the touch. Check out all of his albums as well as his early 45 RPM singles."
5,take a chance,"this cd contains the best ""new"" oldie to date ........... moonlight kiss is a great accomplishment done by one of the best groups ever ............... wait til you hear the other sides on this one ....... great rendition of lost love"
2,Watch screw lugs T bars?,"So what are ""watch screw lugs T bars?"" Order this item and be surprised. I did, and I was. I thought I was ordering a watch repair kit with screws included. No screws. This appears to be a case of Chinenglish translation. I don't think the vendor even knows what they are selling. Not worth returning."
2,One book too many,"Number two of a trilogy is usually weaker than number one, but often the third installment reaches new heights. Not this time, the author should have stopped at two.The time travel theory, invented in ""The Whispers"" and expanded in ""Faces of Infinity"", is scrambled to poetic incoherence in ""Paradox Gate"". The pseudo-science of the first two books is no longer consistent, so I revoke poetic license. To his credit, the author makes it clear that none of the characters fully understand the revised theory, though that doesn't stop them from explaining it to each other in great detail.The plot is nonsensical. The characters, never a strong point in this series, have deteriorated further - primarily because the author has finally made an attempt to flesh them out.Nevertheless, I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the first two. It continues a narrative that remains intriguing and presents additional amusing anomolies."
4,This book will help beginners,"I'm a beginner and I believe Heisman's advice will improve your game. He understands the beginner's chess-mind and makes you aware of how you go wrong.He writes a column for chesscafe.com. Taken togther, all his columns cover 90% of what's in this book. Since I've read all the columns (and previously purchased his ""A Parent's Guide To Chess"") I felt as if I got little extra for the price. Nonetheless, I don't mind supporting the guy since I think he is doing chess a great service."
5,Truly a Second Chess Book,"I am using this book as an aid to help my children learn chess. After teaching them the basic moves and letting them experience beginner play, I am using this book to help them understand the game a little deeper. It has been the perfect tool. Don't buy this if you are just learning the game. You will not understand it. Learn the basics first, practice the basics, then buy this book."
4,Heisman Looks at the Process of Chess Improvement,"This is a great book for chess parents and teachers, particularly those who are teaching youngsters. The author discusses several topics that I have not seen anywhere else. These topics are about how people learn chess and the levels of chess knowledge rather than they are about technical aspects of the game.The concepts presented include chess vision, thoroughly knowing the rules, playing according to principles that suit the situation, and the etiquette of chess play. The author shows how to build chess vision by using ""chess mazes"", but I would really have liked to see more of these. The other concepts are illustrated with concrete examples from the author's experience as a chess teacher.I would highly recommend this book to an improving adult or the parent of a young chess player."
4,Decent Pendant,"The pendant is small but fairly heavy for its size. Well crafted and eye catching. Several people who have seen me wearing it have wanted a closer look and always compliment the fine pendant. I love the claw and two feathers that dangle from the pendant - it adds to the Native American appeal. I do agree with the other reviewer who said the design on the pendant more resembles a werewolf than a wolf... and the claw hanging from the pendant is definitely not a wolf claw: it seems to be a humanoid-lupine hybrid. My only complaint is the thin black rope that the pendant comes tied to. The string-like necklace will snap very easily. It is adjustable, so that's good... but I have to be careful not to fray of snap the rope. You are better off buying a different rope necklace or even a chain, rather than using the one provided. But all in all, I am pleased."
1,Beware!!!,"I purchased 4 of these batteries to replace old ones in my Vtech I5881 phones. They hold a charge for less than an hour. 2 of them won't even charge at all. Seeing as my expandable phone system ( in perfect condition) is no longer available and I cannot find batteries, I had to order a whole new set of phones after spending nearly $44 on worthless batteries!Don't waste your money!"
1,Not Compatible with Motorola MD671,"I purchased this item as a replacement battery for my Motorola MD671 cordless telephone handset.The battery fits the battery enclosure of the handset (barely... doesn't fit perfectly) but it will not operate the handset. Power seems to be getting through, but even after leaving it in the cradle over-night it will not operate the handset. The handset flashes ""Motorola"" as the other battery does when it first initializes, but it will not proceed with the initialization of the handset beyond that, nor does the handset work.My review is to NOT buy this item if you have a Motorola MD671 cordless telephone."
1,Terrible,"The only reason I bought this was because it was the only battery for my cordless phone that was shipped with Amazon Prime. Big mistake. Don't waste your money on this battery. It lasted about 9 months of decent charge. Now my phone beeps that the battery is low after 5 minutes of use, even after sitting on the charger all day."
2,doesn't fit 5840 base station,"unfortunately i am way past the return window, but if it will prevent others making the same mistake....this battery does not fit into the AT&T 5840 base station, back-up battery slot. The slide out battery compartment will not close with this battery in it, so it is a little too deep. It will fit into a handset though, i just tried it."
4,Great item - terrible shipping cost,"Battery works great - and price of BATTERY was fabulous (under $1). BUT I was annoyed that the shipping cost was close to $10 though! I originally was going to purchase 2 of these batteries, but for 2 batts, instead of shipping staying same for 2 batts or perhaps just a little more than shipping cost for only 1 batt, shipping cost would have been DOUBLE! Keep in mind that this item is only the size of 2 AA batteries wrapped together! Ridiculous!"
5,Enjoyable,"This book takes you both where you expect and don't expect to go, but you will love the journey! I have a much better understanding and appreciation for pronghorn and their Montana ecosystem. There are complexities that I had never fully considered. My thanks to John Byers for an enjoyable experience!"
2,New and Bad Stereo Recordings by the Original Artist!,Be forewarned that there is nothing original about these recordings. Radio soul is an interesting title as no one has ever heard these particular recordings played on any radio station anywhere. These repackaged songs sound like crap compared to the originals. I gave this two stars because Smokey Robinson uses the original music from You Really Got a Hold on Me.Eel
3,Hmmmmm....,"This cross was very cute. I took one star away because it was much smaller than it looked (I couldn't find any measurements). And the other because I was a bit disappointed in the value. So if you're aware of the size and price and in love with it anyway, maybe it's for you."
5,Thanks for the help,"Going to Korea to teach was a big decision for me, if not a bit scary, and coming across this book made a difficult transition much easier. From tips on where to begin the job search, to helpful classroom hints, to the ins and out of everyday living in Korea, ""Korea Calling"" became an invaluable tool for me during my year of teaching there. Teaching Engish Korea is a great adventure, grab a copy of this book and DO IT!"
5,Korea Calling,This book was so helpful and very down-to-earth with real advice rather than irrelevance. Excellent for anyone desiring to go to Korea!
4,A must have for English Teachers,This book is great for the person that is considering moving to Korea to teach English. It helps you determine that maybe you aren't completely insane by wanting to move to a completely foreign culture half way around the globe.
4,Going to Korea,"Received the book fast and in condition listed, thanks. Book gives great information for ESL teachers wanting to teach in Korea."
2,short and a little silly,Was watching with my grandchildren and EVEN they didn't like it. Would not recommend to anyone not even children. Save your money
3,Descent,Short but cute. I enjoyed the newer one more. More story to enjoy. For 2 dollars it was worth the money.
2,cute,My five year liked it but I didn't. It was very strange but I guess that's what I expect from a Tim Burton movie.
3,Frankenweenie review,I thought this was a cute short movie. Could have been a little longer. Loved Sparky. I would not recommend this movie.
3,Simple Movie,My family was watching movies and we ran across this one. This is not the newly released movie of 2012. This movie was not a high budget movie. It was simple and short but my son liked it because he had experienced a death of a beloved dog. It is more like a very strange Leave it to Beaver type show.
1,Don't get ripped off,"Horrible unbelievable characters does not date the film, in the 1930's they hired real actors. Just a solid piece of crap, Worthy of a high school project but not worthy of 1.99 rental, and definitively sub par for a renowned director."
1,Misrepresented,"The description of this battery is NiMH (nickel metal hydride), but upon delivery it is just a nickel cadmium battery. (A by far inferior battery for those that do not know.) I have written e-mail to the seller about 5 days ago regarding returning it and they have not yet responded. Although their customer service e-mails state they will ""respond immediately."" This sort of thing is illegal in retail stores. I will never purchase from this seller again and I recommend that everyone else avoid them."
5,Old phone works like new,We had a phone that was failing because of the battery. I purchase a new battery and the phone works like new!!
1,An Inadvertently Hilarious Pile of Nonsense,"This book is poorly researched, relies on highly questionable sources and indulges in absurd leaps of reasoning to support its conclusions, such as they are-they take up a whole, pretty much unrelated-to-the-rest-of-the-book three pages at the very end-that British worshippers of Hekate are sacrificing people and small animals in order to run the world.Sort of like David Icke, but not as well-written."
2,Eh,"Not much to it...its a box, with velcro...I knew this before buying, but if you hold out, you can find a barenger (i probably spelled that wrong) pedal board for pretty cheap with all of the electronics needed...If you are on a limited budget, and have no more than 8-ish pedals, this would be a good product for you."
2,Flimsy and Awkward,"While this board was not costly, the thin aluminum construction, coupled with the awkward half-hinge design makes this pedal board a pain to use. The velcro system in place on this board is nowhere approaching good enough for a gig, and unless you've got several heavy pedals, this board is going all over the place just from regular use. I went through the trouble of making permanent mounts for my pedals, which was a poor investment in time since the overall quality of the board was unsatisfactory to begin with. Look elsewhere."
4,Great piece for the price,This a good product for the price I paid. I didn't have a big budget so this product helped me.
1,essential collection by vaughn monroe,I would be really pleased if at least one of the places where I ordered the cd from would have delivered!!!!!!!! After ordering it twice and neither place could produce the cd I've given up in hopes that some time in the near future somebody will have it for sale at an affordable price!!
4,Easy read:,Circle of Five is enjoyable and an easy read. There is adventure yet not the blood and gore that is in many books. There is romance without all the explicite sex. I truly enjoyed reading it this weekend.
5,Quality T.V. entertainment,"I really enjoyed watching this series again. It was unique and well done when it first aired, with good scripts and terrific actors. I found watching 'The Sentinel' nostalgic but by no means dated. The quality of the dvd (picture & sound)was great, and I look foward to the release of the second and third seasons."
5,At Last! Sentinel on dvd!,"I have waited for AGES to get this on dvd. This was a very overlooked series when it was on, and it now has a HUGE cult following, particularly in Texas, of all places.I can't wait to get this!"
5,It's about friendship!,"This show is about so much more than just your average ""get the bad guys"" cop show... It has so much more to offer, but I guess that it is hard for some to grasp the deep friendship build from nothing and all the different characters preformanses...Richard Burgi is just great as Detective Ellison - and yes, he is a bit stiff (or whatever) sometimes... but that is just so Ellison like..And Garett Maggart is super as Blair Sandburg - his enthusiasm, energy and way of seeing things is refreshing and you just have to love him...The extra twist of the show are the senses and if you took 'em away, I agree it might have been a dull show, but with them.. - oh, man (blair style)..If you, like me, like buddy shows with a good plot and a lot of action.Then this is something for you!"
4,Good Start,"The Sentinel was one of those fun shows from the late 1990's; fun cop drama with lots of humor. There was some cheesy-ness, but over all it was a good series.As for the DVD's pictures and sound is superb. Honestly, the picture quality is better than when the series ran on UPN, and the sound, while only being 2 channel is still wide open and fills the room nicely.However, there are no special features here and no close captioning. Fans know there are blooper reels in existance and I hope for future seasons we see some extras. Commentaries with Richard Burgi, Garett Maggert, and Bruce A Young would be nice as well"
3,It's OK for the price,"I bought this because I already had one, and I didn't want to mess around learning the commands to set it up on my monitoring software. Plus, I thought it was a pretty good camera for the price. It's big weakness is compatibility with 3rd party software. There are only a few programs that work with it. I probably wouldn't buy another one - I've been forced to do a lot of investigation since I bought this (I needed some cameras for exterior use), and found that it's worth extra money to buy better cameras in the first place. If you're going to try to ID someone from the camera's picture, this Hawking camera isn't going to do a very good job of it. Decent optics cost money, period."
2,"quirky, unimpressive camera.","I have chalked this camera up to my 'failed attempts' file, as it never really worked for my needs. I could get it to operate as advertised when wired, but wireless never reliably worked. It would run fine for a day or two, but then stop for no obvious reason. The software was also very clunky. I eventually purchased a linksys wireless camera that - although far from perfect - is at least reliable. The price point may seem attractive, but I would spend a little more on a different brand."
4,Classy,"There's nothing wrong with them. They move everywhere. Really? Did I really say that? I don't want to sound...yes, their very nice, and versatile and stylish and the faucet moves around and that's a good thing."
1,I wish there was zero stars...,"This is one of the most horrible things I've ever attempted to eat. It practically sucks the moisture out of your mouth, and the texture is like chewing sand without the crunch. It has this awful tangy but bland flavor, and is barely swallowable. I'm glad things like this are available to people who have many allergies and intolerances, but I feel so sorry for them having to eat it. We only tried this bread during the elimination phase of an oligoantigenic diet, and even if I could never have bread again, I'd rather eat peanut butter and jelly plain, than put it on this disgusting stuff. Horrid. Absolutely horrid."
1,Gluten free rice bread,This bread tasted horrible. No one in my family would touch it. I ended up just throwing it all out.
2,Edible but not delicious,I've tasted worse things but I would not buy this again. Dull flavor. Does not satisfy bread craving for the gluten free.
1,Yuck!!!!,"This bread is a terrible tasting bread. I needed a yeast free bread because of my allergic reaction to it. But upon my reading it, I saw that it has leaven in it. I ate it without this prior knowledge and had an allergic reaction. This is not yeast free because it has leaven. Yeast is leaven. On top of that it's extremely grainy and tastes terrible. How do people eat this? Kinnikinnick has a yeast free tapioca bread that tastes loads better for anyone who cares."
5,Wilton quality,"This is a nice pan and worked perfectly. It's pretty thin metal, so it could bend/ding easily. I followed the decorating instructions and the cake turned out great."
5,A MUST!,"This is such a great activity book. My 20-month old got it for Christmas, along with a bunch of toys... yet THIS has been his favorite. He LOVES singing along, doing the motions, and has to have the book with him ALL the time - even a 4.5 hour car trip (made us a little crazy... but we still LOVE that he opts for this book over a toy of some sort.)"
4,fun and very educational,"this is a great beginners resource for information regarding human evolution. without going into great detail, this book pretty much covers all the general information anyone would want to know about human evolution. i enjoyed coloring, although i was a little confused by the directions at first, as this isn't a child's coloring book, like it says in the description. for those of us that learn better by a combination of formats (reading and activities), this us a great resource."
4,Good study guide,"Like most of the Science coloring books this is a great supplement to a full text and course. The material is presented in nice bite size pieces and it does cover a wide range of topics. Some people do not like the subject of the book, but that is immaterial if someone is taking a physical anthropolgy course. If you need to study, buy the book."
5,Great bargain for my classroom!,I have been trying to complete the Book of Virtue Series from the nineties that I purchased parts of over several years. I am still missing a few but the two I purchased are in excellent condition and priced just right. I hope to find a few more to use in my guidance/character education classes in elementary school.
2,Bad Zipper,Item shipped with a stuck bottom zipper. So lower compartment is not accessable. The jam is so bad to try to open would break the zipper.The only fix is to return and I'm too lazy to return on this cheap of an item. To bad quality control didn't catch this before shipping. The bag can still be used but the extra space in the bottom would have made it ideal. A true 5 star if zipper had not been jammed.
4,Kodak Camera Bag,"Compact and easy to carry. Solid construction. Only drawback, bottom zipper compartment too small for recommended Kodak KLIC-8000 battery charger and power cord. Would recommend to others."
3,Nice little case but...,"I bought this to store a Kodak Z1485 which it stored quite well along with its USB cable/included accessories, and the K8500 charger + battery fit well in the small compartment in the bottom. However, the zipper of that compartment would repeatedly and consistently get stuck in the closed position, likely due to faulty construction. Each time it stuck I had to dig the zipper free with a knife-point. I tried to make a few small stitches in order to block the zipper from rolling over the area it would get stuck on while being able to nearly completely zip the bottom compartment shut, but that was not helpful either. If I had taken this case out with me to shoot pictures, I would probably have to destroy the thing in order to be able to change my battery, etc. In the end this case was returned."
5,"perfect fit, well made",The perfect little bad for my Kodak ZD710 with sufficient space in the bottom compartment for lenses and other stuff.
3,Too stuffed,"Cute little bag but the Kodak Z612 does not fit in too easily, i should have gotten the medium bag. the carrying handle is at the back, i would prefer it if it was on the sides."
3,Great bag - just right for the Z812IS camera,"Though this bag is ""compatible"" with the Z812IS - even on the Kodak website, I found it to be an extremely tight fit. I'd rather have an eight of an inch margin around my camera so I don't have to literally shoe-horn it in!That being said, this is probably not the fault of the bag - which is a great bag by itself! Just not the best bet for the Z812IS.UPDATE on 2/21: I've now used this bag for the past 2 weeks and need to change my opinion. I think the bag has ""loosened"" up just a little bit - and i now find it very easy and convenient to use this for the Z812IS. Plus the fact that I can fit myInsten Battery Charger for Kodak KLIC-8000andKodak KLIC-8000 Equivalent Li-ion Batteryin the bottom compartment makes this a winner!I'd change the rating to a 5* if I could."
1,Kodak 1348762 Graphite Camera Bag,"Kodak 1348762 Graphite Camera Bag - Small (Black)Owned the original Kodak bag similar to this one. The back strap finally wore out after a few years. I ordered this bag expecting the same quality and design. The Bottom zipper did not open at all, not even once. The design of the back of the case (which did not show in pics) requires unbuckling of your belt to remove the case (not so with the first Kodak bag design). This bag exhibits poor design and functionality. I was very unhappy with the quality and I returned the case in original packaging. Amazon was excellent and issued credit immediately upon return of the product. I managed to sew the original one to be usable until we find a better carrying case."
3,Fits Vertically Tight!,"It fits tightly on my Kodak Z1012 IS on vertical position, & I also removed the attached ""cusion support"" inside to make it fit! Other than that, it has good SD card & battery storage, resonably priced, well made camera bag!"
5,Another easy to understand Zola book,Zola Levitt has done an outstanding job of taking the seven feasts of Israel and making them easy to understand and how they apply to Christians.
3,informed and disappointed,This starts out to be very informative on the feasts then falls very short. This paper is really a muse for Zola to peddle a theory book publishers he admitted refused to consider so he thought he would hide it in something people are interested in... I expected more granular information on the feasts. on the other hand it was not much money so maybe a wash....
5,Pins,"Yup. Lots of pins. Only needed one to fix my daughters $9 watch. Spent $9 on pins. They worked as expected, plus I have a lot more pins. Who doesn't want that?"
2,dont have my size,"there is nothing ""wrong"" with the product. just dont have my size. this product only go's to size 19mm, i needed at least a 25 mm., my fault should of measured my watch. Remember if you have a large watch you should order at leastj a jumbo set that starts off well over 19mm!"
4,WATCH PINS,I really haven't had the opportunity to use any of them yet. I purchased them so that I will have just about any size on hand when the need arises. The price is excellent.
3,Not a good buy.,"I got this kit to adjust a few of my watches, it could not do the job had to take it to the shop for adjustment. This product is cheap and very poor quality. I would not recommend it."
2,no variety,"Although the spring bars came in various lenghts, every bar was the same thickness. Since the bars were too thick for my watch, NONE of them could be used. Thus, I have 100 useless spring bars!"
3,Gets the job done,"I bought a vintage 70's Seiko automatic watch that did not come with a watchband. I bought a watchband on Amazon that did not come with pins so I had to buy these. I found a pair of pins for half this price but you get so much for only double price. First is these are made in India so not the highest quality. I had to use the 19mm pins on the 18mm watchband. Only thing is that you will most likely not use most of these pins. Mens watches use 18mm to 24mm pins. This company should break down a set of small pins for kids & ladies & a set for mens. I feel the springs in these could be a little firmer, in the future I am going to buy just a pair of pins & see if it is more solid & better quality."
2,Heplful Hints or Quick Check,I bought this for my Kinda and it seemed like a good idea. It makes a quick guide book for simple vocab word checks but for a more detailed info this is not it. Sorry this is not college level.
3,It Does Fit,"In same position as previous reviewer, Peter Chen. The SMALL footprint of my existing (discontinued) BE325 UPS the critical factor, so no choice but to buy this battery.I will note that the ORIGINAL battery was a Vision CP1232 battery, NOT an APC labeled battery. However, for a price difference of $10 (what I could find the Vision battery for, including shipping), I decided to go with the APC battery, though, no doubt, all made in the same factory in China.As delivered, the APC battery would not fit into the UPS. Only when fiddling with it did I notice that the plastic covers on the spade poles would slide all the way forward, allowing the battery to slip into the case.Except in the case where you have a BE325 and need to keep it, MUCH better served by buying a new UPS."
1,Not Worth it because....,You can buy a brand new unit (includes new battery) from Circuit City for less money than this replacement battery.Sad to say it but it's better to just recycle this one and get a new one completely.
2,"It works, but not a long time","I bought this battery in Sept 2010. Fit in my APC UPS perfectly.Battery lasted about 13 months then started beeping all the time and would not hold a charge.The original battery lasted almost 3 years.This is just a backup for a cable modem, wireless router and Vonage box with little use over the year.I am debating getting another one of these or finding a different one."
2,"Yeah, maybe on the cover","I used this book for my high school curiculum and will use the exact same book in my collge calc class. And I have enough experience to say that, although this book seems to be user-friendly, it is by far not. The layout is relatively simple, however is not very in depth. Additionally, this book smashes together several large topics together with very little explanation. This lack of explanation, in turn, makes some of the problems practically impossible due to the fact that you haven't seen any problems like them before. All in all forget this book, and pay attention to your instructor."
2,Not that helpful for trying to teach yourself,"This book assumes a knowledge that not everyone will have. It has an algebra/pre-calc review section, but the review is very basic (ie what an exponent is). The problems require you to remember about negative exponents and cube roots and whatnot.The explanation parts are very simple and the problems are much more complex.It's hard to make the connection, and the answers in the back don't explain anything. (Don't buy the solutions manual - it's not any more help.) The answers are also simplified in inconsistent ways, so it's sometimes hard to use even if you have the problem right. Calculus for Dummies was more helpful, and explains a little better. It's still not as in depth as the problems in Brief Calculus, though.(Sidenote: I'm ""trying to teach myself"" because my professor is incomprensible and has illegible writing as well.)"
3,Excellent for Business majors,"This text is an excellent text for business majors of all disciplines. It features real world applications and examples to learn from, and comprehensive excersises to demonstrate mastery of the material. The text is jam packed with helpful and clear illustrations and pictures."
3,jWin review,"Overall it's ok. I bought it because of the low price, the turntable and the fact it has a remote.The options are ok, but the DISC SKIP button fell in after the SECOND time I used it. The tape deck buttons look like they're going to fall off any minute now, so be gentle.I am not sure what else to say"
2,So-so quality and style - definitely not worth MSRP $219,"So the jacket is lined and for the most part, satisfactorily-made. But definitely not worth an MSRP of $219. I would not have paid more than $30 for it. I would have expected more from JONES NEW YORK. The jacket I received was not exactly as pictured -- it had white buttons instead of black buttons as in the picture. I am petite, so the sleeves go down to my wrist which is fine, but I think it was meant to go to the mid-arm. Nice fit around the waist. The wing collar looks kinda funky and I wasn't too thrilled with the cuffs on the sleeves. Wrinkles easily. I'll be returning it to Amazon."
5,Great follow-up to VB6 Business Objects,"In a nutshell, if you just read and liked Visual Basic 6 Business Objects, get a hold of this book.Basically, this book is following Lhotka's architecture while adding new features to it's implementation. Features such as State Rollback, Load Balancing, and obviously, more objects usage on a distributed environment.You will also find some good usage of MSMQ and web-oriented objects.The only thing still missing is to see where the authors would fit XML into all this."
5,Simply Outstanding,"The concepts and ideas presented in this book (as well as the Business Objects book) should be in the ""toolbox"" of every serious Visual Basic developer. The examples are concise and the concepts are easy to read and understand. I recently developed an n-tier e-commerce web application using the author's concepts for the middle tier. This was my first full-scale, enterprise-level effort, and I found the architecture easy to implement and the performance and scalability to be superb.Incidentally, the support from the author and publisher are excellent as well. When I had a question about the subject matter in the book, I e-mailed the author. I received a personal reply from Mr. Lhotka, with a detailed answer to my question, in just a couple of days."
3,functional but not perfect,I would have liked something stronger - with our north breezes the door will open. It takes some getting used to as well.
4,good and depressing,"I love Peanuts. Always have. But this doesn't have the feel-good charm that is present in all the other classic Charlie Brown stories. This one is genuinely sad at times. The scene where they say goodbye to our favorite beagle... Anyway, that being said, it's very good, and it ends well. I'd still rather watch A Boy Named Charlie Brown."
5,Snoppy Come Home,"This is a really cute movie. I remember from my childhood, my children really love the movie. I still remember all the old songs and now my kids sing along too. Great movie! Brings back great memories."
5,The saddest film EVER,"This is such the saddest film ever! Not only that but I remember watching it as a little one and it brings all the memories flooding back, though I think the first time I ever cried at it was when I dug my old tape that I recorded off the TV 10 years ago out of the video cabinet and found it still worked!! So now its high time I got a proper version without constant advert breaks. Long live Snoopy! And Woodstock's sooooo cute!"
4,"Fine Peanuts film, but it's tough to stomach lack of extras","The second ""Peanuts"" feature film carries a true emotional punch that the first (""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"") did not and benefits hugely from the musical stylings of the Sherman Bros. team. This may not be saying much, but I rank it second amongst all theatrical feature films of the 1970s, behind only ""Watership Down"". Unfortunately, you won't learn anything about the story behind the film, as there are ZERO extras -- this release is about as bare-bones as it can get. There's really no excuse for such an oversight, as many of the principals (including the now-adult voice actors) are undoubtedly still alive. An opportunity missed, but still a great movie to own."
5,"""...one of the saddest songs you'll ever hear in your whole life"".","Indeed. My mother, Shelby Flint, sang that saddest song. Decades later just thinking of this tune (""Do You Remember Me"") still has an affect on me. My friends and I even now dare eachother to see this cartoon because it is so heartwrenching -- in large part (I think) due to that song! A much-loved story."
2,Not as good as the TV specials,"Purchased ""Snoopy, Come Home"" along with ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown."" Was hoping these would be more like the TV holiday specials but they are not as funny or entertaining. My 4 yr old loves the Christmas and Halloween specials, and ""Bon Voyage"" but did not take a liking to these. Probably better for older kids."
3,REALLY sad,"I saw this when I was about eight years old and cried buckets of tears, as did my little sister, and over 30 years later I still remember how sad it was. If your kid needs to learn how to deal with sadness and loss, this movie might be appropriate for them. It's not a bad movie, and I'm a strong believer that not every kids movie should be all rainbows and sunshine. But just be warned that some kids may not be able to handle this one depending on their maturity level and temperament."
3,Violent in one short part,We had to get rid of this video - our four year old loved it but there is one short part where Linus and Snoopy hit and kick and hurt each other. Maybe back in the 60's / 70's that seemed okay for young kids to watch - but my four year old started imitating the behavior immediately after the movie. Maybe when she is older she can watch it.There is also a short boxing match between Lucy and Snoopy that seemed merely designed for Snoopy to hurt Lucy - but that one is less troublesome to me.It is a shame - pretty good movie. The crying over Snoopy leaving is a little drawn out - but otherwise it is pretty good. Just not in my house right now!
3,Good Peanuts Fun,"For anyone who truly loves the Peanuts Gang and their pal Snoopy then Snoopy Come Home is for you. It is one more happy chapter in the lives of Schultz's lovable characters.Now, we have to remember the year Snoopy Come Home was released is not up to the grade of most animated movies today, but still worth watching. So, enjoy!"
4,DVD got damage,"I receive the DVD, unfortunately it's damage due to the transportation. I want the complete replacement of it.Thank you for your comprehension.Regards,Alejandro Flores"
3,VHS version quality is poor,"I tried my VHS tape on 3 different players, and all of the bold colors ""bled"" to the left. I don't see this on any of the other Peanuts videos, and I own all of them.The DVD version, on the other hand, looks fantastic."
5,I love this movie to death,This was the bomb movie back in the day when I was a child. I rewound my tape so much that it just snapped. I mean I must've literally watched this movie til the tape ribbon made the screen all static-y. LOL This was the bomb movie and I will love it always. Thank you to whoever created this film. I love the jazz music too. Everything was the bomb in this film.
3,Too Sad and Slow for my Preschooler,"My son is 27 months old and LOVES Snoopy movies. However, this movie is a bit too sad, subdued, and depressing for him. He gets bored after about 20 minutes. Snoopy Come Home is a good movie for nostalgic adults, but for a small child, I'd recommend Snoopy Reunion."
3,Missing A Key Element,"Don't get me wrong, this is a charming story of Snoopy finding his original owner. Kids love it, but what is missing to me is the genius of Vince Guaraldi. The music here is quite dated, unlike Guaraldi's masterpieces. If you don't think music can make a difference, watch this after ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and you'll see what I mean. Otherwise an enjoyable tape which seems a to have a bit of filler to complete the 80 minutes of time. Good for kids and hardcore Peanuts fans."
3,Come Home,Can't say that he has ever talked with me about it. Charlie Brown is a household fixture in our house so this was one to add to our collection.
5,Tearjerking!,"""Snoopy, Come Home"" is the saddest cartoon I've ever seen! Oh sure, ithas some funny parts, like in the editor letter, ""Being a taxpayer..."" But it'susually tearjerking, like the endless ""No Dogs Allowed"" signs, sweet Lilacrying in the hospital window, when Snoopy gets kicked out of the library, the going-away party (I cried!!!) Schroeder's emotional playing of the song ""It's A Long Way To The Tipperary"". Songs include ""Me and You"", ""No Dogs Allowed"", ""I Still Remember"", and the old song ""It's A Long Way To The Tipperary"". Watch this!"
4,Bioballs...,"I had the hardest time finding the size of these bioballs because it doesn't say it anywhere, even on the Marineland website. Turns out they are the small kind, a little over 1cm in diameter and to be used for the Marineland canister filters. They are pretty decent, though I wish they could have molded in a different color plastic because with a light color plastic you can actually see the film of bacteria on them."
2,Too Small,I was disappointed as to how small these bio balls were. They are about the size of a marble. I wouldn't order this again and would purchase larger sized balls next time.
1,A terrible idea!,"If you are looking for a book on selfisness, this is it! As new parents, my wife and I were looking for something like this to get our son to sleep through the night. We made the double mistake of; a, buying this book and b, trying out the ideas in it. After a few nights of staying up, listening to our frightened child cry for his parents (and all of us getting less sleep than before I might add) we tossed out the book and went back to our old sleep patterns. So what if your child doesn't sleep through the night? Do you? Each and every night? Not likely. Everyone is different and what most new parents don't need is to be shamed into thinking this is the best system for them (see pages 77-78) he says 'shame' so many times I lost count! Save your money. Listen to your child and to your heart instead, belive me your can't go wrong that way!"
2,A Pep Talk,"This book is great if you're a first-time parent and all you really need is a little pep talk to help you get your child to bed. However, if you've already figured out the ""common reasons babies cry"" (Is he hungry? Is he damp?) and how to childproof a room, look further. Some good information, ""Babies (over 6 months old) and toddlers are not harmed by crying (if the only reason for crying is they want to be with you)"", is padded with lots of common-sense lists and stories meant to encourage. In all, I found the book thin. The ""program"" is actually only a few pages of the 131-page book."
4,Great Book. Easy to read.,"This book helped me to get my 10 month old to sleep through the night. It's written well, so you don't feel bad about your child not sleeping through the night. I would recommend it for all sleepless parents."
1,DO NOT BUY WHITE SCREEN PROBLEM,We bought 3 of these sony ericsson cell phones in June 2007. 2 of the 3 have white screened. One has been replaced by warranty so far. They send the same phone as a replacement so who knows how long that will last. They were not abused phones only routine handling. When we bought them the ATT salesperson recommended them over another we were looking at. No one mentioned this had been a problem.
2,Sony Ericsson Z520a,I have had the phone for 2 years. I complained to Cingular about all the dropped calls. I have another phone with Cingular that works fine in the same house. Cingular or should I say AT&T said it was not the phone but the area i live in(BULL).
1,Stay away from this phone!,"I am on round 3 of this phone and Cingular (ahem... AT&T) seems to think it's okay to keep sending me a broken one. Phone #1 would just turn off all the time. It didn't matter if the battery was fully charged or not, it would just turn off and cause me to miss all sorts of calls. Phone #2? Same problem. Phone #3? Same problem PLUS it now only displays a white screen and I have to guess when I'm calling people. I'm getting a new phone from Cingular in the next few days... but DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!"
1,Stay away from this phone,All the features are nice but it will drop calls. I am waiting for a chance to get a new phone. :(
2,A troubled product with good features,"I have had this phone for about a year, for better or worse and have had the full experience of the horrible firmware that it has. Random restarts, muted calls, failing rendering of the menus, etc. Don't buy this phone unless your sure or more likely a masochist.Feature wise it a very strong phone, the bluetooth working correctly, syncing, reception, etc. But, killed by buggy software making the phone unusable, just plain bad."
2,Not very good,"I bought this phone in February of this year. . . after pretty typical use, it was non-functional by August."
2,"charger ssinks, poor shell design","I had this phone for about three weeks. I absolutely hated it. The charger that came with it broke on the first use, so I got a $30 charger for it, and that too broke on the first use. I sent it back.I also did not like the shell of this phone. The cover is slightly recessed, and there isn't a good place to grip it to open it. I lost a couple of incoming calls because the cover slipped back down when I tried to open it and thus ended my call before I even answered it. I had to set the phone to answer the calls manually after I opened the shell to prevent me from losing the calls.The screen icons are also very tiny, and not overly intuitive.This was probably my fifth cell phone, and I liked it the least of any phone I've had. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,worst phone ever,I have had alot of cell phones and this is the worst I have ever had.The buttons on the side are in an bad place. I take lots and lots of pictures of my pocket because of them. It turns off by itself. The screen blanks out. It has two of the worst games ever included with it. It is not a user frienldy phone at all. Dont' waste your money on this phone.
1,The worst phones my family and I have ever had,"We originally purchased 4 of these phones. The had problems from the start. There was a silent recall, tons of memory problems and makes the commercial of least drop calls a standing joke in our family.Due to all the problems and warranty returns we have had 12 of the phones now and most likely counting.For all those that put up with such a bad phone from Sony/Cingular it is just that they make it so hard to replace them. We just suffer through the process ... Cingular finally changed out 2 of the Sony z520s with different models ... but two of us still have to suffer.Good luck if you like this phone ... either you are one of the very lucky ones to not get a defective phone (as there are literally thousands of postings from thousands of people on the Sony and Cingular sites) or your expectation of quality is not very high."
1,zero stars really,"Got this phone with a contract in April 2007. By Nov. it white screened. No problem, it was under warranty and att sent a replacement. That one white screened after about 6 weeks. They sent one more telling me they had a ""three strikes"" clause and that if this one broke under warranty, they would send me a different phone altogether. Guess what? The third didn't even last a week before it white screened. They weren't dropped or otherwise abused. They're just lousy phones. ATT sent an LG to replace the third failure."
1,Faulty Model!,THIS IS A FAULTY MODEL! I got this phone last January. By April it completely shut off and refused to turn back on. I got it replaced no big deal. Then it started to randomly shut off and then the screen completely turned white. The phone is completely useless and the warranty expired 2 weeks ago. I have to buy a new phone. When the phone worked it worked great but expect to pay money for a new phone before your contract expires! Stay away from this phone!!!!
1,Worst phone ever,"I got this sony ericsson Z520a phone a year back and already had 3 changes with cingular. It freezes all the time & we had the most dropped calls ever (Cingular sucks). We had previously had two phones with the screen losing half of the pixels with white bars and got exchanged. Even now one of my phones has lost the pixels but Sony won't do anything, their customer service sucks!I agree with all other reviewers that this is the worst phone ever !"
3,sony-ericcson z520a,I only had the phone for a couple of weeks and the screen went black on me. I am returning phone to Amazon for refund but reordered phone again. For the 2-weeks or so that it did work i liked it. It is easy to access the internet & e-mail by following instructions on Sony's website. I really like all the different features i.e.-programming your own music tones. Hopefully will have better sucess with replacement.
2,Decent phone when the screen actually works,This is the second phone i'm returning to Cingular with screen problems. The first phone's screen turned completely white. Second phone has white lines obscuring 1/2 the screen. Cingular rep denies any inherent problems. I hate it when you know companies are FOS and they won't fess up.
1,"Looks nice, just wish it worked well","I'm on my third z520a in the six months I've owned it. The only reason I haven't gone through more is that I've accepted this phone is a lemon. The phone freezes and can't be shut off, requiring removal of the battery to reset, frequently drops calls, doesn't always let me place calls, and just plain does weird things that result in an unreliable and frustrating call experience. What is even more annoying is that I purchased expensive, model-specific accessories that will become useless paperweights when I replace this with a new phone - a phone I will be out additional hundreds on, not to mention the cost of accessories. I'll never buy another Sony Ericsson product."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"I've had this phone for 8 months, and it's been nothing but trouble. People have called me, I've opened up the phone to have found the phone to crash, and when I turn it back on, it doesn't show what was missed. The phone will randomly freeze, forcing you to take out the battery and turning it back on. The final straw was the white screen of death when I tried to access the calculator. The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced."
4,For those who is wondering,"I bought this phone as a Christmas gift for someone, so can't leave any feedback yetOne thing I was trying to learn before ordering, is if this phone is UNBRANDED, but Amazon staff was not at any help.YES this phone is unlocked and unbranded, it does comes with two face covers (blue and gray) with the wall charger and hendsfree earbud."
1,Not a ultra last battery and last about 10 shots,"This is not a ultra last battery, do not really know what brand it is but do not see any identification on the battery indicating it is ultra last. Last about 10 shots on my camera.SF Planet sells it."
2,hmmm...,"as i'm getting ready fot nremt-p, I found this book to be the worst..Hardly any scenerios, but many definitions and some wrong..(Give D50 for DKA?) Hmmm....It will make you think you don't understand what you were sure about before..Stick with the others: learning express,mosby refresher, and mcgraw hill pre-test..Then again I have yet to take the test. God Speed & Good Luck...rog"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I am the author of this book. Whenever you are buying an EMS book, be sure that you are looking at the most current edition. This book is OUT OF DATE."
5,Beautiful - again!,"I have read so many books by Doreen, this second Visions book is just as great as the first! For those who have never had an ""encounter"" or a ""vision"", don't dismay - you first need to believe that one doesn't need to be extraordinary to have angels communicate with them. I should know, I am very ordinary, but very lucky to have an open mind & spirit... Remember - our angels cannot help us unless we ask them to!!!Believe and you shall see!!!! :o} :o}"
5,"Inspiring, Fun, Insightful & Healing!","This is a wonderful collection of true angel stories from people of all walks of life that wiill amaze and mesmerize you. Open up your heart to the Divine as you allow yourself to connect with the angelic realm through reading about angel encounters, and and creating some for yourself as well! Part II of this books includes detailed steps that anyone can take to open up to seeing, hearing, and sensing their own angels and angelic companions. A must-read for all angel lovers, and anyone who is interested in true life spiritual experiences. This book could change your life!"
4,necklace review,the pendant was very nice but the neck length wasn't long enough. but the seller was really good and service was excellent
3,OK,"This is a nicely printed book with attractive sturdy laminated boards. The contents appear serviceable but not outstanding. As apparently inevitable in book of this kind the chapter on ""structure of wood"" has many small (sometimes not so small) inaccuracies, but these refrain from overwhelming the usability of the chapter. The Gallery of Popular Wood also seems serviceableful, but also has its share of errors (especially the 'lacewood' item was pretty terrible, reflecting the confusion of the US woodworker in this respect).For my money the 'Good_Wood_Handbook' by Jackson & Day is the better choice for somebody wanting an allround introductory book on wood, mainly because it has more and better color pictures. However I can see how the indivual woodworker might prefer this because of the friendly style of writing. Maybe it boils down to this: the text-oriented reader should consider this book, while the more visually oriented reader can go straight for the 'Good_Wood_Handbook'."
1,"This author used my name and image, distorted it, and never asked for permission.","This author is a thief. She used one of my images from a poster that includes my name, without permission, and then distorted the image. Shame on her."
2,Ten Years Ago this was Radical,"The problem with this book is that it's a mile wide and one inch deep. Each artist only gets a page or two, and the images are small - so you only get a brief taste. After a while all of the ""radical"" graphics look alike - and not much floats to the surface. You won't find yourself going back to this book for ispiration after you have opened it a few times.There are some good designers represented here, but they get lost in coverage that reminds me of a bad yearbook. Most of the work looks pretty, but very little of it is realy smart. Some of the work shown was really cutting edge stuff back in 1985, but today it looks a little dated. If this book reprented itself as a study of alternative design from '85 to '95 that might be one thing - but it doesn't have enough perspective or go deep enough."
5,Fantastic,My wife cooks a lot and she finds it very good. All the pans and pot are in convenient sizes and are easy to clean and keep. The only down side is the plastic ware is worthless. It behaves like rubber when used to stir soups or stews or when flipping the omelet...
4,satisfied,"I've only used this for a months and there're a couple of scratches on the pan. be aware of that :Dother than that, it's perfect for college students"
5,Farberware Clear Benefits 14-Piece Set Silver,I love my new cookware. My 16 month old grandson does too. He get the cookware and the cooking utencils that came with it and pretends to cook all the time. I like using them and so does he.
4,A great find!,"We love this set. It is nice looking, very light weight, and easy to clean. The only down side is that it is not recommended for cooking on ""high."" This is rarely a big deal, we just have to cover the pot to get it to boiling and plan a bit more time. For the price, it is spectacular and we are very pleased."
4,Private enterprise--a success story!,"I had recently visited Biltmore Estate, and wanted more info about the current owner and developer of the site. This book was recommended by a member of the estate staff, who knows the owner. It answered my questions and I am glad I bought and read it. It is clearly a volume commissioned by the subject, but it appears to be objective and accurate. It is well written. I found it interesting that the estate is still in the hands of the descendants of the Vanderbilt family, and that it is operated as a private, for profit enterprise, with no governmental or not-for-profit foundation support. The enterprise is remarkable, and in spite of ""down"" times that led to despair for the future, it is continually expanding and thriving, and is a major factor in the success of the Asheville area as a tourist destination. The story is one of prudent and pay as you go management, and is one which is worth reviewing and using as a model for other historic sites."
3,Like Going To Biltmore School,Half way through the book it just becomes tedious. There is a fair amount of repetition. I had to purchase another book because this one lacks enough photos. We are planning a trip there in the coming weeksand now I think I know more than I need to know.
5,Just what you need before visiting the Lady,This is one of the most informative and entertaining books! I can hardly wait to see the Lady and all of her treasures in person!
3,First timer,"First time to order a book through Amazon. I had hope for colored photos in the book. However, the thing that bothered me the most was the packaging for mailing. My book corners were bent as the packaging had no padding. I try to take care of my books and this one was already damaged and is not suitable for table placement."
5,Lady on the Hill,"I've read and studied regarding the lives of the Vanderbilt families and the Biltmore inparticular. This is truly one of the BEST books I've read. We've all learned about the house and George Vanderbilt's ideas and thinking on building Biltmore. This book describes the life of his wife Edith and their daughter Cornelia after his death and what they had to go through to keep Biltmore after his death. The research is absolutely amazing. For anyone who is interested or obsessed with The Biltmore, this is a MUST read."
4,Small detail make a huge difference - center expansion,The small expansion pleat in the center was just enough give to fit the gap between the shower wall and tub. I was unable to locate this type shower splash guard at the local hardware stores.
1,Many defective tracks,"I'm not sure what happened when Audubon decided to transfer their five VHS tapes of their videoguide onto DVDs. As has been mentioned in other reviews here, the quality on many of the tracks is inconsistent, and often downright poor. However, more importantly, I have found many tracks to be defective, and after returning this product and receiving a new copy, I found the same defects. On Disc 1, if you try to watch the tracks on the Buteos, or on the Owls, or even the ""introduction"" or ""glossary"" from the main menu, the video is garbled and unwatchable, as if the transfer to DVD had problems but was not corrected. Overall, a potentially exciting but ultimately disappointing video guide."
4,DL's back at it again.,This is another DL banger. I have been a fan of DL since his Going Home special. This guy is funny. He's all over TV doing a lot of big things. Comedy fans should definetly check tihs joint.
3,Nothing different,"This ""Platinum Comedy Series : D.L. Hughley"" is really not that special if you own the original (ASIN : B0000A1HO3). It is the exact same dvd with a new cover. I was hoping for a ""Deluxe edition"" with a bonus cd. That would have made this worth re-getting. This special was halarious."
3,"3 stars compared to other D.L., 4 stars compared to everyone else","While this is the only D.L. Hughley stand-up DVD we've seen, we have enjoyed him in several TV appearances, and also a fantastic live set at a comedy club in the last year.D.L. is a great talent but this is not his best work. He seems to try to force in unnecessary extra profanity, and while there are a number of good jokes, it misses some of the fine-tuning and great wit & insight behind other D.L. comedy. That said, if you have already watched his other stuff, this is certainly still worth checking out. Because on an average day, D.L. matches many comics on their best day!"
4,"American Ido, SEason 4, The Showstoppers","Showstoppers indeed. All of these American Idol hopefuls sound terrific on this album; often a lot better than they did singing the songs live. But, that's okay, it's a fun retrospective of American Idol's best season yet. My favorite, Constantine Maroulis' ""My Funny Valentine"" shows the most originality and showcases his versatility. It's probably the only truly original presentation on the album. However, Nadia Turner's take on ""You Don't Have To Say You Love Me"" really is breathtaking none the less; never did understand why she was knocked off so quickly. The group song, ""When You Tell Me That You Love Me"" is a nice song, but Vonzell Solomon is a bit too overpowering; a little squeaky. What happened to Bo Bice there anyway?"
3,Better than I thought it would be,"This is a good CD. Much better than I anticipated. I hoped/expected Bo and Carrie to have good songs, but was pleasantly surprised by the recording quality and singing quality of several others. The order of songs is interesting - is a good reflection of how the order of artists should have been selected on the show. Carrie, Bo, Vonzell, Anwar, and Nadia's songs are great - couple others are good (Nikko, Jessica Sierra), but it's down hill from there. But definitely worth the $$ if you enjoyed the show. (Note that the recording quality of Bo's is a bit weak compared to some of the others.)"
3,Delightfully Idol,"This CD is pretty much what you would expect. A few great songs, a few songs that send you in a frenzy to find ear plugs, a few songs that sound so close to the original that they're not...original, and a few good tracks that are ruined by cheesy instrumental backing.Let me give you my quick break down:The truely Showstopping tracks were sung by Anwar's ""A House is Not a Home"", Nadia's ""You Don't Have To..."", Jessica Sierra's ""Total Eclipse"", and Carrie's ""Independence Day"".Vonzell, Scott, and Nikko all sang well on their tracks but they weren't anything too specialBo's track was very dissappointing. He's been placed with Costantine and Mikalah in the category of: I only cringed a few times while listening to these songs.Anthony and Lindsey's tracks are not terrible, but they're less than desirable.Finally, I was quite impressed by the group track at the end, though it was a bit cheesy."
5,Best Idol CD Yet,"Um, this whole album is good but here is a score for each individual performance:1. Carrie Underwood ""Independence Day"" - 4/52. Bo Bice ""I Don't Wanna Be"" - 3/53. Vonzell Solomon ""Best of My Love"" - 5/54. Anwar Robinson ""A House Is Not A Home"" - 3/55. Nadia Turner ""You Don't Have To Say You Love Me"" - 4.5/56. Nikko Smith ""Part Time Lover"" - 5/57. Constantine Maroulis ""My Funny Valentine"" - 4/58. Anthony Fedorov ""Everytime You Go Away"" - 3/59. Jessica Sierra ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" - 4.5/510. Scott Savol ""Against All Odds"" - 4/511. Mikalah Gordon ""God Bless The Child"" - 5/512. Lindsey Cardinale ""Knock On Wood"" - 2/5"
4,American Idols Can Sing!,"A must have for the fan that follows American Idol. Popular favorite Idols perform the songs you saw them do on stage. Good music, you wouldn't know these were amateurs."
4,Best season! Good album!,"I would say American Idol 4 is the best among all seasons! All 12 contestants are real good singers with huge potential, especially Carrie, Bo, Vonzell, Constantine, Anwar, Nadia and Jessica - they are the standouts.My top favourites are Independence Day and Best of My Love. Carrie and Vonzell did a reall great job in their own song. I like Anwar's A House is Not a Home and Nadia's You Don't Have to Say You Love Me too. Linsey's Knock on Wood is quite good. The rest are all cool.Great voices, perfect performances, awesome album. Definitely worth to buy!"
1,Seek and destroy.,"Hoo boy. If there's one thing The Curmudgeon hates, it's reality television. And if there's one thing The Curmudgeon REALLY hates, it's these insipid talent shows.Honestly, who looks at this record and thinks, ""I MUST own this""? I just don't get it. Oh, wait - I know who buys it - The Scum. That's what this easy listening, non-challenging garbage is aimed at - The Scum. The morons who love everything that's popular, will buy anything that they don't have to think about, adore everything that's put into their stupid empty heads.This isn't aimed at this particular ""album"", more the whole pop-idol/american idol/you'reanidiot idol thing. It's wretched, it's cheap TV and it's clogging MTV etc with sub-standard mawkish rubbish. And if YOU bought it, it's YOUR fault, and you can go to Hell.The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk"
2,Just Bo!,"I liked Bo, Carrie, and Lindsey Cardinelli as favorites. Great song choice of Bo's - ""I Don't Wanna Be"" to do and put on this album. Everything else is deeply un-CD worthy. Well, no matter what Carrie sings it's amazing, but I didn't like any of her song choices (she should have went with a Leann Rimes song!) so I'm biased there. Congrats to her on winning though and hope for a crossover album so she doesn't just disappear. Every other song on here is old and terrible. Singers take old songs and make great covers all the time, but there was none of that here. I would have picked a different Vonzell song, and Lindsey Cardinelli did an AMAZING job with the Aerosmith song. Who picked these selections?? Don't buy this unless you didn't record Bo's song this season. Better than Gavin Degraw 200%!"
3,Colourful Genre,I am a big fan of most of the American Idol 4 finalist!!!! and i think it is a good cd but prefer live version more..overall i like the Ensemble 'When You Tell Me That You Love Me'... but i just cant hear mikalah gordon voice.next would be Vonzell rendition of 'Best Of My Love'. More relax then the spectaculars
3,"3 3/4 stars, actually","By Far the best-sounding group song from any season, When You Tell Me That You Love Me, is enough reason for me to give this album a good review. You also have Carrie Underwood in her element, and the 2 runners-up Bo Bice and Vonzell Solomon are very good as well. Nadia, Jessica and Scott are also good. I really wish that they would have done away with Mikalah and Lindsey, but oh well. Not too terrible. :)"
4,Idol 4 Showstoppers,"Enjoyed this album immensely especially the outstanding vibrant Constantine's performance of My Funny Valentine, Jessica Siera's Total Eclipse of the Heart and Nadia Turner's You Don't Have To Say You Love Me and of course Bo Bice's I Don't Want To Be."
3,Showstoppers Mix Up,"The music on this CD was good. When I first listened to this once I got to tracks 4,5,6,7,8 the songs were not in the same order as listed on the CD case."
3,SHOWSTOPPERS??? not all of them,"I am a huge american idol fan and i have every single cd that came out for the show. honestly this is the better album from the shows cast hands down but they did not look into the show in a hole....songs they should have done:vonzell: ""i have nothing""carrie: ""macarthur park""constatine: ""bohemian rhapsody""nikko: ""incomplete"" or ""can we talk""anwar: ""what a beautiful world""my favourtie track on the album is nadia turner ""u dont have to say you love me""... BRILLIANT!!!anthony jessica and lindsay should have not been on the show....mikaylah and scott surprisingly did good.overall this is the best cd from all the seasons but this is not the best talent (season 2 was the best)3.7 stars out of 5"
3,Average CD......nothing spectacular,"IMO, it seems the producers were in a hurry to get out the cd. It must of been completed somewhere early in the season. Because the best performances of the top 6 were not on this cd. As many have said....Carrie should have sung Alone. Bo...Whipping Post. Constantine....Bo Rap, I think I love you, or my fave......You make me so very happy.This cd seems to be geared towards the syrupy sweet crowd. I can't tell if they were going for the teens or the Grandmothers with this one. For those of us in the middle....I found it very lacking musically and production wise."
1,Conspiracy theory?,"Hmmmmph. Just an astronomically impossible coincidence that the last three AI compilation CDs have featured the final three contestants in the EXACT order of finish? Check it out, the CD has to be produced about one month before it's release date and yet -- amazingly -- the winner, runnerup and third-place finisher have the 1, 2 and 3 cuts (Carrie, Bo, Vonzell).I enjoy the show and I wish each of these young artists great success in their musical pursuits....but it's quite possible that the ""voting"" public is being duped big-time by this organization.I review...YOU decide! ;-)"
4,A great cd!,my rankings on each track:1. Independence Day - Carrie Underwood 8/102. I Don't Want to Be - Bo Bice 6/103. Best of My Love - Vonzell Solomon 9/104. House Is Not a Home - Anwar Robinson 5/105. You Don't Have to Say You Love Me - Nadia Turner 9/106. Part-Time Lover - Nikko Smith 6/107. My Funny Valentine - Constantine Maroulis 7/108. Total Eclipse of the Heart - Jessica Sierra 8/109. Everytime You Go Away - Anthony Fedorov 7/1010. Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now) 6/1011. Knock on Wood - Lindsey Cardinale 10/1012. God Bless the Child - Mikalah Gordon 7/1013. When You Tell Me That You Love Me 1/10 - for the sheer fact that the song is clearly biased and should have been redone for this cd with every person getting equal parts
2,May not be a fair review,"I may have under-rated this. I bought it along with Bo Bice's Dual Disc, ""The Real Thing"". The video component of the dual disc added so much to it, it made the CD only format seem boring and obsolete. So, this suffered in comparison.The only CD player I own is in my car and watching a video while driving would not be wise, so I guess we know where this will wind up! I have a feeling my refusal to give in to CD technology may prove to have been a financially wise choice. I predict audio only CDs may very well prove to have been a ""flash in the pan"". Too bad I had a house fire which wiped out my music collection of casettes and old vinyl LPs. But, I suppose, if I had had CDs, they would have melted down as well."
3,Big mistake,"Anthony's real showstoper was ""I Surrender"". It was by far the best performance by anyone on this show. This only one that gave me goose bumps. Unfortunately, it's not on this album. Big mistake. Maybe they couldn't get the rights to put it on the album. I hope Anthony gets to release it some day."
2,Carrie and Bo fizzled,"Carrie Underwood and Bo Brice picked songs that were wrong for the CD....I was very disappointed and ""Bless the Child"".....terrible...sorry"
1,American Stinker,"Do not buy this CD!!!! As a big fan of American Idol and of a lot of the people represented on this CD, I have to say that this is the worst production ever. The CD sounds like it was recorded in a public bathroom. The levels are way off and the song selection is weak at best. And to add insult to injury the back cover line-up doesn't match the song order on the CD. A true rush for $$$ and a disappointment to fans. I wish I could give negative stars."
3,not that great,i hate 1 song only that is vonzell make it 2 nadia they cant sing im happy that carrie underwood won
4,a good cd,"My favorites are Jessica Sierra, Nikko Smith, Vonzell Solomon, and Carrie Underwood. They were really good on this CD. The good ones are Anthony Federov, Bo Bice, Constantine Maroulis, Lindsay Cardinale, and Anwar Robinson. They were good but not great on this CD. The ones who weren`t so good were Scott Savol, Nadia Turner, and Mikaylah Gordan. They were bad on this CD. Overall this is one of my favorite Idol CDs."
3,Interestingly Good!,"When I first started this book I was little confused. But, as I went along in the book found it to be very good. However, I felt that the book was a tad to slow. It would have been better if I had found out the reason that Natalie wanted the divorce sooner. That probably would have made my opinion of the book better."
1,BORING,I love all harlequines... but Marriage on the Edge was horribly horribly slow and boring... I didnt even make it to the 3rd chapter.
4,Great Buy,This plant stand is very attractive and versatile. The marble is beautiful and will compliment most areas of our home.
4,Attractive plant stand,"This is an attractive plant stand I bought for my living room, and I'm generally pleased with the purchase. The stand was easy to assemble and is attractive--I'm especially pleased with how the marble matches the wood finish, which is difficult to tell from the product photo. One concern: the marble top arrived with a substantial scratch (about 2 inches long) on the top surface, which would be an annoyance if I were using the product as a table rather than a plant stand."
3,A bit filmsy,The green marble top looks great. However the wood stands give it away and loos cheap but Good value for money.
3,Ordered two square topped and got one square and one round,"I ordered 2 square topped tables and received one square topped and one round. Each one looks very nice, but I wanted them to match. For the price, it's not worth shipping them back, so I'm just going to live with it, and if anyone asks, I'll just say I meant to be arty or something."
1,"Wrong item, wrong color, horrible packaging.","First off, I ordered a green marble square top table and received a white marble round top table. I'd return it if it wasn't such a problem to return it in original packaging. The packaging was HORRIBLE. It is taped so extensively and evidently ships to Amazon from the manufacturer with corner protection packaging that is then taped over all the potential ways to open the box itself. It was extremely difficult to get it out of the shipping packaging to merely open the box! To give you an idea, with a box cutter, it took longer to get the box open (because of the amount of taping all over it) than it did to assemble the darn thing. And again, it was the WRONG TABLE. Buyer beware. You may not get what you ordered and you'll spend quite a while finding out it's wrong."
3,dimension issue..,"this review is kind of late.. i ordered this product back Dec.2009 for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loved it, however i did not.. in October for this birthday i purchased a Baltimore Ravens helmet and display case, and we need something to display everything on.. but the display case and helmet is bigger then the stand table... the only thing i like about it is the color of the wood,.. i wouldn't have purchased this item if the dimensions were given b4 i completed my order...-Nichole"
3,iffy but just what I wanted,"This thing is manufactured cheaply, the threaded holes don't line up with each other, leaving the legs crooked. But I figured this was the case before I purchased it. It definitely is not the most stable thing in the world, but I don't have very much weight on it. Overall I expected it to be on the cheap side, before I bought it, so no surprise. But it looks pretty good, and performs how I expected. It's a case of get what you pay for."
3,It's OK,"It's OK. It has about the same amount of material as the ""iMovie 2 for Macintosh Visual Quickstart Guide"" - The missing manual is fatter because it contains additional stories and things that a reader might find amusing, but that are not particular relevant to the topic. The section on movie making basics is very good. For an expanded view see ""The Five C's of Cinematography"". I thought I would find more information in this book since it is fatter than in the VQG, but it ended up that they are about even in content."
5,Simple Simon,"Can it get any simpler !! ha ha ha ha haI found this book to be extremely informative and easy to understand (especially since i am yet to purchace a mac and digital video cammera ).. I will have no hesitation now to go out and purchase a Mac and a Digital cammera .. and feel confident making my first feature film or ""Home Movie "" LOL"
2,Average Book,This book doesn't supply the results of its tests. If you want the results you still need to subscribe to consumerslab.com. I suggest skipping this book and just subscribe to www.consumerslab.com.
1,conslabs rating supplements,"This book provides basic knowledge @ vitamins & herbs, but not very helpful with comparing brands of supplements and potency values."
2,still looking,This book did not give a description of all supplaments I was looking for. The buying guide was good but I wanted a complete vitamin supplament listing
1,Minimum usefull information,"Was disappointing, mainly because it does not do any good comparisons but directs you to the website. Basically this is tool to market the consumer dot com website and get twenty nine dollars for a year subscription."
4,Fabluous with one flaw,"This movie, although dated, is incredible. Real stories from real people living with HIV. The director/narrator does a great job of weaving the stories together. The people are believable and their stories are compelling. The only flaw to this is that it is not closed captioned for the hearing impaired, which was the only reason I wasn't able to use this in my class on HIV/AIDS at Gallaudet University."
1,Cheap Cooler,"It looks cheap. It feels cheap. It is made cheap. All that said, you can make it work for you if you are really into dressing up your case and it fits your theme. No noticable temp differences on the RAM while this thing is plugged in and running. Performance wise, don't expect much from this thing."
1,NOT an Air Gap Faucet!!!!,"We received the faucet a few days ago, and upon opening, we realize it's NOT an air gap faucet, which is absolutely needed and in the description of the product. Once realizing this, we also find that we can not return the item because we opened the package. Needless to say we are out the $ for the faucet, and now have to find another faucet and get rid of this brand new one some how. If you need an air gap faucet (which has 3 connections on the bottom for RO systems) this is NOT what you need!"
4,Great Raspberry Rose Cake Recipe Came With It!,"My pan came with a recipe for raspberry jam rose cakes. I've made them many times and they are always a big hit. Look fantastic and taste great.To prep the pan, I spray with non-stick spray and then dust thoroughly with flour. When I do this, the cakes pop out nicely after baking. But I have to use a lot of grease and a lot of flour. And not overfill the wells.Then you have to clean the little crevices, and you can't use abrasives. My favorite method of clean-up is to fill each well with hot soapy water and let soak overnight.Overall, a quality pan. Heavy and sturdy, there certainly isn't going to be any warping or rusting. Because of the non-stick coating, you shouldn't heat the pan over 500 degrees, as you risk releasing toxic fumes from the nonstick coating. Fortunately, you bake the little rose cakes at a lower temperature.This has been a hit for me!"
4,Excellent for baking,"I own the same brand in heart-shaped form, and I've been very pleased with the product. The muffins always turn out so well and unsticking them from the pan is effortless (which is more than I can say about several other brand tins out there). After baking with this pan I realize how nice it is not to be concerned with effectively removing the baked good and knowing that the product will look beautiful is also great.The only downsides are the cost, heaviness, and the fact they're not very space-efficient-- only two of these can fit in a conventional oven and one better use both hands to remove the pan. Though $30 is a lot of money for something that bakes so few goods, it is well worth it based on its reliability and durability. As a person who baked 3 times a week, I got my money's worth."
4,Breathing life into the land,"TABLE OF CONTENTS sounds like a work-in-progress title that ended up too accurate to discard. Here is one man's net cast wide, and John McPhee brings his peculiarly illuminative style to bear on bears and dams, family practice and a basketball player shooting for re-election to the Senate. Using succinct particulars to demonstrate the general, the author lives with his subjects and breathes their life into his writing. If you appreciated his style in ENCOUNTERS WITH THE ARCHDRUID (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1977), BASIN AND RANGE (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1982), COMING INTO THE COUNTRY (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1991) or THE CURVE OF BINDING ENERGY (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1994), to mention just a few of his dozens of books, you know what to expect. Essay is my favorite form of literature and McPhee is a master."
3,Light Up Stunt Top,"All 3 of my Grand Children love the spinning especially when we turn the colorful lights on the top. Win lit and spinning, the top shows many different lit designs."
5,POWERFUL,"The 3/8 impact I bought was the same brand and looks similar to this one. My work bought it for me because I am a diesel mechanic and I rebuild cat engines. When I recieved it the box says 675 ft lbs reverse torque. I thought that sounded a little unreal to me with it being a 3/8 drive. But when I started using it, the power was the only thing that was unreal. I bought me a IR 1/2 impact to remove the head bolts from this engine as they are on very tight. I bet my co worker 20 bucks that the 3/8 FP impact could remove them. He said there is no way because the IR struggles to remove them. When I zipped ten in a row out right before his eyes he nor I could believe it. I don't believe it has 675 ft lbs of torque but it is stronger than a lot of 1/2 drive impacts. FP made a believer out of me."
2,Fragile,"All Breyer products are way overpriced. After I put this together it would fall apart if you barely touched it. Finally I got out the Superglue, which helped 100%. Don't expect to use the real water feature very much because it is a huge mess. However my 6 year old daughter really likes it."
1,don't waste your money!,"Very dissapointed... would rate 0 stars if I could. de-mount tool is pretty much useless. Mount iron works ok for mounting and demounting. Have used these irons on 11r-22.5, 255-70-22.5, and 385-65-22.5 size tires. Best I can figure these tools will only work under ideal conditions, i.e. clean wheels and tires, that are well lubed, and soft from age. Don't let the ads and the videos online fool you. Not the miracle tool they make them out to be. Definitetly not worth the $170."
2,wrong product - Excellent Customer Service!,"I needed a new battery for my UPS and came to Amazon first. I looked up the replacement battery, liked the price and placed my order. When the product arrived, it was NOT the correct battery. I went back and verified that their catalog listed the number I had ordered for my UPS. Indeed, their listing showed what I had ordered and received. I went to the UPS manufacturer's site and found a different number.When I called the this vendor, their customer service was very receptive to my complaint. They verified that their listing showed the battery that I had ordered and since it was their listing that was wrong, they gladly credited my Amazon card. They said it could take 2-3 working days for the credit to appear but it was there the next day.A HUGE THANK YOU!Replacement Battery Cartridge for RBC46"
5,More efficient than replacing the whole UPS,"The battery arrived when expected and in good condition. It slipped right into place and works fine. It cost less and produced less waste than replacing the whole UPS. The runtime on the old battery had dropped to almost nothing. With this battery, it is back to several minutes - enough time to get my PC safely shut down. I have been happily using APC UPS's almost exclusively at home and in my work in IT for many years."
4,Great lamp but limited flexibility,"It's a great lamp and the dimmer switch is fantastic. It's easy to maneuver in the directions it's designed to, but you can't rotate the stem on the base which would be very helpful. Other than this minor difficulty the lamp is great."
4,Too tall and had to send it back for credit,"This lamp was amazing, but it was much to tall for my use. The lamp was flawless and arrived in great condition. The instruction and pre-printed labels made it extremely easy to send back. I just had to hand it over to the UPS driver."
3,"Looks Great, Tastes Okay.","The package of Polenta really looks good. LOTS of Cilantro and other herbs. However, the cooked product comes out somewhat bland and flat. For some reson the Cilantro & Hot Peppers flavor just doesn't come through. Not a bad product, just not very flavorful. I was disappointed!"
4,Really fun recipes that work!,"I have several Nordicware bundt or cake pans which I enjoy because I like to make fancy cakes but am not a confident cake decorator with icing. This book has some really fun recipes for making fancy baked or molded foods that go beyond sweet desserts (although there are recipes for those too). I LOVED the recipe for a baked full round of Brie in pastry, made in the sunflower-shaped pan, and it worked well the first time. Delicious and very pretty!"
5,"Yes, Top Notch","This book is unlike any other. It represents the accumulated wisdom and understanding of two sensitive and intelligent psychiatrists who were in the position of teaching often skeptical Johns Hopkins medical students. These students are among the smartest and able individuals in the country - most of them were not going into psychiatry and had a variable amount of interest and respect for it. The authors were therefore in the position of presenting their chosen field to a challenging audience.This book represents their masterful response. Four separate perspectives are presented, Disease, Dimension, Behavior and Narrative.The combination of creativity and intellectual integrity make it a delightful and worthwhile experience for anyone in psychiatry. The persuasive power of it's ideas make it an essential book for anyone who teaches intelligent medical students or even residents and psychologists in training."
1,Cheap copy,I agree with the other one star review. Sadly I did not take note of it before I ordered. This is a $9.99 disappointment. Not having illustrations makes this book useless.
5,one of the best in spanish music,"Well, I think Invasores is one of the best musical groups that represent our Mexican or should I say Norteno style. I really like their music and hope for them to continue with their success through out the years."
3,A stupid movie,"This really was a poor movie. The story was weak, the acting poor, and the realism, well it was very unrealistic. Case in point, getting shot in the shoulder with a high-powered rifle and then packing around a 20lb or 30lb backpack the very next day with no medical attention, painkillers, etc. Stuff like that.So why 3 stars? Well, because Billy Zane was just so enjoyable in this. Very deadpan, very relaxed and acting like he was just having fun being in a direct-to-dvd movie. ""Listen to your friend Billy Zane, he's a cool dude!"""
2,uh' oh...I smell Cheese!!!,"good movie. but low budget. should have been better. good plot. but tried to imitate tears of the sun but fell way short. love scene was unnessary. wait for movie to come out on FX or Spike Tv..imagine someone trying to imitate the soul singer James Brown on a youtube type program, and you will get what this movie reminds me of..... overall a good opportunity for a first time actor who may be trying to build their resume for future work. but thats' all..."
3,"A good movie, but........","Sniper Reload was a good movie, but I think it should have had more action and less drama to it."
1,this movie is poor.,"I love the first sniper movie it was great. This sniper reloaded wasn't. There are a bunch of stupid scenes and the story line is awful. Example: a scene where the star character Sgt. Beckett shoots the radiator of a jeep that causes it to loose control and wreak,what? Also the beginning of the movie where Sgt Beckett urges his team to stay out of the line of sniper fire but half the movie he's running straight out into the open. Billy Zane has no significant roll. This movie was more like a TV movie on the USA network. Weak, please stop making sniper sequels they suck. Don't bother with this one."
2,Boring,The intense of the Master is not in the showing. It was a very poor attempt and it did come close the original cast.
3,"Intereresting case studies, but weak in theory","The book is filled with interesting examples of training programs around the world; however, the strategies overlap and are lacking in solid theory and substance."
4,Solid,"Josh Rouse continues to improve with each release. This one doesn't immediately grab you like 1972 did. It takes several listens before its treasures are revealed. Josh sings more forcefully here than in the past. Very concise with only 10 songs.This release runs out of gas a little on side two. I find myself skipping over the characterless ""My Love Has Gone"" and ""Life."" ""Why Won't You Tell Me What"" (itself a good song with a good performance) sounds a little out of place.Rouse's brand of adult guitar pop is very appealing, if a little on the bland side at times. See him live if you get a chance. As good as his CDs sound you won't believe how great he and his band sound in person."
4,Brilliant,I've never felt compelled to participate in the Amazon review process until now (for music). This is a brilliant record through and through.
1,Are you kidding?,Are you kidding? I have sent both the seller and Amazon notice that I never received this product. My credit card was charged a month ago with over a three week shipping window to send a cd from NY to Ohio. I'd like to know when Amazon is going to refund my money for this item sold on your web site rather than asking me for my review.
4,Excellent Album,"I received this album from my roomate because we always exchange new music with each other. With the first listen starting with ""its the nighttime,"", which is my favorite track, i knew the album was amazing. Rouse has a very smooth voice that goes very well with his acoustic guitar backing. The instrumentation fills out the songs very well which creates a very cohesive album. He gives us some slow ones and more upbeat which gives the listener a nice blend. I definitely recommend this album to everyone!"
5,this is a fast paced wonderful book,I have loved this book. To me Pam Blackwell has covered all the main areas of prophecy that I have read. I enjoyed the Charaters and the things Pam Blackwell had happen to them. I have read this book at least 50 times. It is great
1,not so great,This book needs and editor. It is very poorly written. It took a lot to force myself to finish this book. Spend you time reading smething more uplifting.
1,Belt Melts,This belt is unable to withstand the five day a week regiment that's recommended in its manual. I've used it for a month as recommended and it shut down on me. The only thing that I'm able to generate is an Error display when the unit is activated.
1,Slendertone Men's Belt,"This was supposed to be for a man and I seriously doubt a very petite woman cold wear this belt. I have complained to the seller with No response, nor do I expect one! Slendertone Men's Belt"
2,Real Dissapointment,"I was so excited to get this set, and I also purchased the thigh and bottom shorts. Both were such a dissapointment. I used each one daily, sometimes twice a day, and it did absolutely nothing as far as toning, however, I did feel quite energized afterwards. The shorts we also very difficult to put on and remove. I was surprisingly pleased with how long the stick on gel pads lasted though."
1,They only want your money,"I really don't have much to comment on the product, it seemed not to do anything for me. What I can comment on is their returns and customer service though. Since it didn't work for me I sent it back honoring the time limit Now after 4 months they are charging my credit card stating I didn't return the product They argue with me at customer service and go around in circles concerning this issue and forget about calling the service center where you send it back to they never return calls. Currently they are disputing it with my credit card and continue to charge me again each time it is reversed. I may never see my money back from them but hopefully I can warn someone who is considering ordering this."
3,It does work to a degree.........,"I have had the flex belt for about three months and used it continuiously for about 6 weeks, then it seems the pads wore out as I was getting a shock on one side of my body and the unit stopped working properly. I could feel some results after about a month but as soon as you stop using it, it's back to what you were before. I feel that the pads wear out too quickly. It's expensive to replace them and they are not that easy to find. I guess i was looking for a quick fix to get rid of that baby belly, but just like exercise, this takes commitment, both time and money."
1,worse customer service,"After using the product for a few times, it stopped working. I wrote to the customer service but got a evasive answer and was unable to get a replacement although it was almost new and had just been bought a few months before"
4,fun and nostalgic tv movie,"I remember catching this movie on tv back in 1981 but it was titled ""stranger at jefferson high"". It stars Stewart Peterson of ""Seven Alone"" and ""Where the red fern grows"" fame. He has grown up to be a very handsome and dependable actor here. Story revolves around Peterson and his rural family who move to the big city and have problems fitting in. Nothing new here, but the likability of Peterson helps the film immensely. I was shocked and quite happy when I saw that this was available to purchase. The relationships between Peterson and his sister, his new nerdy friend, his love interest and the school bullies are all played out very well, thanks to Peterson. ( according to IMDB, this was his last acting role, which is a shame. Whatever happened to him?) The fashions, music and style of the film are very dated but nostalgic and fun to watch again."
2,INADEQUATE,"ALL IN ALL, I FOUND THE BOOK TO BE AN EXTREME SHORTCOMING FORA FINANCIAL GUIDELINE. THE INFORMATION GIVEN WAS LACKING ANY REAL SUBSTANCE BEHIND IT. IT WAS STRAIGHT FORWARD, BUT THERE WASN'T NEAR ENOUGH INFORMATION. I WOULD SUGGEST A BOOK WITH MORE TO IT."
4,Agatha Christie,"I really enjoy Agatha Christie, so this was a good video for me. I like British mysteries, because they usually are more centered on clues and solving the crime and are not so bloody/gory."
4,Miss Marple ... Is on the Case ...,"This was a really good Season only Season 4 surpassed in my mind ... due to Benedict Cumberbatch being in Murder is Easy ... now, that is ""eye candy"" you can devour!"
3,They took too many liberties with this adaptation...,"As a big fan of Agatha Christie, it saddens me how much these series take liberties in adapting the novels. I just read this book. Miss Marple isn't even in it. The story has been so watered down. It's really a shame, because I would hate for someone to see this movie and then think they know the story ""Secret of Chimneys"" by Agatha Christie. The novel is far richer, the characters are wonderful, the writing superb, the storyline far deeper. This is a good enterntaing film, well made, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it, but don't think for a minute that it's an accurate rendition of the ""Secret of Chimneys"". It's barely a shadow of it."
1,Why call it Christie when it's not?,"What a disappointment! If the producers of this series want to write their own stories and have a different type of detective, why not just do so? Trading on the Christie name and the Miss Marple character is really a cheap trick. Please don't call it Christie when it's NOT."
1,REFUND REQUIRED!!!,"it did not play at all, it must have been a faulty blu ray disc, and l went out to buy a brand new blu ray player that plays all regions, and even then it did not work. l want to send it back but threw out the address taking it for granted that it will be in working order. Not happy with the supplier at all and would love to be refunded so amazon if you receive this please refund my credit card. l have never had any other problems with any dvds that l have bought from amazon, but now l am looking for a refund. UNHAPPY CUSTOMER!!"
3,"The forgotten war, easily forgotten","I watched this documentary with high hopes. While the information was good, it was a fairly bland documentary. There was a lot of old war footage and some cheesy music to go along with that. The narration was alright too. There really just wasn't anything about this documentary that excited me. It was looked like the documentary was made at least 10-15 years ago, so that didn't help it out either.I give it a thumbs up for having decent and accurate information, but a thumbs down for watchability."
5,A Very Good Overview,"It is a very-good chronologic narration of the entire war. It also does a good job relating the war to ongoing political issues. If you want to know what was all about, this is it. In the down side, the footage is of poor quality, especially in the first chapter."
3,"Roma, Eau De Toilette","I love ""Roma"" by Laura Biagiotti! Based on my previous experience (use), I found out that for some reason this specific bottle of fragance was not the same. It seems that it was very old, since the fragance was not as strong and genuine as it is suppossed to be. I like the ""brand"", but..."
1,Tastes Awful,"These vitamins were recommended to me by a physician for their nutritional value but, they smell & taste horrible. -- The ""Cherry"" flavor in these vitamins is not nearly enough to cover the overwhelming ""vitamin-y"" smell/taste. -- I wound up purchasing Centrum Kids Dora the Explorer vitamins because my children (3 & 6) like the taste. I hated to do it because the first ingredient listed is sucrose (sugar) and I do my best to be as health concious & all natural/organic for my boys as I can, but -- the vitamins won't do any good if your children won't eat them."
4,"Great political theory, too much pulp fiction","The story of the war is great, it makes perfect sense, and you can really get caught up in it; but I found myself getting impatient as the book got more and more away from the politics, and more into the standard crime fiction. Things pick up at the very end, but I think it could have been even better if he carried the Bush-Baker plotline even further."
4,"Interesting, but a bit slow","There are times when this novel is just bulging with fascinating concepts and I just can't put it down. Then there are times when I spend days trudging through a few pages because I don't want to read more than 2 at a time. Its worth buying and reading, but I didn't find anything truly earth shattering."
1,"Two books in one - one good, the other VERY bad","I liked the plot but disliked the horrible pulp PI story, with big breasted girls and macho guy. Despite what the author affirms, Joe is a RAMBO character. The conspiration plot was wonderfull, and I'm starting to think that the movie Wag the Dog took the best part of the book"
2,"Okay, I guess.","I enjoyed reading this story but I was not drawn in to, really. The thoughts and ideas seemed to scatted in many chapters.Still, a good read, one that will make you think."
4,Good book that leaves you wanting more,"A wonderful look at the electronic marvels we have around the house, along with past playthings long ago left in the dust by ever advancing technologies. My only complaint is that this book barely scratches the surface of what could have / should have been included. Speaking for myself, I would have gladly paid a lot more money to get a book that gave me more to see. As it is, an hour after opening the book, you are done, wishing for more."
4,even a weaker effort from Burgess is a fun read,"'The Pianoplayers' is a decidedly offbeat novel, which comes as no surprise since it was written by the sometimes brilliant yet always offbeat Anthony Burgess. It is a hodgepodge of a story about a woman recounting her life with her piano playing father and how music and sex are somehow interwoven. While the main premise is a load a rubbish the author never fails to entertain with some very clever and often humorous dialog. The book is also rather poorly structured; I got the sense the author sort of mashed together multiple stories and then sewn them into one book. With better editing this book could have been a classic.Bottom line: sometimes it is good to read something enjoyable yet silly."
3,Samsund cd-r,"So I guess these CDs are alright. They seem to burn just fine, to get the truly important thing out of the way. I am not usually one to complain about the way things look, but these CDs are UGLY! I bought them online, with no idea what they would look like. They were name-brand, so I figured, why not? Why do the companies do this? There are two, fairly creepy-looking teenagers with headphones on taking up most of the front of ALL the CDs. There is hardly any place to write on them! Forget these discs if you have light-scribe!Okay, so bottom line: They seem to work so far. That really is the important thing. HOWEVER, there is no place to write on them and you have to look at two HUGE random teenagers every time you pick up a CD. I want room to write. And truthfully, I am a little embarrassed to give these out to people."
2,A bold attempt at snuggling up to big business...,Which ultamitely works no doubt very profitably for the author. One can only hope he's used his money to buy land on high ground.
5,Foot Nectar,"The champagne of soaks, no wonder this stuff is still around, nothing can compare to how GREAT your tootsies feel after the J.F.S. TREAT-ment!"
1,Insipid parody.,"The author tries to give us a picture of life in England before World War I through the tribulations in a nobleman's marriage. The main themes are religious fanaticism, conformism, hypocrisy and the Salvation Army. The pinnacle of indecency is a nobleman who becomes a boxer.This book has not the same quality as 'We'. It lacks biting humour and is far too slow.For a cruel and devastating picture of the same period I recommend 'Winter notes on Summer Impressions' by Fyodor Dostoyevsky."
3,I Don't Get It,"How can this be truly complete & be called ""the very best of.."", with the glaring omission of ""It's a Heartache""??Apparently, the original version she did is nowhere on any compilation I've found here & the crappy, unnecessarily beefed up version she remade in 2005 is lousy."
2,way to small!,"Planned in this being small, but, WOW... this kit is super tiny. The Pleasure Balm was sealed crooked and leaking. The best products in this kit are the Sweet Almond massage oil (I bought this before and loved it!) and the Honey Dust powder (scent is heavenly!) Oil of Love had a faint, almost undetectable scent. My advice is to purchase the full size Sweet Almond oil and Honey Dust. By far, the best products in this kit!!"
3,"Love the items, but No bigger than a deck of cards","The kit is super small. People aren't kidding, it is the size of a deck of cards. The little containiers of oil,etc. are about the size of a quarter. But, I will say, if you need a small, descrete little kit of fun for a night away, then this is it."
3,Super Small,"I love the Kama Sutra products. If you are looking for a super small kit (The palm of your hand.) This would be for you. This picture dose not show how small this Weekend kit really is. Again, I love there products."
4,Nice compactor,"I got this compactor because I was tired of spending $60 a day on rental and two trips to town every time I needed one. The honda engine seems to live up to their reputation, it starts easily every time. The quality of this compactor is good, but not as good as a Bomag Wacker, but then again the price on this is only a little more than half of what a Wacker costs. Over all I am very satisfied with this compactor for my use, and will last me many, many years. I do not think that this compactor would hold up to everyday commercial usage for very long.An excellent addition to any small plate compactor is a good strong two wheeled hand truck to make moving it around easy (beats the heck out of dragging it)."
4,"Not exactly what I was looking for, but it is a nice package.","Bought it for my mom thinking it was a different Garth Brooks collection (his entire discography, except Scarecrow), this isn't what I thought it was (seeing as it features a two disc concert recording in near-life quality) but it suited the occasion just fine. Now I just have to round up a couple of the cds that are in the discography and I'll have a very nice collection."
5,Greatest Country Singer,"I am a big fan of Country music only because it's in my blood. Most of my kin are from anywhere and everywhere where they listen to the Country great ones. Now if you are just like me and you love Country music and you love the great ones and you know what a Boot Scootin Boogie is or an Akey Breaky Heart then you know how much I just am so exstatic about this gift set. So get your star studded cloths on, put your ten gallon hat on, and go online and purchase this gift set because I guarantee you'll dance, sing, and start doin the two step to this country collection. Garth Brooks rocks!"
2,SOUND IS AWFUL,THIS IS A GREAT DVD BUT THE SOUND IS AWFUL. EITHER TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW. BUT GREAT FOR ANY GUMBY FAN.
4,"Excellent Seat, Excellent Value","We bought this seat as a second for my husband's car because we have been so happy with the infant Evenflo seat we had. The seat was reasonably easy to install in his Honda Accord with the LATCH system. The only real issue we had was the installation of the arms on the side which ARE REQUIRED, and a real *itch. My son frequently gets them undone SOMEHOW and we have yet to find a foolproof method to keep them locked in."
3,Grandma's car seat,"We purchased this seat for our grandson.The latch clips fall down the strap and need to be retrieved for each use. This is not a new problem. We put a rivet in the strap of a car seat 20 years ago to prevent this. I suspect a rivet in the strap would compromise safety now days. I won't recommend that nor would I do it again.The flip top holder they call a storage accessory looks remarkably like an an ashtray. That accessory won't last long anyway, it keeps falling off. We like the cup holder.This product did not come with a users manual. I suspect it was simply missing. I found it on-line at the evenflo.com web site. Look for it under replacement parts.There are plenty of adjustments available. The strap adjustments are easy to accomplish - even with a squirming toddler.The seat belts into our caravan simply and sturdily.I have used better (and worse) car seats/boosters but for the money I think perhaps my score of 3 stars may be a bit low..... lets call it 3 1/2."
1,Only If You Have to Have the Stars,"This dvd would be an okay runthrough of 60's drek if not for the jerky editing and the bleeped words. The film was apparently obtained from a tv distribution company which has bleeped out some of the words for a tv showing. It may not bother all, but I find it maddening. None of the stars is at their best here. In fact, I've never seen John Saxon this bad. I wish more care had been taken with the release--as it is, I keep wanting to pitch my copy out. Simitar has done much, much better elsewhere."
2,Brevity chagrin,"The brief, magazine sized document is very weak on 19th century developments. Nothing is given about 4-wheel wood framed wagons adapted to swivel trucks for 8-wheels; nothing about livestock (cattle) cars; nothing about evolution of box cars; nothing about evolution to metal hopper cars and tank cars; even worse, there is nothing about mail or caboose cars."
4,Railroad Freight Cars,Good general review of the history of freight equipment used by railroads as well as an overview of current rolling stock. This is a good introductory book for those interested in rail history.
3,great track choice but terrible sound quality!,"I don't understand. I own all the others CD's from this sery ""Classic Alternatives"" , they are all great but the track listing of this one is particularly awesum !The big big problem is with the sound quality. Have they taken a listen to it before mastering the CD's?Some tracks are very, very hissy (has they were coming from an old tape) , the sound on some others is compressed as it was coming from a commercial FM radio station. It's sad, very very sad because this is really one of the best 80's compilation available around.So you are warned. If you were planing to get on CD some stuff you have on vinyl to get a cleaner sound, then try to find some others 80's compilations. If you only want this compilation to have some great tracks to dance or similar, it's ok."
3,pretty decent,"pretty good mixes if you're into the groups on the cd's. some of the songs i like a lot, and some of them aren't that great. but it's definately worth checking out if you're into old synthpop/80's electro-pop, or want to brush up on the roots of the dancier goth/ebm/futurepop groups of today."
1,"Some great tracks, Poor Sound","Not much to say, some great tracks that I long to have for CD version BUT totally let down by the sound qualities."
1,Only a Hardcopy of the online docs!,"This book is only a paper version of the online docs.One particular peeve I have with this book (and the online documentation) is the loose use of the phrase ""in script"". Too often the reader is left trying to contextually determine if the book is referring to server side VBScript, server side JScript, client side VBScript, or client side JScript."
2,Too browser specific,"When I started this book it looked pretty good, but by the middle I found that it was only creating pages that would work on IE and even that was a chore. I need to design pages that fit a wide variety of browsers, and this book does not nearly fit the bill."
3,Good book for novice,I agree with the other reviews. This is a hard copy of online docs and the friendship database you can get off of the microsoft site for free. Invest your money in another book if you already have experience with SQL and Interdev. I give it 3 stars because I think it would be a good book for beginners.
1,A lot of off topic content,"Perhaps it should be re-named Hands on Visual Interdev 6 and get your hands on Visual Studio 6 Enterprise Edition.I was hoping for a book to introduce me to Visual Interdev 6, and how to connect to Access databases. I found a lot of the content was not on topic at all. How to design a web site, how to use Visual Source Safe, how to manage Corporate development teams etc. etc. This was not why I purchased the book. It would be better if the author had used that space to cover topics not even mentioned in the book at all, like searching for records in a database via a web form.The very first database chapter presumes the user has SQL Server 6.5, and clearly states you must have this to complete the chapter. You can imagine my disapointment. I don't own SQL Server 6.5 or Visual Source Safe, I am a single designer and don't really care about team development concepts and management. What I care about is developing in Visual Interdev 6. This book was clearly the wrong choice."
5,Enjoyable,My Grade Three class really enjoys this dvd. When we have our gym class in the classroom. I simply put on the dvd and let the kids follow along. The video guides them correctly through the actions.
1,not what I expected ... not what I was looking for ... my daughter does not enjoy it,"Would never buy again. I was looking for a video to actually get my daughter trying and doing a yoga class ... this gives background, and is very very dull."
5,Spellbinding,I normally do not enjoy western writing. Gib held my attention through-out the book and shared some of the authors soul and spirit. I enjoyed this man's work on the same plain as Richard Bach.
1,DO NOT BUY,"this is a bad dvd. steve-o isnt even in half of it. its like some jackasses got the rights to steve-o's name and some steve-o footage and put themselves into it calling them steve-o's buddies. the only good steve-o video in this dvd is in his other 3 dvds, which are funny. the douche bags doing the prank arent funny, its kinda like candid camera. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!"
2,Pretty lame,"Yeah this is pretty stupid, I'd only recommend it to hardcore Steve-O fans, as there is a bit of footage I've never seen before. It might not get such bad reviews if it was produced better, the music gets quite irritating. Forget this crap and check out the National Lampoon Lost Reality series!"
1,Such bullshit,"To the people who bought this, sucks to be you.Steve-O did NOT put his name on this, and has absolutely nothing to do with this DVD. Do not buy it."
1,Awful,"Do not buy this vid, rent it if you absolutely positively want to say you have seen ""everything Steve-O"". I was reluctant to even give it a single star because there was nothing lower than that.Remember the old ""don't send in your submissions because we won't open them"" blurb at the beginning of Jackass? It's there for a reason, to spare the audience from having to see fannish material on this level. Most of this backyard produced looking stuff would have been better off on YouTube or Brickfist had those sites been around when this vid came out.You get about 15 minutes tops of very early Steve-O material and the rest of it is filler."
2,Steve O,I Was Disapointed In This One. There Wasnt Much Steve In This Dvd. But The Parts He Was In Where Great. If Your A HardCore Steve O Fan You Should Have It.
3,"Ok, but others are better.","This is a book of essays on business ethics that suffers badly from the limitations of the genre - 'you write about this aspect, he'll write about that, she'll write about the other'. The result, inevitably, is a set of parts that fail to make a whole, even though some of the parts are good. It is mostly written in a folksy style with a lot of personal anecdote, which will appeal to some.In general, it is long on how you ought to behave and what you ought to do, and short on serious examination of the system conditions that will encourage and reward ethical behaviour. It is also, unlike Paine's Value shift, short on recognition of ethics and economics as separate, sometimes complementary and equally important domains."
4,A good surprise,"When I started reading the book I thought it was another book like any other, but as I read I realized that the book was very well handled, with a deep research about the topic. Certainly there is much to learn by reading this book. It was a pleasant surprise, with a reading light and pleasant."
3,"Entertaining, but not terribly original...","I found Miss Gazillions to be an entertaining beach read, fluffy, fun, and fast paced, but...I'm a big Truman Capote fan and there are several passages in the book that practically parrot Breakfast at Tiffany's, and the similarities in language and content are quite obvious and rather irksome."
1,"Pompous, dreadful",Really awful amateur work. I loathe the BJP but this work has about it a certain crude sensationalism and a teenage attempt at 'style' evident in the author's desription of the book - all staccato sentences and a pompous conviction of profundity that is just plain annoying. Might have exotic appeal to a foreigner but is too superficial a treatment of the issue.And by the way - the trick of getting your friends to write reviews is kinda see-through.
3,APC Battery Replacement,The batteries arrived just as said. After pulling out the old ones I discovered that the connectors on the the new ones were different. I had to swap ends before installing. Once replaced the install went without further issue.
3,"Wrong Part, Worked Anyhow","So, the website helpfully had me input the model number to ensure I got the right part.Nope.Good news is that a little ingenuity, a knife, some strapping tape, and the wrong part was converted over into something that worked. A satisfactory outcome since I was at a distant customer site, otherwise I'd have had to return the part I had received and make a second trip."
1,DOES NOT FIT ALL MODELS LISTED,"This item does not fit the 'xs-1500'.It fits the xs series only up to 'xs-1000', and certain other series' up to 1500. To top it off, Amazon does not allow returns on hazardous items.You can fit it to the xs-1000 by:1 cutting the tape/seal both sides, above & below adapter plate.2 dis-assembling from wiring harness.3 place batteries side-by-side, orient to match old batteries.4 use jumper from old batteries to connect in series (+of one battery to -of other).5 connect black cable to '-'6 slide into the UPS, connecting red cable to '+' terminal when it reaches."
5,Replacement UPS RS/XS/ht 1500 Battery,I first reviewed the installation process on YouTube before removing the old battery and installing the replacement battery. ( I highly recommend viewing the video.) The battery arrived prior to the arrival date and has performed perfectly. I would definitely recommend this product and the seller.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Usually I am extremely happy with purchases from Amazon, and if a product is defective, they make the situation right. There is always an exception to every rule and this is it. The negative reviews are correct; the replacement batteries don't work and you cannot ship them back to Amazon. You are stuck with no way to get a refund on your money! I ordered replacement batteries for an APC Back UP RS 1500 and an APC Back Up XS 1000, both batteries being manufactured by APC. The cost was was $156.56 which I might as well have flushed down the toilet. Knowing that there is no way to remedy the situation if the product is defective, Amazon should not be selling this item. Also, as other's have mentioned, if Amazon can ship them to you, why can't they accept them back? The situation most definitely changes my opinion about purchasing from Amazon."
3,Generally Good Quality Products but a warning,"I have found APC's products very useful in the past. So I gave it a decent rating. But I cannot use this one because I assumed in the title RS followed by 1500VA meant it was compatible with the RS 1500 model. It is not. And now I have a 70 dollar paperweight until I buy the model that actually works with it. If I wanted to be positive I guess I have a reason to buy a second battery backup now.I understand why batteries are non-returnable, but that only serves to make me more paranoid when considering buying another battery from them. Learn from my mistake and triple check what you are actually getting."
3,It did work.,This item was supposed to fit the model of APC that I have but I had to disassemble the replacement battery and use part of the old unit with the new batteries to get it to fit. It does work and I am happy I didn't have to send it back.
5,Fantastic,"Genuine APC battery, looked just exactly like the battery from 2006 that came out of my tall thin XS 1500, the batteries are on top of each other, grey piece in the center, with instructions from APC.This is the best value unless you want to get third party batteries of the same size and wire them into the harness yourself.Fixed my problem, now for another 6 years of service ;)"
1,not good,"I received this at the beginning of April 2012. On May 28, 2012 the power went out for the first time since then. The battery lasted only 5 minutes or less before shutting the power supply down. I can barely make it to my computer in less than 5 minutes. The original battery would last for at least 15 minutes.I think you should expect more from a new battery."
4,Works but had to be reconfigured!,"When I got this, it appeared to be the wrong model and wasn't going to fit, despite Amazon saying it would. I decided to try and MAKE it work and ended up being able to get the battery to work perfectly just be reconfiguring it side-by-side instead of on top of each other as the two daisy chained batteries came. Took about 3 minutes to do and worked perfect after I was done. Just keep that in mind in case you buy this and it doesn't seem to fit. With a bit of reconfiguring, it will work!"
4,Great replacement for the Back-ups,When I received the shipment. The connector was crushed due to insufficient package protection. Amazon immediately delivered the replacement shipment next day. The battery was installed to the unit within 10 minutes and it works beautifully. The service provided by Amazon is excellent. The missing star for this product is due to the insufficiency in the manufacturer packaging design.
3,Not exactly as advertised,"The battery I received was not the APC branded item shown in the photo. It did fit my APC Back-UPS XS 1500 okay except that, unlike the old battery, I had to twist the flat battery cable to align the connectors. It appears to function okay and the replace-battery lamp is now off. Includes a return shipping label for the old battery but shipping is not free."
3,No difference from cheaper battery,"I wrote some comments about my purchase of two APC UPS batteries, including this one, at http://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Cartridge-Back-ups-500-1000VA-RBC32/dp/B00094OX2S/ref=pd_cp_e_1I want to reiterate them here. These batteries are not returnable so make sure you purchase the correct one for your unit. I bought the one on this page for my 1500VA and inadvertently ordered another one on another page for the RS500 (I actually needed a battery for the CS500). In addition to the return problem, I discovered that the RS500 battery is also a RBC32 battery, just like the one on this page. But it's about $[...] cheaper. I have inspected both batteries and there is not a whit of difference on the outside except a serial number. So why is one more expensive than the other?"
2,Decided to replace my APC UPS after I got a dud replacement battery,"I've been using APC UPS's for at home many years merely to protect my PC from power problems. The battery on my old 1500 W APC UPS finally died. The Amazon replacement battery wouldn't charge up. Amazon was good about giving me a credit for the faulty replacement battery. This battery was very difficult to install in my old APC UPS because the cable is short and stiff. Anyway, I decided to scrap the old APC UPS and I bought a new CyberPower UPS from Amazon instead. APC products are more pricey and I couldn't see an advantage sticking with their products."
4,It works.,I bought this battery to replace the original batter in my UPS and it is working as expected after sufficient charging.
2,Not so great,"One must respect the effort to present a collection of spiritual insights and simple techniques. But these days you would expect to find this level of material on a web site or blog. Indeed you can, and rather easily too. So the question is why spend the money to buy the book?The content in well intentioned but lacks depth. Sadly, I didn't find much here to recommend."
3,an interesting tale of white woman's journey through africa,"Ffyona Campbell has determination, guts, and a talent for describing her surroundings in an entertaining way.The only disappointment with this book was the tendency to ""waffle"" about personal relationships adnd problems with her sponsors.The book is balanced by also dwelling on the less savoury elements of the walk (harassment, etc) rather than only portraying the good/interesting experiences.The photos of removing jiggers from severly blistered feet has my stomach squirming!"
3,Socialism seems to lose something as it goes from theory into practice,"Well-written, full of details, some good analysis but a bit of a snore at times.The problem may not be Howe's but socialism's, which may sound strong in theory and yet weak in practice.The historical materialism is helpful. Excellent chapter on Eugene Debs and his impact. A good chapter on socialism in the 1930's...when FDR's New Deal undercut worker need for socialism.Why did socialism fail in America? Where did it succeed? Did it fail in America because of conditions unique to America or because of the same general failings that beset socialism everywhere.In the final chapter, Howe finally focuses on socialism's failing but 40-odd pages hardly seems enough to address the problems socialism has. Howe cites some lessons, including the inability of the working class to lead the way and problems with economic planning, but leaves a lot open. Socialism remains as an apparent moral need with no good path."
3,Buy With a Bottle of Glue...,"Or you may lose a few pages.The first day of use a pair of sheets came undone. I glued them in and now another set is coming out. The mathematical material looks well done and is nice pedagogical work. I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars for that, but the physical packaging--a responsibility of the publisher--is terrible. Why didn't they sew in the pages of a math text, which always can be counted on to receive heavy use? The first day of use and it begins to fall apart, too! Glue alone is not enough; I've owned cheap paperback novels which were bound more durably. Shame on Springer, a venerable science publisher!"
2,Disappointing,"After Mark Cotta Vaz's adequate first volume, I was hoping for a follow-up from Ruditis that at least matched it and hopefully surpassed it. Sorry. Didn't happen.This guide is kinda flashy but isn't constructed well. It's written as fiction, like you've been handed a dossier on Sydney Bristow and the gang and are having their missions explained to you. But all the energy spent on assigning made up file numbers and access codes comes across as taking focus off the show and sounds just plain corny. As usual with Ruditis books, there's little real-life info on the show. Do they not like this guy?If you've collected the 'Alias' magazine, you've got a thousand times more info than you'll get from this. For the completist only."
5,No longer wondering,"While riding the logging roads between La Push and the Makha reservation in NW WA. I often wondered what the grades and elevations were of those steep hills I was going up and down. Saw the VDO MC1.0+ on Amazon for $69 and bought it. Its been fun, easy to setup and has answered my questions."
4,Lots of good functions,"This is one of the handiest gadgets around. The thermometer and road gradient functions are particularly useful, and I use them often on the road. The setup is a little complex, but the instructions are good. Worth the money."
2,Can't use at night,"I commute regularly when it is dark, and I noticed once that my speedometer said I was travelling at 38 MPH while I was stopped at a signal with my foot on the ground. It took me a while to figure out that the inaccurate data always appeared when I had my light on at night. The EM field around my 1.5 watt bike light was interfering with the wireless receptor. It just doesn't seem right that my computer is inoperable when it is dark, near power lines, or I suppose any other electro-magnetic field. This will be my last wireless cycling computer. I would much rather have a line running down my forks than inaccurate data whenever I pass within a stone's throw of something electrical. I like the features of this computer, but I can't trust it will give me accurate data."
2,Signal Problems??,"I really wanted this to work, but with the apparent outside interference and the random altimeter swings, I had to return it. In my office, which had one computer and a cell phone, it showed I was traveling over 50 mph. And standing still on a very flat road I had an elevation gain of 10ft and suddenly a drop of 20ft. Since most of the reviews are good, I will assume I just got a bad one, but I will buy a gps just to be sure."
5,Ultimate relax songs,"Although this is just the single of Flemming's debut-album, it is well worth listening to! The single contains four songs which have just one purpous: to let you chill.Name? is famous because of its funky bass-loop and has a nice, optimistic melody.Never Show Your Weakness is a fragile guitar-song, portraying the weakness of humanrelationships. Therefore, the song is very recognizable. The Water's Rising is instrumental, and has a tune that is not easy to forget.The single is a fine example of the full debut-album and sounds creative, original and fresh. I liked it very much."
3,TITLE COPPED!,"Yes, we've all seen and are quite weary by now of NASA/Goddard theatrics (would that Mark Goddard of ""Lost in Space""the-series would have lent his narrative skills to the project to make it more bearable). TRITE is not the original, I say again O R I G I N A L ""Men in Space"" T.V. show with Bill Lundigan! Pop an episode in the player - if you can FIND! Now THERE was a (Geo)Palian program for all!"
5,"I'm more the ""O Brother"" edgy type person Amazon described, but I still love this CD","Heard the ""Jennys"" when Prairie Home Companion was broadcast live from Boston just the other night. Their harmonies and delivery are very impressive. While these girls don't have the edge that Amazon's reviewers thought I'd appreciate, I very much enjoy the harmony and their lyrics do not at all lend to easy listening."
5,great album,the songs are catchy and the harmonies are incredible. If you liked their first album this one is even better. Great music!
4,good groundhog - looks like punxsutawney phil,"I bought this groundhog for a groundhog's day party. He is perfect - the party was at a bar so he got tossed around a bit - his hat and tie are sewn on well, so he stayed in one piece throughout the whole party. as with most beanie babies, he's well made, fairly accurate, and soft."
3,"Truly powerful, but winds down in cloying sitcom fashion","Man, this book captured me...for the first 2/3rds. I didn't know just *how* deeply involved I was with the characters until a pivotal event (which the author handles *so* expertly) made me burst into tears. My reaction surprised me...until I realized the book had been sneaking up on me and subtly, skillfully pulling me into its world.But then Holt damages the emotional truth she's established by forcing the characters to perform selfless acts that don't ring true, ultimately compromising the book with sentimentality and a ""good for you"" ending. I wish she'd stuck to her guts."
3,The Freak show,This book is about a really fat kid named Zachary that is a freak show. He lives in a trailer and everyone always comes to see him. One day his owner leaves him and says he will be back in a few days. Well these two kids Toby and Cal become friends with him and they learn about his life and everything else about him. The police said if his owner Paulie is not back two weeks or so he will have to send him to social service home. You have to read the book to find out if he goes or not.This book is really funny so I hope you get a chance to read it and if you like books about friendship then you will really like it. A part that I did not like about this book is the part when everyone made fun of Zachary
3,When Zachary Beaver Came to Town BY Willis Magahee,"Toby and Cal are best friends. They live in a small Texas town called Antler. Nothing really exciting ever happens there, until Zachary Beaver arrives, that is. Zachary Beaver is the fattest boy in the world. Fascinated by him, Cal and Toby go visit him. Zachary is rude, harsh, and fat. But something keeps drawing them to him. They continue visiting him and without even realizing it, they develope a friendship with Zachary. The summer of '71 is filled with excitement and adventure, Toby's mom going to Nashville to be a country western singer, Cal's brother going to Vietnam, and of course, Zachary Beaver. Toby is in for a summer unlike any other, a summer sure to change his life forever.Kimberly Willis Holt does a great job of combining humor and drama, but still allows it to be real. This whimsical adventure of Cal and Toby will be sure to keep you wanting more."
3,When Zachary Beaver Came to Town,"Toby's mom was going to be in a country singing contest. Then she never came back, Toby's parents split up.Zachary came to town and he was the talk of the town. Everybody went to see him; pepole paid to go see him. People would come by and drop off bags of food for him. People all over Texas pay two dollars to see Zachary,then make fun of him and ask him rude questions about how much he eats.Zachary was a lier; he never went to all those places he said had gone to. Cal and Toby and everybody else helped Zachary get baptized.They also took him to the drive in movie theatre. Cal and Toby thought he was mean at first, but as the book continued he changed. They didn't even want to get to know him better. In Antler, Texas he changed and he made a few friends."
3,The interesting facts about zachary beaver,"Title: When Zachary Beaver Came to TownAuthor: Kimberly Willis Holt# of pages: 227Genre: Realistic FictionBrief summary: This book is about a boy name Toby. He just came to Texas. His best friend name is Cal who brother is going to fight in the Vietnam War. I like this book because it has a lot of information that happens in Texas, and about two boys who are best friends."
3,When Zachary beaver came to town.,"THe book 'When Zachary Beaver came to town' was in general a good book. I thought it was some what boring at times but it had great detail and a great plot. The books about a guy, and when his mom goes away a guy who says hes the fatest man in the world and his owner come to town problems arise. After his owner leaves, the police get involved. Zach claims he knows nothing, though every1 knows he knows where he is. Everything becames a mystery."
4,The different point of view,"At first, I was not sure I liked the book.A few days later I began to understand the book better and enjoyed it much more than I had before.I liked it so much because it had a different way of seeing things , that it may be something we all can relate too,and to know that life is full of surprises and you have to adapt to it.I also like it because I live in a small town too.(And there is nothing to do here either!)"
1,When Zachary Beaver Came To Town,"The book is about Zachary. Zachary is a very fat teenager. It was also about Toby. Toby's mother left the home. A guy named Cal is in it. He's brother went to fight in the Vietnam War.The part I hate the most was when something happened to Cal's brother.My favorite part was when Zachary got baptized.I didn't like the book because it didn't have hardly any action, it's too boring, and too sad. It was nothing but talk, it was slow and too pitiful. It was disappointing and low rated. They hardly did anything big. It was too hart breaking."
4,It works.,"It takes a few minutes to stuff your mat in there, but you'll get in there. It's light weight, color is bright and does the job."
2,"Very light weight, bulky to pack","The stuff sack is very light weight and feels sturdy, even though the handle wasn't sewn in properly. To insert the pad, the pad is folded in half. If you like to attach the pad on the outside of your backpack consider a full length sack instead."
3,It's a bag!,"This is a fairly durable bag but it is just a stuff sack. For the price you pay for a Therm-a-Rest, it really should of been included with the bedroll. So, if you are not into cordinated camping gear, boycot and buy a cheaper stuff sack."
1,really not good,"compared to ""neives de enero"" album,this album is more of a mariachi style and has some lives songs that sound awful."
5,LA BABY FOLDING FULL SIZE CRIB IS GREAT!,"This crib is great, my family has a small summer home in Califonia, and instead of using our pack-n-play, I wanted a full size crib for my son. But I didn't want something that would take up any space when we were not there since the home is used by other family members and friends. This crib is sturdy, easy to set up, move if needed, and take down. We can store it under a bed with ease. It's basic white color and metal bars give it almost a vintage look, and it's unobtrusive. I would definitely purchase again."
5,This crib really is great!,"This is a very sturdy crib that folds up easily. It is institutional quality (I first saw one at my daughter's daycare center)and it has lasted through a few babies. I've had quality and safety problems with other cribs, but this one is a winner."
3,I'm disapointed...,"I know a lot of people loved this series but I didn't. The idea was good but I just didn't like it. The first book was a 9, the second was a 7, but this one was a 5. Jenny should have dumped Tom & go with Julian. Tom was such a wimp. Julian would have been a much better choice & he wasn't really evil."
5,One of the best books i've ever read!!!,These books (especially number 3) are absolutly brilliant. The plot is consistantly action packed and emotional. Most of the characters develop really well throughout the books and there is an obvious change in their attitudes at the end. The stories are a cross between horror and romance and some parts are so moving and of course there was Julian! I think me and the rest of the female population really want a Julian in our lifes after those books.I always cry at films but this was the first book i've ever cried at before. I sat in my bed at midnight sobbing my heart out but although it was sad it couldn't really have ended any other way and there is a small amount of hope at the end.If you haven't read this trilogy what are you doing!?! I read these in five days when i should have been doing revision but i was just so hooked. They are a must for everyone even if you don't like reading i promise that you will enjoy these books.
5,Amazing,"L.J. Smith is absolutely amazing! The Forbidden Game Trilogy are my favorite books. The characters are easy to sympathize with. They are all the kind of people everyone knows. Except Julian. He is too exotic and powerful to live in this world. I fell in love with him, though. I highly recommend everyone to read these books. Warning: you'll need tissues in the end."
5,I read this book and fell in love with it!,"I just love L.J. Smith books. This was prabably her absolute best. I cried at the end when Jullian died and a part of me died too. If I were Jenny I would pick Jullian over Tom any day. At the end she didn't even tell him that she loved him (which she did, love him I mean) when he was dying. L.J. Smith should add a fourth book to this series as Jullian coming back as a normal, every day, high school boy. She did it in Vampire Diaries, why not now"
2,There are better books out there,"The book covers a lot of good information, but it is poorly written and not laid out well. The first chapter rambles on for pages at a time about physical features on the moon and never shows a picture or map of where the feature is. For the current price (under $10) its not a total loss, but this is the second Firefly book I have read and they were both pretty bad.Bottom Line: Bad book - Buy Exploring the Moon by Steve Massey instead."
5,"Great taste, kids love taking their vitamin C!!",These chewable tablets are a great way to get your kids to get more vitamin C in their diet. They have a great taste and won't upset tummies.
4,enjoyable but too brief,"I found this video interesting because I used to like watching Steve Allen on TV years ago. Pay attention to the word ""Introduction"" in the DVD's title. The 80-minute DVD left me wanting a lot more material to work on. Steve has large hands and made liberal use of 10ths with his left hand. My hands are too small to play tenths, so many of the songs I can't play. Steve mentions other Homespun instruction tapes and working with a private piano teacher, so he obviously knows that his lesson is not enough. It comes with music shrunk down to about 75% and stuffed inside the DVD plastic box. It seems best suited as a motivational and informative video one would check out of a library to view once. It is enjoyable to watch."
2,"Resounding ""Meh""","Superthief reads more like a self written biography than it does a crime/suspense story. Porello explains that Phil's 1200 page manuscript was the basis for this story and In my opinion, it really shows. The book recounts phils' life story in a ""and then, and then , and then"" fashion. We don't get much build up to the bigger moments, little to no foreshadowing, and details that seem very important are completely glossed over. A decent story which really suffers from poor writing and editing, you would be better off catching similarly themed books ""Killing Pablo"" or ""The Ballad of the Whisky Robber"""
4,SUPERTHIEF...SUPER READ!,"Rick Porrello's knowledge of the underworld gives his writing unique insight and as in his previous book 'To kill the Irishman:The War that crippled The Mafia,' and now in Superthief he is able to strip away the glamour and prestige of a career crook to reveal the stark and gritty reality of Cleveland criminality that is murder; prison time and broken lives.One of Porrello's many talents is his ability to tell the tale of an incredible crime caper at an exciting, swift-paced tempo in a way many writers would envy but readers will relish."
5,True Crime at its best,"Superthief strips away the glitz and glamour of Hollywood's portrayal of crime. A great narrative that gives the reader an inside look at the real underworld and the harsh realities of doing scores, getting pinched, pulling time and doing time"
3,lukewarm,"I am pretty lukewarm after having just finished it. I guess I was craving a little more action. There were some interesting and thought provoking ideas including the 'interview' format. That said, it just didn't pack any punch. Even the way the protagonist thwarts the antagonist is very very lackluster. Overall, some interesting sci-fi concepts that could have been ratcheted up a few levels."
1,Save your money.,"Pohl is a great writer. This is a horrible book. I picked up a copy of the hardcover for 1$ at a used book store, after reading half the book I wanted my money back. The plot is dull, unimagantive and boring. This book is a fight againts continual bordem to read. Pohl recounts page afer page of redunt ""daily life"" information. The plot creeps along at a snail's pace without any suprises. I kept reading the book in the hope that it would show some some hint of value, it never did. Simply not worth it."
1,Unacceptable color shifts!!,"I bought this printer as a replacement for the Epson 1270, which Epson bought back from me when they had to admit that the stability of the prints couldn't live up to what was advertised. I had read good reviews of the stability of the prints from this printer (100-200 years) and I have no reason to doubt that. HOWEVER, the quality of the prints from the 2000p is a big step down from the 1270. What renders this printer unacceptable is that the characteristics of the pigments are such that the color of the prints shifts dramatically when viewing them in different kinds of light. You would basically need to print two sets of your images - one for artificial light and one for daylight. Since most people view their prints in varying mixtures of the two, you can never achieve accurate color. It seems Epson never ventures out of their laboratories and into the real world when testing their creations."
3,A bit disappointing,"I work with photography, and I do a lot of work on Photoshop and Fine Art printing.The results I got on Glossy and Premium Semigloss photo paper where really good,sharpness seems better than 1270.When it cames to color, things take a different shape, especially on Archival Mate Papers and Lumijet Fine Art Papers, the results doesn't impress that much, and the 1270 shows a large superiority.The software seems quite complete, but actually doesn't help much. You are probably better using it all on Automatic settings. I say this after spending weeks, lots of papers and ink, testing the configurations that lacks a good manual.I must say that for the kind of work I do, I was disappointed with the results.I Didn't get the feedback and professional results It was expected."
2,Disappointment,"Roessler and Decker discuss emotional aspects of illness in terms of emotional problems and emotional disorders. The editors fail to acknowledge the positive value of emotions in the process of healing. Further, the book fails to indicate the role of the physician's compassion. In this day and age of HMO assembly line health care, this text might have considered the emotional effect of non-compassionate medical personnel on those suffering poor health. While the last chapter, entitled Psychological Adjustment to Physical Trauma and Disability, sounds promising, it is far too brief."
4,Good option,"My wife and used to watch this when it was on TV. Now we have a 13 years old and we showed her some episodes. She liked it, so we decided to by."
2,Great series ruined on DVD,"Not only is the title song not that great but most if not all of the original songs that were used throughout the series are missing. This is from season 3 through the end.What was great about series like Dawson and Felicity, etc. were the introduction of music cd's released with unknown but catchy tunes. Just isn't the same as it used to be."
3,"Dawson's Creek, Sixth Season","Something was beginning to be missed by the time this season started. For example, they kept reducing Michelle Williams roles and she is actually the best actor of the bunch. Perhaps it has to do with the writer, Tom Kapinos, or the fact that everything was about the talentless, Katie Holmes."
2,Joey's Creek.,"Dawson's Creek - The Complete Sixth Season is the last season of this once-intelligent teen drama. The last episode is such a letdown, Joey picks Pacey over Dawson, I hate that! It ruined my life for a week, seriously. Episodes leading up to the finale were pretty horrific, well at least Joey got to sleep with Dawson for the first time, but their stormy relationship was not meant to be. Dawson is rarely featured in this season, the show focuses too much on Joey and she is an annoying character with all her boy drama. The only thing I liked about this season is the strong friendship between Jen and Jack. Skip this season, it ain't worth it."
1,the service SUCKS!,"It's been a month now, and still no product arrived. It sucks that the only answer you get is he ""sent"" it already. No solid answer or atleast a word of assurance that the item will be replaced. THE SERVICE SUCKS!!!!!!! DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!"
2,I can't believe I sat through this entire season,No wonder they stopped at season 6. It was incredibly boring and pointless. What was the point of audrey? she has no talent whatsoever and Joey really got on my nerves this season. I think she should have been the one to die in the end. Why were Dawson and Pacey so in love with her? She's not that great looking!!! I only watched this because I wanted to see the very last episode which was another dissapointment. The only cool thing about this whole season was when Jack and the cop got together.
1,product information request..review before review!,I would like to see more details on this dvd before considering a purchase. It badly lacks information. Nowhere does it detail the movies etc included in this 'classic collection'. Even a back view may have revealed the contents. Very disappointing!
5,Interesting Combination of Art History and Animation,"My wife (an art major) and I (a hobbyist animator) saw the title feature on PBS' ""The Territory"" last night, great fun trying to guess all the many art works. Munch's ""Scream"", Warhol's Marilyn, Picasso, etc., etc. Sort of a stream of consciousness dream tour through a really good modern art museum, via a cool animation technique (""clay painting"" I think they called it - more 2D than claymation)."
5,Upscale Quality at discount price!,"Georgeous sweater. Raffi sweaters do not disappoint! Finest Merino wool, sell for up to $100 in Men's boutique stores. I bought this in beige, which was a beautiful taupy oatmeal color. My Dad loved it."
1,Perpetuating ignorance is non-productive...,"The Card catalog description for this book on Amazon states:>""A geologist goes back in time to study dinosaurs and finds them living along with man,civilization, and extraterrestrial beings.""This book could easily be the poster child for ignorance!This book proves without a doubt that anyone with enough money can publish anynonsense they wish, and claim it is fact in spite of overwhelming evidence to thecontrary!I would not be the least bit surprised if Segraves claims that the moon is composed of green cheese in his next ""so-called"" book!After all, Segraves has also written that UFO's are actually piloted by angels!Ignorance is indeed rampant!"
1,A Disappointment,"I bought this item a couple of years ago. The company that makes it is very good about backing up their warranty and sending replacement parts. The problem is the birdbath constantly has parts breaking so after awhile you just give up. Either the motor gives out, or the solar panel (I've replaced each 2-3 times) or the coating on the bowl starts flaking off. Another problem is unless there is direct, full sun the unit shuts off. A cloud passing by shuts it off, your shadow shuts it off, etc.It's a great idea but poorly executed."
1,Bad Experience..Manufacturer Disconnected Phone!,"We received the birdbath and it worked OK for two days, then the pump stopped working entirely. Like the other reviewer below, we tried ""tweaking"" for hours on end, but to no avail.I attempted to contact the manufacturer (STI Group) directly but their phone number is disconnected. I am now returning the item to Amazon as I have no other choice. BEWARE OF THIS ITEM AND COMPANY!!!"
1,Broken Solar Panel,We received shipment within 5 days of placing order. Upon opening the box we saw that the inside box was crushed but the outside box that it was shipped in was in perfect condition so we know that the damage was not done by shiping.Solar panel was totally smashed along with conections for the pump were cracked off. I called customer service and was told that a replacement would be sent within 10 working days. It is now almost 4 weeks and we still have not recieved anything. Very disapointed. Beware!!
3,Just Ok,"The solar fountain pump only works in full sun. The ""resin"" finish looks like plastic. Would not reccomend it. The pump does work well, when the sun is shining right on the solar panel. I was looking for something a little more elegant."
2,Poor customer service,"During ther first year of use the paint in the bowl came off. After 10 calls to the company, and receiving 10 promises that someone would call us back to resolve the problem, we have given up and will not use this company agian."
2,This unit needs a lot of work,After all the complaints why doesnt smart solar improve this product. Its a great looking bath but the pump needs to be completely designed. My pump lasted one season and never worked again regardless of how many parts SS tried to send . It did not work. So I suggest this to all who have this bird bath. Buy a water wiggler which runs on batteries and it will give water ripples which will keep mosquitoes from hatching and birds like it. You could go the extra mile and get the lighted wiggler for about $40. Two premium flashlight batteries will run it all summer. This will work sun or no sun.
3,A good product for the price,"Recently I discovered solar powered bird baths. A local store had some but were pretty high priced so while looking for something more resonable, came across this one. And with free shipping. The bird bath is very easy to set up out of the carton and instructions were very clear. Having used solar power before on my boat, I was a little dissappointed in the operation of the pump. It works fine during the middle of the day when the sun is directly overhead, but early mornings and late afternoon does not produce enough light for this product. I still think it a good deal for the money, but am now looking for one with a better solar setup. Probably one with the solar panel mounted off of the bath so it can be angled to catch more sunlight."
3,Good book,I have read most of the chapters and they all seem very intersting in the sense of research and education.
2,Complete but lengthy.,"This books suffers from the modern ""flashy textbook"" disease plaguing modern texts. Altough the layout is good eyecandy, the text is overblown and could be half the length without damagaing the contents. I can recommend it for those interested in the field, but consider getting a smaller/shorter book."
3,Song of the simple truth,"This volume was ok. I did not like the fact that the editor/translator failed to include the original publication year of the poems and the name of the original book that the poems came from. Other than that, it is a very extensive collection of poems by Julia de Burgos."
5,psychology of the hero soul,The book gives excellent insight into the nature of the subconscious mindand how it works. And what it takes to become a hero soul.
3,OK,"I thought it was OK. I bought it as I thought the excerpts on Amazon sounded really good, and it had great reviews, but I haven't yet figured out why it got such great reviews. Apparently, the excerpt I read was the best part of the book. I have nothing bad to say about it as there is nothing bad about it; I've just read better."
1,Boring,"Boring, badly written, never was able to finish this book. Sent it to the clous to get it off my tablet."
5,The White League,This book kept my interest the entire way through. I will reread the book at some time. This book also was a good history lesson great for people interested in history and human relations.
2,An anachronistic exercise,"The White LeagueThe story might have had appeal to readers in the 1960's or earlier, but hardly in this century. The characters are artificial and the events highly contrived. The writing lacks beats to keep the reader involved. Flashbacks interrupted the flow of the action and could have better served as a prologue. The premise of the story and its denouement fail to provide satisfaction for the effort expended.D K Elliott; Author, The Canyon Caper"
4,The White League,"Took a long time getting into it. Struggled to pick it up and continue reading. About three quarters of the way through, it finally clicked. Enjoyed it but probably wouldn't put it high on the list to read or pass on to others."
5,Great story!,"I loved the story and smart presentation of history and character development. Zigal is now part of my ""required reading"" author list."
3,mostly sweets,"When I looked at the picture I thought that this item was gourmet cheese and caviar, and things of that nature. Rather, it is mostly candy and sweets. That was somewhat disappointing. Would not buy again."
5,"Perfect Display Gift Boxes 3.75""","I've ordered these silver cotton-filled gift boxes more than once, because they're perfect for displaying jewelry... bracelets, key chains, pendant necklaces and small collectibles. They're a perfect size, and reasonably priced, so my customers receive their purchased items boxed for free, and ready to give to friends and loved ones.These boxes are so attractive, that store customers walk right over to my display to see what's nestled in the cotton. I attribute many sales to these 2"" deep, 3.75"" square, versatile and lovely gift boxes.I'm also very appreciative to the seller for consistently providing fast, safe shipments.Many thanks from a small store owner!!!"
4,I like Sea Monsters don't ride motorcycles,I liked when they found out about when Eddies mom joined the motorcycle race. THe book was funny and adventurous. Jeanna age 10
1,Works - only until individual ink colors run out,"A single cartridge with multiple ink colors is a great example of a poor, short-sighted design. The ""HP 23 TriColor Ink Cartridge"" hits the bulls-eye on the target of bad design ideas. As soon as one color ink runs out it can have a dramatic and negative affect on some of the colors your ink cartridge can produce. As a result, your color printing can look off-color, to say the least. At worst, parts of your document are left blank! This forces many users to buy a new cartridge, even if ink remains with the other colors in the cartridge they're replacing.This tri-color ink cartridge design may be great for HP's bottom line, but it's bad for the consumer and the environment.I will never (again) buy any printing device that uses single multi-color ink cartridges. I recommend the same to all consumers. Look for - and demand - a printer that uses separate cartridges for each primary color."
3,Where's the DVD,"It's the 25th anniversary of the films' debut and I believe that it's high time for a special edition DVD to be released. I've noticed that ""Saturday Night Fever"" and that terrible movie ""Can't Stop the Music"" have already been released on DVD, so why not TGIF? Get with it Columbia!"
3,Fun to finally have on dvd,"This is not a great film, but it is a good fun B Film Miles ahead of the Village People's Can't Stop the Music. There are some gifted actors here; Goldblum; Winger Landsburg, et. al. And in a weirdly cheap way it has that Robert Altman multiple storylines and crossed characters, but it is fun to watch. Some good 70's music going on here, some fun stereotypes of the disco era, but it is never mean or overly campy. It just is what it is and that's not such a bad thing. A good nostalgic rainy day/Sunday movie."
4,THOSE DISCO DAYS,"This is a fun movie, every bit as relevant as Saturday Night Fever in depicting the disco generation. Unfortunately the music here is not as good as in SNF's gripping soundtrack. Donna Summer is excellent as the aspiring singer getting her big break. Enough funny scenes hold the attention and it's perhaps a less sanitized view of the disco era than Saturday Night Fever, what with a transvestite shaving his beard in the men's and stuff like that. The actual disco here is much more impressive than in the other movie. Still worth a laugh or two."
3,Donna Summer was the real star of this movie.,"It was a terrible vehicle for Donna Summer to join the musical movies genre of the late 70s (Saturday Night Fever, Grease, Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, to mention a few), but her unsurpassed musical talent alone was sufficient for her self-redemption and entitled her to a permanent place in 20th century popular music history. Let's not forget, too, that she saved the record label Casablanca from oblivion. Her ""Last Dance"" is the definitive disco anthem."
2,"Humorous in some parts, painful in others.","Made to cash in on the success of ""Saturday Night Fever,"" TGIF lacks ""Fever's"" charm and fleshed out characters. Fans of the band Berlin will enjoy seeing lead singer Terri Nunn in the role of Jeannie."
4,Donna Summer is a star!,"If you want to know what the 70,s were like buy this dvd. Donna Summer is the star of the movie, and aptlyso. She will live forever."
3,Thank God It's Friday.,"Thank God It's Friday:I was surprised I thought it was a funny movie, ""You D**n Right your Sorry""-The short Garbage man, and Donna Summer ,I like her,it's not as corny of a movie AS I thought it would be."
3,What about the Commodores?,"So far only one other reviewer has mentioned the presence of the Commodores. They figure into one of the story lines, and also do a complete number in the dance contest segment (Too Hot to Trot). For those whose musical taste ventures beyond what they think is cool to mention in their blogs, that number alone is worth the price of admission.As for the prior comment that went ""Among varying degrees of human stupidity, imagination can barely contemplate an extent percievably unattainable by even the most intellectually impaired homosapiens."", I would say the same about the movie 'American Beauty', which said reviewer probably thought was groundbreaking."
4,Memories,I enjoyed this movie as it took me back to my post high school days. The free for all attitudes have certainly wrecked havoc on our morals of today but I still had a good time.
2,An embarrassment...for all...,"I was a bartender in a very popular disco in Milwaukee in 1979. There is nothing in ""TGIF"" that remotely resembles anything I've encountered. TGIF is, simply, a crashing bore, putting into consideration how dated it might be. Debra Winger's film debut was a bright spot, and Donna Summer's singing of the Oscar winning ""Last Dance"" was certainly fine, but the studio's idiot idea to cash in on the disco craze was ill-thought and without any redeeming qualities. Acting was generally vapid, and Jeff Goldblum was more obnoxious than usual. There simply seemed to be no sense of self-respect among any of the characters, except for Winger & Summer. In retrospect, the whole disco-craze was an embarrassment for those who attempted to be cool. Being cool is not something you can manufacture: you either are or you ain't. No character in this film was a candidate."
3,I went to see this movie for Donna Summer's performance only,"When I saw this movie in 1978, when I was 13, everybody wanted to see this movie for one reason: Because Donna Summer was singing ""Last Dance,"" and at the time, ""Last Dance"" was the hottest song in the country. So people flocked to the Fox Theater to see Donna Summer's performance. Everybody knew back then that the movie itself wasn't great. I remember hardly anybody laughed during the movie. Everybody was waiting to see Donna Summer. I enjoyed the movie, if you are looking for sidesplitting humor, look elsewhere. The jokes are okay, but nothing to write home about. The music is hot, though."
2,average film good music,the film was average at best.trying to cash in on the Saturday night fever success this film is hit&miss at best.but the music is good.Donna Summers saves the day and the film.
2,Love Boat type soap in disco version,"Issued just after Saturday Night Fever, using 'Friday' in the title...yep, this movie was destined to fail. It did, but what is special to show it or buy it now? First it's the only movie performance of Donna Summer, shining and breathtaking like she always was and still is! Further it can be considered a good documentary about disco, disco music and the feeling of that era. Parties without boundaries, everybody happy and everything possible. Some nice tunes, some nice jokes, nice design, but very seventies and dull. Could be a nice documentary rather then an entertaining movie. But hey, party is a party, so not to be taken too seriously. With that attitude? Then the film is nice to watch, and the perfect video wallpaper for a seventies disco party :-)"
1,B-A-D and not in a good way,"Hindsight is 20 20. When I was a young teenager and CHiPs and Charlie's Angels were actually part of the regular season on the networks, I accepted them as good television. To watch them now is painful (CHiPS) and nostalgic (Charlie's Angels - after all those women are gorgeous!). However, that still doesn't make them good.Thank God It's Friday is bad in the same way those television shows are bad. In fact, the script and the film are more in line with what television shows were than what films were. It's cheap and silly and amateurish. The acting is terrible and the story is nonsense.The running gags are worthy of One Day at A Time television show and nothing more.Really, don't bother."
1,Avoid like the plague,"Among varying degrees of human stupidity, imagination can barely contemplate an extent percievably unattainable by even the most intellectually impaired homosapiens. Thus, it is sad to note that such idiocy does in fact exist in full-blown cinematic form, and ""Thank God It's Friday"" is its name. This wretched abomination compiles heap upon heap of repulsive, finger-in-throat slapstick in one of the worst movies ever conceived. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is another story altogether, comprising a respectable repertoire of such gems as Thelma Houston's ""Love Masterpiece"" and Sunshine's ""Take It Too The Zoo"", which in contrast to quality of the movie can be summarized as bitterly ironic. So, by all means, get the soundtrack (preferably the 2-CD version) and blare it to your heart's content. But, whatever you do, stay as far away from this film as possible."
4,Thanks God it is Friday,"It is a good memory of the Disco era. Good Donna Summer's debute in the movie, even if this is not her very best."
4,TGIF,I remember watching this movie when I was a kid.....It's now a blast from the past and I loved every minute of it...bad acting and all.
4,DVD of this wanted,This is a classic filmColumbia / Tristar - Please can we have a DVD release of this great movie
4,classic,classic movie- time capsule of the disco eraDonna Summer must have had this written around her.rip Mrs Summer
4,the 2nd greatest disco movie,"this is a crazy comedy, with nonsense & ridiculous, but donna summer is spectacular in her last dance perforfance. commodores with lionel ritchie singin & playing sax, the dance of the leatherman. i can't stand paul jabara. i can't believe he dared to go into a recording carreer after this. i have one of his albums, with 2 songs duet with donna summer & they are no better than disco duck. watch it, is gonna be 90 minutes of crazy 70's style fun, because some of the jokes are dated, & a lot of casablanca & motown disco music in the background."
3,Cheesy but great music,I had forgotten how cheesy and badly acted this movie was. Can't believe I went to see it several times at the cinema when I was young.Great memories... Donna Summer at her best and the Commodores were incredible too.
3,Lovely Donna,"It had to be the counterpart for SNF, but didnt have the impact. Great are the performances of the Commodores and off course the one and only Diva Donna Summer. Great cult film, with a lot of alltime dance classics!!"
3,anybody else missing casual sex & drugs?,"one of those movies that is just a guilty pleasure. i KNOW its not very good, but the casual sex and drug use is a hoot to watch these days -- kinda like a very inferior episode of the original ""saturday night live"". i rented this out of my compulsion to see EVERY movie to win an oscar (herein ""the last dance"") and while i wouldnt care to see it again for a long time, it might be fun to watch anew in 20 years."
1,a poor book for undergraduate and graduate students,this book does not fit into an undergraduate program. it is much to detailed and quite boring for the undergraduate and most graduate students. this book has content but no deliverance for the masses to comprehend.it is a good resource book but a poor text book for the university undergraduate or graduate. jemery
3,OK... not the greatest quality,"This is just OK. The pegs don't fit snuggly enough so the easily come out as you are taking disks off when you solve the puzzle. This can really break your rhythm and cause you to loose track of the solution. Some of the disks' holes are not centered so they do not stack symmetrically. This can make it seem that you have disks out of sequence.Despite the somewhat poor construction quality, we have fun with it. My 8 year old kids can manage 5 disks (31 moves) without much trouble and they are beginning to see the recursive pattern. Going to 6 disks (61 moves) is a little too much for their attention span. They loose their place and interest, but it has given them a good sense of the exponential growth in the the solution. I can envision adding disks incrementally to maintain the challenge, but I'm not sure any of us would have the patience for all 8 disks (minimum of 255 moves)."
3,Could be better,"Want to get away from all the internet and hand held computer games? This forces you to ""think"". 255 moves to solve it and it doesn't get any easier the 2nd or 3rd times. I'm disappointed with the workmanship of the game itself. Poor choice of wood; pegs fall out; dull finish. But it's still a mind developing game."
5,AWESOME,"The big L O V E Like a thick fluid viscous full bodied wine fountaining from the depths of my heart, feeding every cell of my body. Is there really anything else?I loved this book. It opened me.Atlantis... ah.. now do I remember? somewhere inside me? Lets do it differently this time. Can we? Please?All once Atlantian masters of science and esoterica, please feel free to announce your current planetary presence via email.Many Blessings all. I love you though you do not know me. I can not help it."
2,No GUI Interface,"The product would seem to work well, however, there is no GUI interface like most similar products. You must telnet into a text based interface. Again, this is not in and of itself a bad thing but, for example, AT&T has no idea how to configure it because all their info is for GUI interface products."
2,mac doc is for OS 9!,"I was seriously considering this modem but prior comments about it not having a GUI interface for configuration sent me to the Netopia (""a Motorola company"") website to read the actual product manual. Kudos to Netopia for making it fairly quick and easy to find this PDF file.No kudos for its content, however. Having all Macs, naturally I turned to the section on Configuring TCP/IP in Macintosh computers and was absolutely gob-smacked to find it quite detailed with screen shots -- for Mac OS 9! You remember OS 9? The one that was last released in 2001? The one for which upward compatibility was finally dropped when Apple went to Intel processors in 2005, SIX YEARS AGO???I'm sorry, but seriously? You haven't been able to update the manual in this decade?No sale."
2,painful,"Seemed like a good price at first, but then exceedingly slow shipment, incomparably horrible communications. And the back of the router was coated with dust - this was NOT a new piece of equipment... I would never buy from them again."
2,toy chest,"My daughter-in-law wanted this for my granddaughter's first birthday so I ordered it. Can't say I'm happy with it as it is too small to be of much real use for storing toys but it does hold most of her stuffed animals. I personally would rather have liked to make a toy chest for her but she insisted on this one.It was easy to assemble and the parts all fit together nicely. The top is lightweight which is good because it comes completely off and is not attached by safety hinges found on most kids' furniture. A very small child could get their fingers caught under the lid but hopefully without too much injury because it is so light. My granddaughter figured the lid out at age 1 so it can be done.If the toddler in your life likes polka dotted ponies, this may just be the toy chest for you, but be sure you'll be satisfied with the small size."
2,"cute, but don't worth the money.","I agree with the previous reviewers that this horse toy chest looks very cute. But cuteness isn't everything.1. Too small, much smaller than it looks in the picture. Beware of the length 29"", it includes the length of horse head.2. The boards of the toy chest were too thin and too soft. Shabby looking, I won't even let my toddler sit on it in fear of breaking it apart. The horse head board is the only piece that looks sturdy.3. The instruction of installation not helpful. I don't understand why it needs screws in two different length. The longer one only increased the difficulty of screwing in. It took me some time to figure out the direction and position of each board. And some of them are exchangeable.4. The cover and the box are not connected by hinge. In some sense, it is not convenient."
5,At Last!,"Usually, when I hear people speak about God or higher power, I glaze over. Most books onspirituality I just flip through and can't get interested. I started to read this book and the voiceis clear. When I got to the explanation for LIFE as a Loving Infinite Force of Energy, I kept goingback to this phrase and I understood that and could relate to that. I found myself reading thiis book page by page and then going back to certain parts and rereading them. Always the voice is clear and unpreachy.I feel like a traveler on the beginning of a new journey."
4,Forgotten classic,"This is really a forgotten treasure. Nasby (David Locke) was one of the foremost white exponenents of racial equality in the 1860s-1880s. As A ""Radical Republican"" he naturally hated the ""Democratic"" Irish. BUT in this journey to Europe he finds all the reasons of his time to attack the oppressors of poor people EVERYWHERE. Even --especially in Ireland. The book is very well written and reads easily, but above all for any Irishman who has forgotten the absolute core identity of his or her heritage with that of Black Americans, Nasby is the best corrective. Here is the best of the honest common sense of the 19th century. It can add much to understanding in the 21st."
2,Not Quite as advertized,"The second half of the book was good, but a large number of earlier pages had marker and pen marks/drawings/answers on them. The description did not state that it had writing in it, though it probably should have. The other half of the book was unused."
3,macro program issue,"The URC 8820 works as advertised. However, I bought it for its macro capability and found that it did not work well with my TV/DVD setup. The major problem is the long time my TV (Panasonic 42"" plasma HDTV less than one year old) needs to boot up when turned on and it misses all the signal from the URC 8820 macro. I looked everywhere to see if the URC 8820 can be programmed with a 3 second pause before continuing with the macro and could not find any. To make use its macro capability, make sure all your electronic equipments can receive rapid remote signals from the URC 8820. There may be problem if the newer model TV needs longer time to boot before it can receive more remote signals.As a work around I have to program two buttons to do what I intended to do and press the second button (e.g., to change the signal source from cable box to DVD player etc.) when my TV is ready."
5,Excellent Replacement Remote,"Had just about given up finding a replacement remote for my Samsung DVD player. Even Samsung indicated it was no longer available. This product is great, economical to purchase, easy to program, and also now controls all my audio and video components. Very user-friendly. Highly recommended."
5,Works great!,"I was able to program almost all of my A/V equipment into the unit with a simple code. It was somewhat tedious to manually enter our Sony DVR, because I couldn't find the code for it. The two macro buttons are nice, but more would be better."
5,Great for Tivo Users,"I bought this remote because it was the most similar to the Tivo remote I have. It's great for Tivo and I also use it for my DVD player. You do have to get a little creative with some of the buttons (Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down, Subtitles for DVD, etc.). High quality product, definitely recommended."
1,Non-existent customer support. One for None (not me anyways),"Bought this here on Amazon. Could not find a code for my DVR. Tried ones listed in the tables. Tried searching using ALL device types. Tried (twice) to contact OFA for help/upgrade as documented in the manual. Got zero response/ack. NADA! Useless to me. Returned for refund. Also found a couple of documented ""features"" that did not exist/work, but was able to work around with learning function. Will not ever deal with companies with no CS."
3,"It's a fine product, but","It was working fine with only TV or only DVD as a single remocon. However, it was not working with TV and DVD at the same time, which was my original intention to buy an universal remocon..."
2,Almost Great,"I originally gave this product a five star review. However, this update is now rating this universal remote at only two stars because of the defects in workmanship. The ""sat"" button started to stick and a few months afterward, the unit failed completely. Although this unit is fairly easy to use and program, the mere fact that it doesn't last very long is a definite negative for this unit.If you are looking for an easy to use replacement remote, this one can do the job. But you should be cautious as the quality of materials may not be able to take normal, daily use.Because of its short lifespan, I cannot whole-heatedly recommend this product."
4,just right,This remote is an amazing value. Believe it or not it is the only one I have found that meets my rather minimal programability needs and does it at a great price. Its layout is perfect and intuitive. It's inexpensive enough that I have bought one for each TV/cable box/DVD setup in the house keeping operation consistant for the family members. The only negative is the heavily used buttons wear out after 1-2 years of operation. But at the price that's not a big deal. I hope they keep making this one a long time.
4,"Does as it claims, mostly","Has a very good coverage of devices; could have a couple more buttons; main complaint is very small print, lack of backlight, and too many identical-looking buttons."
4,Know Every words used in Textiles,"This is a great unique book for all textile related persons, it gives in details the perfect meaning of all the words used in todays textile field. I think this book is must for all textile related persons."
1,I would not recommend this product to anyone who enjoy the hobby..,"Where do I start with this filter. I was so excited when I bought this filter but my excitement quickly turned to a nightmare.I would say it worked for the first two weeks then it developed a loud humming noise that was so annoying you could hear it throughout my entire house. So I decided to to restart the filter thinking that there might be some air trapped in the canister that's when the nightmare began. I did everything exactly how the manual instructed but the primer button got stuck and I couldn't restart the system. I called the dealer which I bought this ""Big Al's online"" I am now waiting almost two days for them to contact me via email with an invoice number to do a return throughout this time my aquarium is without a filter and I'm here praying my fish don't die from swimming in filth. So disgusted right now with this process I would never buy anything from this company again.....!!"
4,ML Pump,"This is a pretty good pump, kept my 26 gal reef tank looking good, no problems with flow. The only complaint I have is the seal can be a little tricky once you put the pump back together after cleaning it. All in all a good purchase and I would recommend to a friend. Also, Marineland is an excellent company that I have used for years."
4,Excellent filter but take care when assembling,"This is an excellent filter with a couple of issues.Pluses: Pump is circulating approximately 530 gal an hour, good for a large cannister filter. Trays in filter can accomodate not only a large amount but a wide variety of mechanical and biological media.Negatives: Top of filter must be sealed to bottom half of filter. Be careful that gasket attached to top portion of filter is not damaged when seating top half to bottom half. If it is damaged, it will leak water. The other issue is air locks. Filter has a hand pump to expell air locks but this is for small air purges only. Be sure filter is full of water before attempting to pump out air locks."
2,C530 has design flaws,the motor head is a pain to get off. Broke a couple of parts just trying to unseal motor from canister. I could not stand this which lead to the purchase of a Fluval FX-5 and I've never regretted buying it 2 years ago.
1,should have been straight to video,"The movie was poorly written. Very uneven. Barely anything happens then at the end there are all these twists that go no where. Horrible dialogue. How many times can the 'F' word be used? Maybe it was meant to be used as a drinking game? 'Chug when someone says 'F#$&!' Bizarre ending that just left me in a state of 'HUH?' A more lucid plot would have been nice. Good extras though, otherwise a completely non scary and dim witted horror movie. You're better off with the original Friday the 13th."
1,Don't even bother...,"I couldn't believe how awful I thought this movie was! I laughed through it, as they go through the typical 'teenagers in the woods' horror film scenarios over and over again. The special effects are nothing to write home about, either! Save your money and watch a good thriller, like SEVEN! :-)"
1,I'm feeling ill,"My newest DVD player allows me to watch a movie at the 1.5 speed and still hear the dialogue. With a movie like this, that is a must-have extra. It saved me from wasting more time on this piece of toxic medical waste."
1,The movie we've all been waiting for?,"When I heard all the ravings on this movie ('this is the one we've all been waiting for'!, etc.) I just had to see it, well, being a big fan of horror movies and everything. I was so mad at this piece of garbage! No, wait. I'm mad at the director for even MAKING this piece of garbage!! What the hell was up with all the loads of comedy?! And the end? What was up with that? And the Bowling Alley Massacre? SO STUPID!! And above all: WHERE IN THE HELL DID THE DISEASE COME FROM??!! I've never seen such a big plothole! Man, ""Dreamcatcher"" was better than ""Cabin Fever"" and I hated that one! At least they told you where THAT disease came from!So please, I urge you strongly: PASS THIS ONE BY. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME unless you feel you need to add ""Cabin Fever"" to your ""Movies I've Seen"" list.If you want to see a 'classic-type' horror picture, watch ""Wrong Turn"", ""Resident Evil"" or ""Ginger Snaps."""
3,Student film with top techniques,"I watched it on rented DVD, and I thought it WAS worth $3. This movie is more like an old B-rank horror. There are some funny moments, but overall it's kinda boring. Not scary at all ( except; the leg shaving scene was good). There isn't much story to it, or it rather looks like a beginning of a much bigger story, and the kids are so stupid ( as usual as in any other horror movies).The directer did this as his hobbie.I bet it was more fun to make this movie than to watch it.A student film with top techniques. That's how I see it.The featured short wax cartoon about the rotten fruits is pretty good."
1,Another one for immature viewers...,"I am disgusted by so much bull... How can someone waste money making a flick like that? I should get paid watching it! Always thought it might get better during the movie, but I finally turned it off after getting tired of hearing the ""F""-word every two seconds and seeing dumb kids running around promoting drugs, senseless slashings and cheap sex scenes. A movie only for braindeads! Watch out!"
1,Simply one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen...,...Definetley the grossest. So I guess that counts for something. This movie is truly disgusting. So if that's what you're into then you'll ptobably really like this movie. Other than the gross out factor there's really not much more to this movie. So there's really no need to spend anymore time on this review.
2,Cabin Fever (**),"I agreed to watch this film with a friend after he said it was a pretty good movie. I had already rented it before and got through the first half of the film before shutting it off. So, I went ahead and watched it again. It's an O.K. movie, but is so cliched that you can tell in which order everyone of them will die in (except for the ending, you can't really predict that). The gore isn't really amazing, or gross out, (not as guesome as the critics said) and the story just wants to drag on and on and on (well you get the picture). The cast is pretty terrible with the exception of the two characters from ""Detroit Rock City"" (James DeBello and Giuseppe Andrews). The script has so many holes in it, that it truly is pathedic. I've seen cheesy horror films, but they atleast tried to be cheezy/funny, this is neither. If you're looking for a good horror movie that just came out, check out the movies ""Wrong Turn"" and ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" and save your money and time from this dud."
2,"OK- WHAT""S UP WITH THIS","Ok- the movie was ok- but gross to say the least. I wasn't scared, but I walked out of the movie feeling like I was going to puke!!! Anyway- I am a big Boys Meets World fan and the ending was frankly disappointing (see the movie and you will understand) anyway- i would recommend this movie only to those individuals that are craving sick, gross, graphic and bloody effects- not someone who is hoping to be scared or scare someone else"
1,that is too many,"I had a freind who bought this the day it came out and advised me to do the same. I almost bought it thank god I saw it at blockbuster and rented it. Had I bought this highschool like ametuer horror film I would have been out 20 bucks. I would have not even sold it because I would not want to subject anyone to this dull fake and insanely bad so called horror flick. Why is peter Jackson endorsing this, He must have given eli roth a couple hundered bucks to get this garbage made. stay away, you have been warned."
1,worst movie ever!,"we went to go see this at the movies....and we almost left less than halfway through.this movie has a great plot and storyline, but the whole thing is about sex...and i mean the whole thing! which is fine except its not in this movie....olny see this if you have seen every other movie."
2,OK........I Guess.,"Cabin Fever was more of a funny movie then a horror. Though the characters in it did great jobs acting. The movie was just do much of a dumb joke, then it was of a real movie. I bet that the people who directed it where just bored and did this movie for fun. I am giving this movie two stars because I enjoyed it, to a certain degree. If you are looking for a horror movie look some where else. If you are looking for a funny movie, and blood and gore dosn't grose you out you might want to rent it."
4,You Got TO Be Crazy ...This is a good movie,"I never had to defend one movie more than this one. I know alot of people that dispise this movie for what reason I dont know. This is a good movie. Its not like that boring 28 days later. This movie has it all. Especially when the girl realizes they are all going to die. So what does she do she decides to ""enjoy"" herself with that geek from Boy Meets World (now they could have done without him). Thats how you go out. But more than that this is a good movie for a low budget one."
1,Bad from start to finish,"Horrilble in every way possible. If you like good films - don't do it. If you like B-films, so bad they're good- still don't do it! Shame on this film."
2,Not too great...,"Cabin Fever...it most definitely was NOT good...The movie had no true plot I noticed. I understand that I am here to review Cabin Fever, but just to give you an example - a horror movie that had an awesome plot that I loved right away was ""The Ring"". So what if it had barely any blood and gore in it? They had a cool story that left you stuck to your seat. It seems that this movie just tried to focus on how disgusting they could get...The film literally did NOT have a story barely at ALL...so I got bored of it very quickly. All the actors did amazing jobs, I just couldn't find myself to enjoy it.If you love movies with blood and gore in it - by all means - BUY THIS MOVIE. But if you would rather have a story with a plot and purpose, move as far away from this place and never come back!! =P"
2,Don't waste your time or money!,"This is movie is slower than molasses. The plot line is never explained. We don't know where the bacteria came from, how it got started(except that the dog gave it to it's master). I spent $7.50 at the movies for this trash and believe me I wanted my money back in the end. So, please don't waste your time. This is worse than any ""B"" movie I've ever seen. The Blob is better than this movie."
1,has a couple redeeming qualities,"I enjoyed the blonde guy getting shot up, and when the dog ate the brunette I liked that too. Basically when the kids got killed was when I got happy, because they were so annoying! The flesh eating virus was quite sick; I really hate movies that focus on skin lesions because it just looks so painful. I also hate movies where the creators have no sense of humor, because this movie failed miserably in the black humor department. It would've worked better if released in the 80s, because that's about what it looks like, a poorly made 80s film. Seriously, the outdoor lighting makes it look like its 20 years old, I guess they couldn't afford enough lights to aviod high speed film grain. Also this movie keeps going on and on.. the suspense will be you guessing when it will finally end. All and all, for the budget (1.5 million?) I could do much much better."
1,STUPID TEENS DIE DUE TO STUPIDITY,"Yes, it's true, a bunch or collegy types get together and thank goodness they are dead by the end of the flick cuz they are wretchedly annoying. Their stupidity knows no bounds everything they say should be captured in a vacuum and ejected in outer space to torment the aliens.The gore is good but the movie is torture...absolute torture.Please...lord please can't they make a horror film where at least one character has a personality?"
5,The funniest thing ever!,"I will agree with most people. This movie was absolutely dismal! But, if you want to laugh like crazy, than you have to buy this. Nothing is more fun than sitting around and making fun of how bad something is. The pancakes scene is so hilarious you won't stop laughing for hours. It was completely randomn. I have seen many movies and many randomn things, but this scene is defintely at the top of the listThis movie could brighten your day with all its horribleness"
1,Pathetic......,"One of the stupidest horror flicks I've ever seen. I know there are plenty out there.This is not a movie about monsters or anything scary like that. Rather it's about a virus that infects and kills people. They try to put in a blair witch project kind of effect throughout the movie. The sense of hopelessness. But the terrible acting of the cast can easily drive you away.You are forced to follow 5 college students, self absorbed, moronic characters who think of only sex and pot, which seems to be the general trend in these low budget horror flicks.There isn't much of a story here. Throw in some blood here and there and you call it horror. And whats up with the biting kid who does this crazy kungfu thing. It was the most ridiculous scene I have ever seen.Don't even bother watching this movie. It's an absolute waste of time."
4,Laughing and Nauseated all at once!,"I didn't expect this movie to be good. When I rented it I thought it would be just another run of the mill B movie that would give me a scare or two if I was lucky, and then I would forget it, but I was very happily surprised.The movie does start out with the pre-requsite teens going into to the woods to party at an isolated cabin, and there is some unexplainable disease, no surprises there, but after the movie gets going and the characters begin to develop their little quirks the story is both disgusting and hilarious.I did get scared a couple of times, and I definitely got creeped out by the disease stuff. The part with the girl shaving her legs really makes me happy I have an electric shaver...ewwwww!The townfolk hillbillies are great, especially little Dennis and the store owner.It is the smart, unexpected humor and character development that pull this movie out of the crowd.PANCAKES!!! *lol*"
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This movie is awful. It might be the worst movie let alone horror movie I have ever seen. The plot is not very interesting or scary, and the fever, that everyone is getting, is not explained in regards to how it came to be. The acting is bad, and watching a ten year old boy, who seems to be handicapped, jump in the air and do ""matrix-styled kicks"" before a bites someone is abosolutely rediculous."
3,LEG SHAVER,"CABIN FEVER had its moments, and director/writer Eli Roth definitely shows the influence of such films as THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE and LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. But..*Where did the virus come from?*What was it with the biting kid and the pancake kung fu?*Why did every other word have to be the F word; writers think it's cool..it just shows how void they are of any creative dialogue.*Why do they always portray rural people as ignorant rednecks and beer guzzling fools?*Why did they cast people like Joey Kern who couldn't act his way out of a strait jacket?But, the biggest bonus of this film is the beautiful love them written by the wonderful Angelo Badalamenti (TWIN PEAKS). It's gorgeous and provides the film's biggest shock as Rider Strong plays touchy feely with Jordan Ladd.Rent, don't buy, unless you really want the love theme!"
2,Pancakes!,"So last night I watched Cabin Fever, and I think my life is the smaller for it. The movie is a pretty lame paean to the horror genre, with nods to such films as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Evil Dead, Cujo, The Stand, and plenty more. All the clichés are present, with sex equalling gory death, teens making foolish decisions, and rednecks going on rampages.The movie supposed to be a dark comedy, but I didn't find it to be terribly funny. There were a couple of parts that did get me, though. The kid that plays Dennis, the boy who bites, rocks out. In the DVD extras, he really shows his stuff when he does a highly energetic, head-banging, kung fu staff-handling routine. The DVD is worth watching for this scene alone.Literally.I wouldn't bother watching the movie itself--just the Dennis ""pancakes"" scene."
2,Not The Greatest,"Well lets see.. It didn't make much sense, it got really confusing, and it wasn't scary! There was a good plot line untill about the last 30 mins it started to get confusing! And having characters in the movie that you only see once, whats up with that? like who are they? What do they have to do with the plot? and where did they come from? they're just there!I suggest that you rent this or wait for it to come on TV before buying it, watch it for yourself!"
5,Something entertaining for a change.,"I would ignore all of the morons who expect way too much out of movies these days, and realise the movie was made in a way that Evil Dead was; Gross effects, a little horror, some laughs, and all fun. I usually can't stand the special features but I actually sat down like a vegtable to watch them all. The rotten fruit thing was wierd, but hilarious. If I were any of you, I would quit acting like a puppet and at least rent it to find out for yourself. I did, and I'll be ordering it right after this review."
1,This movie a wase of time,"THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE!!!! If I could give it no stars I would. All this movie does is rip off tid-bits from other movies and mashes them together into a complete waste of time. I should have thought a movie with the guy from ""Boy Meets World"" was going to suck.Don't waste brain cells on this movie!!!!!"
1,Not the Best -- Think Before you Buy,"I have to say that after hearing all of my friends and coworkers talking about this movie I just had to see it. So one weekend I rented this and sat down for what I hoped would be a scare fest. I was wrong. The plot of the movie is a skin eating disease that vacationing teens catch after coming into contact with and killing the man who caught it first. They all turn on each other and try to keep whoever has the disease at the time away from the others. The townspeople try to keep it quiet and set out to kill the teens. I did not like this movie, I did not get scared watching this movie, and the special effects are not special nor is the acting. If you are thinking of buying this movie, don't, at least not before you have rented it to see what you are thinking of buying."
3,Don't judge by part 1 - take it on it's own merits...,"Apparently, everybody here is knocking this because of it's title.I know this movie went through some major post-production overhauls (like the new ""The Wolfman"" - and that sucked); but, for what it is - there's a legitimate indie feeling to it I don't usually get from a studio released film (even straight to video).Maybe credit it to Ti West?Either way, worth a look. I enjoyed it - and took it for what it was. If you compare it to part one - you'll be disappointed. It not - you may enjoy it.A 3/5 - maybe rent before you buy (unless it's cheap?)"
2,BLOODIEST PROM SINCE CARRIE,"...but nowhere as good a film. The best thing about this is the clever animation opening and ending. Rider Strong gets top billing and was only in the quick opening. All the students look 25 or older, and most of them can't act. There is so much gore that it becomes comical. The ending comes too quickly without any real resolution, although another sequel wouldn't surprise me..and the peeing in the punchbowl just over the top! No wonder so many remakes are Hollywood's thing now!"
3,"Not great, not bad","This was one I caught on cable. It was amusing enough, but don't have really high expectations. The acting and production values are decent and the plot was able to keep my interest."
4,It's a good movie,"The first time i saw this movie was on sci-fi. It was good. Not great, not my favorite, but good. This is a movie i would bring to a friends slumber party. It didn't make me laugh, it didn't make me scream but on some occasions it made me look away. There is a good share of gore that i think the movie needed at times. The kid that bit the guys hand was a little odd and i don't think the movie needed it but it's not like they can go back a change it. i personally didn't like the ending but i heard they were coming out with a 2nd one and Rider Strong[...]is going to be in that one too.i don't think that the movie needed a second one but neither did a nightmare on elm street(and they made 6!)anyways, it's a good movie and i would recommend renting it for a long weekend."
1,utter crap,"i thought this movie was one of the worst things I have ever rented. I wished they had all died sooner.Boring, witless and mind-numbingly stupid.Who cares....?"
2,OKAY IT SUCKS,"The movie is bad. But you must admit the boy flipping and then saying pancakes makes the film. Its a wonder how bad movies get made but it is pure comedy. It is the trapped in the closet of Horror films but I'm going to target now to buy it. Consumerism is crazy. It sucks but its worth a look. it really is bad, but the biting boy is what sells me."
1,Terribly Horrible,"First of all, I bought the used DVD for like 4.99. The movie was crazy, the characters were so stupid. Honestly, when you watch a movie, especially a thriller or horror movie, you are always saying to yourself what you would do in that situation. Everything I would have done in just about every scene was the complete opposite of what they did in the movie. Metophoricallly speaking, the Artificial intelligence of the characters in the movie was very very low. And the ending. The ending was so stupid. This movie will never sit in my DVD player again. I would have traded it in had it not been for the DVD case that did not come with it. Overall , GARBAGE!!!!"
1,Below-average mess is a rip-off of EVIL DEAD,"Cabin Fever is a confusing and very stupid mess of a movie that tries to be the Evil Dead of the 00s and fails. The poorly written plot and storyline deals with five friends at a cabin and that night a hobo-like woodsman gets a flesh-eating disease and effects all making all five flesh being eaten.What really messes this up is the plotThe plot's problems:1.Why did that policeman like to party and didn't care about the law.His role was badly written2.Why was that kid biting the teen for after saying ""Pancakes,Pancakes"" and then his father blamed the teen for infecting the kid when the father saw the kid bite him.3.The last weird part was when the last teen visits the party held in the woods with all those people and then he starts puking blood and blood spills everywhere but how did the cop not get infected.Skip this trash and rent EVIL DEAD 1 or 2. Cabin Fever should be retitled CABIN SLEEPER."
1,Horror? More like a pantomime!,"True, it's not scary at all. The gore is pretty tame. And the humour..... not really that funny.Why? Because for me the moment the teenagers come on screen I had a passionate dislike for them and was praying for them to meet a horrible and painful death! None of them were likable, even the cutesy blonde girl didn't even have a backbone to stand up to the boy-thug, she was so wet it was good to see her waste away.Come on! Intelligent writing can be funny too!So a waste of money. Don't rent it and for god's sake, don't buy it!"
4,No Problem Here,"This is an ""Original,"" inventive, and well done movie. To each their own, I highly recommend it. Funny as well. This DVD has a good amount of special features and some funny ones too."
1,Are you kidding?!,"Who in their right state of mind could possibly like this movie?! In it's attempt at humor it laughs at itself. I certainly wasn't laughing. I really feel sorry for the director of this film. He doesn't realize his own short comings if he thinks he made a hit here. And the ending with the black teenagers showing up was possible the worst, most stupidiest scene in movie history.This movie's not even good enough to use as a book end. Don't, for the love of all things sacred, buy this garbage!"
1,A waste of 90 minutes,"If you like by-the-book horror films, then you'll like this. The movie follows other films by the book and is stupid. It's gory sure, but it doesnt make it good. There's nothing that set's this out among a flood of teen flicks that've come out during the past few years. To call CF mediocre, is being kind."
1,crud,"Not scary, not funny, not suspenseful, not fresh, not original. Complete and utter pile of trash. I don't know how anyone could be scared of such a ridiculous attempt at a film. Shows what garbage is produced when you cater to the lowest common denominator of film audiences (Americans)."
1,Isn't it ironic...,"...how a movie called ""Cabin Fever"" can make you want to desperately flee your own home or the movie theater or even an airplane if this movie's playing on it. Awful."
1,"0 STARS: Oh, I am so scared of this movie. LOL","The movie ""Cabin Fever"" is hardly even worth a horror movie review, but if it will save some smart people's money out there, I guess I will just have to do it. The plot of this movie is simple yet extremely stupid. A group of 20 somethings go out to some cabin to go camping and there is some sort of bacteria contamination in the water source nearby. The characters drink the water and their flesh starts to rot and rip off and they supposedly go crazy, but not very convincingly. That's it...plenty of gore signifying absolutely nothing. The directing and acting are both horrible. This movie is crap, rubbish and sludge. DO NOT waste your money on this total ZERO of a flick as there are simply no redeeming qualities in this so-called ""horror movie"". In short, ""Cabin Fever"" is just plain AWFUL and a TOTAL WASTE of time!! The only thing horrifying about this movie is how pathetic and sad the movie is as a horror flick."
3,Don't go into the woods,"Clever title aside, this is just a generic horror flick based on a worn weary plot device: isolate a group of people, no phone, and down they go one at a time. Big deal. Except, this time out it's not a crazed lunatic after them, it's a disease. There is something visceral, almost primal, about the fear of disease. Who likes to be coughed on or at? And as this is a very visible disease, it's no surprise that the 'friends' soon turn on each other. That's the horror. However, it would have been far more effective if any or all of these people were likable to begin with. When you don't care what happens to them, or worse, hope it happens sooner rather than later...But the oddest thing about this movie is that everyone, including the dog, has anger issues. What's up with that?Eh, didn't hate it, didn't like it. It is what it is."
2,"Not the worst, but not good","The cover of this movie features a glowing review from Peter Jackson, which is what motivated me to rent it. I love Peter Jackson's work. I just wish his taste in movies was as good. Like a lot of others have commented the characters in this movie are people you have great difficulty in liking. Seeing them die becomes a relief since for most of the film you want to kill them yourself. The extra star I'm giving it is for the story concept. Rather than just taking the easy way out and doing something familiar, Roth came up with flesh eating bacteria. I thought that was a fairly original notion, though it failed in execusion."
4,Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes!!!,"Poor Dennis. He was more than slightly retarded. But as with many of the mentally challenged, he could see into the future. He knew that by biting down on Bert's infected flesh, it would somehow lead him to the tasty pancakes which he so desired.No one really understands why Dennis is screaming about pancakes before he leaps off and takes a bite out of Burt, but if you watch carefully when Rider Strong's character is being wheeled through the hospital at the very end, he catches a glimpse of an eerie character in a passing hospital room, dressed as a giant rabbit, serving a heaping plate-full of pancakes to no other than, yes, little Dennis. Aww, one last treat before he rots away on his hospital bed. hahahahaThis movie is great. For Fans of Evil Dead, etc."
1,Random Thoughts on a Crappy Movie,"Cabin Fever 2 is barely a movie. For starters, if you take away the credits, its only about 67 minutes long. It is sad that the worst character from the first film is the best thing about the sequel, (the idiotic cop). There are needless scenes of teen angst that amount to nothing except to pad out the running time. The main lead, who is supposed to be a high school senior is clearly too old for the part, complete with receeding hairline. The ""comedy"" is as sophisticated as listening to a couple of eight year olds make jokes. The gore is weak and boring. The actors and dialouge all suck. The TV movie animated credits sequence is lame. Did the people who made this film actually like the finished product? Avoid this total disaster."
1,Huge waste of time and money,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. About half way through the movie I was ready to turn it off. I'm glad I only wasted a few dollars by renting it, but that was still too much. If you have any standards for plot, acting, believability, ect. you will avoid this mess."
1,Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes!,"OMG, was this stupid. My emotions veered from embarassment all the way over to disbelief as I watched this horrible excuse for a movie. The part that puzzled me most was when the little kid that liked to chomp people suddenly broke out into his best karate moves after excitedly chanting about Pancakes...huh?Skip it. Although, the pancake scene DID make me laugh..."
1,Ooops! that was a stinker,"I don't consider myself a morbid person, but for some strange reason I love all kinds of zombie/disease movies. I watched this movie with very low expectations, but this could be the worst one I've ever seen.I had to go to Amazon out of sheer curiousity just to see what other people had to say about it. I couldn't even laugh at its shortcommings.The idea of the movie is good and it had potential, but I was shocked at how bad it was put together. I would love to know who and how this movie ever got approved.At no point is this movie scary it should not be considered a horror movie. It was almost like the director was trying to dilute the moments that should have been scary on purpose.I guess my only confession is that it was SOOOOOO bad that I will probably end up watching it again. I guess I must be more morbid than I thought..."
1,Terrible film,"This movie was terrible, suffering from an exceedingly poor script, weak acting, zero tension or suspense, and mediocre gore effects. I'm not a person to say that a horror movie should spend alot of time developing characters, but characters should be at least nominally developed so when they get killed off, you feel something about it one way or the other. The only thing I felt about the characters in Cabin Fevor 2 was irritation. In addition, Cabin Fevor 2 lacked any kind of production value polish that might have made up a little for the sub-standard script. Basically, this movie just blatantly exists to part suckers who lived Cabin Fevor 1 from their cash, and that's the only horror to this film."
5,The Best Movie EVER!!!,"You cannot watch this movie at all if you are going to watch it wrong. If you don't like horror movies in general, this is not the one to start with. But if you do, and are willing to go into it expecting a lot, this movie is amazing. It made me scared, and every time something was tense and frightening, something hilarious happened and made my crack up. Rider Strong is the sexiest person alive, so seeing him topless twice is not a bad addition. I watch this movie on a regular basis, I love it so much. A lot of guys think it's a chick movie, but I know a few who really enjoyed it. Defiantly give this movie a chance. And watching the special features makes it all the better."
3,"Excellent Strory, Great Visuals, Very Bad Actings!","this movie had some strong points and a weakness! Story was awsome, although it could be more thrilling. visuals were perfect. and the casting, well, it's half movie weakness and half it's power both! female cast of the movie were excellent, young beautiful and new comer ladies but male cast were terrible with exteremly bad actings, only Winston was good.bad actings affect you from the beginnig which could make you feel that you are watching a cheap teenage horror movie! and you'll need time and patience to find out that it's very good movie suffering a bad production! anyway I bought it cause it's worth for me and I can watch it occasionally, but for you, I can't recommand. it's not a 5 star movie. but I can suggest to everyone to rent it and watch it once"
1,CABIN FEVER - A TORTURE TO WATCH,"I know blurbs on a DVD box are meaningless, but one by Peter Jackson? The Lord Of The Rings himself? I've heard that this movie is a homage to the horror film genre. You have the hot chick, The nice girl, the hot guy, the nice guy, and the dumbass guy. What a homage! This movie is worthless.The extra's include a ""Making Of"" segment which introduces you to the filmaker Eli Roth. This guy comes off sounding like every other dork who had a Super 8 camera as a kid and covered their brother in catsup.There is zero originality in the story line as well as the cinematography. You've seen it all before folks.If you want to see a great movie about a virus, I suggest viewing 28 Days Later. Don't waste your time with film..."
2,Awful,"So this little flick tries to spoof 70's horror eh? Seems more like an Evil Dead ripoff to me. Nothing really ties together, the actors are horrid, the gore sucks, there's no plot or anything.What makes this a good movie? I don't see one good thing. In fact, I'd say this movie might battle it out with Boogeyman as the worst horror flick of 2005.Just awful."
1,big fat disappointment,"After seeing this I really wonder why it was so overhyped in the first place. Instead of running around and selling himself as the new hope for horror films (the guys does four commentarys (!) on that friggin Dvd) Eli Roth should learn to write a decent scripts. At times this thing was so stupid it felt like it was written by some sixteen year old who's making a homemovie trying to copy his favorite horror films. Nothing in this film makes sense, the characters are despisable, everything they say or do is a sign for Roths horrible script. Implausibilties galore and no friggin supense at all. Just throwing buckets of blood around doesnt make a good horror film - Roth should go watch Evil Dead again, there's more to it then just the gore."
2,Its The Party Man,"There is only one good thing in the movie and that is the guy who loves to party you know ""the party guy"". I would watch this movie purely for this guy trust me.Oh yeah and if anyone can explain what the point of those black guys rapping is please tell me"
3,All Hype and Little bite,"Cabin Fever is what you would expect out of a low budget film. Loads of Gore, pointless sex and rednecks.The idea is that a group of friends go out and rent a Cabin in the Woods (wonder where they got that idea). While there a hermit catches some Flesh eating virus and in turn passes it off to the kids. As they start to rott the local hicks get word and go after them. In the end it turns into a violent bloodbath with a vengeful twist in the end.Overall this is a renter. It was hyped by critics loving it and a lot of good word. But overall this is all talk and little bite."
1,Awful sequel,"Anybody that says they liked this movie has to have really low standards. What I can't understand is why Lionsgate would want to have their reputation soiled with this stinker. It is nothing like the original. The original was way more serious. This one does not follow the original's style. It is a bunch of corny humor with out of the top gore. Rider Strong even isn't in this film but for the first 2 minutes when his character gets killed off. He prolly asked to be killed off when he saw the script. Why, did they ruin a good movie this way, I do not know. Hopefully, if a 3rd one is made, they will go back to the original format."
5,Not serious horror,"I first saw this movie on t.v. and I loved it. I had to buy it. For some people this might be just a gross out movie. There's no real horror but lots of blood and if you don't like the idea of something eating you alive then you'd be grossed out. For me though, it wasn't scary at all but damn entertaining. I'd definitly say this is a horror/comedy movie. There are too many jokes and funny moments for it to be taken too seriously. I suppose that's why I enjoyed it. For as cheap as it on here, I'd buy it. It's worth it for many laughs and a few, ""eew"" moments."
4,A scary flick with comic relief,"This movie is funny and scary. Great mix for a horror film. I can't understand why it got so many poor reviews. Honestly, I thought it was one of the best horror movies I had seen in years, and I'm a horror junkie. Don't take my word for it; check it out for yourself."
4,pretty good,this isn't a horror movie. this is definetly a comedy. i laughed allot and it was pretty funny.
3,Cabin Fever about as much fun as a staph infection.........,"I'm being very generous with my 3 star rating.The film starts off just fine. The story is actually genuine and the acting was good IMO. Instead of some psycho killer chasing young men and women it's a water borne pathogen that disentigrates the flesh and once it starts there is no stopping it. I really liked this flick up until the last 20 minutes or so.Apparently the makers of this film couldn't think of an ending so they just kill 'em all off and never explain how this virus began. How very weak and uncreative.To add insult to injury, in an attempt to make the movie watcher forget they didn't know how to end it, they finish it off with a dose of humor. A very sad attempt at humor to boot. Keep in mind this isn't a funny movie.It's too bad. It had a good beginning and solid story throughout but what sticks in my mind the most is the ending, which blew*.*Blew:To spoil or lose through ineptitude."
5,You don't have to be in your 50s...,"... to appreciate this new spin on an old theme. Proof positive that, with imagination, the ""classic"" horror template still delivers, bigtime. The trick is create increasingly compex situations that make the viewer progressively more uncomfortable, but, paradoxically, unable to turn away . The formula goes back, at least, to Night of The Living Dead (probably much earlier, to the early Special Effect masterpieces of the 1930s, Island of Dr. Maureau, etc) and, in the hands of a pro, works just Jim-dandy."
3,retread ending...,"don't believe the hype. the ending is a night of the living dead retread, etc. the acting is nothing to write home about, neither is the direction. the best performance in this flick isdelivered by a truly ferocious dog.look, it's not the worst flick ever made, neither is it the best. fits somewhere in the middle. the principle cast members are so annoyingly belligerent that you'll be glad when they bite the dust.last thing. re: behind the scenes. there is nothing more irksome than actors covered in Karo syrum making grimaces at the camera.please, a little less hype next time & better talent, script and direction. camera and sound were fine.three stars seems fair to me."
2,"""I Love This Movie""",".... I was being sarcastic. Dear God! Why did I even bother watching this at all? What was I expecting? I can't get over how bad it was. Love the gore, but loathe the movie.High School prom is threatened by a flesh-eating virus that spreads through a popular brand of drinking water. I literally felt sick while watching the movie. (If you're a fan of the genre and you feel like talking trash about a movie, this one should definitely go on your list.) Notice how laughable the dialogues are and how badly acted the movie is. I say this movie deserves the 4.4/10 rating it got on imdb.WAIT, THE GORE WAS DEFINITELY A WIN!!!! WIN! WIN!!! WIN!!!"
4,TV generation,"attention-grabbing, off-the-wall good horror with some humor. Redneck in-breeding evident in the local town. Another Steve Miner good effort (if U like his work, try Friday the 13th {ONLY parts 1-3 any good} and also ""House"" starring William Katt)"
1,how can a movie this gory be this boring?,"...by having no characters worth caring about, no discernible plot, and no suspense. This movie makes CABIN FEVER 1 - which also sucked - look like a masterpiece. A completely witless and pointless sequel."
3,Strange,"Chewed apart bodies, stabbings, blood puking, disgusting skin diseases, a body cut in 2, violent and graphic gun shooting and more. Bloody as He*l, not much of good plot.When a group of friends go up to a cabin as a way of celebrating their graduation, they stumble upon a misterious flesh diease that soons starts to kill everyone."
3,Fairly low budget but still a fun movie!,If you're into horror/gore movies then you'll definitely get a kick out of this. It's really got some good comedy and a decent story but don't expect anything high quality when it comes to the production value. It's obvious this films funds were very low but they really made the most out of it.
2,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","Disease is usually good bait for film directors trying to stay original in the horror genre, and there are plenty of good examples of films which depict disease to good results. Cabin Fever starts out just like any slasher flick you used to see in the 80's, a bunch of teens going to stay in the woods. The only problem is they forgot to hire talented teens to play the parts. About a half hour into the movie we started to laugh out loud at just how terrible their performances were. Overall, the movie does have its' moments (especially towards the end) and could make for a decent RENTAL. Do not buy this movie."
1,Bad Sequel No One Asked For,"I saw the first Cabin Fever film and hated it, and this follow up does nothing to redeem the first. It's just more gore for the sake of gore and a collection of totally unlikable characters. Horror films need to have at least one character to root for, usually the hero, but there was no one to care about here. I read the director tried to remove his name from this movie but was unable to do so. I don't blame him. It was just one bad idea after another, and some aspects of the story were introduced but not followed through while others came out of nowhere with no explanation. I'm no big fan of this new genre of horror movie, but this was just plain bad on all levels."
3,The rifle handed over at the end was comical. The movie - blah,"see my title. Slow starting movie, it was o.k. The Orville Redenbacher Natural popcorn was very good."
3,"Gory, and fun too!","I watched Cabin Fever on Video. I thought the movie hadenough blood to satisfy the gross-out movie fans. Also,there was alot of horror movie humor that is typicalof a teenage horror movie. I thought it was somewherebetween 28 days and Wrong Turn in terms of plot and feel.Definitely a film to watch for horror fans."
2,cabin fever,"if u like movies that make no sense and have people puking blood and sores all over their bodies, then this is for u. What was up with the stupid pancake kid and the rabbit in the hospital. gets an extra star cause u get to see a hot girls breasts a couple of times"
1,What an amazing waste of rescources!,I have had more entertaining bowel movements!I think that about sums up my feeling on the acting/plot/storyline of this pathetic piece of filmsmanship. Save your pesos!
5,a horror equation fulfilled! (WON'T SPOIL THE MOVIE),"as a movie man. i appreciate good and bad movies for, well, the good and bad aspects of both.as everyone should know, horror movies are bad. so expecting that, one can pick out great qualities.this movie combines everything a present horror movie should have. a bit dark, pretty gross at times, sexual (and with some wacky things, even for today's teen-audience movies), a whole lot of laughs (the kind that may or may not of been intended, random, and plain old humor), and a bunch of twenty-something mediocre to horrible actors and actresses.very enjoyable."
