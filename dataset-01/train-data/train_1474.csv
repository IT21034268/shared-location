4,has three of NWA's best songs,"although this album may not have much else, it does have three of NWA's best songs, Real niggaz, appetite for destruction, and niggaz 4 life"
2,...Ice Cube took ALOT away when he left.,"Without Ice Cubes lyrical content, NWA felt short into pointless garbage of raping about Killing and rapping woman.This album is no way compared to 'Straight Outta Compton'. The only reason why I gave this a TWO star rating is because 'Real Niggaz' and 'Alwayz into somthin' is okay songs. But most of it is sexist humor about accusing woman of being gold-diggers and giving directions of killing them.If you are a fan of NWA, Dre,Cube, Eazy, or Ren. Pick up 'Straight Outta Compton', Dre's'The Chronic', Ice Cubes'The Predator', Ren's'Kiss my black azz' or Eazy's 1988 debut."
2,Didn't we learn from the Nazi's?,"This is one of the worst and most sick albums ever released. I gave it two stars because ""Alwayz into Something"" sounds fantastic, ""Real N*ggas"" talked about prevailent rascism in America and ""Automobile"" was hilarious in a gross and politically incorrect way.... but the rest of it was horrible.They devoted the entire second half of their album to woman-hating, and in songs like ""One Less B*tch"" and ""She Swallowed it"", they actually give directions to its listeners of how to rape and murder women.How do they justify this all? the say women are greedy gold diggers.... that's exactly what the Nazis said about the Jews. And the Nazi's like N.W.A. were hailed as articulate and socially conscious spokespeople for a generation. And yet people swallow all this ... just because the beats are dope (which, admittedly they are).This is one Rap album that SHOULD have been banned. Unfortunately we've learned nothing."
2,Very Average,"Considering What N.W.A had done on Straight Outta Compton&100 Miles&Runnin this is kinda So-So.Dre's Beats are Bumping,Eazy is Funny as Always but Ren wasn't Happening.&Compared To Cube's Amerikkka's Most Wanted N.W.A Seemed Like Old News On This Disc.CUBE Took Alot Away when he Left."
5,!!!!,"This album like every other NWA album is the definition of a rap music classic. The worlds greatest group ever, the people who really put west coast on the map, drop their last album this time without talented rapper and lyricist Ice Cube. He went away because of money dissagreements and the groups menages perfectly without him. The music is again ruthless hardcore gangsta rp over some of the greatest production ever held by Dr. Dre and Yella. The lyrics are hard as ever - MC Ren is incedible as usually and Dre and Eazy come up perfect as well. Accept a few comedy tracks, this album does it all. A true great album, a must have for a real rap fan. It's the definition of greatness. it even Has the greatest intro ever."
4,NWA went out like they came in: With the best they had!,"After Cube left, they put all their anger and energy into their last album. They did not disapoint. Niggaz4Life is truly worthy of a group who put out so many great records. The last line of the album is ""The Joke is on you Jack! We did it again!"" They sure did."
1,The Title Fits Them Perfectly!,"Ice Cube went solo & had a successful career. Even though some of his songs were pretty harsh language wise, Cube always told a story, painted a picture of a young misinformed Blackman from the ghetto. Cube gave you the negative but balanced it with the positive. Cube's counterparts NWA completely fell into the bottomless pit of ignorance & couldn't recover. NWA's so called ""street knowledge"" in reality was ""street nonsense."" Without Cube writing the lyrics, NWA relies on ignorant word play & the most worst display of misogyny I have ever heard. There is nothing landmark about this cd, NOTHING! If I could have given this trash a zero I would. N4L fits these lames because only ""N"" would degrade their people as well as themselves this way."
5,Make My Funk The P-Funk!,"This album is simply amazing.Even though almost every song is made by sampling p-funk, each one is unique and not a single one is skip-able. The bass loops are heavy and are splashed with other funky elements, it's a beautiful blend.Both E double and Pmd spit in this crazy nonchalant, almost sleepy manner but it works very well. E's voice is very unique...he can make a very simple line sound complex.""Please listen to my demo"" has the best beat on the album. It's a slowed down p-funk type loop which totally reflects the mood of the song, kind of somber and almost sad. The song is about their initial trouble getting their name out.I'd give the album 6 stars if I could."
1,Theme not very carefully defined,"The title of Mr. Brown's book is deceiving. He asserts to write about sexual renunciation in early Christianity. Instead he basicly writes about sexual renunciation in among the Gnostics. There is a good reason why devoted Christians of all denominations view Gnosticism as a heresy. Gnosticism is very much rooted in pagan, i.e. Indian and Persian religious esoteric beliefs. As scholars like A. Vööbus (""History of Asceticism in the Syrian Orient"") have shown, sexual asceticism is not anything originally Jewish or Christian, but has been taken over by certain groups of Christians from Eastern religions. Of course, these groups have heavily influenced church Christianity and made Christians and non-Christians alike believe that celibacy is a truly christian virtue. However, church christianity has never been exactly the same kind of Christianity as the one depicted in the New Testament."
4,Not bad......,"A good book for the baseball fan. A ghost, a murder, and baseball: what else is there? John Carver does a great job describing East Texas as well as life on a minor league baseball team. The story is interesting, with unexpected twists and turns. A must have for those who love the game of baseball or someone from East Texas. Also, an entertaining read for anyone looking for a story ""off the beaten path."" I look forward to reading Carver's other book, ""Winning."""
1,Waste of money,"Unlike the In-fisherman of old this DVD is pretty much a waste of time and money. It starts out well with Pyzer and Stange discussing early season movements and catching some bass. Then the vast majority of fish they catch are Northern Pike. I understand an occasional Pike but it got ridiculous. Then the next segment starts with Redfish! They start by talking about SALTWATER! If I wanted saltwater I would have bought saltwater. This is the first DVD I bought of the ""new"" in-fisherman and it will certainly be the last. Your money would be better spent on Al and Ron's Angling Edge DVD's. Much more informative and much less BS. I tried to write In-fisherman and got NO repsonse. If it were possible to give a negative star rating this would be a -1."
1,save your money,"I received one for Christmas, installed it easily on my van, however less that a week after I installed it it broke off. It is made of plastic and in cold weather (which is indicative of the northwest) the part that spins gets too cold and will snap off while driving."
2,breaks too easily,"Made of plastic, these decorative propellors break too easily when a rock in the road or something else hits it, rendering it useless. I wrote to the company to inquire if this was common, and they never had the courtesy to respond back to me. Aluminum would be a better choice if someone would consider making it; being a soft, flexible metal it should not cause harm in an accident as opposed to steel. Perhaps some braniac will consider this in the future."
2,breaks too easily,"Installed the propeller hitch cover easily back in November. Less than three months later one of the blades broke, on a vehicle that is not driven very often. If it is unable to be made in steel for safety purposes, how about aluminum or some other soft metal alloy that will be flexible but not break as easily as the plastic?"
4,A Second Wallander,"PBS introduced us to Kenneth Branaugh as Detective Wallander, the subject of Henning Mankell mysteries. I find this older series starring Krister Henrikkson equally good. The plots are pure Mankell bizarre and the cast might actually be better. Have no hesitation in collecting this series - great entertainment with Volvos running across the countryside, eccentric people, and less effort given to portraying tortured souls."
5,Smitty,A great movie for all ages. Touches ones life as to how behavior can be changed once good influence is accepted and carried out.
4,"Early James, still a cut above the rest (no pun intended).","P.D. James' second Dalgliesh novel, A Mind to Murder. was originally written in 1963. The preoccupations of the time are visible in the book-- changing social mores, counseling for failing marriages, disillusioned young artists, and experimental psychological treament. The Steen clinic makes an excellent backdrop to both explore these issues and to set the scene for murder.When the correct and absolute Enid Bolam is found stabbed in the basement of the Steen outpatient clinic, Dalgliesh needs to find who killed her-- was it someone looking to the future or to the past?_A Mind To Murder_ is not as smooth or as perfect as some of James' later work, but is still an excellent mystery and well worth the time to read."
2,Substandard,Not up to her usual standards as it became ponderous toward the end with the conclusion a little too par
3,"not the best, by a long way.","I was disappointed in this book. As an avid Dalgleish fan, I found the writing quite dreary , the plot loose and the writing dated, compared to the gripping and intricate plots and the detailed insights into characters psyches in the other books in this series. This is my least favourite Dalgleish book to date."
3,"Early James, for her devoted followers","This James novel has elements of her superb plotting and excellent pace, but somehow has an otherworldly feel to it, a lack of reality that chafes at the reader. Its as if the book was written in the '50s and the characters suspended in time, until James pulled it out of a suitcase when she became popular. The characters seem much more one-dimensional than in her later work, and in a few cases are pure stereotype. But she does an admirable job of dispensing red herrings, and I'll be honest and admit that I didn't guess the killer"
3,A little tiresome,"I enjoy PD James and her Adam Dalgliesh mysteries, but this one was tiresome. I finished, but didn't care when I got to the end. Even a tiresome PD James is better than most authors great books. The characters are a bit flat and there are too many of them. The first part was acceptably interesting, but then it seemed to rush towards an end that was of little impact. It's an early book, maybe that's why."
3,A mind to murder,"The book I read was A mind to murder by P.D. James. It was about a lady who was found murdered in a record room, with a chisel in her heart and a werid wooden symbol in her arm. This book takes place in a Clinic where all employees are trying to find the murderer. They are calling people and asking them to come and help. At the end of the book, they find out who did it. I would recommend this book to kids 13 and up, because it might scare children younger then that."
3,His & Hers Volume One (2007),"Yes, Yes, of course there's only one reason I purchased this compilation of various artists, put together by Amanda Scheer Demme, who was responsible for the soundtrack for the movie Garden State, and that was because Luna's production of ""Bonnie & Clyde"" is presented here ... and being a Galaxie 500, Luna, and Dean & Britta compete-ist, of course I just had to have it.There's nothing sensational about the collection, many of the artists you may not have heard of before, and to that end, it's a fine disc to cue up when company's over and you don't want to challenge anyone's musical tastes, or you're just feeling too wasted to make any decisions for yourself, or perhaps you simply desire a face down in the pillow one eye open mindless collapse ... after all, that's the fun of these various artists outings, especially when you're able get them for a buck or two.Review by Jenell Kesler"
4,Great Read!,"I was initially intending to read the book as a guide to riding the East Coast trip. However, the book is more of an account of the authors trip. I would recommend it, it is a great story on it's own merits. I would advise that it is not a ""how to"" book."
5,Great fun to read,"This is a really good and fun book to read. The author makes it very easy to literally ""see"" him and feel all the highs and lows of his trip. Anyone who dreams of taking a solo trip across a large part of the country (whether on a bicycle or not) will enjoy this book. I am anxious to see his next book."
3,Dust cover slightly marred,The book its self was in good condition but the dust cover had some rubbed/scratch areas. As this book was for a 10 year old boy I gave it as a gift anyway - he probably will never notice it. In it's condition I wouldn't have given it to anyone much older.
5,An unforgettable world!,"Dinotopia is the creation of a world where dinosaurs and man work as a team. Yes, that sounds corny to anyone who hasn't read any of the Dinotopia books. At least, that's what I thought when a friend recommended that I read them. Normally, I'm not into fantasy and/or fiction books, but this one definitely grabbed my attention and kept it. When an author is THIS good at creating a complete world no one has ever seen and convincing ME that perhaps it actually DOES exist somewhere....well, then that author is a ""master."" Way to go!"
5,Dinotopia,"Dinotopia was the first book James Gurney wrote in this series. The artwork was what initially drew me into the story and I found sweatshirts, posters, calendars, pins...you name it, with these chaarcters on them. The storyline was easy to follow, as it was written in diary format.The things I really found interesting were the song (notes and lyrics) and the code for the Dinotopian written language (footprints). My students love writing letters and stories in Dinotopian to each other and for daily assignments. After teaching it for almost 10 years students are as much in love with the story as I am and they want to read it over and over. The artwork makes for great writing prompts and gives kids ideas for sculpture and watercolor pieces."
4,"Excellent condition, professional service","This hardcover book was in excellent condition with only a name plate inside the cover as indicated in the description. The book was shipped promptly and was beautifully packaged.In all a wonderful value.The book is a fantasy delight for all ages. For those who are knowlegeable about dinosaurs -- they will find that accuracy of the detail stunning. The story is fun, and the illustrations exceptional."
5,Dinotopia lives -- as Naboo in Star Wars I,"Gurney's illustrations are truely timeless. They've recently been reproduced in craven and uncredited detail by the ""art"" team of Star Wars I : the Phantom Menace. See in particular the layout of Waterfall City, the monumental arches, and the triumphant procession. So striking was the resemblance that back when we saw the very first preview of P.M. my son and I looked at each other and said in one voice ""Dinatopia."" Apart from the look of the sets, the two stories are worlds apart. ""Breath deep. Seek peace."" say the gentle Dinatopians. ""May the Force be with you."" say the Star Warriors. I guess the Force figures it can take whatever it wants... Check out the original."
4,Beautiful artwork...an adventure story with social messages,"Dinotopia will appeal to different age groups for different reasons. Very young children (especially those interested in dinosaurs) will understand little of the story, but will appreciate the multitude of dinosaur pictures. You can 'read' this book to a very young child by simply commenting on each page's pictures.Slightly older children will begin to be engaged by the story...an adventure tale, presented as if the book were a lost journal that has been recovered.Youth and adults can appreciate the story's deeper messages about peace and simplicity of living, and the beautiful artwork...far beyond the typical illustrations in a children's book, both in quantity and quality."
3,A sister is forever,In the beginning the book started off as two sisters telling how they are specialto each other.Then how they have not got along in the past but can put that asid.They knew they both was an angel inside.Then they said how they wish each other a good life.so I realy recomind you to read this book.It is very good.
3,Good Product,"It seems to work alright. The installation instructions were bad. The ""upgraded"" cord it comes with is a good idea but didn't work on my TV."
4,monster in wall power center,"Very well designed product. Great idea with one module with nylon fibers to help run, and make cables more attractive coming through wall. Flat receptable plug in for behind t.v. is a great idea, but the other end would not fit in my Panasonic with the bump out on the end. Contacted Monster cable on their web page,and asked them for information if they had any that would fit into my Panasonic, and they did not respond. Over satisfied, but not happy with their customer service not responding."
3,Damian Lewis is one of the BEST>,"This was a very unusual film. I liked it because of Damian Lewis, he is always at the TOP of his game."
5,Both reward and supplement!,"This skin and coat supplement as doubles as a reward for most of our furrie little friends. 3 out of 4 cats* I know love to lick this off my finger and will even sit (mostly) still for claw trimming when they know they'll get their Nutrimalt at the end.* Ok, one hates the stuff and has to be forced to eat it. But that's cats for you!"
1,Would Not Recommend,"Although I had a great experience with the vendor which had wonderful customer service and a generous return policy (they paid for the return shipping), I just was not happy with the quality of this product.The painting was sloppy and there were black paint smudge marks on several areas of the canisters. Perhaps I should not have expected much for this price point, but based on the other review, I had hoped this would be a better product than it turned out to be.The good news is that when I called the vendor, they were very understanding and sent me a pre-paid return label and refunded 100% of my purchase."
4,Please reprint this book.,"I'm a student in USA. I came from Asia. When I was in my country, I never cooked. In this small town I stay now, there's no good Thai or Chinese food in an affordable price. This book really helps me. Some details in some dishes may differ from I experienced in my country, but very similar. This book guarantees succesful and delicious food.My american friend wants to buy this book for his mom and I like him, so I wish somebody reprint it...pleas..please. However if you're a great asian chef, this book may make you bored. Sorry for my broken English."
4,Simple and Fun book,"This book is really simple in terms of teaching you about the art of sushi. In addition to that, it has some really fun things that you can make. I had never thought of sushi as an art until I saw this book."
1,good pics,it is nice book for who wants to know more the nigiri or sashimi stylebut it shows you just the basics
1,poor,"come on ! HAM in sushis..... !! maybe beautiful sushi design but sushi use to be with fish, no ?"
5,For Grandmom....,I ordered this book for my 97 year old Grandmother after she told me this was one of her favorites as a child. She was thrilled to have this book again.
2,Not a bad old-fashioned read,"This is an interesting read--but I found it required concentration due to the ""Thubway Tham's"" lisp (all the TH are supposed to be ""S"") It's a series of cute short stories/adventures of a subway thief. They are interesting and cute, but not necessarily action-packed adventures. You find yourself wanting to help Thubway Tham--lift him out of his own misery, help him...he's a good egg even if he is a pickpocket...and in the end, you always are left with the feeling that he will have another day to whistle in the subways, meandering rather aimlessly through life, reminding you of a harmless hobo, happily riding from place to place."
1,We need a hip hop garbage man to take this hot garbage out!,"Khia is one of the worst female MC's (most confused) ever! She raps about trash and looks like trash too. Gangstress?!?!?!?! Why don't you try being a woman, mother, and a respectable person first! The lyrics on this album are poor. The beats are corny and the whole concept behind this album is commercial and lame just like the first one. Make sure to get a gander of all the hoodrat pictures on the cover!!!! LOL!!"
2,Khia... Khia.. Khia,"Khia once again made a fool of herself on this album. Yeah we all know she straight ghetto I love her fun side just saying what she wants but if u expect to sell well and be well known all around the world for other hits beside ""My Neck My Back"" she desperatly needs to find other people to work with on her albums. Khia obvoiusly wants to always be known for putting out trashy music.. yea."
3,at least the trina diss is worth listening to,"I loved how the diss fights between her, trina, and jacki o was going back and forth that's the only reason to really buy this unless you're a serious khia fan she really contradict herself she talked about oral; sex just like her 2 so called opponents maybe khia's upset cause trina won't sleep with hjer poor baby how sad really all 3 should make a cd together."
4,'Who am I? I'm thung misses...,"Y'all gonna respect me...' I found it funny how so many people are expecting some great hip hop album from Khia and reading most reviews, she just get's bashed over and over. Come on people! There is a reason that acts like Khia exist...for our pure entertainment. She is beyond trashy and that is exactly why I love her! Not since Choice has there been a female rapper who's so explicit in her sexual desires and all done over witty and raunchy lyrics. Songs like ""B*tch MF Got Damn"", ""F**king Me Tonight"", ""Snatch The Cat Back"", etc. are examples of Khia's trashiness! I love the interlude entitled ""Questions For The Ni**az""...hilarious!!! So when listening to Khia just remember it's all about the fun."
1,A Dry Attempt of a Book,"I was dissapointed at reading this new book by Pat Montandon.I truly expected more celebrities than Oprah and Burt Reynolds.The stories that have been compiled in this book seem fabricated , like another stunt to get people's attention.Though some of the material was entertaining,the impression that i got was that of a dull read.If you enjoy a book with a beautiful lay-out, then Celebrties and their Angels might be just what you're looking for."
5,Love it!,I got this bible as a gift to myself :-) The super soft cover is beautiful. The font is not too small or too big. I am thrilled.
5,Gift bible,"I love the bible it is just small enough I can carry it in my purse,and the words are big enough I don't need my reading glasses to read it. I love it."
2,Pass the Magnifying Glass,This is a very nice book---it a bargain for the price. Attractive and nicely bound but it's printed on onion skin in very small type. The type is far too small for casual reading...I'm ordering something else and will give this one away.
4,Beautiful Bible...,"Perfect size to be carried around in your purse or bag pack, beautiful color combination, the covers feel so soft, it's like real leather but better, because it's not.Soft, thin paper. Jesus' words in red, I like that.I didn't give it 5 stars though because it doesn't stay open while reading, I've really had to bend it so it does stay open some how, I hope it doesn't break with time.I love the silver color it has on the sides, it's gorgeous actually.I'd say it's worth every penny, it's very cheap but it's a beautiful overall Bible. I think it would work also very well as a gift."
5,Quick and Pain free,I ordered this book and it came very quickly. It was in excellent condition. I recommend this seller.
4,"almost a ""10""","This bible is beautiful. I really like the fact that the words of Christ are in red. I would have given the book 5 stars if the font would be larger. Larger type would make reading much easier on the eyes. That is the book's only downfall, otherwise, it is an excellent bible."
2,I was expecting more tips and tricks,"From the blurb on Amazon, I was expecting more tips, tricks and handholding from this book. Basically it's just recipes with a glossary in the back of cooking terms and herbs and spices.There are some entertaining tips but I would go to [online store] for a book like that. Not exactly what I expected when this book arrived. Also, I'd like to have nutritional information because we like to plan our meals to be moderately healthy."
5,"Great Food,Simple and Fast","not a newlywed but i like to eat. Simple, easy and elegant recipes. Short prep times excellent results the majority of the items most people have already or they are easy to find. Good book for a bad cook."
5,Classic Spidey,"From 1967 an animator named Ralph Baski did the first few entries in this series. More than any other cartoon at the time; with the exception of Hanna Barbera's Fantastic Four cartoon, these cartoons followed the comics more than not. I love the scenes where Spidey swings through New York City. It is primative by today's standards but brings back lots of memories for me because I loved those cartoons. I can only wish that Marvel makes a complete DVD set of this classic. Only thing is I don't believe so because no one is interested. This one was ahead of its time because it tapped into the superhero in all of us."
3,"GREAT,MEMORABLE YET SHORT",Great memorable video featuring the 1967 Spider-Man episodes: THE ORIGIN OF SPIDER-MAN AND THE KILLOWATT KAPER. If you like Spider-Man get it but this video is too small! They should have put on several episodes not just one and a half!! Maybe they should have had Stan Lee select 10 of his favourite episodes!!
4,Origin of Spider-man 1967 Marvel comic classic,"I bought this video last year. Its about 45 minutes long. It faithfully tells the story how Peter Parker became Spider-man. He goes to a science demonstration. Check's out an experiment and get's bitten by a radioactive spider. Later, he goes for a walk to get some air, and finds that he can cling to walls just like a spider."" Kiliwatt Kaper"", is the return of Electro. He want's to drain all of NY cities power, and hold it for ransom. Can Spidey stop Electro in time! Watch this episode & find out!"
1,poor design,"i installed this mouse, and i have to say i'm returning it. When I clicked once on buttons, the click never took, so I was finding myself having to click 2x to do what 1 click should have done. Maybe it's a combo of my windows XP and this mouse not working, but I'm not impressed at all. I'd take my regular mouse back any day over this one. I also noticed a bit fo a lag time when moving this mouse about and it seemed harder to ""target"" things - liek I'd click on a line to insert text and I needed to click several times before the cursor landed in the correct spot. Maybe it's just me, but I'm computer literate and this oen just isn't workign for me. back it goes!"
3,6000 Mouse,"It is pretty big, I have small hands. I haven't really used it yet, but it has many features that you can program into each button. It is nice."
2,This would be a FIVE star mouse if it didn't have major problems.,"This mouse has great ergonomics. It's small and fits in your hand. The fact that it is wireless makes it better. I have been using this mouse for months now. I have THREE of them on three different computers: Windows XP, Mac OS X and Fedora Linux.Problems1. The mouse buttons do not always register even after multiple clicks.2. The mouse movement is rough. You would think that a laser mouse would be more accurate but it is less.3. Eats batteries! You will be replacing batteries very often with this mouse.I have already switched one out for a wired basic MS optical mouse. I hope they recall these mice because if they can fix the flaws, they would get 5 stars. I'm giving them 2 because they did such a good job on the ergonomics."
3,Very good Wireless Mouse... But,"I just bought the Microsoft wireless mouse and think it is a pretty good overall mouse. The major problem I have is the very short range, it is only about 3 feet. If it was 6 feet I would have kept the mouse, but at 3 feet, I couldn't keep it. I am going with the Logitech which I understand has a much larger range."
3,Decent but buttons are really flawed,"Good wireles mouse. Can be used on a variety of surfaces. I can even use it with my laptop on my bed w/o a mouse pad. Good range. Never ever ever had a problem with accuracy, not even due to range.My biggest complaint is the middle mouse button (or wheel button). I use this to open new pages in Firefox. But with the MsWLM 6000, it is VERY difficult to depress this button. I find this very annoying as I use it quie often. It's especially annoying since previous Microsoft optical mice had very easy middle mouse buttons to push.There are 2 buttons adjacent to the left mouse button (fwd and back for web pages). The fwd button is NOT easy to get to without looking at the mouse... or unless you have a very long thumb. I've never used these buttons (I use the Backspace key to go back a page) and I've used the Explorer mouse since 2001. But if you do use these buttons, that could pose a problem for you."
4,"It works great, but ............","Great new product. I bought the Notebook version. Only problem is, when the receiver is plugged into a USB port, Windows screen saver will never kick in. Once you unplug the receiver, presto! - screensaver works.Other than that, it's a great little mouse for notebook use."
1,WARNING...FAULTY DESIGN!!!!,"This mouse rarely responds to clicking function. This is an epidemic among most, if not all, 6000 owner/users. Google "" Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 ""does not respond"" "" and you will see that this issue is very common. I've tried all the MS suggested solutions and have tried it on both mac and pc with the same results. Also, the wireless range is very weak. I have to keep the transceiver under 6 inches from my mouse/keyboard. Save your self the headache; DO NOT BUY!!!"
3,Can't be used by left handed people,"This mouse works fine. Tracks well, good feel, good response. The problem is that IT IS DESIGNED EXCLUSIVELY FOR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE! If you are left handed, you can not use this mouse effectively. They need to print on the box : ""For right handed people only."" I had to return the mouse because I am left handed."
2,"Great, but tweaks OS","I love this mouse! It's compact and picks up the signal on just about EVERY surface. I gave it 2 stars because I figured out that it was preventing my laptop from going into idle mode (Windows XP, SP2). Sadly, I'm going to have to get another mouse because of that."
2,Transmitter/Receiver Not Powerful Enough,"The new transmitter/receiver is not powerful enough. Mouse functionality is blocked by my laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad) due to the USB port being on the left side and I use the mouse on the right side.If I move the mouse to the left side of the laptop next to the receiver, it works great. Wonderful for left handed users, not so much for right.I suppose if your USB ports are in back of your laptop, you would not have as much trouble. My older Microsoft notebook mouse with the ""twist up"" receiver worked much better."
2,All Microsoft Mice Have a Huge Problem ...,"... with their Intellipoint driver software. It won't let you assign a function to the tilt wheel! For example, in Firefox, you can assign the tab browse keystroke to the tilt wheel if you have a Logitech mouse. Tilt right - next tab. Tilt left ... you get the idea. It's a great way to work, and you can't do it with any Microsoft mouse, just because of their poorly designed (or lazy) software.This mouse tracks well on most surfaces, better than my new Logitech, though. However, the button on the side is hard to press, and your thumb will get irritated after a while. So it depends on your needs."
1,Poor manufacturing,"My first mouse of this type was DOA and never worked. I returned it. The second one worked right out of the box. While playing around with it, I activated the magnifier. Neat idea I thought, until I could not turn it off. Even when the mouse is put away, I could not undo the magnification on my new Thinkpad so I may need to get yet a third one just to turn this feature off. I suggest avoiding it in the first place."
3,Positives and negatives.,"I bought two of these on sale. One is being used on a Windows XP Home Edition PC. The other is on a Windows XP Media Center PC.Positives:1. Pointer is very precise.2. Wheel is very silky and scrolls well.3. Right, left and rear thumb buttons work well.Negatives:1. Does not grip well if you want to pick it up.2. Front thumb button too far forward for effective use.3. On both computers the magnifier will turn on but then will not turn off and so I had to disable that feature since I could find no info on correcting the problem on the web. In fact, the READ ME file that came with the mouse software said the magnifier might not work with the media center. This is a Microsoft mouse and they can't get it to work with their operating system! Hmmmmmm"
1,Very poor tracking - worst Microsoft mouse I've owned,"I bought this mouse thinking it'd be better than the 5000 series (and other wireless mice). Boy was I wrong! This is the worst Microsoft mouse I've ever owned. The laser might be precise, but it's highly inaccurate!It won't track on my desk (simple wood desk). I have to put down paper underneath it so it'll track, and even then it does a poor job.Stick to the other non-laser Microsoft mice (The ""Wireless Optical"" ones, like the 5000). I've never had a problem with them, and they track just fine on all sorts of surfaces."
5,Great for Mac too,"Always worried about things working with our Mac, but installation was a breeze. The mouse itself is awesome. It is our first laser mouse and its response is almost faster than my brain moves."
1,It works nice just for the first month,This is the worst mouse I've ever used. After one month of usage the plastic under my thumb became black and rough. The wheel worked well just for the first month. Then I was hardly able to rotate it with my finger. And I expect a mouse to work nice for about two years. So my recommendation is to avoid bying this mouse.
3,Nice Mouse---But,"After 5 successful, trouble-free months a problem developed and persists.The scroll wheel, more often than not, feels rough, like it's being dragged over a rough road. Tried the canned air routine, didn't work.Microsoft on-line support is no help, except they did give me a phone number to call. The mouse must still be under warranty. Why can't they just give me a return merchandise number, give me the address to send it to and be done with it?I can only imagine what it would be like to call Microsoft on a phone. If you ever get off of hold, will you be able to understand the helpful person?"
1,can no longer use after 2 months -- bad scroll wheel,"I am a web media professional, so I admit that I am an excessive scroll wheel user, but a mouse should be able to take any non-abusive input that is given to it for at least a year. However, this unit was not able to. It isn't the first time I've had problems with a Microsoft Mouse's scroll wheel. Something about the gears aren't right for me, as they wear out and become hard to use. While the Microsoft mice may be ergonomic and easy to use, I find them overpriced and not reliable. I prefer the Kensington Pilotmouse Optical which has been a very good value."
4,"""Comfort? Music","I saw ""Homecoming"" on PBS and was entranced. The interaction between Andre Rieu, the music and the audience [his home town friends] was marvelous. For me a CD to be savoured. An artist I shall await the next recording,"
3,Homecoming Disappoints,"How can you be disappointed with any Andre Rieu material? I had viewed The Homecoming on DVD - absolutely marvellous - I have seen nothing better. I later purchased the CD but was disappointed. All the music on the CD was terrific, however, I did not check the track listing prior to purchase and discovered that many of my favorites from the DVD were missing. I was disappointed and maybe it would have been feasible to have made a double CD. It was my problem because I did not check the track listing but I would loved to have the songs missed also on CD."
3,Would Probably Work Better if I used it More Often,"This was an interesting device that I found to help my husband (and myself) with our carpal tunnel syndrome. It does help, but would be more effective if I used it more often."
5,Great set of bits!,Was happy when I recieved these bits because the case was a lot nicer than I was expecting. Also have used just about every bit so far and they cut great. Just as nice as a lot of the over priced sets out there.
4,Love It!,"I can't tell you how how much I love the song ""Scatterlings of Africa."" I heard it in the early 1980's and have love it for about 25 years."
4,Great keyboard,"I actually bought this keyboard to use with one of my computers that I don't use two often. It has a nice feel, it's compact, and heavy enough it won't move around. The cord is really long.I've had the PFUCA Happy Hacking keyboard for years, which has the same footprint as this keybord, but the construction quality is better, has much larger keys, and it has a layout that is better for programming."
3,Meh.. ok..,"I got this thinking it'd be ideal for the ps2, only to realize later I could plug in just aboutany usb keyboard I wanted an it'd work all the same.The reason for this rating is because its such a SMALL keyboard.. people with avg or larger hands look out!"
5,Exceptional educational tool.,"My wife and I are retired teachers and use this series with our 4 year old grandson. The programs are so interesting that he seems to learn even when he is not in the mood, because he likes to watch the DVD's."
4,Very good product,"My daughter just turned 3 and had very little interest in letters and numbers until I purchased this set. I highly recommend these DVDs for their cognitive content. The Letter Factory and Math Circus are the ones that are at her level or a little above her level. The other DVDs will be more appropriate in time. One thing I do not appreciate about the DVDs is how they tend to emphasize pronouncing letters ""perfectly"" and there's a push to being ""the best."" I don't value that kind of competitiveness especially in young children. Cognitively, it's a great set; socio-emotionally, it's not ""perfect."""
4,Awesome Learning Tool,"I bought this DVD set for my 3 year old. The Letter Factory DVD is the best one. She learned what sounds each letter makes in only 5 days! It is entertaining and fun to watch. She asks to watch it all the time. I only gave this set 4 stars because the other videos are not that good. They do not grasp her attention at all and she does not learn anything from them. The letter factory is the only one worth while. If I could do it all over again, I would not buy the entire set. I would only buy the Letter Factory video by itself. We have had it for 2 weeks and she is already spelling out words because she knows each letters sound. Amazing!"
5,Great learning Tool,My 4-year-old loves watching The Letter Factory series. She can recognize letters in print and remembers their sounds because of the cachy songs used in the videos. This is a wonderful product.
5,Best learning tool for children,"This is my second purchase of leap frog learning 5-pack dvd only because my children watch them so much they have nearly worn them out.(smile) This is a wonderful and creative fun learning tool for children. All three of my children benefit a lot from these programs. At the age of 11 months both my son and daughter knew how to pronunciate the entire alphabet. I recommened this product for any child who struggles with reading. leap frog, you get a million stars for this one."
5,Leap Frog DVD 5 pack EXCELLENT,I absolutely love the LEAP FROG LEARNING DVD's. My five year old son has learned so much from these DVD's. I am one satisfied customer. Will positively purchase more Leap Frog learning materials. Would tell anyone interested that I suggest these products for helping little ones to learn.
5,very prompt,"They arrived quickly and were in perfect condition. These tapes are meant for early, emergent readers."
5,Wonderful Set of learning DVD's,"These have helped my daughter with her phonics skills and math. Before, she couldn't read at all. Now she begs to watch the movies, and she can even read simple books! we have had our movies for a little more than a week. She keeps thanking me for buying her the special movies. My 7 year old even likes to watch them with her, even though my 7 year old reads at a 9 year old level.Great investment into my children's education."
1,This is way too expensive !!!,I ordered this in 2007 for about $41.00. I thought these prises are high. I just ordered them seperately for $56.00. Just copy each title and paste it in a seperate window. Add 1 at a time to your cart. I got all mine through the same seller. DVD's $39.00 + shipping $17.00. I might expect to pay more 3 years later but this is ridiculous.
5,What a wonderful tool!,"My daughter's instruction at her school was lacking. I needed to find a way to help her learn myself. A friend of mine, a former teacher, recommended the Letter Factory. Within a couple of weeks, my daughter was getting her letters and sounds. I bought the pack, and she is loving the talking words factory. My older daughter loves it too. It is a great review for her."
5,Awesome tool for early reading!,"This has really inspired my son to connect the dots with letters and phonics, along with encouraging him to begin reading at the age of 4. Professor Quigley and the Frog family really make it fun for little ones. I have no qualms about putting on this video and letting him ""watch tv."" He is truly learning from this one. We were so impressed with it that we bought the ""Letter Factory"" for his Preschool. Had a bit of trouble with shipping (first order got lost in the mail) but once I called Amazon, they got another one in the mail right away and even upgraded to Priority Shipping for free. Excellent customer service!"
4,No hassel way to teach your kid phonics,I have a long commute with a 3 year old who chatters away which is great and I often get home late with no time to review what she has learned for the day. These DVDs are a great use of the commute time as she can watch them in the car and we can sing and bond... its great. The best part is that she is learning and I can see it as a three year old is not a great historian as to what happened during her day.
1,Not up to expectations,Not as good as I had imagined. Takes a while for the educational part to start when the DVD is first started. Not quite as gripping. Not much info in each DVD. Little Einstein DVDs seem a lot better way for education than this.
5,Very good!,My 3yrs old son really like it. He has been watching it for two weeks(every morning). Now he knows all of letters and their sounds .
4,Super Learning Tool,"The Letter Factory video was particulary good. This was the tool that I needed to get my 3 year old son interested in learning the alphabet. Before this video he was only interested in the letters in his first name. Now, in less than one month he knows all of the letters A-Z and the sounds that they make. He can tell me the letters in signs that he sees on stores, etc. Before the video we had tried reading, alphabet blocks, puzzles, songs, and many other techniques to no avail. He is very verbal, so I knew he had the capability...this video created the interest and now I am thrilled!The Math Circus is ok. It does seem a bit short, but it is a good review for my 5 year old.The Word Factory and Story Factory are also great. They are more of an introductory level, and it is hard for me to judge them since my daughter reads at almost a second grade level, so they are just a fun review for her, but great exposure for my 3 year old."
5,This UPN Kids series was incredible!..,"The Incredible Hulk aired on UPN Kids from September 1996 until September of 1999. The show was well animated and humerous, another marvelous animated series from Marvel, no pun intended. The only thing that confuses me is why Fox Kids video released it when it never aired on Fox Kids? It aired on UPN Kids."
5,Region 1 Discs are Uncut/ Uncensored!!!,"There's been a lot of discussion as to whether the Episodes on the the Region 1 discs are censored like the airings on BBC America.I am happy to report that the content (on an episode by episode basis) is EXACTLY the same as the Region 2 Discs. They even retained the opening credits song ""#1 Fan"" that was not used in the BBC airings.The only difference is that they are packaged according to BBC America's seasons, not as originally aired in the UK.On the UK Discs = Season 1: 6 Episodes / Season 2: 13 EpisodesOn the US Discs = Season 1: 10 Episodes / Season 2: 8 Episodes (I assume)"
2,Not The Full Versions - Censored/Edited,I would have given this set 4 stars if it were shown as they were originally made. But these are not.Be warned that this set does not contain the original episodes as aired in the UK. These are the BBC America versions of the episodes. This means they are cut down to 42 minutes (about 10 minutes removed from each episode!) and some content has been censored for language and nudity.
4,A randy British tale delving into....read on!,"A randy little story of a group of sex-starved coming of age students of a boarding school who stumble onto (to their misfortune) witchcraft,ghosts and satans top ""generals"" that are out for Cassie (mostly) and any other recruits they can find and, to their surprise,some recruits are those least likely to be possessed so grab yer bottle of st.johns wart and warm up to the telly! (some substance abuse & sexual situations)"
2,Heck(x),"After seeing the first two DVDs for Hex, I was disappointed. There is minimal story/plot line, the characters are lame, the special effects are strictly amateur. There are too many un-explained things going on that are obviously meant to keep us hooked, but not developed quickly enough to maintain our interest.The main villain has little personality. The main heroine is clueless too far into the series. She really needed to develop a brain that could keep up with the events - example, Veronica Mars, first two seasons. The main character was hard to visualize becoming a force to be reckoned with, but since she left after the first season (6 episodes), that becomes a moot point.I didn't bother with the third DVD. Although the reviews posted on Amazon were mostly positive, I have to agree with the few negative reports."
2,Sluggish,"Attractive cast, but the writers seem to be in search of a plot. The pilot took so long to establish the characters and backstory that I lost interest. I'm usually a fan of British imports especially the sci-fi and paranormal. This one seems to be imitating US shows, but the result is ineffective. Admittedly, I haven't watched the complete season. Maybe it gets better. Maybe I'll give it a go again, but not soon."
3,"Strong start, then very weak ending","The series starts very well and the first group of episodes are great. It then goes downhill until the end of Season 1 (in the US DVD set) which is not the proper Season 1 ending, so leaves you hanging and scratching your head wondering what happened. In reading about Season 2, things get worse so may be best to enjoy the first episodes and call it a day. The series never gets a proper finale and has been cancelled."
5,I have not anything like before,"My daughter introduced me to Hex last summer. I waited a whole year to watch the second season. BBC America showed last season and this season out of order, so I sat down one day and watched episodes 1 to 8. I plan to watch episodes 9, 10 and the deleted scenes real soon. I am now even more hooked than ever. I am waiting for Season 2 in region 1 NTSC format and I hope they make a Season 3, 4, etc. You can not compare this to Buffy because it is very different story. The only similarity is that they are both about the supernatural. I liked the Buffy series, but this series is better than Buffy, Angel, or Xena. Hooray for the British. Thelma is my favorite character because she is quirky."
4,BBC FAN,"Story about bitchy and beautiful boarding school young adults with British accent which is enough to hook anyone - with ghosts, psychic powers, demons and demon slayer along with a dash of humor BBC has created a sleeper hit. I have been enjoying this series, give it try you might like it too."
2,Muy Lenta...,"Demasiado lenta y aburrida, ademas en la segunda temporada al personaje de Cassie le dan cuello, demostrando lo malo que es el guion y tratando de darle empuje a la historia otorgando el protagonico a otra persona, aun asi resulta una mala serie, mejor compren Buffy o Charmed!!"
4,Good Series,"I wanted to say I enjoyed this series, it started a bit slow but pick up quickly. I just wish the second season was available in the US."
3,Gospel Lite but Whitney Shines!,"I was a bit disappointed in this CD. It seems that, rather than making it a truly gospel album, the producers chose several secular songs, including ""A Song for Mama,"" ""Lean on Me,"" and even Luther's stunning ""What the World Needs Now is Love."" Not that these songs aren't enjoyable - they are. They just aren't ""gospel,"" at least not to me.But all is not lost. Whitney Houston's ""I Love the Lord"" is almost worth the price of the CD. This is Whitney at her best and the song is spectacular. I also love Smokey Robinson's ""I Have Prayed on It.""If you're looking for solid gospel, buy WOW Gospel 2006. If you want ""gospel lite,"" this is the album for you!"
4,great Christmas ideas dishes for family and friends,My wife bought a copy several years ago and as a tradition picks a new dish to try each year. Each time it turns out to a big hit. After several moves the book was starting to fall apart. My wife was thrilled when I bought a brand new copy for her. I am not a cook at all but I enjoyed reading some of the discriptions and seeing the beautiful illustrations.
3,Good little film but one suspects the film makers have been writing their own reviews...,"OK, so we have five 5 star reviews here on Amazon. Can it be coincidence that there are also five 10 star reviews on IMDB?Seems someone may have a vested interest in hyping up this film.Regardless, it is good low budget picture. The sort of film I'll be glad to have in my collection in 20 years time when it's been forgotten.It has suspense, passable acting and a good premise. Liked the ending too.Well done to the film makers for a good job on small budget but please, let the quality of the film speak for itself (if indeed it is the film makers posting the top rated reviews).Mind you, I bought it based on those reviews so they did their job!"
1,"""The reviews I have read were misleading...""","I had high hopes for this film, because I've read some great things about it online. So, popping it into the DVD player, I was excited. I write this as I watch the film in digust.The reviews I have read were misleading, for this movie was not an instant classic, but one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is entirely in black and white (which annoys me), the acting doesn't do it for me, and it's not as scary as I said it was.The idea for the plot is very stupid. Two guys just appear in his house, and he doesn't do anything for about a half hour? It doesn't make much sense to me, and it is very bad.Overall, I'd say avoid this movie, because it is definitely one of the worst I've seen."
1,dont waste the money,this movie sucked big time for a b movie. here are the reasons1)the camera work sucked. it looked like it was done by an amateur. there was a seen where it was spinning around alot. i felt like i was goin to hurl.2)the acting was acceptable but definitely not the best. ive seen better b horror movies. you can tell that the person doing casting just picked decent looking people mainly dudes.3) the plots where horrible. through half the movie it was the 3 guys talking about what the host was goin to do for the rest of his life. then the a small segment was the host being chased by the two guests. finally the host was bound to the tub while the viewer is puzzled why he is being tortured by the 2 guests.there isnt any real plus about this movie unless u like to see a quick seen of a Paris Hilton-esque type of home movie on this feature.
5,THE MAAD CIRCLE !!!!...A MUST HAVE...,"THIS WAS OUT BEFORE ALL OF THIS SO CALLED "" SOUTHERN-CALI. RAP "" EMERGED...FOR INSTANCE, WESTSIDE CONNECTION/MACK 10/EASTSIDAZ/THE GAME/SNOOP DOGG/ETC...ALL OF THAT STUFF DOESN'T COME REMOTELY CLOSE TO "" AIN'T A DAMN THING CHANGED...""....THIS ALBUM IS TRULY A "" CLASSIC ""...""DRESS CODE"", ""BEHIND CLOSED DOORS"", ""OUT ON A FURLOUGH"", AIN'T A DAMN THING CHANGED""....THAT'S 4 REASONS WHY THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST RELEASES TO COME OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA....ALL THE RAP THAT W.C. DID AFTER THIS, DIDN'T COME CLOSE TO WHAT HE BROUGHT ON THIS ALBUM...* D.O.C. ""NO ONE CAN DO IT BETTER""* N.W.A.* WC AND THE MAAD CIRCLE* C.P.O "" TO HELL AND BLACK ""* SCC "" SOUTH CENTRAL MADNESS ""* CMW "" IT'S A COMPTON THING "".....THOSE ARE THE MUST-HAVE CALI. CLASSICS...."
5,Nice smell,This is a great lotion that felt very creamy but it wasn't greasy. I used it all summer long to moisturize my body since I used the tan towelletes. I'm happy with the lotion because it had minimal ingredients and the scent was very nice and not overpowering at all. The lotion left a very soft sheen look to my skin. The price is great and the bottle lasted me a very long time. This is great for normal to dry body skin! Made my tanned legs look supple and beautiful!
3,Go to Big Lots and get a similar one,This really isn't much of a discount. Its fine and works. Very plain looking but serves it purpose. You can get one at Big Lots cheaper.
4,Does what it is supposed to,"Very easy to install, it is solid, looks good, holds up the shower curtain. I can hang delicates from the rod and it stay secure. I would certainly purchase another one."
2,only lasted 3 months,"in less than 3 months, rod has lost its tension -- feels like a spring broke. that said, this was in my kids' bathroom, so it didn't get treated gently. but, i need a curtain rod that can handle a little bit of abuse."
1,Arrived in awful condition,"This item arrived with both ends scarred & dirty apparently from shipping.Item should have been wrapped to protect the ends. Only the rod, itself was wrapped."
5,Parent As Coach,"This book is a thoughtful and insightful body of wisdom about parents and teens. Diana Haskins provides a blueprint of extraordinary value for parents. Combining professional coaching skills with the love, care and priviledge of parenting, Diana offers tools, guidance and a fresh perspective to the unique relationship that exists between a parent and their teen. As a parent of 2 grown children, I found her messages to be 'right on' with the successful elements of parenting. This book is strong, supportive and positive----I highly recommend it to all parents with children of any age! Sheri Boone, Professional Coach, Portland, Oregon"
5,Worth the Ride,"In his newest offering, Within the Shadows, Brandon Massey successful weaves you into the everyday life of a contemporary male author, introduces you to his friends while you watch his routine, ordered existence transform into a supernatural drama full of twists and turns and unexpected ghostly encounters that keeps you eagerly turning the pages until the an explosive and unexpected end. At the end of this book the only word I came up with was ""WOW"". You won't be disappointed with this story! It's a great read.Brandon Massey's writing gets better and better. These characters are unforgettable and the story was skillfully orchestrated."
1,Reads like a poorly written comic book,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. If I hadn't been trying out my kindle I would have tossed it. Implausible plot, the language the author uses is juvenile, reads like a comic book."
3,"Good, but not great","This writer's style needs work. His plots are interesting, but his writing is hardly what I would call ""brilliant"". He has promise though, and I don't at all think following him as he matures in his craft would be a mistake."
2,Didn't like author's style,"Although the plot was mildly interesting, it was a little too 'far out there' to be truly captivating. I wasn't especially impressed by the author's writing style; I found his repeated inferences to the black culture interupted the material's flow. I most likely won't seek out other works by this author."
4,Creepy Supernatural Story,"This is actually the first book that I have read of Brandon Massey and it is a VERY good book. Let be start by saying that it develops SLOWLY, the beginning and the end are my favorite parts of the book. The plot keeps you wanted to know what will happen next. Bascially a writer named Andrew meets this extrememly attractive woman whom he later finds out may be something else underneath her beauty. It is full of suspense, danger, horror and the supernatural, it will be a treat but I believe that he has written better books that I will also read.One thing though is that it seems to be kind of anti-male, is the auther a male feminist? Hmmm, don't know, just kind of seemed to stereotype males a little bit.But it is a good read but also check out his other books."
5,"A frightfull, suspenseful, delicious read!","This was a very intense read. From the first page you are trapped by the suspense. There is never a dull, comfortable moment. The characters show resilience to conquer evil through even the darkest moments; and the wrath of this evil sends goose bumps across every page."
5,BUY THIS BOOK NOW!,"If you want a fantastic, erotic, scary, fast-paced thriller, look no further. This is the latest by one of my favorite horror authors, Brandon Massey. I've read all of his previous books (and short stories); his writing gets better and better.The characters are very real and extremely likeable. I was so engrossed that I read the whole book in about three hours.Buy it and you won't regret your purchase. While you're at it, check out his other novels. He is one author to watch - I predict more excellent novels in the future."
5,Supernatural at it's best!,"Oh my gosh!!! This is the best ghost book I have ever read! I want to tell the McBride person that I am not a paid friend or relative or have I ever heard of Brandon Massey until I bought this book, but I sure will read every other one he has ever written. I am just a grandma that loves a good book. If you love supernatural you owe it to yourself to read this one. Why can't people just read a book for the enjoyment of it and not try to put authors down for every little thing. Geez, lighten up. Mr. Massey if you see this, I want you to know that I LOVED the book. I just wish it would be made into a movie. My husband and I miss the good old scary shows. Keep up the great work, you have a new fan."
4,Good info,I like the Civil War and this is a very accurate account of all of the war. Filled with good information.
1,DVD set,at first DVD 1 did not work but after trying it several times it and #2 bith do work and is very good
3,Engaging view of God,"This book is part of a new publishing company called ""relevant books"" where their mission is to bring real issues to the surface and address them with a healthy realistic Christian perspective. Many times Christians have a way of avoiding some of the most difficult parts and questions of life, putting white box with pretty bow answers on some of the most soul wrenching questions. Rick doesn't.In this book, Rick will unpack the beauty and terror of wrestling with God. Wrestling with God is not something to be avoided, it is your relationship with God...those that don't wrestle just skim.If you are ready authentic faith, an honest and fresh view of the Christian life, pick up this book.My only critique is that the ending felt like a collection of scattered thoughts that he really wanted to add to the book. Overall, an excellent read!"
5,the A-SIDE is more than 5 star material...,"""bird in the hand""""mans best friend""""alive on arrival""- them 3 songs, rollin one behind the other, might be the best sequence of songs on any other rap album EVER!and actually, the entire first half of this album is pure classic... cube was always at his best when describing the social/urban conditions existing in america... (for his best social/political commentary, i'd hafta go with his work on the lench mob's album).but the three songs i mentioned above have continued to sound fresh and relevent over time...i have no problem comparing his commentary on this album with the likes of gil scott-heron or the last poets.libations for the lossof artists 'with somethin to say',conveying messages..."
4,"CLASSIC, CHAGRIN-CONTROLLED","DEATH CERTIFICATE is angrier than AMERIKKKA'S MOST WANTED. Perhaps too angry. And the result is...I would have given this album 5 stars, but the sporadic racist remarks were more bountiful this time. Apart from that, I still have love for you, Ice Cube! None of the songs stand out from one another; it is a consistent and cohesive album, and ALL of the songs are terrific. That is what Ice Cube is known for. It feels especially good for drive-by and summer seasons."
3,Cube was awesome on Amerikkka's Most Wanted but,"I remember he lost me on much of ""Death Certificate"". The only tracks I liked, and reminded me of Cube circa AMW, were ""Summer Vacation"", ""Steady Mobbin"" and ""Givin up the Nappy Dugout"". Other than those awesome tracks, the album is essentially a throw-away, with the rest of the songs unlistenable almost 10 years later. Oh yeah, don't forget to check out ""No Vaseline"", the greatest rap dis ever put down."
1,Get this chip off my shoulder!,"It's interesting to know that this album was released just prior to the L.A. riots. There's no doubt that many of the kids participating in the anarchy were fueled by the content in this album. After listening to it, it's easy to see how some would want to kill the man for all his institutionalized racism, and burn the stores owned by Koreans, because they be lookin at a brother like he gonna steal somethin."
1,Sickening,"Ice Cube spews forth the most hateful, vulgar, sexually debasing, racially antagonistic stream of filth I have ever had the displeasure of hearing."
1,they wouldn't even take it at the sewage treatment plant,"The title of this review says it all...oh, let me add that Ice Cube and most gangster rap also includes: hatred against jews, whites, and most other ethnic groups,domestic violence against women, glorification of the crime that plagues inner-cities, praising the murder of cops, selling drugs that kill people, etc. Is this really what some people call ""music""?"
1,How Many Funkadelic Samples can u steal and put on 1 album,wow every song has a funkadelic sample stolen make up your own beats u cant just take a song then put a loud shi*y drum beat over it
5,This album is amazing.,"Why is it amazing? For its _subtlety_. It has an allegory to slavery, it discusses std's and how to prevent them, and makes reference to the fact that the appearance of affluence isn't a guarantee the person is disease free. On another track it shows the mentality of _why_ people sell drugs, this is not the same as glorification, it simply shows what is. Yes it contains the obligatory dis tracks, in this case to his old group. Yeah the language if taken 100% at face value is crude, the craftsmanship is however superb. Ice Cube is cooler than cool."
5,you need this cd!!!,"this is one of the best ClASSiC albums to own!!! I remember buying this album 3 times cause people kept taking it out of the ride. you could tell that Ice cube was going to be a bigger star when he was flowing over the tracks-trust me!!! buy it and you will love it. sure he says things in a negative way, but what rapper doesn't?"
3,I liked it but...,"Overall Death Certificate just isn't up to par with Amerikkka's Most wanted. Still some Decent moments though, ""Steady Mobbin'"" is good with a funk-infused chorus. ""My Summer Vacation"" is perfect for just that, cruising 'round in July.On the down side, there's some disturbing messages. Ice expresses his disapproval for interracial dating on ""Horny Lil' Devil"", Hatred for Koreans ""Black Korea"", and his Anti-Semitic assault on N.W.A's manager ""No Vaseline"". These songs are distasteful and ruin the album.Death Certificate is a worthy purchase, but for new fans Amerikkka's Most Wanted is a better choice."
5,5 STARS NOT ENOUGH,"Has to be one of the top ten lps of all time in hip hop along with ""Amerikkka's Most Wanted"".""NO VASELINE"" pretty much ended N.W.A. as a group and is probably one of the most vicious comeback/rap battle songs of all time. If you listen closely to the lyrics of that song, he individually took each member of N.W.A. and basically cut them down to size by basically telling the truth. With the exception of M.C. REN, lyrically N.W.A. was finished after CUBE rolled out. DR. DRE'S production kept them afloat on EFIL4ZAGGIN but that's about it."
5,Another hit,"Ice Cube does it again. He makes Death Certificate even more hardcore and hotter than ever. He doesn't give a damn and will continue to rap about bitches, killing, drugs, and gangbanging. It's the world he knows and with those beats, you feel good about it. My favorite song though has got to be ""No Vaseline."" This is the BEST rap diss I have ever heard. What the hell is 50 cent's ""Piggybank?!"" That is SOFT! Ice Cube is so hardcore and gangsta on this track while he disses NWA. The beat and lyrics are amazing on this song and throughout the album. Ice Cube, you are the greatest."
4,Excellent Intro to DSP in Java,"While some the the awt gui stuff in the first part of the book may or may not apply to your needs (but it's easily adapted to swing if needed), Part II of the book provides excellent examples of digital signal processing in Java. The book also explains a flexible software architecture for plugging in effects at runtime. Code examples are nicely modular and can be easily adapted to more specific tasks. JMF examples are still very useful even after a number of updates to the Java Media Framework from Sun. Writing style is very straight forward and enjoyable. All around, a good read!"
5,AN ODDLY COMPELLING LOVE STORY,"I loved this book when I read it forty or fifty years ago and loved it again when I read recently in 2011. The writing style struck me as old-fashioned or eccentric, but didn't keep me from turning the pages. This is the only book I've ever read by Pearl Buck, so I have no basis of comparison regarding her writing style. One way or the other, it worked for me. As unlikely as the pairing of this couple was, I never doubted their lifelong desire for each other. It made me recall a sturdy, bright-eyed farm girl I knew when I was a boy seventy years ago. She lugged milk buckets and pitched hay, and had a quiet, attractive intelligence looking confidently out at the world. For me, this story lived. Highly recommended."
2,Eng/Spanish Dictionary,"Returned it yesterday. Drains battery power within an hour or so of use. May be a quirk, may be a model deficiency. Have no idea which at this point."
1,Frustrating,We have owned other Franklin products that have been great but this one falls short. The vocabulary is too limited and more times than not we can't even find the words from a basic 3rd or 4th grade spelling list. It is much faster to use the computer to look up words.
2,Small vocabulary database,"If you need it for school, it will not help you out. Very limited science and medicine vocabulary. Invest your money on a more advance system."
3,Good for the cost.,"For the price it's OK. Good for kids who have shown an interest in learning Spanish. The sound quality is poor but it has text so you can figure it out. It has way too many features which makes it more difficult to negotiate basic features. Consider the price, keep your expectations reasonable, and you won't be disappointed."
4,It DOES work! Here's HOW!,"This product is a good one for the beginning Spanish learner --- once you figure it out! The directions that come with the device are terrible, and the operation was not intuitive for me. However, once you know what to do, it is easy and works the way we all want it to. I called Franklin directly to find out the proper procedure.* This device will SPEAK the word that is HIGHLIGHTED on the screen *1. Type the word you want to learn in the language you know.2. Hit ""Enter"".3. Wait for the translation to appear on screen.4. Hit ""Enter"" again. This will highlight the word you typed.5. Now, use the arrow button to MOVE THE HIGHLIGHTING down to the translated word.6. Once the translation is highlighted, hit ""Speak"" and it will say the word out loud for you with proper pronunciation!I hope this helps."
2,electronic dictionary,product is good but a lot of words are not included which makes it unreliable source of information
2,I expected more,"I guess I expected a Spanish/English translation dictionary. I typed SIR, MISTER, LOVER,and got no translation into Spanish for any of those words. Save your money, and don't buythis product. Maybe other more expensive products are better, I am not going to find out.Anyway, for translations of most languages, I recommend you goto Google for translationsof words and also phrases, it is much much more superior than this device, with the addedbonus that Google translations are free."
2,Not What I Expected,"This device did not work according to how it was advertised. The words I put in for translation, were not compatible with what was in this device. Very simple words were not translated for me. This thing disappointed me very much."
3,Not very useful,"My daughter is in 2nd grade of school and I bought it for her, but I'm not using this product because I can't find a lot of words or terms.Probably I need to buy another model a little bit more sophisticated."
4,Almost as good as the first one...,"I love the idea of these books and have chosen many books to read by reading the very cool summaries in this one. I don't think it has as many good story options as the first one, but it's still very neat. I've never read it in the bathroom, but by my enjoyment of it off the commode I'm sure it would definitely live up to it's name."
4,A Real Gunslinger,"If you enjoy a good western, does it get any better than Louis L'Amour? The man knows his cattle, saloons, cowpokes, and gunslingers, and ol' Hopalong is definitely a 'slinger.L'Amour books are classics - in the western sense - and this one doesn't disappoint at all. It's certainly not the type of book that you'll need to find the corresponding Cliffs Notes in order to understand what's going on, but it's still enjoyable, entertaining, and classic. Appreciate this book for what's it is: a wonderful piece of western literature that makes for a light and fun read."
5,"Another good read, really enjoyed this one. Thanks",Louis continues to provide great cover to cover reading. Rustlers was just another in a long lin of great western novels.
1,Chain smoking book seller,"The book stunk through the mailbox!!! I had to keep it out in the garage. I hope it airs out before next year. I'd be embarassed to carry it in public. The seller must smoke 24 hours a day, and blow all that smoke into the books they sell."
1,Planters Peanut Candy Bar,Shipping was not revealed until after credit card information was completed and then the shipping fee was considerably higher than other offers for this product. Shipping fees should be mentioned on final invoice BEFORE payment information is given.
4,No Surprises,"These are exactly what you expect from Planters, great quality with great flavor bar after bar. You just can't get better anywhere."
5,The best candy,"I have always loved these bars, and they are hard to find in stores now. These came fresh and delicious."
3,NOT FOR ALL TASTES,"The main character, Giles De'Ath, reminds me of the prissy, rich uncle played by Clifton Webb in the original film version of W. Somerset Maugham's ""The Razor's Edge"": hilarious on short acquaintence, but likely to prove tiresome in the long, as De'ath proved to be, at least to my mind. I'm adding isolated eccentrics to my list of those, like drunks and crazy people, whom I feel make uninteresting protagonists."
3,"Best ""album title"", but weakest overall out of 3 I've heard","Sort of groovy electronica loops with a gritty base track. There are a couple really good songs, but there's something a little different about this one. Quite a few of the songs, like ""Thin Brown Layer"", the guitar playing sounds great but the DJ Shadow/Beck sounding loops make the track overall sound ""electronica"" rather than ""funky."" The collaborations are definitely worth skipping. Somehow doesn't seem to fit the sound when there's vocals on any of his albums.Return of the Bastard is a much better albium."
3,Whoa what!?,"Wow, maybe it's just me, but this album is not that great at all. The production, although it may have been good by the late 80s/early 90s standards, is flat out bad, and Eric Sermon, who raps more than half of the time, is just a TERRIBLE rapper. Sure, he had a few funny lines, but its hard to laugh when you can't understand what hes saying because his lisp is so bad. I give it 3 stars strictly out of respect, because I understand that these guys are rap pioneers, but if I wanted to listen to good rap music, I would look elsewhere."
5,Rappers learn your History before you touch it!!!!,"EXCELLENT!! This is a classic to this day, but this is when hip hop really meant something. Still love hip hop, but we may never ever see this again.."
5,nice set of wheels,"Gave as a gift to our daughter. She says she loves it. Makes going to the mall with the girls a breeze (well, almost). I'm sure she would highly recommend it to all."
3,OK Stroller,"This product is great for the price and for allowing your toddler to be a big kid riding on the back, having more freedom and clicking your new baby or younger child in the front seat. But...it is horrible to push and control! The handle bar should definitely be wider so you could control it better because it is kind of long and awkward."
2,Not my first choice,"These utensils are NOT the first ones I grab out of the drawer for my son, age 2. Yes, he likes the Cars characters, but the fork tines are too blunted to be used for what one uses a fork for.......stabbing food. The spoon is also pretty useless as the bowl is quite flat. All in all, I pretty much just give him these utensils for fun when he has finger food, since they are useless at picking up anything."
3,Fairly good,"For what I paid for them, I guess they are fine...I just expected a better quality for a disney product."
4,My son loves these!!,"My son is 19 months old and loves Mickey mouse, these definitely met our expectations!! They are built pretty sturdy for the price too"
4,Pleased,"From the picture, I thought I was getting both a Minnie Mouse fork and spoon, but when the package arrived, it was a Minnie Mouse spoon and a Mickey Mouse fork. A little disappointed, but my daughter didn't notice."
3,Paint Comes Off,"My 1 1/2 year old daughter received this set as a Christmas gift. After reading a review on the 4 piece set where the paint was coming off, I was extra careful not to run these through the washer. Unfortunately I accidentally did, and sure enough, some paint came off. I made a point to hand wash after that incident, and recommend you do the same.My daughter absolutely loves the Minnie fork, and asks for her at every meal (not sure if this is good or bad). We've had the set for only 1 month. With daily use and hand washing, about 25% of the paint is gone.Note that there are different versions of the set. The one we got has Mickey on the spoon. If I reordered, I'd get Minnie on both. She doesn't get as excited about Mickey as she does Minnie. And yes, the spoon is very shallow. It's okay for scooping solids, but can get a little messy with any liquids (soup/applesauce). While the set is not perfect, it's still fun and worth buying at least once."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"I bought 3 sets of these...mainly because I wanted more metal forks, but the spoons are great too. I had bought several plastic ""sporks"" that were just terrible and only had one metal fork so I wanted more. My son is 16 months old and with these metal forks he can stab at food by himself and most times is successful without any help. I actually am glad I got the spoons now too (I orginally was looking for just forks but those dont' come by themselves too often). We have the gerber baby spoons and those are too small now, so I got the gerber toddler spoons (that still have the soft silocone over the metal) and those are a bit big for his mouth, but we were making do. These are the perfect size for his mouth and they're practically flat, so it's easy for him to use (with applesauce and stuff...soup would be another story). We also have some plastic spoons that are deeper and he can never get all the food out of them. So these get a thumbs up all around."
2,Disney Princess Easy Grasp Flatware,I ordered three sets of the Disney Princess Flatware. I had lost a spoon to the set that I already had. They were replacements for my three year old granddaughter as she loved them. One of the sets matched the picture and is the same style as I am replacing. The other two are for a much younger child with very fat handles. False advertising. They were not what was pictured or that I ordered or wanted. What can I do about getting the right sets? The flatware is very nice but just be careful that you get the style that you want.
5,Mostly pleased with the item,"I received the book a couple of days ago, which was within the amount of time the company promised. The product is in pristine condition. I have no complaint, except that I wish that I could have received it earlier than I did."
1,rubbish....,this is an appalling squawky third rate Prince rip off - no wonder it bombed in the UK. horrible stuff to be avoided at all costs.
5,Brillant!,"Knowing that we will be leaving England soon, I am frantically searching for ""My Hero"" on DVD to watch in America. Hilarious. Classic.Brillant. Such a clever show. A cross between Mork and Mindy and Superman, this show is a must for all comedy fans."
4,First season is a good place to start,The first season introduces Thermo-man and all the characters. A light hearted comedy that grows on you.
3,George and Janet,"This is kind of a stupid comic book parody of Superman done in the BBC style. Some of the jokes are funny, and some fall flat on their faces. Kind of a mixed result."
1,My Hero?,"As is the case with so many sitcoms, My Hero started slowly and awkwardly. I loved this show in its later series, but Series One is a dud. If you are unsure whether or not this is the My Hero volume you want, consider that PBS rarely shows a series in order. My recommendation is to wait, I know this show gets better."
4,My Hero - Season 1,The younger priest from Father Ted is at again. This time as Thermo man. A very funny bit about men with super human powers meeting every day life. Such as falling in love and haveing kids.
5,Lots of chuckling,"I picked this up based on some of the reviews I got here. I have to say that it's been a lot of joy, but some small tears.The joy is from the program. It's your typical fish-out-of-water premise that shares a lot with 'Mork and Mindy' or 'My Favorite Martian'. The fact that it's wrapped with a comic book concept is used well, but it's the cast that pulls it off. Everyone on the show is a delight and each have wonderful qualities that run from the wacky to the stoned!The sadness around this show is that you only get 6 episodes on the single DVD. I found myself instantly wanting to order the remaining seasons, only to be thwarted by their unavailability. DARN!"
5,Great show. Now let's have some more seasons.,It's really great finally having this show available on DVD. Now we just need them to release more seasons.
4,Cheeky & Fun,"It's that simple. The premise alone is funny -- a superhero trying to live with a human. Think Mork & Mindy, British style. It's no Friends or Seinfeld, but a fun light-hearted romp for 30 minutes (1 episode) out of your day. Originally caught the show on BBC America -- it just made me laugh. The accents are thick -- so if you're not a fan of Brit humor -- this may not be for you."
4,Extremely Funny,"It's a sitcom about a superhero, and it's quite good. I don't know any background, I haven't seen the second season, I live in Thailand. I just happened to take a chance on the DVD, which contains 3 very funny hours. I plan to put this in my little pile of DVDs to watch again, and that's really all any DVD can ask of me."
5,Just two questions,"After reading this book, the only two relevant questions remaining for the Clintons and their minders should be:Cigarrette?Blindfold?Those who voted, cheered, and applauded this pack of traitors into office share a portion of the complicity for the betrayal of our nation."
1,Gertz's Grim Fairy Tale,"Bill Gertz weaves a tall tale for Clinton-haters, trotting out the old favorites: evil Ruskies, evil Chinese, etc., and he gives these people what they want: a calculatedly deceptive and improbable yarn. The only proven chicanery here is that Bill Gertz is going to get some money for this right-wing fairy tale. But that's not the point here, is it? Highly recommended as bedtime reading for right-wing zealots--191 pages of sour grapes (remember to put the light out, bonzo)."
1,A Book for Idiots By An Idiot,"Gertz's allegations about Clinton's complicity in allowing China to steal nuclear secrets have been completely disproven by a new report by a nonpartisan group at Stanford University. The book is still good toilet tissue for that next camping trip, though."
2,Where was the editor?,"Bill Gertz book has a lot of very damning evidence that the Clinton administration has severely reduced U.S. security in a variety of areas. However the material is very badly organized.This volume deserves some severe editing. It appears to be a compilation of newspaper articles thrown together in a mishmosh of facts.Good information, but a pretty bad read."
3,Too subjective to believe,I can't believe this kind of story. History will prove whether Gertz is right.
1,Don't Bother,"I was lured into starting this book when, scanning rapidly, I mistook the author as a writer for the Washington Post rather than the Washington Times. That impression was quickly erased when I saw a dedication to the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and his wife on the acknowledgements page. The rest was all too predictable. I finished it out of morbid curiosity.Don't waste your time. Any truthful content that this book might contain is hopelessly obscured by the strident tone, reckless accusations, and obvious bias."
1,Just more of the same nonsense,"After reading this book, and others of its ilk, it's clear to me that the author and those like him have tapped into a profitable market of Clinton-haters. The author's allegations, half-truths and inuendo are largely unsupported and not credible. Has the author (or anybody else) asked himself, ""what does Clinton have to gain by committing treasonous acts like those described"" and why would the cabinet, including a Republican Def Secy, and the Joint Chiefs not stand up to such acts?The only thing more disturbing than reading the book was reading the reviews of the other right wing nuts."
3,"Factual, if somewhat dry, analysis","While Betrayal is not the most exciting political book that has been written, it is still worth reading. Gertz backs up his accusations with solid documentation and expert testimony. This is a book for any concerned citizen, regardless of his political persuasion."
4,Clinton beats Harding as most embarrassing in History,"With example after example, Gertz makes a compelling case for treason against Clinton and Gore. It is terrifying to think that our own government is providing the weapons technology that will threaten our children."
4,Appalling revelations!,"I was stunned by what I read in this powerful expose of the Clinton Administration. It is depressing to think of what our leadership has done to us. It was especially painful to read this BETRAYAL after I'd just read a very uplifting, inspiring novel about American heroism in World War II, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY. If our finest hour was our global victory over fascist tyranny in the Second World War, our darkest hour has been our suffering under Bill Clinton's lying years in office."
4,A Major Book!,"As Washington DC insiders know, Gertz has been a dead-on reliable source of information about the nation's most closely guarded secrets for years. He has broken more major stories in 1998-99 than most celebrity journalists report in a career. But because he is with ""Washington's other paper"" he is increasingly tagged as ""right wing"" by those he has exposed and/or embarrassed. No doubt a serious spin campaign is under way to marginalize this book. Notice that the facts of the book are never contradicted -- only the author gets smeared. That Betrayal has been #1 on the Amazon list since the moment is remarkable -- and unspinnable. This is an important book and frightening one. Like ""The Silent Spring"" it won't go away. This is destined to be a turn of the century classic. Read it now before the White House kulturesmog obscures it."
5,Betrayal: How the Clinton Administration Undermined American,"This is regarding the review immediately below left on July 11, 2001 by ""Don't Bother"" (no name given). Don't bother has a problem with honesty. This book's author is in fact a reporter for the Washington Times (NOT the more conservative Washington Post) and the book's dedication is to Debra (NOT Rev, Moon). If you don't like the book, you don't like the book, but don't try to discredit the author by falsely painting him as a strident conservative. Read the book and look at the documented facts minus the spin."
1,Right-wing Garbage,I read this book and all it does is spew the same right-wing garbage the intolerant right has been spewing without one IOTA of real evidence.This book like all the other outrages scandals the right as accused the President of committing is just another ploy in their attempt to dirty the Democratic party in the next election.
1,Garbage and Spew...save your money,"Save your money and tune in to Limbaugh if you're interested in this kind of garbage and spew. Unsubstantiated allegations, rumours and outright hatred do not make for good investigative ""journalism"".Take a look at the reviews written prior...how many people have said something to the effect of ""if even a portion of this is true...""Well, I doubt that much of it is. It's an interesting read, but be sure to file it under ""speculative fiction"". The truth may be out there, but it sure isn't in here."
1,Written For Dollars. . Not For Truth,"A shameful, poorly investigated book of allegations, innuendo, hearsay and an implicit hatred of Bill Clinton and his cothinkers for their brave stand against the neoconsertative menace to America. Read it, but do so critically and realize it is part of an orchestrated attempt to undermine American democracy and social equity."
5,Caused a Five Star Smile!,"We bought this DVD for my mother-in-law as a Christmas present. This guy is sort of a modern, European Lawrence Welk. Made her smile from ear to ear, and that is worth five stars any day!"
5,Fantastic,"I just recently discovered Andre Rieu's music and have been totally captivated by his music and his musicians. What a way to bring light, beautiful classical music to the people in every continent. I strongly recommend this dvd to anyone who appreciates beautiful music played by multi talented beautiful people."
2,Don't speak Dutch,Since I don't speak dutch I couldn't understand most of what they were singing. the subtitles were sporadic at best. Even though the packaging was in English only one song was sung in English. Everybody looked like they were having a good time.
5,happy listening,The Best Andre Rieu concert which is saying a lot because all of the ones we have are fantastic.
5,Homecoming,Andre Rieu is an excellent entertainer. Very pleasing to watch and listen to. The Homecoming is an excellent concert with the same pageantry all of Rieu's concerts exhibit.
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Another of Andre Rieu's great hits. The music, singers, orchestra, are simply great. Love them."
5,"Benny Neyynan, hero tenor, steals the show.","None of your readers mentioned BENNY NEYMAN, who appears as the mystery guest on this magnifient DVD.Benny is an aging (but gracefully) 56 year old tenor, a Dutch hero and very famous especialy in hs hometown of Maastricht where this DVD was recorded. Benny is a cross between Frank Sinatra/ Julio Iglesias and Charles Aznevour. at all stages of his career. He is still doing concerts all over Europe. I am an 80 year old grandmother and this composer/singer really turns me on. This DVD is worth buying for Benny's 10 minutes alone but the whole concert is en enthusiastic beautiful version of life, Maastricht style with huge audience participation and an international treat. Andre Rieu brings so much joy to his music. I commend him and all of his DVD's. Bettie Magee Natick, Massachusetts, USA"
5,Andre Rieu - The Homecoming,"Enjoyable. Full of music that was well selected, well played and well sung."
5,"Highway Patrol, the TV series",I watched this series as a kid in the 1950's and have been searching for it on Amazon for years. Why hasn't it been released on DVD yet. What is the problem? Are they waiting until all who remember it are dead?
3,Disappointed,"Small print made it hard to read; some things were left out,such as:said that it may harm plants and it was not good for shrimp; fresh water lobsters. My tank is all fresh water plants and shrimp! I spent a little more than $2+ for the product and the shipping bouced the cost to over $11.00. I ordered it without looking at the shipping...BIG MISTAKE! I contacted the company and ask if they could lower the shipping price and they could not. The bottle was the size of an eye dropper medicine. Maybe 3/4 oz.. Will not do that again. Shipping has to be watched...you think you are getting a great deal an BAM! Shipping takes that away."
5,The SAP Consultant Handbook,Our company choose to convert the operating system that we have used for 20+ years and I found myself needing more information about this system. This book gave me a great deal of insight in the workings of the SAP program and how to use all the tools that are built into it. I have offered advice to individuals who are being trained to teach this program and it has helped tremendously. I would recommend this handbook to anyone preparing to adapt SAP into there manufacturing enviroment. Just a note that the SAP consultants that were brought in to assist in starting this program here are making $85.00 an hour.
5,Best flavor,"I have been buying nutritional yeast in our local co-ops bulk bins for years. I wasn't happy that it didn't contain the vit B-12. I decided to give Bob's Mill a try and it is so delicious! The flavor is very cheesy plus has the B-12. We have already gone through 2 bags. Put it on baked potatoes, popcorn, steamed veggies..etc. Works great in dips, makes great cheese sauces. Best ever! I'll never buy any other brand again. This is the first time I have bought any type of food item from amazon and have been very happy,fast shipping. I am also happy I placed this item on auto shipping."
5,Excellent Nutritional Yeast,"Bob's delivered asap, and the packaging makes it really easy to store some in the freezer. Thanks for making your product available on-line. I live in a small town in Texas, and just can't find nut. yeast in the stores."
5,"Sturdy Packaging, neatly bagged, large flake is preferred","I have only just received this product, as I had it delivered to a friend in Texas, who later brought it to me.All I can say is, it looks like a typically high quality Bob's Red Mill Product. We do prefer the large flake nutritional yeast such as this.Say! I'll go now and open a bag and taste it, so i can tell you how we like it.<goes> </returns>It's absolutely delicious, a nutty, almost toasted flavor, eaten straight. We are going to use some on our breakfast Bob's Red Mill Organic Yellow Corn Grits.Recommended."
5,eat it every day,"When I was researching how to increase my potassium intake, I came across thisproduct. It is also rich in vitamin Bs. I put it in my oatmeal everyday. The Bob's mills products are varied and many of them are organic so I like using them and you get a great price on amazon."
5,Not for beginners....,"Cleary, as ever, does a marvelous job of translating with clarity without imposing an agenda.Chih-hsu Ou-i set himself the task of interpreting the I Ching in terms of a political manual, a Taoist/Confucionist text, and a Buddhist primer. His interpretations are by turns insightful, obtuse, poetic, tendentious, and mind-bending. When he succeeds, he does so quite gloriously. When he fails... oh, dear...Nevertheless, for experienced students if the I Ching and Chinese developments in Buddhism, this is a text worth owning."
3,Difficult marriage,"The marriage of taoist principles with buddhist philosophy is most cumbersome. These are very different worlds. There have been many attempts to marry both worlds in the past, since the advent of Buddhism in China, but they have never led to a real fusion otherwise only one of these two philosophical currents would have survived. And both are still alive..."
5,express your self,this book helped me begin journaling. its a jump beginning for all ages between 8-15 years old. still loved it.
5,Excelletn Putchase,"This DVD shows you what Hardcore really is, crazy fans and a band that really loves its fans. Great DVD to have, jus full of power that makes you want to jump a mosh. You have to have this DVD."
5,Pure Energy,"This video is strong from an upbeat beginning to a extremely brutal ending. Definitely my favorite live video I've ever watched. I would recommend it to anyone who listens to this band, it captures their essence perfectly."
3,GREAT SHOW !!!,"These guys can put out a hell of a show. Main feature is almost 80'of brain-damaging metallic hardcore, the picture is incredible despite the 1000mph. multi-camera MTVesque editing !!! But the sound has some problems; it's tonally correct -esp the bottom end which is awesome- but the singer is too loud in the mix and guitars should sound brighter like on their videos. Instead they sound lower and crunchier, and the lead guitarrist sounds a lot louder on the right channel than the other guy who sounds on the left one, which causes a volume imbalance that forced me to switch it to mono to avoid getting deaf on one ear.There are tons of extras like 8 songs live at Harpo's, all of their videos and a lot more. Recommended but it would be a 5 stars were it not for the sound issues."
4,"Nice watch, great price, bad service (not Amazon's fault i guess)","i saw this watch on a japanese fashion mag in Jan and immediately searched it online and got it on amazon with this great discount price. Been getting lots of attention BUT the clasp somehow loosened and watch fell, cost me like 90 bux to fix the clasp. Gucci store refused to service cuz it wasn't purchased at the store. I guess that's the expected expense saved from the discount!"
5,Sepultura at his best!!!,"I bought this double CD three monts ago with no big expectations; ""Roots"" was a so-so album with weak lyrics and poor production efforts compared to ""Chaos AD"" and ""Arise"", of course. When a friend of mine told me that U.A.P.G.S. was mainly based on the Roots album I hesitated a little but listened to it any ways... boy, was I wrong!. This is THE BEST Sepultura album with Max Cavalera and I don't think they could ever regain that kind of power again. If you're a Sepultura fan this is a ""must have"" album!!"
5,A time capsule of one of metal's most legendary bands,"""Under a Pale Grey Sky"" captures Sepultura's last performance with original vocalist Max Cavalera (before he founded Soulfly) and serves as a time capsule of one of metal's most legendary and influential bands. This massive two disc set sports a near flawless track listing of fan favorite songs and the sound quality is pretty good as well, but towards the end of Disc 2, as a previous reviewer stated, Max's voice really starts to go and it can become a bit grating. Other than that, ""Under a Pale Grey Sky"" is a great live compilation of the legendary Brazilian thrash metal band, and even though this is a live album it is an essential purchase for fans of the band new and old."
4,Applied Animal Reproduction,Was a very good book for those with iterest on how repoduction in animals works. The first chapters help to better understand the book rather then assuming that everyone knows all the tec. terms.
2,Not edited,"It seems as though Kaplan decided to skip the editing for Math. I have found almost one mistake in every two pages.Even in English, they are trying to teach you but are making grammatical errors themselves. Definitely not recommended. I've always relied on Kaplan, but this edition is ridiculous; waste of money."
1,Completely Horrible,"I have never seen so many vital mistakes in a book which is so important. For starters, there are mistakes in the decimal placements in the math answers, constant contradictions in the reading sections, and horrible essay examples- with more typos than I can count, even in the ""Perfect 6"" essays- in the essay portions. And that doesnt even begin to explain how poorly organized this book is. The topics are so jumbled around that it's impossible to get a good review on topics that you actually want to study.In short, DO NOT BUY. Get CollegeBoard's SAT study book instead."
5,For Kaitlyn,I have probably seen this movie 20 times now and it is such an awesome experience to let my daughter watch the movies that she wants to watch and throw her a head set and then she can be in her own little movie theater with out making me watch it. Yeah Love you Amazon (Kindle Fire)
5,The Waiting Child: How the Faith and Love of One Orphan SavL,"Cindy Champnella writes on her dedication page, ""For Jaclyn....my light, my love, my sorrow, my joy....my child."" Thus begins the most beautiful story you will ever read. It's the story of 4 year old Jaclyn, adopted from a Chinese orphanage, and her never-ending determination and yearning to bring home the 2 year old boy she loved and ""mothered"" there. I have known Cindy for a number of years now, and have known the story of Jaclyn and Lee. Yet reading this incredible story in its entirity was so moving I couldn't put it down. Being an adoptive Mom myself, I was very glad to read Cindy's truthful tale of adoption...tremendous joys coupled with moments of raw grief. This is a must-read for anyone who loves children, and is willing to be inspired by the love of a 4 year old, and inspired by her parents who dared to believe that dreams really can come true."
1,disappointing and trite,What I expected to be a charming and informative story was a huge disappointment. The writer seems on a mission and incapable of being objective in what is supposed to be a true story but smacks of pure sap and fiction. Don't waste your time or your money.
5,Great book for anyone!,This book isn't just for those who adopt children from China. It's for anyone wanting a story about what it means to be part of a family. It's a gentle reminder that a dream is only a dream until it has a true believer and a plan to put it in motion.
3,"Interesting, but a bit preachy","I was drawn to this story because I adopted from China. All through the read, which was a quick one, I wished to author had relayed more of her duaghter's story. I grew tired of the hearing over and over the requests for Xiao Mei Mei and the alluded to only recollections of life in the orphanage. The author states in the beginning how amazed she was that her daughter remembered so much of those years and of her birth family, yet we don't get a chance to hear that part of the story or more about the details of their trips to China. The whole decision to allow Xiao Mei Mei to be adopted by the author's sister is so glossed over and then you jump immediately to the celebration dinner where Jaclyn is told Xiao Mei Mei is coming. To little detail and much to much mush for me."
4,"A ""wet dream"" personified","...I paid a small fortune for this book only to read about the perfect vacation.It is a photographer's dream come true and a fine insight to an area that I will (someday) be able to fly fish.I'd buy another copy because of the sheer glory of the story, the binding and the (prior to GM) story of travel in the finest engineered car ever built.If you have the $$$ buy it. Like Garrison Keillor, Mr. Swanson lives his dreams. Too few of us ever do."
2,not my pick,"They are not the pick of the litter for what I would choose from that era. Barry Williams and I have different taste in music. Some was okay, but most was not the station I would have tuned into."
2,Steam Trains of Great Britain,"Just like all the rest, nothing much new too me :o( buy it if you see it for sale at $5, DONT pay what I did :o( :o( :o("
5,Great Way to Learn Russian!,I have learned now how to speak Russian and have inspired friends to do the same. My church is preparing for a mission trip soon and I feel fairly confident that I can get where I need to get in Moscow or at least ask directions. The tapes are very well-paced and I highly recommend them.
5,No dropped connections,"You pay more, but you also get a better connection. I threw away my cheap Linksys USB wireless adapter, which always would drop the connection, and bought this gem. No more drop connections."
4,Installed & Connected,"Bought this for an older XP desktop upstairs. Little confusion from Quick Start Guide and Installation Manual. Quick Start says to install PCI card before drivers, Install Manual says the opposite, but I figured it all out. Then trying to find my network was a little exploration, but you have to use the D-Link Client, not Windows. All in all, it works, signal's strong and no wires to snake downstairs. Just wonder what'll happen if I replace desktop with a Vista machine."
5,Norwegian: Pimsleur Language Program,"This program is the only place to start if you want to learn Norwegian. It provides you with the basics needed to speak a foreign language. The speakers are easy to understand and speak slow enough that you can hear each word. You will quickly progress through each unit. The program does not allow you to forget previous lessons, so you actually retain what you learned.I have purchased several other programs over the years, and was not able to learn from them. I wish Pimsleur was available back then. Invest your money wisely, start with the Pimsleur programs. They are expensive, but they work. The proof: the Norwegians actually understood me when I spoke.The main drawback with this product is that there is not a lot of information in the program. It will not provide you with enough phrases to get by as a tourist, so you will need additional material.Now if Pimsleur would only produce a more comprehensive version. I am impatiently waiting."
2,ikke bra,"I didn't get much out of it. I could do all of the lessons fairly easily, but I thought that the man and the woman sounded quite different in their pronunciations, so I struggled with what the actual words were. If I ever want to have a glass of beer at the Theater Cafe on Parliament Street, I've got it knocked. I don't think each lesson was really a whole half hour. I'm taking lessons from a teacher now."
2,Norwegian CDs,"Why is the very first thing they teach you is ""I speak Norwegian"". After learning that, you can't speak another word. Should start with ""where is the bathroom"" or something useful. I would prefer a text to go with it to help with the pronunciation. It is difficult to fine tune the exact sound. Maybe I need a better sound system , but I had a lot of difficulty with it."
1,Caution - Information in production description is misleading.,Product did not fit my camera even though the description stated that it would. I sent it back for a full refund.
4,Well done.,"The book presents the prospect of praying the Psalms in the context of a deep ""reading"" of the psalms. I found it to be a responsible and thoughtful approach far superior to memorizing phrases."
5,Satisfied customer,"I was happy to find this product as I can no longer find it in stores. It was a great price, and shipped fast."
3,Alright,"Gives off a citrus/spicy smell that doesn't last very long. Not bad by any means, but it doesn't stand out at all. At least it's cheap."
2,Doesn't share the same scent as their hair products,"I bought assuming it would smell similar to their classic hair product lines as I really love the smell of their pomade, shampoo, body wash, etc. If that's what your expecting, this product isn't for you as it has a totally different scent. As a fragrance in it own it was nothing special and a little strong for my taste."
5,Psycho Skate,"One of the best 1980's skateboarding videos ever made -PSYCHO SKATE!This VHS video features tons of rare footage of guys like Tony Hawk, Christian Hosoi, Rodney Mullen, Gator, Mark Gonzales, and many more of the late 1980's biggest stars. Running time is about 1 hour.Movie description:Join skateboarding cult figure ""Psycho Man"" as he takes an exciting look at America's fastest growing sport. You'll see top skateboarders like Gator, Hosoi, Hawk, and Mullen as they each shred the streets, catch max air out of the vertical half pipe and perform freestyle maneuvers.DetailsSound: Stereo Sound,"
5,"""Homer's Place"" a Winner","My wife and I read a lot of fiction from well-known authors and rate Harlan Koch's ""Homer's Place"" with the best of them. Not only does the story depict a special time and place in our country but does so with an entertaining, humorous and heartwarming style. We highly recommend it."
5,Homer's Place,"I just finished reading Homer's Place. I must say that it was fantastic! I simply could not put it down once I started. The only other books I have read that were in this category of interest to me were by Mark Twain. Harlen Koch told a great American story in such a way that even the great master of American Literature would have been much satisfied with. Quite simply, I loved the book."
5,Homer's Place Good Reading,"The prologue sets the tone for this poignant story. The writing is excellent. It is a story of growing up, seen through the observant eyes of a boy, Tom Cable, from about age 8 till adulthood. Times were definitely different in the 1930s. Very enjoyable reading. It is the kind of book that makes an excellent movie. The characters are well developed. I recommend Homer's Place wholeheartedly."
3,HIT AND MISS MENAGERiE,"Writers like to write, some profusely, others pithily. But when constrained to three minutes, sans editors or their own self-editing,their mini-speeches show a whole new side to well-known writers. This book is all ups ands and down. Some clever, some confusedand wandering. Best you use Amazon's Look Inside Feature to sample these ninety-second wonders or wanderers.Nice spread of top talents though; you might like to read the candid thoughts of writing celebs, focussed or consciously rapids-streamed. For my taste (and these are real subjective nuggets) there are more ups and downs. This I'd call one-time-throughreading. (And yes, no power on earth could stop some writers from running over their three minutes. Now, this isn't chauvinistic,but this seemingly holds truest for women writers.)"
5,YOU will not regret buying this frame!,"This arrived in lighting fast time, shrink wrapped and in perfect condition. Mind you, I am a woman and am not handy with tools or building stuff. However, this assembly of a queen size was easy. I just purchased a new queen PedicSolutions 10 inch memory foam mattress from QVC and the frame paired P-E-R-F-E-C-T-L-Y together. This frame is sturdy, no movement, no squeaks, simply A+++++ fabulous all the way around. The wood needed no sanding, was smooth and clean to the touch. I am very impressed indeed and the cost, even more impressive. QUALITY at its best and made in the U.S.A. Thanks ever so much! I am a VERY-VERY Happy Customer and recommend this product without any reservation."
4,"Good Frame for the Price, Fast Delivery","This queen size frame is tulip poplar and so the wood is very light as shown in the picture.The Pros:No damaged woodEverything fit including the mattress on the frameNo warped piecesThe slats are nice and thick so you won't worry about them breaking.Very solid when bolted togetherFast & easy assemblyConsSlight ridging on the wood from the planer, thus best results will be obtained by sanding for a smooth finish. I used a vibrating sander and 220 grit to smooth it out. Then three coats of handrubbed polyurethane satin finish.Even though generally light Poplar can still have wide variety in the natural color of the wood, thus staining the wood can help achieve uniformity of color if desired.I used a maple stain to add just a touch of color to the wood.The headboard may not be that much higher than some of the newer mattresses.Overall a solid value bedframe and one that if taken care of should last for years and years."
2,Bettlesnorx!,I really dont like the Bettlesnorx but the Bettleborgs Metallix video was better.They had cooler out fits and swords but like I said I dont like the Beetlesnorx and Id much rather watch Teletubbies than these dumb @ss movies!
2,Beetle Borgs Curse of the Shadow Borg Mini Series,I want to know what it looked like when Josh carried Heather to the Hospital I think Heather is in love with Josh I want to see them kiss while Josh has Heather in his arm I think if they realy love each other Josh should carry Heather in his two arms where ever he goes forever and kiss her on the lipps every day holding Heather in his arms forever.
2,Vitsie will eat your soul,"Someone gave this to my brother and me when we were kids. Vitsie was alternately TERRIFYING or creepy or bizarre or all three.However, later on, it because a source of major hilarity, and we'd watch it, laughing so hard we were crying. So I gave it an extra star."
4,Was a hit,We bought this for my boyfriend's 4 1/2 year old grandson. At first he didn't seem too interested in it since he didn't know what it was but once we opened it and set it up and showed him how to play the game then he started having fun with it. Even the 3 year old brother and some of us 'older' folks got involved playing with it. We liked that it was for both indoor and outdoor use and that it had a baseball theme since his grandson is definitely into baseball. This made it more fun for him to hit the ball through the legs of the different baseball figures instead of just the normal hoops that we all remember growing up with.
1,REALLY AWFUL!,"This gum melts in your mouth! It does not stay together to form chewing gum, it melted like a mint. I will never buy this awful gum again!"
1,SteeviaDent put a dent in my wallet,"The gum was truly tasteless and very pricy. I appreciate that there is a product with Steevia and not ""the other"" but it's horrible. The taste is gone in one minute!"
4,Cool,Still lost. The good things about this video is the Black Gears are introduced and the really cool part in the factory.
2,Sucks,"Well,let's face it,Digimon has a nothing to do love song,and they released it so it could beat pokemon in the ratings here in USA,they made the same attempt with spider man unlimited,and grow up,this cartoon is a cheap copy of pokemon,when the digimon talk they just say something stupid like there's the bad guy.Even if the story is entertaining,Pokemon solve it in continuity,like when charizard wouldn't obey ash,it took him almost a season for him to be obedient,and when Greymon evolved into skullgreymon,it evolved back to that stupid baby form,and pokemon evolve correctly,so overall digimon is a paper wasting cartoon with stupid plots like those symbols that they find accidentaly,at least pokemon do not die and turn into eggs,like come on........"
5,My Opinion,"Well to say the truth I like Digimon. My friends all think I'm weird but that's okay. They don't like Pokemon and neither do I BUT don't yell at me just 'cuase I don't like Pokemon. I'm not saying it's bad but it just doesn't suit me. Digimon is more realistic not for the little monsters that run around saving the world but because of the characters. They show feelings that people in real life have. Like anger, sadness, friendship, deppression and things like that make it all the more realistic. I like Matt the best because he is the most realistic one. He tries to hard at the beggining to be cool and is a bit of a jerk but he softens and changes in the end. A lot of people are like that. Many are like some of the others too. The reason I like this show is because it's so much more realistic than Pokemon."
3,"Okay, but the Japanese Version...","Okay, I'm a really big fan of Anime, but I think, that the Japanese Version of this is much better, this Anime is dubbed very well, but it could be dubbed better, they took out the good music (Jazz) and the Anime Series has lots more potenial."
3,"I have it, and it's okay","I'd say its okay. The ones wiht Kabuterimon and Togemon are kinda unusual. It's not all the time champions ""beat"" Ultimates. That's what confuses me. BUt I like the part in the Biyomon Digivolve one where Biyomon gets rolled down the hill with Meramon's fire ball. Not the rolling, but how Sora ""rescued"" Biyomon. In all these three episodes, I'd say ""Kabuterimon's Electro Shocker"" is the best. THe wierd thing is, I think about that is that Greymon and Garurumon together couldn't beat Andromon but Kabuterimon did with one single hit. It's true maybe some Digimon have advantages but this one? I'll have to think about that."
3,Worked ok,Used this to attach the trim in my BMW. It worked ok. It fell back down again. This does not have a lot of holding power.
4,Valuable history from one who was there,"The author of ""Before Their Time: A Memoir"" looks back at WWII from the perspective of 50 years and remembers. This is as excellent book, every bit as worthy of acclaim as Brokaw's The Greatest Generation"" or Rustad's ""The Triumph and the Glory""."
3,Portrait of the Author as a 19 year old Rifleman,"This is a strange book. The author later went on to write novels so it isn't too surprising that this book is not really a memoir but a psychoanalytic, stream of conciousness paean to the life shattering memory of the author's one and only day in combat. The last 50 pages or so describe his slow re-discovery of himself after the trauma. Do not expect a literal description of Army life or battle. While there are some stunningly concrete details in this book they are almost always used to anchor a mental state or emotion the author says he was feeling. I am somewhat skeptical of the ability to remember how one would have felt a half a century ago but then again I didn't live through World War Two. This book falls in the camp of ""Crossing the Sauer"" and ""Roll Me Over'. A work for meditation and introspection on memory. loss and World War II."
2,Disappointing,"Book was not what I thought it would be. I thought there would be more focus on the battlefield and what it was like. The author only had a very brief foray into battle and that was it. The rest of the book is tedium about training, complaints about military life, and what happened to him afterwards. This is not meant to disrespect the author at all. He should be very proud of his accomplishments and we should salute him as a patriot and a soldier. But his memoirs as a book was boring at best."
3,Good Read,"This is another book that I read only because I was made to in school. But I actualy enjoyed it. Kotlowitz has a great writting style. It gives you a good look into what war can be like.It doesn't have as much action as some people maybe anticipating though. It does have some thriling parts but its not action packed. None the less though it's a good book. If you have never read any books on war before I would reccomend this as introductory book to the topic. Even if it isn't your usual book topic, Kotlowitz writes well enough to keep you intrested."
2,Not good at all,This stuff is pretty much a waste of money. I don't know what it was supposed to do but it didn't soften or even detangle my hair. I got about half way through the bottle and decided to buy something else. This is now in the guest bathroom.
3,Valuable Information Cut,I agree with Josh's review. This book has been condensed quited a bit and a lot of valuable information and illustrations were cut out. I prefer the older book as well.
1,Worthless information,"I knew that bolts came in metric and english, but I dont have any way to measure A & B in my tool box. Do you think the seller ever looked at this site? What are dimensions of this product??"
2,"For the price, don't expect more","I was afraid the sunshade would have been weak and fall easily. I was right. For the price, you cannot ask more. But as a product, it's below the average."
3,Worth the price,"For the price, this product works as promised. Obviously it doesn't fit my windsheild perfectly, but it's also less than 1/3rd the price of the one that does. The elastic band that holds it folded together for storing broke after about one year. However it is still a metallic sunshade, which seems to do a MUCH better job at reflecting that sunlight than those old cardboard ones. If you're looking for a cheap (and therefore flimsy) metallic sunshade, then you've found your product."
5,Amazing,"Kowit's book invites you into the very soul of poetry, and suddenly you find yourself evoking the minuscule, corner-shadowed inhabitants of your subconscious ... all the specks of dust and the cobwebs. And they find themselves, reincarnate and illuminated, on paper. He gives you wonderful exercises that inspire you to try things you would never have thought of otherwise. I highly recommend this book."
4,Exploring poetry,This book helped me realize a hidden ability to express myself. Each chapter builds on the other to help a novice poet put something meaningful on paper and then share it with others.
2,"Fun series, but buyers beware!","Though I think I would enjoy this box set, I can foresee not too manypeople buying this one because of the half-season format. Which meansthat sales will be poor, thus subsequent seasons will not be released.This has happened to other shows. Buyers take heed!Studios can learn from this also."
1,You don't have to buy this,"This is not the First Season, it's only half of it. In my view this is an unbelievably bad decision because it dashed everybody's expectations and created resentment.I intended to buy the box as a birthday present for my roommate, who waited forever for this release, but we decided to teach the company a lesson: no full season release, no money. I rented the 12 episodes from Netflix, and I hope all of you do the same."
5,Whoo-Hoo! Finally It Happened...,"I have been waiting for what seems like longer than forever for The Love Boat to be released!All technical issues, what's included on the DVD, etc. placed to the side, I am just one happy camper to be able to watch this show again! I feel like I got a decent price for a boxed set and I've enjoyed every episode I've watched so far.Looking forward to purchasing many more episodes in the future!"
4,Welcome Aboard,"While watching this show ""way back when"", I dreamed of someday taking a cruise. That dream became a reality in 1991. I just went on my fourth one this year (2008). Anyway, I was so excited when the first season came out on DVD. It is so fun to watch. And oh, how we love to ""sing along!"" If you loved it then, you'll love it now! ""Welcome aboard, it's love..."""
1,OUTRAGED!,"Cheap, cheap and insulting! What an outrage. Well I for one REFUSE to purchase this HALF SET and will either buy a foreign release of the COMPLETE seasons or live without it on principle alone! OUTRAGEOUS!"
1,Great Show turns into Rip-Off DVD,"I loved The Love Boat growing up with all it's glamour and fantasies that made you want to book a Princess Cruise and fall in love! I was so excited to learn it was finally being released on DVD. That exciting soon turned to disappointment to find it was only half of the first season with absolutely NO EXTRAS! I mean, come on. A normal TV show DVD colection comes out in FULL SEASON and you can always get it for under $30 to start. So by the time the second half of this comes out we will have to pay $50 plus to get all of season one! Lets hope the following seasons come out in full. And there has to be bloopers, behind the scenes, etc somewhere to include. And can no one find any of the actors to do any kind of commentary??? BIG DISAPPOINMENT!"
5,I'm Pleased!,"Prior to last Friday evening, I read the reviews and thought I wouldn't buy the Season 1, Volume 1 because of half the episodes, but I have to tell you: I bought it and glad I did. Sure, I have to go back and buy the second half of the season, but I was in Love Boat heaven this weekend. I watched all 12 episodes back to back and enjoyed every minute of it!"
2,Hey Paramount what's the deal??,"Ok, so I guess 20th Century Fox sold the rights to this series to Paramount for dvd release. So, why oh why Paramount are you treating your customers this way? Realeasing only half of season one?? Have you a clue as to what consumers really want? And God only knows when you will decide to release seaon one, vol. 2 and how long it will take to release the rest of the 9 seasons this series ran. Where are the extras?? All you included was promos for each episode and not even a cast comentary on at least one or two episodes. Also why weren't the three pilots for this series included? I know the first two pilots did not include all of the regular cast but we still would have like to have seen them just to compare the charecters and the acting. I would hope you will include then on your next release."
4,good show,"i enjoyed the love boat when it first came out. the characters complimented one another really well. the Captain, Gopher Isacc the Bartender, the Doctor and Julie. the show was something that i always got into every saturday night back in the day. it was one of those shows that you just had to see who the weekly guest was gonna be.i enjoyed the first few seasons and this particular season got the Boat off and running.i always dug the Jack Jones sung theme song."
1,Disappointed with Paramount DVD Release,The public wants a COMPLETE DVD collection of Season 1 not half of anything that is overpriced. The Love Boat is part of the culture in TV shows and deserves to be released as a whole.
2,Love boat hit an iceberg,"I have been waiting for this to be released on dvd for many years and come to find out this was not the complete season for the price tag. Only 1/2 what were they thinking is it all about the money these days. This was just about 1 of the shows that i watched with my parents, I usually couldnt be in the same room with them. Anyways this 1/2 season has the regular crew : Captain Stubbing, Julie, Doc, Gopher and Issac ready to set sail with love aboard the big ship. I am only rating 2 stars because of not being a complete season for the price. I am disappointed on the whole thing but have been waiting many years. I will keep it. All aboard!After some thought apparently 12 episodes were made as being the 1st season as a test to see if the show would be a hit or not."
1,The Greedy Cruise . . . .,"We loved watching the Love Boat and we've have waited for years and years for it to finally come out on DVD. But for only half a season (a mere 12 episodes) after ALL that waiting. I hope it sinks real fast before it ever leaves port. Call it pure 101% GREED on behalf of the lame-brain studio execs who have no clue as to what the public wants, or what the public is willing to pay. Just read the majority of the other reviews of this DVD set. They ALL say the exact same thing.Sorry BUT NO THANKS guys. You can pack your bags and just sail on out to sea without us aboard.Blubb, blubb, blubb, blubbbbbbb . . . . . . ."
5,Great Memories,"I remember watching this on Sat nights, along with ""Fantasy Island"". This DVD brings great memories back. I love the format-you can watch each episode with it's ""Promo"", the short clip before the famous opening. I didn't remember how cheesey some of the stories were, but hey, it's a cruise ship and this show put cruising into the mainstream of America. Bravo! Looking forward to Season 2 and beyond."
2,I agree that this is a rip off.,"I am also a Northern Exposure fan and have purchased 5 of the 6 seasons of that show. When NE was first released on DVD the first season (which was a short replacement series) had less than 10 episodes. There was much outcry about that, too. Not long after seasons 1 & 2 were released together. Let's hope the ""Love Boat"" studios will re-think this greedy ploy and relase the whole season as it should be. I for one can wait."
1,no tolerance for 1/2 seasons,"There is no, absolutely no excuse for bringing out 1/2 season sets and charging full price. I will not buy 1/2 season sets unless I bought them from Amazon marketplace new for more or less $12.50each volume. I did that with ""Fall Guy"". I love the Love Boat, but I am going to wait even if it means waiting forever. I will not be cheated, that is what those who are bring these shows out are doing, cheating us. It isn't Amazon's fault, they can only sell what they are given."
4,One season - 12 episoldes,"The Love Boat was a fun show and I'm glad to see it on DVD. After the first ""season"" I wouldn't consider it as much a family show, but was still quite tame compared to todays shows. As for those griping about the split ""season"", what you really want is the first year, not first season. A season, when this show was created, was 12-13 episodes, 2 seasons a year--Spring and Fall. Times change, though, and now a season refers to a year. Makes no sense, don't know why they don't just say the first year, but that's Hollywood for you."
5,Love Boat,"The Love Boat - Season One, Vol. 1Great TV Show. When I saw this coming out, I pre-ordered it and will order the rest of the sets."
1,A fool and their money is soon parted!,"I guess if there's enough idiots out there who will pay full season prices for a half of a season containing only 12 episodes, which is why Paramount continues to release 1/2 seasons. THERE NO WAY I WOULD BUY ANY LOVE BOAT 1/2 SEASON RELEASES!"
2,"Like the shows, but...","I didn't know that I was getting half a season until I read the reviews! I'm offended. If I'm buying HALF of a season, I want to be told a lot less subtly than ""Season One, Vol. 1."" Studio distributors, that's a dirty trick to play on your customers. You get two stars, and only on the strength of the episodes do you avoid getting one."
2,The Love Boat (Season One),No Pilot Episode. Only Half of the Season for Full Price of an Entire Season. Not One of the Better Deals in the video market . . .
2,Half-Season = Disappointing Decision,"Another DVD disappointment. In the beginning DVD offered such hope. We were promised (compared to VHS) better quality, more features, more content in a smaller package. Instead we have to suffer through half-season releases, lame extra features, and worst of all: terrible musak substitutes for original series music (Northern Exposure and Tour of Duty are the worst examples.)I have to agree with others who are boycotting this Love Boat release. Wait for the whole season release and the original pilot movies should be included. What a shame this release is."
2,A little to silly.,I laughed at this show a lot when I was younger but now the show seems silly and boring. I am a big Turner Classic Movie buff and the romance in those movies seemed more believable then the ones in this show. Recommend this movie to old people that can't run away once the show began.
3,Bring Back the Memories of Saturday Nights,"This collection reminds me of many Saturday evenings, watching Love Boat, followed by Fantasy Island (same shows, just different premise and stars). I have to admit that the first season is good, but not great. Hoping that the studio will release the next season soon. I'd hate to think I'll have to watch reruns."
4,Love the Love Boat!,"I can't believe I am nostalgic about the 80's, but the release of this DVD set has been on my shopping list for a while till I finally bought it!Wasn't the first episode I watched the one with Bonnie Franklin as Steubing's ex-wife who is a nasty, overbearing B! It was always one of my favorites (Lord, I hate a sweaty head on a bald man!) The show was great for showcasing past and upcoming celebrities in the little vignettes. I really like it!The Love Boat - Season One, Vol. 1I will probably buy the others as they emerge!"
1,HATE Boat,Lousy decision to release half of the season AND lousier to skip the 3 pilot films. 10 seasons each broken in 2 equals 20 sets at 39.95 each...that's only $800. And...if they do release the films...perhaps another $100? $900 for the complete Love Boat? Sorry...that ship can sail without me.
3,Love the show... not the DVD release.,I have been a huge fan of The Love Boat ever since childhood and have been waiting for it to come to DVD forever. The episodes themselves didn't disapoint. I'm disappointed that only 12 episodes were released... no special features... no pilots/telemovies. The studio needs to get its act together and give it the release it deserves.
3,Needs the whole season,"I loved the Love Boat until Julie left. It was an era when stars guested on other shows. But why not release the whole first season? I would have given this 5 hundred stars if they had all the shows from season one. Just charge more if this is the case, but the tapes are just sitting in storage earning nothing, I haven't seen the show in reruns.Give us the whole season..."
3,"DVDs OK, but subtitles stink.","The DVDs are OK, despite no extras, but the subtitles aren't good. They don't subtitle things like ""Wow!"" at all, for instance. The subtitles don't add extra stuff, but the deletions are legion, plus there are several spelling mistakes. It's very disappointing for such a famous show.Otherwise, I thought the quality of the DVDs was fine, but I would've appreciated some interviews or whatever as extras; sometimes I prefer the extra stuff to the movies themselves!! The masters appeared to have been cleaned up a good bit, judging by other series' from that time frame."
3,ok,"First off I want to start by saying this bag took FOREVER to be delivered and came two days out of the delivery range. I don't really fault the seller for this because they did ship it out two days after I ordered it..ups can be painfully slow if you don't already know lol. Now, on a more serious note the bag is very tiny, which can be good or bad depending on your preference. For me it's a little too small. The lack of pockets is also an inconvenience. The metal accents are a nice touch, but the bag is pretty ordinary looking. I painted mine to punch it up. my suggestion is to try the Kavu brand they have wonderful canvas bags, I own one and like it better than this"
2,Not worth the money,I bought 2 of these for my 6 year old twins and was very disappointed. They are very small and they don't stay together. Would have returned if my husband had not thrown the boxes away. Not worth the money
2,How boring does this sound?...,Elizabeth travels to Costa Rica to build houses.Yawwwn.While there she slacks off on her duties and parties alot.It is rather a bore.
5,GREAT BOOK!,I thought that this book was great! I liked how Elizabeth wasn't acting like such a nerd anymore! She's a cool character so she deserves to have an oppurtunity to be cool!
5,What a Book!!!!!!!!,I thought that this book was realy good. I haven't read Jessica's diary so I realy can't compare them. Elizabeth seemed to change just a bit but that was for the good of the book.But over all it waas GREAT!!!!!!!
2,trash,"not worth the money. A bit of history..this is where he walked to school, this is where he modeled, his parents did thisand that. silly."
1,Not Recommended,"The contents: 1. Give yourself a chance 2. Let's build a beautiful body 3. How far can you go (charm rules) 4. Planning for tomorrow (Courtship) 5. When love comes (mental code) includes: ""womanhood's clock begins to tick"", ""The Beauty of sex"", ""dangers of sex"", ""self-satisfying sex urges""---> ""breaking the habit"", etc 6. Glamour at home 7.Getting the most out of the Christian lifeSuperficial; dealing with behaviour (i.e. the habit of masturbation)in itself instead of principals. Written in a ""story/conversational"" format, insipid and simple minded. Manners, barely touched upon are approached largely from an utilitarian perspective. The title of this book does not agree with its contents."
1,You get what you pay for,"Got my shirts and ready to throw them straight in the garbage, because that's where they belong. The quality is just utter crap.Right off the bat, a button came off and got lost, so I checked how they are sewn on - lots of loose threads, and not just on the buttons, but on the seams as well. The sizes are too big too. I normally wear a large and this shirt just hangs off of me, like it's a size too big."
3,"Good shirt, but careful about sizing...","For the price (it was on sale at Amazon), it's actually quite a decent shirt. I quite like it. The only issue was that I ordered my ""usual"" size and it was WAAAY too large.I would get it again if it were on sale and had the right size."
4,Easy to Install,"I have been buying this type of fill valve for years. It exists under several manufacturers names... fill pro, brass craft etc... VERY easy to install.. less than 5 minutes if you know what you are doing. Runs quiet as it is submerged. When installing only finger tight the round, doughnut plastice washer/nut on bottom of tank, they are easy to crack and split. My only beef... is that I average about 2.5-3 years to a valve, but I have well water which is hard on plumbing of all types. I also use bleach tablets in my tank which affects the gasket life. The diaphram inside gets mushy and wears out... they can be replaced... do a search for fill pro parts. But... when the valve does go... drain the tank, unscrew it..and screw in another one. No plungers to mess with. When they fail... they will continue to run slowly, nonstop... just make sure your overflow tube inside the toilet is not higher than the hole for your flush handle... found that one out the hard way...lol."
2,Purchase only if you do not use chlorine tablets,"I believe US production of these units has ceased, they are now made in China. With the Chinese unit selling for $6, the repair parts for the US version are getting scarce. My luck has been worse than Crypto102's, I have needed to replace the diaphragm every two years since I installed this unit. I like the design but if you use chlorine tablets, forget it, get an all brass unit Ballcock (090726) and be done with it. The less expensive all brass units are made in Taiwan but will outlast anything in a high chlorine environment."
1,Unhappy,"I used these type of fill valves in my old home, and it worked wonderfully with the older style tank (pre-ban), so I decided to try them in my new home which has a 2 gallon flush, first off I couldn't adjust of the water level to anything lower than the max my tank would hold, any less and the set screw would fall off, the other issue i had is the internal seal failed within 4 months, so my toilet would continuously run, I had purchased 2 with my order and needless to say i didn't get a years worth of use out of the pair. I'm not sure if both units were faulty or they just don't work well with a low volume tank, but I will not purchase one of these again"
5,Adventure Tales Of America,This is one of the best history books I have seen on the Americas and the U.S. in particular. Would Make an excellent text book for 7th grade though High school students. Also would be good for immigrants applying for citizenship.
4,Fun mix of sports and politics and everything Thompson,"This is the last book published while Hunter was still alive. Althought i seen the movies Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Where the Buffalo Roam i didn't start reading his work seriously until i read this archived on ESPN page 2 column. I have since purchased and read all of his books and read some of his other columns. Dr. Thompson's writting was brilliant, interesting and amusing. To me he brought the fun back in reading again and he will be missed by all who has enjoyed reading his works and those who have known him.Rest in Peace Dr. Thompson. Feb 20 2005"
3,More Guts Than Glory,"HST is still kickin' butt as an American journalist. That's the good news. His keen perspective and rabid style leaves no one in his sights unsplattered.I just don't know what it signifies that ol' HST's once-so-flamboyant approach today seems so -- well, routine is probably the word. Maybe I've gotten used to all the sex and violence and other recreational abuses in his writing. What seemed so outlandish in the 70s just doesn't rev my emotional engines these days.Can it be that HST is no longer the far left of news reporting and that Gonzo has become the yardstick by which journalism is now simply measured? He's less an engine than a baromter.Still well worth the time to read and think, a new HST book is like running into an old girlfriend. You're sure glad to see her again but soon wonder what it was that made you fall in love with her all those years ago. . ."
4,Rants! Rants! and more Rants!,"Sports and Politics don't mix but somehow Thompson makes it work. The book also sheds light on Hunters life, times, and wacky friends that make everyday an adventure. This author was the master of getting to the point. (easy read)"
5,Hunter fan,I like his writings on Bay Area sports... hes a fan and a gambler so he has a weird twist on sports... A reader for the bathroom ...and a sports fan
4,A Proven Strategy for Creating Great Art,Not only does this book address and embrace the basics of art butalso acknowledges the importance of developing individuality and creativity. I found this book to be sincerely written and easy to understand. I highly recommend it not only for his words but also his art
5,the Struggle,"Anyone trying to interpret their own vision in expression will find this hands-on book: invaluable. Finally! Someone who can express abstruse ideas cohesively, as paint...and colour...and texture...and design! Pap-ist my ass :) Thanks again, Dan McCaw, and humbly, Siobhan."
2,Same principles found in many art books.,There are many art books available with the exact same information for a lot less money. Kevin McPhearson's and Tom Browning's books to name a few. There are many examples of Dan McCaw's art and the only reason to invest such a large amount is if you really like the pictures.
1,"OK (but thin) advice, mediocre paintings","I wonder if the glowing reviews that appear below were written by people who have a financial interest in the success of this book? The advice it contains is pretty simple and middle of the road, but, like a previous reviewer, I found the illustrations chosen to support the advice to be really poor."
2,Disappointing and distracting,"I am disappointed with this recording. It is not at all exciting and contains intrusive coughing in several tracks.We had a wonderful recording of Gavrilov playing virtuoso 19th and 20th century repertoire, but this cd is not in that league.I recommend Murray Perahia's Handel and Scarlatti cd as a much better piano alternative."
3,Thomas Anders should be iconic in America,"This is a very beautiful down tempo album, and elegant pop. ""You Are My Life"" is probably the most beautiful ballad ever recorded, and they included the radio and more orchestral 'classical mix'. Why this artist has not garnished huge accolades for his flawless vocals (he is to male vocal, what Streisand is to female) and won many awards as a solo act in the USA - but unfortunately no label has picked him up from SONY BMG Germany. Hello? - where are you Clive Davis??? The best album is ""When Will I See You Again"" (1993). Jason E Davis eurodancehits.com"
2,Soldier,".This album contains a few good songs (""Soldier"", ""One Thing""), but in common, it's terrible - so boring!P.S. His best solo songs were produced in 1980-1984, although they were sung in German (except one).."
1,Does Not Work,"I purchased this item in order to have a simple means of backing up old files as the disk space on my laptop became full.The unit came with very limited instructions, which would have been okay, except the unit had errors everytime I tried to write to it. The user manual had several items to try, but when I backed down to a very small file, and it would not write to it, I gave up. The error messages I received were not in the user manual and I was given very little information, except that an error had occured. I am returning the item and will make sure the next unit buy is not from Iomega."
1,Incomprehensible,I found this in the philosphy section of a local store and was intrigued by the timely theme and title. Nothing else proved commendable about this book. This is the sort of book that gives philosphy a bad name. A dense fog of jagron so abstract that it almost seems like a parody. I must admit I could not finish this book. I was barely able to penetrate the first two chapters. Several honest attempts to scan the rest of the book read like pure gibberish.
2,What a waste of talent,"This was a once in a life time opportunity that was truly wasted. Supposedly some of the biggest names in Westerns were gathered for a reunion. The problem was that most of the biggest names were not really there. They were there only by having their pictures showed and their names read. Those who at least showed up had nothing to do. They either sat speechless at saloon tables or spent the better part of the hour listening to some ridiculouus saloon girls sing and dance about the west. This was a great opportunity to learn more about the heroes of tv's golden years, yet the producers decided to spend most of the time as if it were a variety show. Oh well, it's probably better than nothing at all."
3,"Didn't,t fit","Returned, it did nit fit stuck out way to far, ordered it fir 2012 ford.The ad did not specify to be automobile specific I looked it up seems to be made for Jeep trucks"
1,TOO BIG,You have to put it together with 3 screws onto the hitch insert. Then it wouldn't fit under the bumper on my F250. The top of the flag hits the bumper. Waste of money.
2,This is a redundant book,"This book offers nothing in the way of new material. The concepts are the same that are in many other parenting books and programs. I found no ""breakthroughs"" to be had. The claims do not match the material. I was disappointed to not find some ""new"" insights and useful techniques."
5,Universal phenomena,"This book and the course that it details literally has savied my childs life and mine. The techniques and philosophy recommended here is useful for all situations, including special needs children. DON'T MISS This it will change your whole life if followed and lived. Rose"
4,Melonhead,"MelonheadIn the novel, Melonhead,By Daniel De Guzman. Sidney is a 12 year old boy that is caught up between two of his divorced parents. Sidney decides to run away. He decides to travel across the country to get from Seattle Washington, to New York City. On the way he meets new people and learns different lessens from all of them.I like this book because it teaches me new lessons. One lesson I learned from the book was a man that Sidney meet on the bus named Moses Longfellow. He taught Sidney to always conceal his money in a safe place. In the book Sidney got mugged by some older kids and they stole his money. Luckily he kept $50 in his underwear. To this day I still keep money in a secret place just in case. In the book I also like how the book keeps you wanting to read more. I hope you like the book."
1,"Frequent Corruption Errors, Poor Tech Support","In using this program during the past few weeks, we are getting frequent corruption errors that prevent use of the database. Avanquest tech support is worthless via email and impossible to reach on the phone."
2,"I like the format, BUT- it crashes all the time!","Very frustrating. I have it on two computers, because it will crash on one computer-so I need it loaded on another computer so I can re-install and backup. I also have to shut down a few programs or it won't open at all, specifically Registry Mechanic. Tech Support? hahahhahaha"
4,Rounds Out Jacque's Collection,"My ferret Jacque has quite the wardrobe - plaid golf shorts, 2 tuxedos, a smoking jacket, and a seeming-endless supply of tank tops. He always mentioned that he needed something to capture the true essence of Jacque, however.The Marshall Ferret Beret was just the ticket.It comes packaged nicely, with a generic brown box, which hides the true treasure within. Although Jacque was asleep when it arrived (he spends 14-18 hours a day asleep and only really gets up around the hours of dawn and dusk...as most ferrets are prone to do), once he awoke, he was quite surprised. In fact, I would describe his reaction as ""knocked for six.""The only problem I found is that this hat is not really ""one size fits all"". As we all know, ferrets are sexually dimorphic predators with males being substantially larger than females. Jacque being a mister, means this domepiece barely fits on his noggin...please, begin making this hot beret in male and female sizes."
5,Very cute!,"My ferret is still a baby yet, and it fit him pretty well. It looks adorable on my little Yuki. :)"
2,If you love your ferret do NOT buy this hat,"I bought this hat for my ferret Chauncey. It did fit perfectly and he loved wearing it at first. He gamboled around the house and wouldn't stop admiring himself in the mirror. Then he wore it to school. There, a group of bigger ferrets started teasing him about it. Of course Chauncey ignored things quickly escalated and the hat ended up tattered, torn, and destroyed. Chauncey missed almost a week of school because of the trauma. If you Do buy this hat at least don't let your ferret wear it to school if there are bullies there. If it weren't for the bullies I'd give this 4 or 5 stars."
3,Who doesn't love . . .,"Blue October?I like whatever they do. Now, this CD only has, like, 2 or 3 songs and it's marked as ""demo only, not for sale."" Which means they are making money with something the company got for free. It should be cheaper!"
1,An old book,"This book was published in 1984 and much of the information in it is way out of date these days. If you want it just for the pictures fine, but look for another book if you want real useful information."
2,Ok,"I must admit I haven't really used it much but the times I have tried to use it I have not been able to find the answer I was looking for and ended up googling it instead!Also, I would be nicer if it came with color pictures, not a determination on the value of the book itself just would give it a more pleasant browsing experience."
2,Gdzie jest wolowina? (Where's the beef?),"The Grasinski Girls documents the lives of six Polish American, working-class sisters born in the 20's and 30's who married after high school, had children, and stayed at home to raise their families. Like most women of their generation, their choices were extremely limited.While this book is part of the excellent Polish and Polish-American Studies Series from Ohio University Press, there is barely any mention of the girls' ethnicity outside of their last name. I was expecting much more information on the girls' connection with their Polish heritage. While this is an interesting account of the last stand of the pre-feminist era, ethnicity doesn't even play a minor role. For those who thought it would, especially given the book's inclusion in the Polish and Polish-American Studies Series, The Grasinski Girls is a big disappointment."
4,The Grasinski Girls,This book arrived promptly and will be read by other family members. It is well written and evokes many memories and feelings of a times well visited.The resources of this book are well researched.
4,very enjoyable traditional music,"I first bought this as a discount cassette and later as a CD since I liked it so much. This is not some great musical masterpiece, but it is a compilation of several classic songs with traditional christian lyrics. This music is so good because George Jones was just good. I wouldn't say the song lyric content is very theologically deep, but it is enjoyable nonetheless. Personally, I doubt if ole possum is even a christian, even if he has recorded several christian albums."
1,False Description,"The product works well, no problems there. Great for saving on plastic bags or plastic wrap if you use a lot of canned pet foods. However, the description states:Product Description""CAN COVERS. We've all experienced it....the blast of pet food smells when you open the refrigerator door. Here's the solution. PET BUDDIES can food covers not only look great, but they keep food fresher longer, and keep the """"aromas"""" where they belong. A Perfect Fit for Tall and Short Cans, come 3 to a package. Colors: Blue, Aqua, Lime Green or clear (not shown).""That bottom line ""come 3 to a package"" is a flat out lie. You only get one. Or at least I did. It's not a bad deal, that is if you don't take shipping into account which brings it up to over $7 for one little plastic lid. There are better deals, with more accurate descriptions, out there."
4,"little window into bedroom humor,1960s","funny cartoon book by stan and jan berenstain ( who also created the berenstain bears for children) about the loveable,lazy,skirt chasing,couch potato type husbands-maybe someone like we know? somewhere in the world at some time??? the black and white cartoons are cool. a nice little slice of life in the 60s when life was still carefree and fun. i think this book is written more for older teens and adults-not so much for young kids."
1,a shame...,"The worst thing about the F.F. on video here is that the whole first season was the worst production in the history of Superheroes on screen. If they wanted to make the public happy, they'd put the SECOND season out on video. They had a whole new crew brought in and did a 5 star job adapting Kirby and Byrne episodes. Sadly, they'll never get to it because the first season episode will NEVER sell. Just a word of advice out there to F.F. fans: seek out the second season thru reruns and you'll know 'em when you see 'em. Unlike the first season, they WON'T make you ill in the first 5 minutes."
2,the animation is poor,"This should have been a much better animated series then what they gave us. The shows looks like crude drawings that were all placed together in a very crude manner. Even the actors who played the voices of the characters in the series, sound like they had better things to do then this. This was part of a short-lived FF animation series that premired in 1994 but was canceled in 1996 because of poor rateings. If you ever see this episode, you can understand why."
2,wasnt happy about description,"description says 1976 but its 1997...as a HUGE fan of fantastic four i was dissapointed, but though modern technology (and a tivo) i was able to find and record the full 1976 first season onto VHS, but still unhappy that it said it was 1976 but it turned out to be something that was shown 21 years later..."
5,A wonderful book!,"I loved this book. It's well-written, fast-paced, and fascinating. The true stories of people reunited with their families are uplifting. Even though I wasn't adopted, I was inspired by the way these people overcame their loneliness, feelings of alienation, and challenging situations. Reading this book is a great way to relax and feel good."
5,Love and Suspense,"As an author, I know how difficult it is to write a heartfelt book that is also true and also suspenseful. In Together Again, Carolyn C., one of my favorite non-fiction authors, has done all three, masterfully! Whether the reader has any personal connection with adoption or its frustrations and rewards, she/he can't help but be drawn into the story lines of these three wonderfully developed characters, rooting for their success at every turn. I heartily recommend it!"
1,Fluff,"I'm a 35-year-old adoptee that was reunited with my birthmother within the past year. I had spent over 15 years searching for her on my own and finally hired private investigators who came through for me after almost five years of waiting. (Fortunately, with them, you don't pay until THEY find!!!) Anyway, my reunion was more than I could have hoped for and am pleased to have a good relationship with my birthmother.The stories in this book were very interesting but this book is hardly an in-depth, insightful look at the emotional roller coaster of search and reunion. I found it quite shallow when it came to dealing with the gut level feelings of the members of the adoption triad. All I can say is that these stories could have been condensed and published in Reader's Digest, which I also find skims the surface in their articles. I would not recommend this book at all as a major resource for searching adoptees or birthparents.... This was a real disappointment."
2,"sales pitch for ""reuniting"" company","I ordered this book just recently and found it to be an ""infomercial"" for the company who published it. The three stories are all very interesting and touching until you get to the end when the birthmother/adoptee calls the 1-900 number ($3.95 per minute!!) and with the help of these ""caring"" searchers, is reunited with their families (on national TV). Once I realized who published it, I felt taken to have paid money for this book and truly doubted the honesty of the stories. Don't waste your money on this one. Keep looking, there are some great books out there - such as ""Birth Bond"" and all of the books by Betty Lifton."
3,"history, but nothing more","How did the Baroque composers organize each concerto movement? How was the thematic material developed and restated? What distinguishes a German concerto from an Italian concerto?If you want to know the answers to these questions, don't bother to read this book. If you already know the answers to these questions, publish a book and send me an advertisement. The author of this book uses terms such as ""the Mannheim school"" and ""the galant style,"" but will not provide us with any definitions. He speaks of composers imitating the style of Corelli or the style of Vivaldi, but will not describe what traits are being copied from these two composers.I am currently composing a concerto in the Baroque style, and I was hoping that this book would help. I hope to goodness I am not mixing the German style with the Italian style."
4,Lots of fun,"My boys (2 and 6 yrs) love this video. Of all the power ranger incarnations, I like Lightspeed the best. They teach a subtle morality that kids pick up on. Carter's (the red ranger) altruistic nature is so refreshing compared to most shows kids want to watch. This video is just plain fun, especially if kids are familar with both Lightspeed and Lost Galaxy Rangers."
2,Not in 3-D,"This is a VHS of ""Trakeena's Revenge"" and it comes with a pair of so-called 3-D Glasses, they're not 3d glasses, they aren't even the classic red/blue glasses, it's clear and there's no 3-d. If you want this episode just buy it on the ""Best of Power Rangers: Ultimate Rangers"" dvd."
4,Trakeena's Revenge,"Trakeena returns to earth with Triskull and his ghouls to get revenge from the Power Rangers for destroying her green insect form. The Lightspeed Rescue rangers can't handle it all, so the Galaxy Rangers travel back to earth to help them. This video was released during the 2000 McDonalds Lightspeed Promotion, though very few got it since very few were produced. It was aired on TV as a two part miniseries, Trakeena's Revenge. This video is good, but has excessive amounts of Sentai footage. Also, Trakeena is portrayed by a different actress and Leo's voice is done by Russell Lawrence since Danny Slavin didn't agree to do voice-overs. But all in all, it's still a must have for any Power Rangers fan"
3,Better for an older child,"Noce cd but the book is not very exciting... black and white, not many pictures. My 4 yr old was showing an interest in Spanish so I bought this for her... this is really for a kid who can read independently."
2,Some good some bad advice but mostly just one person's opinion,"This book is very uneven. Some of the advice is ridiculous such as having a pest inspector in to check your house on a monthy basis.Some is just platitudes such as ""the best way to live is generously"". Well maybe as long as you limit your exposure to being ripped off.The financial advice is good for the most part.Nowhere does the author say how he knows all this and why we should believe him. You don't know which advice is good and which is not, if you don't already know.There is a lot to learn in life, so by all means read this book but don't rely too heavily on it."
1,Meh...,"I don't like this book. While reading, it feels like 18-year-old wrote this. Personally, I didn't get anything from this book."
5,It gets better and better,"Bendis's run on Daredevil has been one of the best ever. Much better than Miller's. That's right, I said it. This book's been building from the beginning, and it only gets better here. Bendis's crime noir past is apparent and very welcome, and Maleev's art is probably the best matched to a book that I can think of. The Volume 5 HC is gonna be the real gem, but this one includes the 'King of Hell's Kitchen' and 'The Widow' storylines, both of which were great. I suggest picking up all the hardcovers, as they don't really cost you any more than the trades and everything about them is great. Sad to see Bendis and Maleev go."
2,superficial and obtuse,I thought that this book was pretty awful. Its coverage was superficial and obtuse at best. The author seemed to have very little understanding of rural life and even less comprehension of the sources of Agrarian protest. Her chapter on Populism was filled with factual errors and was just plain wrong.
5,love it!!!!!,"I absolutely love this perfume!!! For me, it's important for a perfume to be light and a little subtle and this is perfect! It's not too heavy and it lasts for hours. I have gotten so many compliments on the scent, even from strangers. It's now my signature scent and the only perfume I use. This size is large and lasts forever. It's seriously worth the money!!!"
4,nice,plush n comfy.. always a fav with the kids who visit our home.. would recommend.. the site n games r way too kiddish for us tho.. maybe the kids love them
1,Non Existant Customer Service,"We have been waiting over 2 months for username approval. No rejections or responses of any type from Shing Stars moderators. You need username approval to do certain things on the site (like have buddies, which is a ""BIG"" thing most of the kids want!)The only way to contact them is through e-mail form on their site, 90% of the time you get a canned response. It took me 3 e-mails to even get a response from them (and guess what- they answer they gave implied it was a canned response or did not read the entire e-mail).Stick with Web Kinz! At least there is plent of FAQ's on their site (something else Shining Stars has very little of)It's not very compatiable with FireFox either."
4,Third Season; single episode,"If you are a fan of the Tick, then this is a good video for you. There are 36 episodes of the Tick all told, though, and this one is in the bottom 25%. Of course, there are only 2 The Tick videos released, this one and The Tick vs. The Idea Men. If you are looking for the other 34 episodes I'd recommend writing Comedy Central and complaining or downloading them from Gnutella."
3,"Good, but not the best","This salsa is pretty good. I like the variety, but I want to have somthing that makes it seem like I'm at a great restaurant at home.The best I've tried is Border Town Salsa. […]That is real salsa that tastes like it comes from your favorite restaurant.Try some of that if you want something to impress your friends and family."
3,trewax,"Not sure if the formula for this wax has changed over the years, seems to me it was a far better wax years ago."
5,useful book,I presented this book to my Mayflower Colony Historian and she found it very useful in her search for ancestors of applicants..
3,Sounds better than it actually is.,"I bought this pillow for my wife, who'a a side-sleeper. She like a super firm pillow and this was really no better than aveage firmness. We returned it."
1,Like a cinder block wrapped in cotton,"I recently purchased two of these king size pillows. I was very disappointed from the moment I lay down on one. It feels like a large brick wrapped in padding. The pillow is way too firm. I made a large mistake wasting money on these pillows. Try not to do the same thing.Of course, the fact that Amazon's return policies would cost me $15 per pillow to return them means I am keeping them until I can sell them off somewhere. That's quite annoying too."
5,Super,I really like this pillow.It took a couple of nights to get used to it because it is very plump.It keeps its shape better than others I have tried.
2,Mixed Results,"This pillow is a mixed bag for me. I like a tall very soft pillow. Of course tall soft pillows go flat rather quickly. So I hoped the springs in this one would solve the problem. While this pillow is certainly tall, it's not soft enough. Some nights its comfortable, some nights its too hard. This is after sleeping on it for a month. I also have to flip it daily as the springs shift a little. And if you buy this you will need a JUMBO pillow case.January 31, 2013 now and I like the pillow even less. Too hard. Sometimes the springs feel like I'm sleeping on a brick. Thinking of cutting open the pillow and pulling out the springs."
5,Simmons Beautyrest Pocketed Coil Queen Pillow,"I like these pillows a lot. It took a couple of nights to get used to having a ""full"" pillow again. These hold their shape, and offer good support. A draw back is, that they are so full that sometimes, the pillow cases are very tight on them as are most protective pillow covers. I'll put up with those concerns because the pillow really are comfortable."
4,Plenty of stuffing that lasts!,"I purchased these first at Tuesday morning quite awhile ago. They lasted for a year. It took ahwile to find them but here they are on Amazon at a great price! My Husband really enjoys the way that they keep their shape after being used day after day. For me, it's taken awhile to get used to. Overall, you can't go wrong if you like big fluffy pillows that stay that way."
5,fat pillow,"If you have trouble with your pillow becoming flat, or if you are a big person who always has to turn and fluff pillows this is the pillow for you. I always order the King size pillow. And wait till your try and stuff it into a king size pillow case. I can lay on my left side all night and never have this pillow flatten out. If you hate super firm pillows don't order this one. However if you love super firm pillows give this baby a try. Forget the 10 year warrenty you should get about 3 to 4 years of heavenly comfort, and a great nights sleep."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,Please do not waste your money purchasing these pillows. They are made in China with inferior materials. They are NOT extra firm as advertised.All of quality control at Beautyrest should be terminated for allowing the manufacture and sale of such inferior quality goods.I originally bought these pillows 2 years ago and they were of the highest quality. I just received 2 new pillows in early June of 2009 and they are pathetic.There is hardly any stuffing in these pillows so they are practically flat to begin with and a Queen size pillow is the size of a standard size pillow. The pocketed coil in the middle is much smaller now than it was previous.Everything made in China is of shoddy material and craftmanship. Beautyrest STOP having your pillows made in China!!! I refuse to buy another Beautyrest pillow.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I bought this thinking this was a new Carl McCoy-Nephilim cd, but it's very missleading, & it's NOT! This is some WAY below average thrash band. The recording sounded like a demo. Beware buyers! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
5,Nice Quality Daybed Bedding Set,"The quality is very good however the ""uni-pillow"" cover is longer than the two king pillows suggested to put in it so it sags in the middle. Not sure if one of those ""uni-pillows"" would work better. The shipping time took about 3 weeks which was consistant with the shipping time listed. The packinging showed a different daybed cover set than what I purchased and received so I was concerned at first that I was shipped the wrong order but it turned out fine."
4,Double-check some tracks,"This is a guitar player's dream...to master one of the best. Unfortunately, some of these songs seem to suffer from inaccurate tabbing. The better you get, the more you will be able to figure out the problems."
4,Inexpensive monitor table mount,"This is the second identical mount that I have purchased. My desire was to get a table mount that would fold up relatively compactly and not cost too much. In my opinion, $75.00 was a deal breaker. I modified the first one to mount (bolt) to a half-inch thick piece of plastic that I could either move to my lap on my recliner or leave on a table. I bought the second one (this purchase) to replace a mount that broke. Again, I could not find a better cost/performance trade off. This one is mounted to my desk and is unmodified. I am very satisfied with both. This product is extremely rugged."
5,a missed comparison?,"Excellent cd - bought without having heard a thing by him in advance and most pleasantly surprised. However, I don't see the Steve Earle comparison - to me this is reminscent of classic John Mellancamp and anyone who loves Mellancamp circa Scarecrow and Uh-Huh will love this"
5,"Dark On the Outside, Light On the Inside","This album comes off really dark at first, but once you get inside there is light and that light is good for you... Some of the best music can be hard to get on... here you get an easy ride.... Once inside it becomes obvious this is a sweet contemplative album with punch.It's rare to find an artist like this these days since no one shares the music without getting paid for it... Hence radio pop only and no Chris Knight in sight... Radio airplay is so far away from what real music lovers want... stripped down disorganized fun.An album like this has to be lifted up,as it is a great album by a tremendous artistHighly Recommended !"
5,Like Good Old Mellencamp,"What a great, solid rock album. The recording is great as well. Have played it many times and always enjoy it."
3,"Not worth $5, but all in all not bad.","Very interesting book. It is exactly what the title says and it's nicely written. It covers treasures from all over the world although I'm sure it doesn't cover all of them. The author does provide a bibliography at the end of the book but he didn't make specific references to these books in the body. I found this a little annoying because I would have liked to know where to look in other books in hopes of finding more information. This book is a good starter book in my opinion. It'll give you enough information if you want to pursue lost treasures further. Definitely a rip off at $5 though. Amazon has a free book about some pirates treasures and stuff. I'd have felt better paying $.99 or $1.99 for this though. Oh well, live and learn."
4,Sex and Death 101,"This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. There is a lot of cussing in the movie, made me want a TV Guardian. but I love Simon and this is one of his best."
2,"A little boring, a little repetitive, and a big waste of time","So I love the movieHeathers - 20th High School Reunion Edition, which is one of the reasons I was excited to try out this film. The lead character, played by Simon Baker, is accidentally e-mailed a list of every woman he's ever slept with, including the ones he hasn't even met yet. Even though he's married, he goes on a quest to meet all these women and have sex with them, not bothering with relationships but just wham bam on to the next one. Meanwhile, Winona Ryder's character is a kind of black widow who goes after misogynistic men. Wonder of wonders, she's the last one on his list.I didn't like this film. It was tedious, it was boring, and it wasn't funny. I only watched it to complete this review, but I wouldn't even recommend you do that. Rent Heathers. It's funny, entertaining, and you'll enjoy it infinitely more."
2,very uneven,"Bought it, saw it, not impressed. Much of this story simply does not fit together. Some of the acting was good but much was just passable. And the story simply doesn't work"
2,Interesting premise,"This movie is about a man who stumbles onto a list of every woman he has slept with and will ever sleep with. Interesting premise but that's about it. He blitzes through the list which speeds up the plot to a unbelievable and silly conclusion. There's some black comedy but not much in the way of laugh out moments. Jessica ""Sugar"" Kiper from TV's ""Survivor"" is here very briefly for fans of that TV show. Really just a so-so movie."
2,SEX AND BOREDOM 101,"First of all, the ""movie"" was shot entirely on video, with a ""TV"" show or ""live"" look, which makes the production look very low-budget. The story was just barely captivating, and quite honestly, despite the lure of the title, quite boring. The cast tried hard, but not even Winona Ryder was able to save this one!"
2,"Good Cast, Thin Plot","This is an adult sex comedy whose plot revolves around whether you can alter your destiny or whether you are fated to follow it. The gimmick that drives the plot is thin and silly, but the cast is appealing and the writer delves into every male fantasy. The sub-plot is centered around Wynona Ryder as ""Death Nell"", who, in an attempt to revenge herself for abuse from her dead husband, puts men into comas. The two eventually meet and their fates collide at the end. The writer, Dan Waters, also wrote Heathers. This is nowhere as good as that movie, but ir is light and diverting. Simon Baker is the lead actor and does a credible job, though with a meatier script he would be far more appealing. If you are a fan of Benny Hill this would appeal to you."
2,Inconsistent and barely entertaining,"What if you knew everyone you would sleep with in your lifetime? Roderick Blank gets that information but unfortunately, his fiance is pretty low on the list of 101... and he soon turns into the quintessential ladies man with one hot young babe after another since he knows who is a sure thing now. Of course when he runs into a serial killer with the moniker of Death Nell you'd think he'd rethink his strategy.I really didn't care for this movie and probably would have turned it off about half way through but I like the lead actor, Simon Baker. He just seems horribly miscast and unbelievable. The film oftens veers off into sophomoric humor, which normally I like, but it didn't even do base comedy well. One of the highlights of this mostly unfunny film is ""Facts of Life"" alum Mindy Cohn as Rod's secretary. If you are loking for true black comedy - you might as well stick with Waters triumph, ""Heathers."""
1,horrible,"I could not even get through this absurd film. Some films today are so bad as to boggle the mind. There are good filmmakers out there with good stories to be told. What is going on people?Also, this film was entirely predictable and could have been any episode of hundreds of TV shows. This plot has been done to death in many forms. Do they think we won't notice, or do they not notice. Either way it's sad."
1,dlmoore,"Well, I really like Simon Baker...but this movie really sucked. Maybe he did it for the money since it was before Mentalist. He is a great actor and I recommend the series Guardian. But, this movie was just crap."
4,Sex And Death 101,"Interesting story. What would you do if you knew everyone you'd ever sleep with before you died? I have to say this was a real original story and played out quite well. As for the value of this Blu-Ray disc, picture was quite clear and crisp, not reference material but still a real good looking disc. The audio is audio from a comedy, so it's not packing a huge impact on your surround sound. All in all, a quite entertaining movie and a good Blu-Ray disc."
3,Visual treat at best!,"This movie has an unusual and 'Hard-to-believe' plot and if it wasn't for watching handsome Simon Walker for 2 hours, it would be a real bore!"
3,Heathers 2? Couldn't get into it...,"This is by writer/director Daniel Waters, same guy who didHeathers&Hudson Hawk.I couldn't really get into this movie. Then again, I was not a huge fan of Heathers. I will say, though, the acting was solid, and it was good to see Julie Bowen (fromBoston Legal) on the big screen.Based on conversations with friends, reviews on other sites, I take it this movie requires a certain type of perverted sense of humor. I fully realize not all art appeals to all people - which is why I gave it a neutral rating. Just not my cup of tea, but I guess Daniel Waters wasn't really writing it for me.So, I'd say, if you enjoy slightly twisted movies in the same vein asHeathers,Reality Bites,Better Off Dead,Fast Times at Ridgemont High,Clerks,Mallrats,Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, etc, then go ahead and check it out."
3,Quirky Comedy,Sex and Death 101 is a quirky comedy by Daniel Waters the writer of Heathers. Starring Simon Baker as Roderick Blank the film confronts the question of what a person would do if he knew every person he was destined to sleep with. Would this information change the way he lives his life. Others were given the time of their death by the same computer glitch that gave Blank his list.The film is not bad as a whole and Waters has some good lines unfortunately the film veers a little too much into the teen sex comedy arena for my tastes. The acting is a little bland even though it was good to see Wynona Ryder as Death Nell. The movie has the potential to become a cult classic like Waters earlier fil Heathers if it manages to find its audience.The disc I viewed contains a commentary track by Waters thet is well worth a listen. Check it out if your interest lies in this type of film.
4,you get what you pay for,the cord seems a little flimsy compared to what you would buy at the at&t store. very thin. I am scared I might break it. But it works. If you don't intend on doing a lot of travel with it you'll be fine. just plug it in to the pc and leave it there. just plug and unplug the other end as needed.
1,No PC Studio connection,"If you want to use Samsung PC Studio 3 with this cable, it doesn't work.It just won't connect to the phone.Sure the computer sees the memory card, but as far as PC Studio goes, this cable is worthless.Samsung must have something special with their own brand Data cable cause they asked meto buy theirs instead. So spending $20 for their cable to use PC studio is unavoidable."
1,don't ever buy the samsung erenity or its accessories,this phone does not meet any expextations for this century its absolutly undevolped phone you can call it from flinstone era the only thing good about it that i had two kids and it takes alot of hits but beware dont depend on this phone's camera you will never be able to get them out unless you buy expensive things (more than the phone's price ) to maybe not surly transfer the pics. VERY DISAPPOINTED I WOULD GIVE IT IN THE MINUS STARS IF THERE IS.
5,Works Well,A needed option for the Eternity to charge vis computer or Ford Sync. Also needed for file transfers if you don't have Bluetooth on computer. Work just as expected.
5,Awesome!,"This is a must have for the Eternity. By using this cable to connect to a PC, you will never have to remove the SD chip from behind the battery ever again. I ordered this cable Friday afternoon and received it on Monday! The cable is authentic Samsung OEM as the seller claims. Don't pay 19.99 on AT&T's website for the same thing!"
1,"warning to all: works for charging, does not work for data","This is *NOT* an OEM cable for the Eternity. This vendor sent me an OEM cable for the Samsung M300!!! Completel bait and switch. Sure, the connection fits, and it'll charge the phone, but it's completely worthless if you want to use it for transferring data, it doesn't seem to have the proper connections for that.I suggest you search for the proper product name on Amazon instead: APCBS10UBEBSTD that will get you the correct vendor for a data cable for the Eternity.You've been warned."
1,Worthless,"This will serve to charge your Samsung Eternity, but that's all it will do. Hardware (the phone) will not install. Does not fit phone very well, either. Samsung insists that only the exact cable will work... and so far, after two ""similar"" items from Amazon vendors, I have not gotten one that works. What did I expect for a penny? Tried E-Bay (part number matches Samsung), and waiting..."
5,Item as expected,This item is working fine for my Samsung Eternity A867 charging and data transfer. Perfect piece!
4,Nice video lots of information but not lot of Diana footage,This is a good video. It interviews many of Princess Diana's close friends and associates. They don't however give any in depth or new information. Most of this stuff you've heard before. Also I wish there was more Diana footage.
4,A really GREAT video of Diana. One of the best.,"This video is a GREAT look at her life, in an affectionate manner from some one who ACTUALLY knew her. The only video I liked better was A&E's Biograpy."
5,"Finally, a grown-up book about love","I won't repeat what everyone else said who liked this book - but would just add that I liked the measured pace that allowed the story to fully explore all its elements. I didn't find it repetitive - rather, there was musicality in the way motifs were revisited throughout the story. Finally, as nobody seems to be mentioning the ""a"" word - adultery - is this the last taboo, that people haven't come out of the closet about? - it was a joy to read a book with a mature and realistic outlook on that subject. It's about time! Similarly, religion. I wish I could find more books like this that reflect and illuminate the world I really live in."
5,Could not put it down ...,"Once I got into this story, it had me captivated by the eccentricity of the primary characters. Flip-flopping between then and now, 1955 and 199? was an effective technique for this book. The antics the teenage characters pull remind me of the days when I was their age. As the characters show themselves as adults, it is obvious how a true love really impacts us, regardless of time or age. Terry Kay had me going from laughing out loud to crying tears near the end. I am sure my children thought I, too, was as off the wall as Avrum was thought to be. A friend loaned me the book, now I am buying a copy for myself to re-read!"
2,"Good writing, but it left me with a bad taste in my mouth","I shudder every time I think about this book. I read it right before the termination of my first long-term relationship. The story is about a man who married a woman but can't stop thinking about a different woman he met when he was young. The feeling that you're not with the right person and there's someone better out there was persistent throughout this novel and absolutely wormed its way into my consciousness as well.I'm not blaming this book for splitting us up, that was a break-up waiting to happen. All the same, the only thing I remember about reading this book is the incredibly icky, dismal, guilty feeling it gave me. I do remember that I finished it, and that it was influential enough to affect my mood, so it deserves more than one star. But since I mentally recoil every time I think of this book, I won't give it more than two."
4,Short and Sweet.,I picked this up at the Motor City Nightmares horror convention and was quite impressed. I've never really paid too much attention to short films but this movie is making me change my mind. It was well paced and timed perfectly. This movie definitely delivered the goods and didn't leave much to be desired. I'm definitely looking forward to checking out the rest of the Poison Apple film library.
1,Useless Junk!!,"This ""Official Strategy Guide"" is a sad waste of trees. It offers NO new information. If you have basic common sense, and the manual/guide included in the software, you are already 3 steps ahead of this useless book."
3,"OK, but I do have some complaints","What I really didn't need was the large re-hash of the general Sims information. Over half of the book was dedicated to this, completely useless to me. I already have that in my well-worn copy of Sims ""Living Large."" The small section on Unleashed was helpful. It explained the new areas, the objects, careers and such. But I would have preferred that the majority of the book include information about Unleashed and perhaps a small chapter going over the general information."
1,A Waste of Paper,"If you have played any part of this SIMS series of games you will find this book completely useless. There is no new information worth mentioning, and no new cheats offered."
1,Young CHRISTOPER WALKEN,"I purchased the movie for a friend that had not seen Christopher Walken in a movie where he wasn't the bad guy. I wasn't aware of the movie, so we watched it together.It was the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. CW is very young, and there's another actor or actress I recognized who was also very young.The movie is cheesy, to say the least. Bad acting, bad ""special"" effects, but somehow, it grows on you. I'm sending it to my daughter, who is also a CW fan. But I'm sending it as a joke - or a movie ""she must see, but don't expect anything."""
1,Save Your Money,If you enjoy musicals with poor acting then this is your movie. Now I have to admit that I didn't watch the trailer and if I had I wouldn't have rented this movie. By the description I was expecting an annimated film. If you are a Christopher Walken fan you might be interested in seeing one of his early works with him as a redhead singing and dancing both of which I am glad he gave up.
3,Puss in Boots,"The story was only average and somewhat uninteresting. I think it lacked the dramatic contrast necessary in any story and action. However, the music's instrumentation would be quite useful for teaching and testing the students' knowledge of orchestral sounds."
5,Back to childhood,This is a very good movie that makes you remenber of the good old days of your childhood. I liked it.
4,On the fence.....,"This is a great coffee table book .... the photographs are beautiful, the quotes fitting and Ill probably get many years of enjoyment out of looking at it from time to time. However, I thought this book (through its photos) was going to give me some ideas on simple flower arranging and container choices. Instead, the photos are of macro shots of flowers, so close up that you really cant see the detail of the containers at all. What this book has done is given me some insight on some different flowers to ask for when I go to the market to pick them up, or plants to ask the nursery about when I pick out flowers for my garden next spring. Anyone who enjoys flowers will love this book, just don't get it with the hopes that you will get any arranging ideas from it. All in all, a gorgeous book that puts me in a cheery mood just by looking at it :)"
3,Not a popcorn connoisseur,"Got these expecting them to be night and day compared to the typical kernels, but it was hard to tell the difference. Awesome price point, and sure to visually pop when prepared infront of guests. Used an airpopper and most popped :)"
4,LOVE different color popcorn,"Would have given it 5 stars but there was no expiration date on the package and when I tried to call the phone # they give you for customer service it just rang and rang and rang- no one ever answered the phone!- NOT good. Lots of things I do use up right away and I don't like to take the chance on getting sick, not good not knowing how long it is ok to eat. :/ oh well, I guess i'll eat it for 3 months and any left i'll pop and give to the birds and the deer that hang out at the stream in my backyard."
4,Popcorn,This popcorn does all pop. Doesn't have much taste. I will get the seasoning salt or something and see how it tastes after that. I have poured butter over it but then to me that defeats the idea of diet stuff.
3,Really expensive popcorn. Does not get stuck in teeth as much as other brands.,"Really expensive popcorn. Does not get stuck in teeth as much as other brands. You really have to try for yourself, but do not expect this to be 4 times better than Orville Redenbacher's. the flavor is good, and there is a lot less junk to get stuck in your teeth."
4,Great but not for people with TMJ,"I love the taste of this popcorn! I actually like the fact that it's smaller pieces. The middle hull part is still too tough for my poor jaw. I don't know if this would be different if I cooked it in oil, I've only used the air popper."
3,"Good, but not the best Amish popcorn t ype","It pops into large kernels, but the flavor and texture of this popcorn just isn't as good as the Baby White from Amish. If you're looking for the perfect movie theater style popcorn, get the Baby White and skip this one. However, this popcorn isn't bad and I would prefer it over the grocery store Orville crap. I didn't have many unpopped kernels but this popcorn has fairly large hulls."
4,Above Average Gourmet Popcorn,"This is a better than average gourmet popcorn. It is the same variety as that sold as Fireworks brand Orchard Harvest, but seems to be a bit crisper after popping and the taste is better. It is nearly hulless, smallish kernels, good flavor. If you prefer ""Orville Redenbacher"" type flavor, this may not be the popcorn for you. Pops beautifully in a hot air popper. We'll buy this again."
4,Replaced an identical one.,Hang on to your sales receipt. The product is fine but my first one developed a leak in the outlet arm. I have an external water filter attached to it which pressurizes the arm and a pin hole leak started and sprayed the window behind. It was an obvious manufacturing flaw but I could not find the receipt to get it replaced. The replacement arm was more than 60% of the cost new so I went new again.
5,"Great CD, worth buying.","I hate to admit it, but I am definetly a band wagon jumper. After hearing her song ""Bubbly"" on the radio I knew that purchasing COco would be a good choice. Though some of her music borders to close to generic pop (Oxygen, for instance) for the most part the CD is composed of Jack Johnson-esque songs/stories. I would definetly say Capri is my favorite on the cd. Overall, Coco is a good CD for adults in their twenties. It's got just enough pop and guitar with meaningful lyrics to boot. I highly recommend it!"
2,Fluffy music,"If you like bubblegum pop, this is the music for you. If you, like myself, don't care for mainstream music--but the song ""Bubbly"" appealed to you--spend your money elsewhere. I was disappointed by this CD. I'm glad I got it on sale, otherwise I'd be more upset about the purchase than I am."
3,Just OK,"Love Colbie Caillat! This CD is typical of most CD's these days. About 3 songs that are worthy,,the rest just filler. That's the reason I don't purchase many CD's."
4,Bubbly... Effervescence,"As much as 'Bubbly' sounded like a rip-off of a familiar melody, her irresistible positive vibe puts her above the other morose headbanging banshees - quiet has been the new loud for a long time coming, and it doesn't get old... get bowled over by the 'aw-shucks' sweetness of 'realize'... I'm sold..."
5,Best CD I've bought all year!!,"I bought this CD because I fell in love with ""bubbly"". Now I love all the songs. They are catchy and Colbie has such a unique tone and style. I truely recomend this to others who are looking for something different."
5,Totally Wonderful!,"I've just got to say that Colbie Caillat is amazing! I love her voice, the lyrics in her songs, and the music itself. I got started with her on MySpace and absolutely fell in love with ""Bubbly."" When I got the album I realized that she has many amazing songs. I have recommended this album to MANY of my friends and no one has been dissatisfied yet! Buy this album it's totally worth the price, in fact it's under-priced as far as I'm concerned. Wonderful, I can't wait to see what she comes out with next!"
4,New favorite album,"With MP3 players, it is very rare these days for me to listen to an entire album start to finish (I usually jump around so much). Colbie Caillat's new album, Coco, however has been in my car's CD player non-stop since I got it a few weeks back. My favorite track is ""Magic"" and I listen to it by far the most. ""Bubbly"" and ""Capri"" are also close seconds. Honestly though, all the tracks are great, and there isn't a single one I skip over - as so often happens with most CDs.I would also recommend buying / downloading her other titles that are available but do not appear on this album ""Mistletoe,"" ""Dreams Collide,"" ""Older"" and ""Circles.""The only possible negative I would give to this album is the background vocalist. He does not have a very good voice, and when his track is turned up too loud, he can really detract from Colbie's voice. She is best at her purest (ie - no background vocals) - like in Capri."
2,"Liked Bubbly, bought the cd, but...","I bought this cd after liking her hit, Bubbly. On first listening to the cd, I thought it was pretty good. But after listening through a few more times, although I like some of the lyrics(though some of them are the 'complaining girl in a relationship' which are deathly annoying), but the music is TERRIBLE.At first impression, as many have said, it reminds you a little of Jack Johnson, but when you compare the two, Jack Johnson beats the music on this cd by a landslide."
5,It's perfect.,"I love Colbie Caillat. I heard one song on this CD on the radio and I had to find out who the artist was. I had never heard of her. I adore the entire CD. I'm going to do a search on ""Google"" to find out more about this fantastic artist. I love her style of singing. You go GIRL!!!!"
1,"Don't walk, run away from this album","Just about every song on this album sounds the same as the last one. As several reviewers have pointed out, this album is repetitive and uninspiring. If I have to listen to Bubbly being played yet one more time on the radio, I think I'm going to scream. I found this album has very few redeeming qualities and don't understand what all the fuss is about. I would definitely recommend Sara Barellis if you're looking for a fresh, new break-out artist. Coco is lacking substance, style and soul. Save your money for a better album."
4,Great Album!,"As for music, the CD has many good songs that I enjoy listening too. One downside to this particularly CD is that it jumps from time to time. At first, I thought this happened because it was dirty, so I decided to use a CD cleaner, but it still continued to jump. So it's probably scratched. Aside from that, the CD features great mellow music and the price is very fair. Thanks!"
2,Sugar puff,"Definitely a fun breezy music, but soon all the songs pretty much sound the same and I wished maybe I just bought the radio hit."
3,Not A Bad CD But Not That Great Either,"I gave this album 3 stars because I expected more. Colbie has a mellow California voice. Kind of reminds me of someone you may find in a karaoke or song night in a bar. Vocally she is not like a LeAnn Rimes, Joss Stone or Mariah Carey (beginning of her career). My favorite song on Coco is ""Bubbly"" and ""Oxygen"" is not bad. The other songs to me sound the same after awhile (lyrically especially). I do like the idea that she writes her own music (unfortunately you can't say that for a lot of the young cookie cutter singers today). Her music has no ""Wow"" factor to me. I think there is talent there it just doesn't really show on this album for me. When I buy an album I want someone that vocally and lyrically impress me. And unfortunately this album does not do that."
4,Relaxing and Fun,I bought this cd after hearing one of the artists songs on myspace and loving it. I was not let down--this entire CD is relaxing and a lot of fun. I highly recommend it.
5,A refreshing breeze of music,"I sort of stumbled onto Caillat's music while surfing the Web and loved the sweet and clever words and tune of ""Bubbly"". Thought I would do some research to find more music by Caillat. She only had 4 songs to listen to but I thought they were so refreshing and honest without the ""tragedy"" that some artists feel they need to emote to make them sound deep. Great CD to play in car, top down, sun shining on your face. Or sitting in a hammock, chillin'. Great find!"
4,New fan,"Great album...great to listen to when you need to relax while at the same time being very enjoyable, hard to choose a favorite song, but its going to have to be Tailor Made. Wonderful album!"
5,An old guy's take on Coco,"I'm 64 years old, so I probably shouldn't LIKE this music, but I do. I LOVE it, in fact. I mean I know Colby is a beautiful young girl and all, but I am NOT a dirty old man. I just like the upbeat, ""Bubbly"" quality of this music. I love that particular tune from the first time I heard it on the radio. It reminded me of the first time I heard Britney Spears in the aisle of BestBuy some years back, when her first CD came out. Loved that happy, bubble-gum sound - beFORE she broke big on the pop charts. Hopefully, Colby will conduct herself a little better. She is a very talented and gifted performer and writer; there's not a bad track on this record. Any time I want a psychic boost, I will put on her Coco CD. (And maybe Britney's first CD too.) Rock on, Colby. - Tim Bazzett"
5,Great service and quality,"I was very happy with the excellent quality of the product, especially with its low price, I was half-expecting a used, beaten-up CD. Service was excellent as well with extremely speedy delivery and pain-free payment, etc."
5,GREAT SERVICE DAUGHTER DELIGHTED,"I PURCHASED 3 CD'S FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS. SHE IS THRILLED WITH ALL 3 ITEMS AND THE PRICE PLUS FREE SHIPPING SURE WAS HELPFUL FOR THE HOLIDAYS.CocoTaking ChancesHeaven, Heartache, and the Power of Love"
1,"Coco is, well... Caca","The repetitive dronings of a mildly talented cabaret singer has never quite done it for me and this is no exception. Song after song is just plain... plain. There's something to be said for going against the trend of Lady Gaga-esque pseudo-cool donkey-pop, but unfortunately this isn't going to give you anything to inspire, nor to dwell on. It's as bland as a grey wall, in a grey house, on a grey street, on a grey day. The idea that it's light and breezy or mildly original sounds like the reviewing of ex-college-wallflowers who have found a young champion for their insipid lives. Myspace is where she emerged, like a little turtle-head 'tween the cheeks of an unhealthy adolescent, and Myspace is where she should have stayed, unlike the Kate Nash's and Feists of this world.If I had to sum up this type of 'artist' in a word, the word would be - turgid.Enjoy!"
3,nice but overrated,"I'm a long-time Fleetwood Mac fan. I was curious what Ken Caillat's daughter was up to.There are some pretty songs on this album, but the word cliche (i.e. heard that before) crosses my mind often.I particularly like ""Battle"". That one is really good. The other songs range from nice to boring.It's disturbing so many (young and inexperienced?) people give this album a 5 star rating. They obviously don't know how to value this album against other music.I'd give it 3 stars. IMHO that's a realistic rating."
1,Boring singer/songwriter.,"Coco by Colbie Caillat is a bland and uninspired disc. Colbie has a decent voice but there is no power in it, I was expecting so much more from this young artist but this album is not a standout. All the songs sound the same, boring vocals and clumsy guitar playing. Bubbly and Realize make me want to fall asleep. If you want an exciting new artist then I suggest Sara Bareilles, at least her voice and music won't make you comatose."
2,Disappointing,"I'd never heard of Coblie Caillat before, but I noticed her CD on dispay at Target's breakout artists section and was curious. I listened to some clips and decided to go ahead and buy it, but after I took it home and listened to it I was disappointed. However, the reasons I was disappointed by it may be the reaons other people find it attractive. It was very mellow, but I felt it was mellow in a flat sort of way. There just doesn't seem to be any depth or complexity to it or any real emotion. The lyrics were very predictable and repetitive. Perhaps this album is good to have on in the background when relaxing, but it's not something I enjoy when giving it my full attention."
3,Why did I buy this?,"I love the song ""Realize"" and throughly enjoy ""Bubbly."" Everything else on this album sounds like everything else I've ever heard, not to mention each other, so save yourself some money and download these two if you like them and ignore the rest. It's really not worth the money."
4,Fantastic!,Its one of those CD's you can just pop on and listen to the whole album with out having to flip from song to song. Love it!
5,Awesomely refreshing...,"Coco is pop music meets folky, laid-back...all 12 tracks on this album are consistent. Colliat does variations using Hawaiian, reggae, folk, and pop influences and combines them with her smoky and easing voice. A winner!"
4,loved it,The item arrived quickly and I would not have been able to tell it was not brand new had I not already known. Sellers like this are greatly appreciated.
4,Purchase review,"Haven't listened to this CD yet, as it is a Christmas gift. The delivery was prompt."
3,Colbie Caillat Review,"Overall good rating, I expected a little less ""Jewel sound"" and a little more pep to the songs. Good for someone dealing with relationship issues, or in some goofy love. 3 out of 5 stars.CK"
5,AWESOME,COCO IS ONE OF THOSE CD THAT YOU LOVE ALL THE SONGS. YOU CAN LISTEN TO IS ON REPLY FOR HOURS. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE OF ANY AGE.
4,good cd,This is a pretty good cd. It has a nice mixture of upbeat and slower songs. Some of the songs sound similar though. I think the cd would've been better if she had a few duets. But I think its worth getting if you enjoy her popular songs.
4,"Pleasant, Warm Debut From Caillat","Coco from Malibu, California-born Colbie Caillat is a sweet, sugary diversion that is enjoyable because it accomplishes a lot without trying too much or seeming to work too hard.That's not a knock on the production. Everything is solid here, and while no new ground is broken, it does what it sets out to do - present Ms. Caillat as a sweet, romantic, lovable presence whose voice glides through one romantic song after the other.Her hit single ""Bubbly,"" ""One Fine Wire,"" ""Midnight Bottle,"" and ""Oxygen,"" are enjoyable without the listener having to work to hard. This record is full of unadulterated sweet music that is relaxing and soothing. There is more than enough room for singers like Ms. Caillat, who don't beat us over the head with layers of meaning, or challenge us with their opinions. Coco is a welcome diversion for those of us who want something soft and sweet without any rough edges."
5,Fun music for a good mood,"Always upbeat and uplifting, this is a fun one to listen to any time. The extra cuts are worth getting the deluxe edition, though I can't say I'd buy 4 of them as another reviewer did. Nonetheless, highly recommended."
5,great listen,"If it were possible to wear out a CD simply by playing it, I would've already needed 2 more copies of this one. In a few short weeks I've listened about a million times. It's mellow - great to work to, great to chill out, too. I'm a huge Colbie fan now."
2,Not Exciting,"I liked this book a little because it showed me how a girl, about twelve years old, lived in the middle 1800's. It has a slight glimps of social history and how she felt about the borning room. I would recommend this book to those who like books which the setting takes place in the 1800's. I rate this book a two because a lot of parts I couldn't understand, and it was very boring."
4,The Borning Room Book Review,"The Borning Room is narrated by young Georgina Lott during the 1800's. Her house was built by her grandfather in 1820 with a borning room behind the kitchen. The room was used for delivering babies and for the ill to stay in so they wouldn't leave any diseses in their rooms. Georgina tackles growing up with hardships and happieness. She vows not to have babies until she witnesses her own mother deliver Zeb, her baby bother. All the happieness and greif happens in the borning room with family and friends...Paul Fleichman is the talented writer of The Borning Room who writes with a thoughtful heart. This is an easy book to read and I would recomend this book to girls who like to read about girls from the past. I enjoyed this book and hope that you'll get to read it someday and like it too!"
1,YAWN!,"In the fifth grade my teacher (you know who you are)told us that we would be reading a book caled the BORNING ROOM.""This sounds like a cool book ."" I remember saying to myself.I thouht it would be a very good book because my teacher had picked great books for us to read such as the DOLLHOUSE MURDERS.Well,I was wrong.Every one in the class called it the ""boring room."" Once you read this ,you'll see why .If your the type of person who likes to play with thier pet fish on the weekends...this book is great for you. But the rest of the people on this World ,who are intersting,I suggest you go for another choice."
3,"Great for things to do, not so for hotels and restaurants","This book is an excellent guide for things to do in the D.C. area with kids. We live in D.C. and were looking for new things to do, especially with our 3 year old in mind. We bought the book and learned about exciting locations and activites that we never knew about. For example the Doll and Toy Museum, Naval Observatory and Amazonia exhibit at the National Zoo.The restaurant and dining guides though are way off, the do not include the best food (including child friendly) nor convenient, fun and affordable hotels, infact they recommend some of the worst! Of course we've gained this knowledge from living here for 6 years, still would expect better form a guidebook...for food dining and hotels I'd recommend Lonely Planet's guide to D.C. area.Only other downer was driving to the Childrens Museum only to find it was closed until 2009. Still I have the 6th edition and the 7th edition hopefully is updated with this info."
3,A cat that can talk?,"I work hard every day... I look forward to a easy read that doesn't require much thought. I love Emily Carmichael because her books are easy reads... beach reads, if you will. But I did get a little turned off by a talking cat... I get it, but it still turned me off."
1,Substandard quality,"This product is problematic at best. It will not install until several attempts (WDM Driver message) and after rebooting, the device is not recognozed until you unplug and reconnect it. ADS Technologies Technical support is not helpful and after convincing them to attempt repair, they said a replacement was being issued, but I received the exact same unit back. The software they provide is not reliable. They claim this is compatible with Orb, however Orb is now considering removing the product from its recommended equipment list as it does not work reliably. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
5,Wow,"this album is so heavy sick and dense. the musicianship is top notch and i go as far to say this album will be considered a classic in time, albeit an overlooked classic. So you know, check it out RIFFS AHOY! ps, im aware of the lack of punctuation."
3,disappointing,"I had heard ""Razor Hoof"" and it totally blew me away so I was really excited when I finally bought this CD. I am not happy with it however because of several reasons. First all the songs sound the same. The aforementioned track, Razor Hoof, is the only song that really stands out upon the first couple of listenings. Second the production and overall sound of this album is terrible. The few guitar solos can't be heard through the wall of sludgy rhythm guitar and drums. Matt Pike isn't a good solo guitarist, so that's not necessarily a bad thing. Also the bass couldn't be heard on most of the tracks. The rhythm guitar playing and the drums are very good though."
3,OK,"The first three songs on this disc are great, the rest are pretty tired. The production is incredibly boomy and bassy which fits the music quite well."
2,Uh-oh,"I seen these guys live, not a kid, just too lazy to create an account. The guitar, bass and drums were rumbling like a freight-train. I was ready for the singer to start howling like so many of the other great stoner/sludge bands but then it happened. The vocalists opened his mouth and all I heard was grrr-rooooraoora-grrrr. Come on man the death metal thing has died. It's plenty heavy, the music is great but the singing kills it. I'll go listen to Orange Goblin, Fu Manchu, Nebula, I may find a use for High on Fire but it will probably be when I am pushing some weights. Outside of that it is too grrrro oorrrror arrra for any other use."
2,"UNA PORQUERIA, IN ENGLISH THAT MEANS....","Well, I read a few reviews, listened to the samples here on Amazon, and bought the cd. My God! Awful isnt word enough to describe this. Ok, the songs alone are ok, but when you listen to the whole cd, is when you realize that those guys doesnt know many chords, and that all the songs sound the same (a few variations), and that the vocals ARE all the same, well, you have a patetic album. Very weak, very boring, nothing new. They could do better, the lyrics are ok, but they need help, like, music lessons, even better, composition lessons. Is really bad when all the songs in your album are identical. My fellow metalheads, rockers, whatever name you want, DO NOT buy this, get a friend to loan it to you, then if you still want it, well, is your $$. But if you want real music, get Death, or Rush, hey, even Green Day is better option. In the end, High on Fire should be left for begginers in the metal world of music."
5,Ridiculous Tonnage,"Warning: this album may cause sterility, or, may undue it depending on your problem. Imagine laying in the middle of the road and having someone drop 3000 pound anvils on your face from 6 stories up. You don't die, you just keep feeling the relentless crushing of your skull. It's a wonderful joyous thing. Indulge."
2,too technical,"this book is way too technical for the common or hobby gardener. i didnt like it. there are a lot better books out there, look for those and leave this one in the stores."
2,edible landscape,"Mr Reich presents loads of plant suggestions along with the growth habits of some neat plants that I wouldn't ordinarily try. I have used these to plant little pockets of edibles all over the farm. This forces me to ""see"" a little more on my routine farm stomps,than I would normally take time for. He shares a great list of mail order sources and nice photos, as well. I will plant pawpaws next year. I thought we were too far north but what the hay- I'll try it, I have just the spot."
5,A great resource,"Morgan offers up a wide variety of mouthwatering dishes that are easy to make and (usually) don't require an extra trip to the store or a quest for some obscure ingredient. There are main course recipes for meat-eaters and vegetarians alike, and she even includes ideas for leftovers. Best of all is the brined turkey, which is life-changing. I'll never eat turkey any other way."
2,Disappointing,"While Shaw may have been a gifted playwright, his ""Saint Joan"" did an enormous disservice to the subject: the view it presents of Joan of Arc conflicts with the historical evidence on nearly every point, echoing instead the propaganda of her enemies. In truth, her trial was orchestrated by the English and their clerical allies (and even Shaw admits that the Inquisition overturned the verdict in 1456, shortly after the English were finally driven out of Rouen); nor was Joan a ""rebel"" except in the minds of her political opponents. By dredging up this fraudulent view of La Pucelle, Shaw's play was among the first popular works to undermine the efforts of countless scholars whose research had brought a more truthful view of the issue to light."
1,Felt like I was at a really bad women's retreat,"I've never been to a women's retreat (I'm a man), but from what women have told me, this book pretty well resembled a really bad one. She repeatedly criticizes the use of the mind, and talks all about our ""desires"" and letting emotions come out wherever they want to. I understand that emotions are important and part of how God has made us, but she made so many baseless assertions about how we ""overuse"" our brains in the West that I wanted to throw this book in the trash. If I didn't have to read this for class, I would have.Her chapter on the Bible really bothered me - she talked about how we shouldn't think about what Scripture means (we think about stuff too much in the West anyways!)...we should just repeat phrases from it over and over again until we have some kind of emotional experience. Terrible, terrible, terrible."
3,"Decent book, some chapters better than others...","Not a bad book. I enjoyed some chapters more than others - I think my favorite was the Sabbath chapter. I do think we're in a culture of go-go-go, and it was good to be reminded that it's important to take time for ourselves. To take a nap, take a walk, do what you want to do on your Sabbath. No errands, no busyness - just time for yourself and your family.My main problem with her was that she applied a lot of her experience to everything, as though each person's life will be similar to hers. Sometimes it overrode the message of the chapter, and made me want to skim ahead.Still a decent book, though. Highly recommend the chapter on the Sabbath, as well as the one on honoring the body."
3,Great all-in-one product; poor design,"The whistle locator is the original reason I bought this, but the feature has to be turned ON in order to activate. Now, if I KNEW when I was going to lose my keys, then I would be sure to turn on the whistle activator.The other feature is the recorder. Again, another great idea, bought it for when I was driving and needed to make a quick note, but just barely bump it in the store and every one around you hears your recording. Especially embarrassing if you were goofing around when you recorded on it."
5,Foot Comfort,"I recently purchased a Slimfit Ankle Support from Amazon and I am very pleased with the purchase. It fits so comfortably and yet doesn't pinch or roll up like some others I have tried. I have fallen arches and because I walk a lot, my legs began to bother me. Some years ago I had a Podiatrist prescribe an ankle support but unfortunately the elastic was all stretched out and ineffective. I began looking on the intenet for an ankle support and found the Slimfit at Amazon (my favorite website). I can now walk for a mile or two with no discomfort in my legs or knees. I plan to buy another Slimfit from Amazon for my other ankle/foot. You just can't go wrong with this product."
2,Doesn't provide much support,This product is lightweight and easy to get on and off. It fits well in shoes but I found I needed to wear it over a thick pair of socks to get any support at all. I have the small size but it is not small enough. My shoe size is 6 1/2 so it's not like I'm a tiny person.I will need to find an ankle support that is adjustable.
5,Magnificent!!!!!,"What can I say,Greattttt.Not only did Cuco Pena directed and addedmost of his soul to the music,the fact that Marc Anthony reallygave his best and the Scenario went back to the sixties,this pro-duction is the best I ever seen,it brought tears to my eyes to listen the beautiful music of Rafael Hernandez been sung by all this famous singers,Marc Anthony,Manuelle,Olga Tanon,Gilberto Santa Rosa,Ednita Nazario,Carlos Ponce,etc.The only regret that I have isthat is not on DVD,and my VHS is already showing signs of fatigue.Since I bought it used,it`s to be expect it."
4,"Okay, but not much about skating","In this book, Whitney and her partner Brent clash on and off the ice. But when another ice dancer threatens to steal Brent from Whitney, she realizes that she doesn't want that to happen. But will it be too late? There's not much about skating or ice dancing in this book, only when they fight on the ice. It's still good, though, and you'll laugh when you read how Whitney copes with her strange new roommate. I liked how everything patched together nicely at the end. I recommend it for readers ages 10 to 14."
4,Very comfortable....,"These are comfortable but would be even more comfortable if the insole was just a little thicker. So, if you walk a lot like I do, you might plan on buying a thicker insole but don't get the gel ones that are real thick or your heel will slip in these. (I speak from experience here!). The extra long straps are nice although the top one is almost too long and the velcro doesn't extend that far down to catch the bottom of it and it puckers out a little because of it. I get it hung on a lot of stuff. That's the reason I graded it 4 instead of 5. I never wear the soles out on propet shoes even though they have a 1,000 mile warranty. It's the upper part that I get stretched out of shape by standing on my toes so much...well, actually I don't stand on my toes but I put my feet behind me when I'm sitting at the computer and it creates the same problem. Great shoes though and very comfortable overall."
2,Good looking shoe,"The shoes were as advertised, however, the toebox is not deep enough for extended walking. The toe is more shallow than in the picture, this puts pressure on the big toe. Otherwise, it is OK. Shoe is true to size."
1,Poor quality and very poor Q/A dept,"Large lump on innersole, would be impossible to wear these shoes for any period of time, very poor quality assurance inspection.Waste of my time to even order such garbage. Amazon shame on you for not checking the quality of the shoes you recommend and sell!"
4,a little stiff,liked these shoes because they come in narrow so I don't have excess velcro going over the sides of the shoe. The shoes start out kind of stiff but do break in.
3,Sole materials do not stand up to normal wear,"The comfort is unbeatable. The shoe portion materials are high quality. HOWEVER, the outside of the ""rubber"" soles is painted to match the leather and is chipping/wearing off after several months of wear. This makes the shoe look cheap and worn out with only minimal use. The outside sole, heel, toe rubber is now two different colors. Poor craftsmanchip and materials does not stand up to normal wear"
5,Propret Prowalker,"Wonderful shoe. It runs a little wide, but it is quite comfortable. I am happy with this shoe and have ordered other shoes in this brand. We found Propet running shoes for my husband and we purchased these as well. Thank you."
4,good looking,"Nice shoes, but hard to fit if you have a medium to high arch. So, because of this I had to return them."
5,Propet Vista Walker,"Love this shoe. I have a lot of problems buying shoes which is evidenced by the number of shoes in my closet that I can not wear. I was sure I was going to return this shoe as soon as I tried it on. Only Amazon's generous return policy convinced me to try it. The shoe has a solid comfortable heel base which takes the weight off the ball of the foot. There is a generous toe area which allows the toes to move. I have a lot of problems with my feet, a bunion and neuropathy. This shoe was so comfortable, I ordered a sandal in the same brand. I haven't received the sandal yet."
5,Love this shoe,"Very comfortable, ample room in the toe box. The straps are long enough to adjust so the heel doesn't slip up and down."
3,Good value,This walking shoe is not as comfortable as they have been in the past. I would say that they run a little on the small side.
3,so-so sneaker,"I was looking for a sturdy walking shoe that had a look that didn't scream it's purpose. The fit is good, true to size. At first the shoe felt supportive but I have found it not to be an all day comfort shoe. Not sure I'd wear it to trail walk as I had hoped but it's still a great travel shoe because the Velcro strip makes it easy out and easy in when it comes to airport security. While it didn't meet my support requirement I'll be keeping it for a travel shoe since it looks good, offers medium support and easy to put on."
1,Shoes,"These shoes were not what I expected. They were not comfortable. They were big and bulky looking, very unattractive shoes. The front of the shoe is what stands out as being too big...(like clown shoes from the the front). I immediately sent them back."
3,Mac's review,"Good shoe for nurses, aides, waitress, etc. never need to worry about laces coming untied and shoes have very professional appearance. However, I wear a AFO brace and cannot fit into these shoes. I plan on returning the shoes for Propet Tour Walker that I have worn in the past with the AFO brace."
1,I have to return these- the shoe tongue is too confining-,"The shoe tongue rubs on my ankle -very irritating. I cannot wear these. I thought a 12EE would be super wide...a shoe I could put my custom made orthotics into, but they would not fit inside and the shoe was too tight and uncomfortable. If you have any swelling around the ankle at all, these shoes are not for you.You can see in the picture how close the shoe tongue is to the back of the shoe. Too close quarters for my slightly swollen ankles."
1,It's OK,"The game isn't really that cool. But, the racing part is. I was looking forward to some accident scenes. But overall, it's OK. I think Need for speed Hot Pursuit might be better."
4,Great Game...Loads of Fun!,"Really cool game, nice that they removed the free roam feature and you can now just jump straight to the race events. Overall beautifull graphics on my HDTV connected to my PS3."
1,"BORING, Next!!!",Get A Better Game This Game Has No Fun At All Looks Like Ps2 Graphics And The Cars Are Slow.
1,speed carbon,I have never recieved the game. It was a christmas present to my grandson and when it did not arrive i purchased it elsewhere. I have not received a credit yet on my crredit card.
2,Not what I expected,"I got this game due to best ratings. I didn't mind having team mates that were useless and didn't mind bias cops, but some of these races just don't make sense. I was hoping for more reason to do free roaming, but you can jump to any location which makes me lazy. The upgrades are to cheap and to easy to get. Overall this is a fun game but I really think its boring to vs the same people you just beat in the last stage yet they are like good all of a sudden. Plus I haven't played every NFS game but these chasing the person to get points is stupid to me. I have never seen it and just think it is plain bad. I like racing to be honest not tag."
4,If you like racing...,"I love the Need For Speed series. Carbon is good for the racing. The PS3 version looks much better than the PS2 version as it should but the gameplay is identical. While this title is not as good as Need For Speed Most Wanted, it adds back the drift racing that was removed from Most Wanted. I didn't really miss it that much as I'm not that good of a drift driver (though I do manage to win a few of the races by sheer luck). The pursuits are about the same as in Most Wanted, but for some reason, I enjoyed Most Wanted more. All in all, Carbon is a solid title and a good time passer until I can afford to get NFS Shift. I've got Shift on my PC and it's very much like Gran Turismo, but I'm looking forward to playing it on the PS3."
3,Ok racing game,"The game starts out a lot of fun, however, after a while the races get repetitive. Also, I'm not much of a ""drifter"", so I had no interest in the drifting parts of the game. One other pet peeve, no matter how far ahead you get, the other racers seem to catch up to you quickly, not very realistic. All in all its fun to cutomize and trade up your cars."
4,You won't believe it,"If you own the PC version and have already played it on full details there's no point buying this, if not, graphics are great!However, there's nothing to be excited about the graphics. Even if they look good they don't match up to the power of the PS3.Just have it added to your PS3 collection, you might get back to it after a while!"
4,Just good old NFS:Carbon,This is the same game you play on PC or 360 or whatever console you want. Graphics are unmodified and gameplay and storyline is exactly the same. Not much effort here :( Anyways this game is great. If you havent tried it on PC then its a must have.
3,"Fun, but a little disappointing","The first time through was pretty fun, but it was over too quickly - and forget playing through a second time (at least I had no interest). Part of the reason I got this was my understanding that you can unlock the Audi R8. You can, but you don't actually have free use of it - really idiotic in my opinion. Graphics were decent, but not really next-gen. Car selection and customization was pretty good."
2,Boring,this is the worse game eve! I mean the voice acting is good and all but if i wanted a movie i'd buy it on top of that it is nowhere as good as prostree. People say prostreet is crap but it all depend on your tast. If you look at it as gran turismo than naturally it cra. I say don't buy this game buy prostreet if you ca.
2,much too short,"Game play from the beginning is fun, but the time spent on the city layout seems a bit of a waste, considering you can just ""jump"" to any point on the map automatically. The drift races are ok but pretty easy to fake after a little practice, the crew option is pretty useless and most of all the game difficulty and length is tragic. beat the entire game over the course of a week of casual gameplay. the only redeeming aspect is quality of the cinematics (not including the acting). I wish I bought ridge racer."
4,Just a little too short.,"This is probably one of my favorite NFS games I've played so far. Almost everything about this game is awesome. It has great graphics, it's really fun, but the only problem is that it doesen't take too long to beat. The last boss you go against was still hard enough for me to have to restart a few times,(especially in the Canyon Duel) but overall it was fairly easy and short. The overall rating would've been 5 stars if it was longer and just a tad harder. But this is truely an addictive, fast, and fun racing game that should at least be rented or bought from any of you NFS fans."
4,Lots of adrenaline.,"I bought this game because I liked the movie Tokyo Drift, I was not disappointed, lots of adrenaline during the bosses races."
3,lord nelson with the marriners,"This recording left something to be desired. Some tempi are extremely fast. the editing is lousy(there are placesbetween movements that have the music start for a split second, is cut and then begins again for real.) I needed to havea recording quickly to study a score, otherwise I would have returned it for another. I was disappointed with theoverall reading, and the performance from Neville Marriner and the gang."
2,Not for everyone,"I ordered this calender when it had no description of the product with hopes that it would suit my needs. It did not, in fact I am returning it. I had no idea it would be so religious. Every page is covered in stictly Christian themes and Bible verses. Baby's first's stickers include ""First church visit"", ""Dedication"", ""First Prayer"", and ""Recieves first Bible"". I'm sure it would be a wonderful gift for avid Christian mother, ... but I would recomend another product."
3,BASIC INFORMATION W/A LITTLE WISDOM,"I've read plenty of Homer Circle's articles & have always enjoyed his unique point of view. There is very little of it here. This books is all the same info you've read in fishing magazines & seen on fishing shows. This book has 32 chapters & only the last 4 is ""Uncle Homer's"" unique wisdom. I guess I was hoping more on his opinion of traditional bass tactics rather than a how-to guide. This man is truly a pioneer of fishing whom I respect, therefore I'm not too troubled by owning this book, but I will look 4 others by him to really understand what makes him the guru of fishing."
3,Listen to wisdom,"This is an oft printed book. Homer has seen it all. What fisherman doesn't look for one more edge to outsmart today's fish which are savy to most lures? Catching more fish, dreaming of snagging the ""big one"", and being in the great outdoors are the narcotics that drive fishermen to launch their boats at every opportunity."
5,Ear Muffs also Sleep Mask,"These are great for the ears, and if you can't sleep, you also can use it as a Sleep mask year around.Dream Zone- Earth Therapeutics Sleep Mask, 1ct"
4,Fits well,Bought this for a ski trip and it fit very well. Stayed over my ears without slipping off. Made of thicker material!
3,Meh....,"Slightly too big for me, but it does the job.Cheaply made and the velcro tangles in my hair. You get what you pay for with this one."
3,"Great music, audible distortion from Amazon download",Title says it all. Music's just fine but the sound is distorted. I won't do the Amazon download again and when I have a moment will pursue with Amazon to see what's up.
3,Allure Of Sanctuary - Karen Marie Garrett,"A charming auditory experience. This is very listenable music, and the inclusion of three pieces by Erik Satie is appropriate; very good sound."
4,Lovely soothing piece for all ages.,"No regrets for this purchase. It is soothing, comforting, soaring, moody, joyful, exciting and relaxing, evokes longing and satisfaction at the same time. The only thing I can say is that it does get a little repetitive after some plays, but it is still a lovely multi-textured offering by Ms. Garrett."
2,not the picture,"I bought these based on the picture. They looked like the Benton's maple creme cookies I had gotten in the fall at the grocery store. I thought maybe another company was making them. They are fair. The frosting is tan not white; it is in the very middle of the cookie (a little bigger than a quarter dollop); the frosting taste is good but it is 1/4 to 1/2 in. from the edges of the cookie; the cookie itself is bland and tastes cheap ( shortening wise I'm not sure how to explain it). The only reason I gave them 2 stars rather than 1 is the taste of the frosting is good, what little there is."
3,Cookies great - condition poor,"We discovered Dare Maple Cookies in Canada and ordered a case when we returned to Michigan. The cookies were great, even though several boxes were less than fresh and crisp (they were soft). Another problem was that many of the cookies in each box (all the cookies in some boxes) arrived crushed. Packaging needs to be addressed."
1,"Good product, over priced","These are truly delightful cookies, but happily they are not addictive because this manufacturer (family owned or not) is pricing themselves right out of existence. In 2005, one could find them for less than $17/12 pack. In June of 2010, I bought them from Amazon for about $32 for a 12 pack. Now (Sept 2010) they are listed here at essentially $60 for the 12 pack. Almost a 4x increase in price in 5 years and doubling in a few months is beyond the pale. They've become a caviar that I will live without.9/10/2010 - to be fair to the company, the huge delta on price is because Amazon no longer carries this item but it is now through a seller. I discovered a local supermarket will provide them at $32.50 for 12. Dare Co is not culpable."
2,Cookie and cream separation,"My only complaint is that the cookies I ordered on June 19, 2010 are separated from the cream. I love the taste, but I have to piece together the cookie with the cream in order to eat it. One side of the cream is attached to a cookie and the other side is not. I shouldn't have to piece the cookie together in order to eat it. This may have been the result of a bad batch of cookies, or perhaps occurred during shipping--in any case, I am reluctant to re-order them."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"These are not as pictured on the box. They are not full of creamy white filling. The filling is dark and very thin, no where near the edge of the cookie. The maple smell and flavor is very light. No real maple taste either. I bought these after the Dollar Tree quit selling the REAL original Manning's Cookie Shop Maple Leaf Creme Cookies. These are about like the cheap knockoffs that Interbake Foods produces and sold for a short time at the D.T. These were packaged excellent. Processing was very slow. 8 days for processing, 2 for shipping. ALSO had attempted fraud problems with my c.c. after this order. I would not recommend this product or the related companies (Dare foods,Foodservice Direct) to anyone."
3,Better than I thought,I watched sub-mariner when I was 8 years old. The animation was better then what I remembered. If your a cartoon buff you will enjoy the video. It's a little corny but still interesting. The villians were good to.
2,Subby doesn't float,"I've seen two of the ""classic"" Marvel cartoons: Hulk and Subby. Hulk's better (and I'm not saying that just because I'm biased). These cartoons are boring. The only funny thing about them is that, unlike the comic book, the animators tried to make the atmosphere more watery: air bubbles constantly being emitted every time a character speaks and dorky 3rd grade schooler fish which cut across the screen at the most dramatic moments. This is not good storytelling, not good presenting, not good animation. But if you like water, I mean really like water, you might like this."
4,a rich photo history of ww2 flight jackets,"maguires book is a stunning photo reference of world war two flight jackets. heavy emphasis is placed on the ""art"" aspect focusing on the individual art that ww2 air crewman chose to adorn their flight jackets. there are many color photographs as this is the books focus, the weakness of the book comes from it's lack of text. there is not much here for someone who wants to read about the subject, just lots of full color photographs....and frankly for this edition thats good enough. the definitive flight jacket book hasn't yet been written."
4,hmmm?,"Dry and Heavy are Shigemoto Nano (DRY/ drums) and Takeshi Akimiti (HEAVY/ bass). This is their 3rd album, the previous being dubbed out by the legendary King Jammy (King Jammy meet D&H; in the jaws of the tiger). The 1st containing that great track ""love the life"".This album rocks. The bass lines are heavy. The drums are heavy. There's Mark Knophleresk guitar lines. There's 'Engrish' lyrics, by Likkle Mai and Ao Inoue who name check the big dub guns- King Tubby in particular. There are lyrics concerning globalisation, somewhat ironically, on Bright Shinning Star. The album contains a inspired-dub-that's-not-as-cheesy-as-it-should-be of the Doors 'riders on the storm'.If you like the old dub masters, or the new Twilight Circus dub experiments you should be into Dry and Heavy. See them live, apparently their Mr Scruffs best live bands, and get the dub version of this album on Beat records."
2,Worked Fine at First...,"For the first few weeks or so of using this product, I was really pleased with the results. After a while, it left so much build-up on everything I used... My flat iron had a disgusting brown film around the edges and even my hair started feeling dirty... I would only use a dime sized amount and I have long hair. Even washing my hair a few times wouldn't get it as clean as it should have been. Needless to say, I've stopped using this product."
3,The 'talk' about CHI silk infusion,"I'm a young, afro-american women in my twenties... I have nice, wavy long hair and am very hesitant in introducing new products to my hair. I sometimes use Garnier Fructis and Cholesterol hot oil treatment. Before purchasing this product, I read many reviews about how great it was and how satisfied customers were with the results. I don't believe it's 'bad' but I don't know... not too thrilled. My hair feels and look great when I first get my hair done and use it, but right after, it feels weighed done and heavy and the split ends seems to be a lot more now than before. I might stop using it, may not be right for me."
4,Love it,"At first i thought this was one of the more expensive products that i bought, but it definitely gives my hair a silky feel, smells good, and only need a small amount to do the job, so it is worth the money."
2,Big disappointment.....:-(,I bought this product just to give it a try and I did not like it. I will not be buying this product again because it did not soften my hair like the biosilk silk therapy serum did. Biosilk is alot better.
3,good... but,if you want real nice results with this product you must use a really tiny drop unless you want your hair to be heavy and greasy... i only recomend this item for people who has veeery dry hair.
4,Great Hair Treatment Product!,"CHI Silk Infusion is a great hair product that adds shine and touchable softness to the hair. It has improved the quality of my hair. I love using this as a heat protectant too because it keeps my hair from becoming too dry and damaged.One of the bad things about using this product is that it makes the hair appear more oily than it really is. I advise that you do not apply the product near your hair roots.Other than that, I definitely recommend this to everyone! Girls AND Guys! :)"
5,Chi Silk Infusion,I Love this product and I use it daily. I found it on this site for cheap and bought more.
2,Something different the second time,"I started using this product a year ago and was amazed with the results! I didnt have much complain about my hair but was using it to improve its quality and add extra shine and softness during straightening. Well, I stopped using it at the begining of the summer then purchased it again because my hair was in bad condition (dryness). So, all pumped up and excited to get back to it, I exprienced the biggest disappointment. I realized it was drying out my hair and didnt give it any shine even after flat iron. I honestly dont know why this had happened, but considering my second try, I do not recommend this product. By the way, I have fine, slightly wavy hair with a frizzy and dry section on top"
5,*Shine*,"A little dab definitely goes a long way. I put it on while my hair is still wet then blow dry it. Leaves hair soft, shiney and not at all greasy looking. Love, love, love it!!!!!"
4,Review of purchase,"While my book arrived by the time it was stated I had ordered several items from different amazon sellers. All of these arrived a week earlier. When I contacted the seller twice there was no response, but to be fair I did tell them once I received the book, it was okay not to respond. However, other amazon sellers have gone above and beyond to make sure to communicate and send things out quickly. In fact this seller was in the same state as I was, but took longer than anyone else to get my order to me. Also they did not send an email confirmation of shipping date."
3,Went Up in Price,"Went up from $8.47 to $9.99 since I bought it...would probably pay the cheaper price, but not the new price. The seed is mostly millet, with a few oats and birdy nutrition pellets thrown in. It's okay if your bird likes millet, but this food should probably be a base instead of a full feed (since millet is all empty calories and no nutrition.) You do get a lot, and it's a fair deal for bird owners on a budget, though."
5,Treasurer of Flower Designs,"I use this book on a regular basis. I am an artist, pyrographer and woodcarver and find this book to be of great value. W.J.Cousins, CA"
5,Treasury of Flower designs,"""Terrific....wife loves it. Many projects are in the making, ideas running amok in her head, take pity on me, Quilting Widower."""
4,Look Elsewhere,"An extremely worthwhile session, with Johnny Griffin joining Bill Hardman and Jackie McLean. But you can find it on the currently in-print two-fer on the Collectables label: Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers play ""A Night in Tunisia"" and ""Lerner and Loewe"" [sic]. Look for this potent package at Oldies.com if you have trouble finding it on Amazon. The second session is even stronger than the first. Together, five stars is too few to do them justice."
3,Just ok...,"I received this to try through Bzz Agent. I liked a lot of things about it, but did not love it. It is ""fragrance-free"", but still has a faint smell that is kind of pleasant. I think it must be the cotton. The cleanser is a little thick and hard to get off my skin, but my skin feels great after I am done washing my face. It leaves my skin feeling very clean and moisturized. I'm just not sure how much of my makeup it actually removes. I use white washcloths and feel like there is quite a bit on the cloth after I have washed my face. I don't want to spend that much time getting cleanser off my face if it doesn't remove my makeup."
4,great product,i am a Bzzagent and was excited to recieve this product. i was suprised that The Burt's Bees sensitive skin products are all natural and made from cotton extract. My face is very sensitive and I normally have red skin on my forehead as well as on my cheeks and everything breaks me out. These products do not cause my face to turn red at all. My skin is soft and not dry or oily after using this product. i also loved the smell of it . the downside it didnt take my makeup off :(
4,Cleanses without drying,"I just got this product through a bzz campaign, and I must say I really like it. My skin tends to get really dry and sensitive in the colder months and whenever the weather changes, but since I've been using this product, my skin never feels dry after washing. I love that it contains mostly natural ingredients also. All the chemicals in other face washes bother me because I don't know what I'm putting on my face, so this is a nice change! It's creamy and gentle while also being an effective cleanser. As long as I supplement with another product for blemishes, I'm all set!"
5,love this stuff,"I have been buying this cleanser for years. It has a gel consistency. I squeeze about a quarter inch onto my fingers then wet with water, rub onto my face and rinse off. It cleans without drying and I love the fresh orance scent. I have been using this product for about 5 years. My skin stays soft and breakouts have become a thing of the past. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone."
3,Wanted to like it....,"In our house we LOVE all things Burt's Bee's but this cleanser feels greasy and waxy. Both times it was used, my face broke out in a line of zit's. Won't stop buying Burt's Bee's products - but won't ever buy this facial cleanser again."
5,"Love this brand, great productive for sensitive skin","I have incredibly sensitive combination skin on the face (oily in some spots, dry in others), and my husband has normal oily skin. This product did wonders for both of us surprisingly. It was able to moisturize my dry spots and help reduce the oil on the oily parts.I love that Burt's Bees is made in America, and not tested on animals.I love this face wash, i love this brand."
5,Great Stuff!,"I have found that this is the one product that does help cleanse my skin without drying it out. I do feel like I have a film leftover, but if you do the full regiment, it comes right off. (The toner cleans it off for me). Great product and smells wonderful!"
5,I LOVE IT,"I cannot tolerate the fragrance/parfum of most all Burt's Bees ""natural"" products, but this one has none of that, just orange oil and natural stuff, and my skin ADORES it. I use it in a hot bath and let it soak into my skin, then rinse in the shower. It almost acts as moisturizer on it's own, but not quite (at least on my skin). The other reviewer called it ""sticky,"" but maybe it just takes getting used to. I rub it in, let it sit, and rinse it off. It may leave a trace of itself, but nothing that feels greasy when you dry off or anything ... just fresh, glowing, moist skin. I find this stuff is a DREAM to use. I recommend it highly, and I am extremely picky."
3,Not too bad ...not too good,"I like this product, but don't love it. I use a lot of Burts products and love 90% of them. PLUS-it smells terrific, like you just peeled an orange in your shower/ if my skin is feeling really dry it does feel better after I use it. MINUS-it feels really oily to me, and sometimes I feel like it doesn't rinse off well/ it doesn't lather at all...I personally like a lather. This would probably be best for people with really dry skin."
3,Smooth,"I recieved a full size sample of Burt's Bees sensitive skin cleanser through Bzz Agent. This product is very creamy and smooth. It leaves the skin feeling soft. There is no redness or tingling with this product. However, I do agree with other's reviews that if you have acne prone skin this probably isn't for you. I have been breaking out and have consistently been using this product for 3 weeks and it seems to be getting worse. I would have hoped that it would have helped with break outs but it hasn't."
3,Just alright,"I received this product as a sample share as a buzz agent. I was very excited to try this product as I really like Burts Bees products. This is an ok product, it does leave my skin feeling soft, but I wish it had an acne agent in it. It has a little smell to it, it's not over powering or anything, smells almost like clay or something. I broke out really bad after using this product for the first week, I'm assuming it was just cleaning my skin from all the impurities and bringing them to the surface. My face has cleared up fairly well since then. The texture is pretty good, very smooth. I do have a bump on face, not sure if it's from the product or not. I'd say overall it's just an ok product."
3,"Nice, but...","This cleanser is nice and thick. It smells good and is all natural, just what we expect from Burt's Bees. It doesn't irritate my skin, but it doesn't clear up my break outs either. It doesn't seem to prevent new breakouts and my skin doesn't feel clean after using it."
2,Not good for removing makeup,"I am somewhat unsure about this cleanser. I like that its super moisturizing. But I wouldn't use this alone if i was wearing makeup although it says it removes makeup. This is also true for most cleansers anyway)I used the makeup remover wipe before using this cleanser to remove makeup. But when i used the astringent soaked cotton pad to wipe my face after cleansing my face, there was makeup residue on the cotton pad. I like using this when I have no makeup or using it before using foam cleanser if I have makeup to remove.*I received this product from buzzagent to review."
1,Ugh. Is this really soap?,"This product does not rinse from the face- it is supposed to, but after about three minutes of working with water, it just wasn't coming off. I gave up and wiped it off with kleenex- an orange greasiness came off onto the sheets. Maybe if your face is REALLY dry or your skin can't handle soap, you could try this. But if your face is just somewhat dry or you like a clean feeling when done washing your face, this isn't the product for you.But it smells good."
1,I wouldn't purchase this item again,"I have been used many organic brand items so far. This one was very disappointing. I can not remove my make up with this cleanser when I remove my make up with this one, it still remain make up on my face. Also I don't feel like I washed my face at all. Yes, I know. It is a cleanser for sensitive skin but maybe this is too sensitive. It doesn't work at all for me."
3,Well,I got Burt's bees a nd I liked the product because it did not dry my skin or irritate it. Now the product is done and I will not continue using it because it didn't remove any of my blackheads. I have moved on to using another brand of cleanser.
4,Great product - Reasonable price!,"I have had the privilege to try this Facial Cleanser for my Person opinion provided by BzzAgent.com. I was so excited to get my Kit to try Burt's Bees Products. I have never Tried any of Burt's Bees Products so this review was even more exciting for me. I have extremely sensitive skin so I'm very picky on what products I use on my face. The day the Burt's Bees Box arrived I used the Facial cleanser. I have used it now for a week. So far I have noticed softer skin, less redness and my skin just looks better. My pores are smaller and the skin looks brighter. Overall, I am very pleased with the products in the Burt's Bees Natural Skin Solutions for Sensitive Skin line. I found Burt's Bees to offer high quality products at reasonable prices."
4,Great for my sensitive skin,"I actually purchased this instead of receiving as a sample or trial, and I will continue to buy it! This product is great for my very sensitive skin that's prone to getting too dry after using most cleansers. This thick, creamy wash gently removes dirt and most make-up and leaves my skin still feeling soft. I'm very glad it does not have an acne-fighting or ""skin clarifying"" agent in it, as those tend to antagonize my skin as well. This is truly a sensitive skin cleanser - it cleans without stripping, stinging, or burning, and still leaves skin soft.I would recommend using a separate eye make-up remover, though. While this cleanser did remove most of my light eye make-up, eyeliner and mascara (particularly waterproof versions) seem to be a challenge for it. I've woken up with more under my eyes in the morning than I thought was there at night after washing my face.All in all, a great bargain for those of us who have delicate, sensitive skin!"
3,Well priced all natural product,"Unlike some of my fellow bzzagents, I actually liked this product. I too was part of this campaign and received a freebie to try out. Everyone in my household tried it and we all agreed it worked for us. It has a smooth, creamy texture which has no fragrance. I prefer a creamy face wash that doesn't foam up as it doesn't strip my skin and yes, I do get redness when I find a product that does not do well with my sensitive skin. I found that it washed off well and left my skin smooth and clean. Although, I have to say that the first time I used it, it felt a little sticky but after that initial use, there was nothing untoward about it. Both male and female have tried it here and everyone who tried it liked it, even those without sensitive skin like mine. A little bit goes a long way and the price can't be beat so I would recommend that people at the very least, give it a try."
1,Terrible product,"I hated this product. First of all, this product is super hard to rinse off your face. It is really thick. Once finally getting this stuff off my face, my face felt unclean, like there was a film still on it. It didn't leave me refreshed at all. I will say though, I didn't have any skin reaction to this product nor did it cause breakouts. It just felt gross. I got this product free to try and it still ended up in the garbage can."
1,keep looking,"My husband and I were both disappointed with this face wash. I use very little make up (tinted moisturizer, some powder, mascara) and after washing my face with this product my skin actually felt greasier. I had to use multiple cotton swabs loaded with toner for my skin to feel and look clean afterwards. my husband - who obviously doesn't wear make up :) - broke out and felt the same greasiness after using it, too. we stuck with the face wash (and the tons of cotton swabs/toner routine) because we couldn't convince ourselves to throw away $10... but we can't wait until we run out so we can buy something else!"
1,too sticky,"Normally I love Burt's Bees, but this face wash is too sticky. I had to wash my face again with my regular stuff to get it off. Granted, it smells good, but it's not worth it."
2,Very greasy cleanser,This Burt's Bees cleanser left my skin feeling greasier after I used it than it was before.I have normal-oily skin and this is definitely not a good cleanser for that skin type. This cleanser might work really well if you had very dry skin.It does smell nice though.
2,"Love Burt's Bees, but not this cleanser","In general, I'm a fan of Burt's Bees products, and I have sensitive skin, so I was really excited to try this product as a BzzAgent (I received a complimentary sample as a BzzAgent). The Natural Skin Solutions Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser is a cream cleanser - it's soap-free and non-foaming. Since I normally use a foaming cleanser (Olay Sensitive), this was a little hard to get used to. The texture of the product is nice and creamy, and it's fragrance free. It goes on nicely, but it seems hard to rinse. Since using it, I notice I'm getting more frequent breakouts. I can't say for certain that it's related to this cleanser, but the breakouts began within a couple of days of beginning to use it."
4,Use only a dab!,"This cleanser is all-natural, which is the best part. It's texture is also very thick and creamy, so you only need a tiny dab to clean your face. The 6 ounces will last a long time!"
2,Disappointed,"I received this product along with the moisturizer through BuzzAgent to try and share my opinion. I was really excited to get it because I love Burt Bee's products. After giving it two weeks of use however, I had to call it quits. This is just not a good product. My first complaint is that the face wash is supposed to be sent free but yet smells like school glue and I found that bothersome. It seems to be thick coming out of the tube but did not cleanse my face at all, leaving a residue behind with the make up it failed to remove. Also the moisturizer does not soak in to your skin but only stays on top of it until it eventually dries. After a two weeks and a few break outs I just can't continue to use this product. I really did want to like it and I hope that they can improve on it for the future, but I think I will be sticking to my usual face wash and moisturizer for now. Now, Burt Bee's lip balms and hand lotions? I will always be a loyal fan of those."
2,Disappointed in Burts Bees,"My first complaint about this product is the smell of the cleanser! Phew, I know there have to be some natural products they can put in to make the smell a bit better. My second complaint it the packaging. Whenever I just try to squeeze out just a little, enough comes out to wash my whole body!!! For the price I wouldn't want to waste that much (even though I did receive this as a sample. The plus sides: My skin did not react to the cleanser or the moisturizer. In fact, I haven't had a break out since I started using it. I just have to decide if that's worth the smell and waste of product."
4,Great product for a great price,"I am also a BzzAgent and received a complimentary Burt's Bees Sensitive Skin Solutions facial cleanser and daily moisturizing cream and LOVE it. I am pretty snobby when it comes to facial products and was sceptical when I received this product but have to say I liked it from the start. I don't care for heavy fragrances and this one has a very light scent. My skin is very sensitive and after weeks of using no problems and no breakouts. This product worked well at taking my makeup off, I used it to take off my ""kiss"" face makeup after halloween and it worked great- took all the white and black off in one application. I love that it's thick and moisturizing. I think it's the first cleanser that doesn't leave my face feeling like it was crying for moisture, I hate that feeling!Give Burt's a try, you might just stop using your Kiehls like I have."
1,Not for me,"I received this product free as a BuzzAgent. I used it for 3 days and had to quit using it. It made my skin feel unclean and dull. After the second day my skin started becoming irritated and itchy. I like that the ingredients are natural and that it is made by a brand that I love, but it just didn't work for me. I noticed it didn't remove makeup as well as other face cleansers. Overall this was a huge letdown."
4,"Natural, and didn't break me out...","I'm currently on topical acne meds so my skin is super sensitive and I cannot use my usual glycolic cleanser. I received Burts Bees sensitive Facial Cleaser because I'm a BzzAgent, and it came at the right time. I needed a moisturizing cleanser and I prefer using natural products on my skin and hair when possible. I didn't experience burning like I did with the Neutrogena Naturals products, and being on a differin/duac cocktail my skin tends to need the extra moisture that this provides. I haven't use it as to remove makeup however, it does cleanse the residual makeup left after I use a makeup removal wipe. Doesn't lather up, and because its soap free don't expect that tight ""clean"" (stripped) feeling you'd feel with cleansers that contain soap. Overall, I'd recommend this for someone who needs a cleanser that moisturizes and doesn't need that stripped feeling that comes with using soap based products."
3,"Leaves Skin Soft and Clean, but doesn't FEEL like a cleanser","I was able to try Burt's Bees Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser as part of a BzzCampaign. I have always been a big fan of Burt's Bees and also natural products. As a person with psoriasis, though in remission, I have to be careful with what I put on my skin. I was confident using this product. My skin is left feeling clean, soft and smooth, but as I was using it it just didn't FEEL like a cleanser. I am missing the lather of a cleanser. It may just take some getting used to. I love the scent. It is light and almost smells like oatmeal. I have been satisfied with the product, but it isn't my new ""go to."""
2,Didn't remove all my makeup,"I have oily, sensitive skin and I wear foundation every day. Olay Foaming Face Wash for sensitive skin has worked well for me for the past few years, but I have been wanting to try something more natural. I already use Burt's Bees toner, and I was given a chance to try this Burt's Bees Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser for free through BzzAgent. This is not a foaming cleanser; it's more of a creamy consistency. I like the fact that it's fragrance free and has natural ingredients, but this just doesn't remove all my makeup. It doesn't seem to do much more than water alone. It does seem very moisturizing, and could be a good choice for someone with dry skin or who doesn't wear makeup, but it does not work for me."
3,What Happened,"Ok, Dorinda was the bomb, but this video sucked, If you going to do something live, we want to see it live. This whole video was editied really bad. When Dorinda stop singing they still was playing the CD version, when she was singing they were playing the cd version and they werent ,matching. The worst song was nobody but God because she was singing and they completely edited her voice and you couldnt hear nothing but you could see her singing. This was worst then One Last Time DVD. I will never buy another live dvd unless i know for sure its not going to be edited. I want to hear the mess ups and the cracking of the voice."
1,No new scences,"I have all Michael's videos, I have all Bulls videos..and I thought this one would be different. Maybe the last video we'll ever see about Michael and this dinasty, and the did it with all scences from past videos. Ive seen all before! , nothing new? scences from air time, playground, bulls videos, come fly with me, above and beyond..nothing new! I think that nobody showed anything about last championship run (I mean the locker room scences after the title, grant park, or something different) Im very dissapointed"
3,More of the same from Jordan.,BOTTOM LINE:Just more highlights from his career up to his first retirement and his comeback. Nothing that any fan doesn't know about. still fun to watch Jordan dominate tho! ;-)
4,Good enough.,This video is brilliant for getting a general picture of the the career of the legend that is Michael Jordan. However if you are a MJ groupy like me and you've seen all of his previous vids then there isn't much in this that hasn't been seen before. Still a great video and a must buy for die hard MJ fans.
5,Gorgeous!,"This pattern just sings the bounty of nature. The rich colors and the realism of the fruit and, yes insects, there are depiction of the gardener's friends bees and butterfly's, is stunning.I mix some of the pieces of this set with my off white standard pieces and sterling flatware for an elegant yet provincial grace on my table.I adore it and my guest have been enchanted by this interesting and lovely pattern. If they have been put off by the orchard friendly insects, it has not dulled their appetites, not their converstaion and delight with the motif.5 Stars for a great set to mix and match with other solid or patterned pieces!"
2,so so,"I bought this for my son's. maybe too complicated. I don't know. they are 10 and 6. graphics are pretty cool, although golden boy didn't look like himself. they seem to play it once in awhile and the screen gets too dark and you can hardly see the guy your fighting against. If it were a great game the boys would be playing it all the time. I recommend to older kids"
3,"GREAT game, long waits","This game is one of the best boxing games I've EVER played - however, the load times are ridiculous. You'd think they would make better use of the PS3's hard drive to reduce this, but alas, they didn't. At times it feels like you have to wait for the game to load after every punch (see Playstation 1 vs. Sega Saturn), which is what puts a real damper on the gameplay - just when you're hyped up for the next fight, you have to get up, grab a drink, use the restroom. then sit and wait some more... Fun: 10 out of 10. Gameplay: 2 out of 10 just because of the load times."
3,Good Game,the game is very very difficult but playing with two players it really Rocks punch out your friend any way you want enjoy the classic fights with ALi and Frasier play with all the top heads and heavyweights of all times
4,Great game,"Ahead of its time. Looks and plays a lot better than some current titles..Not really a boxing fan, but quick learning curve."
5,very realistic,"This game is lots of fun and very realistic when you use the ""in the ring"" view! The game designers did an excellent job!!"
2,First PS3 boxing experience a disaster,"Maybe I'm just a little too picky about my controls, but I found those used in this game to be needlessly complex and extremely difficult to use. While the graphics are very good, I found Fight Night Round 3 to be lacking in virtually all other respects. In the times I've played it I succeeded in little more than being a punching bag for the computer generated fighters. I generally consider myself to be pretty good at video games, but this was one I just couldn't master or even get into. Rent it before you buy."
1,this game sucks dont like,THIS GAME SHOULD NEVER BEING MADE YOU CAN EVEN SEE YOURSELF AND YOU TRY HITTING YOU OPPONENT I DONT RECOMEND
4,Best boxing game ever.,"Probably the best boxing game ever, graphics might not be as advance as the new games are. But when it comes to pure boxing is the closest to the real thing."
4,Fright Night 3 packs a punch,"Fight Night 3 was the first video game I bought for my PS3. I bought the game because I played it with a friend before and had fun with it. Now that the months have passed I have no interest in picking it up. But the game itself was great during the time I was playing it.The manager mode of the game is actually really entertaining, except for the training mode. Training mode got boring after a while, but the fights were fun.The best part of Fight Night Round 3 is playing it with other people. The classic Ali vs. Frazier is a must when you play with friends. It is fun to watch how much you were able to beat up your opponent during the recovery time of the game. Also I like how the game handles it when one gets knocked out in compared to Round 4.The graphics are not better than Round 4 but the game play surely is. If you want a game to have fun with for a pretty good amount of hours either alone or with someone Round 3 is the game for you."
2,Long load times kill it for me,"This is one of the finest boxing games available on the PS3, especially for the graphics and controls. The AI can be rewarding/challenging and you may find yourself picking up on some strategy early on. The 'build your fighter' option is highly customizable and the training can be as fun as the boxing.. kindof like a minigame.What destroys this game is the extremely long load times on the main menu and between fights. It's literally 4 or 5 seconds wait time, ever single time you move to another option in the main menu. This may not kill it for everyone, but I'd warn that you rent this game first to see if you can handle it.I've got Fight Night Round 4 now.. equally good gameplay but without the excessive load/wait times and it does seem to be a more straightforward, professional title over Round 3.-- you can get this game for $10-$15 used just about everywhere -- but I recommend that you use that money towards Round 4 if you have to have a boxing game."
2,Now wonder it is selling for 6 bucks,This game is very poorly programmed. The judges make huge errors on the scoring and statistics. The announcer makes incorrect comments during the fight. The replays are completly the opposite of what the announcer is saying. The game keeps saying it can not connect yet all other games and internet work fine. There is no update system. The menu system is very unintuitive and boring. The music stinks unless you like rap. The controller is very difficult to master or sometimes does not do what it is suppose to. The load times are slow. The game has crashed my system a few times. I have still managed to have some fun so I gave it a very generous 3. I could have given more details but with all these flaws it would have been extremely long winded.
2,Fight night PS2 Vs PS3,"After owning Fight Night 3 for PS2 and playing it a lot, I did 6 career modes in different weights and losing it to a so called friend, I got the PS3 a few days ago and of course one of my favorite games was just there in the stand so I bought it for PS3.I cant believe how disappointed I am, the fighters take time to appear, like after you finish training, there are a lot of glitches, specially when you knock them down, in the store some times is difficult to read, red letters over red background.The only new things are the sweat of the fighters, the models that have tattoos, and new haircuts, and that is it.Save yourself some money and buy it for PS2 and play it on your ps3 you will have a better experience.The game is excellent for PS2 standards for ps3 not that is why I give 2 stars."
3,Good game but...,"This is a good game but have some misses. The Load Times are too high and the carrer mode is nothing awesome. The Support of EA is very bad, I can't play on Network becasuse the EA servers are not available and the EA can't help me to solve that problem."
3,They slip or grab on the bar!,"I own two of these in my collection of assorted clamps and brands. One of them tends to slip all the time when trying to tighten the screw, or will not slide when you want it to, for quick adjustment. Very disappointed and I will stick with Bessey, Scott Phillips or Jorgensen."
5,Very valuable.,"This book contains a history of evolving religious experience both Christian and otherwise. For anyone interested in the development ethics and religious experience it is one of the best sources (sources on the history of dogma are very common, but this is different).I am convinced that if terminology is confusing that readers will find that they can penetrate the book with a dictionary, and that the book will help them select primary sources to study to enhance their comprehension of the period."
4,Pagans and Christians,Advert said slight damage on the dust cover. It was slight and nothing like a problem. The book is in excellent condition. Very good value for the money
2,a frustrating book,"I read the authors book: THE UNAUTHORIZED VERSION and found it to be well written and enlightening. When I read the book: PAGANS AND CHRISTIANS I found it to be incomprehensible and dull. After reading 170 pages I gave up in frustration. A year later I tried to read it again and got to page 180, before I gave up. Then I decided to go to the second section on Christianity to see if it improved, but it was as meandering and frustrating as the first part."
4,Early Rostnikov,"The late Stuart M. Kaminsky's BLACK KNIGHT IN RED SQUARE is the second installment in his Russian series. Chief Inspector Rostnikov, fresh off his last case and is plunged into a hunt for terrorists who would embarrass the Soviet Union during a major film festival.He enters a dual of wits with Drozhkin of the KGB who controls Rostnikov's son and wishes to have no fallout leveled at the KGB. This book was nominated for an Edgar Award and a later book of the series, A COLD RED SUNRISE won the Edgar for the best mystery novel published in 1988.Each book in the series is well worth the reader's time and Kaminsky takes you into life in the Soviet Union with deft strokes.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS."
4,Pass on Your Favorites,"There's Columbo, there's Maigret, and then there's Inspector Rostnikov. After reading one, you'll compulsively go back to the beginning to get them all in the ""correct"" order. This second in the series continues the process of developing the characters you will come to love. I am now going back and purchasing the series for my son, who is as addicted as I am, to the stories of the persistant senior Inspector with a brain, a conscience, a Jewish wife, and a bum leg. Equally as compelling as the mysteries and the team of detectives is the evolving background of life and change in Russia from the Cold War to the present."
1,My Review,"This item was sent incorrectly, the contents did not match the product. A completely different tape was sent instead of the listed title."
5,TWO THUMBS UP!!!!,I read this book many!!! years ago and regret I ever loaned it to a friend. (they never returned it) It took me a long time to ever find it again as it is out of print. I think this is her best work and there should be more writers with her talent
5,Witch/warrior campaign against evil,"Unfortunately I have not read this book in too long. However, it has been one of my favorites, and I have read it many times. It's a fabulous book and I've always been unhappy that there werent more sequels. Lyn Abbey brought a new world, a new magic system to life, as she does so well, and characters that are believable and act true to their nature. It seems to be a flaw of hers (the wooden sword, beneath the web) that she gets me going and then wont write the rest of the sequels! any of these books is worth an eddings like string of sequels to further develop the world. my one complaint is that lynn abbey doesnt write more!"
5,A beautyful present for letter-lovers,"In the age of the internet, there are certainly still people around you who love the art of writing on real paper with real ink. Even if you think they should have been born during the 18th century, they might deserve this beautiful and inspiring book as a present. You might even want to receive one of their letters in the end..."
4,1st time Nan Ryan Reader,"I really enjoyed this book, so much so that two weeks later I found myself reading it yet again. I think the storyline and the people were written well and the situations being what they were could truely have happened, this is not about fantasy this is right out of a day in the life. At least that is how I feel, I'm going to check out more of Nan Ryans works because of this wonderful treat"
3,"Not bad, Not Great","This is my first Nan Ryan book. All I could say is that the story is O.K. I kept waiting for something to happen. Ofcourse things happened but it was related in a manor that still kept me anticipating a punchline. Ryan just told us issues were resolved. The hero/heroine are O.K at the beginning, but after they confess there love to each other the story seems to flatline (and that is somewhere in the middle of the book) This is one of those books that are entertaining enough to read but will be forgotten as soon as the book is closed. I just felt that the author never delivered the final surge of satisfaction that I would normally get from reading a really good book. I recommend that this book be taken out of the library, because it is not really a keeper, but interesting enough to be read."
1,[BORING!],"I have read most of all of Nan Ryan's books. This one was terrible! The herione was so boring I found myself dozing off. The ""hero"" if you wants to call him that was too cocky and just plain boring as the herione. There was no action no adventure just a lot of COMPLETELY SNORE [adult relations]. I always read Amazon.com reviews when I'm about to buy a book... I should've listened to the others comments because this book [is bad]!!!!"
3,Product Image is Misleading,"The product image is what I had bought previously (Botanical Unscented Deodorant) and worked perfectly, but what was sent to me was Unscented Clear Deodorant, and although the base ingredients are similar, they are not the same nor do they work equally. I must use alcohol first before applying this product or it completely backfires in less than an hour. No deodorant for days would work better than the backfire effect."
1,Useless as an Introduction,"As a avid reader of books on evolutionary psychology and sociobiology, and a foreign language graduate, I thought I would be able to cope with the degree of difficulty of this ""Introduction"". In fact, I gave up trying one third into the book. Not only are the technical terms not defined, but any attempt to derive their meaning or establish relationships between concepts failed.Much of the argument is enigmatic rather than explanatory. Many utterances seem to be drawn out of context.At least as an introduction to a difficult subject, there's nothing for it but to regard this book as a failure."
1,Title Of Review,"I bought this book at the book store which didn't have any of Chomskys political books (I wonder why). All there was was this one which had some of Chomskys ideas. The majority of the content in this book is about linguistics. To tell the truth, I didn't really know what linguistics was until I got this book. I agree with the other reviewer who said that this book didn't explain all the technical terms too well, or at all. I finished this book with hardly anything learned about linguistics. The Social Critic section didn't define too many terms either, but I already knew most of it so it was ok. Next time I'll buy a real Chomsky book because I like his essays that I find online, but this book wasn't so great, but then again, it also wasn't written by him."
3,NOT Chomsky for Dummies,"This is a good introduction for beginners. It is not however a dumbed-down version with pictures used to replace useful textÑalthough I found the repetition of certain pictures (ones of Chomsky and the author...) a little tedious, it starts you down the road with the basics of linguistics so you can understand how his expertise affects his political views on media and government. It started me off right as an individual looking for some more information about the man and his work. This whole series seems like it would be great in a middle or high school classroom for a teacher who wants to open her students' eyes to alternative perspectives on media, language, and politics."
1,Exclusively for DVD: Amazon description is wrong,"I ordered this item to use for my DVD, CD, CDROM players based on the description above that says it is Mac and IBM compatible and can be used in DVD and CD players. But on the outside of the package, which I didn't see until it arrived, it says clearly: EXCLUSIVELY FOR DVD.Not being an expert, I decided to return it.I notified them of this mistake weeks ago, but I see it has not been corrected. If buying this in the store, the buyer could easily seen the package, so it wouldn't be a problem, but I think an online description should be more adequate."
5,It's long overdue!,"Mitchell Jones has long been the ""un-sung"" hero of gospel music. With his group Commissioned (the baddest, most influential gospel group in history!) Mitch wrote, produced, and sang some all the all time greatest songs.This CD introduces those songs to a whole new generation with updated arrangements and musicianship. AND Mitch's signature smooth vocals. I appreciate the re-arrangements of some of my favorites like Cry on, Ordinary Just Won't do, and I am here.This CD also introduces a few tracks from his upcoming P&W; release. I love the song ""Breathe"" and Mitch's rendition is one of the best I've heard.PICK THIS UP! You won't be disappointed."
5,Still on his mission,"I have been a commissioned fan since there first album back in the early 80's when I was a kid. This album is nothing less than what they have produced in the past, ""Amazing"" Mitchell has amazing vocal skills. I can't stop praising the lord. Thanks Mitchell for continuing your mission. I will support you to the end."
3,"It's a light, what can I say?",Not much to review here. Standard lighting fixture. Came with everything needed to install it. Worked just fine. No problems.
3,A book with information about creating a natural home,"This is a book with information about creating a natural home. I would not classify this book as a decorating book, but more a book about creating a life and home filled with natural things (eg: environmentally safe items, etc)."
1,"May smell nice, but impossible to use for serious heat therapy...","This product is essentially some heatable herbal materials very loosely packed into a regular hand towel that is folded in two and sewn together. It has no subsegments sewn into it like similar products on the market to keep the herbal materials inside from accumulating in one place. Unless you plan to use this on a completely flat surface (such as your back while laying down flat on your stomach) the heated herbal material inside always tends to fall under gravity and accumulate in the lower regions of the heat pack, making the distribution of heat extremely uneven. This makes the product impossible to use for serious heat therapy."
1,I must have gotten a Lemon,"First the analog and digital times were almost 30 minutes apart and nothing I could do would synch them up. The chronograpgh function would not work. The date would not show only the incorrect digital time. I tried to find a users manual, as the one in the box did not address the digital side all, but no luck on the Tissot web site.It did look nice though. The clasp was a little loose so I am not sure how well it would stay closed.Going back tomorrow...disappointed."
2,It sucks,"When I got the present I was so excited, but when i looked at it a little more, i noticed that it didnt even have a sharpenor in it!! What kind of present is that?"
4,One of her better books,"While I like Susan Krinard, I'm not one of her most devoted fans. I always find her stories lacking something. However, I think this entry in the series is one of her better ones. While the question of how Tomas never realized that Sim was a werewolf is never answered, Sim is a strong hero, having evolved in Tomas' book from a little more than a bitter bully. Tally is just as flawed in the world's eyes, and their romance is a clarion call for all imperfect people. The secondary romance and all the twists and turns add to the story's interest and complexity. Some things are too clear-cut -- even society's dismissal of Tally -- and some are smoothed over -- like Tally's response to the truth of her brother's betrayal. Such things drop the book under a five-star rating. Nevertheless, the story and the characters keep the reader's attention. This is a good one to read."
1,Defective and Defective Again,"I bought this phone last night. Audio was choppy. Charged the battery overnight. Audio still choppy. Moved base unit. No difference. Replaced cables. No difference. Put my old phone, also a Panasonic gigarange, different model, back on line - to make sure it wasn't a problem with my phone lines. It wasn't. Exchanged the defective telephone for another this morning. The replacement was worse. Sound stutters rapidly making voices unintelligible. Snaps and pops too."
1,not a good choice,"I've had 2 panasonic phones and they were excellent, but this phone was returned in less than 1 week. I went against some of the reviews and decided to try the phone because of my good past experiences with panasonic. I don't know how this phone made it past quality control. The phone would suddenly decided not to ring and then ring on another five minutes later. We missed many calls and I found this to be an unreliable phone."
1,Bad Audio,The phone has very bad audio quality. There is too much cracking. The support just reset the phone using a combination of keys but that did not help.
1,BATTERY LIFE IS NON-EXISTENT,Purschased this joke. The battery runs down after only one hour of continual use! I called Panasonic C/S and they suggested that I box it up and send it back.
5,Outstanding Panasonic 2 line cordless phone!,"I am very surprised to read negative reviews for this phone. I have had it for over a year and have been completely satisfied. Even my elderly parents with poor hearing say they hear me great when I speak on this phone. Just be sure to place it back on the docking station after you complete your calls, so it can recharge. I highly recommend this phone."
1,Don't Buy This Phone,"Panasonic supposedly repaired my phone under warranty. The original wouldn't hold a charge for more than 15 minutes of talk time. I waited 2+ weeks for a replacement and it didn't work. Panasonic customer service was completely unresponsive and rude. I've had great luck with their phones in the past, but despite great features, this one is a lemmon!"
1,Do not buy this phone,"Buy this phone if you want to use the phone for only 2 minutes, because after that the battery discharges."
1,Worked great at first... But then disappointment,"the KX-TG2267B is disappointing how after less than two years it's buttons are now only working intermittently, and I have to order a new phone, as this is out of warranty, and I couldn't get inside to clean the contacts.I've had the other Panasonic model KX-TGA270S base station and handset for just slightly less time than this phone. The KX-TGA270S is a wonderful expandable unit. So I will order anothjer handset for that unit rather than make the mistake of buying this phone again.Anyone remember how phones in the 50s and 60s lasted as long as you used them? Now with these cheap cordless phones we just expect that we have to replace them every few years..."
1,Dreadful battery problem,"It seems that there is a oproblemw ith the Panasonic battery. If you buy a generic one - it works fine. I bought 3 panasonic ones, all just a sbad - dies very suddenly"
1,I Never Received it!,"I am an avid internet user, and ususally shop for discount items online. In this scenario, as of today's date- September 25, 2010, I have still NOT received this item although I have paid for it. I will write to someone to receive a refund and would advise others NOT to purchase from this seller!"
2,Don't waste your money,"Discounting other negative reviews here, I went ahead and purchased this phone several months ago. A pretty little phone it is. And relatively easy to get up and running. BUT unless you a real phone ""techie"" and familiar with multiple menus and cursoring back and forth and up and down, this is not the phone to buy!"
1,highly disappointed,"Since the synopsis (blurb about book) didn't give much indication what was assembled by other volunteers; I had assumed I was reading a nonfiction book about lawyers, not fictional work that is dated back in early 1800s/late 1700s. I stopped at 5% of the eBook version. I was highly disappointed, thank goodness, it was free.Adrienna TurnerAuthor of ""God is in the Equation"""
5,Just because I'm his sister,"doesn't mean that I can't recognize a great book when I see one. Christopher has the ability to bring buildings to ""life."" Andrea Stillman"
5,Women in Prison Triple Pack,Chained Heat is an excellent movie. Red Heat is good and Jungle Warriors I love it. Great movie triple pack!
3,dave's review,"women in prison,chained heat,and red heat are find action films for guys who enjoy watching sexy women wearing skimpy prison garbs,and fighting it out those brutish wardens."
3,Para cuando una edición realmente sin censura de Red Heat???,"Compré este pack porque señalaban que era una versión sin censura de estas películas, grande fué mi decepción cuando en ""Red Heat"" me encuentro que una de las escenas principales del film (la de la violación del personaje de Linda Blair) está prácticamente cortada en su totalidad. Los que vimos esta película en el cine queremos volver a verla sin ningún tipo de censura ya que las escenas que se mostraban comparadas con lo que pasan hoy en día en cualquier canal de televisión no es para nada escandaloso. Ojalá algún día se pueda disfrutar esta película tal como fué filmada ya que considero que son verdaderas películas de culto (en el caso de CHAINED HEAT y RED HEAT) del cine de sexplotaiton de los 80's"
3,Excellent for Linda Blair fans,"The maker of this video combination had a good idea packaging these three ""women in prison"" movies together. I read somewhere that ""Chained Heat"" is considered the masterpiece of this genre. I don't think it compares to the films from the 1970's made in the Philippines with Pam Grier, Sig Haig, Vic Diaz, et. al. But admirers of Linda Blair's physical attributes should love it."
4,Three for the price of one WIPing,If you like Women In Prison flicks ... then these are the top three!For one low price we get lotsa T&A.; Linda Blair's boobs; ya can't go wrong here!Order this to complete your WIPing collection!
1,Cut scenes = WILL NOT BUY,"That's about the long and the short of it... why on earth would I want to spend money to own an edited version of a film? If I want it for my library, I want the original/uncut, DUH... would love to hear the studio address this issue if they're reading the reviews."
1,Poor quality!,"I purchased this mop, like the other reviewer, from Target. I have just used it for the first time and I'm really wishing I'd purchased a more expensive mop! I can't keep the handle screwed on while I'm rinsing off the mop head, nor can I keep the plastic head of the mop, that the sponge is attached to, from scratching my floor while I'm mopping. Like the other reviewer, I found that the ""flip top"" that is used for squeezing is a big pain. This was such a waste of money and I'm not sure that I plan to use it a second time."
2,Flimsy mop,I just bought this mop at Target. I used it on my kitchen floor and immediately regretted buying it. It was less expensive than other sponge mop choices at Target but it is flimsy. The part that squeezes water out of the sponge mop must be unclipped from the mop each squeeze and clicked back into place each time. I tried to use it as little as possible because I think it will break off relatively soon. Pay a little more for a better mop. You will probably be better satisfied and have a mop that will probably last longer.
2,Fairly standard workshop manual.,"This is a fairly standard workshop manual. There are a lot of books available on the e-type, but this one doesn't really add anything new that is not in many of the others, including the factory manual and parts manual."
5,excellent source,"Solid source, compassionate author, interesting case studies, well written material. This book was purchased for work and served it's purpose well."
4,Seriously.,"This CD is pretty out there as far as Reggie and the Full Effect is concerned.The CD proves that Reggie can write songs that have to deal with subjects other than running away. These songs have sincere emotion in them, much unlike anything RATFE has produced before. Caving and Get Well Soon are both excellent examples of this.The CD has it's share of catchy pop tunes as in the other Reggie CD's...however, they are in far fewer quanity on this record.Overall, I trully enjoyed this CD. It's not anything that could win Record of the Year... but it contains some of Reggie's best work. Definity a good buy."
4,"A definite change, but it's still Reggie","This album is a departure in many ways for Reggie, who is no collaborating more with other musicians, and most notably is much angrier than before. More songs on this album show a harder influence, the lyrics and song titles noticably deal with the topic of divorce. Yet there are still songs that have purposefully fake British accents, Klaus from Common Denominator makes an obligatory appearance in a Rammstein mocking song. Like all Reggie albums, this albums shows a range of influences and skips from harder serious material to cheesy synth pop, techno, and back. For the most part, everything is done well."
2,Better off using iTunes,"They have maybe two songs I actually like on here. I would have been better off just going online and buying those two, the rest of the cd stunk."
4,Overall its a pretty good cd,"Let me first start out by saying that this is my first Reggie and the Full Effect cd, so I can't compare this album to their previous ones. The cd contains a nice mix of emo, techno, and metal although I can see where this might lead to some problems with people. I would have prefered more catchy emo tunes like Get Well Soon rather some of the heavier stuff because I have other bands to listen to for that kind of music. You can tell that they are trying to be humorous on a few of the songs and it works well. Overall, this cd has been enjoying listen and I will now look into some of their older material."
3,This cd was okay,"I have never owned a reggie anbd the full effect cd before. I went to see my chemical romance in concert reggie and the full effect opened up for them and they sounded pretty good so I picked up this cd. Let me tell you I think it could have been better. the best songs on the album are take me home please, and get well soon. Those are the only songs that I really like. Hope this helps someone."
4,Cute Movie,This is one of my favorite movies to watch. I like to watch this on a rainy afternoon to get away from things for a while
4,Two for the Price of One,"This 2-disk set comes with two versions of State Fair, 1945 and 1963. Both were entertaining and had great music, but we preferred the 1946 version. Both versions had commentaries and making-of bonus materials. The 1963 remake updates the story with Wayne trying to beat a rival with a race car rather than throwing hoops and sister falling for a TV reporter rather than a print reporter. All together, they were entertaining and it was interesting to see the two versions compared and contrasted."
3,Missing song?,"Fine though this DVD is, I seem to recall a family evening sing-along at the fair in the 1945 film, with a ferriss wheel in the background. The song in question was STRAWBERRY MOON, and I've remembered the melody and lyrics for more than fifty years. Is memory playing tricks with me, and is the song from a similar movie? It sounds pure R&H to me ..."
3,"Wonderful Musical, but.........","As far as the story, cast, and songs go, State Fair is a warm nostalgic film which is highly enjoyable. I bought the DVD for what I hoped would be an improvement over my VHS. I was disappointed by the audio and video quality of the DVD to be quite honest. The audio is so low that I really had to crank up my receiver to get an acceptable volume. Afterall, this is a musical isn't it? In the early part of the film when Jeanne Crain is singing ""It Might As Well Be Spring"", there seemed to be little gnats flying around her face. In reality they were spots on the film that SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP. This condition improved later on, but come on! These Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals should have been given a lot more loving care than they have received. I say this because other musicals in the series also have problems. The audio and video on State Fair needs some restoration, the kind that is afforded other classic films. Otherwise, a worthwhile purchase."
3,Pleasant original R&H film musical,"Rodgers and Hammerstein only contributed six songs to their only original film musical but one of those songs became the Oscar-winning classic, IT MIGHT AS WELL BE SPRING. It is also the only song that grows out of the character and plot. The others are, uncharacteristically for R&H, just songs that could have been written for any film. The story is slight, the direction and performances are plesant, and it adds up to just another competent Fox Technicolor musical. Also nominated for Best Original Score by the Academy. Note: Compare it with the stark and dramatic original 1933 film - the best of all three versions - and the CinemaScope remake of 1962 with Pat Boone and Ann-Margret (a horror). This latter was available on video for about five years, then nose dove into oblivion. It did contain five songs written solely by Richard Rodgers. The Academy was not impressed."
4,State Fair is great!,Every year at State Fair time in Minnesota...we like to watch State Fair on VHS/DVD. Gets us in the mood for the fair.
4,State Fair,"This is one of my faves. Much superior to the re-make with Pat Boone and Ann-Margaret. This is sweet and the stars are just right. Dana Andrews, of ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and ""Laura"" is a jaded reporter covering the Iowa State Fair and is smitten with this young, sweet farmer's daughter and it changes his life. There IS reason for hope. Jeanne Craine plays the young girl and is engaging. She was also in ""Leave Her To Heaven"" and ""Laura"" I believe. Good music with fine vocalists."
3,Not the best Rogers and Hammerstein movie...,"I didnt think that R and H could put out anything bad but in all honesty I wasnt impressed with this movie. I am still banging my head against the wall with the main song ""State Fair"". They sang it so many times in this movie, you cant help but wonder what R and H were thinking... The movie was predictable...Its clean..wholesome...but very very predictable and monotonous.."
1,The DVD Contains NEW Highly Offensive Material,"After BUYING and PAYING for this DVD set I discovered that......When the DVD first starts to play you are FORCED to watch a video describing that it is wrong to copy a movie (Duh). The video depicts various types of theft with nasty heavy metal music. The ability to press the menu button (and have it work) is disabled by the authors of the DVD.This would be no different than if you sat down at a table in a restaurant and the waiter came up and lectured you in harsh terms, about the immorality of skipping out on the check and not paying.These two `State Fair' movies (as well as the original 1933 version) are wonderful entertainment. But the nasty Hollywood video at the beginning completely spoils the mood, and is not appropriate for children (or anyone else with half a brain).Wait for the DVD to be fixed before purchasing."
1,why warner brothers ?,"The looney tunes golden collections were brilliant sets for fans and great value so why with over a thousand cartoons to choose from would warner brothers stop the golden collection and start these superstars series and give us the same cartoons again and not very good quality from what i hear. I was looking forward to many more volumes of the golden collection , very disapointing warner brothers and I wont be buying this set."
3,I Only Recommend The DVD for New Collectors,"I have the majority of the shorts on other Looney Tunes releases, but I made the mistake of buying this DVD thinking that there would be a few never-before-released to DVD. Don't get me wrong, the 15 shorts are great to watch, but I already own them. If you don't own any of the Golden or Spotlight Collection, then this is a great way to start your collection, but if you already own the others then you don't need to buy this DVD.The shorts are:Tweetie PieBad Ol' Putty TatAll A Bir-r-r-dCanary RowPutty Tat TroubleRoom and BirdTweety's S.O.S.Tweet Tweet TweetyGift WrappedAin't She TweetSnow BusinessSatan's Waitin'The Last Hungry CatBirds AnonymousTweety and the Beanstalk"
2,DAKE'S ERRORS,"First of all, Dake believes in a pre-adamic race & what he calls Lucifer's flood. There is no Biblical basis for these teachings & since such a large error is quickly found on the first page, it made me not to want to study this Bible further.I definely do not recomment it to new christians. The notes, which take up much more space than the Word might be confusing to the new student. Old Bible students firmly established in doctrine & the Word might find this Bible useful as a reference tool. Also, some might find the small print hard to read.The most positive thing about this Bible is its size & appearance. I do like the compact size. The durable hardcover is attractive & colorful. I prefer hardcover Bibles not only for their durability, but also for the fact that I consider it sacrilege to cover the Holy Word of God with the skin from a dead (most likely tortured) animal."
2,Do you want to know the name of every player that played for this coach?,I found this book to be a little too detailed. I think coach Woods wants to recognize pretty much every kid that every played for him. He discusses pretty much every game of every season. Mixed in is his coaching philosophy which I did enjoy. I just could have done with a little less detail. Maybe if you were on one of the teams or associated with the school the details would be meaningful to you.
3,Motorhead - Early Years,"I bought this on the assumption it was early concerts. Not the case. The first concert is probably in the 90's as Phil ""filthy animal"" wasn't to be seen. Then the last half of the DVD has a really bad copy of part of Motorheads 10 year birthday party. So if you've never seen that, it's worth a look - only to see robbo and phil lynott from thin lizzy. Other than that, wasn't really impressed with it"
2,If You Even Care.....,"Nobody seems to be visitng this one anyway, but anyway, George Jones didn't release the song written by fellow artist Dickey Lee until 1962 (She Thinks I Still Care). Sammi Smith didn't go to Nashville until 1967 so who did she record this song for? And being alternate takes of the originals. somebody who had the rights to these tunes should be PUNISHED. Stay away."
1,very disappointed,"My 89 year old mother loves Claude King's Wolverton Mountain. Hasspecial memories for her from 1961. So I was pleased to see it here with some other good country hits. I didn't realize I was getting a tape, thought I was getting a CD but that was my fault for not paying attention.What wasn't my fault, however, was I thought I was getting the original recordings but they are all remakes. They're awful. I think they should put that in BOLD LETTERS-REMAKE! Don't waste your money."
3,Um automático básico para natao,Estou no Brasil.Só compro na Amazon e sempre deu tudo certo.A entrega é imediata e sem burocracia.O produto é bom e atende às minhas necessidades.
3,hmmmm,"This is an unauthorized DVD, without any original Cure music. However, if you don't already have Lost in the Labyrinth, it is a good item to add to your collection. If you DO have Lost in the Labyrinth, you DO NOT want this as it is the exact same item under a different title/cover art. Long Live the Cure!"
4,Quirky but fun,"I think this will be the start of big things for Devotchka. They have a somewhat different sound, compared to a lot of the bands out there, but it never fails to please the ear, and get your toes tapping."
3,A cute dollhouse patio set with a few issues,"Plan Toys normally exceeds my expectations when it comes to craftsmanship and durability but with this set there were just a couple of issues for my 3 year old. When setting up the folding chair it was just beyond her abilities to set a rail into a corresponding notch each time. It required her to hold and slide pieces at the same time and it collapses again whenever you move the chair. The regular chairs are cute but the fabric backs slide off if you try to pick them up and move them. And the umbrella requires the extending ribs to be twisted on elastic bands in just the right direction for the umbrella to open correctly. Again, all beyond her abilities and kind of annoying when I have to stop what I am doing to set this up for her."
3,Power Playback - Pink Ranger Adventure,"The second in the Power Playback video series, Pink Ranger Adventure gives us a look at two early episodes of the Power Rangers series, which is currently in its eighth year. This video shows us the episodes ""Calamity Kimberly"" from the show's first season, and ""Beauty and the Beast"" from the show's second season. Both episodes are done exellently however with only two episodes on the one video, many customers may get bored with it quickly. I reccomend other full length Power Rangers videos such as the new Power Rangers Lost Galaxy video movie. However, the included episodes in the ""Pink Ranger Adventure"" showcase just how good MMPR was back in 1993 and could be enjoyable for long time fans of the series."
5,"Great ""big picture"" reading for all ages","This is about so much more than Custer and The Battle: how Native American names evolved, character and personalities on both sides, lives before and after the big event, which eventually culiminated at Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (Dee Brown.) There is plenty of humor and irony and ego, as well as sadness and regret. It led me to read more on the Plains tribes and also to the books: In the Spirit of Crazy Horse (Peter Matthiessen) and Crazy Horse and Custer-The Parallel Lives of Two American Warriors ( Stephen Ambrose.) My copy now has sticky notes and highlighted para., notes and references--book held together w/ a rubber band."
5,Surprisingly awesome!,"I picked this up at the library one day because it had songs on it, having no idea if my Barney-addicted 3 year old would like it. She watched it over and over and over again. She cried when we had to return it to the library a week later, and we haven't seen it in since. I have been looking all over for more Wee Sing videos, and I am so happy to find them! If your child likes the Wee Sing audio tapes (my daughter cannot ride in the car without them), then she'll love this video!"
2,Interlaken,Mostly showed hang gliders over and over. Does not show much of the area around Interlaken. I was dissatisfied with the content.
1,Disappointed,"I bought the Invitation to Worship DVD and I must say that I'm diappointed to say the least. Here's why:1. The audio quaility of the DVD is extremely poor. On some songs I can hardly hear Bryon singing.2. The DVD plays like a VHS - you cannot skip through the DVD which is very frustrating. You have to hold the FF and hope you don't go pass the next song.3. The audio seems to go from stereo to mono to just plain horrible at some points.4. It was a very poor mixing job both video and audio. The transitions between songs leave you wondering what's going on.5. The Presence of the Lord DVD is soooooo much better.Unless you are a diehard fan, buy something else. I recommend Tri-City's - Blessing of Abraham. Excellent DVD all-around. There is no comparison. I like Bryon Cage's music, but I thought the DVD was lacking a bit."
1,Extremely disappointed,I was very much looking forward to this DVD as I love Byron's other music. But this left very much to be desired. It looked like an independent artist put this together. Byrons lips were moving and nothing was heard...or what was heard wasn't what he was saying by watching his lips. The transitions were very choppy and there was no smooth transitions. I got tired of hearing the same canned applause when you saw no one in the crowd moving. I would not recommend the DVD to anyone. Just be happy with the CD and save yourself the disaapointment.
2,Frustrating book,As another reviewer has noted this is a frustrating book to beging PS 6 with. Rather than taking you one step at a time the authors throw so much information at the reader that you get bogged down with so many details some of which are very poorly explained. This is definately not a book for beginners. Very poor learning design as I have found out with other so called Quick Start titles. A waste of money actually.
2,Don't Start Here,"As a technical writer who is new to Photoshop but generally experienced with software documentation, I was very disappointed in this book. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is more of a reference guide than a ""QuickStart Guide"" (which implies that it is for beginners). There are almost no explanations of how the various features and controls work together, nor why you would want to use one over another. If I was an experienced user looking for information on a specific item, I could hardly do better. As a new user looking for an introduction, I could hardly do worse!"
2,"Not For Beginners; Black&White, Crowded Format a Problem Too","So far this is the Photoshop book I'd tell you to buy last after my buying 5 different ones. It is the one in use in my college level course and I think they should use just about anything else. Its biggest problem is that it is just too complicated for a beginner to use. It throws an enormous amount of material before you.(That is the effect it has upon you as a student--data being dumped on you en masse) Hours later into reading it, you are no better off than when you started. It is also in black and white and every single page is jam packed with material. This off-putting visual style/format is no aid to learning either. Now that I'm steadily improving in Photoshop, I hope I am able to occasionally open this book and learn something I haven't gleaned elsewhere so as to get my [money] out of it. I have yet to be able to do this though. I can't really recommend buying this book and I think colleges should stop requiring it as the text."
4,Vornado Products,"I've always loved Vornado fans. I have several and have given them as gifts. They are efficient and quiet and used to be made in the U.S., but I see this one was not."
5,Vornado 530L Fan,"I have owned a large Vornado fan for 20 years (it runs constantly much of the winter, circulating the heat from our wood burning stove). So when I needed a small fan for my office, I purchased the 530L. It's light, easy to move, quiet (on the slow speed, which Is all I need), sturdy, and effective. IMHO, no other brand comes close."
3,Motor Noise....Ah,"Fan moves air and the blade sound is fine. But, there's a humming or some type of sound that comes from the base that's loud. Has to be put in the farthest part of the room, near the closet to muffle that noise. Strange--why does the quality in so many products keep going down, while the prices keep going up?"
2,"Starts off great, then the blades start getting stuck","I've had this and other Vornado fans of the same size, and they have all stopped working due to the fan blades getting more and more stuck over time. Whether you clean the blades or not, within 6-12 months, the blades get slower and slower until it barely produces any wind at all. Cleaning the fans repeatedly did not stop this process, and no other of my fans have done this."
4,not white,I love vornado fans I think they are the best quality.I did find out that linen white is NOT WHITE it is off white.
1,Quality Problem!,"I own one of the larger Vornado fans and have had it for many years without problems. My mother has two of the larger Vornado fans that she has also had many years with no issues. This smaller version, the Vornado CR1-0073-25 530 Air Circulator(Made in China) apparently does not have the same quality of other models. I have had it less than two years, and only use it seasonally, and it just quit working this morning. Very disappointed as these are not inexpensive fans."
1,Abnormally Small Hat,"This hat would not fit any normal sized adult head. It looks nice but is so shallow it would never work. Also the company has a horrible return policy. In order to return the product one must email the seller in order to get a ""return approval"" then if you get the approval you must return product within 15 days which is not a very reasonable timeframe when purchasing gifts for Christmas."
2,Small Hat,This hat fits poorly on most people because it is so shallow. Consider you head size carefully before purchase.
5,Great gift book,"Huzzah, asinine! These are very very funny love poems. Some are silly, some are naughty, some are actually poignant and romantic. But I got a chuckle out of all of them, and a good laugh out of quite a few. This is fun gift book for poetry lovers who need a break from the usual verse out there, which is often so self-consciously serious. And it's also a great gift book (and bathroom read) for people who hate poetry or find it impenetrable because this stuff is very accessible."
5,Great product at a great price!,Kelp is very well balanced form of iodine. It has been shown in research that different forms of iodine have different effects on the thyroid. Kelp has a balance of all sources. This product has a large quantity of kelp tablets that are easy to swallow and contain a very reasonable does.
3,You can find better transmitters,"The quality of the sound is acceptable, when you get your radio to tune in the transmitter: you need, usually to put it very close to the radio in order to hear the music, even on places where there are no radio signals.A great turn off is the need to use batteries instead of using the car power sources."
1,Poor Quality...Don't buy it,"This thing never worked properly, its got to be really close to the radio if you want it to work. If by any chance you want this for your car, don't waste your money it sucks."
3,Good but not great,"I like it for the most part but the thing with it is that it goes thru batteries like water. 1 set of batteries may last a few days and as it is sucking power the reception to whatever radio you use gets weak. Also, I found out that while using the transmitter, your player has to be turned down or else it will overdrive the transmitter and the sound will be poor. You pretty much have to search for the balance between your transmitter and radio in order to get quality sound between the them."
1,Poor Quality - Don't Buy It,"Audio Performance was considerably worse than AM radio, sound is muffled and full of static even though the unit features PLL (phased lock loop) tuning to the preset fequencies."
3,AAA batteries?,I just received this item in the mail. I chose it specifically because everything said it took AA batteries. But now it says on the back of the package that it takes 2 AAA batteries. Disappointed and Confused.
1,Unit came with two major problems....,"The unit came with a speaker buzz and a repetitive tick whenplaying CDs, mainly because of manfacturing and designshortcuts.On opening the unit I found two unshielded flat ribbon cablesfolding and tucking these between the circuit boards fixedthe buzz, adjusting the CD's sled trim pot fixed theCD player's (focus?) tick. By the way these things are throwntogether, I sure many other units would have these samebasic problems. After ""repairing"" then CDs sound finethrough headphones.The FM radio has a poor signal to noise ratio and soundsalso sounds ""thin"" though the speakers.I only ""repaired"" my new unit only because my kids likethe looks, other people would just ask for a refund.."
1,Looks neat...,"...but that's about it. The radio hardly receives anything, only about 3 FM stations come in. I know it's this radio that has the problem, since my coworkers can get stations I can't even find on this thing's dial. Since I bought it so I could listen to the radio at work, I'm returning it.I never tried the CD player, so I can't say how that works. It didn't come with an instruction manual or anything at all in the box except for the radio itself - not that I needed a manual, it's a radio/CD player, it's not that hard to figure out, but it shows you the kind of quality product you're dealing with here. Oh, and it does take 6 C batteries instead of the power cord, but because of the way the cord has to plug in inside the battery compartment, you can't have batteries in it in case the power goes out.I guess that's what you get when you don't buy a big name brand. I won't be making that mistake again. I am VERY unhappy with this radio."
4,Futuristic looking gadget works well for me,"I don't know what problems others are having with their radio-CD player but mine works great. I specifically asked for one of these at Christmas to use in the office, where I listen to classical music on streaming audio from my local NPR station.The radio sounds as good as the signal I got from streaming audio and the CD player worked fine this morning when I played a new version of Mahler's Symphony No. 1 at work. It has plenty of volume for an office product and holds the FM signal from my radio station much better than past radios I tried to use in the office.In addition, I'm happy to say the players plays all my homemade CDs even though the instructions specifically state that it will only play CDs that have the CD label impressed on them.All told, I report much happiness with my machine, at least in the first few weeks I've used it. The radio is terrific and the CD players works fine."
4,Very Useful Tool...Not Over Done,"This is a great tool to organize yourself. Easy to use. The basics but it has all of the essentials for someone who wants an entry level PDA. It is not the ""sturdiest"" made product. It is definitely not made to last years and years....it only comes with a 90 DAY warranty. When purchasing this PDA (it is worth it if you don't want something too complicated) and are offered the extended warranty (I bought mine at Best Buy) buy it...for $30 or so you get 2 Years instead of the manufacturer's 90 DAY."
5,I love this Palm!,"I bought this Palm based on the recommendation of two colleagues who really liked theirs. They weren't kidding! This little guy is easy to operate, very reliable, easy to synch, light and cute. No need for a lot of bells and whistles. It's just great!"
2,Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue - Titanium Ranger,This show has got to be the greatest power rangers I ever seen when I have seen this show everyday on Saturday morning. And I would like to say to the parents that when our children they wanted to watch power rangers show all the time when they to watch it so much. This show will effect our children doing wrong things at school by using martial art with their friends and their family at their homes we should not let our children watching it. Only when I watch it this show will not effect me in no where and I don't know how to martial art yet and I will not using it on poeple that what I could to.
1,What a pile,"This CD gets a very generous rating of 1 star because the mixing wasn't as terrible as the track selection was. Having said that, it is typical Ferry Corsten, and by that measure, it's probably one of his better CDs, but it really is a shame his apparent skills are being wasted on music that makes you believe the moon, the earth, and your car, among other things, are made out of cheese.There are one or two tracks that helped me stop screaming bloody murder, but in any event if you like the ""cheesy"" side of trance, you'd probably love this CD. It's just not my cup of tea, so I had to do the double eject (eject from car CD player, eject out of car window onto 605 Freeway) on this one."
4,"All Aboard,Ferry Corsten","This one is not quite as good as the sequel,Ibiza but like any Ferry mix,it's mixed well and flows good.This album has a few more trance anthems than the second one.It seems as if ""the sound of goodbye"" is on every trance cd nowadays.There is also one track,""needlejuice""I believe it's called that drags,and basically leads to nothing.My favorite track on here has to be ""im in love"",it has a bad ass beat to it.Furthermore,if your a dance fan you will get this cd."
4,Ferry is brilliant,"The only reason I have rated this a 4 is because I have heard nearly all of the tracks on Trance Nation 2001 (import), which Ferry himself mixed. The selection of tracks is astounding, and the mix really brings brings the energy at the end. I do like Ferry's other cd's like Solar Serenades better. This cd seems a little to Americanized, a little toned down and mainstream to hit a larger audience in America. The tracks are more common than his other mixes, but it's still an outstanding mix."
4,A Must For Fans!,"This video is actually made from an episode of Spiderman that aired on television. I purchased it for my four and a half year old son who adores Spiderman. He also has the VHS tape of the origin of Spiderman (made in the 60's). He likes this episode better though, because of the story involving Hobgoblin and Kingpin. It certainly shows how far our animation has come in 30 years. The look is definitely updated for the 90's; Peter Parker no longer wears glasses, and looks more well built than he did in years past. Still he carries the angst of not being able to do the right thing which is what always made Spiderman different from other superheroes (as is evidenced by how the doctor and Mary Jane feel about his treatment of Aunt Mae).This is definitely not the ""Ultimate Spiderman"" (Spiderman trapped in a different universe) for which I am grateful. Thank you Marvel, I hope you put out more episodes, so we can collect them all."
4,Great gift for kids,I bought this VHS for my younger brother. I opted for the VHS because he has a horrible habit of not putting movies up in their case. This movie has been watched many times by him and still works great.
1,Hogwash,"I believe that's what folks back in the midwest would have called it - and I would have to agree. Self-absorbed, pseudo-intellectual, completely disconnected from anything remotely resembling academic or empirical work - in any discipline. I find it interesting that some of the reviewers who gave this book high praise included spelling errors in their reviews. This strikes me as incongruous with the type of mind that would be required to actually comprehend some of the sentences and turns of phrase that Mr. De Landa includes in this magnum opus of florid tripe."
4,De Landa is my instructor now.,"WELL, this guy is just as intertaining in his lectures as he is in his book. While the class is billed as a graduate architecture history course, it really is more like a philosophy class. His points are well contrived and straight foward, but I haven't quite swallowed the hook whole yet.The book itself however is quite good. All one needs is an open and receptive mind that is able to free itself from any preconceived notions and generalities that we often catagorize life into. i.e. ""The Market"" ""Captialism"" ""The People""-words we use for a non-specific ambiguious thoughts"
5,My kids love this video and they're not easy to please!,This video is great for home schooling as well as just providing good clean fun for kids! Lots of interesting things about ships and how things get moved around the docks. I highly recommend it.
3,some fun for small boys,"I bought this for a fourth birthday gift for a boy I seldom see. His grandmother says he loved it, but the overall quality was very cheap. She's hoping it will hold up until Hallowe'en. Good for a while, but apparently not worth the money."
3,Brian Boitano & Friends (Figure Skating Superstarts),"I enjoyed the DVD. I would probably rate it as 3 1/2 stars. It has some really good skaters and competitions in it. I've never been much of a Tonya Harding fan since her competition so I could have done without her in it. I like competitions, but I like the more laid back shows better, like Stars on Ice and special evenings with the skaters, so that is why I rated this the way I did. I would still recommend it to others to add to their collection."
3,I must be missing something,"Maybe it's because I was born in the 80's and not partying then, or maybe I'm just too middle-class, but I thought this entire book was pretty mediocre. The characters were interesting, but usually I felt like the author was trying too hard to make them interesting. Janowitz fits in with the Bret Easton Ellis/Jay McInerney style of writing about what it's like to be incredibly spoiled and have no soul. The two aforementioned authors pull that off with a lot more style and ability than she does.I only read this book because I heard that the character of Stash is in Ellis' book American Psycho. Overall, I found myself interested in the stories and the characters, but most of the stories lacked a certain human aspect that the other two authors know how to provide. This is a good read if you're stuck in an airport all day with nothing else, otherwise I'd recommend getting something with more substance."
3,Amusing read,"This was the first book I read by Ms. Janowitz and the story, for the most part, moves along at a nice pace. There are the various assortment of characters...some making numerous appearances, some only a solo appearance. I did appreciate her witty sense of humour."
3,Capitalism to the Rescue!,"This is a well intentioned and very well thought out and developed idea about finding a way to compensate Native cultures for being successful ""stewards"" of biodiversity. I give it three stars primarily for its footnotes and bibliography so anyone interested in preserving Native cultural diversity yet also interested in accepting and maintaining the power of a global market economy can find further resources. The author excels at the use of the third person passive voice and analyitical reasoning; he obviously knows a lot about biological resources of plants. To some this book will be a hope for justice to Native people, to others it will be literally a ""sell out"". Good luck deciding which one you will be when YOU finish reading it!"
5,Easy to Read & I Love the Mix,"This is such a Beautiful Bible and is so easy to read. I've tried reading other ""one year bibles"" and have never been able to make my way through it in it's entierty but this one is incredible."
4,Books and chapters can be hard to find,"This Bible is written in plain and simple English, so it's easy to study and understand. You read a portion from the Old Testament, the New Testament, Psalms and Proverbs.The only problem I have with it is that everything blends together. The books aren't at the top of the pages and the chapter numbers are in very small bold print, which can be hard to see. I also think it would've been nice to have Jesus' words in red and also the words of God in purple or something. I like the way it's set up though, with the options of one- and two-year reading plans."
1,This Seiko watch didn't work.,"Bought this watch for a Christmas gift...it didn't work. Directions said that sometimes quartz watches just needed new battery so had a new battery put in...watch still didn't work. Sent it back and ask for replacement that will work...haven't heard back from Amazon yet. If I get one that works,I'll upgrade this rating."
3,Pretty Good,"Having recently aquired this one, I haven't listened to it more than ten times or so. Things that have struck me so far:1. I much prefer Eric Matthews' ""Lateness of the Hour"" over this.2. It definitly has it's moments, especially the tunes where E. Matthews had a hand in the writing.I had high hopes...perhaps too high, but if you've gotten this far, I'd recommend you give it a listen. For this genre, it's pretty good. Considering what passes for music nowadays, it's very good. I'd give it a strong 3.5 stars if I could."
2,Paranormal,"I found this a struggle to finish. Mariana Morgan is a psychic healer, albeit a fairly new psychic. She's only recently discovered her skills and is trying to develop them by starting her life over. There are, apparently, previous books in the series, but I didn't realize this right away, and it definitely made this story a lot more difficult to understand without the previous information from those stories. Mariana has a negative reading with Umberto Marconi, only to find him dead on the doorstep of the shop where she works after they close up shop, a shop which houses several different alternate healers. LAPD detective David Claybourne keeps an open mind, at least enough to inquire with the alternate healers as to any knowledge they might have in regards to Marconi. He keeps his eye on Mariana, as well. I didn't particularly care for the characters or the writing, but it could be that I didn't like jumping into a series mid-stream."
3,Sour Junglist,"well well well, a jungle dj with a good mix that is NOT from europe? Cool, but freaky flow has been good before. Not many dj's can melody scratch, but it seems like freaky flow does it with ease. It's really well mixed, and the MC is pretty good. I don't think it's his best cd, mainly cuz i didnt like the track selection and i was more impressed with his melody scratching over Gasmask(Virus). Best track on the cd though would be track 12, GFS Feat. J. Smooth - ...Ain't Easy. i mean, its not casino royale, but i wouldnt think that a non-european POPULAR dj on Moonshine would play a track like that. PLUR"
3,"hmmmm, i dunno bout this one...","ok, freaky flow is one of the best when it comes to the skills of spinnin, especially his crazy melody scratchin(or whatever its called), but this cd really bored me. don't get me wrong, this is a good cd. there just weren't any great parts to it. no ""climax"" to the cd...you know, theose parts of the cd when yer drivin down the road, and the dj starts mixin in the next track, and you just want to pull over, jump outta yer car and start dancin'? well, this cd just didn't do it for me. i bought danny the wildchild's cd the same time i bought this one, and i would say that i listen to danny's cd about 95% of the time, in comparison to freaky flows,,,ehhh, if you already have danny's cd, then i guess you should buy this one."
2,you have got to be kidding....,"dullsville...if you want the dope scratching and sick tracks, get a RAW cd, or some old hype....this guy is seriously over-rated...and as far as his claims at being the first to combine hip-hop and jungle, please..."
2,maybe you'd like it.... i don't,"Freaky flow is very ""popish."" He plays ""anthems"" or ""anthem type"" tracks that's about it. His scratching is ok nothing special, especially when set beside other djs known for it. All in all take it for what it is a mediocre local dj trying to go world wide."
4,a great resource,"As a Bible college graduate and youth pastor, I could not do without this commentary set. Wiersbe uses everday illustrations and gives a good explanation of the text. However as with many commentators, some difficult passages are skipped. I think the new testament series is just a step above these."
2,Clumsy at best,"I had a 3 blade Schick, which I tested against my 2 blade razor when it came out. So naturally when it became difficult to find blades, I upgraded to the 4 blade. Big mistake, this is a bad razor. The handle is thick and clunky, difficult to hold in the shower. And the blade face is like dragging a board across your face.Well, at least it shaves better, right? Not that I can tell, in fact when I was done I had to clean up with my 3 blade! Junk, I loaded up on 3 blade cartridges and hopefully by the time I run out there will be something else better. This ain't it."
4,great book,I actually got this book for my sister as a birthday gift and she loved it. very interesting and great pics.
4,Awesome,"This book is the best chronicling of these early century occult meetings I have come across, it is a must have for anyone interested in the spirit of the humanity's need for telling ghost stories and really living their lives in a way to make people believe. I am not one who believes any of this is really genuine, but I feel they make for very interesting folk tales, awesome."
3,big bad beats,"This CD is a good combo of old school mix takes and 90's big beat drum beats. If you like the ""THE FREESTYLERS"" then this right up the same alley. British DJ's with a flavor for old school rap and the brit club scene. This a harder edged sound that the trance/electronic genre and mixes in many carribean influences."
1,Utter kack!,TThis is the worst pile of teen arse I've ever heard in my entire life! Although I do know a chap called Ian who thought it was the best album in the world... EVER!
4,not bad not really good,well i gave 4 stars because of 4 good songs on this lp.i think bomfunk did a good job and a cd full of variety.just can recommend u to buy it...
5,"The other music fan has it right, not ozzy","It's a great cd with good, yet repetive, electra/rap songs with some guitar. The real seller is the music videos of freestyler and b-boys,fly-girls, included on the cd. They are worth the import price alone. Both videos are origanal, funny and entertaining. You also get a glimpse of life in Helsinki, where the Bomfunk mcs are from and where the videos were shot. Too bad it's not marketed in the U.S., but I bet that it wouldn't have an impact as large as it did in Europe. Too bad. It's still a great cd, though. Just make sure you get the cd with the bonus videos."
2,Bomfunks are finnish!,"i just wanted to tell that they aren't polish, but finnish, i should know since i am a pure blood finn myself!!!about the music itself.. this isn't really my type of music, but it's nice that a finnish band has success abroad too!"
1,Very Poor,I ordered the cd twice and both times it was unplayable on CD player and on itunes. Finally gave up. Really wanted to hear this album as it is highly regarded by many.
1,When they say custom fit it means they walked past the car and eyeballed the size,"Doesn't come close to fitting. It is inches off and cut poorly. Hangs down 10 inches on each side because it was so poorly made. Look elsewhere, this one is going back. It doesn't even deserve the single star I had to put."
3,A gift,This was a gift for my 10yr old daughter. She loves Monster High and was very excited to receive this.
4,My 6 year old loves it!,"She has watched it as much as will allow, and has not grown tired of it yet. great gift for 6 year old."
4,Okay quality,"My six year old daughter loves the story. But, I was disappointed in the quality of the playback. We bought the digital version."
4,Monster High: My daughter loves the movie,My daughter begged to watch the movie while going to sleep. Loved it and can't wait to invite her fellow Ghoul lover over for a night of Monster High doll playing and movie watching.
5,Bday gift,My daughter watched it every day for about a good 2 weeks. We didn't mind as she was never a movie watcher but since she got the dolls from family & friends she plays with them while watching the movies.
5,Very happy,Was shipped. On time packaged. Well and my girls just love it. Can't. Wait for the others to come out
5,Daughter loved it,I have not seen this but my 8yr old daughter loved it so much that she wanted the Monster High high school play set and dolls for Christmas.
5,Wish we had these characters 35 yrs ago!,"Monster High is actually a well done enterprise. The dolls are cute, the movies have morals to learn from and if you love monsters like I have for 40 years you get something fun out of it. Maybe I'm immature but I just love the concept, Matel has really succeeded in this endeavor!"
5,very good,"This is just what my little one needed, great little movie for her and friends, goes along well with her monster high school and dolls."
4,Cute Monster High Adventure,"I am an adult Monster High collector and fan of the webisodes, so I was very excited to add a dvd of the ghouls to my collection!The movie is cute with a simple storyline that kids will enjoy. A fictional history of Halloween is used as a means to get the plot going. All of the characters were true-to-character, and the movie did a good job of highlighting as many Monster High ghouls as possible.I was disappointed that there were no well-known recorded songs in the movie. Even in dance scenes, what amounts to elevator music was played. Familiar songs would have added to the Halloween theme of the movie.The three shorts included on this dvd are funny, and are done in the same style as the webisodes.I wish the movie had more of a Halloween ""feel"" to it, but I'm happy with the cute story it is. Overall, if you are a Monster High fan, I think you will enjoy this movie for all of the familiar faces we have grown to love."
5,Good halloween family movie,Good movie to watch with your kids on Halloween. Male characters in movie can appeal to boy viewers. Not just a kid girl movie. Good animation.
1,Does not work,Ordered this DVD for Christmas present and the DVD does not play at all. Scratchy picture. My daughter was very disappointed
3,Cute movie,This is a cute movie with a good message. I watched it instantly on my kindle Fire and it work great.
5,ITS REALLY NICE,MY GRANDDAUGTHER LOVE THESE DOLLS SHE CANT STOP PLAYING WITH THEM SHE WAS DRESSED UP LIKE THE DOLLS FOR FREIHT NIGHT AT HER SCHOOL.
5,Monster High is a hit,"Ghouls Rule is a movie our Granddaughter really wanted to see, as she has been collecting the toy dolls and wanted to see them in action,and she wasn't disappointed, really glad we rented this through Amazon instant videos because as grandparentswe enjoyed watching it with her, really well made and kinda funny in a goofy way. To see our granddaughter smiling and laughing throughout I'd say this movie is a hit."
4,My girls loved it....,"Haven't watched it myself, but my 6 year old is a big Monster High fan and LOVED it... the 3 year old did, too - but that pretty much could be said for anything her big sister likes!"
3,"Cute and fun, but a little rushed","I love MH and I've seen all of the T.V. specials they've aired in the past. I was super excited for a DVD release, but this isn't one of their better movies. It is super rushed and they tried to squeeze in too many side stories. It felt a little shallow and its a forgettable movie. The earlier movies were better such as Fright On!That being said, it was still fun and I enjoyed watching it."
3,...But the Bonus Footage Does Not,"This is a good price here at Amazon for this movie. We paid almost the same at Target when it was on sale there. This movie can be found in the DVD section- not in the doll section. All the dolls are sold separately. My daughter requested only a few definite gifts for Xmas, and this was one of them. Otherwise, I would never have bought this. I figure that you can just wait for someone to post it on youtube or for Mattel to even put it out on the MH website. The movie is a little over an hour, and is tolerable adult-wise. It is the bonus footage that stinks. It has three shorts which are two minutes in length each. Yes, you did not read wrong, folks- two minutes. If you wanna be positive, we can do the math and get to a grand total of six minutes. Mattel, people love bonuses in any form. Hook us up next time."
3,"The movie is good, But not that good","the animation is very nice, the music and the design are just perfect, but the problems are on the scrypt and dialogues, always an easy and short way to solve the plots, the story is too compressed that characters and conflicts happens in a fast and superficial way, the jokes are soft and without originality, the scrypt looks like made it by student or inexperienced people. the main story idea is very good, but the movie looks like made it with no big film ambitions.of course this perspective is just mine (and adult guy dolls collector) but making a comparison; My Little Pony ""friendship is magic"" episodes are WAY better, more much fun and original than monster high specials including ""ghouls rule"" :("
5,Great Movie,My 6 yr old Granddaughter wanted it for Christmas because we rented it--she loves it!! Cute movie for little girls!!
4,Beautiful Illustrations!,"The text in Ragged Bear is short and simple. It is about an old bear who is played with, but is not the favorite toy. Then, being left at the park one day gives him a new lease on life with someone who rightfully gives him the same kind of love that he had always given to others. This sweet story is accompanied by beautiful watercolor illustrations that bring out the most sensitive qualities of this book. The artwork alone is worth purchasing this book if you are a teddy bear lover who appreciates fine illustrations of teddy bears, but it is also an appropriate story for the youngest teddy bear lovers."
4,"Good, Not Great","A must have for any fan of Dylan's, poetry, or just plain ole life. The artists have interpreted and presented individually, and that's what makes this CD good. The halting, ""I Want You,"" alone is worth the price of admission to this uneven, earthy experience. I like the CD so well, I gave a musician/friend/artist my first copy before I purchased my second."
2,Nodding-out to Bob,"Nodding-out to Bob: most of these songs have been sapped, in these performances, of any humor, sarcasm or exhilaration they once had."
5,Quality covers of eclectic mic of Dylan songs,"This amazing album ranges from a soulful Guy Davis growling his way through ""Sweetheart Like You"" to the eerie harmony of the Roche Sisters as little girls dealing with Daddy's illerate badgering, mom's pragmatic family control, and startling news in ""Clothesline Saga."" All Along the Watchtower's gorgeous bluegrass fiddle (the Paperboys) and the haunting rhythms of Marttin Simpson's Boots of Spanish Leather are covers I come back to over the years. For those who like to hear what Dylan's lyrics would have sounded like had he stayed ""mainstream,"" Delia is a surprising treat.A Nod to Bob: An Artists' Tribute to Bob Dylan on His Sixtieth Birthday"
2,"""Nodding off"" is more like it","Producing a tribute to Bob Dylan by having other singers cover his songs is almost as ludicrous as asking a bunch of painters to re-do Monet's water lilies. These are cheap imitations. Only ""Restless Farewell"" (Norman Blake & Peter Ostroushko) has anything to recommend it.The remainder, despite the high profile and great work of some of the other performers, is pretty bleak. In particular, Lucy Kaplanskys' rendition of ""It Aint Me Babe"" will make your skin crawl. There is a lot of sappy sentimentalism here that bears no resemblance to the grit, irony, and sometimes venom in Dylan's delivery. If you are a Dylan fan, don't waste your money on this. If you have money to burn, give it to charity."
2,pretty ordinary,"You won't go around humming any of these, although the Rambling Jack cuts are pretty good"
3,Very uneven,"Martin Simpson, The Roches, Guy Davis, Norman Blake, and The Paperboys deliver some very strong interpretations. Simpson is especially good on ""Spanish Boots"". Rosalie Sorrels and Spider John turn in some solid work also. Balancing these are the ""sensitive folkies"" who deliver some miserable performances. Cliff Eberhardt is especially wretched with a dirge like tempo that goes nowhere. ....but in the end there is Jack Elliot. In the end there will always be Jack Elliot and he finishes up on an upbeat note for what is overall a spotty but worthwhile disc."
1,DO NOT BUY A NWB PHONE,"After having my old phone for 40 years I purchased another model NWB phone and it lasted 5 months. You cannot get through on their help line and they do not answer their e-mail, Buy a NWB phone at your own risk."
4,Multi-Pack - how many is that??,"Unless I'm missing something, I don't see how many of these mice you get in the ""multi-pack"". After a Google search, looks to be ""5"". This is a pretty glaring omission,IMO.Haven't used this product yet, after picking a couple of these up locally on sale for around $13 ea., but generally speaking, MS produces pretty good quality components, so I expect this product to work well.Hope this helps."
4,Simple the best.,The story of the best player un the history of the game.I would have like to see another game then his first and a litle more about his return in 1996.But this is great.
3,"Magic is Magic, but DVD is not","This DVD follows the career of the great Magic Johnson. There are highlights, lowlights, college and NBA battles and championship rings. This is one of the NBA greats at his best. In similar format to Sir Charles and Hakeem the Dream and in similar length, the DVD offers good value, but is a little short in length.It would have been great to have an additional DVD like Larry Bird's or Ultimate Michael with actual games of the great man, not just highlights. While a good addition, not essential."
1,Not worth it,Price is nice but the product is not. Installed it and the chord it came with did not make connection with the pins at all. Not only was the chord junk but it started leaking drips of coolant throughout the element seals not where it goes into the block but where the chord connects too so now I had a bad chord and coolant entering the electrical side of the component and even heard a small arc/pop inside the chord when I tried to plug it in one last time. Returned it and requested a refund too much mess to deal with a sub par component that didn't even work by the end of the first week
1,DONT BUY IT,Wen I got this product I use a cotton cloth and ise it 100 times I Do not even have that many scratches on my screen. DONT BUY THIS. Its a wast of moneyp
1,"HORRIBLE DON""T BUY!!!!!",This product is terrible! It broke my iphone now it doesn't turn on or charge!!! I have to get a new iphone because I used this product. Do not buy it! It didn't even fix the scratches. I'm so furious that it shorted out my iphone or did something to it because now it doesn't work!!!!!
2,Did not remove scratches!,I tried this product out on a 2nd gen ipod nano and on my powerbook G4. All it did was give the items a good cleaning. I didn't notice any significant removal of scratches. I would not reccomend this product for scratch removal.
3,It works for some...,"I had very minor scratches on my sunglasses so I used this and it took the scratches off completely, but I used it on my phone that had minor scratches also and they haven't come off yet. And I've been buffing for 2 hours to get them off, but haven't succeeded. So in my opinion, it works for some and doesn't. I will keep trying though."
1,Don't waste your money,This product didn't do a thing for even the smallest scratch. I followed the directions and rubbed with drops for hours with no good results. I ended up going to Best Buy and getting zagg HD invisible shield which works great AND hides the scratch.
1,iDrops doesn't work,"Hi There, I'm a skeptic but I tried the iDrops, they didn't work... basically I asked support and they were very helpful however all it does is clean the plastic it doesn't remove scratches very well. I used a 100% cotton cloth as recommended, it simply ended up putting more scratches on the screen. Don't bother, buy Novus Plastic Polish Kit, it works wonders and is much better. If you don't believe this review type iDrops MacWorld Review, they found the same thing. Don't waste your money this product is useless."
1,Horrid,Waste of money. Tried for 30 minutes and no results. Will never buy again. Does not even work on minor scratches!
1,It just doesn't work,"after hours of scrubbing... I mean hours. I used up the whole bottle. It didn't do a thing even with the small scratches on my ipad screen. Nothing, nada, nope. I can deal with loosing the $15.00 for the iDrops. Its the time I spent scrubbing that I will never get back that bugs me. I think the bannana peal did more. Save your money!"
5,Amazing product.,"This was the first, and only ipod scratch remover that I purchased. After reading reviews, I didn't see a reason not to try it out, especially given the state of my ipod. It did take a while to completely remove the scratches (they were more like layered, deep scuffs). It took about an hour to get the majority of the scratches out, but it was definitely worth it. Make sure to use a soft cotton cloth, I did accidentally put some tiny scratches back into it by using (what I thought was) a soft old tee shirt."
1,Made no difference for me,"I read a lot of positive reviews about this, but it did nothing for my scratched iPad 2. I spent a lot of time working on the scratches, as recommended, but it made no difference; in fact, it actually seemed to make it look worse. I ended up putting Ghost Armor on the front to hide the scratches and prevent new ones."
2,It's ok,Works on light scratches but not deep. Therefore it depends what you need it for. Overall I wouldn't recommend it.
2,not as I heard,after watching an utube video I decided to put this product. one word --- Don't.I don't think it helped at all. I may try it on something else but as far as the scratchon my iphone --- no difference. On u-tube it was used on an ipod.
2,Does not work as advertised.,No amount of elbow grease would restore my screen to 'as new'. Not even one scractch. Very dissapointed and feel this was a waste of money and time. Alas I think it is too late to get a refund.
5,WOW!,"I was so mad at myself when i scratched the face of my iphone with my engagement ring. It was a pretty deep scratch that was about 1/3 of an inch wide. I thought I would never get it out! I searched online for ipod scratch remover and found idrops, I thought I would give it a try but had no big expectations.I started with an old cotton shirt and followed the directions exactly. After an hour, I started seeing some results but my thumb was starting to blister - then I switched to Q-tips. Best idea ever! After about another 60 minutes (and a few dozen Q-tips)the scratch was just about gone. I worked on it a little bit over the next few days with Q-tips and the scratch is now gone!! My boyfriend thought I got a new phone!It took a lot of work, and a lot of Q-tips - but my idrops purchase was well worth it!!!!"
5,"Try it, it works",This is just what the iDoctor ordered -- an easy way to take out the annoying minimal to moderate scratches on an iPod screen.
2,REWEINED MY HOME BUTON,it destroyed my home button. had to replace it.... cost me another 25 dollars + 5 hours of my time to replace it... wouldn't buy again... it also just made my scratches on my iPhone 4 worse... horrible product....
1,DOESN'T WORK!!!!!!,"It's a waste of money I don't know if all of these amazing reviews are put up by the sellers to attract people to buy it or if they are real buyers and it worked for them but I bought and all it did is make it kind of shiny, I know you have to apply it more than once and I did...literally about 15 times for this one medium sized scratch in the middle of my screen and it's exactly the same....DO NOT BUY!!!!!! I recommend iKlear from apple, it's a bit more expensive but I bet it will work better than this product."
1,Useless,I tried everything as instructed but did't do any thing for me. Try your luck if you want to.
3,Doesn't work very well,I spent several hours trying to get a lot of scratches off my old video iPod 5G. I followed the directions adding a few drops and rubbing with a soft cotton cloth. I would say the improvement was minimal at best. There are still a lot of scratches on my iPod and it is hard to watch videos on the screen.
1,not as advertised,"This is a very fine abrasive polish. For the time and effort involved, I saw no improvement and would suggest you go to ebay and purchase a new housing for your phone or other devise if possible. I've since ordered a new housing for my phone. I have also seen just the front part of my phone housing for sale. It may be worthwhile to get extras if you have an exposed display or alternatively use screen protector film."
1,Not pleased with results....,"I followed all of the directions carefully and repeat the step way over an hour, and just saw more scratches. Not happy!!"
2,Dont bealive the good reviews,"I bealive what the people write about this product so I tried and it doesnt work. My ipod have the same scratches, but a little little little bit less the only things that really change is that is more shine or bright. I tried it on a cellphone and nothing change."
1,SCAM!!!,Does not work. If you need your screen fixed Apple will do it for you if you call in enough times. Someone will fix it for you for free.
1,This product does not remove scracthes!! Don't waste your money!!!,"I tried this product and followed the instructions precisely. It couldn't remove even the tiniest of scratches from my screen. And believe me... I polished for 30 minutes just as the directions had instructed me.Complete waste of my money. I was disappointed to say the least. It did however make the screen clean, but that is about all it does."
1,Garbage scratch remover,Dn't waste your money on this product it is the worst scratch remover its garbage my galaxy note scratch no change
1,Does NOT Work,"Got this because my iPad 2 has a few surface scratches on it (NOT deep scratches) and I scrubbed and scrubbed on it with a cloth and the scratches would not come off only made my iPad screen really clean thou, I do NOT recommend this product! DO NOT BUY!!"
2,Not really a scratch remover.,"I bought this product for it touted ability to remove scratches given enough time. Well I've spent 2.5 hours buffing two small areas with both microfiber cloths and q-tips, moderate to hard pressure across the scratches, and I will say the scratches are less prominent. However, the scratches are still just about as noticeable as before. The area with shallower scratches faded, but hasn't gone away by any means. The deep scratch looks the same. And yes, like other people have noted, it will take off the oleophobic coating making fingerprints stick on the screen very easily, should your screen have had such a coating before application. If anyone is wondering, I tried this on my Nokia Lumia 920. Maybe the Gorilla Glass is just resistant to this stuff."
1,doesn't work and changes screen feel,used this on my phone that had a scratch...rubbed over and over with new drops for an hour and it didn't do anything! it did change the composition of the part that I rubbed though...so it collects fingerprints more easily. BE WARNED...THIS TAKES OFF THE COATING ON THE SCREEN THAT PROTECTS IT FROM FINGER PRINTS!!!!!!!
3,iDrops removed some ipod touch scratches,"I purchased iDrops because the chrome back of my ipod touch had a lot of small scratches. I followed the directions, buffed for about an hour, and used almost half the bottle. iDrops polished and cleaned my ipod very well, but it didn't seem to remove many scratches. However, it made them less noticable. Overall, I think it is worth the price, and I am going to try again."
2,"Nice cleaner, terrible for scratch removal...","This is a really nice cleaner but it terms of removing scratches, it only removes little insignificant scratches."
2,Doesn't work on htc Nexus One,I tried this product for 2 hours continuously on HTC Nexus One following all the directions using cotton balls but it didn't help at all. It made couple of scratches worst than before so don't use it on anything other than iPhone because people are claiming it works on iPhone but it failed for me so be careful.
1,DOES NOT WORK! (4g iphone),"Absolutely, positively, does not work. Should be taken off the market. I rubbed and rubbed, and dropped and dropped, and shaked and shaked for over an hour. I followed the instructions to a T and it did nothing on my 4g iphone. Not even on the slightest scratches came out so forget about anything you can feel with your fingernail. Plain and simple, if the product worked, the idrops website should show an example of it working on real scratches on real products in a video. I actually woke up with a sore hand and shoulder."
2,Not so great,"This is not what you want to be using for your acrylic iPhone backing. It pretty much just hides the existing scratches by making more tiny scratches, looks like crap when you're done.The reason I am not giving this 1 star is because it did an OK job on the chrome around the iPhone glass.I wish I would have bought an acrylic scratch repair kit, probably the same stuff that FILLS scratches on eyeglasses."
1,Must have gotten a dud,"Followed the directions to a T. After spending over an hour rubbing this product on, it did nothing. Maybe it worked for others, can't see how it did but nothing for me. waste of money"
4,Bright - Well built - Should come with a case,"This is one of Coleman's timeless designs. The PowerHouse model is a bit brighter and allows the use of dual fuels. The build quality has remained the same compared to my 10 year old single fuel model (still using) so I expect this to last as long. No need to worry about disposing or using up propane tanks. Good fuel capacity and long life of lantern makes this a must have for any campsite. Also great for outdoor emergency use in a power outage. Easy to find replacement mantels.This item would have easily gotten a 5 star if not for the following,1) This should come with a case, for ease of carrying and packing - to protect the glass.2) Still requires a long lighter or match to ignite unlike the northstar versions with ignition (but harder to find mantels)."
5,Great Lantern! Worth Every Penny! Buy ONE!!!,"I just recieved this lantern in time for the May 24 long weekend up here in Canada. I set up the lantern last night in my backyard to test it out and man was I surprised how much light this thing puts off. The lantern can illuminate a circular area with a diameter of about 40-50 feet (using coleman fuel not unleaded gasoline). This lantern will pay for itself after a year or two by not having to by batteries or propane cylinders. I do a lot of camping and this lantern will make it that much more enjoyable now that I can see while I set up my tent or eat dinner. I cannot really attest for the durability and/or quality as I just received the item and only time will tell if it lasts. I can confirm that the lantern looks and feels well built and durable. The lantern is great for car camping or boat-in camping, but if your going to be backpacking/portaging I would recommend something a little smaller and lighter."
3,It Provides Light,"It is an OK lantern that provides light at night. I did not try it out using unleaded gasoline, so I am going to assume it works OK using it (We used Coleman Fuel for it.) It is not too heavy to carry around, although it is way too heavy to hang on their very own Coleman Packaway Deluxe Camp Kitchen as the pole sways way too much. It was easy to setup and the included mantles worked great.The big issue on the one I received was that the adjustment knob was too sensitive to adjust the intensity to anything other than Off, Low, or High. There was no way to adjust it anywhere in between."
5,Great lantern,"I bought one of these two years ago before a family camping trip. Since then, it's been used quite often for sitting by the firepit in the backyard and also for when we're having outside parties. It even sat for about six months without being used, and the fuel tank was still pressurized (accidentally - I forgot to relieve it before storage, but I was really surprised it held pressure for that long).I like this one much better than the propane types, I can carry a half a gallon of fuel for a weekend instead of a dozen propane bottles. It seems to be a bit brighter than the propane ones too.Of all things, be sure to get extra mantles to go with it. If they get damaged or fall off, you won't be able to use the lamp. And add a few drops of oil to the pump to keep the o-rings good and wet every once in a while."
3,Wouldn't turn off.,I used the lantern during hurricane sandy when the power was out for 2 weeks. It worked fine and lit the backyard just fine.The only problem I had was that it would not shut off. When I turned it off a small amount of gas would still pump in. The only way to get it to shut off was to release the pressure by opening the fuel tank. Not safe or recommended. Amazon was great with the exchange. I have not used it since then so I can not comment on the new one. I did use gas in it and not the coleman fuel. I will use the coleman fuel in the new one as the gas smell was over powering when used in the lantern.This may be because it was still pumping a small amount of gas after it was shut off.
3,Good PR for the Queen,"This is a good quality production that lets us have some insight into the life of Queen Elizabeth 11. Although the documentary is entitled The Royal Family at work, its mostly about the Queen. Some parts are much too drawn out like ALL the detailed preparations for the Queen's arrival in the US, it just goes on and on.Its interesting to see how much this 82 year old monarch does, and also her children, however, I did miss seeing the unique interaction between this family, they all seem to work independently for the same cause, so to speak."
5,A Roman Treasure Hunt,"This book is set in the Roman world at the time of Julius Caesar. It is the second in a two-book set telling the adventures of a young Roman matron and her younger brother. They are the niece and nephew of Julius Caesar. These two books are at about a 5th or 6th grade reading level and give an accurate picture of what life was like during the Republic of Rome. While the main characters are from a patrician family, Ms. Lawrence also shows what life was like for the slave and freedmen. This book has all the excitement of a treasure hunt and the solving of a mystery and will appeal to both boys and girls. It is a sugar coated way of seeing what the time of Rome was like."
2,NOT XXL BY ANY MEASURE,"I purchased this product to go ontop of my very beautiful, new, high-end wood stove. For the amount of money this thing cost, and the description given, I was severely disappointed that this item was so very small. My stovetop tea kettle is significantly larger. It is a beautiful item, and the handle resists getting hot while the rest of it can steam, so it is what I was looking for other than the size."
1,"Horrible ""addition"" to the turtles","I Hated this movie, it was nothing like the other 3 movies that were great! I do not recommend this movie!"
2,OK but the 3 original TMNT were better!,This 1 is okay but I still think those other 3 were a lot better than this 1. This ruined the Ninja Turtles. They didn`t evan need a next Mutation. Shinobi is sooooooo dumb that this movie shouldn`t evan be invented. Don`t buy it you want to see it realllllll bad RENT IT!!!!!!!!!
2,OK but the 3 original TMNT were better!,This 1 is okay but I still think those other 3 were a lot better than this 1. This ruined the Ninja Turtles. They didn`t evan need a next Mutation. Shinobi is sooooooo dumb that this movie shouldn`tevan be invented. Don`t buy it you want to see it realllllll bad RENT IT!!!!!!!!!
1,"Man, that is jacked up!","This movie is HORRIBLE (the shows were horrible). It was a bad attempt to resurrect Ninja Turtles. First off, the Ninja Turtles had only 4 turtles, and the idea of a girl turtle is just stupid (not that females are bad, it just ruins the Ninja Turtles). I am a teenager and I was an avid Ninja Turtle viewer and I love the Ninja Turtles, but when they remade it, that changed everything and it made it dumb. It insults my intelligence and everyone who watches it becomes dumber."
5,Cool with 5th turtle!,This movie rock`s&roll. No April O`Neil and no Casey Jones. Their bandanas look awesome few characters but who cares. Five turtles with the best filming and a new bad guy! ...! Turtles Rockkkkk!
3,This is not another Ninja Turtles movie!,"Forget what anyone says about this being a Ninja Turtles movie. This is not a movie! It's the first 5 episodes of a short-lived live action Ninja Turtles TV show. If you don't believe me, then check out the official website: ... This show wasn't as good as the original cartoon but it wasn't all bad. However, I thought that bringing in a 5th turtle was a bad idea. All Ninja Turtles fans know that there are only 4 and that's the way it should stay."
2,I was expecting more . . .,"I was one of those fans who actually WANTED a female turtle. But Venus was just HORRIBLE!!! A little naivity is one thing, but she was just plain ridiculous.Also, why the changes in their masks? Raphael's looked like somebody cut it out of a sheet of material with a butcher knife.And . . . my biggest gripe . . . WHERE'S APRIL O'NEIL???"
2,Not what I expected...,"I liked it ok, considering I AM a hardcore Turtle fan and all, but I was expecting something more. The style was too fake for me: the costums, fighting, and such. Shredder and the foot were a bit too.. too... I dunno dramic. The actors drew out the scenes a bit too much. The Dragons were more like idiots from hell, although I thought the scenes of them in the mirror were pretty cool. Venus.... what's there to say about her? She relays too much on her magical powers, gving me a bit of a turnoff.And... were are the guys' BEDS!? HELLO! What about APIRL!?!?! For crying out loud people! Get a new director and costume designer as well as better actors! Then I'll give ya' another heads up on what I think! GEESH!"
2,I thought this was an independent film for sure!,"If you have ever seen the Original Cartoons and The Original Ninja Turtle Movie you know that the story lines don't perfectly match, but at least they were close. As a child you don't really care that much anyway. But... I was shocked to See Shredder still alive and well. The costume was terrible. Splinter looked more fake than ever.The only thing that was remotely the same as the other movies was the Turtles and some of the funny one liners. I don't mind that they added a girl turtle, but they should have fit her in the second movie. My 2 1/2 year old likes it just fine. This is not so good! It's a tragic way to end such a fun childhood memory."
3,lightweight sink,This sink is ok but is very light weight steel. I was expecting it to be thicker steel. I am in a hurry to get moved into my house so I installed it. I am not sure how sturdy the enamel coating is either we will see. If you have the time look around for a heavier sink.
1,"Tea is great, seller messed up and I got the product very late after emailing multiple times",I love this product.My skin has cleared up a lot.I love the tea.5 Stars for the good product.Seller never sent my tea.I had to email several times and remind them to ship it to me.The product arrived in good condition with no apologies from the seller.Will buy the tea but with some other seller.
5,Never been to Spain...,"...but I kinda like the music. Literally hundreds of cds perchased by me on Amazon and this is my first review. why break the silence? Quite simply because Spain (or more specifically Josh Haden) breaks the same endless silence with a whisper of love and pure genius unknown to most pop music musings. This man is a fractured-tormented-childish weaver of sublime emoting. His dad is best know for some legendary bass string bending in the jazz world but Josh has cornered the market on gut wrenching, heart-felt sentiments that are at once deathlike and birthright. There is virtually no diffence between this and the first two Spain cds. All are courageously brilliant. They make me cry. they make me smile. They make me remember all the times I've cried and all the times I've smiled. Only one other music maker has this power...Scott Walker. Go figure. Go to Spain immidiately. It might be raining there but the sting of drops will feel amazing on your brain."
2,More of the same from Spain,"Don't get me wrong. I loved She Haunts My Dreams. In fact, I urge you to buy that record instead of this one and be done with it. If you have She Haunts My Dreams, you don't need this one. There is something to be said for artists who stick to what they do well rather than veering further and further away from their signature sound with every release. However, Spain is marching in place with I Believe. There is nothing new here that differers in sound or subject matter from their previous release. In fact, the lyrics on this CD seem to have all been written in one sitting and are virtually identical song to song (how many songs on this CD really need to start with ""Oh girl...""?). It's a nice, mellow record, but a disapointment from a band that seems capable of more."
5,swing down sweet chariot stop and let me ride,"love the p funk sample love the chronic love how they got george clinton himself on the remix along with michel'le, snoop, and daz ain't nuttin but a parrty. party on the mothership."
3,Beautiful shoe - way too small,"Received the shoes today. Looked great - just like a high-dollar pair I saw at Nieman's. BUT - they were way too small. I ordered the size I always wear (size 10 - I even had my size re-checked at a shoe store before ordering). I am returning them and re-ordered a size 11 since they appear to be about 3/8"" shorter than my size 10 Johnston-Murphy's. If they fit, I will post an update."
2,Vastly under-sized,"It is a fine looking shoe, but the manufacturer obviously cannot interpret a sizing chart. I ordered an 11.5 EEE, and what arrived was marked as the correct size, but was so ridiculously small that I couldn't cram my foot in it at all. I estimate the actual size to be men's 8 or 9 with C or D width."
3,Beautiful shoe -- NOT true to size!!,"This is a gorgeous, well made shoe -- if only they had fit my husband. I knew as soon as they arrived that this was the narrowist EEE I had ever seen. My husband couldn't even get his foot in them. I can't imagine what a regular width show would be like."
2,not what I expected,"this is actually a list of places that sell ""green"" materials- like a specialized phone book. I think most of this information is on line, and that we will need to buy things within our local area- not from the other side of the county. we returned this book."
4,Great snack!,"These little cups of couscous are superb snacks. The curry is not spicy enough to throw you off, and the lentils are a great choice. The taste of the couscous is just right: a hint of curry, and the nutty smoothness of lentils. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because of the 12 cups, three contained a mix that seemed to have gotten moist somehow. All the others contained a very loose, dry couscous mix.These are great to take with you for lunch (as long as you can get your hands on some boiling water). I'd maybe take a chicken breast or a cup of other veggies to toss with the couscous so that it becomes more of a meal, but as a snack? Great!"
1,Not for me,"I was really excited about this soup because I was looking for a somewhat healthy snack and it seems just right. However, I found that the soup has a stronger after-taste than any other taste. I am now left with a stock of 11 packages of soup I cannot eat... I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Sorry."
3,Okay,"This isn't a bad lunch, but a bit lacking in flavor. Be sure to use boiling water and leave it well covered for the full five minutes."
4,Good & Basic Soup,"This soup is good, easy to prepare, stores well, and has healthy ingredients. To me, Couscous seems to be like a rice version of Grits ;-) It goes well with a sandwich or other part of a meal. The price was very good also, at less than $1 for each cup. I enjoy it. I hope this review is helpful."
4,'Ironman origin' review,"This felt like '80s animation watching Ironman. The music is a strange mix of organ, pipes; I didn't care for the opening theme.I did like the idea of Tony using Thermo-energy as a source for a Chip Plant. Pretty clever idea for a comic. Also, Tony stark was charging up on energy where ever he could -LONG before we had USB cables :)The bad guys are pretty forgettable and uninteresting, except perhaps Fin Fang Foom. I liked how he didn't follow thru with his promise to the Mandarin. The Scarlet witch has a,um, lets say 'a very racy outfit'. I was sort of raising my eyebrows to see this in a cartoOn- not that I'm complaigning or anything! I wish the series had better villians and more guest stars."
2,Average at best,"Like sound quality and pushbutton tuning. Limited reception, does not do well with weak stations, $90 twin coil added antenna is a farce and seems to make matters worse. The radio itself is far overpriced, a little Walkman gives better reception."
1,Overrated Piece of junk,"I can hardly think of anything good to say about this product. I'll just list a few of the worst things:1) Buttons that stick - as in ALL of the buttons on the top of the unit. Even when they weren't getting stuck inside of their circular cutouts, I oftentimes had to repeatedly push them just to get them to work. Awful.2) Poor FM reception compared to the old radio it replaced in the exact same location3) A dial light that ALWAYS comes on when you power on, but NEVER shuts off when you power it off4) A weather warning that interrupts whatever you might be listening to, even for something as unimportant as ""high ocean waves""5) Mediocre sound quality6) Not inexpensive, considering all the issues aboveUnbelieveably, CCrane would not allow me to exchange the unit for a higher price radio, even though I offered to pay whatever would be the difference in price. I am a happy owner of other CCrane products, but this one is a grossly over-praised POS."
1,Burnt twice!,I so enjoyed the sound quality of my first CC Radio - that I ordered a second one within a year after the 1st...Then the LCD screen began loosing segments - making it difficult to read. Then the LCD screen became totally unreadable....Within a short time - the SAME PROBLEM struck the 2nd unit..By this time -- both units were out of warranty...However - BOTH units clearly demonstrated a poor design or poor quality issue that struck both of my units..This MUST indicate there are LOTS of defective CC Radios out there..On contacting CC Radio - I was informed it would cost $85 to repair! Such a deal..Avoid this radio - like a plague.
1,Didn't Work,"This charger did not work and actually when I plugged the playbook in, started to make all of the screens I had open flip back and forth, which is dangerous for the device."
3,AT&T 210 is better for the price,"This phone is ok but I would recommend the AT&T 210 (or whatever it's called now). The Clarity sounds nice and loud but the light on top is a joke. Nearly invisible in a normal lit room. If you were staring at the phone in a dark room when it rang then the light would help you. Otherwise forget it. Plastic feels just a bit thinner and cheaper than the AT&T 210 also. Not a terrible phone, but not that great either."
2,Review of Clarity Amplified corded trimline phone,This phone did not meet the needs of my 88 year old father in law.There was to much static and feedback when the volume was turned up to its highest level. It made it very difficult to hear the conversation at the other end. I returned this item for a different Clarity model.
2,Okay phone but missing some critical features,"I bought this phone for an elderly relative who is both hard of hearing and has memory issues. While the phone does amplify adequately, it requires you to push a boost button every time you receive a call in order to turn on the amplification. This was not acceptable in our situation nor was it mentioned in the description of the product. I called the manufacturer and they told me that their higher end models have an override capability in which you can leave the amplification on permanently. This phone also does not have any speed dial buttons. I had to return this phone and get a different model."
2,Buttons don't work well,This phone sounds clear and works well except for the dialing. If you are not very careful to hit the buttons just right it enters the number when you push it in and when you release it. Sometimes have to dial several times to get the number to enter right.
1,Clarity Amplified Corded Trimline Phone,"Even though I do not have a hearing loss, I have to press the amplification button to hear the connection. The phone transmits too softly unless the amplification button is used. Also there is static and an echo on the line. The keypad does not engage smoothly. It could be the reason that I am experiencing wrong number connections - numbers not even close to what I thought I had dialed."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this phone for my elderly mother who has hearing problems. She has lots of problems using the phone. I happened to use it recently and had the same problems: poor sound quality; intermitant connectivity; people on the other end of the line couldn't hear me but I could hear them; loose connections on the cords and plugs. The phone has some good features such as a sound boost button, but they're poorly executed. This is not a good quality product and if I'd saved the packaging the would return it."
3,Cyclometer review,"I purchased this wireless Cyclometer. I was impressed how simple the wireless setup was. Unfortunitly, I did not read the fact there are features missing that I assumed were part of the electronics. No clock access! (have to be stopped for the unit to go into sleep mode). No Average speed, no top speed? I cannot return the item since it is past the 30 days so I'm stuck with it for now."
1,smh,"So when I open the box of six disks , more than half of the tabs are broken so almost all the discs fall out , that's not the worst part , so when I pop in disc 2, "" which clearly says disc 2 "" it starts playing episodes that are suppose to be on disc 5 , . So I thought that sucks, well maybe the disc that says disc 5 contains episodes normally on disc 2 and its just a mis print . Nope so unless u want to pay for a incomplete series with two disc 5 go for it ."
4,DRagon ball z season 3 review,Every thing was good just didn't get my episode book. Otherwise it had everything else. I got it fast. Shipped to my door. If u lil dragon ball z git these DVD set.
4,Ka-boom,"Freezer: ""This planet will blow up in five minute!"". Twelve episodes later till planet Namek blow the f*** up.That is the reason why I TAKE OFF ONE STAR! But the fighting, action and the story line. Kick ass five star. BUT COME ON! Twelve episodes to make that planet Namek ka-boom?? -_-"
4,Dragonball Z Season 3,It is good to complete the saga. But you will probably only watch it once or twice. So buy it cheap or rent it.
4,One of the best seasons ever,This is the season where Goku turns super saiyan. It's awesome and frieza is quite a challenge. I REALLY suggest buying this season.
2,Good but defective,Product arrived on time and perfect for a gift. Unfortunately there was a problem with the DVD. The person who received the DVD set just recently opened it and saw that the first disc seems to be factory defective and doesn't play. I know it's kind of late to get a refund but at least an exchange of the product would be greatly appreciated. Besides this everything else was good.
4,Gift,I got this as a gift for a friend and she really like it. It came in great shape and was just what I wanted.
3,Good,THIS SEASON THREE SET WAS NOT BAD AT ALL..IT WAS BETTER THAN WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE..BUT IF YOU ARE A DRAGON BALL FAN YOU SHOULD DEFINETELY GET THIS DVD..
3,Goku vs Frieza .,"The showdown with Frieza . well , Goku fights Frieza , and fights and fights and fights , it should end here , but he continues , and fights and fights and fillers and fights and fillers an....... you know the drill . but if they continue releasing it this cheap , why not buy it ?If you are frustrated like me from the filler episodes in this season , start buying the manga. Read volume 12 . it starts with the last five minutes on Namek . and it's not as boringly long as the anime's .Same fold-in box of six cd's . but this time you get six episodes on the first three cd's , and five episodes on the remaining three. The extras are textless songs and trailers.Isn't time for funimation to release Dragon Ball cheap box sets ?"
1,this is fillers,"this is the worst season of dbz, and i love dbz but i have to say this one sucks! its just trash talk from freiza and little outbursts of angry fighting. it is boring and was not enjoyable , with one exception, when goku started smacking freiza around like a hoe"
5,Dragon ball 3,This is the season three of Dragon Ball Z. It has amaizing fights and a break through in sayin power to compete with Freezas power. Great addition to a growing colection or just a great gift to be wateced over and over again.
4,Pretty F'n GOOD,"Season 3 features the exciting finale to the Frieza Saga of the DBZ series. There are some seriously sweet moments in this season. There are generous amounts of filler too however. And one gripe I have is that (mini- SPOILER ALERT, but nothing big) after Frieza attacks planet Namek itself and threatens Goku that he only has 5 minutes left before the planet blows up, there is like literally half the season left and the fight ends at the end of the season. So basically, like half of the season (15 episodes?) takes place within ""5 minutes"" of ""real"" time on Namek. Me and my friends found this time disparity much less bothering by translating Frieza's time of ""5 minutes"" to ""5 hours"". If you keep in mind that 5 mintues = 5 hours in this season, it become MUCH more enjoyable. With only 5 mins left, you think the end is coming any minute for 15 episodes, so the filler gets really annoying. Just remember to translate the time."
4,Dragon Ball Z - Season Three (Frieza Saga),This is one of the best animated cartoons that ever came out. And this is one of my favorite sagas. Especially when Goku turn super sayian. I recommend anyone who likes Dragonball Z go and get this saga.
4,One of the best season yet,"True to Dragon Ball Z form, season 3 is one action packed adventure. The fight with Frieza rages on and each episode is more exiting than the next. Histerical freak out scenes from the women of DBZ as well. Many, many hours of great DBZ fun!"
3,"Decent, but needs more (and better quality) examples.","I was a bit disappointed with this book - I was hoping for a lot more ideas - most that were shown were pretty weak designs. Books like this are mainly idea books and the more ideas, the better. This looked like a half hearted attempt. Unfortunately, I haven't found anything better. There's a definite need for a decent book on this subject..."
4,"Better Homes & Gardens Trellises, Arbors and Pergolas",I was looking for a book that gave specific directions for several types of structures and in particular pergolas. This book had great pictures and the directions for construction of a pergola were simple and easy to follow.
5,Arbors & trellises,"Another great book from the BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS series! A great book for women who garden & who also want to build their own garden furniture for vines to climb up on etc.Great step-by-step instructions, superb illustrations, explains about the different types of wood, markings one sees on the planks in home improvement stores, covers carpentry (beyond just the basics) needed for construction of trellises, arbors & pergolas."
3,great for beginners,This is a great place to start if you're not sure what all those knobs do. There are also some wiring tips and sections about some of the off board gear and the principle of use.If you've been running sound for some time you won't find much here you don't know but there will be a few tips here that I found useful.Gain structure is probably the most important thing you can learn about sound and this book and/or video does a good job covering it.
5,Tons of Stuff for the Neophyte,"This book has tons of information. It really explained a lot about running live sound, especially for someone who knew little about it before hand. I'd recommend this as a first book for someone looking for information on live sound."
5,One of the last seasons that was great unti Dino thunder,"This season was great. The ending was sad because zordon was destroyed. I wounder how are they getting their powers know since he is gone. I liked the megavoyager, athe astromegaship (WHich was destroyed in a future season) and the other one that zane had. I still watch the show and i am only 16. Know they finally brought back a good character back. I wounder if they will bring back the rest in future seasons?"
5,I LOVE ASHLEY SHE IS THE HOTTEST BABE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I LOVE ASHLEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,It rocks!!!!,You should keep selling it till I am 100 years old!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Nice to look at but in the shop quite a bit,"I bought this watch because it was an automatic, but it has some problems. I am getting ready to send it back a second time because it is losing time, at a rate of 6 minutes a week. It looks nice, but is big unfortunately. I have read a few others have had the time loss problem as well with Tissot."
4,Excellent watch,"This is a pure Swiss-style watch. I love it. It's design is wonderful. The only ""disadvantage"" it may has is that it is automatic (not quartz), hence if you leave it for 1-2 days without wearing it, you have to update the time."
4,"Patina BAsics, Tim McCreight","Arrived in good shape. Information on disc for Patina's on metal were everything i hoped they wouold be. Easy to understand, and follow. But, Tim McC. is alwaysreally good."
1,Contents a surprise,"This book looks like it would contain some wonderful information and for the cost of $30.00, one would expect that they would allow a preview--which they do not. I buy books with previews to ensure that the topic, projects will be something I am interested in creating."
2,"Try to buy a book, get a CD","Try to buy a book, get a CD. The picture show is a book, but I got a CD. What I can say?"
2,Sort of works...,"Nice player, but... a) doesn't play some disks. Just doesn't detect them. These disks play well on 10 years old Sony player and $20 CD walkman, b) CD-RW recoreded on Sony CD recorder don't play. They play on $20 CD walkman. Each time I insert CD I pray that it will be recognized. If plays, plays well. By the way, it is 6 month old...I don't know whether it is just defective, of this is the ""feature"". Have to find the service...More: ergonomics questionable. Cannot program sequence of CD playing, can do this only on track level. My 10 years old Sony has no problems with this."
5,Blue Hawaii / Paradise Hawaiian Style,"excellent in wide screen. Blue Hawaii has alaong been my favorite Elvis movie. The Hawaiian Wedding Song as they float down the stream, what a dream wedding."
4,"Blue Hawaii: Yes, Paradise, Hawaiian Style: No","Blue Hawaii is classic and essential Elvis. Great beach party goofs with a great soundtrack.Paradise, Hawaiian Style--on the other side of the ocean--is a really terrible knock-off of Blue Hawaii, which Elvis shouldn't have done.The plot and the music are sub-standard when compared to Blue Hawaii, and for some strange reason Elvis's hair is visually died extra/extra black and super slick/greasy looking.Anyway, this collection is worth buying for Blue Hawaii and it's reasonably priced, so just skip Paradise, unless you're a completist."
1,This show is soooooooo bad.,"Do not get any of the MMPR films or TV shows. they all are so dull. well mote of the Scenes from the show are cool, but this show is soooooo bad. O.k. you get my poit by know, i does go."
1,garbage,"I browsed through this book at the local bookstore. All I can say is don't take any pointers from this guy. He says before placing bets on ""any craps"", you should wait until the die hasn't produced craps for atleast 18 rolls???? He says after this the probability of any craps showing is 88 %. What is this all about? The truth is the odds of rolling craps is the same (11 %) regardless of how many times it's been rolled in the past. If you already own this book, I suggest you take your loss and throw it away."
2,Bible Exposition Commentary,Did not remember seeing that this commentary was only for the old testament history. Wanted a the entire Old Testatement.
5,love this series,"fun movie, i really like all the characters and the 'in jokes' playing on other movies and charactersgiving Scrat a love interest was funny"
3,Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"This was for my child's Kindle. He says it was okay, but nothing special. I am sure we will be ordering other videos in the future for viewlng on his Kindle."
1,stupid,i thought this was the movie i was downloading. What a waste of time! I've seen better behind the scenes video too.
3,Ice Age Junkies,"Ice Age junkies will enjoy this, but for the rest of us, this is just a short free clip that helps advertise the brand."
1,"save time,dont watch this","crap, waste of time, the idea of placing short of what stupid things the did while doing the movie its just waste of time."
1,not a movie ?????,"i searched for movies and on the right side of the screen it said free... so i clicked on it, it is not a movie, i feel i do not get much at all for the membership i pay for, they claim i get a bigger discount but if i sign in as a non member i don't see a significant difference at all. Dont list this 10 min stuff with movies please,,,"
3,Misunderstood,"I thought this was the movie when I rented it, my mistake. I misunderstood. It is a good preview of the movie, but all it does is make you want to see the rest. lol"
5,"Thought-provoking, interesting, and a little convicting","I have met the author (last name is pronounced 'shee') and heard him speak a few times. His writing style reflects his speaking style: easy to follow, casual voice, yet punctuated with substance and information. While not preachy, Hsu encourages us that Christians are called to be Christians everywhere - including the 'burbs, but he challenges us to think about what that might look like and whether we can consider what God is calling us to do in our neighborhoods and churches. Extensive endnotes can lead to further reading on the subject."
1,Ruined by drowning out Brook Benton with loud music,This CD sounds like it was re-recorded with new music or something. The music drowns out the singer. I just thought it was poor quality in general.
5,Brook is still Mr Debonair,I'm replacing a lot of my music that was destroyed in a fire. Laid back Brook Benton is awesome. His style of music will never get old.
5,Excellent book describing consciousness scientifically,"Most of the works on eastern philosophies can be difficult for scientifically minded people to accept. Especially the idea of meditation when most westerners have not experienced it. This book describes what biochemically happens in the brain to cause these feelings. It not only describes kensho and other zen states but it descibes near-death experiences, actions of drugs on the brain and how fear and other emotions form in the brain. Definately get this if you are interested in backing up altered states of consciousness with scientific understanding."
5,Excellent,"James Austin took subjects like Zen, Meditation, Neurology and Consciousness, and explained them and their interconnectedness thoroughly. It is definitely one of the most informative books on this subject, but only if you are a serious practitioner of meditation."
3,Not as Funny as Pinky and the Brain,"Less humor than the nickjr hit cartoon ""Pinky and the Brain,"" but then again who cares about that analogy. The book's packed with research tib bits of psychological wisdom and cognitive significance. You'd buy it to complement your William James tombs that sit on your bookshelf. Be smart and just read through it at your local bookstore---I know I did. I do wish I could have taken it home, but it is rather BIG, and besides, I didn't want to empty my wallet. I'll wait for this one to become available online."
5,Deluged by brilliance,"This is a fascinating and powerful book that should be required reading for scientist and theologians alike. However, as phenomenal as this book is, I would caution readers about the sheer density of this work. Tackling Zen AND neuroscience Austin does with grace and keen skill, but this book is 850 pages for a reason. Persons with only passing interest in Zen as it is written in coffee table books may be frustrated to the amazing depth of the text. Also, to some without any scientific leanings nor a strong interest in REAL Zen, this book may be overwhelming. Despite this warning, I found this book to be one of the most necessary to my library, aiding me constantly in both studies and personal growth. At times inducing insight, at times inducing frustration, at times inducing sublimity, this book is the best I have read on the phenomenons of both Zen and the Brain."
5,Excellent construction,"This little Omni mount is extremely well built, and assembled flawlessly. If, like me, you appreciate quality components, and exceptional fit and finish in a product, then you will love this little guy....very sturdy and simple to adjust. I paid only $40 including freight at Amazon, and it sells for $100 locally.I am very pleased, and I am extremely fussy."
5,Excellent Product,"This was bought to replace a third failed Hadley 850D for the air horns on my motorhome. There is no comparison. The Hadley had an air filter about 5/8"" diameter, and the crankcase end cap constantly fell off. This one has an effective, replaceable air filter, robust crankcase design, and in addition, a built-in check valve.The Hadley had a 23% duty cycle; the 350C is 100%. And it pumps up the system in 1/4 the time, and holds the pressure for days thanks to the check valve.Since it has 100% duty cycle and runs cooler than its predecessor, I'll soon put a hose disconnect so I can pump up the tires."
4,'That old time Religion style',"This was an exceptional selection of traditional church hymns, (though it did lack the high church style that I was anticipating). None the less it brings me back to days of 'yore' in my childhood, memories of that old 'Church in the Wildwood' style, a pleasent suprise. As usual with live recordings it lacked the volume that better quality achieve but still a favorite that I have ordered twice (for my Dad too)."
5,Beautiful!!!,The pictures and the stories as told by these Queens wearing their crowns was extraordinary. It was delightful to hear in these womens own words the significance of their hats. Truly a celebration of Black Women.
4,Hats worn by Black Ladies,"This is a wonderful book about the history of hats for Black Women (the reason hats are important, the pride they have when they wear them).The book was used but in excellent condition and a reasonable price even with shipping charge.I only wish the pictures had been in color to see these glorious hats more true to life. Although the black and white seems ""right"" I'd still like to know what the colors are."
3,Truly Crowned Jewels,"The photographs of these women and their remarkable hat is fascinating. I really like the interviews with the ladies, and the unique stories of their lives and times.My only disappointment was that the picture are not in color. I would love to have been able to see those plumes and feathers in all their glory!"
5,Gorgeous elegance,"""Crowns: Portraits of Women in Church Hats"" brought to memory many Sundays in church when I was a child. Women walked with regal grace when wearing their church hats. I saw some of these women during the week and many were plain and quite ordinary in appearance. But at 11:00 on Sunday morning, they were elegant and stately as they strutted, in their church hats, towards their seats in the sanctuary. The photgraphs are as beautiful as the women they portray. This is a ""must have"" book for any woman who loves gorgeous hats and the women who wear them."
3,Solid,"I bought this CD player last year when I started seriously running to train for a marathon. I found this CD player was fine to run with, but after about 4 miles it became a bit heavy to carry and I had to switch hands a lot to keep from getting tired. This CD player is fine if you are only going to run 2-3 miles at a time, but if you are going to run more, I would suggest checking out a Nike MP3 player which is much lighter and will play double the amount of music.With that said, this is a good CD player, but it is a bit heavy for running. It does do a nice job of not skipping, and the fact it is water resistant is a nice feature many electronic devices do not have.Sony needs to come out with a Sports/MP3 player."
5,Great Sound,"Although it is a bit bulky, it is so rugged! it would take more then a hammer to break this thing... and the sound it produces is AMAZING! the best sound from a cd player i've ever heard! Plus ther is never any skipping."
3,Not what the movie Smoke (w/H. Keitel) is based on,"I thought this was going to be the story from which the movie Smoke is based. If you have not seen the movie, I highly reccommend it.Needless to say, since it was not what I thought it was going to be, I was dissapointed at first. However, this is a very easy and funny book to read. This book is not complicated, unpredictable or that deep, but if you are looking for a light, humorous book about small towns and misperceptions about the greedy capitalist, check it out."
5,Fun read,I ended up loving this book. Nothing is what it seems at first glance....and in the end it all pulls together although I'd have to admit there were times when I wondered 'where is this going?'. It's a fable that truly reflects a lot of life. It was a good read and I'm looking for another book by the same author.
1,"Departure, diversion, totally undelightful","Bradley is as talented as his biggest promoters suggest. His talent is totally non-apparent in this book. He has gotten away with some 'fantasy' in prior books, so he just takes that and whimsy to the unforgivable extreme here. If you hate Wal-Mart, you can say how and why in a much more efficient and effective way than this disappointing farce. Bradley should have had more pride than to let this one loose."
3,Sweet but...,"Yes a sweet OVA series and you do care for the characters to a certain extent. Well, to be honest by the time the thing came to an end I was emotionally exhausted by the excessive melodrama. It was to the point that the characters were more like caricatures than anything else. The end is on the way too depressing side and I feel like my emotions have just been played with just for the heck it. Did they want to show me a sincere and poignant love story or did they just want to make me cry? It isn't always best to try so hard to evoke emotion in the viewer that realism is compromised and in the end it was just too much. This would have been better if it was less over the top."
2,Non as Good as promoted,"Even for those who like drama, felt the writer/director abused on the scenes. It is very slow. And tries to hard to convince of the normality of homosexuality."
1,PRODUCT MISLEADING/OVERPRICED,This does not come with the wall mounting brackets and the picture plus description lead you to believe that it does. Not until the last line of the description at the bottom do you see that this does not come with the brackets. This Dealer is trying to trick you into buying the bar then when you realize it does not come with the brackets you will buy them for $100! This is not worth $200 for a pot rack.
5,Great explanations from a true virtuoso,I was fortunate to have studied with Dennis in NYC in the early 80's. Back then he was an amazing guitarist. I recently visited him in NYC again and was amazed at how much his playing hassweetened. Dennis is not only a great player but his explanations of the techniques are among the best out there. I recommend this book for any student who has played at least one year of classical guitar.
1,Not Flamenco - Fraudulent,"This is an attempt to teach flamenco the way it was before Camaron and Paco revololutionized it, but even then it's completely wrong. Flamenco was never played like this - ever.This is a classical guitar player faking it.For real Flamenco, only the didactic videos made by the Swiss company Encuentro exist. Some of these are good and others are mediocre, but at least they contain real flamenco played by real flamencos. No one in flamenco ever heard of any of these other people who have written flamenco guitar books.The Paco Pena Toques Flamenco book is the only thing showing the old way that's even close. It's a source of trditional falsetas but the compas patterns are obsolete. PIP falsetas are also obsolete.Don't take my word for anything, go to Spain and find out for yourself."
1,Item came damaged!,"I so needed this item cause the leak in my car's sunroof drainage system made the passenger compartment floor wet! and the mold started to grow on the back seat, right where my kid sits! so i got this product and it came damaged! the filler was on the outside of the pouch - thank god the pouch was in a plastic bag so I didn't get the filler all over myself and home carpet where I opened the amazon box. also, there was text on the cloth pouch that was completely illegible! it has some type of directions on it but I could not read it! very disappointed with the seller! returning this immediately!"
2,Cracked Pots not what its Cracked Up to Be,"No complaints with the seller of the merchandise, the book was just disappointing. Not what I expected."
4,Great wedding gift,I received this as a wedding gift and have happily given it as several wedding gift. Wonderful book for new couples and also those that have been together for years.
5,Great book,"This book is awsome. It starts from very basic information such as the nature of light to delve into specific details. For example it talks about facial features and how light affects their appearance through shadows, etc.Another great feature is that it gives images of an object or a scene under different types of illumination. Then there are long captions that describe how the scene was illuminated in each picture and what the results are.It contains very practical information such as how to light a grand piano, or how to avoid camera shadows and other common errors.It also talks about the actual design and eventual execution of the lighting and about lighting instruments and their use in specific conditions.Tons of diagrams help understanding and each of them is carefully explained.This book will help anybody understand the concepts and then it will become their close companion as it contains many tables useful as reference on the set."
4,Nice product,I bought this for the purpose of stripping paint off of plastic miniatures. I just soak overnight or for a couple of days and brush the paint off. It worked even better than I had hoped.
5,Cleans Saw Blades,"I read somewhere on the internet that Simple Green would clean saw blades, so I went to Lowes and bought a bottle for about $5.00. I've now cleaned six radial arm and circular saw blades with it, and am very pleased. I poured about half the bottle into a shallow 10"" plastic container and submerged each blade, one at a time, and let it soak overnight. As each was soaking, I rubbed an old toothbrush over the blade tips several times. After soaking I just washed each blade and dried it. Presto - they came clean. Surprised me. Now I can clean my blades easily after each project. Here's a link that gives more info about this: http://www.toolcrib.com/blog/2008/07/03/toolcribcoms-ultimate-guide-to-cleaning-saw-blades-and-router-bits/"
1,price check! thus one star.,"20120127, $9.90 @ Lowes, normal price, as opposed to $20.34 w/shipping from Shoplet on Amazon. Good stuff for bowling balls, 50-50 with 91% rubbing alcohol, both USBC-approved for use during play. Little pump mister bottle from the Wally, et voila! Lots of clean balls for no mucho dinero. 5 stars on product function."
3,It works as advertised.,"I'm concerned about the shipping charges continuing to go up, so I would do some serious price comparison before reordering."
1,"looks nice, but CAN'T use it!","They look great but the bolt seperates from the glass and you have no way to use it, and a problem to fix. Maybe thoughtful design esthetic, but what happen to FUNCTION FOLLOWS FORM?!!I hope Kosta Boda backs up their product and come up with some fix for it, as the 3 decanters I have (small wide and tall of the Macho line), 2 out of 3 are ruined.How frustrating not to be able to use these, and now having 2 that are capless.... they become a big waste when you consider each is $200 to $400."
1,"maybe looks nice, but isn't worth it as you CAN'T use it!","They look great but the bolt seperates from the glass and you have no way to use it, and a problem to fix.

3,More like a story book than an encyclopedia,"This is a decent book though I'm disappointed a little. First off the print is tiny, even for me in my 20's! I don't believe this to be an encyclopedia but more like a story book. I thought it was going to be like a real encyclopedia being able to turn to a certain letter and see that particular bike. It's the first motorcycle ""encyclopedia"" I bought. Don't let the product description get you psyched out."
3,Still good work,"Although this album is not one of Rufus's most consistent pieces of work it does contain some great material. ""Do You Love What You Feel"" is a classic and Chaka's vocals in ""Any Love"" are haunting. She starts this number out in that deep, rich, earthy tone and ends the number wailing like a horn. Other favorites are ""Live In Me"", which has sort of an enchantingly mystical feel to it and ""What Am I Missing"" Lyricly, that is the best number on the CD. To quote: ""There is an ill wind blowing with no let up in sight; Evil ill wind blowing and I've been up all night."" That's my favorite track on this album."
4,If you love real bands as I do...,"The intro of heavenbound can play on my ipod all day.This was truly an end of an era, Rufus was one of the best!This cd is a must have for all Chaka fans,even if only to hear her mellow vocals on What am I Missing."
3,pretty good but should have been better,"when you start an album off with a cut like do you love what you feel it can either continue the pattern of greatness or go down hill or just get caught in between.well this disc falls between the 2nd&3rd.it never really recovers.while produced by the producer of all producers Quincy Jones it doesn't challenge or even come close to his last production at the time Michael Jackson's Off The Wall.where with otw he&MJ clicked&didn't over do it, with Rufus&Chaka he tried to do way to much.still it's worth checking out."
4,1 good loop,The only reason to buy this is to loop the guitar riff when it breaks in on heaven bound. I put reverb on that and bang it all day in my jeep. word.
3,shoe runs large,I ordered in my standard shoe size and found it to be too large....since there was not a place to mark such on the Amazon return form...I kept the things and will see about selling them...go a half size down...these shoes definitely run large.
4,Great price,Great buy...wished I would have looked on this website before I went out and purchased similar shoes for 3 times the price..and they are not as comfortable as these shoes. Plus they are so much more comfortable. I am going to order another pair in brown.
2,Sizing way off...frustrating.,"I ordered these shoes after some careful selection of price, heel height, shoe material, and other considerations. I finally made my purchase, and the shoes arrived very fast, but unfortunately, though I've always worn a standard size 7-1/2 in shoes and recently bought a pair that fit fine in this size, these shoes were so big on my feet that my foot didn't even tough the back in the shoe when I put my feet into them. Adding padding or thick hosiery seemed therefore like a pointless idea, so I decided to return the shoes. I am frustrated that ordering in my regular size did not work.I also noticed that while I ordered a ""Wide"" shoe, these don't seem all that wide, so overall, this order did not work for me."
4,Good Windows Mobile 2003 device,"Lots of memory, VGA resolution screen, and fast processor make this a good Windows Mobile device. If you can tolerate Windows Mobile crash-happiness, this is good. You should look at the e805 model which is cheaper and gives you an extra software title."
2,No wired keyboard options,"The machine is fast, with lots of storage room. Lack of any compatible wired add-on keyboard makes it nothing more than an attractive paperweight, though. Wireless keyboards are very sloooow, and this unit won't stay on the wireless keyboard when the unit has the heavy duty battery installed. This unit is only compatible with certain USB keyboards, so that solution is not realistically available either. If you use your PDA to take notes via an add-on keyboard, buy IPAQ, not this one."
4,Djam Karet - 'Collaborator' (HC Productions),"Finally got the chance to hear an entire disc's worth of Djam Karet. Previously, I've only heard a few of their songs on a couple of various artists CD's. Sort of tough to describe but I'll try - part progressive art-rock and part electronic. Tracks here I got the most out of were ""Solar Flair"" (to me, sort of sounds like Styx on acid), appreciated the world music vibe of ""Gondwanaland"", ""Anointing Of The Sick"", the twelve-minute {low key} ""The Day After"" and ""Submersion"". Personnel: Gayle Ellett-electric guitar & keyboards, Henry Osbourne-electric bass, analog keyboards, congas & samples, Mike Henderson-six-string, slit drum & vocal effects and guest musician Steve Roach on didgeridoo. Enjoy."
4,"A good place to start, and come back to","Christian Zen is a good place to start for someone who is interested in Christian applications of Zen, but doesn't want to spend years researching it. It also has a lot of insights that are not apparent on a first read that make the book worth coming back to over and over again.If you're JUST looking for info on Zen, don't bother with this book,(it's about Christian applications of Zen). Try 3 Pillars of Zen by Philip Kapleau instead."
2,"Yeah, okay...","The book is poorly bound, and the content is rather dull after all. I think Pinter is over-rated."
3,dull but fast,"story line was extremely dull. almost nothing happened the entire 37 pages. as a play without stage directions, it made me completely depend on the dialogue, which consisted mainly of monosyllabic sounds and courteous questions (how's the wife, kids, etc.) leaving me with pretty much no real grasp on how the characters were as people and how they interacted physically (an important point in my mind since it focuses on a wife and the man she is having an affair with, and i'm left with no idea of how they physically are around each other..)"
5,A book for anyone who needs a lttle urge to carry on,"I read this book, and got plenty laughs out of it, along with a few tears. this book, and the oters like it, helped me to chnge my life ...read it, it's good."
3,"Okay, but quality? ...eh","Quality over at leatherman may finally be wanning... The knife blade on mine closes crookedly and stikes the liner in its motion. This dulls the blade.Otherwise it seems to do exactly as they say. Obviously, this is not meant to be a primary use tool....just a backup in a pinch. I understand that point, but I always used to view Leatherman as a company that ""rose-above"" expectations with their products."
3,limited in scope,"If you are looking for a field guide to the cetaceans of this area, please consider A.N. Baker's ""Whales & Dolphins of New Zealand and Australia: An Identification Guide"". The cetacean species accounts are brief, one-page summaries with limited information. Artist renderings of the animal are used instead of photos. In addition to species accounts, quite a bit of general information about evolution, reproduction, communication, behavior, strandings etc. make up more of the book than the species accounts. If I'd seen this on a book shelf, I would probably pass it up. I'd never pay $100+ for a copy (shrug)."
1,Yougioh final season part 2,I loved Yugioh and this season was great. That being said what I didn't like about this product was the false advertisement by the seller. This DVD does NOT have Japanese spoken language and English subtitles. I was very disappointed because the music and Japanese dialogue in this anime are superb.
5,A sad end to a great tale,Well if you are a avid Yu-Gi-Oh! fan as i am this is a must have item the last series of the original Yu-Gi-Oh! a great watch and some great new cards. May not be the best duel ever in Yu-Gi-Oh! but it rates very high. I dont want to give anything away but so i will give you the basic plot Yami must be defeated in a duel to free his soul and Yugi says he will do it. even if you just buy the dvd please get books as well as these go into more depth and are a must for any fan.
4,good bible study tool,"as usual david Pawson comes up with the goodies, (thanks to Kindle )an easy to read manual, the hard copy book is huge, but with Kindle so great to get through.This is a very good study book. I strongly recommend this book for anyone serious about studying the Bible"
1,Danger for use with Piranhas / Exodons,"This product in my experience will kill your Piranhas with in two hours! I used this product on 04/19/06, using the correct amount and using caution as the back of box notes! Witnessed signs of stress on my 8"" Piranhas, changed water ASAP! Piranhas died on me with in two hours of putting tabs into aquarium! My Exodons are still stressed breathing heavy and I hope they do not die as well. The $5.00 box of tabs costs me a $150 fish! Very up set with product! The box states to use caution which I did! No where does it say it will kill your fish with in hours even monitoring your fish!!! Sorry if this review is a little harsh but I am very ticked off! Put five tabs in a 55 gallon Aquarium!"
4,The Greatest Polka Dance Bands - All Polka,"This CD is 100% Polka Dance Band Music. There is some vocal but not on all selections. The quality is excellent. The Dance Bands are: Whoopee John, Frankie Yankovic, Six Fat Dutchmen, and Muron Floren. There are twenty selections presented."
2,Purse,I'm not impressed with the quality of the purse at all. Given that the price was so low I should have expected lesser quality--and it's not worth the shipping cost to return it! Lesson learned.
3,"Sorry, It just doesnt measure up.",Their first album fully deserved the bold cover art. It was classical music with two big hairy nads. This album is an insipid rehash of tame and lame folk music. Its like when Todd left the group he took with it all the testosterone and innovation. Skip this one if you love the first. If you bought this one then you havent really heard Ethel yet. Getthis oneinstead.
4,Exciting and Weird!,"First class sound and performance, the music itself has many good moments mixed with many questionable ones! I like it for its originality and sound, and less for its content."
2,Poor Packaging,"It is already difficult to find this product anywhere in stores so I was ecstatic when I was able to find it online. The speed of the delivery was prompt and on time but I was incredibly disappointed to open the packaging to find that the wax had burst open and spilled over everything. I ended up shipping the product back. So as a word from the regretful, if you need to find this product for your state board cosmetology test, don't wait until the last minute."
4,Good but not great,"This collection contain some but not all of the most famous episodes from the hit Sgt. Bilko series, ""You'll Never Get Rich."" The special features are good but not excellent. Although the commentaries provide insight, for example, they remind that the series was aired over forty years ago. However that may be, the best episodes retain their humor and spontaneity."
3,Where is season 1?????,"I love Phil Silvers and would purchase every season when and IF it is EVER released. What is the big hold up!!!Come on release the seasons one by one. No volume sets, just the seasons.You never see this on TV ever anymore! Bring them on and let us fans purchase the seasons!!!!"
5,comedy at its best,This is a 3 disc set with 18 episodes on it of classic Bilko very funny very interesting with DVD extras. After this wonderful viewing experience I hope more classic Bilko episodes will come onto DVD format.
3,Chain leash too small.,"This chain leash is not very good for large breed dogs. The leash is long enough; however, it is not really 1/2 (.5) inches thick. It's about 1/4 thick; which, if you're expecting to put it to a though/mean large breed dog. It will hurt your hands, rip apart the nylon handle, or snap altogether.I will use the Chain b/c I'm using it on my docile female old-English shepherd which was trained not to pull.Finally, the clasp is way too small. If you want to use it to grab a multi-ring collar, it won't work for you.If you need a though and decent-medium chain leash, this is not the chain you want.I recommend the Coastal Pet Titan over this one for a large breed dog."
2,Disappointed,"The latch is so small is will it not attach to my dog's collar. I needed this product to teach the command ""Let's Go"" in the basic dog training at PetsMart. I was told to use a 4' lead but unfortunately, I can't use this product. The latch on this lead is probably for a yorkie collar or a very small dog."
3,Complete but not convenient,"If you want a complete edition of Chaucer's works, this is the only one available. And there's no question of Chaucer's greatness. His language is arguably more beautiful than Shakespeare's, if only because Middle English is a more musical language than modern English. But you need good footnotes for Chaucer; here we have a glossary at the back, a set of textual notes in a separate appendix, and footnotes--so there are three different places that you have to go to for questions about Chaucer's language! A major editing blunder. In addition, there are no color images of Chaucer, and only one black and white image."
4,Be Prepared to Learn Middle English,"A great collection of Chaucer. It's hard to find his other works combined with the Canterbury Tales. The book is well bound and will be something that can be durable enough to stay on the shelves for decades.The entire book is written in Middle English however. There are plenty of footnotes, but often times the reader will need to find a translation to fully understand some of the passages."
2,misrepresented,"This book was advertised as new, part of an overstock. However, this book had been used. It had hi-lighting, as well as many marginal notes in ink."
2,"The Uneven ""?Father?"" of English Literature","If you are going to read Chaucer--and, truly to be educated, I guess one must--do not go to the trouble of buying this massive volume. Read a selection of the best, because so much of Chaucer is not the best that one wonders why read him at all. Perhaps the answer to the latter question is because of our obsession with firsts: he is one of the first British poets, and indeed a voluminous amount of his work has survived. As far as medieval literature goes, I find parts of the Decameron and all of Dante infinitely superior. If you really want to invest your time and money wisely, read the Riverside Shakespeare or the Riverside Milton...Leave Chaucer to the ""experts."""
5,A Beautiful Love Story.,This beautiful story takes the reader into the hearts of the two main characters. I actually cheered at the final outcome of the story. High on my list of must reads.
3,Not Her Best Album,"This album stated the new Kylie era. Kylie's music was now more adult one...""Confide in Me"" was number two in UK charts. It is quite scary track because it tells about desperate mind. ""Surrender"" is so referessing. ""If I Was..."" and ""Where Is the Feeling"" are classic Kylie. They are that kind of tracks that can be listened to as background music but if you want to know them better you need to listen to them deep. ""Put Yourself in My Place"" (I wonder what the title means...) is also a hit from this album. Other great tracks are ""Where Has the Love Gone"" and ""Time Will Pass You By"" which are both quite happy tracks musically...but not lyrically.Stars: Time Will Pass You By, Put Yourself in My Place, Confide in Me"
4,Good Book!,"This is the first Wesley Peterson book. It took a while to get into the rhythm of the read. Once I got there, I was enjoying the book. I found him an interesting detective. The British mysteries are not as sensationalized as American mysteries, and I have to learn the culture. It is nice to have an intelligent, thinking detective for a change. His background in archeology is interesting.I think some British mysteries tell more about the culture that leads to the death(s), and the detective holds his opinions close to his vest. Then suddenly the thoughts are poring out and the chase is on. Good read!"
3,minority opinion,"If you're looking for a light, entertaining mystery, The Bone Garden should do the trick. Ellis is a competent writer who can intertwine plotlines and keep dialogue moving. But my opinion of Bone Garden isn't quite as glowing as other reviewers', mainly because the solution to the central mystery becomes evident about 2/3 of the way through. Characters are also somewhat two dimensional, with their relationships weakly portrayed. Wesley seems rather distant from his wife, for example, and shows little emotion regardless of circumstance. Worth reading, nonetheless."
2,Cheap controller - in price and quality,"If you're looking for a 3rd and 4th controller for parties, then this is for you. I got a pair for under $20 each. The layout and size is very much like the Microsoft S controller. Unfortunately, the buttons feel mushy, soft, and cheap. The quality is also inconsistent. For example, the left thumstick on my controller have a ""click"" when you push down on it (as it should), but the right one doesn't. Some of the triggers scratch against the frame, and they don't have the same tension. The left trigger feels solid, but the right trigger feels too soft. I wouldn't use this as a first or second controller, but at its price, it's great as a controller for parties."
1,Misleading advertising!!!,"While the controller looks good and may be well made, I bought it because it was advertised as WIRELESS and IT IS WIRED!!!!This controller is WIRED!!!THis controller is WIRED!!!"
1,Please don't be a victim by buying these cheap items.....,"........these are cheap and cost pennies on the dollar to ship....yet he charges over $4.00 in his favour because he doesn't want to advertise honestly that it costs only .23 cents to ship, so he lowers the item price then raises the shipping and lies to you. On top of that...he sends you tons of e-mails that harass you afterwards. I have e-mails that prove it!!"
5,Three books in one.,"James White is one of the first sci-fi authors I grew up with and in fact is one of the first authors, right up there with Zane Grey and Robert Heinlein, whose books I learned to read without being pushed into it by parents or teachers.The first book in this omnibus is really a bunch of short stories put together. These stories help us to understand how Sector General came about and allow us to see where the main characters of Conway and O'Mara came from. It also allows the reader to get use to how the hospital deals with everyday problems, ill aliens and special VIPs.The next two books are full length novels, one about war and the other is about one of the biggest patients you'll ever read about. A 511 pages full of humor, drama and optimism. James White believes that, not only can we all get along, even with aliens, but that we could thrive working together. He believed in the humanity in everybody, including aliens!"
4,Nice to get them together,I have been trying to find some of the included stories for some time and it is nice to see them collected as one volume.
5,Think your friends are strange?,After spending some time at Sector General where the humans and aliens learn to interact with the main purpose being to give health and understanding to all; most of the people we meet on a daily basis here on earth who may have peviously seemed a bit strange are not so unusual any more. I love this author. He has a beautiful mind and develops interesting and unusual problems to be solved.
5,Greatest listening to an era of real music.,This CD really brings you back to an era of real romantic music. Easy listening that makes you drift back to a time when romance was at the top of the charts. This CD really makes you want to have lived in the era of the recording.
3,"great idea, not so great book","still a good book, but not as good as crews' other books. still, it's one i'd recommend."
2,"Measurements not accurate, price far too high","Measurements misstated in item description. The 2 inch x 3 inch candle is actually 1.75 inch x 2.75 inch. I already knew I was paying a steep price for a 2 x 3 inch candle, but the price I paid is truly a rip-off for a candle even smaller. I regularly buy 100% beeswax candles locally, at stores and farmers' markets, as well as online, for much better prices and similar quality. Would not recommend these candles at this price."
2,Burning Time,"I really did not feel that the burn time was long enough. I had similar candles that burned a lot longer. Also, so much smoke came from the flame eventhough I constantly cut the wick as suggested in the manual. All in all, not too happy with it."
3,Worth it as an occasional treat,"Pro's: softer light and subtle scentCon's: faster burn, need to trim wick and address tunneling more frequently, higher price"
1,Burn poorly.,"These candles burn poorly. They do not burn evenly at all, even if you try to only burn them for 30 min at a time."
2,Candles do not light,I can not get them to light and stay lit. I ove beeswax candles and was very disappointed. I am too busy to return and I will melt them down to make other candles.
1,mtk,"Candle was fine but it had a dent on the top, it wouldn't matter if it were for me but it is a gift and I don't want the person to think I got it at a discount since 25 bucks ain't cheap for a candle! I am probably going to return it if I have the time. Won't order from them again though."
4,Impress your friends by re-telling these stories...,Van France has done a remarkable job in this book of recounting his experiences with Disneyland. What I found most interesting were his tales of the early years...when I worked at The Park I would occasionally recount one of his stories to a fellow Cast Member or interested Guest...they are wonderful to share with everyone! Do yourself a favor...find a copy of this book!
3,Wouldn't it be Nice.........,"Finally someone was nice enough submit an image. We can at least now know what this book looks like...thankyou J. Coleman. Up until now, I wouldn't have had any idea.Last published in 1991 this book has had much praise...and it baffles me as to why it isn't in print.Wouldn't it be nice if some publisher picks this book up and decides to do a re-print?I have seen this book for sale on second hand marketplaces for 100's of dollars.Come on, let's get this thing reprinted and stop this insanity.Sounds like a fantastic read from the reviewers and it would be really nice if a new version is printed at a reasonable price."
5,Beautiful book and informative!,"This book is great for a beginner. I went to the library to find a book that would tell me how to dry my valentine roses. I so thourghly enjoyed this book I am going to buy it for myself as well as for others as a gift. Not only does it tell you how to dry flowers, but it demonstrates step by step how to grow them, and different ways to arrange them. It has beautiful pictures in it with arrangements from elegant, country to modern - something for everyone. I highly recommend it. It makes a lovely tabletop book as well as a reference book. The author Cathy Miller has designed flower arrangements for presidents throughout the years, even for President Clinton who has allergies. Cathy has designed the flower arrangements for him encased in glass!"
2,"Well, it's a package, I guess","This CD might as well be called Polka Dance Party, Volume 5. Like Volumes 1 through 4, which have also been named Polka's Greatest Hits, this collection of old, probably public-domain material leaves a lot to be desired. The sound is weak in both the volume and bass departments, and the Whoopee John tracks sound as though they were recorded directly from shellac 78's recorded in the 1940s. Stick to the better Frankie Yankovic releases, such as Songs of the Polka King Volumes 1 and 2."
5,Good Polka music,"I'm just learning to dance the Polka. This is the liveliest and most fun music I've danced to. There are a few Waltzes on the CD, but the rest of the Polkas are great!"
4,World's Greatest Polkas,"This is for polka lovers. Some of the selections sound like they were recorded at real dances but close your eyes as they play and you can almost imagine you're there, too."
1,Don't Waste Your Time (or money),"This collection is assembled with very little, if any, thought to editing. The CD has a very wide variety of polka styles, eras of recordings and quality level of recordings. If you're looking for music to assign to playlists, you will find more songs to discard than ones to keep from this CD. For nine bucks, I don't mind the gamble, but I certainly will not revisit most of the tracks. The recordings on this CD from Whoopee John were probably recorded shortly after Whoopee was discovered."
4,"Can be difficult to get through, but is totally worth it","I enjoyed this book and felt it gave a lot of insight into who Jim Elliot was. It was sort of sad going into it, because you know the outcome (assuming you know anything about Jim Elliot and his story). It was fascinating reading about how he fell in love with Elisabeth and just his devotion to God.Some of it is quite dry, as I'm sure all journals are, but I appreciate that they didn't leave that stuff out, because it made the rest of it more real."
3,"Doesn't have the flow of ""Through Gates of Splendor.""",But it is more autobiographical. Excerpts from Elliot's diary are interspersed with Elisabeth Elliot's explanations of what was going on in Mr Elliot's life at the time. Does give good insight into the life of the man whose death may have done more for modern missions than his life ever could have.
1,DVDs STUCK,I too have had problems with this system- My DVDs got stuck (i only had it for less than a year)- i sent it back to get repaired- only to have the machine come back STILL BROKEN!!!!!The sony repair phone line is atrocious- I spend at least 20 min on hold before i speak to someone who has to bump me up to the next level.Dont buy this system- its not worth the hassle.
3,Excellent...when it works.,"I am experiencing the exact same issues with this system as the previous reviewer. Trying to work with Sony to get these resolved. Unfortunately for me, I didn't begin using the system until roughly the end of the 30 day period in which I had a window to return it to my local retailer. Now I'm compelled to work through warranty services. If enough of us are experiencing these defects, Sony should take the responsible route and satisfy its customers. I've called the local ""authorized Sony Service Centers"" and none of them seem to be responsive to this issue or are otherwise backed up with repairs that they do not feel compelled to deal with this."
5,2 years and no problems,"I love it, compact, nice.. had it for over 2 years and had no troubles at all. I have checked when dvds skipped and they skipped on my other 2 dvd players also. Overall no problems and I love it... if ny of you other guys want to sell me your remote I would love to buy it as mine got chewed a bit by the dog... still works though."
2,"DAV-C770 has very inconsistent, unreliable performance","I took a risk in 2002 and bought this system when it was launched. At first, the performance met my expectations for sound and video image. Over time, the player has had increasing difficulty in reading many discs (even clean, new ones). Even after cleaning the laser, once the unit heats up the video problems pop up again. Movies that are playing fine when the unit is cool, will freeze for a few seconds or just stop playing altogether. I am becoming more and more frustrated with this product since I have come to expect high quality from SONY. I am also convinced that the slot loading has something to do with the poor performance. I have an older SONY drawer unit, and it is fine. Also, no problems with CDs. Finally, the sound is remarkably good for a compact system, and I am pleased with the sound options. For a compact unit, SONY was on the right track, but this system missed the mark. I hope that subsequent products are better."
1,Worked fine for almost a year..,"The same thing happened to me, and I have read numerous reviews online that the system stops reading DVDs after a while. I thought it was a fluke for a while and waited a bit too long. My one year warranty expired and now it doesn't play dvds at all, even brand new ones. It's odd that CDs work fine.Don't bother. Sony has lost me as a customer. When you pay $500 for something, you expect it to work longer than one year."
1,Sony sucks - Never buy a Sony,"This expensive piece of junk looks good, but is a real headache to own. DVDs always seem to get choked on this system alone - the same DVDs work perfectly elsewhere. Then on top of it my DVDs got stuck. Tried calling Sony but never got a satisfactory answer - they want you to always keep it powered off with the plug pulled out from the socket when not in use - they want you not to put in more than one DVD at a time though its a 5 DVD changer. It is horrible... I will never buy a Sony again, and neither should you"
2,Sony DAV-C770 DVD Player,"I already have this unit,BUT it started freezing up,So I decided to look for another one since all the speaker wires were run through the walls and all I needed was the DVD player itself.I received the unit. In less than a month it also started freezing up.Now I have two units that freeze up and I'm out $150 Also the unit showed up filthy,the speakers had rips in them and the packaging was at best terrible.I could over look the filth,the rips, even the packaging all I needed was the player itself and it to was bad.I was in contact with the seller and there was no indication the unit was in bad shape,I was assured it was in good to very good condition.Be careful when purchasing items on amazon."
1,Same problems as others have - can't play DVDs,"At least now I know I'm not alone. My unit has had the same problem reported by others--the DVD playing feature is very poor; most disks get skips, stuck, or just stop altogether. I called Sony service and after 45 minutes of snail-paced data-taking the call center encouraged me to send it in for flat rate repair, but after reading the other reviews I guess there's no point to that. It would have been nice of them to tell me that it was a common problem."
1,It skips on almost every DVD,"Every other DVD will skip. Everything else works and I guess from reading the other reviews I am one of the lucky ones. I believe that they should recall all of the systems or at least repair defective components.I am very, very reluctent to buy another Sony product ever again.With how much this systems cost they should work!"
1,Sony just lost a valued customer,"I have had the same problems that everyone else has, with the dvd's skipping and freezing and not playing, and frankly I'm just fed up. I came about an inch from throwing it out the window of my apartment today and I'm gonna recommend that you don't buy this model, or any sony. It's unreasonable that they won't help me fix the problem or even admit that there is a problem. Really somebody should lose their job at sony for releasing a piece of junk like this. I know from reading all the reviews that sony has lost a ton of customers. I invested so much money in a brand I thought I could trust. I feel I was betrayed by sony. My advice, don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Piece of junk!!!!,"I have two of this; bought one for my Dad, one for myself. My Dad complained about it not being able to play discs (DVDs). Now I have both. Mine worked for about 6 months, and now the damn thing no longer works. [...]"
1,"Do Not Buy This System, Unless You Want Trouble!","I bought Sony because I trusted the name...seemed like a good price and good value. DVD started skipping and failing within a few months after purchase. We only used it 1-2 times a week. We thought it was because it was overheating and wasn't getting enough ventilation.Now, 18 mo.'s later, the DVD fails and the changer won't even read a disc - you can't even insert one. I started two chats with Sony and no one admits to a problem or need for a recall. After reading similar reviews, I realized Sony knows they have a problem, but since it happens out of warranty, it's not their issue.Consumer, beware!"
2,"Finally, somewhere I can 'vent'.","I hate this P.O.S. - The disc changer is 'god-awful' slow to prep and eject (agonizingly). NO way to know which bay the DVD you want is in on the first try. Load time is also way-slow. My $30 cheapy DVD player recognizes more disc types and file types (jpg, avi, wmv, etc.) than the DAV-C770. The Remote is a joke - small, and too many, buttons with even smaller print. It only has two fast-forward speeds (2X and 3X) The only reason I use it is for the 5.1, otherwise (for kids movies) I use the $30 cheapy.The Tuner and Aux ports are fine and I use the Optical to play tunes from my computer (pretty cool)."
1,Unreliable and expensive to repair,"We purchased this unit and have found it to be highly unreliable. The disc changer failed after less than 70 hours of infrequent use. A warranty repair lasted less than 30 days, upon which the unit was returned. The diagnosis this time was that a motherboard needed to be replaced, at a cost of over $400.Sony customer service is indifferent and ineffective. Two calls totalling one hour and forty-five minutes have resulted in extended hold times of at least 20 minutes and no resolution other than a solution for getting the stuck cd's out of the unit.If you don't plan on keeping this unit for more than the warranty period, it might be an appropriate purchase. However, if you're looking for a product with strong durability, the Sony DAV C770 fails miserably."
2,Worked for a while...,Sony was one of the best products you could ever buy but this one seems to be something of a misfit. My box never took too kindly to a recorded MP3 mix (super trax) & the changer has recently croaked... 5 of my favourite CDs are parked inside the unit! The 1-year warranty was done several months ago so I'm now planning to attack the problem with my handy-man toolbox. Would advise you look elsewhere!
2,Did nothing for me,This was another disappointment as far as energy and alertness. I felt nothing different even after doubling up on the dose. I think I still have half a bottle or more left. I wasted money. I have since went to cheaper and more effective green tea that you can get at the grocery store.
3,Don't forget to add this to the price of the TV,A full day of lost wages...The delivery company that Amazon contracts with gives a delivery window of 8am to 5pm - so I need to take a full day off of work to sit around and wait for this to show up.
2,Great Picture... When its working,"The T.V. itself is fantastic and sets the standard for picture quality in a DLP set. The problem is it keeps breaking. I've had the set one month and have had 3 repair visits they are giving me a new set now so we'll see how it works. From what the repair man has told me this is common with this set. If it works it is a great T.V. Since some of the sets have a problem where it randomly shuts itself off.... not so much. You can roll the dice and see if you're fortunate enough to get a working set, but I'd suggest looking at others before making this purchase!!!"
