3,"Disguise, eat, write, ad nauseum","About halfway through the book, I started getting bored. Reichl comes up with a persona, creates a disguise, eats at (mostly) fancy restaurants, and then shares her review. The book has no real forward momentum, it's mostly a collection of similar vignettes.I enjoyed her previous two books a lot more, and the tales of food mixed with her personal life and loves was a lot more entertaining. I'm glad she has a good husband and a beloved son, but their presence doesn't make for exciting copy.I am also glad Reichl is using her considerable talents more than she did during her years as a NY Times restaurant critic. It's quite an overrated profession, and gathered into book form did nothing but reinforce how pretentious and excessive these restaurants can be"
3,Behind-the-Scenes Delight,"This book is less autobiographical than Reichl's other two books, 'Tender at the Bone' and 'Comfort me with apples.' Nonetheless, this book is a great read and hilarious. Reichl talks about moving from being the restaraunt critic for the LA Times to the NY Times. It is great to read about how she dresses up and goes undercover to see how regular, non-rich people get treated at restaraunts. Great stories and pleasant to read beacuse Reichl has the gift of sounding like your friend and that she is right there telling you what happened to her today."
2,Famous critic is B-O-R-I-N-G.,"Although it was entertaining to read about resturants I will never get to eat at, I found the dialogue,style, and story boring.I don't know what I was expecting, but my book club wanted to do this book & I did not enjoy it. Maybe newspaper articles are better."
3,"Ruth teased me, I wanted more","It took me over half of the book to warm to Ruth's ways. I felt too many times she built up a scenario and left me hanging, wanting to know more. I was desperate to find out what happened... if there was any comeback from the charity couple, how the guy she duped on a date with her sexiest disguise reacted to finding out he had in fact been dining with the NYT critic, what the Chinese restaurant who had diligently faxed menus back & forth felt when she decided to unceremoniously dump them for some other venue, after so much effort to please her.Its a light read and charming enough, but my appetite was whetted and I craved more gritty details."
3,book review,"This book was very entertaining, and the mind pictures that she creates from her descriptions are wonderful. The narrative of meals described while dining was so real that it made my mouth water to think of the tastes she was portraying. A very good book and quite funny. Looking at food and meals out have a different perspective for me now!"
4,An Enjoyable Read,"For fans of Ms. Reichl's first two books (as well as fans of M.F.K. Fisher, A.J. Liebling, etc.) this book may well be worth reading. Yet, one longs already for the ""revised"" version where the names and descriptive characteristics are not changed and we are able to experience not only her lovely writing style but also more of the 'real' story. The book is charming throughout; it is just that the apology at the end (rather than at the beginning) for 'exaggerating the details' leaves a bitter aftertaste."
3,"It was OK, not my favorite but entertaining","Ruth describes getting her new job at the New York Times, the odd characters she works with and picking restaurants. I do like the fact that she would go to a restaurant at least three times before rating it, usually once as herself and other times in disguise. I did not enjoy the descriptions of the disguises, they seemed to go on and on. I more enjoed the descriptions of the staff at the restaurants and how she was treated. I liked the way she picked the places, one time she followed someone into a sushi place. I enjoyed her relationship with ""Carol"" but kept wondering where he little boy was during all the times she was eating and spending time with Carol.Overall, not bad. Definately not one you couldn't put down."
5,I loved it!,"Ruth writes with such passion about her love of food that I get a sense of what it must be like to be loved by her and how joyous it would be to be in her circle of life. She is sensuous, loving, knowing... Add to that powerful sensation her honest desire to educate and entertain her readers, she becomes a tour de force. Ruth is gifted with the wisdom of knowing the common denominator that binds us all together - food, food, fabulous food, and has a unique ability to take us to a higher level of enjoyment through her lush and sumptuous voice. I want to dance in my kitchen and tease my guests with the promise of a delicious crispy roast chicken and a lovely piece of creamy cheesecake."
2,Secret should mean intrigue,"For a book without much of a plot, intrigue, or even character development, it was OK.There are hints that she feels guilty about spending so much time away from her son but that goes nowhere.The food descriptions are luscious but get old after a few hundred pages.I even tried one of the recipes - the roast chicken. It was as dull as the book.Ms. Reichl must have gotten as bored writing it as I did reading it because it ends with the thud of a meal with no dessert."
2,No Need for Reservations.......,"I was so disappointed in this latest book. Loved ""Tender to the bone"", loved ""Comfort Me with Apples"", love your magazine, HATED ""Garlic and Sapphires"".I just kept thinking that it was going to get better and more interesting and it just didn't. And the recipes just happened out of the blue and were not very interesting.Don't bother buying. Wait until it hits your local library."
4,Great book despite worn condition,"My wife and I are happily going through the early chapters of this book, which arrived in somewhat less than sterling condition, proving the old adage that you get what you pay for."
3,Book Club read,This was the book my book club picked for last month. I would never have picked this book myself to read. It was very interesting and gave me a different perspective on dinning out and the restaurant industry. Ruth Reichle is one smart and interesting lady.
3,Garlic and Sapphires,The reviews got a little long at times. It was interesting to read of the disguises she picked and the recipes were interesting. Just a little too wordy which made it tiring to read.
4,Reichl does it again,I love this woman. She writes books that are full of information and fun. Always a good foodie read. I just wish she would write faster!
1,why so pricy?,I prefer to read on my Kindle but I can't see the justification for a higher price for the digital edition for this 6 year old book than for hardback or softcover. It's ridiculous and I won't support the publisher in ripping off Kindle users this way.
4,A page turner!,"After listening to a couple of interviews with the author on NPR, I knew I had to have this book. Knew I was going to love it, but didn't realize how much, and on how many levels. After starting it, I realized I had to read quickly so it could be included in the late Xmas package for a daughter ~ who loves it as I knew she would."
4,Food in a social context,For me this book gets 4 out of 5 stars. The missing fifth stars says more about me than the book. Five stars would require taking my breath away.The book appealed to both my passion for food and cooking (complete with descriptions of amazing meals and recipes) and the sociologist in me (Ruth Reichl descriptions of how she was treated in various disguises). The book also offers a reminder of the power of food and dining as social experiences that creates connections to the past and to identity.
1,Beware - Kindle edition full of mistakes and typos,"The book and authorship was quite fun, but the poor editing of the Kindle edition make reading this a disaster - there are numerous places where words have unintentionally been split into two (e.g., ""Mor ton's"" instead of ""Morton's"") and a few where a whole paragraph has been repeated. I love my Kindle, but it's immensely frustrating to actually pay two dollars *more* for an eBook that is so poorly edited and put together. Don't buy this as a Kindle edition!"
4,"Interesting, Entertaining, and Well Written","I loved this book. It was educational and at the same time highly entertaining. There are several themes going on in the same book. First there is the actual review of restaurants and education of food and wine. Second, there is the truth about restaurants, food, and service that is exposed. Finally, there is the journey of the author and what she learns about herself, desires, and needs. All three themes are woven seemlessly to make a highly fun book to read."
4,Made me want to eat out more,Ruth's description of the lift of a restaurant critic was both a fascinating read and mouthwatering at the same time. Her descriptions of the disguises and deferring treatments in New York's finest restaurants made for a quick page turner. Her recipes and reviews scattered in each chapter made me both want to eat out more often and try to cook some of those dishes myself.
3,Garlie and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise,"I loved Ms. Reichl's first two books. This one was good and I enjoyed reading about her New York Times' experiences (and back flashes) but it didn't have quite the pizazz as her others. Still worth reading, though."
2,Disappointment,"I decided to buy this book after hearing an interview with Ruth Reichl on CBC. It was the first book I've read by her and definitely the last. Yes, it was interesting to read about the different treatments she received based on perceived social status; however, I found it rather too much when she was ""becoming"" a different person, timid or obnoxious, as soon as she put different clothes on and a wig. Also, after a few chapters, I started getting a little annoyed with her constant ""I found myself saying"". There are also remarks in the book of how Mrs. Reichl finds New York people rude; ironically I found her character (her real character) rather pompous as she rarely had anything good to say about others but plenty of criticism."
3,First two were better.,I preferred Tender at the Bone and Comfort me with apples. Reichl does describes the meals to make you feel as if you were there eating with her.
2,Conspicuous Consumption,"This book left me feeling like I consumed too much, uncomfortable and wondering why I spent so much time doing it. It's a little interesting in the way that it's a little interesting to know what Paris Hilton is saying and doing. In fact it may be exactly the same as reading this book. The author is good at describing food but not that wonderful at making the stories involving. Her fascination with herself bleeds into bizarre as she dons disguises at various times. I found her reviews and the peek at the underbelly of the New York Times fairly intriguing. However, the uncomfortable feeling comes from my understanding of how the privileged in this country have taken conspicuous consumption to obscene levels and we all become participants by glorify them. I don't want to know any more about Paris Hilton or read any more food orgies thank you very much."
2,Not What I Expected,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I expected to read more about the inner workings of NY restaurants, not recycled reviews from the New York Times. I thought it would be interesting to read about how she fooled restaurants with her various disguises. I did not expect to read page after page of where she bought the wigs, how she found the clothes, etc. etc. You can only read ""the tastes exploded in my mouth like hundreds of little fireworks"" (not a true quote from the book) so many times before you start skipping over the reviews. Save yourself some money and read the actual restaurant reviews from the Times' archives. I wish I had."
4,FUN FACTS 'BOUT OUR FAVORITE SUBJECT!,"There are lots of fun facts in this book. Although I found it short, I thought it was a nice book for yep, you've guessed it: QUICKIES! For those who are interested in the little facts 'bout sex, and you've read ""Sex: A User's Guide"" by Stephen Arnott (which I highly recommend BTW), this is a great book to add on to what you've learned. There are definitely things you haven't known before."
3,Mildly Amusing,"This book contains a ton of info about the ""taboo"" subject. Lots of obscure info about sex-related stuff that I didn't know about before and could've died without knowing it. Some of the info was on the disgusting side. Most were decently amusing. Good book to stump your friends with some weird trivia."
4,Crying Heart Tattoo,"The Crying Heart Tattoo is a story within a story, a style which I like very much. It takes place in the Midwest and is full of rich characters, a little magic and it has a very fulfilling ending. Overall a good read."
5,My dad rules.,This is the best American novel I have ever read. I guarantee that you'll love it if you give it a shot!
2,Didn't live up to the hype,"I read The Crying Heart Tattoo with the highest expectations. I had heard rave reviews and was prepared to read a compelling love story. I was sorely disappointed. The author sets up the female character to appear confident, worldly and strong, yet he has her act weak and pathetic. Her so-called backround was unbelievable when compared to her actions. I never felt an unbreakable bond between the two characters. The writing was obvious in some instances with too many cutsey lines repeated a bit too often. The ending felt tacked on, as if Mr. Martin just ran out of story. The book lacked depth and all in all was just not a compelling read."
3,Nothing new!,"I read her first book entitled ""The happy Hacker"" I was fastinated hoping to get more info of legal/illegal hacking but found little about it. I feel her first book was till the best while her 2nd book..more of entertainment coz more about herself, her friend and setting up linux server (partition HDD and etc). Lots of the information written here can still be found in her first book. Better read ""Hacking Exposed"" than this book. Sorry!"
1,One star is too many,"Outdated methods, sophomoric approaches and ... tricks comprise the bulk of this text that represents what the security community has come to expect of Ms. Meinel. Only the most ignorant of novices could possibly be duped into thinking this is any sort of advanced penetration manual (Even the term ""Uberhacker"" is outdated vernacular from 1996).While the intent to disseminate hacking knowledge to the unwashed masses is certainly an admirable one, the cautious reader is better off taking some programming and administration classes and perhaps picking up a copy of Hacking Exposed."
1,"Author is either incompetent, or a crook, possibly both.","DO NOT BUY THIS! This lady is either incompetent, a crook, or both. This book is poorly written, has no flow, difficult to read, and gives the reader little information worth retaining. What little reliable information is in this book is outdated, and so poorly written as to be a joke.Her stories about the FBI remind me of that old Bloom County cartoon where Oliver frames Steve Dallas for hacking. The FBI arrests him, and the judge overseeing the case states ""Mr. Dallas, you couldn't even pick your nose, let alone operate a computer, I hereby find you innocent of the charges."" I am sure that's EXACTLY what the FBI said after talking with this lady for all of 5 minutes.Buy ""Hacking Exposed"" instead, you will be a much happier person for it.Anonymous Information Security Administrator for the largest telecommunications company in the US."
1,erm.,Words can not express the contents of this book....well none that I would be allowed to type in this review.unless you want a laugh buy a book like hackers exposed or Hackers beware.
1,"Low cost, little light","I own a more expensive shake-to-charge flashlight and was intrigued by the Excalibur's low price. I bought a dozen to give to my friends here in west Africa. Alas, the light emitted, while detectable, was so weak that none found it useful for them. And these are people who have no electricity in their homes!This was definitely a case of too-good-to-believe."
3,"Cool idea, a little weak on execution",Sure takes a lot of shaking to get it to work and then it is not as bright as I had hoped.
2,"disappointing from streamlight, great customer service","I recently purchased the green trident. As an avid night fisherman, I thought with the streamlight name with would be a nice upgrade from my cheap rayo vac headlamp from walmart. Well I was right about the upgrade as it cost double. However, the xenon bulb is worthless. It is not bright, in fact it is a dull yellow. It wont even shine past the side of the boat. The LEDs are great dont get me wrong. The xenon is not. The ray o vac is $12 and works much better.See my comment on great customer service from Streamlight."
5,My favorite CD. No exceptions.,"This is the album that got me obsessed with McCoy Tyner. the only problem is, none of his others even compare with this one. if you want some good jazz, buy this album. my favorite song is Recorda Me."
2,There are better Tyner albums...,"Simply, not one of his better recordings. Disappointing on many levels. And I love McCoy Tyner."
3,Eh.,"Ah, it's been a while since I've heard some good ol' morbid pop-punk. For those of you unitiated with the Ghoulies, they're really nice, friendly, cool, music-making people -- except that most of their songs have to do with death, witchcraft, etc. There is nothing wrong with this. In fact, I rather enjoy it, because I can never tell if they're being serious or joking. With song titles as ""(she's got a) Brain Scrambling Device,"" ""Don't Make Me Kill You Again,"" and ""(she's my) Vampire Girl"" you can pretty much figure out the lyrics without even hearing the band. There's one problem with that, though -- you should hear this band, because they are masters of the Lookout! pop-punk style. Plus there's girl vocals sometimes! You can't go wrong with a girl singing ""Have your way with me,"" can you?"
1,"Lumpy, hard to mix, sets up very fast","The bag label says it can be mixed with water but the instructions recommend mixing with floor leveler additive, then add water to make it workable. I did that and it took a lot of water, was still very stiff and lumpy. It was very hard to trowel and set up in about 15 minutes. The instructions say it sets up in 20 to 30 minutes. I wasted about half the bag because it set up too fast. The material has to be screeded and regularly checked with a level in addition to troweling, all in less than 15 minutes.For leveling floors, a self leveling material such as Henry's self-leveling underlayment, is much easier to use and does not require any expensive additive."
5,if you're a Mensan,"If you're a member of Mensa, anywhere in the world, please read this book.It will teach you some M-history. And everyone who wishes to take an active part in Mensa should know some M-history."
5,Spiderman (Backrest) Pillow,"My 5 year old son absolutely LOVES this pillow. It's really comfortable (yes, I tried it out too!) and he loves the fact that Spiderman, his favorite character, is on it. The colors are brilliant and he lies up against it while playing his video games. The best thing about it is that he lies up against it at night before bed while he's watching TV and it's so comfortable that he actually falls asleep without giving me any arguments!!!"
3,Neat Pillow back,Great for a toddler who likes to kick up his feet in the living room. Perfect for watching TV.
5,"YES, FINALLY!","Finally, a great movie from the 80's that we only got to see on occasion on the disney channel. I remember as a kid being glued to the TV everytime it came on. Carrie Kei Heim & Brigette Andersen were two adorable actresses from the 2nd film. (RIP Brigette Andersen, she passed at a young age.) And well, Hayley Mills no matter what age she is, will always be a legend..and definitely still a beauty.Well on the first half of the film, we see the twins in the original Parent Trap. (Hayley Mills times 2!) I don't think there are many people out there who haven't seen this film or are at least aware of what it's about.In the second (which I spoke of the actors earlier), we see the twins all grown as adults. It mostly focuses on Sharon, and her daughter Nikki. Nikki, who can't bare the thought of moving to NY & leaving behind her new best friend, Mary Grant. So together the two young girls scheme up a plan that will ensure no matter where they are, they'll be together."
4,Very Good,"I liked the product, I have always like the move. The time it took to get here was fine and the viewing was up to best."
4,The Parent Trap Double DVD Set,"I was a little disappointed at first whenever I got the dvd in the mail- I was mistakenly expecting it to be both the first version of the movie, and the one with Lindsay Lohan that came out in the late 90's. It is in fact the first version and the t.v. sequel that features Hayley Mills as a grown-up,single mom- her daughter wants to see her remarried, etc... I am happy that I bought the DVD, though. It's so great to have the original movie-it's always been a favorite of mine, since I was really young. And, the sequel is pretty cute, so it is okay that I made my mistake about what I was buying!"
2,Parent Trap II is terrible compared to the original,"Ugh,I loved the first one... a childhood favorite...The second is really pretty bad. Acting is bad, lines are bad, too much pop culture referencing the 80s icons...Buy the original without the sequel..."
4,Good original movie,"I really like the original parent trap. The second movie I didn't enjoy nearly as much, but I guess if you can get both for the same price you may as well give it a try."
1,DONT ORDER,"I HAD ORDERED THIS COLLECTION FOR MY MOM, BECAUSE SHE LOVE THE PARENT TRAP MOVIES. SHE HAD BEEN TRYING TO FIND PARENT TRAP II BUT COULD NEVER LOCATE IT. EVEN THOUGH SHE ALREADY HAD MOVIE I, I WENT ON AN ORDERED BOTH SINCE IT WAS SUCH A GREAT DEAL. NOW I KNOW THE TRUE MEANING OF YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. THE FIRST MOVIE WORKS FINE, AND OF COURSE IT'S THE ONE SHE ALREADY HAS. PART II WONT PLAY AT ALL. I WOULD HAVE SENT IT BACK, BUT IT WOULD COST MORE TO SEND IT BACK THEN WHAT I PAID FOR IT. BUYERS BEWARE, IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE DONT BUY IT."
5,Awesome movie,I have loved this movie from the first time that I saw it when I was little. I am glad to have bought this movie for my own collection. The movie came very quickly and in great condition.
4,"Lots of fun, as I had hoped","I've loved the original Parent Trap movie for years, and I finally invested in this DVD of Parent Trap 1 and 2 because I thought it would be fun to watch them with my little girl. We've had a great time watching these together! Hayley Mills is fun to see as an adult in Parent Trap 2. Both were clean and funny; I don't remember anything I'd mind my 4-year-old seeing in either of them."
3,Very good Movies,"I Love the Parent Trap movies. For people who have never seen these movies, you have know idea what you have been missing. The Parent Trap movies start with Hayley Mills who I Love. Hayley plays twin sisters who are seprated at a very young age because their parents get a divorce only to meet for the first time when they are both sent to the same camp for the summer. There, after they discover that they are twins, they come up with the plain to get their parents back together by switching places so the parents after meet face to face to switch them back.Partent trap II is about Sharon and Susan again played by Hayley Mills, are now grown up with families of their own. you will have to see it to find out what happens. i love this movie the best."
4,Great Vintage Movie,"I have enjoyed this movie ever since I was child. It was a great vintage feel, and the acting is wonderful. It's a lovely and fun film."
5,Lovely classic movie!,"There is nothing like the original movie and the original cast to evoke memories of my girls watching this and laughing as they sat upon my lap. I love the two leads in the movie, Maureen O'Hara and the male lead who is now gone. The girl who played the dual roles as the twins was superb. Getting old, can't remember any names anymore."
5,The Parent Trap & Parent Trap II,I thought the combination movies were excellent. I saw the original Parent Trap II years ago and loved it. It was even better now. It is a movie that the whole family can watch and enjoy together.
5,I Like the Original,Still one of my favorite movies. This movie is in my collection of 'what to watch when at home sick.' Great quality.
5,The Parent Trap,Excellent! The Parent Trap (1961) is a movie that I always loved as a child. I still enjoy it very much today and am now able to share it with my family. We both love The Parent Trap II as well. Excellent Disney classics!!!
5,A Board Game of Pure Skill,"I recently discovered that ""Executive Decision"" was made available again. I have enjoyed board and card games ever since I was 8 years old, for the last 56 years. This has been my favorite board game because it leaves nothing to chance. You have to judge the business acumen and the possible irrational behavior of your opponents individually, understand that not everyone is able to or willing to calculate optimum gains and play accordingly.This is not a toy and not a game for kids. I would suggest 16-99 years. I also think that it can be used to educate your children 12 and above, to make quick calculations in their minds, without using calculators, and to be able to look through other people's eyes.You can have short or long games for a lot of fun with social and business friends. It is a game which does not require any stakes to make it more exciting.The only other game which is as exciting but which almost requires stakes is a card game called ""Gops."""
1,DOES NOT WORK,"I'm not so sure if I would trust this game. I have called ASPYR MEDIA INC (512-708-8100). They told me my new mac will not support this game &here; is nothing they can do for me. Don't trust the patch either. Hit them up and check before you waste your money.Not to rag on the game, because its pretty much my favorite."
3,Outdated Game good for older 98/2000/XP machine,This game will work with a GeForce 2 or Radeons graphic card with at least 32MB of Video memory(VRAM). That was 2002 and I bought the game used years later. Fast forward to 2011 and if you upgrade to a Vista or Windows 7 computer and the game will not work. Great to buy used for an older machine.
2,Failed to capture the spirit of bluegrass,"The book is poorly organized and in general hard to read. More than a journey into the discovery of Bluegrass it is the journal of a Bluegrass insider who can easily list the who's who rather than explain what's what. If you passion is music, this is not your book.The historical part is interesting, but fails to captivate the audience. Similar recanting of the early days on the Web are free and a lot more captivating. Naturally, as the books become more and more dated, a lot of the references provided become outdated and so, it does not even serve as a reference book.I hope not to offend the author, but I would recommend you save you money and perhaps check if your local library can get you a copy."
1,Like reading an encyclopedia article,"Two of the three reviews are obvious plants put in by friends of the author. I'm an experienced guitar player, a budding mandolin player, and wanted to dig a little deeper into bluegrass. This, unfortunately, was not the book to read. There are no interesting stories here. The photographs are the kind you would see in any family's drawer of pictures not good enough to make it into the scrapbook.I'm going to keep hunting for a good, fun read about bluegrass. If you are searching for the same thing, skip this book. This was a disappointment."
5,Beautiful but hard to find,"I heard this on the Mistubishi commercial, then I saw the music video on VH1 and ordered the CD single. There are probably a thousand different mixes of the song ""Breathe""; the original Genetic World track, the music video track, the ""Radio Edit"" on the single CD, the extended mix, the scratch massive mix, 2 other mixes on the single CD, the one I actually heard on the radio, etc. The track from the original CD has actual lyrics, not just ""just breathe"" over and over again (not that that's a bad thing). The version I heard on the radio has loud drums throughout. My favorite version is the ""Breathe Radio Edit"" on the single CD. If you just want the song you heard on the freaking commercial, get this CD. The only good songs are the first and the fifth. Still, it's worth it."
2,good pricing-shipping not so good,"Best price on internet...HOWEVER, this MUST be kept refigerated per the DVM at Vetoquil...first shipment lost then found after 8 days... 2nd arrived in 4 days...still, no longer kept cool by ice packs. Customer service is xlnt, but advise you purchase this locally or you may be giving your pet useless meds."
1,no enteric coating,"This is the 2nd time I've tried to get this posted. The first never made it.In all the reviews, no one mentioned that the azodyl is put in standard gel caps which are not enteric coated as the advertizement states. I emailed vetoquinolusa regarding this. The email response from them was ""Deleted - not read"".Enteric coating is essential to getting the probiotics to the colon with out going through the stomach digestive processes. That said, I would only dispense this on an empty stomach at least an hour before or several hours after feeding."
5,Better than 1800 petmeds!,I am glad I found this product here at Amazon!I could not afford keeping my 21 year old cat with kidney failure healthy without this product! And could not afford from the Vet....and petmeds was not much better and upon second order...wanted 20$ for shipping!! I recommend anyone needing Vet medication check Amazon FIRST!!Me and my cat are very satisfied!!re-ordering NOW!!
1,NOT KEPT COLD,"When the Azodyl arrived room temperature, when it should be cold (the ice packs were defrosted in the 2 day trip), I wrote to the company. They told me that it was still affective for 5 days. I told my vet and he said that's not true. I won't order it through that company again."
4,Azodyl - Recommended Seller,"This item came a few days later than expected but no big deal. They did come packed with cold packs which was very nice as this item should be refridgerated so they were still cool when they arrived. I would buy from this seller again without hesitation. Also, this seller had the best price for this item after an exhaustive search on the internet."
1,Azodyl,"The rating is for the shipper only. The product itself can be life-saving. Medivet needs to check their delivery dates before shipping. By the time they shipped (3-4 days after ordering), it landed in the postal services hands just in time for the weekend. Needless to say, the ice pack had long melted and product was useless. Product MUST be kept cold. If shipper chooses to ship this product, it should really be done on Mondays and Tuesdays ONLY and NOT 3-4 days after ordering."
1,EntirelyPets does not ship this correctly,"This product needs to be shipped cold. They attempted to use an ice pack but was not sufficient for the 4 days it took to be deliver.The product is helping our 13 year old lab with CRF. After a month on this product and dirt changes her bloodworm was improved. Not a solution, but helping."
4,Azydol,"I just wanted to comment on the cat owner who gives her cat Azydol after eating to ensure there is saliva to aid in swallowing. My vet stressed that I should keep Azydol refrigerated and administer first thing in am on an empty stomach, not after any food."
5,Life saver,"Our cat has kidney problems and this medicine keeps him feeling fine. It's like a probiotoc that helps the kidneys function and as long as he takes one every day, he seems to have no health problems at all! I truly believe this is a miracle for pets with kidney disease."
2,Did not help,My golden retriever was in the final stages of kidney failure and our vet and I thought Azodyl might be able to help. I could not detect any better or worse changes in his condition after using it for three weeks. Might work better with your pet.
2,Size one capsules,"Azodyl comes in size one capsules, and the best way to get it down an animal's throat is with one of the larger pillguns (search for ""bull's eye"" pillgun) and not the type of pill poppers that have the little rubber tip on the end (the capsule will generally fall off of those).My order came from Medi-Vet and arrived faster than I expected, with cold packs on the medication. I am very pleased with this vendor.Regarding the medication itself: do not expect miracles; my cat had recently-diagnosed polycystic kidney disease and only lived for a few weeks after starting the Azodyl. My vet told me not to expect miracles but I did anyway. If I had known about the kidney disease earlier, the Azodyl might have made a difference. I'm also not sure of the efficacy if your pet happens to be on antibiotics at the time, as the product is a probiotic. In that case, definitely consult your vet. It's possible taking the medications a couple of hours apart could help."
1,Do NOT buy Azodyl from Medi-Vet,"Medi-Vet authorized my credit card and confirmed the order. Three days later I received an e-mail telling me the product would probably not stay cold, please let them know how I wanted to proceed. They sent this e-mail to me hrs before they were to ship it when this notice should have come to me IMMEDIATELY when they received my order.I called immediately, but they claim to have already shipped it out. Thank God I'd only ordered one bottle to see whether Med-Vet was a reputable retailer. It should be interesting to see whether I'll be successful in getting my money back since they asked for my advice then shipped it anyway without hearing from me. Totally unacceptable and will never deal with them again."
5,Better Blood Tests,"Without this product, my 13 1/2 year old Dalmatian (Airelle)would probably be dead.She is renal failure from the Dog Food Recall problems of a year and a half ago. She lost her sister (Darion) but with this product, it seems to be keeping her going right now. Her greatin and Bun levels are within tolerable range now. Thanks for Azodyl. I am giving in conjunction with Epakitin."
5,Great product from what I observe,"My yellow lab is 12 1/2, and was diagnosed with kidney failure in October 2007. It is now almost March 2008, and she is doing so great! We are treating her with other meds as well, but I could see the difference in her when we ran out of this product for over a week! For an old lady, she sure seems to be responding to SOMETHING, and Azodyl seems to be one of them!"
4,"My 21 year old cat, Chester, has improved markedly","Azodyl was recommended by my vet. This product has really done wonders for my cat. He's much more active and pestier than ever. I'm going to start his brother, Maverick, on it after his next vet visit if the vet approves. I agree with the complaint of others that the packages have arrived warm."
1,product not handled properly-arrived warm,"Azodyl arrived WARM! This not the first time for EntirelyPets;see the review of J-D of April 23,2010."
1,Azodyl must be kept refrigerated,"I called the manufacturer to find out what happens if azodyl is not kept refrigerated. I Was told that if the product is not kept cold the live bacteria will die and the product is worthless. I will not order from amazon again, because both times I ordered it online from two different companies it arrived warm."
3,Azoydl,"The item arrived ""warm""...it contains live organisms that require cool temperatures in order to survive.I'm not sure I will order again because of this."
5,Amazing,This product is amazing. My 14 year old dog was showing signs of slight kidney failure when I started this product a year ago. She is almost 15 and still running and jumping around (literally) and her kidneys have 'maintained'. This product has given my dog a longer life. I highly recommend it.
2,"Excellent Product. But, as advertised on Amazon -- VERY MISLEADING! Product requires refridgeration and overnight shipping!!","This is a fabulous product that has aided (in conjunction with western and Chinese medicine) in helping my puppy recover from Acute Kidney Failure. However, the shipping that is quoted through Amazon is for standard shipping. This product needs to be overnighted due to the fact that it must be refrigerated. In order to request overnight shipping (which is $30) you must contact the supplier (entirelypets) directly."
1,Poor Pot,"Farberware FCP412 12-Cup Electric Percolator, Stainless Steel with Black AccentsI bought this to replace a GE (for Wal-Mart) percolator coffee pot, but it was a mistake. There is no indicator light to tell you when it's on and the short cord makes it difficult to pour the coffee. The huge basket probably holds enough coffee to brew 24 cups, but is unmarked, so you have to measure what you need before you add it. Plus when you make 12 cups, the bottom of the basket sits in the water, something I've never seen before.The old GE cost half as much, had a cover that was notched for easy insertion and removal, and had a glass tube on the outside to indicate how much coffee was left in the pot. Plus I could pour the coffee without having to put the spout into the cup, since its cord was longer.I do not recommend this product. Based upon other's reviews of its poor longevity, I probably won't have to keep it very long."
2,THEY DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USED TO,"My relatives and neighbors all used Farberware electric pots for years. My mother used a glass Pyrex percolator on top of the stove. When I grew up I knew for sure that I wanted a Farberware electric percolator. I heard everyone rave about them and I knew that my nextdoor neighbor's coffee tasted much better than my mother's. I had my own six cup Farberware percolator for about 15 years before I exchanged it for a new one -it still worked but I got married and needed a larger pot.We have had terrible luck with our new Farberware pots, which are manufactured in China. They used to be manufactured in the Bronx-and what a difference. We've had electrical cord problems-pump problems-they burn out in less that 3 years now.I would gladly pay more if they would make a product that would last. It is very frustrating to see the quality of these pots going down."
1,Do not buy this percolator,"Very shoddy product. After 2 months, handle broke off. Amazon replace defective unit. New unit, after 6 months use, no longer makes hot coffee, but warm coffee.Have used Farberware for years, no complaints before this. It's $50-$60 a pop for one of these coffee makers, but they're not worth it. When this 2nd unit finally poops out, will definitely not buy another Farberware unit. They're made by Black & Decker, so you think between the two firms they'd get it right. They haven't."
4,Perc makes better coffee than the electric coffee makers,"I like this coffee pot very much and feels it makes better coffee than the various electric coffee makers we have been using for a number of years. This 8-cup size is convenient for my husband & I (rather than the 12 cup)and it's not too heavy when filled to lift and pour. The one feature I forgot to look for and is my only disappointment, and that is the fact that there is no window or cup gauge so you can view how much is remaining in the pot."
1,Dont Buy This Product!,"I bought this coffee pot on Sept 6, 2006 for $32.95 from Amazon. It went out about a year ago, and I replaced it with an identical one I found on sale at JC Penny for $24.95. That one just went out. The part that goes bad is a $5 thermostat, and you can't get one that will replace the original. There is a thermostat available on Amazon, but it both requires some tedious modification to get it to fit and it does not last - just like the original. Now, Amazon/Faberware wants $40 for this piece of junk. No Way! I love the size for 2 people, and it makes good coffee. However, it will not last. I've had 2 of them since Sept 6, 2006, and they're both in the landfill now. It's time to try another brand!"
5,grandmom's favorite,"Every 3 years or so, I order one of these for my grandmother and her friend. Both women love it. It's small, so it's perfect for an elderly person living alone. It's reliable and makes great coffee. A good deal."
3,Perculators,"The first one we owned lasted only 26 years......that was a 12 cup.How things change when quality takes a back seat to pricing.Our original 12 cupper was made in USA.....the 3 I've purchased in the last 10 years were made in.....yup, you guessed it, China....the difference in quality is obvious to anyone who owned a USA model......if we get 3 years out of this machine I'll be happy. A sad state of affairs for Farberware......I'd rather pay $100.00 and have it made in the USA but we all know that will never happen. Unfortunately, of all the perculators on the market, this one is the ""best"".....and the reason I keep purchasing them."
1,0 for 2,I have purchased 2 of these pots in the last 16 months. The last one in Feb. They both worked great for 6 months or so then the heating units seem to fail. Only got warm tan water this morning! Same thing my last one did after about 8 months! Great pot if you only need one for 6 months. Am on Amazon looking for something that will last a little longer!
2,Farberware percolator,"I've used and enjoyed the 4 cup and 8 cup Farberware percolators for over ten years but due to a recent and potentially dangerous mishap have decided to find another coffee machine. About 3 weeks ago I plugged in my 4 cup percolator only to have it immediately spew a rocket like emission of flames into my kitchen - literally a 4 foot stream of fire! Black burning bits of plastic flew across the room. My husband saw the flames from the other room - ran in, unplugged it and threw it in the sink. I have since contacted Farberware who has sent me paid postage to return the percolator for examination. The woman on the phone could offer no explanation. Let me also add that this particular machine was not even a year old. Very scary."
1,Maybe I'm doing something wrong...,"Had the same pot for years but let water get into the base socket and it rusted out. Always enjoyed the great flavor. Bought the new one in June and by Aug it doesn't brew the coffee completely, producing a weak cup of java. Other complaints I've read echo this same problem. I tried a number of things including ice cold water even with ice chips trying to bring back the old flavor. No luck. We buy coffee ten cans at a time and tried water/coffee brands/cleaning/etc., all those combo's but just colored water as the final product. Any ideas???I'm now going to find out about warranty info....be careful...I hope it's just a defective one and not a company trying to cut corners. Miss that cup of coffee."
4,Best Coffee Pot I've owned...,"I've owned a lot of coffee makers, but after my last one's lid broke, I decided to investigate percolators. What's great about having one is that it isn't breakable, it makes delicious coffee, no filters to worry about and it's easy to keep clean. It does make some noise while it's brewing, but not anything too loud. I think because of the solid black knob on top, you don't get the old-fashioned percolator type sound. I envision owning this for many, many years. I definitely recommend buying one."
3,Isn't what it used to be,"I have had Farberware electric perks since the mid 70's. They were great.Over the past few years I believe that their quality is not to standard. If you don't unplug this pot immediately after the coffee is finished perking it actually cooks and has that burnt aroma and taste. I don't care for auto drip units, coffee never is hot enough so I am sticking with the old standby electric perc."
1,Defective,"I've always loved the taste of perked coffee but never owned a percolator. After much research I purchased the 4-8 cup farberware. It perked for 1-1/2 minutes then steamed for 4-5. The coffee flavored water was awful. Huge dissapointment. I sent it back for another...same thing. At least Amazon was a terrific return policy. I purchased a third at a department store...the same. I notice the on-line price has come down since then. Odd that the 12 cup is double the price. My guess is they're unloading the defective ones. Run, back to your drip!"
1,Don't buy this,"We love coffee and have had a very hard time replacing our old Krup. After 3-4 drip pots in the last couple of years I decided to try a percolator. I read the reviews and this one seemed ideal. I was wrong. It makes lousy coffee. We've tried different amounts, different kinds all with the same result - lousy. The instructions state you should take the basket of coffee grounds out of the percolator before you pour the first cup. I hope you have fingers of steel. It's HOT and in every pot the basket was still full of water with the grounds. Which was made worse when I tried the filters that were recommended to go with this percolator. Long story short I am returning it."
2,farberware millinimun coffee pot,"bought this through amazon,on october 18,2010,only 6 months old,the coffee is at room temperature when poured....who do i return it to? I LOST THE RECEIPT...also bought a all in one rubber broom,it broke,genesis 21 shop,they said they only sell them,they do not replace them....WHO DO I GO TO FOR HELP?"
1,DEFECTIVE,"THE TUBE THAT TAKES THE WATER UP THROUGH THE COFFEE GROUNDS DOES NOT FIT INTO THE BOTTOM HOLE OF THE POT, CONSEQUENTLY WITHOUT THAT CONNECTION, THE COFFEE CANNOT BREW."
1,Farberware 2-4 cup coffe pot,"I love my Farberware coffee pot 2-4 cups, I take it out of town with me whenever I go. It makes wonderful coffee and well worth the price... Terry"
4,Great coffee but grounds in the bottom,"This coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee. However, it leave grounds in the bottom of your cup! Not big on that if you are a bottom feeder! However, like I said makes a great cup of coffee and worth the money! You have people over? Cover's enough coffee to feed 4 with a secomd cup each! It is truly a good cup if you buy great coffee! You need to like it strong and long! It's great! Only problem is that the second cup CAN (on occassion) have that burnt taste. I still love it and will make percolated coffee every DAY!"
1,Chinese Junque,"I've had two of these during the past year year. The first one lasted about three months, and the second one just died. Both were used only once a day in the a.m. The Farberware name used to be synonymous with quality. No longer. This piece of junk has soured me on all Farberware products. Caveat emptor."
4,"This is a handy coffee pot and worth the money, but . . .","I miss the little red light that used to be there when I had one of these coffee pots a number of years ago and was lit when the pot was on. I also miss the glass cap on the top where I could see the coffee perking (don't know if that served any purpose). I recognize that those assets are from a bygone era and their removal helps keep the cost low and well worth it. The good news is that I left the coffeepot on twice all day and did not burn down the house or even burn out the pot. Just had to fill it with warm water, let it soak a while and then, with a little elbow grease, got all the gunk out. Could have been a lot worse!!All in all, this coffee pot makes a decent cup of coffee and is well worth its cost."
1,Faberware is made by Black and Decker,I was looking for a replacement for my coffee maker - the space saver by black and decker. It has MAJOR PROBLEMS! So does my Black and Decker coffee grinder. My friends suggested Faberware. But it's made by Black and Decker - and the reviews for this percolator that state broken parts and failure only strengthen my belief that ANYTHING MADE BY BLACK AND DECKER HAS CHEAP PARTS AND DOES NOT LAST. What's more Black and Decker KNOWS OF THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT CONTACT THEM DIRECTLY even if you just want to replace a part.Consensus - DO NOT BUY ANY BLACK AND DECKER PRODUCTS!
2,"works fine, but the coffee is WEAK","I've never had a perc before, but got one after years of having to microwave the tepid coffee drip coffeemakers make. I can't believe how weak the percolated coffee is. I can't add any more coffee, as there is no more room in the basket. So I will continue to search for a good, hot strong cup of coffee. It's not going to come from this machine."
2,ANTonline,"I ordered this item for work and waited and waited (nearly 3 weeks) for it to arrive. Finally, I received an email that it had been damaged in shipping and was on its way back to the warehouse. What's up with that? I would not order from this company again, and am surprised at the subpar customer service offered by this Amazon-related supplier."
1,LOW PRICE BUT LAST ONLY 18 MONTHS UNTIL COMPLETELY DEAD,Farberware FCP240 Electric Percolator STARTED TO FAIL AFTER 13-14 MONTHSAND COMPLETELY DIED AT THE BEGINNING OF MAY.
2,not up to the mark,"I was dissappointed with this product. I prefer the traditional stove top ones to this and it consumes 3 times more coffree powder than the traditional ones but gives a very light decauction. Although the process is quick, the decauction is not stronger , like in the stove top ones, which really make good coffee. Also i feel the price is too high given its performance, although it's very neat looking and all..i sent back in no time and amazon was very responsive as usual...I'm currently using a stove top one from farberware and that works best.."
1,Died after 8 months,"This was my second Farberware 4 cup coffee pot. My first one was vintage and lasted for almost 10 years. The heating element went out on it and I just decided to buy a new one. The new one is definitely not the same quality - lightweight and not a solidly built, but it makes a great cup of coffee. (Quick, easy to use, great tasting, hot, hot coffee!!!!)Within 8 months (bought it in late March and it died in November) the thing is dead. One prong came loose and then disappeared into the base, then shortly after the second prong came loose. So there was only 1 prong left to plug the cord into and of course, it doesn't heat up.My son and I attempted to ""fix"" it because I couldn't find my receipt...which I am certain would negate any warranty that I might have had.I won't buy another one."
1,Not made like they use to,"Have used farberware pot's for 20 years. Mine broke in March of 2010, it was only 2 1/2 years old. Ordered new one, has lasted 7 months and does not function properly."
2,Good While It Lasted,I purchased this item less than a year ago. It made wonderful coffee for a few months.The problom began when the heat element failed to brew hot coffee. The result was a watery substance unfit for drinking. The pot now resides as a decoration on top of my fridge. What a disappointment!
1,Very bummed:(,"Bought it for myself for Christmas, went to use it and found that the top is so tight and hard to take off I had to practically tackle it. Needless to say I knew right away I didn't want to struggle with a coffee pot and never used it. Decided to send it right back. It appears nice and sturdy, well made too, perhaps I just got a bumm one but I'm not trying another."
4,Faberware Coffee Pot,"This was a replacement coffee pot of the same kind; however, this one wouldn't plug into the outlet without tripping the electricity. I had to get an adapter to make it work. My old Farberware pot didn't need it so I don't know what was wrong."
4,Brews fast and hot Made in China,Have owned this coffee pot for about a month. So far it's performing as advertised...brews very quickly. Coffee is hot and tastes decent. It sounds like the space shuttle is being launched when you first start it. My cat runs away when he hears it perking. LOLI am disappointed to see that Farberware crapped out and is manufacturing in China. The craftsmanship is obviously inferior to the percolator I owned for 20 years. The previous one was made in USA. It's sad that I'm already anticipating this Chinese perker to die within a year or so.
3,"It Looks Nice, But The Coffee Lacks Taste","My morning cup of coffee is 12 ounces of Cafe Oquendo Espresso brewed in a stovetop Bialetti stainless moka pot. I bought the percolator for a touch of nostalgia. The water doesn't get hot enough to extract the real flavor of the coffee. My Zia Francesca (everyone calls her Frannie) likes her coffee to look like tea. She would love this Farberware Percolator. It's okay, if you like Folgers or Maxwell House or Butternut, but if you're kinda like me and enjoy a good kick-in-the-pants espresso brew in the morning, this perker ain't for you. Capisca?"
5,farberware electric coffe pot - 8 cups,"Excellent product. Basically, the only coffee percolator we are happy with. Amazon's service and delivery was perfect."
1,Another piece of Junk,"Im saddened, yes saddened, to have to write this review. Easy to use, makes good coffee, BUT what but ""junk"" can you call a $40 appliance that lasts less than 4 months. I've been using these for many years and expected and accepted that after a couple of years of daily use it would need to be replaced. Then a couple of years became a year; a year became less than a year. This last one lasted 3.5 months. It's almost cheaper to go out for coffee at this point. So alas, this is my last one. Time to move on. What a shame."
5,coffee pot,"This pot makes a great cup of coffee, it is fast,it stays hot, uses less coffee grounds. Every time i try a different coffee pot, I always end up throwing it out and buying another farberware percolator. Where it's always a great cup of coffee."
2,Gets WAY too hot!,"I bought this coffee maker to save counter space. It is quite small, and it does make coffee, but it heats up the coffee way too hot and gives it a burned taste. It helps a little to use refrigerated water, and to unplug it immediately after it finishes brewing, but it still burns the coffee and stays ridiculously hot for a long time after it's unplugged. I wish I had bought the stovetop version and not sacrificed quality for convenience."
2,Didn't last very long,"I bought this coffee pot about a year ago and only used it occasionally. The last time I tried to use it the part where you plug the cord into the base of the coffee pot collapsed, making the pot unusable. I thought I was getting a quality coffee pot that would last for years, like my old Farberware percolator did, but apparently they are not made as well as they used to be."
5,Piping Hot Coffe,"I always preferred perked coffee over drip coffee. I have a 4-cup Farberware that I love, but needed a bigger capacity pot. This percolator does the trick. Farberware has always been a good product. The only thing I can find wrong is the cord, could be a bit longer. I highly recommend this product and would buy another without hesitation. Check it out:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004R946/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
4,Faberware 12-cup Percolator,I love this coffee pot it is much lighter than the one that broke on me after many many years of use. I would definitly but another!
4,Home Roaster review Farberware 4-cup,"Makes great coffee and totally eliminates that plastic smell and taste of the conventional drip coffee makers. One big difference, brews 4 cups at about 1 cup/minute and the final coffee is very hot. Much hotter than your typical drip maker. (I need to wait a little while to start drinking the coffee) If you don't use a paper filter, expect a little sediment from the grounds.Great maker,BobM"
3,Not so good,"I like the coffee that this pot makes very much, however, what on earth did they put that awful cord with it. It is hard to fit on and practically impossible to get out of the socket to wash the pot. They should have stuck with the older thinner cord with the easy in and out plug. Otherwise, received the pot quickly, just not happy when making it with the thick cords."
3,Don't get ur perks up to high.,i would not recommend this product. It worked a couple of weeks. The cord was kidda hard to remove for cleaning. i hate wasting money.
5,love this coffee pot,I have been using these coffee pots for years now. Have tried other coffee makers and always go back to the farberware. Will continue to use this product for its durability and design.
4,A,Bought for my mother. She loves it. It makes just enough coffee for her. She likes the old perk style.
5,Farberware Stailes Steal Percolator,"I have had several of these coffee pots over the years and love them. They are easy to travel with, make coffee very fast. I have one set up by the night table so just plug it in in the morning and the coffee is made in a jiffy and one for traveling."
4,Great Coffee!,"This is the fourh Farberware coffee pot I have bought. It is far superior to any other electric pot I've ever used, the coffee is always excellent and VERY hot. The only problem is that after two, three years it stops working efficiently and needs to be replaced. Maybe I will be lucky this time and it will last longer, therefore the four stars."
2,Great Coffee for 1 year only,"I bought the Farberware 8-cupe percolator on the strength of Amazon customer reviews and enjoyed piping hot, delicious coffee for about a year. Then, the percolator began to deliver only a lukewarm and very weak brew. I am trying to decide whether I should try another brand of percolator or return to my French press."
5,BRUCE BENNETT,THE FARBERWARE COFFEE POT IS AN EXCEPTIONAL VALUE WE ARE VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PURCHASE.
3,Terrible plug,"The plug going to the pot stinks, when you pick up the pot to pour a cup the plug becomes disengaged and if you don't keep pushing it back in, the coffee gets cold. Whoever designed that plug should have their head examined. Why mess with a good thing like the one you had? I have been using Farberware percolators for many years and this is the first one I with which I am not completely satisfied."
5,Great coffee!,This percolator is a smaller version so it's perfect for me. I brew Starbucks Breakfast Blend and it is delicious. Percolated coffee reminds me of how my grandmother made coffee on the stovetop. I just don't think you get the flavor of the coffee when it drips through an automatic coffeemaker so quickly. The Farberware product brews delicious coffee. The only drawback to percolators (any brand) is the cleanup....several parts to wash and coffee grounds to deal with----worth it to me.
4,Good coffeepot,Farberware is always a reliable coffeepot. No issues with it but I wish it had a clear glass top instead of the black top.
5,Love It!,I Love this coffee pot. It is a good size for a few friends getting together for a cup of coffee or tea (go through a cycle without putting coffee grinds in). This was to replace our old pot which I burned out by plugging it in and forgetting to add water! Not a good idea!!!
4,"Good, hot coffee!","I borrowed my son's Farberware FCP280 8-cup percolator, for a couple of weeks, to see how I would like it. I have used a Corning Ware coffee pot for decades, scrounging parts and the pot itself, in thrift stores, as it is not manufactured anymore. I tried electric drip-pots but was not satisfied. The coffee never was hot enough. Low and behold! My son's pot made wonderful, hot coffee, and kept it at that hot temperature throughought my breakfast.I would highly recommend this coffee pot to my friends, and have. The coffee turns out perfectly, and I now do not have to keep an eye on the coffee percolating on the kitchen stove top to make sure it doesn't over-flow. I can start the coffee, go out and pick up my daily papers, and sometimes get caught by a neighbor and know that the coffee pot will turn down itself, without my attention.Coffee lovers, awake. This Farberware FCP280-8 cup is wonderful. I just wish the electric cord was a little longer."
1,Less than impressed,I was extremely disappointed with this purchase.....the entire workings to actually make coffee were not in the box when I gave it as a gift.....I had to contact the vendor.....very time consuming btw....to get the missing parts which took ten days to come in....what a waste
4,Nice alternative,"My only complaint is ""if"" the grounds are too small they fall through the basket. Otherwise makes great coffee!"
4,Two 8 oz cups are not enough for this house,"so I'll return this for a larger percolator. That being said, this thing makes a nice, strong, quick cup of coffee and that coffee is HOT.My only complaint: its cord is shorter than heck, so I had to get a power bar in order to plug it in behind my rolling stainless steel kitchen cart.My recommendation to you, if you're disliking your automatic coffee makers: try this product. I had two Mr. Coffees and a Krups, and this simple device makes a great cup of hot coffee!"
1,Lasted a month - Avoid,"The handle is attached with tiny spot welds. It broke off in less than a month. The design is inappropriate for, well, actual use.As for the coffee, it was great. Not plasticy. Hot. For a month, it was great."
5,Beautiful Sound in the a.m.,"The sound of perking coffee is a promise of an exquisite cup of coffee, and the Farberware I purchased makes it all easy. It is very fast, produces 8 cups of smooth, mellow coffee and is easy to clean. Looks great on the countertop too - never thought a coffee pot could be so stylish, but this one is. It is very solidly constructed, and while some folks in the reviews recommended using filters, I haven't used them and personally don't see a need to.There's a little touchiness in the plug-in/percolate start up. I've managed to overcome it by being a little careful to make sure she is plugged in tightly on both ends.I did quite a bit of research and asked around before I purchased, and I certainly would recommend this product. Many happy mornings to you!"
5,house wife,Have an older 2-4 cup percolator that's about 35 years old and still works good but decided to get a new one and very happy with it.
2,cold coffee,"didn't last long, sometimes didn't perk the coffee and most of the time it is just lukewarm coffee. NOT the HOT coffee it gave the first 3 months."
4,Too Hot to Handle,"This pot is great if you like percolated coffee. But, take the coffee chamber out immediately after it is finished brewing. Rather than a warming coil, this pot re-percolates the coffee to keep it hot. Leaving the coffee chamber in will make for a very strong second cup.Other than that, this little pot is perfect for that afternoon or after dinner cup."
4,After 10 years buying it again...,"The Farberware pot brings the sound and aroma of morning to our kitchen. It has religiously given us 10 wonderful years of ""8 cups in 8 minutes"" with a perfect cup each time. Our water is hard and our experience with a very good brand drip coffee maker was constant problems with scale. This pot is simple to clean and here is the best way to do it: add a tablespoon of automatic dishwashing soap (we use Cascade) to a full pot of just water - PERK and REPEAT (gently scrubbing the inner surface after each perking). Your pot will sparkle like new!"
4,Faberware 12 cup perculator,"The coffee pot is great altho I felt that it was used previously, as when I washed it the first time I got a trace of coffee grounds."
3,"Makes great coffee, dies too soon...","I went through 3 of these percolators in about 6 years. I love the coffee this percolator makes, and I grew up drinking coffee from a Farberware percolator. That's why I kept buying them after they died on me after a short span of normal (once a day) use. My mother recently replaced the Farberware percolator she had for years and years, and the newer one didn't last too long for her either. I don't know what's different, but I finally broke down and bought a Cuisinart coffee machine -- got tired of replacing those Farberwares..."
2,Wouldn't recommend.,"This works great. It's stainless steel, which is a plus. But the coffee does not taste very good. The same coffee beans ground for a drip coffee maker taste remarkably better. This makes great coffee beans taste like coffee store generic beans. Also, it take twice as much coffee to make an equal amount of coffee. So, over the long term, it's more expensive to use."
3,Farberware Percolator,The aluminum parts stain quickly and thoroughly. The socket to insert the plug should have a slight upward tilt to make insertion easier.But not a bad overall design.Norman
5,pot of joe,This coffee pot is superfast and makes excellent coffee. It is easy to clean. The pot is worth every penney of the cost of it. If you have never had a farberware coffee pot you are in for a treat!
4,Hot with great taste,"I got tired of drip coffeemakers always breaking down and remembered how much I loved my old electric percolator. This one does not fail to please me. Hot coffee, quick perk. No issues."
2,not like mother had!,"I had this coffee pot for two years. After 6 months the knob on top fell off. I tried and tried to contact some one, no response. SO...I put a piece of duct tape on the lid so the coffee would not spurt out....yes, very inventive. Still made a fairly good cup of coffee. Now barely two years later the pot does not work at all. It is out of warranty, (btw....Black and Decker handle all Farberware now) so the pot must be replaced. I will not be getting a Farberware, sad to say. My mom AND mother in-law both had Farberware coffee makers...had them for years. They WERE a great coffee maker. Maybe I just got a ""lemon"". They are not inexpensive and would hope to have it longer than two years. So beware....the product does not always live up to its name."
1,Lasted till warranty over,"I purchased 4 cup Farberware percolator and was thrilled with speed and very hot coffee. This morning it could not work. I found the prongs in the plug were just hanging loose and would not make contact. In checking further, they were all just the same.I am VERY unhappy as the warranty has expired and they ask you to send it to Illinois for ""replacement or repair"" which would cost considerable.Farberware is no longer MADE IN AMERICA. Another out sourced company."
4,cute little pot,"I love the coffee that this pot makes. There is nothing like perked coffee.The coffee is piping hot, unlike drip machines. It doesn't have any indication when the coffee is finished perking. My larger,30 year old one does and still works fine."
4,Great... except for the lid,"These days I have a great mistrust for anything plastic that is heated in anyway so I wanted a metal pot. I'm low consumption coffee drinker but it tastes good to me. What I do have a beef with is the lid design. It's SO TIGHT! I literally have to fight with it to get it off. When I do yank it off, I'm lucky that the basket doesn't come flying out!! I do frequently get coffee splatter on my counter as a result. That's why I only gave it 4 stars. Other than that, it works well."
5,Best/hottest coffee!!,"This coffeepot makes the hottest cup of coffee that I have ever had! I was sick of all of those Mr. Coffee type coffee makers that made lukewarm coffee - this pot solved my problem! I am the only coffee drinker in my house, so the size is perfect."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"Purchased this product in Nov 2011, May25 2012 quit working completely I got six month use out of it. Very disapointed after all the great reviews. Rc"
2,Weak Handle,"OverallWhile he coffee pot makes good coffee and has nice capacity, the poor quality materials, wasteful return policy (a cracked handle--held on by two screws--essentially requires throwing away the entire pot), and poor customer service significantly lower the rating for this otherwise good unit.Negatives-- Weak handle (two cracked at same place within four month with once-a-day use)-- Handle apparently not replaceable (instead, requires warranty return at owner expense of cord (yes, cord)cut in half and proof of purchase)-- Hard to clean (narrow top makes internal cleaning hard and cannot immerse in water for outside cleaning)Positives-- Makes good coffee-- No filters to purchase-- Nice stainless steel basket-- Easy morning assembly-- All stainless steel internal parts"
3,it's ok,"i like that i dont have to use filter. it is a loud little guy and cleaning is not as convenient as just changing a paper filter. its an ok product. also be sure to pay attention to the return policy as Amazon only allows 30 day. but if you really like this product and something goes wrong after the 30 days, contact the manufacturer, they replaced one for my sister at no charge."
2,Went through two of these pots in less than two years,"Makes great coffee, when it works. Was pleased when we first received our perculator - makes great coffee. After about 6 months it started acting up; perking for a couple of minutes and that was it. I contacted Faberware and they sent replacement parts - which didn't work. They then had us cut the cord and send them the piece of cord. They replaced the pot (to their credit), however the new pot quit after about the same amount of time. Love perked coffee, but done with Faberware."
2,Farberware electric percolator,"This product has definitely lost its quality. We had a Farberware percolator that lasted 15 years. It finally quit and we bought a new one expecting the same quality. The new one lasted less than 18 months. Customer service department was not helpful. It makes great coffee. But considering its cost and short life span, it's not worth it. I will not buy a Farberware electric percolator again."
1,Quality has dropped,"I have an original Farberware Superfast from 1976. It still works!I saw these in the store at Kitchen Collection and I had to buy a new one, and store the old one since it was my late mother's coffee pot.I purchased a 12cup and an 8cup maker.I haven't used the 12 cup one yet, but I've been using the 8 cup every day since Aug 2011.The thermostat has already crapped out.It starts the brew cycle and stops halfway through, leaving me with a pot of very weak coffee.Its only 5 months old!Obviously, the new thermostats are not built with the same quality as the old ones.It's sad, since that is the most important part of the coffee maker.I'm trying to get an exchange but it is past 90 days.I'm so far very disappointed in the quality of the thermostat in these new makers.Beware!"
1,Farberware makes junk,"These coffee pots used to be manufactured like tanks. They worked forever and now they work 4-6 months if you're lucky. Trying to contact the manufacturer is a joke. Their customer service telephone line won't answer, the email bounced back. You can go to a horrible website that claims to sell parts - but it is such a shoddy website it is unbelievable. Here's a list of their companies you should avoid buying products from Farberware, black and decker, juiceman, breadman, Russell hobbs, toastmaster, George Foreman, Litter maid, sonic web (whatever that is) and clear2-0. This is a horrible company that puts out garbage products.Update - someone finally answered the customer service line in India and they told me (NOW GET THIS) they no longer make the power cord for a coffee pot I bought 2 months ago from Bed, Bath and Beyond. I'm going to complain to Bed,Bath and Beyond for working with such a horrible manufacturer."
1,Rust spots inside pot,I found spots down inside the rim of this coffee pot which is rust. I haven't had the pot but a month. I'm disappointed and the coffee is not tasting good. It must not be all stainless steel. I paid way too much for a rusty pot.
1,Farberware coffee pot,"Had the pot a few months , it stopped working. Was given a hard time at Farberware trying to return it."
1,"Farberware FCP412 12 cup Percolator, Stainless Steel","I only used it for 3 months and it wouldn't keep the coffee hot, let alone warm. I won't buy another one."
2,Poor Quality,"The old Farberware percolators used to last a minimum of 10 years if not 20. However, their production quality has dropped dramatically, and so now you are lucky to get three years out of them. My most recent one just died after less than 3 years of use. It looks pretty and the stainless steal is of a good quality, but the electronics don't last. I am in a market for a new one now because this product broke and I guess it is time to try a new brand. I am tired of having to buy a new percolator every few years."
4,Farberware 8 cup percolator,"I received my coffee pot a few days before the estimated delivery date. It was as expected, I've had Farberware products in the past. I have to say I'd forgotten what HOT coffee was like and I'm very happy that this pot does serve a hot cup of coffee. Even in the warming stage it's hotter than my last pot.There is one thing I don't care for though, the way the lid is secured to the pot. I feel as though I'm going to pull the handle off the lid. It's a secure lid but find it to be hard to remove it.Overall I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,"Great Coffee, But...","I had forgotten how much better percolated coffee tastes compared to drip. Even after sitting in the pot for an hour, the coffee still tastes fresh. After an hour in the drip coffee makers, the coffee was bitter and murky. Not so with the percolator. We use less coffee per pot and less is dumped out due to being old. This pot takes up much less space on the counter, too.We have only been using this 8-cup percolator for a little over a week, so I can't write about the longevity. The only reason I didn't order the 12-cup programmable one is because of all the reviews saying it quits working after a few months. I am hoping this one holds up better. Even if it does konk out after a few months, I'll still buy another percolator.Added: It konked out after 6 months. Back to the drawing board."
4,HOT Coffee --- FAST!,"I lost one of the parts to my original Farberware Super Fast percolator, which was about 35 years old. So, when I saw this great deal on Amazon, I decided to replace the old one. The new percolator looks almost identical and it does indeed make really great tasting hot coffee ""super fast"". The 4 cup size is perfect for those mornings when it's just me who will be drinking coffee. My only ""complaint"" is that the inside parts (stem and basket) don't seem quite as sturdy as the ones from my old unit. Overall, I think it's a very good product and I love the fact that the appearance has remained the same."
2,Disappointed With Design Changes,"When the Farberware FCP280 8-cup Percolator I purchased just a year ago started making warm (rather than hot) coffee, I purchased a new one. I didn't hesitate because this percolator has consistently made a wonderfully rich cup of coffee. Over the past year the spout has been redesigned and now annoyingly spurts, splashes and dribbles coffee all around the cup as I pour. A shortening of the basket stem has effected a shifting of the grounds basket while pouring that makes the pot feel unbalanced, heavy and awkward. Please, Farberware Engineers, may we have our old design back! It was perfect. My new pot is in the trash."
1,Farberware not what they use to be,Bought 8 cup percolator from Amazon. Lasted 5 days and stopped working. My old one was in use for 20 years. The new one the metal is about half as thick. When the coffee pot came the the coffee was wonderful.Don't know if these are made in China or what. They had better improve quality or go out of business.
1,WONT LAST AND ONLY ONE YEAR WARRANTY,"I have purchased two of these percolators in the last three years. One to replace the other due the warranty being expired. Both stopped working shortly after the warranty. The first did not keep coffee hot and the second one did not work at all after a year or so, also heating problem. Prior coffee percolator from Farber purchased in the 80's, way back when, lasted many years so I purchased two again......both have been disappointing. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I am going to try a different brand. Too bad because I did like the way the coffee came out when it did work!"
1,It broke after 3 1/2 months and it can't be returned.,"Our previous Farberware coffeemaker lasted over 4 years. This one lasted 3 1/2 months. Yesterday morning, one of the prongs in the base broke off, making the pot unusable.There was a time when Farberware sold high-quality products. Sadly, those days are apparently gone. This Chinese-made percolator is garbage.J&R; Music World gives a 30-day guarantee. Farberware gives one year and has not responded after several attempts."
1,Don't buy a Farberware FCP280!!!!!!,"On Sept. 3rd I made this purchase. Sometime it worked and sometime it did not! I returned it to Applica Consumer Products on Oct 12th. I am still waiting for a replacement because, ""It is on backorder."" Today, 11/23, I called for the sixth time. I received the same story.They're coming in in a week. When I asked how do I get a refund, I was told they don't make refunds. You don't need the aggravation. Go to a store and buy it. If it doesn't work, you can take it back and get your money!!Joan Kmiecik"
1,Broke in Two Weeks,"Brought the Farberware 8-Cup Percolator in September,2009 and it lasted for only two weeks. They are sending me a replacement, but I am without a coffee maker until it comes. Their products today are not the same quality as the older Farbware products."
1,buyers beware,"I loved my farberware coffee pots. The old adage ""They don't make 'em like they used to"" could not be truer in this case. The pot made cold, lousy coffee. I returned it after 2 tries."
1,No longer a Farberware customer,I got 20 years out of my first Farberware 12 cup percolator. I didn't want to believe the reviews I read elsewhere that they have been cheapened to the point of not being worth buying - but they were right. The one I purchased new less than 2 years ago has stopped working.
1,Cheap Made in China,"It worked well until it was accidentally submerged in water. After that it stopped working, so instead of coffee I am eating my cinnamon rolls with a coke.I was able to take the bottom off and dry it out. Its working again, but I now just rinse out the pot."
2,Not as good as everyone else described,"I bought this percolator because I read all these great feedbacks from the previous customers. However, my opinion is very different from others. I was not born in the U.S., so I am really not used to American style of water-down coffee at all. I like my coffe bold and full of aroma. This machine, however, does not provide these elements at all! Worse, the coffee made from this percolator can not even compare to dripped coffee. At least, in dripped coffe, I can still taste some coffee flavor. All I got from this percolator, is black-pigmented hot water. I am disappointed of this percolater, but it's a good water kettle, so I gave it 2 stars."
1,disappointing coffee,"First, my spreader lid didn't fit properly. The company sent me a new pot (no charge to me). Now, I am just not happy with the coffee that it brews. Too muddy. I am going back to my drip pot."
3,stop perking,"I guess the general opinion is they don't make things like they use to. I have had to purchase 2 12-c percoators in the last year for the same problem. They start perking and after 3 minutes they stop, eventhough I make sure the disc on the stem is loose when I plug it in. Because of this problem, I will not buy another Farberware. Has anyone experienced this same problem?"
1,Not What It Used To Be.,"My first farberware coffee maker lasted about 25 years - great product. The second one lasted about 10 years - not bad. The third one lasted less than three years. In an attempt to contact the company directly, I have had no response. The product cannot be repaired and this must be the company plan to sell more coffee makers. Stay away from this product. Now if I could find someone who makes a quality percolator."
1,Disappointment about Faberware Products,"Hello,I am writing to you about a Farberware product # FCP240 2-4 Cup percolator I purchase July of 2011, that is not working any more.I would also like to let you know that I have a 2-8 cup perc. Model # 138-TZ serial # 1513998, and have a 2-12 electric coffemaker Model V-R 142B . these coffee pots I received as a Wedding present in 1961 Yes 50 years ago , I use them constanly and they are both working well.The only difference the two I received as a wedding present were made in the USA. And the one I purchased last year waas made in China.I think this country needs to bring back products that are made in the Usa.ThankyouPatricia Cullitypo Box 663Pembroke, Ma 02359"
3,Perculator coffeepot,"This is the third one we've purchased, not because it's perfect, because it isn't, but because there isn't much of a choice in this type of coffeepot. It comes with a one year warranty, but it must have some kind of a timer that makes the coffeepot crash at about 18 mmonths of use. No reason, it just quits brewing. The water boils, but when you pour, you get only clear water and there is nothing to do but throw the unit away. As I said, this is number 3 which is used daily, had it about a year and we won't be surprised when this once goes the way of the others. We'll probably purchase another, but we won't be happy about it."
2,Erratically makes weak coffee after 1 year's use,"Used to be great. Now, for reasons I don't know, makes weak ""coffee water"" after 'percolating'. Some of the grounds are still dry."
5,Not a Cheaply Made Toy & Great Coffee,"I really wanted to get away from the plastic drip coffee makers. After reading the reviews here, I settled on this model. For the discounted price and free shipping, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it was made. Solid construction and all parts are heavy duty. I soak my basket and spreader before adding coffee(absolutely no grounds in coffee!) and in minutes I was drinking the best cup of coffee I've had in years!After continued use I found it best to carefully remove the basket and stem when percolation is finished."
2,Disappointed,Very noisy and takes too long to brew. Boxed it up to return but I misplaced the packing slip. Will keep using mom's very old Corelle electric percolator.
1,I thank you all,I had two Cusinart drip makers from Sams club bot go bad in the first year due to faulty sensor.150$ wasted.It seems that all these manufacturers are getting or making in China from low quality parts.So I thank all of you for letting me know that this is also going on with perc pots to.I'm going to buy a stove top perk with no electronics.
2,FARBERWARE FCB240 2-4 CUP PERCOLATOR,PERC'S GREAT... (BUT)... IT BOILS ALL OVER THE COUNTER AND HARDLY NO COFFEE IS LEFT IN POT... SHAME ON U FARBERWARE!!!
2,this WAS making great coffee until.....it shorted out,"When i researched (apparently not well enough), and got this 2-4 cup Farberware perc, i couldn't have been happier...after using a mr coffee, this coffee was HOT, and delicious and didn't take long....a couple months ago, it blew the GFI plug, and i thought it was someone else's a/c or something...well, it did it three days in a row this week....it no longer works, cuts off before it's done, blows the circuit and therefore, brown water...i'm so disappointed...and now, 20-20 hindsight, i'm reading the one star and two star reviews and see that this is a common element (no pun intended)..amazon, stop selling this piece of crap, please...i love to order everything from you, and always look to amazon first, but this is such a widespread issue with farberware, you should give them the boot..thanks"
3,disappointed,The coffee pot performed the way Farberware always has...perfectly. The problem was the cover for the pot was so tight it was almost impossible for a woman to remove. It should have been checked before being shipped.
5,great coffeepot,"You can't make better coffee than with a farberware percolator pot. My friends ask what my secret is and i say"" farberware coffee pot and Chase and Sanborn coffee!!!"""
1,This product is a disaster,"I purchased this item 2 weeks ago and have had problems with the lid since day one..It is so tight I inevitably have a mess while taking out the basket and other parts of the coffeemaker. This morning I struggled with the lid again, and it ended up burning my arm and hand as the basket flew out and coffee grounds stained my robe and ended up all over my counter and floor..I have two blisters as a result and a burned arm. I have tried to email Farberware but for some reason the address [...] is not a valid??? address..I'm now afraid to use it..I thought maybe with use the lid would loosen up eventually but I'm not going to take the chance of this happening again.."
3,"Great coffee, not durable","We use our perc everyday, & makes great tasting coffee. Only problem is we've been through three in the last couple years. Seems like the heating element or thermostat burns out after a couple months. Hate coffee-maker taste and won't go back, so considering a stovetop model because of this. Would buy if looking for infrequent use."
3,A LITTLE TO SMALL,WORKS WELL BUT THE LID IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE WITH THE SMALL KNOB ON TOP. SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED THE NEXT SIZE UP.
1,Lid is too thight,"After years of usingFarberware FCP240 2-4-Cup Percolator, Stainless SteelThis is the first time I had a problem with one. The lid is to Tight. You need one person to hold the pot and another person to pull it off. Try that when the pot is hot. Went to Macy's All the same. Don't' throw away the old lid if you replacing the pot. Don't buy it if you don't have a old lid you won't be able to use it. Sorry Faberware it was a good product"
2,farberware 12 cup coffee pot,"this is the second Farberware coffee pot I bought in the past 3 years, I had the one before these fro over 20 years, Next time I need a new pot I will try a diffrent brand."
2,Not what it used to be,"I've been brewing coffee in Farberware percolators for over 40 years. Used to be the best coffee pot in the world, in our opinion. NO MORE! The last two (2-4 cup models) died out within a year. I purchased this coffee pot in April, 2010.Worked fine for two months. Got back from vacation, now, the coffee brewing cycle starts and stops half way through leaving just a watery brew. Got a new cord thinking that was the problem, it wasn't. Obviously, the quality of these percs is gone! Only got a good cup of coffee for 3 months. I will not waste any more money on these. Very disappointed."
3,Great and Poor at the same time.,"This electric percolator makes consistently fine coffee over and over again.However, the electric cord is much too short and the inner electrics fail in about 1 year of use. Shame on Farberware for foisting such blatant planned obsolescence upon us. CHJ"
3,8 cup Faberware coffee Pot,"I was satisfied with prompt delivery of coffee pot, and appreciate it keeping coffee hot. However, I don't understand the noise it produces while percolating. Annoying!MarthaSwenson"
5,Great coffee for me!,This it my 3 farberware coffee pot. I also gave one to a friend for a gift. It broke a coupe of months ago and he has looked for another small one. It was just right for him. Keep making them.
4,good for 2-3 cups.,"I used this for making 2 large cups and it is quick to perk. I also try to use it for 1 large cup (12 oz. and I find that it does not perk enough. I tried adding more coffee, but that gets to be expensive and shouldn't. it should have a timer of how long you want it to perk.That would solve my problem. I do recommend this for someone who want to get 3 cups of very hot coffee."
3,"Product is a cheep Chinese knock-off of Farberware's original product, but it does work.","The general construction of this ""newly"" designed product has all the evidence of it having been constructed as a ""throwaway when broken"" product, that is, unrepairable. Perhaps this is what some folks want but I liked my original percolator which was repairable but which the ""distributor"" (Black & Decker?) no longer chooses to do. Ok. We bought it and it will be interesting to see how long it lasts and perhaps prove me wrong as to how I see the constructiion of this product."
4,My Wife loves it (I did get it for her),My Wife asked for a percolator for Christmas and so far she loves the coffee it makes. She has for gotten to unplug it a few times but seams safe enough. It is kind of hard to clean out the baked on coffee but it comes apart.
2,Disappointed,"This is the third Farberware 4-12 cup maker I've had, and all have had the same problem. They make great coffee for about 6 months, then seem to lose their ""oomph"" -- resulting in weak, watery coffee."
3,Farberware Percolator,"I have been using Faberware Percolators for several years and this is the worst one I have ever gotten. I think it was used, and passed off as new and I am very unhappy with it."
2,Good Coffee - Does NOT last long,"This is the THIRD one of these that I have gotten - shame on me. First one lasted years, second lasted one year - third one lasted 6 months. Failure is the pump --- item cycles and completes, but the coffee comes out like water. Can recycle the water on my own - but what's the point of that?Sorry - burned too many times on this. Although the coffee is great in the beginning - not worth the price. Back to the drip makers......"
4,4 cup percolator,Good little coffee pot. Heats quickly and makes good tasting coffee. After years of dripmakers this little pot makes the HOTTEST coffee I ever imagined. Gotta be careful with it that's for sure. Good pot fast shipping.
2,Just missed it's second birthday,"I've had this percolator for 2 years and it's been largely a disappointment. 2 issues over time.The first was the quality of the coffee. Over time I noticed that the coffee was becoming weaker. This was most evident by the color as I would add creme. I battled this by adding more grinds. Not sure if that helped immensely, but it made me feel better.The second was that the base with the heating element became somewhat warped and was not meeting the body of the pot cleanly. This was leading to water getting into the element despite my best effort during cleaning.Then last night, it up and died after just short of 2 years. Last night was December 23rd. That meant I had to go buy a new coffee pot on Xmas Eve in absolutely horrible driving coniditions. I picked up a Presto 2811 this morning. It got very good reviews here so I thought I'd give it a chance. Keeping my fingers crossed. Happy Holidays!"
1,Junk!,I have purchased 3 of them for my mother over the last several months and the last one from this site. They stop working in the matter of 3 weeks. I will NEVER buy another Farberware electric percolator again.
2,This percolator is awful!,"I bought this percolator a few weeks ago, I've used it a total of three times and it never worked right.It makes the coffee okay, but it doesn't turn off like it should and the second time I used it it cycled twice!I don't know where this percolator was made but the quality is cheap. I have an old one from my mother-in-law and that one is 100% better. I don't have the box so I cannot return it, but next time I'll make sure it was made in the good ole U.S of A! I gave it two stars because the coffee still tastes good, but since I have to unplug it right away the the coffee gets cold it isn't worth the money."
4,Lid stuck,"Coffee is great in this perk; my only complaint is the lid is difficult to remove, and when hot, you have to maneuver it in a way so you don't get fingers singed. It is recommended to remove the basket after brewing, and that is no easy task when hot. I like the way it keeps coffee hot without burning. About as messy as a press to clean. Do think we are getting a 12 cup in this brand, as the 8 cup doesn't make enough for 4 cups of coffee in our 9 ounce coffee cups."
2,Dissappointed,I had the same exact coffee pot in the past which lasted more than 10 years. I loved it because the coffee was always very hot unlike the drip pots I have had. I decided to buy another one last year and it worked great for about a year and shortly after that the coffee was no longer hot but more lukewarm. Unfortunatly it was just past the 1 year warranty so there was nothing I could do. I will not be buying another one.
4,great coffee,"We take this traveling - hate those little drip ones in the Hotel rooms... Like a cup of good coffee, in the am's... djh"
1,I Thought Faberware Was A Solid Product,I purchased a Faberware 4 cup percolator for my daughter-in-law for Mother's Day this past May. She had it for about 4 weeks when the handle just fell off the coffee pot. The handle is held on by 4 prongs that fell off. The pot fell to the floor spilling hot coffee everyware. Good thing my grandson was not crawling around the kitchen floor at the time. I recently sent the pot back to the Amazon return center in Kentucky. I am waiting to hear from them. I am very disappointed to know that this happened to a Faberware coffee pot. I have owned one for many years and the product has always been reliable and strong. I'm wondering if this product is made in America? I hope this never happens to anyone else who buys a Faberware coffee pot.
1,Disappointing,"This FCP280 lasted slightly over two years. Like many others on this list, the thermostat failed. There are no replacement parts for this model. Be aware that if you buy this model you are basically purchasing a stainless steel urn. I won't get fooled again."
4,Farberware perculator coffee pot,Worlds better than the drip Mr Coffee it replaced. Coffee is much hotter and better tasting using less coffee too.
5,Great Coffee,This coffee pot is just as promised. It makes great coffee fast and the best is that it keeps it at serving temperature with a burnt taste. I bought this to use in our motorhome as it takes up little space but bring it in the house to use because the coffee is excellent when made in this pot.
3,Broke After 3 1/2 Years,"The Farberware percolator worked fine for a while, then a few days ago without warning it stopped working. It was only used occasionally, once or twice a week. All of a sudden it stopped heating the water. It's made in China, but I can't say whether this has any bearing on the quality of the product. I'm just disappointed that this little percolator, which was handled with care, didn't last longer. Because of lack of durability, I cannot give more than 3 stars."
2,Farberware coffee pot . Model FCP412 12 cup Perculator,Farberware coffee pot cord too short. Metal construction of coffee pot made of flimsy thin metal construction. Functionally okay. Pot not designed toolast long.Coffee pot not stainless steel metal. The metal used is sprayed with stainless steel. Not worth it if you are looking for a percolator pot tolast
1,Don't buy this!!!,"I bought Farberware because of my previous experience with them. I received a Farberware percolator as a wedding gift. It lasted over 50 years. The new one I bought has lasted 15 months and no repair service, no parts service. They offered to sell me a new one. Unless you find an older model that was made in the USA - forget it."
2,Don't Waste your money,"HAVE USED Faberware coffee makers for years.They were once built in the bronx USA,now in china.The overall quality has gone down.Buy yours at one of the retails that takes back any product(kohls,bed bath and beyond,target,pch, if it breaks. Save your receipt and get your money back or replacement.That's what i did."
2,Disappointed,Farberware products are not living up to their reputation. This is my second 2-4 cup percolator. The previous pot gave me several severe shocks. The replacement percolator only lasted 7 or 8 months. I've decided on another brand. What a disapointment!
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"This coffee pot lasted approximately 3 months until some internal electrical function failed. Initially worked great and quickly made excellent, hot coffee. And then it didn't!"
5,Review,"I absolutely love the Farberware Percolator. I had one several years ago and the cord went bad. This has a new, heavier duty cord that I am hoping lasts! It makes great tasting coffee super fast."
3,Limited Time,Farberware used to be the best...that is no longer the case...I seem to be purchasing a new pot every 8 months now..They burn out rather quickly..with everyday use...I am going to purchase another brand this time...
1,Don't bother,"My husband and I looked forward with great anticipation to a great cup of perc'd coffee, after many years of drip. Based on the reviews, we purchased the Farberware 12-cup percolator, and it was wonderful when we first bought it. We've had it for about 2 months, and in the lsat few weeks we've noticed the coffee getting weaker and weaker. We've tried everything to correct the situation, last week bought espresso roast and made a pot - and it tasted like brown water. Very disappointed. Back to the drip pot for now. Save your money."
3,not made like they used to be,"Bought this to replace a 30 yr old farberware perc given to me by my mom, and less than a year later it's ready for the trash heap. The knob broke off (thanks to a cheap weld rather than a screw), the label is peeling, and overall the fit and finish is made-in-china cheap. In other words, not made like they used to be. I'm buying a vintage made-in-usa farberware (with real glass knob) off of e-bay and throwing this one away as soon as it arrives."
3,Bummed......,"I was loving this coffee pot until I get up one morning at 4:20AM looking forward to my jolt of java, when to my dismay, the pot conked out on me. Everything started off well enough. The pot made the usual sounds and seemed to get hot, but when I poured the coffee into my cup, it looked like dishwater....and the pot is only 10 months old.........Well, I am buying another one today, hoping my first one was just a lemon. Good Luck !!"
4,Farberware FCP280 8-Cup Percolator,"I had this percolator before and it lasted about 3 years. It made perfect coffee all the time but it died. I tied to replace it by trying to find one in a local store but I had no luck and decided to purchase a different brand. That was a big mistake and I had to return it and bought a drip type which turned out to be even worse.I ended up going back to the Farberware and I am back to great coffee. I think this coffeemaker makes the coffee a lot hotter then my previous Farberware and I find myself pulling the plug out so the coffee does not overcook.I hope the Farberware percolator lasts longer then my old one, they used to last forever."
2,Works great but coffee taste has poor quality.,"This works great. It's stainless steel, which is a plus. But the coffee does not taste very good. The same coffee beans ground for a drip coffee maker taste remarkably better. This makes great coffee beans taste like coffee store generic beans. Also, it take twice as much coffee to make an equal amount of coffee. So, over the long term, it's more expensive to use."
3,Short Wire,"When I brought my last Farberware coffee pot, it had a longer wire. This pot came with a short wire and I don't have a alot of outlets in my old house so I can't plug it in where I want to. If you have a longer one I would like to buy it. I know it is for safety but I'm a senior and very careful.Theresa Kovacs"
3,bitter,"I was never able to make coffee with this coffee maker that didn't taste over-extruded, no matter what kind of grind/coffee/amount I used. I gave up. It was drinkable, but that's all."
1,Percolators merely Rebrew over and over again,"I don't understand the love of these things. They run the water through the grounds,then run the brewed coffee back through the grounds, then THAT in run through again! These things make the worst coffee ever!!! Run away! Run away!"
2,"Water seeps into the base and rusts connections, causing it to fail","Water gets into the base and rusts wires inside, which break off. I repaired it once and it happened again. The second time I gave up trying to repair. I did notice that there are holes in the base. Drain holes? If they had built the screw-on base with a rubber gasket there would be no water problem and hence no need to drain.I you do buy this product, be careful about drying it upside down, which would allow water to enter the base. But since it only lasted 18 months, or so, I think I will look elsewhere for a replacement."
1,great for two weeks.,Worked great for two weeka until it started brewing tan water. We owned the same one and loved it as it worked for 5 years and then died due to corrosion of the wiring. This is the second one that died on us in the last three months. Oh by the way we followed directions exactly as written.
2,Makes a great cup of coffee... while it lasts.,"Yes, the coffee this percolator makes is great, but the my second one just died. The coffee goes from being rich, hot, and strong one day to luke-warm tea the next. The heating coil is made to fail. These percolators do not last much longer than their warranty. I really dislike buying the same product year after year, only to have to throw it out. What a waste. I will not being buying a Farberware product again."
2,farberware electric percolator,I have owned several Farberware stainless steel percolators. They are beautiful and make delicious coffee but the thermostat wears out in as little as 8 months. The longest I have had one last is 16 months. I just can't afford them any more. The one exception is a little four cupper that I bought at an estate sale used. I suspect that it is one of the old ones that was truly a Farberware. The Farberware name was purchased by Salton years ago. What burns me the most is that you can't buy replacement thermostats. I suspect that this is by design.I have a Presto pot which is equally good looking and makes equally good coffee. It came with a two year warranty and is still going strong after 10 years. The only drawback is that the last half-cup has dregs but we hav learned to be careful when the pot nears empty.
2,Best cup of coffee on the market - for one year,"Had rated this 5 stars and stated I'd buy one every three years. Not every year however. Pity, this was top of the line at one time. Now it's not worth the effort. On to something else. ---- This is my third 12-cup Farberware percolator. The second did not last as long as the first. The first approx 10 years the second 3-4 years. However I'd purchase one every 3 years if necessary. No other pot( or drip or single serve or overpriced coffee store)makes coffee as consistently good as this pot. I always fill water to the 10 cup line and use a slightly rounded 1/2 cup of coffee. Perfection in a cup."
1,don't waste your money,I purchased three of these because my mother had one of these for years. First two just stopped working right after warranty expired. Last one the handle fell off. Screw holding it on disintergrated.. No more Faberware.
1,Shame on Farberware!,"Once upon a time, you could buy a Farberware percolator, and it was a quality appliance you could enjoy and depend on for many years to come. Through my life, I have found I need to purchase a replacement sooner than the last. And, each time, they are obviously not the quality of the previous one. This time, I can't believe what a piece of junk they have become. My complaints are too many list. Shame on Farberware!"
4,Great coffee,"Makes a great cup of coffee! Fast and comes out HOT.Suggestions: Use the disc filters or small drip filter in the filter cup. Makes a mess trying to remove the grinds otherwise. As noted above, the coffee comes out very hot. Let it sit in your mug a few minutes before taking a drink.One suggestion to improve the unit would be to place the cup indicator marks on the inside of the stainless pot. Trying to read the marks that were stamped from the outside is difficult. Otherwise, it's a great percolator."
5,Love this percolator,"Several years ago, my mom gave me a small Farberware percolator and I was amazed at how much better coffee tasted as compared to a drip coffeemaker. It is a 6 cup, which translates to 3 mugs in my house. With four adult coffee drinkers in our home, whoever got up last had to make more coffee. On weekends, we were running the poor little thing all day. I found this 12 cup model and did not hesitate to order it. It works exactly as the small one does, making a full pot in about 10 minutes. Now we all get a first cup and most of us get a second. Perfect!"
3,faberware fcp412,It makes very good coffee. The trouble we had with it maybe dumb but we had an awful hard time to get the top cover off. Also the coffee pours so slowly. It maybe something we are not doing right but it acted like there was a air lock and the coffee dribbled out.
3,Not the same quality,"Faberware isn't the same quality that it used to be. Perks fine,but the workmanship isn't the same. Basket inside isn't round, has a small crack in top, so top of the basket doesn't seal tight. You have to line the sealed side of the basket up with the spout so grounds don't seep out when pouring. Other little things like the handle and spout are not exactly opposite each other. Picky ... I know but not the old quality workmanship. Found an old one at Goodwill - much better! The vendor and shipping were great, quick etc. Nothing bad to say about the seller!"
1,Unhappy,"I bought a Farberware 4 cup Perc for my self and one for my friend as a gift in March of 2009. His stopped working a year later and mine stopped working last month. I am very disappointed. Obviously Farberware quality has gone down the drain. They worked good while they worked, but I planned on getting more than a little over a year out of them. Will never buy Farberware again."
1,short lived,"This was a good percolator when first purchased, but it only lasts one year. It no longer heats the water enough to perk. This one replaced one just like it that also only lasted one year. This one-year planned obsolescence is for the birds. I'd rather pay more for one that lasts longer than keep feeding money to Farberware every year."
1,Frustrated,We have owned many Farberware Perculators over the years and in the last few years we have stayed with them in spite of the increasing rate of breakdowns. We were patient too long and will not buy another.
1,Poor quality percolator,"If I could, I would give a ""zero"" star rating for this product. I purchased this Farberware percolator in April, 2001. It makes good coffee, but the base cracked one day after making coffee. I always took good care of the percolator, including carefully washing it by hand, so it didn't crack because of abuse. It was just sitting on my kitchen counter when it cracked. It was 1/3 full with coffee after making a pot 15 minutes earlier. It is the second time this has happened to me. The first time was with the smaller Farberware 4-cup percolator. I strongly advise against purchasing this brand."
1,Quality not what they used to be.,"We purchased this percolator because my wife's mother owned one for over 20 years and it worked great. It made good coffee.Well the first one we bought broke within 3 months. Heating element went out. We returned and got another. This one lasted a year and half. Then the heating element went out. Had it fixed as it was outside of warranty. 1 year later it broke again. Surprise, the heating element went out.Keeping the price down has a downside, cheaper parts that do not stand up over time. I would prefer to spend a little more and not have to replace it every year or so. My mother-in-law got quite the deal in only having to buy it once in 2 decades.We are done with Farberware."
2,"Great coffee, Terrible Quality","We got a Farberware as a wedding gift over 15 years ago, it lasted about 10 years. Since then, in the last 5 years we've bought 3 replacements. They work great, until right about the 12-month mark, when it begins brewing luke-warm light brown water. I would rather pay more and have a pot that lasts longer ... it seems so wasteful to throw a pot away that still looks great."
1,Won't Make Coffee,"We have owned a Farberware coffee pot for 40 years and have always bought a new one after many good years of service. Just bought a new one and guess what...it won't make coffee, just some brown water. Evidently when they started making it in China, quality went away. Will never use Farberware coffee pot or any Farberware again. I suggest you look around for something else."
1,Not pleased,"After less than a year, lost heat. Coffee was barely warm after brewing. Other than that, plan on buying another percolator."
4,Farberware Percolator,"I have used Farberware in the past. The heating element eventually goes, but the Farberware company still makes the best one on the market. I wish I could have gotten a 12 cup, but it was not offered. The 8 cup is just not big enough for my needs."
1,Another example of selling the brand while cheapening the actual product,"I had a 4 cup Farberware perculator which was handed down from my parents, it actaully had the stone stem inside and it gave me years of reliable service. It finally breathed it's last breath a few years ago. A few days ago, the 2nd replacement Farberware Percolator [8cup] (the first one's cheap plastic bottom cracked within a few months) just died, it's been less than 2 years. I understand that's how things are made now, manufacturers would prefer you have to buy a new one every few years, but I guess we as consumers can control that by avoiding brands and companies that do that. I will not be going back to this for a 3rd time."
1,luke warm coffee,Last two coffee pot purchases have not been good. Coffee is NOT hot. I give up - and am searching for a better brand.
4,Makes good coffee,"Nice coffee pot, but the stainless steel insert is a little large for the pot. I half to struggle very hard to get the lid off every morning. Could of been designed better.Does make good coffee once you get it apart to get the coffee made."
2,Farberware 2-4 cup Percolator,After only two weeks the knob on the lid broke so I cant use it. I almost got burned trying to take the lid off.
1,Second Faberware 12 cup percolator,"I have owned a Faberware 12 cup Percolator for about 15 years. The only thing that went wrong with it was the cord, which I was able to replace. Meanwhile I purchased a new one, same model. The thing goes through the perk cycle and when it stops , the coffee is like dishwater. It is so weak, it is not drinkable. What I discovered was, the old one was made in the USA and the new one was made in China. My cousin purchased the same one about a year ago and had the same problem."
5,Tried and true,"I have used Farberware coffee pots for the last 25 years and I can't be without one. Dissapointing, however, my mom's lasted 20 years and I have been through 3 in the last 10 years. True, when they say, 'they don't make em like they used to', but still not complaining about the quality of the product. It's worth the money, but try to get one on sale, or at a discount, at least!"
5,Farberware 2-4 cup works well,"Coffee pot works well and makes good, flavorful coffee. The Amazon price is the best one you'll find on this item; all the others were at least $20 more. Coffee pot is cheerfully noisy, as all percolators are, and gets the job done fairly fast (percs always take longer than drip, remember). The only thing missing from this unit is a light that goes on while you are percolating, and either goes off or changes color when it's done. You simply have to listen to tell when it's finished. But other than that, no complaints! I've found Farberware to be a good brand, and as long as you keep the pot and its components clean (free of oily coffee buildup) and don't get water in the electricals, you should be fine. Also, to get the best flavor, you might want to use a non-chlorinated bottled water (rather than tap, if you are running city water). I have found that to make a decided difference in any coffee making."
2,Works great - for about six months,"We've gone through two of these percolators in the past year. Each worked very well for a few months, and then problems with the heating element started. On the first unit, the element failed completely after six months, and on the second unit the failure was gradual and insidious. Our coffee gradually became weaker and cooler over a couple of months until one day I realized the pot was not heating the water properly.I note that the price is higher now that what we paid. Too many warranty claims Faberware?"
2,Licensed products not the same quality you remember,"I've owned two of these. Each only lasted about two years. I expected more from Farberware. One of the reasons I started buying these percolators is because my mother-in-law has had the same one for 20 years. It still outdid my newer ones in terms of performance and they both broke. So I did a little research. This model is built in China by a company that's not Farberware. That company bought the name Farberware and uses it to sell products. The old Farberware you remember built products in the Bronx. They were built to last. After finding this out, I decided to find a used Farberware percolator from the old company. I found one on a leading online auction web site and purchased it for $20 (shipping included). It has been everything I thought it would be and more. Beware the brand names. Know who really makes that product before you buy. You'll be happy you did."
2,Farberware percolator,"After using the coffe pot once, the male plug broke loose, and the plug wouldn't connect to the electricity. My husband had to glue the plug to stabilize the unit. We were disappointed in the fragility of such a well-known and expensive product. Now that it's fixed, it runs fine. However, if I wanted a defective coffee pot, I would have gone to a yard sale."
4,Revision,Purchased 4/25/10 and it has already stopped perking (stopped perking in less than 1 month). Yuk!Sorry....6/2/10...the only problem was the holes in the coffee basket were all clogged. Works perfectly fine.Apologize for bad review.
2,"give me the ""un-improved"" model","Having purchased Farberware percolators over the years, this seemed to have been another ""easy purchase""; what a disappointment this ""new and improved"" model has been. The new electrical cord and heating elements in this unit makes the coffee so hot that its not even pleasant to drink. It seems as though the new cord may have been made to accommodate people who keep their coffee pot plugged in for hours, but who really does such things?? If I can find a model that is not the ""new and improved model, that is what I will purchase to replace this one."
1,DO NOT BUY,Farberware is not the same as it used to be. I had my older Faberware 12 cup Percolator for over 10 years before it died. I bought a new one last year and the thermostat is already broken. The difference in the pots from 10 years ago to now is evident. Its garbage. I would not recommend buying it at all.
1,Poor Quality,I have always relied and used the Faberware electric coffe makers having been introduced to these units growing up. The design and style did always make a reliable great pot of coffe.However over the last few years me and my wife have had to replace the pot every year due to the pots fail to keep the coffee hot. I have looked into repairing the units butt the cost to replace the element/sensor is not an cost effective option.Faberware has failed on delivering a quality product. This was never an issue when the pots were made here in the USA. I will not reward Faberware any longer by purchaing a pot that last only one year.
1,poor quality coffee maker,"I bought my Farberware 8-cup percolator about a year ago. First, the handle fell off the lid. When I tried to buy a replacement from Farberware, the company sent me a lid that fit, but that caused the coffee pot to stop brewing. So I've been using the lid without the handle. Now, today, the handle fell off the pot itself. This coffee pot is just really cheaply put together. Very sad, because I know my parents had their Farberware pot for years. So the quality must be declining, like just about everything else. I'm buying a new percolator today -- probably the Presto."
2,MAKES GREAT COFFEE UNTIL...IT STOPS WORKING,"The percolator worked great for approximately 5 months. Then, the thermostat died. After looking at the negative reviews on this product, it appears that many folks have had the same experience. The Seller has pulled this product from their shelves since they could not send me a replacement. Probably not a good idea to buy this item until they have new stock with the thermostat problem fixed. Amazon is helping me get a refund for this item. I used to think Farberware always stood for quality products--now, I am bit leery about purchasing more Farberware. How disappointing."
2,Farberware Qualtiy Is NOT What It Used to Be,"Several years ago we were looking for a good percolator. We were tired of marginally hot drip coffee. Friends had the Millennium model; it and the one before it failed prematurely. We thus opted for the percolator. The first one we bought lasted about two years. We expected longer, but it was better than the Millennium. That's a sad statement of product quality expectations! We foolishly bought another one. The engineering is superb. This one died 16 days past the warranty expiration. A manufacturer's dream come true. Farberware is not Farberwear. For us, it's Farberware-no-more."
1,"Six months later, and it's dead","I've always loved the taste of a fresh-brewed cup of coffee from a Farberware percolator. Over the past few years, I've felt they died prematurely, but nothing like this! I ordered one from Amazon in March. Went to make coffee this morning, everything sounded as it should, went to pour a cup - HOT WATER. Rusty-looking hot water.I had come to accept that these pots don't live long, but six months???? Ridiculous."
1,Be careful of getting a Shock!,"We recieved our Farberware 12 cup percolator as a shower present 15 years ago. We have actually been using it for about 10 years. We are no longer using it and will probably bring it to the recycling center nex trip because as another reviewer mentioned it is very easy to get a terrible shock from the unit. My husband was making the coffee and touched the unit and the sink and wham! Thank GOd he is fine, but this happened and we didnt realize why. The plug is not grounded! We do have the ground fault outlets in our kitchen, but the plug on the pot only has 2 prongs. I searched online and I was not able to find a plug with 3 prongs for a ground. Has anyone else discovered one? Please be very careful.These are very dangerous coffee pots."
2,Pray you won't need the warranty!,"We have used Farberware Percolators since the 1960's. Our last purchase, an eight cup, lasted only one month. Still in warranty, I called to make a claim. I found the ""customer service rep"" so uncooperative and plain hateful that I decided to skip the warranty and go elsewhere. The ""lady"" that I talked to is meaner than water moccasin."
2,my mistake,"fcp412 requires a tool to remove top,water fill marks under handle,only good for 12 cup fill.takes patience to pour,compare at a store before blindly buying."
2,Electric Farberware Coffe Pot,"I love the product, always have, but they are not making them well at all. It is very tinny and it is already showing signs of what looks like rust to me. It is suppose to be stainless steel, but I am really not sure. Years ago this product lasted for a good ten years, now it lasts MAYBE 6mos to a year! Not the sellers fault, the manufacturer."
1,buyer beware,"the photo of the farberware 240 percolator does not tell what happened to the original design. some idiot changed the inside of the pour spout into a ""chinese teapot"" and this product is now extremely dangerous & messy when pouring hot liquid. what was originally a beautiful product has been ruined."
2,the little pot that almost could....,"This percolator makes really great, rich, hot coffee....and in about four minutes!! That's the good news.The bad news is I have owned two of them in the past year and a half...as they die in about eight or nine months. RIP, Farberware."
1,Great coffee but zero product quality,"I am a long time Farberware percolator customer. Growing up, it was the only coffee pot ever used. The ""quality ship seems to have sailed"" for Farwerware. I have had issues with broken posts where you plug the cord into the pot and failed burners.While the pots used to last my parents for years, the pots I have had lately last 12 months or less. I have had two fail within the past 24 months, and others went early before that.It's a shame that they have opted to make these pots in China with cheap parts. I'm looking at alternatives versus filling the landfills with these expired pots every year."
3,Great while it works,"I've had one of these for a year and a half, and while it still makes great coffee, it also makes a great mess as it's developed a leak where the side of the pot is joined with the bottom. Customer service (It's not even Farberware anymore) was polite but firm that the one-year warranty was up. Unlike the other person who was offered a refurbished unit, I didn't even get that option. Oh well, they used to be a good name, but now that they're made offshore by a different company, they appear to be disposable."
2,"The Quality has gone, ------> to China","Yes, once upon a time this Farberware coffee pot lasted. We had one lasting at least a decade. Then we bought a new replacement, made in China, which failed in just 4 mos. It cost $15.00 to replace it from the factory. This second, now 9 mos old produces stained, lukewarm water. In each case, the thermal switch fails, an easily replaced and cheap item. Except the factory does not make any parts available as it once used to. Hoffman Industries makes similar thermal switches, which cost $0.65 each. I ordered three temperature ranges to potentially fix my pot myself. The part most likely to fit, is Therm-O-Disc #36TO1-L80-8c I hope to leave a follow-on report of success/failure."
5,You owe it to yourself to own this machine,"If you like hot,, delicious coffee in the morning (or anytime), you must buy this percolator. I have owned them for decades, literally. and without fail, they make the best coffee this side of your favorite donut shop. The coffee is hot, unlike those lame drip machines, and delish!! You can buy the cheapest coffee in the market, and still it comes out tasting great, and in an instant. The machine lasts endlessly (unless you put the whole thing in the dishwasher-not recommended), and you don't ever have to buy a filter. So soothe your inner caffeine freak,and order the Farberware now."
1,This is not your mothers Farberware.,The FCP series looks solid but works briefly. You will be lucky if it continues to work for more than 6 months. The 2 parts that make this coffee maker work (i.e. the heater coil and thermostat) are poorly made and will fail. No replacement parts are available. Save you money and find the older #142 series.
5,2 cups of coffee,"If you want a reliable 2 to 4 cup coffee maker that perks a good cup of coffee, consider this one. Although a product of Black and Decker (who makes junk in my opinion) this product meets or exceeds our expectations everyday. And it is used EVERY day."
1,Farberware percolator is an unreliable product,I have had 2 Farberware Percolators #FCP412 in four years. The heating element does not work after2 years .
4,Makes Great Coffee,I bought this product because I was tired of BITTER coffee. This product heats the water to boiling which removes the bitterness from the coffee. I have no complaints against this product.
2,Farberware Percolator,"In the past year, due to the decline in the electrical materials used to make Farberware percolators, I have had three different units break within a couple of months. Before this year, I had a Farberware percolator that perked non-stop for ten years. As for the one year warranty, by the time you pay for the cost of all the shipping, the sum comes close to the cost of a new unit."
2,Perkie,"I bought this little Farberware FCP280 8-Cup Percolator due to it's 8 cup feature; it would take up less space and I needed a new coffeemaker since I broke the glass decanter to my old one which was impossible to replace. I tried the perkie for 1 month and the gave up, went back and bought another drip coffeemaker. I'm a bit dissapointed with the coffee it made, although very hot, the coffee was practically flavorless. I used the same ammount of coffee that I would use for 8 cup drip, yet to get flavor out of the percolator, I needed to use another scoop. It wasted coffee and still didn't have that ""bite"" of flavor I love. Also, percolators are messier to clean.I read online in a coffee blog to never use a percolator, they make the coffee too hot and kill the flavor. I think there is truth to that concept as now that I'm back to using a drip coffeemaker, I can use less coffee for a fuller, flavored cup of brew."
2,Farberware FCP280 8-Cup Percolator,"Prompt delivery, no window to see water level, coffee produced disappointing compared to Gevalia using equal amounts of coffee in each."
2,Not your mother's percolator,"I purchased the 12 cup percolator and have enjoyed using it every day for the last year and a half; however, last night as I was cleaning it- I noticed a hole in the black bottom area just below where the stainless meets; obviously it was overheating and melted an area of the plastic. My mother used a previous Farberware for over 10 years with no trouble. I am past the 1yr warranty so I am now in the market for one that will last me a few years! The quality just isn't there any more."
2,Horrible customer service,"I have, now had, been a Faberware customer for over 25 years, andI always used to love their percolator. Whenver there was a problem, you could connect directly with a nice lady in the U.S., who was always extremely helpful and courteous.Unfortunately, the company has apparently been sold, the units are now made in China, and customer ""service"" is non-existent.Their warranty is worthless, as I could not reach anyone by telephone or web site. My telephone call to their call center in Canada was dropped after having been switched to about 8 different voice-mail options.I bought my unit less than a year ago, and it now cannot get power.It is ready for the trash. I will absorb my loss, and look for another brand right away.I think Amazon sullies their reputation by continuing to promote Faberware.David M LigermanMiami, Florida"
1,"If you must have your morning coffee, look elsewhere.","We've bought two of these because my wife likes the idea of old fashioned perked coffee. Both of them (after about 2 years of daily use) have stopped being reliable. Sometimes the coffee is fine, but more and more often you fill it, plug it in, it perks and you get something weak and watery and undrinkable. We've found that if you unplug it, let it cool, then perk again you usually get a good cup the second time around. But that is not why you buy an automatic coffeemaker!I've looked up the mechanics of coffee percolators online and can't figure out why this should happen. But take it from a two-time owner, it does."
4,shop teacher,The perk was a suggestion by a friend who overheard me talking about the frustration of having that second cup of coffee (later!) and how the warmer on the drips do not keep the brew hot. So I gave this little guy a shot because if the outcome was good I would be a happy camper for a long time forward! I was more than pleased-and the other perk is no paper products involved-one less thing to shop for and saving a tree (maybe!)I am sipping the brew as I write this anecdote-it is goooood!!
4,Does what it says it will do!,"Say what you will, but percolators have several advantages over drip coffee makers, including the heavenly aroma and the steaming hot coffee. I bought this perc to use on weekend mornings and I've found that it does a great job on a consistent basis. You will, of course, need to experiment a bit with the amount of ground coffee you put it in, but I got past this stage in about three brewings. This thing is fast! I don't know if it will brew a cup a minute, but it's pretty darn close. Overall quality is above average and all the parts are quite easy to clean. I use filter discs in the bottom of the basket and this significantly reduces the sediment and grinds in the bottom of the unit. I also noticed that the basket doesn't have traditional holes, but has stamped slots. I don't know if this is the reason, but the basket is much easier to clean than my older percs. Overall, I'm very pleased and would recommend this unit to anyone who loves the old-fashioned ""perked' java."
4,Farberware percolator review,"This is our third Farberware percolator. We have 4 cup, 8 cup, and 12 cup models, one for every serving occasion. Guests often inquire about our good coffee which we attribute to the repetative percolation rather than the common one-pass drip brewing process. One draw back however; namely, the disc paper filters are hard to find in local kitchen appliance stores, even in some stores, which sell Farberware products."
1,Stay away,"The problem with this percolator is the lack of a timer. It doesn't perk long enough to make good coffee. I tried putting four times the normal amount of coffee in and it was still too weak. They should have spent the extra money and put a variable timer on it.How bad is the coffee? Real bad, worse than Tim Hortons. Really."
2,Leaky Lid-Erratic Brewing,"Farberware 8 cup is the only coffee pot I've used for the past 33 years. I've loved it until recently. My previous pot began leaking coffee through the lid during pouring; I assumed it was getting old, so I purchased a new one in late October. I have the same problem with the new one. Also, the perking intensity is erratic. Every once in a while, it just stops. I have to unplug it for a few minutes and then replug. I'm disappointed that I might have to switch brands; I love the look and the coffee when it's working correctly."
5,Love It !!,I HAVE LOVED THIS LITTLE PERKER SINCE THEY FIRST INVENTED IT MANY YEARS AGO AND NOW HAVE ORDERED A BRAND NEW ONE TO CONTINUE OUR FAMILY TRADITION AND FAVORITE.
1,Tinted water in the morning just doesn't work.,"This percolator made really good coffee for less than a year, then it began to perk less and less time and the coffee became weaker and weaker. Don't bother contacting the company if something goes wrong with it. I wrote from their website and got a confirmation of what I wrote and was told that they would respond within 2 days. Two weeks later and still no response. I used to think Farberware sold quality goods. No more and customer support is a misnomer. I won't buy from them again."
4,Coffeepot,"I bought this pot to keep coffee hot. It does. The first one that arrived leaked. This one didn't. It's not as heavy as pots of old, nor does it have the glass perc viewer, but it works fine."
2,Bad choice,"Reading the reviews & the description, this percolator seemed like a good buy. But the lid seals too tight to allow the coffee to pour correctly. A minor issue that was elminated by popping the lid up just a little. The biggest issue... bought it Nov 2010 and it has DIED already. Only made it to July 2011... eight months and a dead percolator. It will still get hot, but will not perc anymore. Bought a Hamilton Beach from Target, less money, coffeee is hotter, pours better... we'll see how long it will last."
3,Delcious brw but top too tight!,"Delicious coffee but the lid fits much too tight, making it extremely difficult totransfer freshly brewed coffee to a thermal caraffe."
5,Love this Farberware 4 cup Percolator,"This percolator was highly recommended in a blog on another site. I had to purchase to see myself.I use Dunkin Donuts Regular Coffee and the perked coffee is delicious. I like the size of the 4 cup b'cuz it fits nicely on my countertop...Now, I'm highly recommending that you purchase this percolator so you can achieve same enjoyment as many customers"
5,great coffee,"I was concerned that my drip coffee-maker had been in service too long - the inside was not open to being cleaned, but it appeared there was some sort of mold-build up.So I tried the Faberware percolated model, based on the recommendation of others on amazon. It works terrific - coffee is HOT - unlike coffee from drip coffee-makers. And I can clean out the inside - unlike the drip models, where the inside is sealed-off (and mold may build up).I would only recommend that if you want the 4-cup model, you might want to jump up to the next larger capacity. 4 cups equal 2 mugs, so if you want more than 2 mugs, go to next larger size."
5,wouldnt want to go back to adc,"i am ""tickled pink "" with my new perc-wonderfully hot coffee quickly percs in less than 10 minutes- no paper filter needed- keeps last cup of coffee as hot as the first- looks great on countertop, has filter cover that goes on before the top to the pot which keeps the grounds in the basket well- i hope to never go back to adc again!"
5,Farberware Electric Purcolator,"Great product,made to last,makes great coffee,in minutes.If you like percolator coffee and don't need more than 4 cups(really 2) at a time,this is the one."
3,didn't hold up,"I bought the 8 cup about 6 months ago. The coffe was good and I'll not go back to drip. The problem was I dropped it and didn't realize the plastic cracked. I kept rinsing it out after each use( I never submerged it)and about a week later it quit. I took it apart and found water had gotten into it. I dryed and cleaned it, fixed the crack, but it still won't heat up. I can't send it in for warranty because I dropped it. I thought it should have held up better for $50.00.I will buy a different brand."
4,Very nice coffeemaker,"We are very happy with this product. Keeps coffee piping hot, and very flavorful.Only downside is there is no water /coffee level viewer on the outside.I thoroughly recommend this coffeepot!"
3,Like the coffee. Hate the pot.,"I was getting grossed out by the film I would find in the water reservoir of my drip pot so decided to try a percolator. The coffee is great and the pot is easy to clean. BUT! Getting the lid off is difficult at best and you do want to take the lid off of the pot before pouring your first cup or the last cup will be full of grounds. I find it very difficult to see the markings when filling the pot. (I don't always make the same amount). I had a heck of a time finding a timer that would work with the pot. Even though you think the cord is in snugly, it isn't always, and then that timer you killed yourself to find can't do it's job. I am less than thrilled but don't really see anything on the market that looks much better. I will persevere!"
2,top snapped off,"Poor typical China made-the top knob snapped off and was not even inserted through the lid. glued on. it also requires you to unplug at the base each time. sometimes just makes hot water and doe not perk coffee. third one -no more. i am looking for an american made product. i have tried ge, cuisinart, and faberware. they all last about one year."
1,Stops perking before coffee is done,"Bought a new Farberware 12 cup after having one for 10 years. The new one lasted only 1 week before it started making weak coffee. Returned this as defective.Received a replacement and the new one did the same thing after 3 weeks.People buy this percolator based on it's old reputation but, now it's junk. Having better luck with Presto even though it is made in China too."
5,great coffee maker,if you like hot coffee this is your choice. takes no more time to set up to brew and keeps coffee hot for an extended period. had one years ago and this works just as well. not a waste of money.
2,You Get What You Pay For,Top knob came off due to manufacturing process.Makes a cup of coffee in three minutes.Perfect for a gift.Top needs to be attached by threaded screw.
1,Farberware Coffee Pot,"The product, a 12-cup faberware Percolator, Model FCP412, worked fine for 3-months and then slowly would not heat pot to complete percolation. Now we only get luke warm, clear water when plugged in, using cold water as per instructions. We have had this type pot in the past and only replaced it because the cord to pot connection became faulty."
2,What warranty?,"My first coffee pot was made in America and lasted over 25 years. I could get replacement parts for it, too. Based on my past usage I bought another one in February 2011, it was made in China with one year warranty. Thermostat went bad August 2012. I guess I should be happy it lasted more than a year and I didn't have more damage than a poor pot of weak coffee. Farberware has ruined a good name and lost my business as I have gone through two pots in less than five years. Don't waste your money."
2,"Same story here, after one year you get ""Coffee Water"".","As the others have mentioned, alot of money for an electric coffee maker that increasingly produces tea colored coffee, dry grounds in the hopper after going through a 'brewing cycle'. Not sure what the problem is, not hot enough to percolate up the stem to the coffee, not percolating long enough, faulty/short lived built in thermometer.... who cares! WAY TOO MUCH $$$ for this thing to crap out like this within a year. I never soaked it in water, always hand cleaned, the base was never submerged in water... it just....sucked! Too bad. Faberware should be ashamed. I'm getting a French Press and be done with it!"
2,Appears well made; but isn't,"I've owned three of these 8-cup Farberware coffee pots (because when they work they make excellent coffee), but now that the last one has failed after little more than a year, I won't buy another. Although the pot appears to be sturdy, it is not. Even with proper care the last two have failed within a year or two from purchase. Worse still, when mine have failed, they've failed due to an electrical problem that caused the ground fault circuit in my kitchen to trip so the problem was dangerous. Farberware made excellent products at one time, but this coffee pot is no longer one of them."
1,"New owner, poor quality and service","I have used a Farberware Percolator for years and was very satisfied in the past. However, my recent purchase was unsatisfactory. The spout on the pot was poorly welded and leaked on first use. Also, the metal used seems thinner than previous models.When I tried to return it to Farberware, I was told there would be a charge to exchange the pot. After one use! I was told the company was under new ownership and that is their new policy.The problem was quickly resolved by Amazon, who knows the meaning of customer service. Lesson learned: do business with Amazon, never purchase Farberware products again."
2,Exchange it with factory,"I bought one of these perks from ebay and it was much lighter than my old one. The basket, rod and basket lid weighed 20 grams less than my old pot. When I poured from the spout, I would lose 1/2 a cup on the kitchen counter.I called the factory instead of returning it to Amazon because I was afraid Amazon would send me another just like it. The factory sent me a shipping label and two weeks later I got a new pot. It is heavier than the one I sent them and it doesn't leak a drop on the kitchen counter when pouring coffee from it. The coffee is GREAT!!If your pot doesn't pour properly, send it back to the factory!!"
5,If you love the smell of the ocean.....,"I can't get enough of these wonderful bath salts. Made with fine Dead Sea Salts and seaweed powder, it makes bathing feel like a trip to the Bahamas. The salts are a beautiful deep teal blue that make the bathwater look like the cleanest of blue ocean water and the smell is heavenly, especially if you're into ozone scents. It does relieve mild stress and leaves the skin quite soft and fragranced. It also has a matching shower/bath gel that makes it a double delight when used together. I used to be able to find these products at upscale department stores, but have not seen them there for a long time. However, they are still available online at various beauty stores and of course, at the Molton Brown site."
1,DON'T BUY PRODUCT!!,I bought 2: 1 of them came broken. The other one broke on the third day> Poorest quality!!!!!! Hate it!
2,Poor Quality,"This product was poorly built. The little nails used to expand the gate pops out, which results in the wood detaching from each other as the gate is being folded in and out. Craftmanship is of poor quality. I wasn't expecting it to be of oak, but I was expecting rivets to be used to allow for a more dorable product when the gate is folded and expanded. Not happy with this product!"
3,Pretty by flimsey,"I have a small dog and she can fit under the gate, but with an easy modification, this was fixed. Good for the price."
2,useless gate,"It's too flemsy and my small dogs can knock it over and go under it..it's too high off the ground and I had to add hooks to keep it stable and prevent dogs from being able to knock it over, it really was a waste of money and I should have just brought a baby gate instead."
1,You Get what you pay for,"This item was poorly built. The density of the wood was extremely light, and the expanding lattice is only connected to each side in one place. I assume this was to make the extending fence easier to adjust, but it is so loose that the sides leaned inward and to make it even work to hold my 15lbs dog I had to use a tension bar to hold it against the door frame. Within a week one of the connections had split making the entire thing completely useless. If they had just added connections to the sides it would have been a lot better but the whole thing is so light that any size dog could push it out of the way."
2,Wooden fence,I thought this would be more sturdy but it is very flimsy wood. Not very well built. A small dog can knock it over.I wouldnt recommend it
1,Bad quality,"It is broken when I received the product. Some of the thin wood frame was dropped and my husband needs to nail it to fix them. It looks not sturdy but for the time being, we use the item block our door from the yard after our repair."
5,Expanding wooden fence.,The gate met my expectations. It arrived in a timely way and was exactly as described. I like it because I can block off an entire area with just one freestanding gate.
4,Works great unless you have a smart dog.,Worked great for awhile. Then my peek learned to simply slide gate to the right with her paw. Still works well if the base is anchored with something. Worth the price.
2,Expandable Fence,I don't think that this gate is constructed well enough to withstand the rigors as a child gate. It is possibly usable as a pet gate if the petis already disciplined. It would make an attractive divider to be used with a decorum inside or outside but not as a primary means to preventpassage.
2,"Serves the purpose, for now","It is not even close to the color in the picture, which has the appearance of being stained. This is closer to unfinished wood. Wood is poorly finished, has a lot of rough spots. Also, the picture does not clearly show that when fully expanded, it raises the bottom up about 8 inches and a small dog intent on getting to the other side (like my two Cairns) can shimmy underneath. Being as light as it is, I fear it could fall over on them when they try to get under it."
2,Wooden Fence,"The fence is cheaply made, flimsy and not worth the money. One of the fences I ordered broke within a few days. One of the staves split. The staves are just NOT strong enough!!! I would not recommend this product to anyone and I certainly won't puchase any more of them."
2,unfinished wood,"I ordered this to place in front of my stairs to keep my 16 month old from climbing up them. I knew it would act as a barrier and she would avoid it; I knew it wasn't something permanent or particularly sturdy. As soon as I got it, I noticed it said, ""Keep pets and children away"" on the box. When I opened the box, I saw that it was unfinished wood. If you touch it, you are bound to get at least one splinter. In the picture, it looks finished and painted/stained, but that is not the case. Perhaps it could be used outdoors, but I don't see how or where..."
3,good for what i needed it for,"yes this is a very flimsy gate but.. i just needed it to block my small dog on my porch, i needed one with its own 'feet' I have had it for three years and it is missing a few slats, but it still does the job. I keep it outdoors on a protected porch so .. It works for me. I am now getting another one, same one, just know it is not sturdy and not for blocking children, we sit on the porch with the dog and it just reminds him to stay with us !! I would give it a 5 because it is just what I needed but.. that really would be misleading-it def is flimsy, but price is right and three years is three years !!"
1,aweful,"this gate is poorly made, it fell apart about 15 min after i set it up, the sides broke off the ends and it looked like they cut the wood pieces right before shipping. not impressed."
1,poor construction,"These fences are poorly constructed and extremely flimsy. I wish I had read the other reviews before I purchased them. I purchased three but only returned two since unfortunately, I no longer had the box from the one we opened and tested. After writing that I wanted to return the fences, I was informed I would have to pay the shipping to return them, so I returned the two still in their boxes and it cost me $23 to ship them back. The nails all started popping out of the diagonal slats, and the space created below the fence once it is stretched out was so high that any dog or child could easily get out underneath it, not to mention it would fall apart easily with any pressure against it. Not sure what these fences are to be used for, but definitely not to prevent children or dogs from passing through."
3,Nice but not very sturdy,I used this fence to keep my 30 lb dog out of a certain area. She is small but could easily push it over. It took about two times of her attempting to run through the fence until she accentually made it through. Now there is a big hole in the fence and it is of no good. The fence looks nice but will not be strong enough to keep out pets.
2,Expanding Wooden Fence is cheaply made!,The first thing I notice when the shipment arrived is that the wooden fence is very fragile and one of the wooden piece on the fence was broken already!
1,I am sorry that I did not read the reviews re: quality,I purchased two of these gates and thought that they would have a finished look and be more stable then they are.They are not acceptable for inside the house. They are unfinished and have splinters sticking out from all areas.I am not sure just how long they will be here before they go into the trashI am sorry that I did not repurchase from QVC where I bought one that is finished and sturdy and looks nice in my home.I went for price NOT quality..What a mistake
1,Expanded wood fence,Snapped and fell apart quickly. Does not balance well on carpeted services. Would not purchase again. You get what you pay for.
1,Weak expanding fences,Very flimsy expandable fence - wind took it down first day and wrecked part of it. We bought wooden two-by-four frame to put expandable part in to salvage some of the cost. The expandable fence price is not worth the wood it's made of.
2,Flimsy,"I bought this to throw a towel over to block a view and I think it will work fine, but it is very flimsy and was missing a part for which I had to make a trip to the home store to get the missing nut. If you are trying to keep something out of an area, these are not for you."
1,Buyers Regret,"Absolutely the worst purchase I've made on Amazon. This fence is really paper weight. The wood begin to crack while I was assembling it. It is made of the cheapest materials. Also, while handling it, you can easily get splinters.Additionally, the wind keeps blowing it over. I am hoping to refund this purchase..."
2,Limited Use,"I wanted to use this as a pet barricade. We have two little dogs and it wasn't even heavy enough to keep them from knocking it over. In addition, the gap at the bottom is too large to keep small animals from just going under it. I'm sure it would be great for some other uses, but not to restrict your pets."
1,Rustic?,"I ordered 4 of these gates. I could not believe how flimsy and poorly put together they were, nothing like the picture which looks like a nicer gate. The ad said nothing about being ""rustic"", but the directions that came with the fence says ""rustic wood"". It is rough wood and is stapled together. I find the ad to be misleading. This is not worth the money."
3,Expandable Gate,"This gate is a little on the flimsy side, but for the money is worth buying. So far it has kept the neighborhood dogs off my back porch, and that's what I bought it for."
1,No suitable for children/pet safety!,"The company is great and ships promptly and refunded me promptly. Product is terrible. Besides the fact that it broke as soon as we stretched it, the materials used to make this are of poor quality. A child or animal could break the ""fence"" portion with a gentle tub/pull. DO NOT purchase if this is meant to keep your child/animal out of harm's way. Unfortunately, I was so excited by the fact I found something like this, i didn't bother reading the reviews. People share my concerns."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Cheaply built. The joints are held together with nails that are bent over in the back. will not last long at all. One ""hinge"" fell apart within a week."
3,"It works slowly, and unevenly","I have been using this soap for the past month and a half and it really does lighten your skin to it natural color. However, It takes a while ( I still have darker sunburned areas that need to be ligtened) and the lightening is uneven. For example. Part of my hands are their natural color while part of my hand is still dark from the sun. My arms have not lightened at all but my legs are back to their original color.If you have a small area to treat this product is great but if you have a wide area that needs to be lightened just know you will have multiple colors until everything evens out."
2,"Ehh,","This soap wasn't too spectacular. It smells kind of like cinnamon or something, and I haven't noticed any skin lightening. Biggest problem? DO NOT USE ON FACE. I've always had great flawless skin, and after one use of this soap my face broke out in the worst way it ever has before. I'm not sure I'd recommend this to anybody."
2,Not so good...,"I'm guessing it must take a while to work, cause i was using it for a month and nothing happened. It just made my face really DRY...but everyone is different so it might work for someone else."
4,A Great Alan Parsons Collection,"Having grown up listening to all his work, this ""Best Of"" captures most of it. Since all the Alan Parsons albums were based on a theme, it is a bit hard to capture a ""best of"" and have it make sense lyricaly. However, if you don't over think this and just enjoy the music it works. I saw him live about a year ago. If you get the chance, don't miss it."
5,"Don't own it, but know all the songs - great overview of APP","This looks like a great collection of some of the best Parsons tunes from his best albums, and thankfully leaves off anything from later albums that, while they have their moments, just aren't nearly as good as the albums featured on this compilation.One comment on the versions of Dream Within A Dream and The Raven - they were available on CD in their original versions, on the Mobile Fidelity series of excellent discs. Regrettably this version has been out of print for some time, so in that respect it is correct that this collection is now the only way to hear these as originally recorded - which is good because the remasters with the Orson Welles bits and the heavy-handed guitar solos and drum remixes were awful. Good to know the original versions were used here. For the uninitiated, this looks like a great low-cost way to start."
3,It was ok,"This book had a magnificent whirl of fun twisted into it, while it still kept the seriousness of jing wang."
4,Flawed; but a classic none the less...,"This is a very readable and enjoyable history of the evolution of the various ""schools""(or philosophies)of self defence with the sword, expressed with a detailed look at their main proponents, the salon masters of years ago.Castle's personal sketches of the masters are enlightening and full of anecdotal material. The accompanying illustrations are mostly reproductions of period wookcuts which are invaluable in themselves.However, the poorly reproduced photographic addenda reveal that Castle was as much as a century off in his ability to identify and date sword types. This of course was not the purpose of his work.Even given this small flaw, I wholeheartedly recommend this for the fencer or martial artist of any level who is interested in the roots of the art. We are fortunate that Mr Castle provided us with such a good, solid history."
3,"This CD is mislabeled - NOT PUNK AT ALL, IT'S PURE SKA","Somehow this cd got listed under alternative/punk when it is pretty much all ska. Now if you really like ska then it might be 4 or 5 stars but I'm into punk so I can't really rate pure ska. I got a ska CD from my bro which is good but this disc is kind of ho-hum. Some of these songs are just instrumental, with a very slow carribean/calypso sound to them. There are a few catchy ones towards the end of the album but other than that it totally lacks energy. If you like ska, for **** you can't go wrong. But I waited two months for this to arrive. If you are expecting punk, check out the Fat series or Punch Drunk volumes."
3,"Durable, but poor sound quality","This product is certainly not for anyone looking for quality sound. Reception is poor, and the tuner is difficult to work with. However, I suppose you could expect as much from a shower radio, and the radio's durabilty and true water resistance almost make up for its shortcomings."
1,Power hungry,"I bought this shower radio last year. It did not play CDs, but the batteries died after only a few uses. I don't know if it was defective or if the constantly running clock caused the battery death. I was very disappointed and returned it. Another shower radio that was much cheaper and didn't have a clock runs forever on batteries."
3,"Poor sound quality, plenty of durability","This product is definitely not for someone looking for quality sound. However, if you want a shower radio that is durable and truly water resistant, you should consider Wet Tunes."
2,Drained Battery,"Every time I turned it on, I had to turn the sound all the way up, which wasn't so bad, but the batteries ran out like every 2 weeks! And I wasn't using a CD, just radio! And I don't take long showers either. I just got sick of it!"
5,Cute Owl set,"We recieved this set promptly and have enjoyed the simple wood design and creative nesting tree and owl set. A really fun gift for children, boys or girls."
2,Could not read my 2003 file!,"I'm sorely disappointed in this new version of Money, because it can't even open my 2003 money file. There's no indication as to why. It just ignores my old file and start a new, blank file without alerting me. (Luckily it didn't corrupt the old file, so I was able to roll back to Money 2003 easily.)In terms of interface, it looks and behaves pretty much like Money 2003, so I think this is just a minor update."
2,Won't convert from Quicken 2004,"Contrary to what the box says, as of right now Money Deluxe 2004 will not convert from Quicken 2004 files. Microsoft says this is because they haven't gotten the Quicken 2004 file formats yet from Intuit, but they also say there is no estimated time to resolve this. Quicken 2004 has been out for a few months now - this is really a surprise."
5,Repeat purchase,This is my second purchase of Microsoft Money Deluxe. Purchase #1 was for my own use. I personally found this tool to be an excellent means of managing my finances. The second purchase was for a relative who has never been able to manage their money responsibly.The jury is still out on that one.
3,It's decent,I finally broke down and switched to Microsoft Money recently. It works well enough to manage my personal finances. I think the budget function could use a little work. I've got to manually download my credit card statement for some reason it doesn't catch it when it gets the checking and savings information from the same bank website and page. Over-all it has met my needs and no major complaints. I definitely like it better than Quicken.
1,Maybe I am wrong,"I have been using Quicken for a number of years. Believe me, I am not a real Intuit fan, especially after that ""Safecast"" number they pulled on Turbotax users last year.However, compared to Quicken, I think Money 2004 runs very slowly. I mean 25 seconds to show an account vs. about five on Quicken. Perhaps it calls for more RAM than my Quicken 2002. Or maybe those annoying smiling faces in the photos use up more memory and slow the computer down.And the Money interface is drab and hard to read. Not enough color to offset the entries and make the page readable. It gave me a blue screen and crashed the computer the first time I used it. That was enough."
1,Pocket PC ? - Don't buy!,I purchased Money 2004 for use with my Pocket PC. I have had nothing but trouble with it. It will not Sync properly and gives bad data.
1,microsoft money 2004 deluxe,Not user friendly geared to stocks and investing i was miss lead by vague descriptions of options
3,"Do you need it? Try it out, before you buy!","No matter whether you are a current user or interested in becoming a new user, you may want to try this program out, before you buy it.Microsoft has on its website a 60 day trial version of Money 2004 Deluxe. This should give you enough time to try it out. Since the file format changes every year you won't be able to use the Money 2004 file in your current Money version, if you're a current user, so either do double maintenance with both programs for a while or determine very quickly, if the new version is worthwhile getting."
2,Disappointed.,"Is Microsoft even listening to their customers? I agree with the previous review. This version adds a few things that you don't need and call it an upgrade. I downloaded the trial version and will not pay for this upgrade. The interface is exactly the same. There are no usability improvements and no improvements in the look of the product. Sure the Gainskeeper is useful but requires extra money for full use. The Experian credit manager does not even work if you have too much credit information (They will not produce a report!). Hopefully, nobody will upgrade this year and force Microsoft to make some real improvements even if they have to borrow ideas from Quicken."
1,Don't get this if you're a Quicken user,"I downloaded the trial version from Microsoft's Web site, and imported all my Quicken data. I started using the program, but soon noticed that numbers were subtly wrong. Some odd transactions (ones that were in Quicken, simple check payments) were missed; and the loans were so screwed up that some of the payments were showing negative principal payment.I can't trust the data I imported or anything I've done since then, which means that I wasted a half dozen hours on this. Save yourself the time, and don't do the same. If you want to use this (and it seems okay, except for its insane handling of ""matching"" transactions that are months apart to different payees for different amounts), start from scratch and don't import your Quicken data."
4,Nice Budgeting,"I like that Money 2004 will ""grab"" all of my transactions from my checking and credit card accounts. No more typing in every transaction!! It's good to know the shortcut keys too: Ctrl+M to mark transaction as cleared. I can also classify (in addition to categorize) my spendings as I'm learning to follow the ""60% solution"" budget. (http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Savinganddebt/Learntobudget/P36153.asp)Bad thing is the undo doesn't work well. I keep having to load my backup file whenever I realize I made a mistake."
4,Buen álbum!,"Decidí comprar este disco después que lo oí en el trabajo (una compañera de trabajo lo tenía en su oficina) y me pareció bueno. Sé que lo han criticado mucho porque no suenta tanto como la banda sinaloense tradicional, pero es que las cosas cambian...Es un buen disco para estar oyéndolo mientras estás con los amigos en una reunión dentro o fuera de la casa, incluso para lounge (en bajo volumen, claro).Mis favoritas son: ""Que te ruegue quien te quiera"", ""Para toda la vida"", ""Delante de mí"", ""Por ti"" y ""Sube, sube, sube""."
1,Lunatic,What kind of lunatic would charge a thousand do11ars for any VHS? This is utter madness & that dealer should be boycotted for life.
3,Fantasy not science fiction,"Sheri S Tepper has written some of the best science fiction in the world. This isn't one of them. I would cast it more as fantasy , aimed at the teen market. I was so disappointed. Perhaps more care needs to be taken with your classification system so that others don't make the buying mistakes I made."
5,Fundamentalism and American Culture,Good reading. It presents a good review of the culture and the strengths and weaknesses that religion can play in forming it.
3,Okay Book,"This book was kind of interesting with the pullouts and such, but the text is boring. I reccomend this for any girl who owns a Kit doll, because they would know her background, but if you are just buying this book just because, you probably won't get it."
3,It isn't about Alabama,"It should have a Purple/Gold cover. It was written after his LSU Championship, not the current Alabama Championship.The book IS of value, because of what Coach Saban has to say, it is timeless. My complaint is with the misleading cover they've put on the book.ROLL TIDE!"
1,Fin Fan,"Make sure you read the great chapter on quitting when things aren't going your way, only taking positions that are guaranteed to succeed and quitting on those who show faith and loyalty to you."
3,Decent ideas - Not bad for a first effort,"This is a good read for students of leadership, with plenty of good ideas that readers can adopt. While most of the components of his philosophy are fundamental (hard work, integrity, communication skills, balance, etc.), there are actually some original ideas that run counter to those pitched in typical success/leadership books. This is where I believe the value lies. Examples include focusing on the process - not the goals, setting a start time but not an end time, and playing to dominate (no matter what the score).Like him or not, Saban has a unique system that works (assuming he stays around long enough to implement it). This book is worth a read..."
4,Messenger vs. The Message,"I bought and read this book before Nick Saban left LSU. Regardless of what you think of Nick's subsequent career moves, the lessons presented in the book are solid, relevant and a good read for anyone middle school and upwards.Since the jacket cover has been changed to reflect Nick's new team, I just wonder if the paperback edition has all references to LSU edited out???"
4,Finally Buffy gets some respect.,"It was great to finally read a book about what ""respected"" people think about this incredibly great show. Each essay was different, of course, with each essayist going his/her own way to interpret, question, and praise the show. I particularly loved it because it focused more on plot and characters than it did on technical stuff. If you loved this show, then this is a book that you'll want on your shelf."
4,"Why ""Buffy"" rules!","Probably best suited for die hard fans of the show, this book collects essays from fans and pros analyzing, praising, panning, and deconstructing Joss Whedon's groundbreaking show. As you might expect, some of the essays degenerate into outright fanboy babbling, but some really resonate, especially Sherrilyn Kenyon's ""In Search of Spike's Balls,"" and Nancy Holder's ""Slayers of the Last Arc."""
3,Disappointing,"I ordered Seven Seasons of Buffy: Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Discuss Their Favorite Television Show because I missed seeing original episodes of Buffy so much. I also expected to read some great trivia and insider information that I hadn't heard, but no such luck. I enjoyed the essays by most of the authors, but many essays were just synopsis of the seven seasons, and I was there watching too, so the over explanations of some scenes was a bit boring. However there were some bright points, for example, Roxanne L. Conrad's Final Exam for Spatial Interdimensional Metaphysics was a great read, Sherrilyn Kenyon's Search for Spike's Balls was thought provoking, and although Scott Westerfield is a bit wordy, he makes some interesting observations. My main regret is that I didn't buy it used and save some of the money I spent."
2,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed in this book. There were no great insights into the show or the characters. In some places it was a scene by scene narrative of almost entire episodes. I much prefered the philisophical musings in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosphy"" edited by James B. South. At least it got me thinking. I was hoping this book (Seven Seasons) would show me aspects of the characters or plots that I hadn't seen - instead I got to read the very superficial musings of people with very little to share.I actually found the final essay in the book, ""Slayers of the Last Arc"" to be the most enjoyable and not just because of it's insight into the show but also as a great ""how to"" guide for writers. I also really enjoyed Sarah Zettel's ""When did the Scoobies become Insiders?"" and Jennifer Crusie's ""Dating Death"".This book is not a total write-off and I did finish it but I would look elsewhere if you're looking for something other than a basic episode guide."
1,Worst Buffy book ever. BIG disappointment!,"I have several Buffy books as well as books about other tv shows, like Angel, Charmed, Alias, etc. I've read books about the philosophy & psychology of The Sopranos, The Simpsons, The Matrix and others. That said...This book just wasn't interesting. It lacked depth, nuance, even a sense of humor. I read nothing new, radical or intelligent. I expected more and got even less. Don't waste your money!!! Buy ""Bite ME!""- The Chosen Edition by Nikki Stafford instead, SERIOUSLY."
2,Ok--but I expected more,"I was expecting a semi-academic work. Instead, the collected articles seem to be on par with what I would expect from a fan website--not a book for purchase. If you love all things Buffy, you may find some of the articles interesting. If you're looking for an academic analysis of Buffy, look elsewhere."
4,"A more immature Ramones, if that's possible","Sorry, but I love this album. Noisy, fast, and fun. More juvenile than most people will be able to handle, with songs like ""I Can't Stop Farting"" and ""Too Many Twinkies."" The memorable hooks will stick in your head for good, and the lyrics -- some dreamed up in the recording studio in minutes -- are hilarious. This album is for the most part very rough, but that's what makes it great rock & roll."
5,Gibraltar Wing nuts,Works great with my percussionist set up next to my congas at church. They were purchased for use with my cymbals.
4,WIll They or Won't They?,"The title, The Only Thrill, doesn't fit this film, which is about a decades-long bittersweet relationship between the characters played by Diane Keaton and Sam Shepherd. While it's obvious to the viewer that these two eccentrics are soul mates, it takes them most of the film to come to the same conclusion. A secondary plot involves her daughter and his son, whose own relationship begins to mirror that of their parents.This slow moving, but satisfying film, with all the missed opportunities between the couple, can be frustrating to watch at times, but the performances of Diane Keaton and Sam Shepherd make it worth seeing more than once. They also made a great pair in the film Baby Boom."
1,No Thrill,"The Only Thrill I found with this movie was seeing the nifty VW Beetle Keaton was driving. Watching a fifty-four year-old Shepherd selling vintage clothes and making love to a fifty-one year old Keaton (and this was supposed to be when they were young) was about as thrilling as seeing my granny's girdle flapping on a clothesline. Any guy willing to sit through An Unmarried Woman, and telling another guy the movie was good, probably needs to wear the used dresses he sells. The production of this movie, originally titled ""Tennessee Valley"" was moved to Austin supposedly because a local film crew couldn't be found. Truth be known, they couldn't hold the cameras still enough because they were laughing so hard at the casting of this thing."
1,6 to 10 day shipping....not,"Picnic World Plus advertises USUALLY SHIPS WITHIN 6 TO 10 DAYS. I ordered mine Jan 3, then a week later I get an email saying delivery will be Feb 12-25. That's 39 to 53 days!!!!! As of Jan 26th, advertisement still says ""6 TO 10 DAYS"". Be honest and update your website."
4,good value,"What can I say, for the price, these are great clubs. The real surprise though is I was expecting zinc irons like the ones at the sporting goods store, but instead these are Stainless Steel. And the driver is titanium with a good sound. The paint job on the woods are nice too. I like the red-pink piping on the female sets, nice touch. The irons have very good weighting, the driver is very easy and forgiving. The putter works good, but be careful of the ceramic face as they can chip on the corners if you don't watch out. I didn't like the bag straps, not very good for a female which is why I am giving it only 4 stars."
3,A disappointment.,"What a let down of a novel. Interesting to read a great writer floundering when writing another genre. Characters two dimensional, tale contrived, and Stevenson out of his depth when attempting satire. Basically I reckon his heart wasn,t in it and it shows."
5,Look and feel great !,"Fixing all parts together is a bit lengthy. However, they are of excellent quality and look elegant."
5,Digital Art Photography For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech)),"This is a great book for anyone using digital photography -- whetheryou are just starting out or have some experience. There is somethingfor everyone! I found it to be a great source of information when it comesto Photoshop. Of all my Photoshop books, I find I reach for this one themost. It is permanently planted by my computer for quick reference whenI need it. It has GREAT editing tips and is easy to read and comprehend."
2,okay,"I cannot believe that Shawn exists anywhere. Please tell me there is absolutely no brother out there that fit that MO. If he exist zap him back to Mars. Cheap and dumb that is so far-fetched. There was some funny scenes (the dinner and trying to duck out on paying a tab). Jocks are not all dumb and even if you find one that is leaning in that direction at least he would recognize Jesse Jackson and know that ""keeping hope alive"" is not a sick girl. As dumb as Shawn was he was still able to sleep with a knockout. What's that all about? I finished the book because I like to finish what I start. I give it two stars for effort."
2,Disappointed,"I read the book thinking, this will get better. But it really didn't. I found it humorous, but it was also lacking. It did confirm one notion, some people are just that cheap. Isn't it a shame?I hope Van does better on his next novel. I haven't given up hope."
1,Really Bad (and I don't mean good),"This book is filled with holes, inconsistencies and obvious stabs of humor which fail miserably. I found it insulting to the readers intelligence."
1,THE WHOLE STORY WAS WAY TOO FAR FETCHED,THIS BY FAR WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ-FOR SOMEONE TO DENOUNCE MICHAEL JORDAN EVEN IN FANTASY SHOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW-THE WRITER HAD NOWHERE TO GO WITH HIS STORY AND WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE TOO MANY TIMES
1,Very Disappointed,I did not enjoy this book at all. Shawn Wayne had to be one of the most ignorant men on the planet! It's a shame that there are really people out there that DO exist! I couldn't even laugh at the black tie scene because it made me positively sick! This book has no plot to it whatsoever! This was a guy who was totally clueless and had the nerve to not want a woman because she drives a stick! This book gives Black men a bad name!
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I was really disappointed with this book, after all the word-of-mouth I heard on how great it was. I agree with one or two of the critics who said how it started off strongly, but then it just kinda died. I've also noticed a number of comparisons between this book and Michael Baisden's ""Men Cry in the Dark,"" which I loved. A good book will allow you to relate to the characters or at least remind you of someone you know. None of the bros I know or have ever hung out with have EVER acted with such naivete like the Shawn Wayne character. I mean, true, there's nothing wrong with being a shy bro, but come on, let's not be clueless. I did ""get"" what Van Whitfield set out to do, which was make an entertaining, light-hearted look at the dating scene from a bro's point of view. Yet and still, I just had a hard time stomaching some of the courses of action taken by the lead character."
1,Beeperless lack the Beep.,"I thought the novel to lack insight and reality, in a word it was stupid I did not relate to the main character because he could not relate to himself very immature and if you need a crack head to tell you to get a answering machine to check your messages then you are missing a few screws yourself,I could not finish the book because I would have gotten sick."
1,HatedIt,"I hated this book. Once I finished it, I threw it across the room. We read it as a part of a book club, and no one liked the book. The characters were dull, and the story was uninteresting. The premise was unbelievable. I am sure there are men that judge women on whether or not they have cable, but those are the pathetic losers, like the main character, who are dateless. The dialogue was poor. The connections between the characters begged the questions why and how did these people end up together. When you don't have much time, and you enjoy reading, spending time on a book like this is disappointing."
2,Not my taste,"Don't get me wrong, this book was somewhat funny, nonetheless, but I guess I don't read novels in place of the Sunday's newspaper comic section. I was like, okay, get to the point. I had to question whether this was a book written for adults or adults with slim intellect. I'll probably never read another book by this author. His style is definitely not mine."
3,Very Funny and Entertaining,"Mr. Whitfield has a winner! This book was so funny, although the author expected us to believe that a Black man in America could be as naive as Shawn Wayne!!! I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and am buying his next book as well. It was smooth even reading and I was not even offended by the ""list"" of women's descriptions. Thanks Van for a wonderful read."
2,SO.....SO >>>>>>,"I have read like 2 chapters and already I find it too dumb for words. I think I came to this conclusion because of reading the reviews from you all. This really made me biased, I was hating the book even before I read it. You may ask then why read the book? I like to see for myself. Well I will finish the crap and write another review maybe it will have a funny ending."
1,WORST BOOK I'VE READ IN A LONG TIME,"This book could have passed for an 'ok' rating if not for theend. The author leaves us hanging and insults readers whentrying to convince us a person could be so stupid and ill- informed. Please, please save your money."
2,what happened van?,I tried really hard to finish this book but just couldnt. I did not like the main character at all although I feel that some guys do think the way this character does. The only thing I found intersting was his numbering system (personaly I'm a 4). My suggestion: read Something Is Wrong With Your Scale! It had me in stitches!
2,Where is this guy?,I would love to know where this guy lives. Could there really be a guy out there this naive. Don't get me wrong the book was o.k. It could have been better with a better character. Shawn(the main character) just seemed like he knew nothing about women. The mistakes he made through out the book was stupid. I think the author should Try Again.
4,`Waiting to Exhale'? Nope. Trying to stop hyperventilating!,"""Beepless Remote"" was very difficult for me to read. I am a Black woman. It's not easy seeing yourself and your contemporaries through the eyes of brothers who have been there. I know some of these women. (Heck, I've secretly BEEN a few.) Van Whitfield has captured the male angst of the dating scene and laid it all out for us all to see. The book was very clever. I'll never look at my friends who attend the Congressional Black Caucus Weekend or who watch ESPN the same way again. Turnabout is fair play. ""Beeperless Remote"" is a funny, in-your-face-look at some male-female relationships. But that's just the humble opinion of a 6!"
3,Shear disappointment,"I really enjoyed this book until the end. When I pay money for a book, I'd appreciate an ending (I'm funny that way.) I went along with Shawn's ignorance and naivete (it was fiction.) I found it to be very funny and easy to read, but I don't appreciate not getting an ending. After spending my hard-earned money, Mr. Whitfield should send me the ending free of charge...federal express! I shouldn't have to wait a year and spend more money! Ugh!!!"
2,I'm being generous,"This book was okay, with a few light moments, but I wouldn't read it again. Shawn was a little too naive and cheap for my liking (He's never heard of Jesse Jackson and he lives in DC. Give me a break!)It was easy to read, but it left a lot to be desired.Keep trying Van, you'll get better with time."
2,Too naive to be believable,"Is Shawn supposed to be a man of the 90's? It was humorous but a slow read, I skipped the profiles on each type of woman but must admit they seem to be on target. Michael Baisden's book was more timely."
2,Not Feeling It,"I surrendered to the hype surrounding this book, and wish I had not. I would not recommend this book. Shawn Wayne, the lead character, had to be one of the nerdiest, most unbelievably naive characters in contemporary fiction. After all the hype, I was expecting to delve in and read a book where I was supposed to relate to the lead character. Sorry, I was NOT feeling this book."
2,So Disappointed,"To each his own, but I have NO idea why people chose ""Beeperless Remote"" over ""Men Cry in the Dark."" My book club read both books, and the ""Men Cry"" book wins hands down to me. Shawn Wayne was a complete idiot. I sat there thinking to myself that there CAN NOT be brothas out there this stupid. True, ""Men Cry"" had some grammatical errors---but so did ""Beeperless."" I was so disappointed, because the leader of the book club had hyped it up so much, comparing it to Terry McMillan's ""Waiting to Exhale."" The ending to ""Beeperless"" is really what got me. I'm not player-hating, but maybe next time, Mr. Whitfield. Thanks for reading my review, one and all. Peace....C ya!"
1,Offensively bad; wish I could rate it lower,"Nevermind that this book is belabored with clunky pop-culture references. Nevermind that the plot -- as protagonist Shawn Wayne might put it -- is as thin as a triple-sliced wafer. But this story fails the plausibility test big-time. Shawn Wayne isn't simply a dim bulb. He's beyond clueless. He just ain't for real, and I don't mean ficticious. On the one hand he's astute enough to devise an intricate rating system for women. On the flip side, he's 99% dense on all matters excluding sports. He can recognize a Glock and its specifications, but to him Jesse Jackson is just some guy he saw on cable sports TV. At a Congressional Black Caucus function, Jesse intones, ""Keep hope alive!"" Shawn's response: ""Who the hell is Hope?"" And with its revisionist history, seems ""Beeperless"" tries to create a Black urban Forrest Gump.I want my money back!"
3,Pretty decent,"I read this book and must admit that it took me a while to get into it. i though it was rahter silly at first, but actually it was readable. At first i wasnt into the classification of women either,but actually its probably ore true than false. Overall the book was good, but the ending left me hanging and lookng to see if there was any more pages."
3,Comical; sitcom material,"I thought ""Beeperless"" was hysterical. Those of us with a sense of humor recognize the exaggerations and extremes. For a first effort, I think Mr. Whitfield did a remarkable job in bringing Shawn to life, much like E. Lynn Harris' ""Basil"". For those who didn't enjoy ""Beeperless"", I recommend you give ""Something's Wrong With Your Scale"" a chance. Even though I enjoyed ""Beeperless"", ""Scale"" is much better."
3,"Wow, that boy is slow","I thought this book was extremely funny. I did find it hard to believe that anyone could be that cheap and slow. He seemed to have the mental capacity of Forest Gump. I thought his classification of women was interesting but I was not at all impressed with the ending. I read this book at I read his latest book ""Somethings wrong with you scale"". That book was great and was expecting better but didn't get it."
1,Pass this up and check out Omar Tyree,"This book was horrible. I kept thinking it was going to get better, but it was just silly. I dont want to dog the brother but dont quit your day job. I understand that his new book is really good, but I just dont have the heart to give him one more chance."
5,A GREAT READ FULL OF LAUGHS AND SURPRISES.,"I received this book for Valentine's Day and finished it already. It was fabulous. I could not put it down and thought that it couldn't keep getting funny, but it truly, truly did. I would recommend this book for most anyone (I am a married, white female, so I don't think I fit the demographic) because it is so very well written and the storyline and characters are somewhat universal in their appeal. This is a great read full of hope, energy and promise. I look forward to more work from Mr. Whitfield and hope that he is able to maintain his uncanny sense of style, wisdom and humor."
1,"Sorry, Sorry, sorry","It has been a long time since I have read such a bad book. This book was horrible. I am sure the writer was trying to make his character funny, but all he suceeded in doing was making him stupid and unrealstic.The only good thing that I have to say about this book is that I didn't buy it I borrowed it from the library. Please save your money, and don't buy this book. I like books that are funny, but Van Whitfield is not capable of making a book funny and realistic. All of his characters are too sterotypical and you find yourself saying no one is that stupid. His next book is not any better so save your money on that one also."
1,"Horrible read, don't waste your money","THis book was for those fo us that have dense senses of humor. It wasn't even funny. THe main character, Shawn, was ignorant instead of funny. THe book jumped from scene to scene with no leadway. Dialouge was ridiculous and this rating system of women is dirogatory (but sometimes true). THen the ending leaves you hanging like a leaf in the wind. You never really connect with any of the characters. Stupid, STUPID book. My opinion, is to buy it on audio, maybe it sounds better then it reads!"
2,MORE LIKE MINDLESS...,"Beeperless Remote showcases the work of writer, Van Whitfield. However, I draw the line at referring to his work as anything but mindless minutia. Whitfield's novel is trite and shallow, which is also reflective of the main character, Shaun. I can only say that for the few mini-seconds of guffaws, I felt that I had wasted money purchasing this book. I can only hope that Mr. Whitfield will redeem himself and his writing talent in the very near, and I do mean very near future."
2,Very unrealistic and silly,"I had high hopes for this book based on the title. There are probably 100 good stories out there telling about the antics of a man, his beeper, and meeting women. The character Shawn was so naive that I ( honestly ) thougt maybe he was developmentally disabled. His funniest (and most believeable ) character flaw was his stingyness and how he got by in life. The funniest ( although still unbelievable )part of the book was when he couldn't dress for the black tie occassion, and when the lady at the same gala event flipped her wig ( so to speak ). If you are recovering from surgery( like I was) then this book is good enough to get you through the ordeal."
2,Let's get real!,"This book is filled with many holes. For starters how is it that a person, an African American, living in D.C., would not know Jesse Jackson. Secondly, Mr. Wane's entire basketball career is quite questionable. I mean this is suppose to be fiction, not FANTASY!!! There were just too many distractions in this book that kept me from focusing in on the plot, which once when I found wasn't worth discovering anyway. I think that the idea was a good one, but somewhere between Mr. Wane chasing after Troi and his fairy tales of ""smoking"" the Greatest Player to set foot on a basketball court in the NBA the story totally flopped! Sorry Mr. Wane but your story just doesn't wash. Lets just hope there isn't a sequel to this literary mess."
4,SO UNBELIEVABLE IT CAN ONLY MAKE YOU RELAX & LAUGH!,"LET ME START BY SAYING THAT AS AFRICAN AMERICANS, WE SHOULDLEARN TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE. I GIVE PROPS TO ANYONE WHOPUTS FORTH THE EFFORT, WHILE ALSO PUTTING THEMSELVES OUT THERE TO BE RATED. I MUST SAY THAT THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS BOOK, SHAWN, IS A BIT UNREAL. COME ON NOW....A CLIP ON TIE FOR A BLACK TIE AFFAIR AND SO ON AND SO ON. WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON. EVEN TO OUR MOST SHELTERED PEOPLE CERTAIN THINGS ARE NATURAL. HAVING SAID THAT, I STILL CAN NOT SAY THAT THIS IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. ALTHOUGH I FOUND IT HARD TO BELIEVE, IT KEPT MY INTEREST FOR THE MOST PART."
1,Negative 0 if I could,"This was the worse book I have ever read! Please do not buy this book! This book makes me wanna sue the publisher for passing off this novel as anything but what it should be, liner for a cat's litter box. It is not funny as some people suggest, it is pathetic. There is no way there is a guy out there who can somehow figure out a rating system for woman but doesn't know what a black tire affair is. (He thinks it means he needs to wear a black tie arrgh)Maybe if your I.Q is as high as being legally drunk then you may enjoy this book. I didn't and I will never, NEVER, never buy another book by this author."
5,I don'd remember when I laughed so hard!!,"You know how you watch a comedy and you have to watch over again because you laughed so hard that you missed half of it? That is this book - imagine passages so funny, you have to put down the book and just LAUGH! I mean side splitting, belly holding, snorting as you try to catch your breath (while people around you are sure you have lost your mind) LAUGHTER!!!This is the perfect book to give to your brother, son, uncle - any guy in the dating scene - and, as a female, it is a scream to read about one's self - and all your girlfriends.... here is hoping my number 6 is out there,,, gotta go, sportscenter is on!!!!"
3,Nobody could be that clueless!,"I thought the book was ok. However, nobody could be that clueless. I mean, this guy was out of order. I believe that the sequel will be better. At least I hope so. I can say, the end made you want to run out and get the next book just to see how everything worked out."
3,Clueless,"I finished this book on Sunday and could not wait to write a review. First off, I belive this was a good attempt by Van Whitfield. But he needed to give his character a little more depth. I understand people don't always keep up on the latest slang terms, but this brother was entirely CLUELESS!!! The part about the black tie pissed me off. I thought this character was old enough to know that if a dinner is black tie, it means wear a tux!!! Even the backwoods people know this much. By the end of the book, I was hoping that the author made this guy mentally impaired. That would at least account for some of his dump, stupid actions and comments throughout the book. Although the black tie thing was bad, the condom thing was even worst! Shawn, get a grip. I was actually very angry with this character by the end of the book. I often pass my books along to my friends and family, I wish I could send this one back to Amazon."
2,Maybe it's Just Me,"I'm a 17 year old that likes to be drawn into a book. This book lacks substance. You could say it may because I'm alittle old for fairy tales but in every description I read they swear the book is for children and adults alike. Uh, I'd have to disagree.- The stories are so predictable (as in it follows the exact plot of the story that we've heard since we alittle listened to our parents) a.k.a. It doesn't bring anything new to the story.....or- It's based on a folklore I've never heard of and in effect the message of the tales fall flat.The only reason I'm keeping the book is for when I have kids a long way down the road I can pick a few of the stories out to read to them. That is, only SOME of the stories are even really appropriate to read to a child.This book is okay, but doesn't deserve as much hype as the introduction and translator give it."
4,Ying Yang In This Thang,"This cd is pretty tight, except for the fact that it has one song,(Whistle While You Twurk) four different times, but I actually like them all. Some other songs that I like are Ying Yang In This Thang and Bring Yo Azz Outdoz. Another song that caught my attention but I don't think some people don't like it is the last song... Back Up! Anyways I would have given this cd a 5 star but that fact about one song being remixed 3 different times just doesn't catch my fancy. But all these songs bump if you gotta good stereo system. -Infa"
1,Wack part II,"should of written these years ago. They are wack, plain and simple. If it's on MTV or VH1, you know it's commercial. They can't rap, they are just another of the Down south's ABC rappers."
3,I Appreciate this read,"I think it was a great idea for the author to open up the world of her first year of teaching to the public. We all know there aren't enough useful publications for us music teachers.I was a little disappointed after reading this book. Though Bell does touch on lots of topics like maintaining a personal life, dealing with parents and fundraisers, I expected to take more away from it. It was a quick read, mostly because of its journal style--separated by months. I wanted more advice as I'm approaching my first year of teaching. I've found many other of the books in this category had more information to take away from them. This one had potential, but never really took off.I credit Bell for sharing her thoughts and feelings, and would like to see a sequel with more information to be taken from it.Until then, I would recommend this as a quick read, but be prepared that there aren't any fireworks or epiphanies."
5,can we go better than 5 stars,"this is another absolutely perfect, over built, amazing piece of engineering. it works flawlessly, bolts on easily, and works amazingly well. shortcomings? nearly none. the only two questionable points are that the slide comes within a millimeter of hitting the 4"" dust collector hose attached to an adapter used on the fence dust collector port, and the slide when rotated out of the way interferes with the fence screw down handles a bit, and most notably the most distal end of the slide rests on the table and catches the edge of the acrylic height adjustment window slightly as you slide it across the table of the mast r excel table. a great product that makes routing perpendicular work a snap."
2,Probably Not for Christians,"I believe Christian readers should be cautious of this translation and would be better served by the fine edition by Kieran Kavanaugh and Otillo Rodriguez (ISBN-10: 0809122545) that is part of the Classics of Western Spirituality by Paulist Press.Kavanaugh and Rodriguez are Disclaced Carmelites, so that, among other things, their edition potentially represents a direct-lineage link to the spirituality of St. Teresa of Avila."
5,The Interior Castle,"St. Teresa of Avila does an outstanding--and remarkably contemporary--job of reviewing the journey toward spiritual maturity. Her insightful analysis provides a map for pilgrims, outlining both the rewards and difficulties encountered as we travel. For those serious about spiritual formation, Teresa of Avila's book is a ""must."""
1,Mirabai Starr not qualified to translate this wonderful work,"I was thoroughly disappointed in Mirabai Starr's translation. Her inability to comprehend Catholic Theology is evident throughout this translation; as a Catholic, I take offense at her politically correct terminology. When you change the term ""mortal sin"" to ""grave error"" and ""sin"" to ""missing the mark"" for fear of hurting someone's feelings, something is lost in the translation and you have missed the mark (pun intended). I intend to purchase a copy of this wonderful work, but it will be one that is translated by a Catholic scholar that isn't interested in political correctness."
5,interior castle,wonderful account of a 14th century nun's exploration of the soul and of man's connection to God. well written and still relevant.
4,The Interior Castle,"Recommended by a long-lost, dear friend. I hadn't realized what a mystic Teresa was. A new dimension to this beloved saint. Simply wonderful!"
1,The translator got in the way,"I have wanted to read works of Teresa of Avila for many years. She is quoted by many of my favorite authors. However, after 100 pages, I can go no further in this book. The translator clearly views things differently than the author and she changes words and phrases to fit her own viewpoint. In her introduction she describes these changes so the reader is warned. I've decided that I'd rather read a more accurate interpretation. For starters, it would help if the Christian references to God and Satan were kept. Then as a reader I can ""modernize"" what I need to in my own head."
5,A beautiful book on the journey of a soul,"St.Theresa of Avila is one of my favorite authors. She has so much insight to offer us. This book compares the soul to a castle with different rooms, which she calls mansions. Each mansion is a different stage of the soul on it's journey toward God. St. Theresa talks about seven mansions. As the soul passes from one mansion to the next the soul progresses toward God more completely. Theresa explains in each stage what is lacking and what we can to do to reach the next stage. I feel this book offers many valuable insights to help us on our journey toward God."
2,Caution! A Bowdlerized Interior Castle,"I have no problem with the original Author of this book in the substance of her writing. But the translator, Mirabai Starr, does a great deal of bowdlerization throughout the book. She replaces the word ""sin"" with words such as ""limitation"" or ""unconciousness"", thereby changing the meaning of St. Teresa's prose.If you want a more faithful translation, I suggest you do not look at this particular book."
5,great spiritual book,This is a fantastic work that merits reading. The book was written by someone who clearly understands the nature of the Soul and the subtlties of it in union with God. I believe that anyone from nearly any spiritual tradition could benefit from the material in it. The experiences of which are written are difficult to communicate but Teresa of Avila does quite well and the book should be helpful to anyone whom has also experienced the Soul in this way. I've found it helpful to read such books to aid understanding of the Soul(and God) and in the practicing of religion.
5,ONLY FOR ESSAY READERS,"This is mystical theology. If are a researcher like I am, this is an awesome book"
4,Off the beaten path,Classic literature from the 16th Century. Teresa describes the journey toward the center of our soul and God. I would hope that our journey toward the Divine does not digress as much as Teresa does in her description of the journey.
1,Closer to God,"I bought this book for a class I had to take in college. I found it in credibly boring and a very difficult read. It is all about some lady who gets a crazy vision and talks to Jesus. She goes on and on about Jesus and how great he is. It's Jesus this, Jesus that. I do not recommend ever looking at this page on Amazon any more than you have too this book was so bad. Unless you're a Jesus freak who goes to church 6 times a day and prays for guidance for every move you make, then, I highly recommend this book. You will love it and I will hate you."
4,Journey Of A Soul,"""Interior Castle"" is St. Theresa of Avila's classical guide to spiritual perfection. Although written to her Sixteenth Century sisters in the Carmelite order, it is readily understandable by contemporary readers.The premise behind the book is that the road to spiritual perfection consists of passage through seven mansions. The last mansion is the Interior Castle in which God dwells. In each succeeding mansion the soul reaches a higher level of sanctity and the attachment to the world decreases as the soul comes closer to God.Although some portions of the book describe experiences beyond the expectations of modern readers, this work still provides us all with an insight into a way to draw closer to God. While this book does not provide us with the only route to Heaven, I recommend it to all who are searching for guidance in their spiritual journey"
2,Quick and easy.,Nice thermometer. Cover protects it when it's in my utensil drawer. The temp is clockwise of the red mark. Easy.
1,Worse then useless,"First, take a close look at the readout.Now, what is 160deg? Is it the black line, or the red line? Not too sure? OK, well let's start at 0 and go up the dial. Well, zero is a red mark so it's even, right? And the next large black mark is 10, good so far... 20 is red...30.. 40.. 50.. huh? wait now 60 is black? What the....???So, basically, the readout is worse then useless, the last thing anyone needs is an ambiguous temp read on their meat thermometer."
5,This is a deal!,"I used to be the only one I knew who loved this candy, then eventually my wife grew to love them also... We started calling them ""Vitamin G"" way back in the early 90's, but then my youngest daughter came along and she is also an addict!But here's the deal, I grew up loving the hard stale Good and Plenty that came out of the ""Choo Choo Charley"" boxes, but once I stated buying the 7 ounce bags and got fresh Good and Plenty, I grew to even love it more. Here on Amazon is about as good of a deal as you are likely to find at about $1.40 bag it is less than I can find at even the discount grocery stores where freshness is hit and miss."
2,Tasty but won't eat unless they change the coloring,"This is my favorite candy but I found out they use cochineal for the pink coloring. Cochineal are beetles scraped from cacti, dried and crushed. I don't eat food with bugs in it. It's a shame they don't change it because these are SO delicious."
4,Dance for the dubba-00s,"This is jittery, crack-fueled, short-attention spank funk for the dance floor. This hews very closely to the original vision of disco originated by Cerrone and Giorgio Moroder before marketing people saw the need for it to be a star driven, packaged product.This is NOT a record for people who like ""songs"". In other words, 3-minute, easily lovable dance-pop with singers, a bridge, chorus, break, etc. This is unique, at times difficult, but always ingratiating music. Justice is here, so that should give you an idea of what to expect."
4,great display of ed banger,"this is a great display of the new french electronic scene, under Ed Banger's flag. Justice and Busy P headline this infectious beats music and porttraits a fresh and new scene, pretty much influenced by guy homem christo /daft punk fathers. GREAT ALBUM for a trashy party"
2,Rook for younger players?,"I was looking for a game that would help teach younger kids how to play Rook without all of the complicated rules. While this game is somewhat simpler than Rook, it actually is harder to play for anyone that already knows how to play Rook. While the game itself isn't that bad, it's in no way a replacement for the tradional game of Rook."
1,A total Steal!,"This is a total steal, it's made of cheap plastic, and it doesn't really diffuse a lot of light, when shooting portraits you can't tell the difference unless you are shooting close-ups and even then it's a harsh light. Probably a price of 9.99 would be fine, but it's like 7 times that price. You are better off not using anything to diffuse, bouncing or a DIY softbox. I've had it for over 6 months and doesn't get much use (i just use it because it was too expensive to just throw it away).It is not worth getting it."
3,Emilienne,We didn't stay with it to the end!! You really have to be into nudity to make it through this. We like more story content.
3,La Cicuta perdio La Sustancia,I purchased this CD for 2 deserving danzones: Cicuta Tibia and Sustancia. Paquito's rendition is pitiful compared to the orignal by Enemelio Jimenez with the Ernesto Duarte orchestra. He chooses to play these beatufil solos completely straight and this drains the flavor off these numbers.
3,Nice but not great,"Great for powering 1st generation iPod Shuffle... but not enough Amps to power generic USB devices. Basically, it's a trickle charger so when I hooked up my Motorola cell phone, which is powered by USB, it didn't reach the power threshold in order to signal to the phone that it was to charge. Great folding-prongs design and white chassis provides superb camouflage if stored in a bucket of ice cubes."
1,Not what's pictured. not the original square lollipop!,new round lollipops not the same taste. very bland.advice: go back to square lollipops.
1,ITEM NOT AS PICTURED OR LISTED,"ITEM IS LISTED AND SHOWN AS SQUARE POPS....ARRIVED AS ""ROUND"".AND I BOUGHT 12 BAGS NOT REAL HAPPY."
2,Where are the square ones????,"Where are the square pops shown on the package? Bring them back. They were better. And no cherry flavored in 2 of the bags! Get it together, Hersheys."
3,Not quite as.....,"tasty as the original sticks, but still good. They are a little different than original. Kind of cloudy looking, not clear."
4,pure blast beating heaven,"divine rapture cook up there own brand of technical death metal with the burning passion, this cd is great for anyone who likes there death metal from bands like, deeds of flesh, hate eternal, and origin, now that leads us to sound quality everyone says it blows but i can think of three things worse, morbid angels heretic, mithras worlds beyond the veil and anything recorded by the band darkthrone, so there are worse things out there the songwriting and musicianship is focused and tight throughout and this disc is a great addition to any fan of death metals cd collection"
3,Those who don't remember the past......,"Overall, this is not a bad account, the only minor complaints are some inconsistencies (one section deals with Khallid Muhammad;s death and later in the book, White speculates on Khallid as a future NOI leader) and some historical errors here and there. That aside, White's description of the NOI (an organization which, as a believer in the brotherhood of humanity, I personally have little regard for), makes it clear that little has changed in this organization since Malcolm X (wisely) left it in the 1960s in regards to it's exploitation of angry, confused, and disfranchised Blacks. Some better editing would improve the book, but it's core lesson should be heeded to potential converts to groups like the NOI-""Those who don't remember the past are condemned to repeat it."""
2,The Truth Is Still Out There,"Only Mr. White knows the validity of his personal experiences inside the Nation of Islam. However, anytime I am troubled by something Minister Farrakhan allegedly said, I attempt to obtain the video of the actual speech. Copies of most speeches are available via the internet. Time and time again, the Minister has proven he is not the vicious racist the media claims him to be.Mr. White's book is full of the same half truths, one sided accounts, and statements taken out of context, which have been attributed to Minister Farrakhan for over 20 years.If you want to know what Mr. White claims Farrakhan said , buy this book. If you want to know what Farrakhan said, visit the Nation of Islam's website."
1,Don't waste your money,"There is nothing in this book that you can't get from any free internet site on job search and interview help. I have interviewed microsoft and know of others who have interviewed Microsoft, some work there some don't. Nothing in the book helped my experience with MSFT and nothig will help anyone else either. If you buy this book you will be wasting your money. As far as the interview with Microsoft it can be said in one sentence. BE YOURSELF. If they like you they hire you if they don't they won't. It's mostley a beauty pagent and each set of interviewer will have his/her notion of who they want to hire. DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK."
1,OH NO SHE DID UNT . . .,"This book is utter crap. Uninteresting and with no redeeming quality what so ever.War, social and political polorization, environmental crime, natrual disasters by the dozens, political corruption in historic dementions, political parties that are completely out of touch . . . WE GOT PROBLEMS. And all poor Kate has to add is plain old fashioned HATE.She is part of the problem, cares not for solutions, and is only interteresed in pleasing others like herself. Rich, white, hateful USERS.My advice to Katie, DRINK MORE, SMOKE MORE, PLAY MORE GOLF and stop trying to write."
1,[...],"I wonder, I really do.Here it is again, more or less. This book is another in a series of conservative chop-shop productions. It takes a few anecdotes out of context,uses them to stand for ""feminism,"" and then spooks the far right with visions of how this imaginary group is ruining everything. It's cheap, intellectually shoddy, and very familiar."
1,Utter tripe,"Hm, I see the conservos are massing to defend one of their vicious poster girls. How interesting, in view of just how shoddy this book is. O'Bierne, however, shares with her husband Joe ""Screw Iraq, it's about the Repubbies"" O'Bierne one key scruple: loyalty to one's own, rather than to anything that might be loosely called accuracy. The book is cribbed from conservative souces, half quotes, and sheer fantasy, much the way the husband in the partnership tossed aside concerns about reality and hired instead exclusively Republican candidates for key positions in Coalition Provisional Authority. Look it up; you'll see. Loyalty to the party is all that matters to the repubs. O'Bierne is just the latest in a long line of Republican she-pundits who've made selling out the highest form of prostitution there is."
1,Shall We dance AGAIN,"Kate wants us to start our dance of the seven veils one more time. She doesn't like how or why we got here. Thus she suggests all the progress made (by and with the help 0f) these Worse ever women be erased because she wans to call strikes not balls. Come on Kate want to start washing clothes with a wooden washboard? want to not be able to vote? want to stay home and not make that paycheck on your blah blah talk shows??Give us all a break/ You know what you are saying and why!!!Woman will continue to move forward no thanks to woman like you, Your philosophy of I got mine now you go get yours is what is Worse and Radical!!!!!Schools? Remember men only college? Families? Remember when women stayed home and knew their place??Military? Remember the women who have died fighting for their country?????????? Sports? I'll g o way back Remember The Babe who exceled at any sport she ever played and thrilled the world????? Why do you hate women?"
1,Shooting the Messenger,"Another Right-wing hit piece on progressive policies that is big on supposition, with little or no factual basis. Ms O'Beirne would like to blame progressive women for everything from Iraq casualties to Global Warming. In her opinion, women belong in the kitchen, raising children and being obeidient to their male superiors.In short, its complete garbage."
1,"1 Hollow Star, That Is",Ugly and disgusting. Can we move forward instead of backwards? O'Bierne would prefer the dark ages. What a rat.
1,Hate Mongering,"Not only is this book poorly written and poorly edited, it is poorly argued and poorly designed. (And I won't even touch the appallingly offensive cover which I presume was designed by someone other than Ms. O'Beirne--caricature much?) I'm always ready for an actual, honest debate, but this is rank demigoguery--the 'author' refuses to actually engage with the substance of her topic (feminism), instead detailing straw argument after straw argument, knocking each down. Too bad most of those argument have very little to do with feminisms, it's importance, or the gains it has secured for women. [And boy are these *tired* old caricatures!]There are, moreover, scads of simple errors of fact. Only one example: have you ever *seen* Germaine Greer, Mr. O'Beirne? She is one gorgeous girl!Worthless drivel. [Wish I could give it zero stars!]"
1,why the anger?,"As I read the book I couldn't help but think, why the anger? I would recommend Ms. O'Beirne read, 'I'm OK, you're OK', by Thomas Harris. In my earliest years (southern Baptist) I was taught god = love, or in common parlance, ""love makes the world go round"". Hey, Kate, where's the love?"
1,Hatred Is Not A Family Value,"Kate O'Beirne's position that feminists who speak in favor of equality for women are ruining cultural institutions is preposterous and dangerous. Any thoughtful, spiritual reader can see that this writer is offering up another helping of hatred disguised as a meaningful contribution to the public discourse. Do not believe everything that you see in print, and for heaven's sake, don't believe this! May our higher powers save us from such evil people and their venomous vomit."
5,This book explains a lot,"This is a very interesting book. It explains a lot about our society and how it change by women who have an agenda and want to destroy the family, and our society as we know it.The author goes into interesting details about some of the women's upbringing and past that shed light on why they promote and come up with such angry and vicious ideas towards family and everything that society sees as being worthy.This book will open your eyes."
1,...or so the Republicans want you to believe!,To bad I had to give one star. This book is a radical assault on my intelligence. If you are a white male born 1870 you might enjoy this book.
5,"Way to tell it like it is, Kate!","I enjoyed reading this book very much. Kate O'Beirne has the guts to tell this story and rattle some cages. She provides hard facts and good data to support her position and she does it with a great sense of humor that had me laughing through many chapters. She is right on when she says that the radical feminist agenda is severely damaging our education system, corporate America, sports and our family structure as we know it. I will definitely pass this book along to friends and family who, I hope, will enjoy it as much as I did. Keep up the good work, Kate!! Our side needs a strong voice to go up against the whiny, shrill, obnoxious voices of the feminist left."
1,"This is why all radicals, left and right, make trouble...","Here is yet another radical on the right-wing attacking radicals on the left-wing. How original. Or not.Here is a cheerful thought. Stop trying to tell everyone what to do - left wing radicals stop trying to force all women into narrow-minded careerist lives, and right wing radicals like Kate stop trying to force women to be narrow-minded homemakers. Just stop. That's it. Stop. Let everyone live their life as they see fit, whether it be as a homemaker or as a career woman without a family. This is called choice. Everyone deserves to make their own. This is why radicals screw up the world."
5,Definitive Book about trouble for women,This book explains why women have not advanced faster in our society. It is well written and well reasoned and backed up by compelling facts by someone very knowledgeable about the national political and cultural scene. Highly recommended boo for all young women to know what to avoid.
1,Fear and loathing,"After reading this book you won't learn anything about feminists or any of the women mentioned in the book. You will learn a great deal about Kate O'Beirne. The portrait of her emerging from this book is not pretty. This woman has a truly ugly soul. She is filled with fear and loathing.Another thing; her obsession with Sex and the City as well as lesbianism is telling. Kate O'Beirne has some serious ""issues"".It is not feminists who are destroying the US military. It is the Bush administration. He has weakened our military to the point of putting troops in harms way without body armour. What is the point of mentioning facts though? O'Beirne is not interested in facts. She has open contempt for reason and empirical evidence. She relies on assertion and lies.This book is strictly for those who believe the earth is flat, up is down, war is peace."
1,"Go Home and Bake Me A Pie, Ms. O'Beirne","This, like Bernard Goldberg's ""Hundred People Who are Screwing Up America"", is another book in which the writer projects his or her own negative attributes onto others. Of course, the real people ""Screwing Up America"" and ""Mak[ing] the World Worse"" are the people who make lists of others they feel are doing so. Three cheers for irony.What I find disturbing is that this is a woman arguing that women should be subservient to men, and that every advancement that's come about to further sexual equality is somehow an atrocity. This unnamed cousin to Stockholm Syndrome seems to run rampant among the women of the current brand of conservatives in the Republican party. Imagine a slave in the 1800s begging for heavier shackles.I guess the most repugnant thing about this book, though, is that she attacks feminism while at the same time benefiting from it at, what, [...]? Doesn't she know women shouldn't be writing in the first place? Or attending Princeton?"
2,Enough already,"I may be one of the few reviewers here who's actually read this book. Basically I'm a Kate fan. I think she's a bright, articulate lady and much of that comes through in this book. But I have to honestly say I'm just about burned out on these gimmicky books about the 10 or 20 or 100 people who are ruining the world, America, our families, the military...whatever. I really think everyone from Kate to Anne Coulter to Mick Savage to Sean has just gone to this well once too often, and frankly sometimes I think they're only doing it for my money. America's hurting, people. I think all reasonable people can agree on that. Right about now I'm wishing I'd spent my $[...] trying to relieve some of that hurt rather than contributing to this ridiculous, never ending left-right food fight."
4,Very good book from a service member in Iraq,I am glad I bought this book for my clear thinking friend who has a Womens Studies degree. I think she will like it and find it a fair critique of modern feminism. O'Beirne's argument is based on outcomes as opposed to ideology. I read it first and found it very well researched (just look in the back for the annotations) and is not a religously oriented book.The Chapter about Women serving bravely in the armed forces was particularly relevant to me as our unit has received its first KIAs last week here in Iraq. One of them was a female.This book is eye opening and seeks to interpret the statistical facts about men and women in American society.
4,expanding the horizons of the womens movement,The O'beirne book adds important information to the womens' movement. This information supports women who value themselves and their roles in society in relationship to others and to God. Radical Feminists are one sided and do not support women with whom they disagree. This book is important to read for people searching for a broader view in relation to the womens' movement. Reading this book encourages others to look for role models of outstanding women who live their lives serving others.
1,Dreadful hypocrisy,"I gradually moved from disturbed to appalled to simply outraged. This foolish person can pander to the radical right as a direct result of the efforts of the people she has the gall to attack.People like this are the precursors of lunatics like the taliban, facilitators and apologists of lifestyles that belong in the middle ages or in a bedouin tent.I hated this book, and I now despise it's author."
1,contradiction?,"The chinese philospher Mencius once said: ""Why I dislike holding to one point is that it injures the tao. It takes up one point and disregards a hundred others.""What's become a detriment to our society is that words like ""feminist"" and ""liberal"" have become nasty words when really what they stand for is open-mindedness, the soul of Mencius' quote above. Ms. O'Beirne, may I remind you that without feminism you would not have been able to publish this very book."
1,This crack needs to get laid,"This is the worst POS I have seen in years. This book will only appeal to the kool-aid drinkin right wingers who need this kind of garbage to get it or keep it up. If you are narrow minded, white trash or live in a trailer, this book is for you."
1,awful antifeminist trash,"Kate O'Beirne should be thanking feminists for advancing her ability to attend prestigious schools and get taken seriously as an opinionmaker. Instead she attacks them and seems to be advocating for a kinder, gentler America when women were subservient in all things. No thanks."
1,Typical conservative hit-job,"Ill-researched and wildly inaccurate. If your ideal woman is barefoot and pregnant, you'll love it."
4,Reviews brought me to this book.,"With all of the traffic on message boards and blogs along with the reviews here on Amazon, I had to go out and buy this book at Borders. Sorry Amazon but I couldn't wait for even your two day shipping.Was I impressed? Really, I don't know what all of the bad reviews signify since this book seems to be fairly straight-forward. I won't comment on most of the facts the author presents since I haven't researched most of them myself. Having said that, I will say that the few items that I have experience with are accurate.Buy the book yourself or better yet get it from the library, read it and then decide for yourself if the author makes a valid case. [...]Recommended? Yes, with a few reservations."
2,Same old stuff -- boring,Anyone reasonably engaged in current events these last ten years will not find much interesting or new in this book.
3,I don't really have an opinion,"Because I haven't read this book. But after reading all the 1 star reviews from the lock-step lefties, I definitely plan to!"
1,Well Researched?,"I am a very happy wife and mother, with fairly conservative views. As someone who's career is in research, I am disgusted with what others are considering ""well researched"". The author has taken facts and twisted to her own advantage, and to the disservice of women. The ""supporting facts"" in the book are as comical as the cover. This author attempts to make a few good points, but then ruins her concepts with overwhelming bias."
1,Women Who Make the World Worse,"O'Beirne has shown her petticoats as a reactionary. This book is ugly, scary, and contributes to the general assault by the Right on women's rights that enlightened women have worked toward for generations."
5,"Examples, Please?","Could just one of you 1-star deep thinkers cite at least one objectionable passage along with your stunning refutation? (include page reference , please)"
5,Digital Book-Burning by Radical Feminists,"It's interesting to watch the digital book-burning engaged in by petulant leftists who can't abide a truly intelligent woman like Kate O'Beirne (as opposed to the NOW/NARAL hags who keep regurgitating '60s nonsense about the ""slavery of marriage and motherhood"") towing anything but the radical feminist party line.Maybe Rush Limbaush was correct in referring to them as ""Feminazis""."
1,More Right vs Left Nonsense,"A load of B.S. Another attempt to place labels on folks, slander the side that doesn't agree with a narrow agenda, and impose a belief system on those with a different opinion. I say we wiretap her phone for a while. I'm sure she wouldn't mind."
1,Another right wing hachet job,Total waste of money. An ugly duck complaining about women who are out in the world living full lives and expressing their freeedom of choice. Her writing is full of (not so) repressed resentment over beautiful and/or talented woman succeeding in a man's world.
2,Cherry picking and extremists on both sides,I have to give her 2 stars just for the work she did - but just by 'Googling' her sources and the other research in those areas you can find data contrary to what is presented in her book.As far as the content and style....I found myself agreeing with her views more in some chapters more than others. At times I found her tone as preachy as the radical fems she rails against - very generalizing and almost shrill which was a big turn-off for me as a reader.I was hoping this would help with a real discussion on what feminism is and it's place in 2005/6 but it fell short of my expectations. Extremists on BOTH sides of the topics covered are the outliers...the truth may lie in the middle - but that doesn't sell many books does it?
1,Amazing,"After reading this book I find it amazing that O'Beirne would write a book so degrading that I had to write a review and, perhaps, give a history lesson for Ms. O'Beirne and anyone who thought this book was above one star.""Radical"" feminism is the reason why O'Beirne has the skills (reading and writing) to pen this disgusting and hypocritical book. ""Radical' feminism is the reason why O'Beirne can vote for the racist idiots she endorses on the FOX Republican News Station. ""Radical"" feminism is the reason why O'Bierne has the abiltiy to earn the profits from this book. ""Radical"" feminism gave O'Beirne the ability to write this book in the first place without the assistance and approval of a male guardian. Should I go on???? All of theses rights, that we as women take for granted now, were ""radical"" at the time of implimentaion.WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!!!"
3,"Good, not great","Certainly not the most exciting read ever, but the book does take aim at some well-deserved targets. Radical feminism is doing the country harm and deserves scorn. Some, though not all, of the chapters were right on. I disagree with O'Beirne on the abortion issue, for example, but she does a good job of exposing Title IX's unfairness.Unfortunately,O'Beirne writes in a fairly boring manner. Another author could have turned this into 4 or 5 star book. Still worth reading."
5,"Well-written, factual and a testament to the damange Feminism is doing to our society","Kate O'Beirne has given readers an insight into what Feminism is actually doing to our culture. In a word, ruining it. There are no hateful diatribes or attacks on the feminist leaders in this country, there is just example after example of how feminism is malevolently affecting our schools, our military, our sports, and our marriages. Feminism has eroded and overcome the facts of biology. Men and women are different, biologically, emotionally, physically, and those differences should be celebrated not exterminated. Ms. O'Beirne herself is a testament to what a modern day woman should be; she is confident, intelligent and ambitious but also is family-oriented and proud of her role as a woman and all that may entail. This book is an honest look at feminism's effect on this Country. If anyone is interested in this topic, this book is a must read."
5,Common Sense Wins the Day!,This book is very straightforward and very clear. My daughters and I have all enjoyed it. The current generation of young women is at best confused but more often repelled by the current feminist leadership. Where is the commitment to truth? Feminism is saddled with too much ideology and can no longer connect to reality. This book makes its case.
5,"""Feminism"" Exposed","Finally a straightforward expose of the hypocrisy of the ""feminist"" movement and the truth about the extreme leftist political agenda that is the actual basis for this ""movement""."
3,"Yes, very interesting","This is a book that all women should read and try to read with an open mind. Obviously, it draws a line through political affiliations. [...] I thinks she is right in most of what she says. This coming from me, an executive level professional, 32 year fulltime professional white collar employee. Read it and make your own judgment. I found it refreshingly honest and most certainly true about our society today."
3,"A Serious, Scholarly Work","This is a thoughtful, scholarly, well-researched series of essays.The subtitle, properly and accurately using the terms ""radical,"" ""assault,"" and ""ruining,"" clearly demonstrate the serious nature and balanced intent of this work.Also, the cover's caricatures of Clinton, Streisand, and their ilk.However, I must reduce the rating to a middling ""three,"" [...] I was disappointed the book didn't include the actual feminist agenda. I can't seem to find a copy of it anywhere, and, if a book like this has no CD, appendix, or even handy tear-out page with the America-haters' own words, it is difficult to justify its cost."
5,Great book - Great price - Buy it and get educated,"I just finished it and can't say enough positive things about it. So I'll use the bullet format.* Explains why the Democrats have made a major blunder by becoming the women's party.* Explains why Title IX is an out and out farce.* Explains why candidates who wholeheartedly support abortion are out of the mainstream.* Explains why NOW is out of the mainstream.[...] It's not negative. It's not hate filled. It's not a put down of women.It's an honest look at women who are so focused on one issue and one issue alone that they are actually harming their own movement, and the world as a result."
1,Woman-Hating Garbage,"Don't bother with this trash. Just read ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" by Margaret Atwood. That's the world people like O'Beirne are trying to create."
5,Concise and Factual!,I have really enjoyed this book. She is very clear and factual! It is great to get the facts without a feminist twist to it!
5,Great read my top 5 list,This book is a great read for everyone that's seeking the truth about feminism and how you can make a better life for yourself and others
5,Need more women who look at the bigger picture,This book seems very neccesary in the times we are living in and the consquences of forcing sameness of men and women in the competitive world we live in.
4,Worth reading although I can't say that I agree with everything between the covers here,"I enjoyed reading this book for a number of reasons. The first of which is that while I enjoy Ann Coulter's sense of humor, trudging through one of her books is becoming difficult due to all of the invectives which she feels she must add to every sentence. Ms. O'Beirne on the other hand, while also being very well researched, takes a more direct yet eloquent means of laying out her case on why she believes what she does. [...]"
1,No hope for this one,The only way this book will sell is if the publisher works a scheme like the scientologists do with Dianetics!
3,"Ok conservative book, some good info","Women Who Make the World Worse by Kate O'Beirne isn't quite as good. I learned a great deal about Title IX and how college sports are suffering from the quota system, but it's not surprising, everything suffers from the quota system. O'Beirne suffers from the occasional name-calling, but for the most part her book is solid. It'll make you frustrated with these women, but not angry enough to do anything about it. She brings up some good points about equal salary information, but much of this info can be found in other books. Instead, read Shut Up and Sing by Laura Ingraham."
4,quite a good book...,"I was impressed with the amazimg amount of research that went in to this book. It is very good reading, helpful and informative. I enjoyed this book."
1,An excellent argument for high acid-content paper,"because then this drek will turn into cellulose powder that much faster.Please don't waste your money on this shrill, undocumented package of lies. It only encourages them!"
1,Very Poorly Written,Don't waste your money on this garbage! Wanted to rate this book 0 stars but was unable to since the rating scale would not allow it. Women like this author do make the world worse.
1,asdf,"Having wasted time on this book that O'Beirne feels would be better spent barefoot & pregnant, let me be brief.If author(ess) O'Beirne had practiced ""do as I DO, not do as I say,"" her book might be read as a criticism of feminism by one of the more bitter beneficiaries.However, O'Beirne is proud to be a card carrying member of the fearful (unlike any true conservative or liberal American with memory of actual history.)So, she bears the hypocrisy flag with great fanfare and even greater paucity of insight; decrying feminism, for without such a ladder the climb to her very own bully pulpit would have been far, far out of her reach."
1,Utter Nonsense,"This isn't worth the paper it is printed on. If women wish to be subserviant to the males in this world, they should stay at home and not bother with writing books or campaigning to keep them in power."
1,Shanty and Lace Curtain Irish,"Kate O'Beire's latest 'book' is proof positive that hope springs eternal if you're a no class lass. Kate needs to practice what she preaches in this screed and go home and bake some scones and wash some floors, not collect a big 'man-sized' pay check for a position poorly reasoned to satisfy her rightwing NeoCon Man Masters in the Literary Industrial Complex. Her position in this book reminds me of the legion of closeted gay GOP politicans who constantly pass repressed, hate filled judgements on homosexuals (and spiteful laws), while secretly being what they most despise in life.Ms O'Beirne's self-loathing of herself and strong thoughtful women leaps from the pages like someone who has lit her hair on fire and then trys to put it out with a hammer.The Lace Curtain Lady sounds as if she is dispensing missives and imagined wisdom to the pitiful Shanty Towne Chattel of the delicate sex who should be grateful for her Pious Prattle."
1,Focussed on trivialities,"This book isn't much different in content from her TV appearances. There's alot of snark but not much substance. I have to say that anyone who rails at a sit-com because it doesn't have the stereotypes she would prefer, like clearly defined gender roles and restricted sexual expression in women, is wasting everyones time and money. Too bad there's no zero star.[...]"
3,"Amusing, but not Guest's best","""For Your Consideration"" is amiable and amusing, but is not laugh-out-loud funny. The cast is spectacular, and includes Christopher Guest's regulars, foremost among them Jane Lynch and Fred Willard. If you liked ""Best of Show,"" ""Waiting for Guffman"" or Guest's other work, you'll find this movie at least OK. It's amusing, but generally is not a laugh-out-loud funny comedy.As with any of Guest's films, there is far more footage shot than is actually used; it's the nature of the improv-based movie that it is assembled in the editing room afterward more than written beforehand. So, it's not surprising that there are 30 minutes of deleted scenes. What is surprising is what was left out of the movie. I laughed more at the first 10 minutes of deleted scenes than I did at the rest of the movie. A few different editing choices would have made this a much funnier movie."
3,For Your Consideration=disappointment,"As a Christopher Guest fan, For Your Consideraion proved a disappointment because many of the lines were clearly in-jokes that required a lot of knowledge of Hollywood and the procedures and madness that go into making a film and having it be nominated for an Oscar. With the earlier films, i.e. Guffman, Best in Show and A Mighty Wind, the humor was more accessible to the average viewer (the outsider). Also there seemed to be a cruel tone to this film that wasn't present in the others. In the earlier movies the main players were part of the fun; in this one they are the joke. I think Guest is a genius and usually sees human frailty with a kinder eye than this movie revealed. This was more like a Count Rugan film."
3,Not Mr. Guest's best,"While there are a few yucks, BIG yucks, in this movie, it's not Christopher Guest's best. If you've already seen ""Waiting for Guffman,"" ""A Mighty Wind,"" ""Best in Show,"" and ""This is Spinal Tap"" your expectations are high. This movie does not deliver, although Catherine O'Hara's performance is worth the price. But stick around for added features with the monkey puppet."
1,The sound track was out of sync,I am a huge Christopher Guest fan so I have all of his movies and I bought this to round out the set. I was greatly disappointed because the soundtrack was sadly out of sync. I saw the original in a theater and this was not Guest's intention.
3,It's okay....,"Not up to par with Guest's other films. If you haven't seen em, GO RENT ""Waiting for Guffman,"" ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" and ""A Mighty Wind"" in that order. Maybe it'll be better upon a second viewing. But for now, it's just okay for Christopher Guest.On the other hand, Guest can play more characters well than any other actor in Hollywood and he's my fav comedic actor."
3,A Miss,"I really love Christopher Guest's work. This might be a nice effort for someone else, this quirkly little movie falls far short of his other efforts such as Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, and a Mighty Wind. This film is less a mockumentary, and more of a backstage peek at how actors take the Oscars way too seriously. The same basic zany cast is here for this one, and they do there best with the material. There is some decent satire, and a good joke or two, but for the most part it does not work all that well. It especially pales when put up against his other work. I would say to certainly watch this movie, but put off buying it until you have given it a rental."
3,GUEST STARS,"Small budget 'art film' gets Oscar buzz in this Christopher Guest, (Best of Show, Waiting for Guffman), comedy vehicle with Guest's familiar cast of superficial, comic players including Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard, and Parker Posey. It all gets a little too menial for me; the sharp sarcastic and nasty Hollywood characterizations, the light sitcom-y touch, and lack of emotional depth are affronted by Guest's sudden and genuine picture of decadence in the form of Hollywood players falling to the bottom rungs of stardom. Lots of sly little laughs and keen satirical observations on celebs like Regis Philbin, Charlie Rose, and Anna Nicole Smith, but it's still essentially the same movie as Guest's ""Waiting For Guffman"", which lampooned community theatre. The deleted scenes seem on par to anything in the final cut, and one; Catherine Ohara's response to Oscar mention on a morning news show, is the comedic jewel of the entire package."
2,Guest Disappoints For The First Time,"I'ma HUGE Christopher Guest fan! Two of my favorite all-time movies are Waiting For Guffman and Best In Show. However, For Your Consideration didn't seem to live up to my expectations. I actually found the deleted scenes funnier than the movie itself. I hope this is just a lull in their film-making. The seemed to have left the whole mockumentary formula with this one and some of the things just weren't funny. I hope they rebound with their next film!Tom"
3,Not Guest's best,"Definitely not Christopher Guest's best work. In fact, I'd put it at the bottom of his other great comedies. First off, this work appeared a lot more 'scripted' than his prior films, where improv is the best part of his films. Second, the mockumentary format is much better than this 'straight' work. In fact, some of the best part of the film was in the DVD deleted scenes of interviews by the reporter.Guest has a huge number of people that he uses for his films, all usually quite wonderful. That was why I didn't quite understand the need to include even more people which, while humerous (Nina and Monk), really added nothing to the plot of the film and took time away from the other great actors.I certainly hope Guest's next film returns to his prior format. Overall, this is an ok Guest film, but really not up to the standards of his other films."
4,Funny show,"This film, like all the rest of their films was very funny. But you have to appreciate the humor of this type. Not all people get it. My spouse didn't get it, but I love these actors together. They can be hilarious, you just have to understand where they are coming from and what they are trying to do. If you like ""Best in Show"" or their others, you'll love this one too."
4,Cute Comedy,"Stars get their hopes up about an independent drama when they hear whispers it might be 'Oscar' worthy. The pressure is on and each star deals with whether they are acting for trophies, or just love the work and want that to be enough. A cute comedy about fickle Hollywood and bursting bubbles. If you liked 'Best of Show' and 'A Mighty Wind', you'll like this one as well. Has a great cast!Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,I Wanted to Like This,I've enjoyed some of this groups previous films.I was excited about seeing this and didn't find much to laugh at.
2,see it on DVD,"it had some funny parts, but was disappointing overall. I wish it would have been a mockumentary instead. Definitely wait to see it on DVD."
1,Seemed Interesting,"I DVR'd this movie because the 10-word description on the movie guide looked interesting. We watched about 45 minutes of the movie by sheer force of will, and then gave up and fast forwarded through to the end. We found the story quite slow and full of interruptions that were intended to be funny but simply fell flat. The storyline is about a movie in production that is at first about a brother and sister coming home for Purim to see their mother who is very ill. Somewhere after the first half of the movie, Purim is changed to Thanksgiving. One of the actresses is told that there is a rumor on the Internet that the film will be nominated for an Oscar. This turns out false, and the ending is about the reactions of the actors. Very strange film that we found too boring."
2,Considered... and rejected,"I'm a fan of Christopher Guest and company, but this one was disappointing. There wasn't much that was funny here, subtly or otherwise. Check out the bonus features for the deleted scenes, though - almost all of them are wonderful. Had they been left in the film itself, For Your Consideration would have been a better film."
2,Squandered Talent and Opportunities,"Both the theme and talent behind this project held so much potential, but it was poorly executed.I think the charm of previous Guest projects was that quirky stereotypes were played out and developed beautifully by the cast. The character development--with a few exceptions, just wasn't there. The luddite jokes seemed to be so ""inside"" that only the cast understood them.Yes, there are some priceless lines in this film. Some of the social commentary is indeed scathing, but not consistently enough to maintain the narrative. Catherine O'Hara gave an excellent performance. Carrie Aizly and Jennifer Coolidge were hilarious. Unfortunately, this was not enough to bring this disjointed to film together."
2,"Great Performances, Terrible Film","Christopher Guest abandons the ""mockumentary"" format and drops this turd on us. Too bad. He's once again pulled great performances out of Catherine O'Hara, Harry Shearer, and the great Fred Willard, who steals the show with his ""faux-hawk"" hairdo. The subtle humor that Guest fans are familiar with (""Best in Show,"" ""Waiting for Guffman"") is sadly missing here. There are a few laughs in the final thirty minutes, but they aren't worth the set-up."
2,Disappointing,I didn't want it to be disappointing...I really wanted to like this. But the sparkle wasn't there. Boo.
1,Not the best from this ensemble cast,"While I really liked Best In Show and A Mighty Wind, I have to say that this movie was a complete letdown. I was embarassed to have put it on while guests were over and not stop it right away. Sheesh, what a let down. I got this free from the library and still regret it...."
1,very boring,"now I like Satire's from time to time,but this film never moved me at all. all the subject matters they were refrencing in this film were all predictable. nothing got my interest and I didn't really find much of anything funny or remotely interesting on a whole. i expected a bit more overall."
4,A parody too close to reality?!,"To add my thoughts to the other reviews.I enjoyed parts of this film, but think that prior works of this group are better.IMO, the greatest weakness of this film is that it is a parody which resembles reality too closely.Is reality funny or silly / stupid?My greatest pleasure was seeing these many actors and actresses who I know from other prior films from this group.I enjoyed the directors comments. I have the impression that the directors and producers enjoyed it perhaps more than I.I am a little surprised that the technical quality is not better, OK, but for a modernly made film by a group of this caliber, expected better.I have thought about the question of why this film did not appeal more to me.Perhaps the directors could not decide if they were making a light drama, a satire, or a farce.Can a film be all 3?IMO, too much a drama. IMO, interesting to watch (with DVD controller in hand)."
4,An effective satire of the film industry..,"For your consideration is not the film you would expect it to be.. it is not the same mocumentary style movie that made him popular with such movies as 'waiting for guffman'.. It is a movie about big egos, grandiose ambitions, and the media.. This sounds like a pretty serious film until you consider the cast.. Eugene Levy, catherine o'hara, harry shrearer, and co. are hilarious as a team driven into a ravenous frenzy with the hollywood oscar buzz surrounding their film.. For your consideration is not Guest's best work surely.. (spinal tap and waiting for guffman are classic comedies).. but this film was a great creative endeavor that proves Guest is capable of exploring new teratories.."
2,Longtime Guest fan...but not this time,"I had the chance to take in just one movie over the holidays and the one I wanted to see most was For Your Consideration. Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show are films I watch again and again, and I just knew that Guest and company taking on the pompous film industry would be a riot.Well, something went very wrong with this movie. Abandoning the mockumentary form was a big mistake. The film is a jumble of unconnected scenes and just lurches from one thing to another before a quickly wrapped up finale. But more than anything, it's just not funny. I laughed exactly one time the entire 90 minutes.I was stunned when I walked out of the theater...how could For Your Consideration be so totally unfunny? Well, let's hope it was a fluke and that Guest and his talented actors return to form the next time out."
4,Great Cast,"This was another good movie by Christopher Guest. I love this cast, especially Catherine O'Hara 's character. Recommended, especially if you enjoy Guest's other movies 'Best in Show' and 'A Mighty Wind'."
2,Not the Best of Guest,"After being quite a big fan of Guest's previous works, I was really excited to see what he would do with a more 'traditional' comedy. The answer? He found ways to insert the awkward improvised conversations into a 'traditional' movie - and it doesn't work at all. The saddest thing is that even the normally powerhouse performers of his ensemble couldn't shine through. Very disappointing."
3,Not one of the best....,"Not one of Christopher Guest's greatest efforts but, as always, most of the usual superb cast - especially Catherine O'Hara."
4,Appleworks review,"I am pleased with it. However I am disappointed that the ""learn"" the word in the spelling is not enabled. I like it better than Microsoft word. However I liked MS works the best and they don't make it anymore for apple."
2,There are better choices available,"AppleWorks isn't really a bad product - it's been around for quite a few years, previously as ClarisWorks - but it desperately needs an update. For example, version 6.2.7 still doesn't take full advantage of features found in Mac OSX. Furthermore, it has some rather strange interface quirks and lacks some important features (spellcheck as you type, for example). My recommendation: spend an extra $50 and buy Microsoft Office v.X for student and teacher, which is a much better software package. Another option is to buy a drawing/layout software prgoram such as The Print Shop for Mac OSX, by MacKiev, which offers excellent design and print capabilities for all sorts of projects (labels, greeting cards, calendars, etc). Hopefully Apple will update AppleWorks someday soon."
3,Nice system but...,"I like apple works, and it gets me by for my needs at home but for business I need Windows XP. I like the simple interface, and the straight forward approach. I don't like the spell check, and I have had some troubles saving files in a format where they could be opened easily on a pc. Outside of that I'm a huge Apple Fan and I hope they make the necessary changes to get this thing going right. :)"
3,Good Book but not for a Non-Dairy Organic Diet,"This is a good book if you don't mind eating refined sugar, butter, and milk. The recipes are good if you are on a traditional American diet, but I do wish that she had at least discussed non-dairy and non-refined sugar substitutes. If you already know how to use substitutions, I would recommend this. Otherwise I would suggest getting a different how-to book and perhaps getting this one as substitute. Overall, however, this book is exactly what it says in the title - the recipes are easy and I like the easy-going writing style."
3,good for beginners,"This is a great book for people who have not cooked from scratch before and now need good recipes to make the foods they want gluten free. There's really good information on ingredients and what they do and how they taste. There's help on how to avoid gluten in packaged foods, and a good recipe for an all purpose flour that's used in almost all the recipes.I'm a creative and experienced home cook so once I understand the ingredients I can pretty much do what I want with my own recipes. This is good for people who don't know how to begin cooking from scratch."
4,2nd time!,"This is my second purchase of this book. This one is going to my Mom in Canada.I like this book and will order another one for myself since the author has made changes since I bought mine.I'm not a big baker but I've learned some basics about gluten free cooking that have made my life easier.While there are only a few recipes that I've used several times, Carol Fenster has done a great job of explaining the hows and whys of gluten free cooking and baking. It's easy to mess up a simple recipe if you don't know any better.I'm very grateful to Carol for the hints, this has helped me learn to create on my own."
4,Gluten-Free 101,"This cookbook was exactly what I was looking for. Simple recipes, clear instructions, tasty food. The only downfall I had was finding a few of the ingredients. Most of the flours and starches are available at a number of local grocery stores. But others I had to find online and didn't offer items in smaller quantities for trial purposes."
5,Nashvilles Best,"This cd is will never get any airplay but just because these 2 dont make trl like cash money dont judge it. Young Buck & D-Tay have skill to spare and have the cashville sound that didnt exactly put nashville on the map, but if you know it you love it. Bottom line, this cd is tight underground rap no matter where your from."
5,Watch out for Young Buck's solo on G Unit Records in 2004!,"Watch out for Young Buck's solo on G Unit Records in 2004! Thats because if it is anything like he is in the G Unit's Beg For Mercy, this cd and many other underground records, he'll be hot. Buck is now one of my favourite rappers, and thats pretty good, concidering he hasn't got a real commercial album out yet!Get 'Em Buck!"
1,NYC dis CD is WACK,Please do not buy this CD its not worth my Cash money so like big twizl said save ur mulah pha sheezy believe me fo da 2 geezy turkeise this CD is a WASTE OF MONEY U NEED to get that CHECKMATE CD by B.G.

Do me a favor dont buy this CD. Save ur cash for cashmoney records cd's
2,B Western,"Length:: 6:10 MinsHi. This is my first video review. Let me know if you find it ""useful"" and ""interesting"". And please give me any suggestions how to make them better.FWIW - the video was made using Adobe Elements Premiere 10 software."
3,For hard-core Stewart and Fonda fans only,"Leonard Maltin's review was right on. This is a slow-paced, downbeat Western with a twist: Fonda's the bad guy, the leader of a misfit band of renegades who will stick with him only if he tolerates their bad behavior while in Firecreek ( the ghost town that doesn't know it's a ghost town). If you love Stewart and Fonda, as I do, it was worth watching; otherwise, if you like slow westerns, watch ""High Noon"" instead."
5,Don't wonder any longer,"If you are even wondering if you should buy this to read...stop. Don't think at all - until after you buy it and begin to absorb its amazing depth and breadth.You will begin to understand the world as you watch it before you from an entirely fresh perspective.Then, read the rest of his works and you will have a very high level of teachings bestowed from much secret instituional knowledge.Will you leave it at knowledge or turn it into wisdom?Light to the student of life..."
4,Nice,"This is a helpful book to read if you want to learn how nature works. It's not a book telling much, but it does briefly explain the value of numbers and how numbers pan out in the universe. After all, life consist of numbers so to begin learning about nature, to acknowledge the meaning of numbers is important."
5,Hardwire means no cord attached,"My husband and I used to be builders, and can offer some information which may help buyers when determining what electrical item is appropriate for their situation or particular task. Power strips that say ""hardwire"" are meant to be wired directly and will have no cord, since they are usually mounted permanently - like a light fixture. Power strips with an attached cord will state that it has a cord, will usually state the cord length, and may be plugged in and unplugged as needed - like a lamp. Hope this helps."
1,NO CORD... PICTURE DECEPTIVE,This power strip does not have a cord! Be Warned... If you buy this you'll need to buY a separate power cord and buy a receptacle and then break out a metal piece and spend time trying to put it together.2 separate people at our company ordered these... BIG MISTAKE...

3,Good looking fountain - but noisy motor,"Bought this fountain a couple of days ago. It was easy to assemble. The instructions were good. Looks beautiful with the torch and the water sound is pretty loud. That was the most important thing I was looking for. I However, there is also some motor noise that is equally strong and distracting. This could be due to the power connection in my backyard, but it may be the motor itself. I am searching for a solution to get rid of the noise."
1,Not worth even trying,"I've been using Quicken for years, but I like to check out alternatives. So, since there were many positive reviews, here and in the PC mags, I thought I'd give Money a try.Forget it! Here's why:1. A pain in the neck to set up.2. It wouldn't import my Quicken data.3. Couldn't review and modify what was being set up.4. Documentation inadequate.Need I go on? I'm not a novice, so if I had trouble, I expect that so will most others.Quicken is far from perfect, but on the whole it has been solid, powerful, and fairly easy to use. The latest versions have annoying ads, but I find that easier to live with than the Money interface."
1,Nothing Like Quicken,"Beware Quicken users!I've been using Quicken since 1991 but thought it was time for a change. I've read some good reviews of Money and have never had a problem learning new software, so I took the plunge and bought Money 2004.What a mistake! Here is what I liked least:1. The interface is absolutely nothing like Quicken. Figure on spending hours to acheive a basic familiarity.2. It's a typical Microsoft product. That means the software tries to outsmart you rather than letting you work the way you want to.3. The interface is way too cluttered. At every turn Microsoft is trying to sell you something - insurance, mortgages, baked apples, whatever. It's like working on a billboard.4. To use Money you have to sign up for various external services, like Net Passport or whatever it's called - a real pain.5. There's no Quicken.com where you can put your accounts on the Web.All in all, a tremendous disappointment. Under no circumstances would I advise anyone to switch from Quicken."
1,It's Extinct,"I have MS Money 2004, which Microsoft elected to discontinue supporting the online stock/fund updates without any warning or notification to me. Money 2004 was great while it was fully functioning with the online financial updates, but now....? Why would anyone want to buy this product that Microsoft no longer produces or supports?I am switching to Quicken 2010 as soon as it is available. I have no choice."
4,Microsoft Money 2004 Premium,"This is an old version, but still a good one, mainly for an old retired man who wants to organize its wealth the best possible."
3,premium is a ripoff,"money itself is nice enough, but paying more for the premium version over deluxe is a rip-off--every single additional ""feature"" is actually part of a limited-time trial for a 3rd-party Web service called Gainskeeper. Nowhere will anyone tell you how much this costs until you register for it. The regular Gainskeeper service is $20/yr, which is (surprise!) exactly what you paid to upgrade from Deluxe to Premium, so much for the ""free"" trial. Among the many ways this sucks includes you have to create and maintain a completely separate second version of your portfolio, store it on their web site instead of your own PC, and then (once you go past an introductory number of trnsactions annually) you have to pay per-transaction to enter your own trade data, anywhere from 20-90 cents each. Very very weak, there's no reason why this can't be included within Money itself for the extra $20. By all means choose Money over Quicken, but stick with Deluxe and save some bucks."
3,Moved From Quicken,"As I've been a Quicken user from the beginning for my personal finances and investments, I decided to upgrade to Microsoft Money 2004 Premium for the following reasons.1. Quicken has not shown me and upgrade that is worth buying since I purchased Quicken 2002 deluxe. If the new quicken is going to do the same as my Quicken 2002 Deluxe, why upgrade and that's all I see in the new Quicken.2. Free stuff from Money 2004 that Quicken can't match. Such as a free year of your credit report monitoring service. Two free years of online bill paying are just a few.3. Better financial and stock watching information and software.These are a few reasons why I moved from Quicken. But don't be fooled believing that Moneys interface is like Quicken, It's not. It will take Quicken user some time to become familiar with the way Money works and sometime to setup Money to your liking. But in all It's worth the change for a better product."
4,"pushed by Quicken, happy with result","very intuitive user interface, easy to use. I have finally abandoned Quicken after 10 years of use, and after Intuit has failed to produce a compelling version since 1999. Money has good support for multiple currencies, and the upgrade was smooth and even fixed a longstanding discrepency in a cash account balance that I could never chase out of Quicken. My biggest complaint so far is that the portfolio update feature is really slow (about 3 minutes), even with a 512 dsl. I don't really have that much data...."
2,"Nice play food, but not made in Germany. Made in China.","This set is not quite as nice as some of the other Haba play food. The cheese and cold cut slices are quite flimsy, compared to the slices of pepperoni in the pizza set. The magnetic bread is a nice touch, but it only holds together if the sandwich has less than three slices, and not at all if lettuce or tomato are used. I would probably not buy this again, because it's a bit frustrating for the kids when the sandwich falls apart more often than it sticks together.Another note: Haba has begin manufacturing in China. I purchased this set thinking it was made in Germany and was quite surprised to find that it was actually made in China. I won't be buying any further Haba products unless I can verify that they are indeed made in Europe. These toys are nice, but very overpriced for China-made goods."
2,Skip It,"Haba made in Germany = greatHaba made in China = almost always lousy.It is like bizarro world. Who designed it? The magnets only hold the bread together and then there is a bunch of thin, not very nice pieces of fabric left. It stands in pathetic contrast to etsy felt food or the plan toys wooden pieces."
2,nice idea but doesn't work,"our son got this for his birthday,it looks nice and we loved the idea but unfortunately the magnets are just not strong enough and won't even hold one piece of cheese- so no sandwich-making, you can of course still play with the individual parts but why have magnets at all then?"
1,A SAD ATTEMPT AT PORTRAYING AUTHENTIC JUDAISM,Rabbi Sacks has done a misreable job. He has glossed over the basic truths of Judaism in order to find a mythical common ground with other religions. He does a true disservice to authentic Judaisim. For an accurate portrayal of Judaisim I would recommend THE NINETEEN LETTERS by RABBI S.R. HIRSCH elucidated by RABBI JOSEPH ELIAS. (Feldheim Publishers)
4,Umbra tab top panels,"These window panels look very nice, and are well-made. Only problem I have is that the 86"" panels are barely 85"" long, including the tab tops. Once hung on the rod, which spreads the tab out some, they're closer to 84"" long. I was really hoping they'd be the full 86"", but they will still work, just glad I didn't install the rods without measuring first."
4,Love it,"Love the color and the texture. They were longer rather than shorter and dragged on my floor a bit but i prefer that. I ordered six panels to get me the fullness i needed for my bedroom bay window. It added light to my blue beach themed room. The only reason i would not rate this product a 5 is because i had to iron all 6 panels to get the smooth finish before hanging them. Which i consider a small effort to pay for opaque heavy cotton drapery. I am also very satisfied with the privacy I do not need a shade or lining. However my bedroom does not ever get direct sunlight due to the huge mango tree that faces the window, so in that regard i am lucky :) Great product!"
5,I love this little book,"I can't believe how packed it is with inspiration and wonderful teachings. Michael is definitely a very gifted, special teacher. I am about halfway through and don't want to skip a day. It is a great way to start your day and is at the same time helping me to get in touch with the Essence of who I am. I heartily recommend it to everyone!"
4,Very heavy,"In some ways reading one of these two-page chapters everyday seems tedious if your really doing some soul searching about what is being taught to you...still, I think its very helpful."
3,Disappointed,Having attended Agape when I lived in Los Angeles I looked forward to continuing to gain from Michael's inspiration.I am sorry to say this book is a disappointment for me. I do not feel inspired when I read the daily messages and the affirmations do not resonate for me. I continue to read hoping to find that spark of inspiration that comes across so brilliantly when I hear Michael speak. I am now on day 10....This is my personal experience and yours may be completely different.
1,Very Disappointed Customer,"I ordered, 40 Day Mind Fast Soul Feast, and couldn't wait to get it. The problem is it never came. I contacted the seller and they politely did nothing about this aside from suggesting that I check the building to see if someone else had received the book. Big laugh on that. I have never had a problem with mail until I ordered from this company. They didn't even offer tracking the book. They just want to take your money and hope you don't care. I care about my $6.00, thank you very much! And I wanted that book!"
5,Brilliantly Inspirational,This man is briliantly inspirational. His precepts are truly divine inspired and universal in their application for all of humanity.
5,Writes with Faith & Understanding,"Time-Life Books are usually generic with plenty of pictures and vapid statements that will offend no one except those with literary taste. In this case the author is Anne Fremantle, a long time interpreter of the Middle Ages. She was a scholar, teacher and journalist who was a convert to Catholicism.This is not school textbook history. Europe in the Middle Ages (about 500 AD to 1450 AD) is presented as a coherent whole, a cultural entity not yet split into East and West. This is popular history to entertain without controversy or distortion: the rise of urban life, the power of the guild, the troubadours, the role of knights, the age of cathedrals and castles, the crusades and the monastic life. What a relief that feudalism and theological differences are explained painlessly. The picture essays, always a strength of Time-Life publications, are complemented by the author's feeling for the subject."
4,a CLASSIC but not accurate,"Applebaums recent work 'Gulag' has used much more recent data and 'the Black Book of CUmmunism"" is a good resource as a compendium to reading this classic book on the horrors of communism. Solzhenitsyn(a russian nationalist) was onbe oft he first to write on the Soviet Gulag, a system that had 10-20% of the country in camps throughout Siberia, crimea and northenr russia, building all manner of projects like the White Sea Canal. Communism enslaved its own people, worse then the Tsar had done, and used them to create a 'socialist paradise'. Aleksandr lived through the Gulag and worte this classis work on the camp strucrure and the shear mass of the cmaps across russia. A neccesary read for anyone interested in Russia and the crimes of communism."
1,Cold War Classic!,"This is a book of the kind of testimonies that pushed the Reagan Revolution into Europe. It's 100% pure reaganaut political propaganda, of the same brand that the neocons sold us on Iraq. It's sweet and silly and full of touching fables. Of course, every event depicted was either totally fabricated or distorted beyond recognition. Now that the USSR has been dismantled, plenty of government archives are now available. Will anyone fact-check this book? No. The wall is down, and there is no further need of it. It served its purpose. There are 66 million lies in this book."
1,Too much whining,"This is a boring book about a guy who goes to prison in the Soviet Union. Throughout the book, the author whines incessantly about getting a bum rap. He believes that he was wrongfully imprisoned (That's a new one).According to the author, he was imprisoned for criticizing the Soviet government in a letter that he wrote to a friend. But his story is not believable to me. I'm sure there is something that he isn't telling us.He also complains a lot about the unpleasant conditions in prison.Newsflash: Prison isn't supposed to be fun. People who are in prison should do their time and not complain about it.There are three huge volumes in The Gulag Archipelago saga. I only read the first (unabridged) volume. Maybe the abridged version is better. I don't know. The abridged version probably cut out a lot of the author's whining, which would definitely be a plus."
4,the gulag,"see my review on First Circle, and the Cancer Ward was another one of his great books, started reading them when I was 17 and am now 69."
5,Gulag Archipelago,Excellent book. Everyone should be required to read this. It's hard to believe that so many people went thru so much and now their history is being hidden from everyone!
5,Almost forgotten in America..,"Consider this fact: Putin has just made this book required reading in Russian schools.In American schools, nobody has ever heard of it, or seen it, or speaks of it.""It is a puzzlement!"""
5,Hilariously Romantic and Sexy!,"Fast paced, funny, great banter between lovable characters! I had so much fun reading this book I truly did not want it to end. I felt as though I was invited into their time and space and was allowed to become one of them for a short while. I am already missing my new friends! I have recommended this book to every avid reader in my family and I highly recommend it to you."
5,Fantastic! FIVE shooting STARS! Don't miss this book!,"Saddled is a FIVE STAR romance! It has everything a romance reader could ask for- love, danger, action and sparkling wit. With Saddled, Delores Fossen has written a tremendous romantic comedy with a very funny western slant. Ladies, not only will you fall in love with the handsome hero, Rio McCaine, but all the characters as well. From the spunky heroine, Abbie Donegan to her adorable outspoken kid sister, Gussie. The story is fast paced, the humor is really funny, and the romantic scenes... well, let's just say they are VERY WELL DONE! You DON'T want to miss this book!"
2,good story-filled with spelling and grammar errors,"I liked the story , but it was filled with so many grammar and spelling errors that it was hard to keep track of the story. Words were missing especially the small words that complete a sentence. It was like having to read between the lines to understand the story. I used to do this when I was younger when I wrote letters to my grandmother. She always told me that my mind was working faster than my writing. She had to fill in the blanks to know what I was writing. A letter is short compared to a book. This should have been proofed more closely."
1,About Life and Uganda,"I did not care for this book. It is not about Uganda. I searched in vain for some indication that the author knew something about this unique country. I have concluded that he, in this book, exhibits no knowledge of Uganda.I was disappointed and feel that the title is quite misleading."
4,I DEFINATELY recomend this if you want to lose weight.,"The first day I tried Slim Coffee, I was bouncing off of the walls. I got on a bike and rode for 3 hours, then walked for 2. I didnt ONCE think about food. Wether or not I lost weight between then and now, I do not know. Do I doubt it? Not a chance. It tastes TERRIBLE. Thats the only thing I dont like. I dont like that there are no directions...accept drink 2-3 cups a day. I recomend drinking two. If you feel the need for a 3rd one, then drink a 3rd one. No more though. You won't go to sleep."
3,Not Bad,"I'm losing weight while using this product, but I'm not sure that it's because of the coffee, or my new exercise program. it tastes horrible, and it fails at it's claim of curbing hunger, but something's working. I doubt it's this."
3,"I Love Slim Coffee, but it doesn't work","I drink several cups a day, sometimes decaf, sometimes regular. I haven't lost a single pound. I keep drinking it because I like the convenience and the taste. Would I recomend it to you if you really want to lose weight? Not a chance. It does curb my appitite for a few hours but again, I have seen no decrease in my weight and I actually do exercise two to three times a week."
1,Very bad resolution of small numbers and letters,"Whatever printer was used for the card did not have good resolution. The numbers and letters for 20/20 vision and a couple of other fields are blurred and you can't tell what they are supposed to be even if you can see well. Even though it was cheap, I wouldn't purchase it again."
5,handy,"Handy and pocket sized and objective in its ability to test near vision. I taped it to my clipboard, which seems to work well."
1,"Do not buy, will not work for testing","The product came packaged very well, but the letters were smudged and barely readable on the card.For a card used to do vision screening the letters should be clear and crisp, which these were not.Will probably work for tuning skis though, scraping old wax off, about the only thing it is good for.So if you are looking for this for using in medicine, as I was, I would definitely look elsewhere!!"
2,Extremely Poor Quality,"I received this in the mail, and I am extremely disappointed with the quality. The cards are flimsy plastic that one can see through, which is a problem when testing vision. The print is blurry which affects vision. As an ophthalmologist, nobody should be using these cards, not med students, not nurses, and especially not ophthalmologists. They are of very poor quality and highly unreliable. My mistake, I guess you always get what you pay for.On another note, the shipping time and packaging was perfect. Unfortunately that doesn't help the product quality.And one more note, I contacted the seller, and they immediately (within a minute responded and offered a refund). Excellent customer service. (But again, unfortunately that doesn't help the product quality.)"
2,Really flimsy cheap piece of crap,Same thickness as a piece of paper. Really low quality. Could do better at any med school bookstore or med supply shop. This thing truly is a piece of crap.
1,Awful quality!,The ink on this is very blotchy and the card is translucent. The smallest and second smallest numbers are missing parts due to the blotchy ink. It makes the card virtually useless. The card being translucent also makes for a bad eye exam. I am a medical student and thought I'd live with this until I saw a WAY better card for the same price in my campus bookstore. I didn't realize just how bad this one way until I saw how good they can be. I'd buy one somewhere else instead of this very poor version.
1,"Worst Eye Chart Cheap Poor Print, don't get it!","cheap, but really worth about 25c, print is smudged, double printed/poor quality, plastic was dent, so cheap and unprofessional, can't use for patients. Don't get it. Pay more get a better one. I wish the company would stop selling this cheap dip and charge more for a better one."
5,"Good quality product, but not for professional use","If you need a pocket eye chart, this is a very good option. It is very cheap and is of very good quality. But, if you need a professional eye chart, then do not pick a pocket eye chart. Instead pick a full size one."
4,great idea,got this for my daughters medical kit. She loves it and it is small for her hands and very easy to use.
3,Rosenbaum eye chart,ok to stick in my pocket and use at health fairs. Useful pocket size for mission trips. Very easy to use and keep handy.
4,A worthy upgrade to Full Spectrun Warrior,"Unlike some of the reviews I read at Amazon.com for Full Spectrum Warrior, I really enjoyed the original and find the upgrade FSW Ten Hammers to be excellent as far as I have played it. It seems to me that the game developer did a good job of adding further features while keeping up the excitement. I have not tried any multiplayer yet but will eventually and would raise my rating of the game if the MP aspect of the game is as good as what I have experiencd so far. I had some minor video problems at the start which were taken care of when I upgraded my graphics card driver. As always, try the demo first and make sure you have the hardware to match requirements."
2,10 Hammers 9 wasted,"10 Hammers. What a let down, After Full Spec. Warrior, I was wanting more squad based combat. What I got was somthing that was more arcade and less warrior. Flanking and manuvering is still there but enemy spawning out of doors, what they got, 100 bedrooms in there? If you like arcade then this is the game for you. I reloaded Full Spectrum and put 10 Hammers back in the tool box..."
2,Not satisfied,"This book is primarily a marketing book for the author's first book. In every chapter, critical items are refered back to the author's first work. If you've read that book, you'll find this one interesting in regard to deployment. If you haven't read the first book, you'll feel you have been cheated in this book. I know I do."
1,A BIG LETDOWN EVEN AT 4 BUCKS,"This was one of the worst compilations I have heard. Seriously. Do not purchase this disk unless you want to give away 4 bucks. If you were to divide the price of this disk by the twenty-five or so bands that contributed to it.. you would still come up with a value well beyond the worth of this CD. Not trying to be mean, just keepin it real."
4,Portable and sturdy,"This product is compact but still sturdy, it can be attached to your belt or be put under your seat. Overall I'm pretty satisified with this purchase."
4,haunting!,"Though it's no ""queen of camelot"" or ""grail prince"" it's still a captivating story. I just had problem with Essylte's whininess and selfishness but that is part of the qualities that holds Tristan's heart, unfortunately. Talk about pure obsession to the point that one cannot breathe without other is really heartbreaking and terrifying. Anyhow, I love Nancy's writing, you can see in front of you as you are witnessing it at the moment, you can smell the smells, you can feel the pain, touch. She's amazing, I hope she keeps coming up with more stories, they don't necessarily have to be in the Arturian legends, anything will do!"
4,Finally,"I just came into Jimmy Eat World with Bleed American. Ever since I've absolutely loved them, they rock. The only problem is that I had bought every CD of theirs I could get my hands on. This was the perfect addition. And the song ""What I would say To You Now"" is awesome. I finally found more great J.E.W. If you're a fan (static prevails-""bleed american"", if you just like bleed american you might not like this right off) then this is a must have. Not as great as the other CD's, it's a bit choppy, but still awesome (what by Jimmy Eat World isn't?!)"
4,smarter music,"""Spangle"" (a song off this album) my friends has the musical ability that owes each member of the band the aww of an all-around composition for people that have a keen sense of musical talent. Along with almost all the other songs, it has been a change, a punk to an almost perfect representation of alternative rock (but the album formally named ""bleed american"" is the transformation's new spawn) Note: if ""bleed american"" is your first album by [J.E.W.], this album is different and may take some getting used to. It takes time going backwards into their discography, ya know? I Recomend HIGHLY^ for the collection!"
4,Jimmy eats 4 stars...,"This is a cool album by one of my alltime favorite bands. I really give it 4 stars compared with other J.E.W. albums, especially clarity. ""Singles"" doesn't have a track I don't like from beginning to end, but the overall sound of the album just isn't as cohesive as I know these guys can be. But wait! It's not really a release, but b-sides, etc. Ahhh, it's all making sense now. On a side note, I live in Boulder, CO ~ so I've got to love how the Fox theatre is on the front of the album...Anyway, these guys rock, and if you like their other stuff but don't have this one, don't hesitate to pick it up."
4,Just like the old days!!,"I was so pleased when I watched this movie. The original Velma is back! Nicole Jaffe hasn't been heard as Velma since 1974. Hers is the best Velma, and it is so cool to hear her again! Also back is the longest running Daphne voice, Heather North! Add in Casey Kasem as Shaggy and Frank Welker as Fred, and the whole gang is back! Plus, hearing new versions of the original background music is such a treat. This is as close to classic Scooby Doo as you can get!"
3,"Good, but a few problems...","I liked this movie, but it had problems. Scooby and the gang go on an all-new retro animation adventure in Australia, but they are about to face the huge Vampire of Vampire Rock (codername: Yowie-Yahoo). I think the idea of facing a huge vampire is... pretty decent and good, but not as good as the gang facing the Phantom Virus in Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase. Daphne's original voice actor returns, but, IMO, in some of the scenes, were a bit too off. Casey's return was done really well! The Hex Girls return in this movie, and we have new characters. If you're a die-hard Scooby fan, you can get this movie, but you may be disappointed. I still thought it was good."
1,A disappointment,"I was very unhappy with this film and my two boys were too. It was not cute and clever; rather, it was geared toward hard rock and sexual inuendo. It appeared to be created by goofy teenagers. I would definitely not recommend this. It's not as good as, say, the Witch's Ghost, the Wolfman or Cyberchase. Do yourself a favor, and consider skipping this one or getting it from the library. (...)."
4,pleased with dvd,Very pleased with DVD and the price ... mail time was longer than expected ... maybe due to 7/4 holiday.
5,Another Wonderful Scooby movie,"This was the first movie we bought with our DVD player, and they were both worth every penny. It was a good story, the music is good, the animation is great, and the children love it! I highly recommend this movie!"
2,glad I just rented it!,"We here in my household are all fans of the animated Scooby Doo series. Original and new. Minus Scrappy of course! I had somehow managed to miss this one and had never even heard of it. Well let me tell you, I'm glad I only rented it. Its not funny, the accents are horrible, the story was lame and it just wasnt intersting. About the only good thing I have to say about it is a least the animation was good. If you are a die hard Scooby fan you can and should still pass this one up!"
4,Another Strong Scooby Entry,"It may not be the best entry in the current string of animated Scooby movies; but, anything with The Hex Girls in it can't be all bad. If you like Scooby, you'll like this. The animation, story, voice acting, and music are all good. The extras are not usually the strong suit of these entries. This is the case with The Legend of the Vampire."
3,Good first attempt,"Captain Nicholas Sidney is a man of honour. So when his crew rescues a young American woman, he feels duty-bound to see her to safety.Young Julianna Adams has been through ordeal after ordeal. Her fiance recently passed away, she is marooned, and her father is missing (and possibly dead). It's no wonder she is drawn to Nicholas and his kind heart. But will he, and everyone else she encounters, think of her as a wild, rustic American?I enjoyed Christine Scheel's ""A Captain's Castaway."" Nicholas was a genuinely good, honourable man, and I could empathize with Julianna in many ways. Still, the characters didn't stand out as much as I would have liked. And the main characters seemed to NOT interact more often than they interacted, which made for some slow pacing at times. Still, there's a bit of adventure, a bit of a mystery, and the ending was very nice (if a bit abrupt). All in all, it's a good first attempt by a new Regency author. 3 1/2 stars."
5,HLN LIVE IS THE BEST!,This is a concert showing Huey Lewis & the News at their best. They play most of the four chords songs..and then a few hits. The only bad thing about this tape is 10 of the songs are not in color..they are shown on a gray seen.for the old image i guess..but everything else is great!
5,"Just as good, if not better than Yellow Shark","Thank Jebus for the Ensemble Modern. What an incredible group of musicians. I could not agree more with Gail Zappa when she exclaims in the liner notes, ""The precision with which this is played is shocking and delicious."" I am so grateful to this ensemble for realizing the music of one of my favorite composers so capably and lovingly. This recording took skill, determination, and dedication.I, personally, think the arrangements are fantastic. It was a painstaking process to find as much of the original material as possible and then to transcribe the rest. The production is lush, balanced and precise. And, once again, the performances are inspired.My one complaint is that ""Peaches"" feels a little rushed. Everything else is perfect. ""Moggio,"" ""A Pig with Wings,"" ""Naval Aviation In Art?"" and ""The Adventures of Gregary Preccary"" stand out as perhaps a litle more perfect than the rest.I cannot recommend this disc highly enough to any fan of Zappa's music."
4,Awesome Fantastic,This game may not be as fantastic as the ps3's version but for a PSP version its totally awesome
4,Nice but expensive,"I was resistant to purchase this item because of its price, however, once I recieved my Jessem Table Top, I realized that there were pre drilled holes for the stand. That fact, in conjunction with the fact that I was to lazy to custum build a table, and in the time I would've spent doing it, I figured this table would pay off. Now that I have it, it works great, its stable, assembly was easy, it does what its supposed to do.Locking casters would be a nice addition though, as I dont have much space. Four stars because of price."
1,"Bad. Derivative, unoriginal.",The Didjits were a much better band. You'd think from their antics and attitude the Gaza Strippers would have something to say - but they don't - their sound is like garbled Kiss or Cheap Trick at best - but they fluff it up with uncompelling cheesy machismo that ruins the gimmic. Get the real music from the real 70's bands if you want true inspiration.
2,"2,5 stars",This is one of the worst albums Venom have ever released. Definitely for Venom collectors. I cant find a track to meke me like this album. Its just noise.
1,Almost Every Claim By Walk Fit Is Fraudulent,"Ordered WalkFit inserts for myself and my fiancee. Followed their instructions for about 10 days (3 days past their ""break in"" period). I couldn't wait to get them out of my shoes by the end of the day. Foot adjusted somewhat, but not that much. Same with my fiancee. Decided to return them.Sent them back via UPS with deliver confirmation and signature. Walk Fit received them back in mid-September, 2005. No refund given as of yet. No returned emails or phone calls to customer service.Bottom line: WalkFit doesn't live up to ANY of their statements, including their refund policy.I should have known better at the time to buy something off of the TV, but I learned my lesson again."
1,As. seen on TV,"I ordered Walk Fit Orthotics by Phase4 and was extremely disappointed. They are hard, rigid and painful to wear.I was unable to use it in any of my shoes. I called ""As Seen on TV Products"" customer service to complain and they were very rude. I still have the product and it's useless."
4,Nice product,"In my regular shoes these felt hard and uncomfortable, but when I put them in the right shoes (Skechers sport premium, wide width) they are great. I can wear them all day."
1,Walkfit ripoff,"I wouldn't waste your money. I used them for over a month and had absoultely no change. Not only that but the company is underhanded. When they charge you almost as much for shipping as they do for the product something is wrong. I paid 34.90 for the inserts (one for my wife and one for me) and they charged me 24.85 for the shipping and I just used regular shipping, nothing like overnight or 2 day. Ridicules considering it only cost 5.00 dollars to ship."
1,Walkfit orthotic insole,"I'm glad these work for some people. They did not help me. Felt like walking on golf balls (used lowest insert). Tried working up on time used, a little at a time, the longer I used them, the worse my feet hurt. I believe you have to have very very high arch to use."
1,New and improved...NOT,"I have bought orthotic insoles by Phaze 4 in the past and was happy with them. These ""new and improved"" models are terrible...The arch is so high I cannot wear them in any of the shoes I have without being terrible painful...I can stand the arch, but they make my shoes too tight...The older model I bought was nearly identical to the more expensive ones I had bought at the Good Feet Store. The new model is completely different, and not in a good way."
5,Gary,"I had multiple sports surgery to my knee and had knee pain, with possibility of replacement. I tried walk fit and the knees gradually improved, pain reduced and now I have no pain. I do not know how or why they work, but it was the best $20 I have spent. I now own 3 pair and would not go out without wearing them. This is for real."
2,Ow,"Ow. Owowowowow. Do Not Mistake These for actual orthotics made for your unique feet. In fact, these I found to be painful and counter-productive. I bought these as a stop-gap to actual orthotics to straighten out my knees and the Walk Fits radically affected my gait, stride and shape on my foot. The podiatrist I finally got to see scolded me for making my orthotics a much more expensive proposition by first wearing a non-specific insole that did not address my feet, but rather was a commercial One Size Fits All.I'd be very very careful about putting these in your shoes."
5,Planter fascitis(?) relief,"I got this as one of the gifts off my wife's xmas wish list. She loves this thing. It helped her recover from the planter fascitis she was experiencing. She now uses it on which ever shoe she wear daily for an extended time.We had gone to a ""custom fit"" shoe/orthodic store first and it would have costs much more then this one for a set. So we were very happy to find this one."
1,Poor fit,"I wear a size 8.5B with a medium low arch and have purchased professionally made orthotics for 20 years for arch support. These walkfit insoles are terribly uncomfortable. The interchangeable arch (low, med, high) are too far forward. I can't imagine anyone having an arch close to the ball of the foot. Forget trying to get your money back from the manufacture for it is too much of a hassle."
5,Just as Advertised,"Hurt like crazy the first three days, but my back felt better immediately. It might have been because of the new pain in my foot distracted from the pain in my back . I only wore them around the house on the low setting for about an hour a day the first two days. Then I gradually started to use them in longer walks and I am even running in them now with hardly feeling the pads. For the past ten years I almost always had back pain after every time I ran. I only feel slight back pain now after running that usually goes away after a couple of hours. One recommendation I would make to a new user of the foot pads would be to use an old pair of shoes where the arch is already worn out. This will cut down on some of the pain until your foot adjusts."
2,Walk Fit Orthotic insoles,I ordered the insoles to fit my work boots. The heel support was good. The problem that I have with the soles is that they are not long enough for my feet. They do not ride properly centered onto the crest of my arch. This caused improper support and pain throughout my feet. I have size 13 wide feet and ordered the largest size avaialble.
2,Devil's Domain,"This was the first book I read of this author and the series.I did not like it much, I found the characters rather unattractive, and the story line also not very exciting.I love medieval thrillers, and I read many and enjoyed manyof them (the delightful series of Priscilla Royal, the three books of Jason Vail, and currently Peter Tremayne), and found the characters delightful, well defined and easy to like.But I did not like this particular story and the characters involved, and I had difficulties following.I guess Dominican monks are not very attractive to me...."
4,Devil's Domain review,"A great quick read, full of mystery, humor, and a bit of history from 14th century London. Characters are very amusing."
3,Tool fans- Beware!,"A lot of press was given to Cortizone due to their associations with Tool (they are friends with Justin Chancellor) and their support of Tool on the Lateralus Tour.I believe the band were previously called Kane, and they've been around for a while in an underground kinda way. They play proficiently and have a punky, buzzing industrialesque style that is reminiscent of 'nurse'-era Therapy?, The Almighty and Pitchshifter - there's no doubt that this band sound a bit British, which is no bad thing. However, the melodies get a bit repetitive, with half of the tracks making very little impression on the listener.'Cold' is good, and 'Jesus Come up' is absolute brilliance, however, and Machine has done a beautiful production job. This is one for those who liked the edgy alienated sound of the early Therapy? stuff, but will be a bit samey and irritating for the average Tool/APC fan, I fear."
3,Meditative flute and synthsizer,"Title track is worth price of the album. The other six songs are of the same ilk but don't have the same magic. They are in the meditative, relaxing background NewAge category with flute, synthesizer and male chants as ingredients. The length of the songs range from seven to nine minutes each except for the finale at just over five. I am rating three stars for the overall album, but again, the title track is a five."
2,poor quality,"I had these files in my office from a previous purchase form a local vendor, but couldn't locate them anymore for my HR dept so I purchased a hundred throughAmazon. This order was a poor quality. I have to re-glue every folder. Very disappointed since I really like the print on the cover of the folders."
4,Very Bright,"This is a very bright headlamp. When you press the button, it cycles through the 3 levels of brightness. I wish that the first press started on the brightest setting. The lamp is comfortable, but the elastic causes me to sweat around it."
3,great unless you drop it....once,Great light. I'm an electrician so I use it all the time. Fell off my head once and the cap for the battery pack cracked and flew off. They either need to make the cap heavier or out of metal cause this thing was ridiculously thin on the rim.
4,Overall the best Headlamp I have used,"This is my second streamlight, and I own a few other headlamps- always trying to find the best.The streamlight does not put out the most light, but its a fairly wide beam.Best things aboiut this are construction compared to just about all the others, headband quality, and general ease of use- button location and tilt mechanismSince I bought a second one as you can imagine I would recommend it for all around use"
4,Great Light!,"This headlamp is great. I like the 3 levels of brightness. Very bright output on the highest level. It put's out more light than my other headlamps, and gives out more light than my friends headlamps. Fit's great and I like that it comes with a hard hat strap. It would be nice if the light beam was foucused more into a spot light. It's a wide beam of light which isn't bad. I still give this light a 4 out of 5!"
4,Streamlight 61052 Septor,"Headband fits good,unit is light weight, easily focused, creates good hands free lighting. Very effective for dollars spent,would reccomend to anyone needing hands free light source."
1,Need a new headlamp,"I do a lot of two-handed precision work, and was looking forward to the Streamlight. It worked well for about 4 hours, then died. New batteries,etc., nothing helped. I'm in the market for another brand as a result"
2,Not what I expected,"The lamp its bright and it works fine, just not what I expected, the light pattern its wide, not focus so much in one area, no matter what setting u used.."
5,great,good:-great powerful light for night time gardening-great price-easy to usebad:-a little unattractive looking-slightly bulky
2,Good idea with a weak battery cap,"I had the lamp for about six months and the cap for the battery was broke for a normal use. I thought it was my fault and purchased another one. Same problem occured. Now I have two headlamps with broken cap. I put a tape around to secure the cap and it is a major pain. Unless they fortify the cap with a stronger material, I would not buy this lamp again."
2,There are better lights with better warranties,"I like the fact this light is bright, and has three levels for saving battery power. It's also very sturdy, with a rubber-armored bezel.What I don't like is the fact that the rubber parts are poor quality!After a few years, the bezel started to craze and crack apart. What's worse is that the rubber dome switch cover basically dissolved and fell away. So now I can only turn the light on or off by sticking a paperclip into the light to press on the microswitch.Streamlight claims their lights have a ""limited lifetime warranty"". But that warranty basically excludes everything; so in reality it's a two-year ""lifetime"" warranty. :-)There are many flashlight manufacturers who offer REAL lifetime warranties. Streamlight is not one of them."
4,Headlamp,Bought this item based on the reviews from other purchasers and research on about 3 other items out there. This seemed to fit what I needed to do the most. I used this 3 times within the first 3 weeks I bought it. It's quick to get ready instead of stringing extension cords and drop lights for relatively quick jobs. For me it's HVAC and cat 5 wiring projects. It works well. There's 3 levels of lighting. I wear it with a ball cap so the weight of the battery pack is not an issue. It stays with me so I don't have to juggle a flashlight and hand tools. So far I'm pleased.
4,great headlamp flashlight,"EVERYTHING CAME IN PERFECT CONDITION. THE LIGHT WORKS GREAT. THE HEAD STRAP WORKS GREAT. I ONLY THING THAT SEEMS CHEAP IS THE ACTUAL LIGHT ANGLE ADJUSTMENT. IT FEELS AND SOUNDS CHEAP. THE RACHET IS MADE OF PLASTIC I THINK. WE'LL SEE HOW LONG IT'LL LAST. OTHER THAN THAT, ALMOST ALL PRODUCTS FROM STREAMLIGHT ARE VERY HIGH QUALITY AND LAST FOR EVER."
2,Maybe Mine was a Special Case,"The lighting characteristics, weight and fit of this product were pretty good, but unfortunately, I had to return it because it would not turn off for me. Maybe it's because I used an Ultimate Lithium 8x set of batteries (which really are more powerful aaa batteries than alkalines), but even if an alkaline might not have kept the single last LED lighted after turn-off (visibly) like the Lithium batteries did (and I don't know this), I would still suspect it of draining the batteries. There was no way I could successfully loosen the battery cage to extinguish the last LED after turn-off."
5,Brightness lights,"It so cool. I love it I use it all the time whatsovver I go in the dark,attic basemant anywhere you need it. It so brighter than other lights . It have 7 LEDS with 3 buttons low , med and High. I still buying more but still want more longer battery life.Thanks to Steamlight.Jeffrey V. NY"
5,The product works great!,"Has 3 levels for the lights from low to high, and the head band is adjustable to fit any big old head. Good for working in the dark and able to use both of your hands."
5,"Bright, light, fit well. Well done!","Agree with the other reviewer, everything is excellent about it, except one point: the tilt mechanism is rather flimsy. Then again, it's not meant to last for a life time I suppose. The price just dropped right after I received mine in the mail today! Such is my luck :) Great for what it is. By the way, I had two similar lights from Costco and Wal-Mart, this light is about 10 times brighter with the same weight and far better fit on the head. The price is not that different. Good deal. I use it when cleaning my camera sensor and stuff. Very helpful."
4,"Great light, but a bit heavy","I bought this to use when I take walks at night, now that it is getting dark so early in the evening. It puts off a great amount of light, and is well made. It's fairly comfortable to wear, but is a bit on the heavy side. I put it over a hat and it is more comfortable to wear. I wore it once when I was building some shelves in my basement in an awkward location. It was great for that as well, but didn't have a hat on and it kind of traps the sweat behind the light. So again, a hat or something would be best with this."
5,Love It,"I really love this thing. In fact, I love it so much, that I bought a second one as a gift for my best friend. I have used it to replace receptacles in the kitchen, install a ceiling fan, repair work under the house in the crawl space, and even a little tune up of the gas log in our fireplace. The best features for me are being able to work hands free, no hassle ability to keep light right on what you are working on (or reaching for), and the option of three diferent lighting levels. I didn't know how important being able to adjust the lighting level would be until I worked with it in some of these challenging places. You can get just the right amount of illumination without creating the glare that my other lights would typically create."
5,Great Light,"I am an electrical contractor, so I often crawl through basements and attics. This light makes pleant of use full light - works great."
4,"versatile, dependable headlamp","I purchased the Streamlight for use in my crawlspace and it performs well for that purpose. It feels comfortable, so I have expanded it's use for night time dog walking and on occasion, reading in bed so as not to disturb my spouse. Once I received it, I found that it has a limited lifetime warranty, excluding only excessive abuse and batteries. That's just an added bonus to a well made product."
2,Streamlight Septor Led Headlamp,"Nice headgear on headlamp, but it seems as though headlamp use's a lot of batteries,and for the price I expected a little better light."
3,Over head light,Good if you are doing craft projects and in a poorly lit room. Not bright enough to see in some ones mouth.
2,Bright but flimsy.,"I am a mechanic and work the night shift so I use my headlamp everyday. I bought this light about 2 years ago because it's got adjustable lumens and it's a Streamlight with a lifetime warranty. I was very happy with it in the beginning but then the tilt screw kept coming loose. Then the strap bracket broke and I had to tape the band on. Then the hinge that holds the light to the band broke. The battery cap is also cracked. It does, however, produce great light and the batteries last a long time. I would only recommend this light to the occasional user not someone who uses them everyday all day. I have sent this light in for warranty and was told over the phone it would be at least 3 weeks so I'll have to buy another because I can't go that long without it. Let's hope the warranty is good."
2,cheaply made for short life,After one year of light use ( ie inside the house at night) both of my units have fallen apart. Pay more and get something durable.
1,Out dated,There have been many advances in LED technology in the past year. This is old news and not worth your money. Check out black diamond brand headlights. Much more bang for your buck.
5,Great Light,Love the white light of LEDs. Love the 3 level light switch to save battery when not needed. Everyone should have one of these!
5,Great,This product is absolutely perfect--just what the doctor ordered. I may purchase another one to keep in my car for emergency roadside work as it keeps both hands free.
3,Great stuff. Cuts thru PVC traffic cones.,"This stuff is great. I am using it to stencil traffic cones, which no paint or stencil ink will stick too. I used about half a bottle inside a small air paint sprayer. I cut the ink with lacquer thinner (about 10:1 thinner to ink) and it still covers nice and dark, dries instantly and sticks to the slick, PVC surface of the cones. It dries so fast it can be a little cloggy but still works quite well in spite."
5,XIT,"One of the largest ranches in the Texas Panhandle in the 1800's was the XIT. The Llano Estacado was yet to be conquered by white ranchers looking for free and easy grazing. With the coming of barbed wire, the smaller ranches were absorbed by the larger operations, mostly funded by foreign money men. The cowboys are the ones I found the most interesting part of the ranching history. They each led a soulful life, their best friend was their horse, with occasional visit to neighboring ranches or fandangos at nearby villages. It was a harsh enviornment, but the men who worked it was also harsh. Most of them learning from older cowmen, most of them young.The XIT is well written and researched. A good history read."
5,This cymbal is perfect,"This is an amazing cymbal, it adjust for all kind of music styles, its brilliant finish is striking, and the sound is really loud and clear. This cymbal is known for its professional level. I like it so much, that's why I gave it 5 stars, perfect!"
3,size,"I ordered size 10, my shoe size. It was way to big. I returned them for size 9 (no half sizes) It just about fits my feet. Really needed a half size more"
2,Flimsy,I've previously owned 2 pairs of Havaianas. Both were store bought. This time I decided to order the same product (color and size) from Amazon. These flip flops are flimsier and thinner than my old pairs. I wonder if the quality has been downgraded or if these are counterfeit...
5,Great flip flop!,I REALLY like this flip flop a lot. It is light and comfortable and the color is very nice. I may order in different colors.
5,Average/Narrow feet,"I have relatively normal sized feet, I wear size 11 in Nike Pegasus and these fit me perfectly. The rubber is much more durable than typical flip flops. After a summer's worth of wear, I'm still happy with them. They're a tad floppy but what do you expect?"
2,Not comfortable,Wanted to try these because my Reefs didn't last. These are not as comfortable. The plastic tube that goes between the toes is a skin chafer. Guess I'm going back to the Reefs.
2,TO NARROW FOR MEN FEET,"THE COLOR IS NICE, BUT THE FLIP FLOP LOOK LIKE IS FOR WOMEN FEET, IS NOT FOR MEN FEET, IS TO NARROW, AND FOR THE SIZE 9 IS SMALL."
4,Great flip-flops,Comfortable and stylish. I ordered the 7/8 size and they fit me quite well (I usually wear a shoe size of 7). They are a bit thinner across than my other flip-flops.
5,On time delivery and a quality product,I was looking for a shower shoe to wear at the gym after working out and found the perfect product. Light weight and a good product to meet my need.
1,NOT THE REAL THING!,"I purchased real Havaiana sandals about a month ago and just recently purchased these because I left mine at a hotel resort in Mexico. I was excited because I hadn't seen this color combination in stores and I should have known it is because it probably doesn't exist in the real Havaiana collection. The left sandal is so fake that it can't even hold my foot in it. My heel goes to the right because the back of the flip flop is too thick. NOT REAL, save your money and go to nordstroms and just buy them for $18"
3,Super Quality,"These flip-flops are super in quality but i was disappointed with the size i order. I received a pair of these Havaianas Brasil flip-flops in pink as a gift and the size 39/40 fitted perfectly but when i ordered the size 39/40 online it was a bit small, i needed the next size up, don't understand why the same sandal in the same size has 2 different fit, 1 just right and 1 a bit small.If you intend to order these order a size up from your regular size."
1,stylish but flimsy,"the part of the strap which connects to the sole keeps popping out. and these were the more expensive ones! very disappointing for the price, I hate them, people: turn and run"
5,great stuff hard to find,"great stuff, harder and harder to find retail, even thou the company says its still avail and lists stores that carry the line;no one carries the scrub, fearful of discontinuation, buy NOW experience the best smelling and working scrub ever !!"
4,Not Perfect Wedding Keepsake,"As you know it is difficult to find a good Keepsake Book for your Wedding or Anniversary out there. This hard-cover book will keep well in the years to come yet I was disappointed by the fact that there were only two pages for wedding photos. I guess I was hoping that this book would have a fat section for wedding day photos and keepsakes such as invitations and special cards received. Also the glue from the velcro ""pocket"" sections caused yucko grease stains on two parts of the book. Overall this book has all the major ingredients to make a fine journal and keepsake for all your marriage memories. I only hope I remember to write in it every year for the next 25 years!"
4,Excellent wedding gift!,"I was very pleased when I received this book. More so than I expected to be after reading some of the other reviews. The idea I was going for was to have a record book to cover the couple's entire life together and not be limited to just the wedding as so many books are. Those always get put away. Very tasteful decor throughout, without a lot of stuff you don't need, with room for a few pictures in each section, and envelopes for mementos, I think this will be a keepsake the couple I chose it for will cherish throughout their life. I also bought ""The Book of Us"" to include in the gift, as I thought it would be an excellent companion. Add a pen, some coffee mugs, and maybe some designer coffee ... and VOILA!!! Excellent, unique wedding gift!"
4,i decided 2 give it a chance,I first heard Puya on mtv's return of the rock thing. They had ther video for Oasis on the show and I absolutley hated some parts. I mean the verses were good but when the chorus started and i hear trumpets playin in the background I was upset. Abouta month later my friend bought the hard & the heavy album. I listened to Fake and I loved it. I decided to give this album a chance. I made a good choice when I bought this cd. it's absolutly great. It's impossible to make a mistake buy buying this album
5,Totally Oringinal,one of the best cds ive heard in a while. when i first heard it i thought of korn and how i felt when i first heard them. im not saying they sound like korn but they're very original like them. go out and buy it. it was the best 13 bucks i ever spent.
5,ITS AWESOME!!!!!!!!,"This is a very amazing CD, I can just picture a small band in a garage saying ""why don't we mix some congas with rock instruments"" and so they did. And it is incredible what they did! Some people say it sounds like rap, but it doesn't! unless you like rap, hahaha.. i think its a very original sound but its not strange. Original and enjoyable! Well.. thats all. buy it buy it buy it.I some questions though, where are they now? How come they aren't selling any cds? (all the cds are from other people not from them directly) ?? did they retire? D:"
4,Heavy Hardcore fused with Salsa!,"I feel that this album is extremely unique. It fuses the aggro and hardcore style with a splash of Latin music. Very creative. Few Latino metal bands get much exposure, so I'm glad that they were on the Tatoo the Earth tour with Brazilian thrash legends Sepultura. If you like Sevendust(esp. their debut)and Soulfly, you'll undoubtedly enjoy this most excellent album."
5,FUNDAMENTAL,"It was about time people out of Puerto Rico noticed Puya's talent, delivered with an in-your-face metal/thrash/salsa/hip-hop rythm that will absolutely blow your head away!! The lyrics are great, ranging from socially charged songs to an anthem to boxer Tito Trinidad. If u like music from Sepultura and Rage Against the Machine all the way over to Santana, this album is a must. And be sure to check out Robi ""Draco"" Rosa's Vagabundo..."
5,some just don't understand.,"this puerto ricans rock! they got a unique style, and a hell of a singer! Sergio could be the next Marc Anthony if he ever wanted, but why do that, there is just too much salsa/merengue in this world, therefore he decides to rock like only he can, I worship their talents & hope keep up the good sh!t."
2,WHAT IS THIS?,"Puya are one of the most unique bands I've heard. They are talented at playing Latin music, and they are talented at playing metal. But when you combine the two, the result is completely unlistenable. I wish they would stick with the metal sound, then I would like their music. But the way it is, half of it sounds like Ricky Martin, and the other half reminds me of Static-X. Puya were on of the worst bands at Ozzfest '99. Their music is way too choppy, and will probably not be listened to much by people who like either genre."
4,The new face of mosh,"Puya is one of the best Puerto Rican rock bands out there, but their first cd, which was sold in concerts and small record stores in the island, captured better the amazing raw energy they display live, which is an Experience close to sublime... In any case, This is a great album, and it transmits the great love for la isla that is maintained in exile by all of us... Fundamental."
5,BRUTAL!!!,"About time a Spanish speakin band comes out of the dark and gave us a Master piece; this album really demostrates that Latino culture is accepted in all kinds of musical genres, just in the steps of SEPULTURA, SOULFLY, DOWNSET, EL NIÑO and many more, this band mixes Latin instruments and rythms with the most exquisite, ferocious and brutal thrash core metal anyone ever heard before, so a big BRAVO to PUYA and QUE VIVA LA RAZA!!!!"
5,Puya rocks,"Puya's new cd, Fundamental, is a very good mix of solid thrash rock, salsa, jazz, and hip hop beats. Overall this cd is the melazca...."
4,How awesome our Savior Is!,"One can't help but to fall on our knees in worship to Christ after reading this book. Sproul, in his simple yet clear writing style, opens the life of Christ to us by commenting on each phase of Jesus' life. What I really loved was the truth that we are not saved just by the death of Christ but by the perfect sinless life of Christ. What a great reminder of our precious Lord!"
4,A Moving Reflection of Cold War Pain,"I have never been in the military. That did not, however, keep me from appreciating James Pocock's narrative. In fact, it made me appreciate the suffering and sacrifice of military people. It made more aware of the suffering and pain of those individuals who lived under the oppression of Communist dictatorships.This is a moving story in everyway. And by the end it is also thrilling. The people seem very real. Yet Ret. Col. Pocock's writing is very straightforward, even plain. For this story that seems to be a virtue.I actually believed the story really happened. It was almost a biography of a lost period in time. I had to keep reading the disclaimers about the story being fiction. Do yourself a favor, read this book. If plain writing doesn't offend your esthetics, you will love it."
5,This book should be made into a movie!,"I loved this book on so many levels. As a former student of German, I loved the culture and spirit of Germany conveyed circa the Cold War. As a fan of Grisham, etc., I appreciated the suspense. Finally, as a military officer, I appreciated the nod to American servicemen, albeit a generation ago. ANYONE would love this book. Thanks for writing a book that is both entertaining and historically accurate, MG James Pocock! It was marvelous."
4,amazing results of positive thinking,I would buy anything written by Dr Peale. His books are upbeat and pretty amazing considering they were written so long ago. They are still true today. I'm sending one to my Mom and brothers. Everyone should buy this book whether they believe in God or need some upbeat help for their own lives.
5,The amazing results of positive thinking,"Changes your attitude towards life in the most positive way there could be. A must for everyone. I was lucky to have a dear aunt share it with me when I was only 23. I have read other more newer positive attitude books, but this is the NUMBER ONE.NO ONE BEATS NORMAN VINCENT PEALE."
4,What a problem over a fantasygirl,Three girls who try-out for the play to be cinndareala .They all have a big fight over gets to be her for the play.The slipers give one of the girls blisters and they hert her feet.They get in fight because there's only one cindarralia and they all want to be it as well as other people.Who whould of thought three girls would get into a fight over a fantasy girl who is not even rell and of course your not going to be her forever and only to be in a play!
2,Good for easy reading.,"This is a cute story of Kelly and her two best friends Lisa and Rebecca. Their goal for junior high is to become more ""popular"". When Kelly sees that only Lisa and Rebecca are succeeding, she starts to feel sorry for herself. Its your typical junior high ""tradgity"""
4,Pretty Good Book,"This book is generally good about explaining the topics covered in the recommended homework, but it is weak in examples and visual aids. I would recommend this book to a student for Final Exam practice, or a teacher for tests."
1,crap. A review from a disgruntled student.,"not worth the money. Complete with worthless explanations and crappy examples, this book is a written failure. In the introduction, the author states the book will be helpful and challenging. Ha! A lie if i ever heard one. Please someone write a math book with substance!"
5,very cool,"aloha, i actually haven't heard this cd besides the song yeah, whatever. But i figured since nobody else has reviewed, i should take the executive decision and do it myself. So anywho, now that i'm famous, i would just like to thank zippy, and all my friends, and evil...without which i would ahve no reason to be good."
1,This was a nightmare,"My husband is in the oil field, so I bought this video for him to put in his stocking. It was horrible. It is actually the ultimate white elephant gift at this point. He tried to re-gift it, the person gave it back.This is a one act play, by a lady, that I am positive might be semi-interesting in a class room setting............good luck to anyone who buys it. Hope you find more resourceful than we did."
1,THIS IS NOT OPERABLE,"Contact Sony ere you buy. This gizmo is the best thing since the invention of the cirgarette lighter. Oh yeah;- It is not operable. New receivers are no longer supported by Sony.Nor is the Microsoft version supported by Microsoft.* If you purchase this wonder, you may connect it, admire it - worship it if you care to, but it has been rendered obsolete. Think of the new Web ready TV Sets, which sell for a couple of thousand dollars, think of the cable companies, who might have been loosing revenue because of these wonders, and then ask why it is still being sold, although it will not work. Oh yeah; Purchase it and then try to get rid of it on Ebay. You may be able to seil it for .*Microsoft says that it continues to support the devices IN USE PRIOR to discontinuance. Perhaps Sony does the same"
5,Excellent on So Many Levels,"I echo the views of the other reviewers ... that this book is an outstanding introduction to / overview of 20th century Russian history. It's worth the price for Brian Moynahan's sweeping, lucid narrative alone, but when I first borrowed this book from a friend it was the photographs that kept me rivited for hours at at time over several days. I'm convinced that this will come to be regarded as of the great collections of historic photography ever. Very highly recommended!"
4,History at breakneck speed,"A short gallop through one of the most facinating periods of recent history. The author wears his heart on his sleeve most of the time - his distaste for the ideology is always to the fore. He neglects to examine the confusion and fear of many older people when communism collapsed. The pace means that some human interest stories are passed over or only briefly visited - The basement in Ekaterinberg, Stalins body in the mausoleum, Khruschevs' fall from power, etc. But this leaves you with the desire to investigate these areas further. He is especially interesting and illuminating about the events of 1917 - the sequence of events are explained brilliantly.A good read and a good place to start."
3,A sad history of a suffering people...,"After having purchased and read 'The American Century' (should be on EVERY American's bookshelf!), and 'The German Century' which were both excellent books with many archival photographs I was rather disappointed with 'The Russian Century. This last book is the smallest and thinnest of the three I purchased. It has comparatively few photographs and chronicles the history of Russia/Soviet Union through the 20th century. It is a sad account of a people that has been badly abused by its leadership, whether the czars or the communist party."
2,partial,"Brian Moynahan clearly sets out the assumption that is too guide the rest of his interpretation in his introduction, ""underneath every brownshirt is a red"" or some similar statement. This extreme bias taints the entire work. However, it is still an interesting read"
5,"Great songs, but overpriced","$13 is a lot for these 2-3 great songs. When I bought it it did not list the songs and I was ticked off that I got so little for the price. Barring monetary issues, the songs are great."
5,Relaxing soft jazz Beatle melodies,You don't have to be a Beatle fan to enjoy these wonderful soft jazz renditions of classic beatle tunes. I make it a hobby to collect Beatle music of any genre. This is as good as it gets.
2,Don't let the title fool you...,"The term ""jazzed"" seems to imply excitement and energy - but these piano versions of Beatles songs are pretty sedate. I kept waiting for the album to kick into second gear, and except for part of ""Norwegian Wood"", it never does. Buy this only if you want to hear 8 and 9 minute-long versions of ""Yesterday"", ""Michelle"" and ""Blackbird"" in the style of a piano-bar performer. I guess the CD would also be good if you have insomnia and want to fall asleep to Beatles music. Or if you really need a drink coaster."
4,Deadly foreplay,"This is a deliciously suspenseful novel, with a fascinatingly insane, immensely rich and seductive whirlwind wreaking havoc in the lives of a lot of more or less normal, even likeable people. What will she do next? You HAVE to keep reading -- you can't just leave those characters on the brink of some new disaster. And the sex. Well, actually, the foreplay, because Terri Hamilton, the homicidal maniac egged on by her evil angel, is mostly into titillation, and even the saner people -- her soon-to-be ex-husband Jack and his new flame Hilary -- can't get much beyond foreplay before Terri breaks in to spoil their tryst. The story builds up tremendous tension and at the end -- or nearly the end, because we're left to guess what becomes of Terri -- we just let our breath out."
4,it's metal - it's enamel - it's nice and big,"This pan was a big ole bunch of money coming in at just under 25 smackers, but I think it will last a very long time it's built pretty well, though it's a trifle light weight and the metal on the rolled edges could be a little smoother, the enamel looks pretty good, a little swirly in places. What can I say, it's a good pan for what it is, but it should have been less money. ...but it did a great job on making 14 pounds of baked beans I took to a party...and I'm sure I'll find a multitude of uses for it."
3,OK.....but not Great!,"This was definitely NOT a 5 star book. Probably a 2 1/2 or 3. Silent Witness was my first novel by Lindsay McKenna and even though it wasn't great, I will pick up another one by her and give it a try. I found the storyline a little too slow for my taste for the first half of the book. It did pick up toward the end and ended up being interesting. I also found that Ellen and Jim were a little flat and their romance lacking. Jim was a little too ""hillbilly"" for me. The author should have worked on making her characters a little more believable for the reader. I usually have a hard time parting with a book when I consider it good. In fact, I keep them to reread at a later time. This one is not a keeper, but if you can get it from the library or as a used book, read it."
1,Don't waste your money if you already have 2003...,There isn't one reason to get this update if you alerady have MS Money 2003 Deluxe and Business.Wait until 2005 when they actually might include some real reasons to upgrade.
1,MS Money 2002 is still better,"I will not upgrade from 2002 version, even though invoices are not very customisabe. The only problem 2002 had was you could not save your invoice design for use, if you need to reinstal. And it does not seem that it is fixed in this version. So I will not purchase this product this year. I may even switch to Quicken."
1,MS Strikes Again!,"There are more than one reason not to buy this product!1) All support for MS MONEY is now in INDIA and the folks there smile a lot while talking to you, but they do not know the product.2) There are major software bugs in the software - features that worked in MS MONEY 2003 are broken in 2004 and MS knows about them but refuses to fix them!3) Is a very hard product to install if you have MS MONEY 2003 and are upgrading - more so than the 2003 install was over 2002.So if you want to ensure US employment of folks in the USA, then don't buy this product."
3,Decent ska band...,"Don't get me wrong - I like JFC a lot - but the lyrics to their songs just aren't that original. The songs are catchy (especially One More Time and Something Good)... and the music is upbeat... but I can't listen to it more than once a week, you know? Give it a try, but I wouldn't by any means classify it as one of the greatest ska albums of all time."
5,"SOLID, FIRST-RATE POP/SKA","My band (The Existors) opened for JFC in Poulsbo, WA. We had also seen them open for RBF the previous night. They are great. I really enjoy their music (as do the rest of the Existors). For some strange reason I wasn't that impressed with them until I got the cd and listened to them. Then I instantly fell in love. (sometimes live performances don't reflect a bands true talents) If you enjoy bands in a similar (sort of) vein such as Reel Big Fish, Five Iron Frenzy, etc., you will definitely love JFC's tunes. TO JFC: Hey guys, we would be honored to play with you again sometime. You ROCK! (and we would like to rock in your general vicinity)"
3,wait for the next release,"I'll keep this book but it definitely can be improved. First off, the programs on the CD-ROM don't work. Second, the website where updated versions of the author's scripts can allegedly be found is dead. So for the high price ... you get useless programs and out-dated evals of SQLLab and SQLNavigator. Throughout the book there are boxes with bold text containing a tip or factual info. Why doesn't the author list all of these boxes at the end of each chapter or in an appendix for easy viewing?? This book would be 100% more user-friendly if he did that (the tips are usually pretty good). As it is now, you have to stumble page-by-page searching for relevant info and if you're lucky you'll find something. Fortunately the info is decent once you find it."
5,The best Oracle SQL Tuning book available,"I do a lot of SQL tuning for Oracle. This book is the best book I have read in this subject. It is not bias, it is clear, easy to understand, with good practical examples. It is written for a truly expert in Oracle SQL tuning. Using plain english the author explains a lot of concepts that are fundamental for a successful SQL tuning effort. I read the 1st edition more than once, and I am reading the 2nd edition for the second time. If you already have the first edition, it is worth to purchase the second edition that has been updated and feeded with additional elements. If you only have the time to read one book in Oracle SQL tuning, this is your book."
2,"Ridiculously Overpriced, but OK Book","This book would be great at 1/10th of its current price. It is obscene to charge this price for what you get. It has some decent information in it, but be prepared to pay 10X its value."
5,Very Helpful Guide,"I found this guide very helpful when I started my private partnership. It is written by professionals who know very well the subject. It will be very valuable to anyone who is considering starting his own private partnership, particularly in the financial sector."
1,WRONG picture!,The picture is of the rear seat but the product sent to us is the front seats! Fabric is great but didn't try to put it on b/c we don't need the front seat covers.
4,"Good cookies, good price.","I might be a little strange but I can't get enough fortune cookies. If you need them in bulk like me this is a pretty good deal. Flavor is good, crispy, and individually wrapped. Fortunes are average and have lotto numbers on each one."
5,Wonderful Basket,The first basket we purchased (not from this company) had a problem with the bottom door staying shut which really sucked the first time we raised it out of the water and the first were escaping out the bottom. But not this basket. The bottom is secure and it appears to be well made.
1,This brings Star wars to shame,When i read this book i could barely keep up with most of the boring dialouge. And thier is so many things that dont make sense compared to the SW movies (ex. Leia has no power in the force) that I just couldnt read the rest it disgusted me... If you like SW and dont care about how it follows up with the other episodes than you might like this book....I didn't
1,DO NOT READ!!!,"Not worth reading unless you actually need to know everything there is to know about star wars. This takes place between A New Hope & The Empire Strike Back. Lets face it, between those two time periods Luke had no more control over the force than an acorn & somehow in this book he is not only able to stand up to Vader & live but actually win in a saber duel. I mean come on, even those little Padawans in episode 2 could have killed Luke. With all that aside I say this is a horrible book, a disgrace to Star Wars & a shame that it was ever written. I give this book one star & im even being generous with that."
1,Oh brother! (insert eye roll),"I have read almost every Star Wars book out there and this was the worst, ok maybe tied with The Crystal Star. I can't believe all the great reviews this got. It seems like the characters personalities kept changing throughout the book. Also, although Luke just got a few lesson from Kenobi and had not even been to see Yoda yet, somehow he has this tremendous skill with a lightsaber. Oh please. This is the only Star Wars book that I actually threw away."
1,what a turd,"This is the wost SW book I have eve read. It was so bad, I did something I hardly ever do, stopped reading it. I realize when this was written, but am baffled that Lucas let it ever see the light of day."
3,An interesting view of what could happen after Star Wars.,"I liked this book for what it is, one person's view of what happened after Star Wars. You have to look at this book realising that the other two movies were not out. With that in mind, the story was good and could be believed. The book is well written. A Star Wars fan might want to pick apart the minor details that come to light later in the series, and those that do probably won't enjoy this book."
4,"quick book, very enjoyable to read",This is a classic star wars book. Like how they involved vader but the book would have been fine without him
2,Just for collectors,"The plot is not that interesting, the characters are badly developed (Luke acts more like Han with the Force than anything, for instance) and I had to force myself to finish it."
2,Not bad. Not good either.,"This book takes place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. It was interesting, but not the best by far. Leia, escorted by Luke, was on her way to Circarpous to enlist their Rebel underground in the battle against the Empire. Thier ships crash on a jungle planet known as Mimban. Hidden on the planet was a crystal that had controlable power over the force. Now, with Vader on the planet, Luke and Leia have to race to find it. Along with the two droids, their new friend Halla, and two Yuzzems.In this book, you can tell Luke and Leia have a strong connection with each other. They pretty much stay in character, except they act like a bunch of little kids. Han Solo and Chewbacca are left out. Which was dissapointing to me, since Han is my favorite character. All in all, this was a decent book that all fans should read."
4,"For 1978, it's good.","For a book written in 1978, it's great. Foster does a tremendous job of writing for only having ANH to go on. I especially liked Luke in this book. Foster matured him, made him more of a man. No longer is he a whiney farmboy, but a heroic escort of Princess Leia. His only thoughts are of protecting her, and his other new friends he meets along the way. However, I did find Leia to be just awful. Forster totally misinterpretted her character and made her a whimpy, bossy pain. While the plot isn't incredibley exciting, it's just enough to keep you interested."
2,Way too unrealistic,"The book starts off as realistic and normal, as one would expect after A New Hope. By the end, it is completely unrealistic. There is no way things would take place as they did. Vader being so emotional? Never. While he was more emotional in A New Hope than any other time, he still was far colder than shown here. In Empire, Vader is pure darkness and evil, perhaps shown best when he jumps down at Luke during their duel, flying from above, like a dark raven. He has almost no dialogue in comparison, and the thought of him doing and saying all he did in Mind's Eye is not realistic. Vader did not seem all that strong in Mind's Eye, and Luke and Leia seemed stronger than they should have. In reality, Vader could have cut all of them up almost instantly. Luke had almost no training, and Leia none. Way too unrealistic."
4,Overall: Very well written.,"Foster did make some minor inconsistensies with the Star Wars universe, but the novel itself makes up for the small mix-ups. Foster didn't know there was even an ""Empire Strikes Back"" coming. SW seemed to be a one-shot deal. Foster took the basic undercurrent and spirit of ""SW: A New Hope"" and made a great novel, with SW or standing alone."
3,Interesting Elements,"I can see why critics would diapprove of this book; it doesn't seem to warrant its ""official"" status. However, the story itself is quite an interesting look at the Force, and you can still reason out all the story elements that are seemingly incongruent to the Star Wars universe by saying that the character developments (for example) in this book are an extrapolation of those in A New Hope, and that when The Empire Strikes Back came out, their development took a slightly different turn."
2,BEAUTIFUL COVER ART,"I read this novel the instant it came out. Everyone was starving for more Star Wars. Most of us mistakenly thought the sequel to the movie was going to be based on this book, but happily, it wasn't. Its been many years since I read this book but I distinctly remember feeling it was all wrong. The stakes in this story are very small. HOWEVER, in spite of not liking the book, I still have it on my bookshelf twenty years later, because the cover art is AWESOME! It was the coolest star wars illustration around at the time, and still is a classic. there have been several covers for this novel, but the one I had featured a silhouette of Darth against a foggy forest, with Luke and Leia cowering in the foreground by a glowing red crystal. Save yourself the money, and just do a google search and look at the cover. Its very cool!"
4,The Seventh Trumpet,"As a Civil War know-nothing, I found The Seventh Trumpet both educational and inciteful. The organization-- by calandar dates-- is clever and helps the reader locate the events in their historical context.Set against a backdrop of real Civil War events, it's fast-moving but left me with a real sense of what life must have been like in the South, how people thought, and how those thoughts translated into action-- or inaction, as the case may be, and how the stage was set for the new generations.Frye's writing is crisp but descriptive and moving."
5,Outstanding Civil War book,"I thoroughly enjoyed Judge Frye's book about the fictional General Page, whose character was based on that of General William Pendleton. Gen. Pendleton was the rector of All Saints' Episcopal Church in Frederick, MD, but who left the parish after an argument with the members of the vestry over the construction of a new church building. He did become the one of Gen. Lee's staff officers, as the head of artillery of the Army of Northern Virginia. Nevertheless, Judge Frye's sensitive portrayal of a conflicted man, husband, father, and officer touched me deeply."
5,A Baby Book,"We received an earlier addition of this book for our son before he was born. It is one of the best baby books that we have seen. It allowed us to journal and to document things about the pregnancy, ultrasound, first holidays, growing chart, firsts and express our thoughts on what he would be like. It was nice to be able to have specific pages to document his life even before he was born. Most baby books start at birth, this one starts at conception."
2,Average to poor radio / poor clock features,"Purchased from Amazon on sale for $40.00. I own two Tivoli Model Ones and a Bose Waveradio II and a Grundig S350DL (an Eton). The sound and reception on this radio is not comparable to any of the above radios. The Tivoli Model One is close to the same form factor but is miles better in terms of sound and the radio. Of course you lose the remote / presets / clock function.Pros: Cheap if purchased on sale.Small form factor.Slim remote - similar to what is included with the Bose Waveradio II.Battery backup.Cons: Poor sound.Average to poor reception.LCD backlighting is not adjustable, may be a problem if used as a nightstand radio.Minimal clock functions (very small snooze buttons, alarm options, etc)."
4,Plesent radio,Bought this radio back in April and placed it in the kitchen. We run it for hours at a time and it sounds just fine we like it. Remote is nice to have also. I cranked up the volume to see if will distort the sound and it did not. Some people would like to see bass and treble controls it would be nice but this unit is not competeing with high end stereo units as I said it sounds good. As for the light in the display at night it is somewhat bright. In the kitchen we do not notice it or we grown use to it. I gave 4 stars because it could use a few more station presets. Buy it when it is on sell and I think it is a good deal.
3,annoying display light,"The audio quality and reception are very good, and are certainly a big improvement over the standard clock radio that it replaced for me, but the blue beacon light coming from the display is TRULY ANNOYING, and I'm not sure I would have bought it if I had realized how aweful the light would be in the nighttime bedroom. I have to cover it with an envelope to survive it. Eton SHOULD do something about the display. Ideal would be control of light intensity, as well as what information is shown (currently, the station frequency shows in big characters when the radio is turned on, but the time is so small that it can't be read if you are several feet away). If we can order customized computers for under $1000, why can't someone build the radio I want for under $100? Remember, you heard it first here...."
3,Decent but boomy,"I purchased this radio for $40 on sale, and that price one should not complain. (And from the good reviews here it is just possible that the batches are of uneven quality.) But if this is anyone's idea of ""high fidelity"" sound, they are used to explosive boom boxes or cars with street-demolishing subwoofers. The bass is cranked up too high to be pleasing for voice: I listen to NPR mostly, and sometimes classical. What I did was put some duct tape over the rear bass port: this is an odd solution for a radio that sells for $150 and pretends to sonic fidelity. No tone control is preposterous at that price point. The tuner is only fair; we are 25 miles from Chicago, and some stations are not strong. My small Grundig (Eton) shortwave radio pulls in stations 50 miles away. Still, handsome, convenient with the remote,and a good deal on sale. But don't pay full price."
1,AWFUL sound quality,"While this unit looks nice, it sounds awful. The bass is pumped way up and there is no way to turn it down. The result is that I can not understand voices on the radio and music sounds AWFUL. While I do not expect much from what is really just a clock radio, this is worst I have ever heard in a radio.In addition, instead of having the power cord connect direct to this radio, they use an external ""wall wart"", which is so large it covers both of the AC outlets when it is connected.I am returning this it is so bad. If you do try to buy this, do not pay over the $30 to $40 that it gets put on sale for."
1,Falls very short of promises,"This radio alarm clock is decidedly second rate. It is had to program, cheap feeling and even lacks a dimming feature for the LED, a feature that is essential for a clock radio that has an alarm feature. Stay away, there are much better options available for less money and from better names."
1,"way overpriced, plastic cheap feel to it, average tuner.",Not much to say here other than you can do much better with much less. I am a radio collector and right now you can do much better with a Sangean WR-1 or WR-2. This radio feels cheap and has an external power supply. Sound is about the same as a $25 no name unit you can buy at any department store.
3,"Bright Light, bright light!","First, I should say that I am, overall, very happy with this radio. The reception is great, the sound is deep, the remote very helpful, and combined with the ability to set it to turn off in 15 minute increments while I fall asleep listening to NPR is a huge plus. But, there is one downside to this unit.I would recommend against placing it next to your bed angled toward you if you plan on actually sleeping; the display is pretty darn bright.I've walked into my room and not needed to turn any lights on; easily guiding myself around my furniture by the light of the display alone. And, if you start fiddling with the settings, the displays turns even brighter, my eyes adjusting a bit before continuing. But, I won't give up my Eton! So, for now, a Radiohead jewel case finds itself sitting high and dry against the Eaton's display window each night."
4,Eton Sound 100,I got this radio from Amazon when it was on sale (gold box deal). I've been using it to listen to AM/FM stations as well as connect my MP3 player to it. Overall I am happy with the purchase. Some of the pros and cons of this unit are:Pros:Excellent AM and FM receptionI do like the design and styling (I got the silver version)RemoteAux inputAudio quality is good for a unit this sizeCons:No EQ/Tone controlCan not use external antenna or wire antenna
2,The worst sound combined with a decent design.,"The design is decent although the display is barely readable. Reception is satisfying. The deal breaker is the dull sound which cannot be adjusted. How dumb to save a couple of bugs, Eton! No comparison to Model One from Kloss! The $10 radio-clock of my father sounds better than this unit."
2,fashion over function,"i couldn't sleep with this thing in my room...display was too bright and could not be adjusted...also, why would they not put bass/treble buttons on this radio...and its way too bass heavy (and i love bass!)...i often listen to talk radio in the morning...couldn't understand what was being said through this radio...just a low rumble that resembled a voiceit is definitely a nice looking radio; unfortunately the plastic housing and buttons feel really cheapi ended up returning this for the boston acoustics horizon solo...this radio is exactly what i had hoped the eaton would be...i highly recommend!"
4,awesome,"i love this alarm clock i wake up to the radio every morning, its pretty small but it sounds like a stereo! i love the sorta retro/modern design too."
2,FLAKES,"I follow the Curly Girl method ([...]) &Curly Girl: The Handbook, and I thought this would be a good gel to try over my leave-in conditioner on my wet hair (post-shower). While it has a powerful hold that gave me great curl definition, it left flakes within a few hours. Just like a previous reviewer said, some of my hair was so full of flakes, that one of my co-workers thought I had developed white hair over night. I was too embarrassed to correct her. I am glad this was cheap because it is going in the trash."
2,Hold firm but leave you with lots of flakes,"after maybe 5 or 6 hours, the gel turn into flakes, and there are lots of flake on your hair. It like it snows outside. It does hold firm though, if it doesn't have the flake problem it would be great."
1,TERRIBLE GEL!,"I absolutely HATE this gel! LA Looks gels are VERY FLAKY and do not hold well. I am in the military and have to use hair gel every day to put my hair in a slicked back bun. This gel dries out my hair and is much more flaky than any other gel I have used. If you are looking for a good styling gel, ECO Styler Krystal is amazing!"
1,Weak and flaky,"i put it on once and in a few hours later it was gone and flaky, its going back to rite aid, dont even try to by this junk.."
2,Not for Xtreme hair styles...,It doesn't keep it's hold for very long. Would never buy again. No wonder it's so cheap!
3,its strong but flaky,this is a pretty good gel. its strong and holds for a while. the only thing about it is that it is flaky.. its at a low price and i would recomend it for people who dont want to pay alot of money
3,FYI,"So i bought this spark arrestor for my 02 YZ250F Yoshi TRS tri-oval slip-on exhaust and it didn't fit. The collar that is welded around the shaft is way to big to fit in the exhaust cone. Anyway I was in a rush to ride the next day and returning the item was not an option, so i ground down the collar until i could shove it in my exhaust and be able to put the exhaust cap on. It took me a while but i finally got it in there. The name of the product is very deceiving. I have a TRS model exhaust but it wouldn't fit. Other than that it is put together well and looks sturdy."
4,A gift to our world,"Rosenberg provides here a direct contribution to peace building, in our hearts, with the people around us and by reverberation, all around the world. It is an important work that has its roots in the universal wisdom that connects our human history sometimes with strong threads, sometimes with thinner ones. In a few words, it is a remarquable work, in spirit and in reality. The only thing missing is a booklet, a workbook that would support the practice and exploration suggested in the audio cd. I highly recommand it."
4,Enjoyed with some small caveats,"I enjoyed many parts of the book, especially the common theme of becoming much more intentional in how you communicate your needs to others. I did find that some of the practices suggested by Rosenberg may not always be practical with the population of people in my practice as well as for my own personal style of practice. It is, however, definitely worth reading."
3,Kindle NVC,A useful book but worksheets in Kindle format don't really work. Kindle edition needs to significantly cheaper. I wish I'd bought hard copy
3,The foreign language translation was better !,"I first came across Rosenberg's book on Nonviolent Communication in the form of its Dutch translation. Because I initially liked it and because I am much more fluent in English, I decided to order the original version in English. My goal was to acquire a manual on how to communicate more effectively in private life. The new copy (second edition, paperback) is full of abbreviations and full of marketing statements about all the wonderful things Nonviolent Communication supposedly does for you. Superficially, the book sounds great. However, applying the technique of Nonviolent Communication day to day is much more difficult than it seems. In hindsight, I got sold on the promise of the book, and I awoke with a much more difficult topic than I thought."
1,"Poorly written, self-aggrandizing babble","As a doctor of psychology, I was appalled at the short-sightedness of this book. How can a person peddle this gibberish? Rosenberg pushes ""correct"" speaking instead of honest, open dialogue. Watch one of his videos, and you can see the pickiness of language he insists upon. I would never recommend this book to a client. I strongly suggest you consider the credibility (or lack thereof) of this author before pushing this dribble on another person."
3,Helpful to all relationships,Some valuable insights into giving and receiving communication. Helpful in understanding the way we communicate ourselves to others.
4,Excellent book for all!,"Literally, anyone who speaks could benefit from reading this book! It helps us to realize not only the power of words but how to choose them better and ultimately enhance both communication and relationships! Highly recommended! :)"
5,"Positively, irrevocably changed my life!","I can't rate this book high enough!This book taught me how to both think, talk and listen in the most constructive ways I had never even thought about before. I think it's positively changed my life for the better!Every single person on the planet should not only read this book but honestly attempt, daily, to engage in nothing but Nonviolent Communication!"
5,Non Violent Communication: Opinion,"I am really enjoying this book.I feel that young people (18 and under) should read this book as well, because I am currently 18. It contains valuable information that is helpful for everyday life. I am currently trying to practice the NVC process, sometimes I forget but It is a nice book! I tell everyone, even my friends about the book, It makes you look at life a different way, instead of out for wants in life, it is all about your needs and other people. If all the people in the world have this book and practice, the world will be a BETTER place!!"
4,Very helpful despite the hokey presentation,"The book is somewhat corny, the examples border on ridiculous at times.But, I was trying it out with my husband. It was like a miracle. The minute I would use the techniques we would stop fighting, we began to express our affection for each other and were able to talk about things we'd never talked about before. The minute I would stop using it, we would start fighting again. I have taken conversations that were headed for the dumps, starting using these techniques and ended up with a very useful bonding experience. My husband won't try it though because when he read the book, he thought it sounded so stupid. But, he is sort of picking up the techniques I think from copying me."
5,will change your life,"Im still listening to this but all I can say is wow. It will really put your mind, your thinking in a better place. It will definitley change your life positively if you let it. The author speaks eloquently and simply to get the message across very clearly..all i kept thinking was this should be required education in school. a real gem."
5,non violent comunication,just an incredible book to have in everyone's household. just imagine if we all could communicate in more productive way without all of this chaos in relationships with spouses? children? family members? co-workers? Wow!! what a better place we would live in!!!!!!!
4,"Nonviolent Communication, A Language of Life","Marshall Rosenberg explains in easily readable form how human interaction can move from confrontative, argumentative win-lose battles to productive, mutual problem solving conversations. HIs methods can be successful in everything from family interactions to international conflict. I strongly recommend it for those who want to improve their own communication skills as well as those who would like techniques for facilitating productive conversations for those in conflict."
4,MUST READ,"This book is a wonderful read.I love the premise but the actual implementation is a little tricky! They have trainers available it would be better with more roll playing,but being able to communicate and really articulate what you want out of life or a conversation is so inspiring. If you can master this book you can enrich your life beyond your dreams!"
4,"Easy to read, difficult to implement",I went to an NVC information session and am reading the book for the first time. I will take the presenter's advice and read it 2 more times. I really need to learn NVC and would benefit from using it in all areas of my life. The process seems like it will be difficult to learn to implement in a way that seems natural and effortless. I hope to be able to attend practice sessions to help integrate the principles into my life.
2,thin and flimsy,"I thought this would be good-quality since it was not inexpensive. The design is cool but don't expect a plush, absorbent towel."
2,too expensive for a piece of one-time-use plastic,"1- To use rubber straps you have to completely destroy the elastic ones, because they are permanently attached to the headlamp base.2- The plastic notch that is holding the lamp in the tilted position is flimsy.3- No instructions.Does not justify the price, I am very disappointed.Edit: (1) above is not correct, you can remove elastic straps easily... But this is what the instructions for."
4,Not the tip I needed but still a good tip!,"Wilton is always a good brand to buy when it comes to sturdy tips that won't rust. However, if you are like me and trying to make your cupcakes look like DC cupcakes ""signature swirl"" you need #1A. I found that out the hard way!"
4,Not for the beginner,This is a focused book for the initiated. But a very complete compillation. Focuses on values.
5,The Very Best of Henry Mancini,This cd has brought back many fond memories of the great Henry Mancini music I listened to while growing up. It is simply outstanding work!!
2,Mancini,The info on the CD when ripped to media player is in Asian. No English on CD info. It did not explain that on description. I was not pleased at ALL! You get what you pay for.
3,"Well, Peter Gunn was good","This is worth buying just for Peter Gunn, but I really hoped the rest would be better than it is. After a while, I started feeling like I was on a long elevator ride. I still gave it 3 stars after reminding myself that this stuff was designed to be played in the background."
2,[dollar amount] per page,"Including the covers, this pamphlet consists of ten sheets of paper. Three of those sheets contain useful information about Dublin Core. The rest is ISO cruft.Don't even think about wasting your money. Go to the Dublin Core site ... You may not find a list of NISO Voting Members there, but you'll find as much info about Dublin Core as in this flyer, and much more.(I would have it rated it 1 star, but I assume the information it contains is basically correct, so 2 it is.)"
3,Seriously overpriced,"$8.00 + $8.00 shipping? I just got this exact model at my local grocery store for $3.00! What a rip-off!The pie plate is nice, but what's with the price gouging? I don't believe that retail price for a minute."
2,A few clunky features,"While the visual styling of the pack is nice, there are a few features that don't function as well. The waist strap is a little too thin for comfort. The elastic bands to adjust the length of the waist band don't stay in place and almost every time you take the pack on or off you must readjust it. The water bottle holder is too short and if you shift your weight sharply or bend over, the bottle falls out. I had to attach the bottle cap strap to the top handle of the pack with a carabiner to compensate. When full, the water bottle holder unbalances the pack to one side, which is a little annoying for longer walks. I wouldn't recommend the product."
4,Pay no attention to pic - lids are red,"Pay no attention to pic - lids are red. However, very useful size especially for freezing ""couple"" sized quantities of cream based sauces & quacamole (defrost slowly in warm water NOT microwave). PS...to avoid staining, first clean with COLD water. After it appears clean, use hot H2O."
3,Good poetry handbook,"Good and detailed book providing the advanced reader/poet with many information. As the title says a real encyclopaedia. One problem is that it is suitable only for very advanced readers and professional poets. Common readers will find difficulties. One more disadvantage is that the book is printed with very small font, making it difficult and tiring while reading. Good as a reference but difficult to use otherwise. It is recommended for experienced readers with poetry and poetics. Other people will be able to find everything but they will end up to find nothing. They should try something simpler."
5,Excellence maintained in the update,"I have been using this excellent reference book for over three decades, and dozens of my students have acquired it. The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics retains the virtues of the original edition but adds extensively to it in order to deal with the profound changes in critical practice that took place since the structural revolution. The entries are clear and dependable, and the book remains a precious compendium of critical concepts to be visited systematically in order to make sure one is on the right path, and given valuable keys to further reading."
1,help,"I was raised on the original recording ,1982 version. This is sooo noisy and fast. Way too much back ground cymbals and the pace feels so rushed, like the women are singing for volumne and power.does anyone have a cd copy of the original, calmer tape?"
4,"Lighthearted, campy fun","This is a sweet little gem I'd never heard of before doing an Amazon search. Walter Matthau's adorable naive performance as a rookie in the cheating lifestyle is complemented by cameos from some of the best-known stars of the time. My favorite was a couple played by Lucille Ball and Art Carney.This movie made me smile from beginning to end. It was more clever than laugh-out-loud funny like the Sunshine Boys.One caveat: the movie, made in 1967, is very dated. All women in the movie are portrayed as va-va voom sex objects, obedient faithful wives or occasionally as vindictive and money grabbing opportunists. As a feminist I was able to overlook this and enjoy the film. But if over-the-top sexism will ruin your enjoyment, pick another of the dozens of hilarious Walter Matthau movies on Amazon."
3,I've seen better,"I love a good Matthau film and was excited by the cast of comedians. When I saw this one though, I thought it was kind of dumb. Maybe dumb/silly. Not a lot of re-watch value. It has some very sixties styles and cars. My dad got a kick out of the Dodge Dart.One of the youngest Matthau movies I've seen"
4,Not top drawer - but close.,"This movie lacks only one thing - believeability. The acting, especially by Mattheu, is tremendous but the storyline leaves one shaking one's head. I am aware that fantasy and 'stretching the point' is acceptable in films, but somehow, one hopes for better when Mattheu is involved.It is good enough entertainment, but I feel unable to grant the movie any more than four stars - it would have been three stars, except for Mattheu's performance."
4,Too Many Laughs,"I first saw this movie on TV in the mid 60's. My wife and I laughed and snickered through the whole thing. Then I saw it again, a few years later, while in VietNam. That was a real hoot with a bunch of guys watching and reacting. Some 35 or more years later, I remembered it and just had to have a copy for myself. The entire movie, about how to cheat on your wife and not get caught, is chock full of cameos by readily recognizable stars acting out little scenarios as Robert Morse explains how to go about things to Walter Matthau. It's a light no-brainer, full of amusing surprises, for aspiring cheats who will have no clue what happens at the very end!"
5,"Classic comedy, don' t make em like this anymore!","Matthau was a comic genius, this movie has a bunch of great comic guest appearances! I laughed my potootie off! Have seen the movie a bunch of times, but Matthau has always been one of my favorite comics with his rubber face, and basset hound looks. Numerous memorable scenes, one of my favorites is the one in the supermarket with the cantelopes. This is a real funny, movie about sex without being dirty. They knew how to make great movies when this film was made. Where did you get those big eyelashes? :-) Art Carney is wonderfully funny as the construction worker, Ben Blue is great. Lucille Ball is fairly good."
5,This should be your guide,"In the early 60s, Hollywood produced a series of sex comedies, including the Doris Day/Rock Hudson films, but this film, along with How to Murder Your Wife, is the penultimate expression of that aesthetic (The Odd Couple sort of closes the genre). Gene Kelly deserves more credit as a director for this brilliant film, which is closer to Restoration Comedy than Hollywood. Brilliantly acted, full of genuinely funny comic routines (in the age of the unfunny SNL skit, people may have forgotten that comedy is supposed to be funny, not painful). I can't recommend this film enough. A genuine gem of a comedy."
5,YOUR ROOM plays in my room,"I've been playing this album over and over. This is honest country music. As a big fan of Mark Chestnut and having heard him performLIVE this album is so close to being at a real concert. Actually its better because unlike a crowded, noisy concert, here you get himplaying, singing with great back up musicians in a LIVE & STUDIO or CONCERT HALL set up at the same time. Best of all worlds. To get thehighest quality playback you do have to have a Blu-ray and a current 5. 1 or better sound set up. This ain't mono, or even stereo. This isstate of the art recording with really good 3 D video. I saw it at a friend's place in 3 D, don't have the 3 D myself yet, but you don't needthe 3 D TV, it looks and sounds fantastic without it."
2,Too much monkey business,"The original Suicide Kings disbanded shortly after the release of their vinyl EP in 1986.Apparently vocalist Pinky went on to record several solo songs with various Sunset Strip types attempting an early rock 'n' roll sound.These songs make up the majority of this album.To justify calling this the Suicide Kings,a few poorly recorded live tracks from 1986 with original guitarist""Machine Gun Mike""Crescione,whose face also appears in an old photo on the cover,have been included.This album is very similar to a Polish bootleg from years ago called ""Suicide Kings-High and Mighty"".I suspect from the weird liner notes that this was also put together by a foreigner who was unfamiliar with the band.If you're a fan of the original group with Pinky,Machine Gun Mike,Larry and Jeff,you might be interested in the album ""50 Suicide Kings fans can't be wrong"" which came out in 2002."
1,useless,"waste of money, does not give practical ideas like the description suggests, nice pictures, but useless in home decorating"
3,"This book's ""ah-ha"" moment reads more like a ""ho-hum"" reminder memo","Some books spend a lot of time and waste a lot of ink promising new insight, but ultimately they end up telling you something you already know. One such book is ""A Bias For Action"" by leadership expert Heike Bruch and management expert Sumantra Ghoshal. The big ""ah-ha"" moment of the book is where the authors state that their research has found that the willpower of an individual is a critical element in that individual's success - hmmm....that sounds more like a ""ho-hum"" moment that could have been divined by common sense rather than independent research. Despite the book's over-promised-under-delivered haze, there are some potentially useful strategies the authors offer to spur individual and collective willpower. You might want to pick it up for that reason alone. However, the problem is that those who might really benefit from this book probably lack the willpower to read it in the first place."
4,"Fashonable, but more antique than pictured","These have the trendy pre-cut-and-repaired ""blemishes"" - but Unionbay didn't go over-board, which is good. Also, the product page for these jeans doesn't say it, but you should wash these immediately after recieving them as the dye can rub off on other clothes or on itself if you leave it crumpled on the floor.These jeans look good and fit very well. Good buy."
1,deceptive advertising,These stars are TINY and the photo made them look quite a bit bigger. I am unlikely to return such a cheap item but I wont buy from this seller again.
2,Could not fine replacement bulbs,"Bought this for my wife, had it for about 6 months, the bulbs burned out and I looked everywhere to fine replacements and none..had trouble with the stand staying screwed tight. If I could fine the bulbs, I would probabley give it a 4 star...but with no light it isn't much good.."
2,A bit disappointed ...,"I had read all the reviews before ordering this product, so maybe I should have thought about it twice. As the reviews mention, the light around the mirror is virtually non-existent - in fact, you won't notice the light is on unless the room is totally dark! I thought that maybe the people who wrote those reviews were expecting salon-level light and I thought I'd be fine with just a reasonable amount of light, but this mirror is virtually no different from my old one, which did not have a light.I should mention that it is sturdy and the magnification is quite good, so I'm torn between wanting to keep it and being so frustrated with the fact that it has no lighting to speak of. In the end, I will have to return it as it does not serve the purpose of a lighted table mirror. If lighting is not important to you, you will likely have no issues with this mirror."
1,decorative use mirror only,"beautiful design, but of no use if you need it to also provide light, because the 15 watt bulb provides minimal light -- and the manufacturer says you cannot replace with higher watts."
2,Looks good but disappointing,"This mirror LOOKS fabulous!!! But the light is not bright enough to ""see"" by and the magnification is just ok.I had tried a 5x and it was not strong enough, apparently a 6x isn't either. It's tough to see up close as you get older :)I think, for those over forty with close-up vision problems, you'd be happier with a 10x mirror.Still, if close up is not an issue for you, this is a great purchase. You just might want to replace the bulb for something brighter."
2,Part was not what we ordered,The finish we wanted was to be polished brass but it was a dull color and the material was not polished brass. We appreciated your cooperative adjustment on our order.
2,Light did not work,"Unfortunately, the light on this mirror did not work and was returned to the seller who did not have a replacement. It was a Christmas gift for our mother and I'm now shopping for another lighted mirror. Will look at other Jerdon mirrors as they seem to have good ratings and evaluations."
3,Very heavy duty lock,"As others have noted this is a very heavy lock. The pictures and description on Amazon are deceiving. Beware that if you plan to carry this thing around you will get a workout and it will eventually rip a hole in whatever bag you put it in. It's enormous, the cable is about the same diameter as a quarter and it feels like it's made of lead. You could easily knock someone out with it, assuming you are strong enough to swing it around. I had to return this because it was way bigger and heavier than anything I want to carry around."
4,Pretty good lock.,"I've had the lock for about a month and so far, so good. It IS heavy (I had read the reviews, but was still surprised). It is pretty large in circumference. It allows you to lock to large poles, which is nice. If you're locking to something smaller, it might be best to loop it around twice, which is hard to do b/c it's so thick and not that flexible."
4,heavy-duty and ... heavy,"I bought this to replace my old well-used armoured lock. The Rottweiler 5024 is thicker and longer (it looks much more modest on the product image, where it is scaled to the same size as their shorter models) and probably better suited to secure motorcycles than bicycles, which is what I use it for. If it were a foot shorter (and correspondingly lighter) it would be perfect for me. I got used to it though. The extra length can be useful when securing both frame and a tyre to, for instance, a bulky pole or a tree. Did I mention that it's heavy? 3.5lb."
3,"Great item, seller not so much.","This is the 4 foot cable, NOT THE 5.5 FOOT. It's too short to carry over a shoulder, and too heavy to carry on the bike. I returned it to the seller after doing NOTHING but sizing it, and 4 feet is too short to wrap around my front wheel, frame, & rear wheel - so it's too short to secure a 700c tired bike. I was charged a 20% restocking fee, and the cable lock was unused.BTW: this isn't a cable lock that OnGuard will give you insurance for your bike with. I'd recommend another lock by them, as they will reimburse you for the cost of your bike if it gets stolen while using an INSURED LOCK!!!PS: the seller isn't clear about the specs of this lock, and I don't hold Amazon responsible. Buyer beware,..."
2,I heard rumours he was a good writer.....,"I read a lot of Mysteries and Thrillers by Connolly, Lehane, Burke, Hiassen, Sandford, etc., etc., and I have always heard very good things about LeCarre. While reading this book, I thought perhaps he was too ""sophisticated"" for my tastes, and that I didn't get it. Wrong. It was just tedious. LeCarre decides to change directions in the story, and does an exceptionally poor job of setting it up. Hey, lets just hop over to Russia from Turkey, and nobody will ever know we are there. Gimme a break. I was hoping in the end that everyone would get shot. I'd hate to think this book may reproduce a sequal. I'll stick to stories about good ole U.S. gumshoes and Florida freaks. Sophistication is not all it is hyped up to be."
1,Badly needs an editor,"This book is a jumble, much longer than it had to be, filled with extraneous (and useless) detail. It simply does not grab your attention and carry you forward like Le Carre's earlier books did. You get sidetracked by the detail, which does not add anything to the story line. I wound up attempting to skim the most egregious parts because they were so boring. This book could have used a strong editor to force Le Carre to re-write and focus the story line. If you loved Le Carre's spy stories, you're going to be very disappointed with this attempt. I sure hope his next book is better."
1,Single & Single,I'm 60 pages into this book & one word seems to fit: OBTUSE. Perhaps if someone has the patience to sit down & blast past the jumbled first chapters in one sitting it will make more sense. I haven't read anything by LeCarre before & got this as a Christmas present. I also have a speed reading course I want to take & think I will use this book as fodder for the course.
5,As good as it gets !!!,Single & Single is vintage Le Carre.In light of his previous work 'The Tailor of Panama' which was a big let down the present work comes as a solid proof that the master is still alive and kicking. This is a collage of his earlier work (no doubt about that!) and says something more that is as incisive and truthful as only Le Carre can write. The beginning of the book is a winner and the character of Alfred Winser keeps haunting the reader throughout the book only on the basis of that brief appearance. I would strongly recomment this book to all those who feel the need to understand (realise?) one's own psyche.
4,Virgil would have been proud ...,"!Yes, the ancient Roman poet and propagandist would have approved of this novel.One of the other reviewers of this book on this site asks if it is necessary to trudge through a morass of introspective self-analyisis in this novel ... the answer is: if you think not, then you are missing the point (of literature generally, probably).Virgil, too, started one of his ""more famous works"" by telling his readers he was writing of ""Arms and the man""; and it was left unfinished - at the point where the hero kills an enemy who has stolen his armour - having first been through a metaphoric journey to the 'underworld'. Full stop/Period.Let's hope that we get more from Mr. Cornwell soon ..."
1,Could not be more disappointed,"I am a big fan of thrillers (Graham Greene, Robert Ludlum, Ken Follett, Frederick Forsyth)--doubly so if they are well-done literary thrillers, so you can imagine my excitement when people recommended Le Carre to me as one of the great masters. So it was with great disappointment that I read Single & Single. The novel never rises above the conventional thriller: the predictable killings, the now mundane concept of the strained relationship between the protagonist and his father. Worse, and I admit that it might be just me, I found a lot of it ludicrous. Single detests his father and that lifestyle so much that he leaves it to become a clown and make animal balloons? Too bad that this was my first Le Carre novel (even my friends who are Le Carre fans told me that they didn't like this particular one). My friends tell me that I need to give one of his better novels, like Tinker, Sailor, Soldier, Spy a chance instead."
1,La Carre's worst effort. He must be exhausted.,"As a long time LaCarre fan who has read everything he has written since ""The Spy Who ..."", I was most disappointed in this one. It had nothing of interest: dull, dull, dull. There was not a single character that one could care about. Don't waste your time with this one!"
1,First time for Le Carre.........no mas!,"I found this book to be very hard to understand and to stay with. I read for enjoyment and relaxation. I didn't get either. I had to labor through 180 pages before I threw in the towel and the book in file 13. If you must read it, go to the library. At least you can take it back."
1,Glad it was a library borrow and did not purchase this book,"I am an old time LaCarre fan and eagerly await his new books. I have also enjoyed the challange of not having been spoon fed the content of his previous books, however this effort was beyond my understanding. Rather than repeat the comments of the previous negative reviews I thoroughly agree with most of them. It is interesting to note that the reviews are either 1 star are 5 stars,(few 3's),none in between, I wonder why?"
1,"Slow, tireing and no ending",I loved Le Carre's early works and the he went down hill and this one hit bottom. I finished this book looking for at least ten more pages. I thought the printer left them out.
3,somewhat tedious,"Though Mr Le Carre knows the complexities and the essence of the spy world probably more than any other author judging by his biography I think that though in Single & Single, he fully goes into these elements to make a story, he fails, unlike other spy authors, to provide ingenious twists and turns and credible suspense to make its work enticing leaving it somewhat dull. In addition, his writing style permanently changes its focus in every paragraph with places, characters and times, so sometimes it gets tiresome to follow him. The ending in this particular plot was prepared beforehand and made predictable, leaving a bit bitter taste on myself as a reader at the time I turned the last page. I have had great expectations when I purchased the book due to the reputation of Mr Le Carre, but they were not fulfilled, at least with Single & Single"
4,Corruption in new Russia,"With the exception of Le Carre's latest book, The Constant Gardener, I read all of his work. It is not the interesting stories Mr. LeCarre can tell you in his books, but also his excellent writing style that I personally find enjoyable. This book, however is a new kind of mystery novel. There are no spys, and it seems that every character in this book is more of a ""bad guy/gal"" than a good one. They are all looking to redeem themselves one way or another, but with no success. I enjoyed this book completely and recommend it to anyone as a good and interesting read. Go for it!"
4,A fascinating tour of the world of international corruption,"I hadn't picked up a Le Carre novel in years, but decided, after being urged on by my wife, to give this one a shot. I enjoyed it. Le Carre does an excellent job of delving into the schemes of the international lawyers, and bakers who support mafia operations worldwide. In doing so, he demonstrates that he is more than simply a spy novelist. Some readers may find the chronological shifts of the story to be jarring--especially if you tend to skim as I do when reading anything whatsoever. However, the story will make itself clear by the end of the book. I eagerly look forward to Mr. Le Carre's next literary venture."
4,A new and different Le Carre,"Single and Single portrays the consequences for Oliver Single after his crisis of conscience. Single is a trust lawyer, with his father, for an emerging Russian Mafia family. The novel thrusts Single into a cloak and dagger world where he attempts to rescue his estranged father, and uncover the conspiracy within the conspiracy of the Russia underworld.The novel maintains tight suspense, and yet addresses issues of personal ethics and family relations. The book is really a great read, the only drawback is the lack of development among woman's characters. This weakness has little impact on the story or the message, and like some others of Le Carre's books the main character propels the story into a thought provoking struggle between ideas, as much as a struggle between people."
2,Scattered audiotape,"This is a case where it doesn't seem quite fair to have an audiotape rating mixed in with the ratings of the print version. I might have liked the print version of the book assuming it filled it the gaping holes in the abridged tape. As it was, the tape was a frustrating experience in trying to keep track of a very large cast of characters; unexpected flashbacks; and sudden changes of scene. LeCarre's narration didn't help as he often spoke too softly.I'm not even sure if I can wrote coherently about the plot. Truely the tape was so scattered that I only have a mild sense of the complexities motivating Oliver. The rest of the characters, including some with terrific potential such as his father, are barely two-dimensional as abridged. I did manage to grasp that Oliver is torn between loyalties to his father and to the British government.Bottom-line: Maybe the print version is worth reading but avoid the tape."
3,How not to get rich in the post cold war world.,"Unlike the brilliant ""Our Game,"" ""Single and Single"" creates no meaningful connection between the its reader's life and the world of its characters; Oliver's big adventure (and Oedipal gratification) is good fun, but leaves the reader unchanged. The world is not a better place, the British Intelligence community is still run by uncaring accountants, but at least Oliver's loved ones are safe, he's gotten himself a girl, and Dad promises to be a better person. Shucks, I suppose he wasn't going to join the Chechen army, but I'd hoped for something more than a ride into the sunset."
2,Wait for the movie,LeCarre equals his performance in the Tailor of Panama. Finishing the book is an achievement.
2,an aborted takeoff,"Like an airliner taxiing around a foggy airport, Single and Single nears but never quite reaches the takeoff end of the runway. It revs its engines but fails to achieve the power required for takeoff. After several attempts to lift off it just shuts everything down and gets towed back to the terminal and deplanes its passengers. Maybe we'll go tomorrow"
1,Single & Single is Tedious & Tedious,"This book should be recommended reading for anyone suffering from insomnia. I could hardly stay awake after reading two or three pages. The characters have little depth. There isn't a likeable or sympathetic character in the book. While some critics might call this Le Carre's best novel in years, this might be because it is only slightly more interesting than anything he may have done in years. This book is next to impossible to read. I would characterize Le Carre's writing style as both tedious and boring. Much of the dialog is crytic and virtually incomprehensible. I found the plot only slightly more interesting than a Martha Stewart cookbook. I really felt cheated after reading this book in light of the hype that came with its publication. Reading this book is a waste of time."
5,Bravo!,"Besides being a good read with richly developed complex characters, this book has one aspect on which I'd like to commend Le Carre: his treatment of women. Yes, the female characters are a little flat, but compared to other, equally mature best selling authors--Tom Clancy comes to mind in particular--LC's women don't seem to me to fit superwoman stereotypes so readily. I had to congratulate the author here, especially given that he's from a generation of men who find modern women just puzzling. Aggie's nurturing side doesn't detract from her strengths; LC juxtaposes it with Oliver's equally nurturing tendencies in a scene in a Georgian house. Giving two women critical plot-altering victories while the men lie helpless? Unheard of in LC's generation. Good courage on his part."
4,Wonderful Character Relationships,"After finishing Lender's excellentTrojan Horse, I decided to go back and re-read this older LeCarre offering. The drawing of characters and their complex interrelationships of Trojan Horse are reminiscent of LeCarre's mastery in Single & Single. The complex psychology of Tiger and Oliver Single's father-son personal relationship is woven into the plot of this chilling, methodical story. This is not LeCarre's best story by far, but how he portrays the Tiger/Oliver relationship is as good as LeCarre can be, and worth the read."
3,A Good But Predictable Read,"A first time reader of a Le Carre novel, I found it intrigueing, yet predictable, and all too willing to rush through the finish. I enjoyed the developing of the characters and the first chapter was as good as I've ever read. I would recommend this book but I'm sure he has written some better ones. I hope I can find them."
4,Best LeCarre book in years,"LeCarre has recaptured the form he showed with the Smiley books by capturing the seedy side of trade with the gangsters in the former Soviet Union.Single & Single is a law firm in London that has ties to the Russian underworld. As the story unfolds, the younger Single travels to Moscow, Georgia and Istambul to do his father's bidding. He meets colorful characters in a book full of LeCarre's cerebral images.This is a must read for fans of the spy novel."
1,Single & Single Keeps You Waiting and Waiting...,"I am a major John LeCarre fan. His Cold War novels were unique in distilling the moral ambiguities of that age into the lives of his characters. Like some foreign policy professionals, he has not adapted well to the New World order. This novel is as disappointing as The Night Porter.The characters are underdeveloped, especially the women. All of them play the role required of them by the main character, without any inkling of why they might act that way. Most often, they provide the common sense the hero seems to lack, but why?There are plenty of war stories left in the Cold War. Perhaps LeCarre would do better to continue writing those. The post-Cold War era seems to have eluded him."
1,What a disappointment,"If LeCarre really is the author of this one, he has lost his touch. I agree with those reviewers who said such things as ""tendentious"", ""obtuse"", ""overly confusing"". I still have no idea how, where, when and why Oliver became a conjurer, nor do I really have a picture of him in my mind's eye. I was ever hopeful that the old LeCarre magic would show itself; what a disappointment that it never did. When I finished the book I threw it into the trashcan."
1,"confused, incomprehensible gibberish","this book has received oustanding reviews but it is confused ,pretentiuous writing. It appears that reviewers are impressed by Le Carree's incomprehensible writing."
1,"LeCarre may have talent, but he doesn't demonstrate it here.","Single and Single is a disjointed mass of words that surely doesn't represent the best of this author. This book should be sold with the warning to ""read without expection of being informed or entertained."""
5,One good CD,You must get this CD! you don't know what you are missing out on! Buy it now plus it's a great deal here!
1,IRA Haandbook a must buy for every simple non achiever,"What a brilliant load of [...], don't buy it beter off throwing your money in the sea, if you don't live near the sea then a river or large stream will do, if you don't live beside either of these then perhaps you should buy it [...]."
3,Sleeker Design but still buggy,I upgraded from Money 2001 because it was giving me error problems. The program would close down and sometimes give me the dreaded blue screen. This only happened after upgrading to WinXP.SoI decided to get MS Money 2004. I really only track expenses and reconcile my accounts and use a few reports. All I can it has a sleeker design and less problematic than the 2001 version. Since getting it in July its shut down at least a dozen times. So be warned. Ive read that the more current versions arent all that stable either.
5,Excellent,"Very happy. Received very quickly. Kept up to date on progress via email. Product exactly as advertised, at a good price."
1,"Ability to import online statements -- lies, lies, lies!!!","One of the real values of these products is to import or autmatically update your transaction history for various accounts. There is more support for Quicken than MS-Money. Even though MS-Money claims these can be converted, it isn't by any means consistant. Wanna buy my MS-Money version, I switching back to Quicken?!"
1,Confusing,"I recieved this product with my new dell computer and have been trying to figure it out for the past 3 weeks! I was hoping it would be somewhat easy to use, but no luck! I am now going to buy quicken 2004 because this product is in my opinion poorly built. I am not a computer saavy person, so hopefully quciken will not be as confusing."
1,The worst software I ever saw...,Microsoft Money has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience...Please tell Microsoft about this problem...I just received the product this afternoon. I install it and even restart my PC many times. It still cannot ever start... Really disappointed. DO NO BUY THIS PRODUCT!
4,Collecting Bossons,Wonderful reference guide for any begining or advanced collector - a MUST HAVE! all full color pictures and the background info on all the pieces made through 1982 - A second book was published - but not currently available on Amazon -
1,Won't even turn on,"I can't tell you how this product performs, because I can't even get it to power up. When I plug it in, I get no response from the unit whatsoever. I initially thought it was a power cord issue, but I tried two other cords I had and neither worked. I am extremely disappointed. I ordered the Jwin Electronics I552BLK to replace it."
1,Buyer Beware: POSSIBLE FIRE HAZARD,I recently purchased this stereo and was very disappointed. When I plugged it in for the very first time smoke started coming out of the back of the stereo. I quickly unplugged the stereo and returned it.
1,Mine broke and there's only a 90 day warranty,"This product was okay when it arrived - we wanted a battery operated device to take to the pool / beach. The sound quality was average, as was the build quality. Anyway it died a couple of months after I bought it (despite pool / beach use we'd been extra careful with it) and by the time I'd got around to checking the warranty I realized it had expired. Even if it hadn't the documentation was so poor I wouldn't have known how to get the unit fixed! Steer clear."
1,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Well after reading the first two reviews, I purchased these 2-way radios at Best Buy. I tested them out after getting home and found I lost contact around 1/2 mile!! Yes it says UP TO 10 miles under optimum / perfect conditions, so you figure under not so perfect condition, at least get 5 miles or so. My 1/2 mile was in your typical town / suburb type setting. Both people testing this radio was outside too. Some houses, trees..etc around. Nothing of any major concern for interuption.I figured ok, well at least give me a few miles, but NO! 1/2 mile was my maximum distance. The weather was clear, calm and cool, and I had fresh new batteries.I will be returning these in the morning!"
4,Nice Radios,"I compared a number of brands simultaneously and chose to keep these. I was never in the open flat environment for maximum range,still I got 6.5 miles on one test with reasonable clarity. They outperformed all the others (Cobra,Uniden,Motorola)with regard to range and clarity. Nice display too.Two complaints: 1)The battery meter is USELESS. The low battery indicator comes on at about the same time the unit dies. 2)It does not keep the settings of channel/subcode and power setting, if the battery dies, or are changed.You cannot see the approx. battery strength as with the Motorola. Keep spare AA batteries on hand, or charge every night. Still Great sound. I thought better clarity than Motorla and Cobra. Uniden was also a nice radio, as 2nd choice!"
1,Vibrate Alert,"The first thing I did when I took the radios out of the box was to insert them into the charger. Charge them for 12 hours for the first time the instructions said. So then I left and went to work. When I came back, one of the radios was ON Vibrate Alert mode. The radio was turned off and sitting in the charging pod. It got even louder when I took it out of the charger and it would not stop till I finally took out the battery. These walkie-talkies are junk. Lousy range too."
5,"""Destroyer"" might be a little strong...how about ""defacer""","This thing is simple...plug it in, turn it on and send a cd through the slot. It comes out the other side with dents/scratches all over it.I was hoping it would DESTROY them...I wanted little pieces of flaming plastic falling out. Heh.Works well, I leave it out in the Copy Center for any/all people to use and everybody seems satisfied."
5,"Anyone concerned about their privacy, should own one of these.","NRZDD3001 Data Destroyer, CD/DVD Data Shredder, Processes up to 15 Disks/MinuteI purchased this item on 3/8/2008 & received it on 3/12/2008. It's everything it's advertised to be. It waffels both sides of the DVD or CD destroying the data & rendering them unreadable. It's relatively quiet & compact, taking up little room on a desk. It's simple to use & the fact that it doesn't actually shred the CD/DVD's causing a mess, is a plus. No more protective eyewear & work gloves. Also, the price is right. I highly recommend this product."
5,Great Cd Destroyer,"I was looking for a CD shredder, but reviews for the inexpensive all indicated problems. Reviews for this CD destroyer (not a shredder) were all very good so I bought it. I very pleased with its ease of use -- just slide the CD in the slot and out it comes with multiple indentations. Occasionally, there is a loud crunch, but this did not inhibit the destroyer from working. I ran through about 50 CDs in a short period of time. I recommend this item."
5,Works great!,This machine works exactly as described. It makes a cd unreadable by imprinting it with hundreds of tiny divots and it does it very quickly--feed it into the front and it drops out the back ready to throw away. It has a small footprint so fits nicely on a desktop and it has enough weight to keep it from moving while doing its thing.
5,This is a very helpful reference book,"I couldn't tell you how many times I have had to look up a term I didn't know and it wasn't in Webster's dictionary. Anyone in the mediacl field-Respiratory therapists, Physical Therapists, occupational therapists, nurses, Radiology technicians will find this book to be very valuable. It is written as clearly and simply as possible. Of course, everyone's favorite part is all the color photos and diagrams. It was worth every penny. This book would be great for any allied health students or graduates. It makes reading those difficult textbooks mcuh easier."
5,complete with pictures,"Mosby's dictionary far exceeded my expectations for medical knowledge. Its pictures, charts, tables, and lab data are incredibly useful in getting better understanding of the diseases, conditions, procedures, and body structures that you are researching. Mosby's is not for the faint of heart, the numerous photographs, diagrams, and pictures are very graphic especially with some of the congenital anomalies and skin disorders. A lot of nurses that I went to school with (and I agree) feel that this was the better choice of reference because it prepares you for what you may encounter and many of us are visual learners (we have to see to understand). I really like how informative the definitions are and have found there are more listings here then in other dictionaries such as Tabors. We keep a reference Mosby on my floor and I also have one saved in my personal office. Its a valuable tool for anyone entering the medical profession or interested in anatomy or health."
1,"Mosby's Medical ,Nursing, & Allied Health Dictionary 5th Ed.","My wife bought this book at Waterstone's in England, 5 March 2001. She was using it for her Medical Transcription home study course.The book was reliable until Thursday 29. She wanted to look up 'suture', but unbeknown to us pages 1531 to 1594 were missing.Therefore we have a useless book."
4,Belive Me... It's Good!!!,"Bueno... En español es mejor para mi... El disco esta bueno... no es excepcional, pero es bueno. Realmente lo recomiendo a aquellas personas que añoran los 60'...

2,unit did not work,was not able to try it out since we cannot get it to turn on. We are requesting a return/replacement.
1,An embarrassment to the engineers who designed this.,This is one of the worst examples of design and quality that I have ever encountered in an electronic device..
1,Piece of crap,"Very Very hard to set up. Myself, husband or teenage computer nerd had hard time figuring out. When finally got it then the alarm was not reliable. One time late for work was all it took. Sent it back."
4,This is an excellent cd with many different good tracks!,"When I first heard of Dovetail Joint I didn't know who they were. The first song I heard by them was ""Level on the Inside"" and I really liked it. I bought the cd and I loved it. Every track on this cd is good. I think that Dovetail Joint is a great up and coming band"
3,VERY USEFUL!,VERY USEFUL! ESPECIALLY TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T USE ENGLISH IN MOTHER LANGUAGE VERY HELPFUL TO SPOKEN ENGLISH.
2,No. Just no.,"I ordered one for every movie and the other three, from other sellers were fantastic; this one on the other hand was bent to hell and had to sit under a flat surface for a day just to be ""sort of okay."" I put it up for now, but I'll definitely be replacing it ASAP."
4,A piece of Hardcore history...,"Anyone who has followed Hardcore music from 1995 onwards knows that the end of 1999 was considered the ""death"" of Hardcore, and didn't pop back up until 2001/2002. If you are expecting the bouncy, sing-a-long style, this is not for you. The 3 mixes blast you with the ""full on"" trancey style, with an occosial ""happy hardcore"" track threw in. And the speed limit is down in this volume, except for Sy's mix, his mix is in the 170 bpm range, but many of the tracks just have that lacking feeling. It gets 4 stars only because it is a piece of Hardcore history, you can pretty much hear what caused the retreat of Hardcore music on these 3 discs."
5,The Mary-ist!!,"It is great that Mary released a collection of Christmas standards. If you've never heard her then you have the perfect reason to buy this CD. Her smooth voice glides effortlessly around these great seasonal picks. Ever heard the song Plastic Star? Me either, but its so damn catchy I can't get it out of my head. Santa Baby is sexy and the Christmas Waltz is the snappiest! This is the album you always wished you had for the holidays. Great background music to spike the egg nog and decorate your aluminum Christmas tree with."
5,Golf for Old Golf Pro's,Great book!!! Lots of helpful ideas for staying flexable to keep the full turn working. I highly recommend it.
5,Puts forth a powerful way for peering into the future.,"This impressive work shows how to harness imagination and strategic management techniques to create scenarios that simulate future opportunities and threats. Shows how to use scenario building, drawing on case studies and insights of 26 expert scenario developers. Presents a new system of scenario learning, bringing together strategic management, scenario technology, teamwork, creativity, and decision-making skills. This is a meaty and informative book."
3,Not as good as his other books,"This book describes the sitting qigong exercises, but it doesn't provide good explanations why you should be doing them and it doesn't describe benefits of each exercise.I found it boring and not very useful. The only thing that I liked is that he gave a good detailed explanation of opening and closing sequence you should do before and after every qigong practice."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this product based on the two reviews listed. I guess we all have different expectations of what quality sound is. Virtually no bass and at times gets tinny. I bought it for my wife for Valentine's Day to replace her older Phillips CD boom box in the bathroom. The sound does not compare. The old Phillips sounds much better. If you buy this expecting ""big sound"" out of a small package, you will be disappointed. If you just want something to hook your iPod up to, it works."
1,GOT A LEMON!,The Emerson i-tone that was shipped to us through Amazon was defective. When we plugged in the A/C adapter it hummed and buzzed and sounded like the end of the AM radio dial.
3,Huh?? WHAT??,Noah's Arkestra is the song from ESPN NBA playoff commercials this year (2006). haven't heard anythig else from the album but that song is hot. So there you go.
1,No case or packaging,The CD came without the jewelcase or CD pacakging/artwork. This was NOT indicated in the product description and I do not consider this satisfactory.
3,"Could work IF your pregnant with your first, not working.","Great philosophy, made perfect sense and was easy to read and understand. Be prepared for lots of diaper changes and lots of committment and time. This would work great if you purchase this book while pregnant, with your first child and not planning on working. Otherwise I wonder how practical or do-able this would be with a second or third child in addition to housework, cooking, errands, etc.? It seems as though the authors child was ""the chosen one"", never was it mentioned that he fussed or refused to go potty even once. I was disappointed that the book didn't say ""purchase while pregnant"" on the cover. I purchased this with the intent of using this on my third child, however she's already 11 months old and I feel that, given her age, this book doesn't really apply."
5,Wow!,"I ordered this on the advise of a friend. What a relaxing CD. If you are looking for something that you can sit back in your recliner and forget about your troubles or something relaxing to drive to, don't pass up this CD."
4,Great CD!,"I really love this cd. I use it for Massage, and all my clients love it. I would have given it a 5-star; but the last cut, bansuri hits a few notes that are not quite as restful as the others.All in all, I really enjoy listening to this. And, if you like this cd, (It's my first Shastro cd) I really recommend Above the Clouds by Kavin Hoo. Just read the reviews & you'll see why. : ) But I do look forward to hearing more Shastro. Very Lovely~*"
3,"Mellow, relaxing","This is good music for relaxation, doing Tai Chi or Yoga, etc.It turned out to be less exotic than I thought from listening to the excerpts. I am undecided on buying more by this artist."
1,Not Happy,"I was a loyal buyer of the verve remix series, but it seems that after buying volumes 1,2, and 3 separately, I must now buy them all again as a box set in order to get the ""bonus disc?""Or will this bonus disc ever be available by itself?"
3,A good package,"As the name suggested, this complete version consists of the Verve remixed series:- 1, 2 and 3. In addition, there is one extra disc featuring remixes and enhanced materials not found elsewhere (exclusively for this package). These 3 disc consist of good dance music (ambient, house, techno, trance, trip, just to name a few). Give it a few spins and you will find yourself glue to it. I can't help wondering if Verve Records is still coming out with new CDs in this series. Last but not the least, I think that this is a 'value for money' package and for those of you who like good dance remixes should not miss this edition."
4,Review of Bryce's 'Life and Society',"This is an extensive consideration of different social aspects of Hittite society. It covers every basic niche--political leadership, merchants, farmers, priests, marriage, slavery, etc. There is also a very interesting essay at the end that looks at the relationship between Greece and the Near East, and consider the Homeric cycle as an orientalized work. Endnote aren't very helpful, and Bryce occasionally used phrases that annoy me. ""More or less, by and large, greater or lesser, etc.""--pick one and stop waffling about your position. Never mind me; this is a great book."
1,Its door stuck after a few use,"I got this drive from Staples few monthes ago. Burned several DVDs, success and failure mixed, not sure why. Anyways, one morning, the door failed to open, tried reboot pc, did not work. Used pinhole to open it, it refuse to open after the pc is powered on. I am contacting the tech support about this product, hopefully I can get a replacement. Worse come to worse, I can have a paperclip standby to help me open this thing up. What a doll."
3,Not at good as single,"I've been using the single pie iron for years.I like putting in a piece of bread larger than the actual form of the pie iron. That way it crimps the bread together and nothing oozes (highly sophisticated term) in to the pie iron and makes a mess. Secondly when you eat it less ends up on your shirt.This double one sounds like a great idea but doesn't allow for the crimp. I highly recommend just buying two singles and you will have to wash less shirts and less maintenance on the pie iron.note: Marshmallows, chocolate and bread may sound good but doesn't work. My marshmallows just disappeared into the bread and I was left with lumpy Hersheys (not what it use to be). :)For best results buy bread with large slices (not necessarily think but wide and tall for the crimp)."
4,Lots of fun and versatile,"We have used this pie iron to make grilled ham and cheese sandwiches, fruit pies with bread, sausage links, and french toast. It has recipes for so many different foods that we know we can have fun learning to make new things. Like any pie iron it takes awhile to make enough food for a group of people, but it is easy and fun."
3,"Mega Heavy, Mediocre Construction","My wife got to use a single sandwich pie-iron and thought she'd one-up that one with a double... Well, It does the trick, but is quite heavy. If you have something to rest it on within the fire, it will do the trick. Our handle on one of the sides separated after the first use which makes this a bit challenging to manage. I'm certain it is easy enough to fix if the pin that is supposed to hold it in place comes out, however it is disappointing to have to deal with something poorly put together after the first use. All-in-all, the sandwiches tasted great and my forearms got a good workout but the construction could have been quality checked a bit better."
5,Cool new toy!,"Bought this for my fiance and we used it on the firepit last night - what fun! We made a ""dessert panini"" I suppose you could call it - ciabatta bread, nutella, and strawberry preserves - mmm!It cooked really fast...faster than we thought (the first round burned). When we tried again we gave it maybe 2 minutes on either side in the hottest part of the fire and it was perfect. We have yet to try other kinds of sandwiches or eggs, and it seems like the possibilities are endless."
3,Too Heavy - Buy two singles instead,"Although it works great and I always prefer cast iron over the cheaper plain metal pie irons I failed to consider the weight of cast iron if you are holding it or re-positioning it over an open camp fire.Also, sometimes the sandwiches overlap and stick together at the edge, even with normal white bread.If you can get beyond the weight of the cast iron pie iron the quality itself is really nice. Make very excellent tasting campfire food. Locked well into place and comes apart into two different pieces to clean."
5,Great Pie Iron!,"Great big pie Iron for cooking sandwiches/etc. in. Always a hit around the campfire.Very robust unit. Cast iron head, chrome steel handles with wood grips on the end.Was just thrown in a box with a strip of paper package stuffing (doing nothing) but since this thing is so robust, it arrived safe and sound."
1,Rome cast iron products,"I'm very disappointed that the Rome products are made in China especially, since it states it's made in USA. Just because items are assembled in USA doesn't mean it's made in USA. Please correct this and not mislead people like it mislead us."
4,helpful,"I bought this book for a non-American friend to help answer all those questions about tipping in this country. When I glanced through it, there seemed to be adequate information in most areas of tipping. I think he finds it useful."
3,Robbert Smit Animation Director,I bought this dvd because the cover art is by Australian Cartoonist Frantz Kantor. The other reason was to see how much good work on a piss poor budget that Robbert Smit and his fellow Aussie animators could squeeze out. They did a nice job. It is a bit stiff byt when you are on a low budget they pulled it off.
5,Excellent Children's Book,This is a very entertaining and fun book to read aloud to a class or even one child. It is fast paced and interactive and I simply love it.
4,Hip-hop fun for all ages,This book is fantastic for young and old alike. Two year olds love the imaginitive pictures and the rhythmic text. Eight year olds love to see familiar fairy tale characters in a new light. Adults enjoy reading the fun lyrics. It's a great Halloween tale for the whole family.
2,It was OK...,"I purchased this book based on the reviews, which I normally find very helpful especially when most readers all feel strongly about a book. I don't know if it was just the mood we were in or our taste is just different on this one, but nobody in our family thought it was very good (me, my husband, our 4 year old, an uncle, a cousin...) and it just failed to capture us. My child loves Halloween and books, and she had us read it once and NEVER asked for it again.I know almost all the other reviews are really positive, but we just didn't feel the same way."
5,Good mats and a solid price,Sil pats that do everything that is asked. Great for cookies and other baked treats. Usually these are a get what you pay for item but even at a reasonable price they deliver.
2,"Not Made in France, but in China","Sadly Amazon chose not to be forward about where this product was manufactured. Had I known that it was made in China I never would have purchased it either. There is a reason that a law is being contemplated that will require the statement of the country of origin. I wish Amazon would do this voluntarily. :(I cannot recommend this item, as I would not allow anything in the kitchen that was made in China at the moment. There are too many news stories of products being toxic, poisonous and downright deadly. Hopefully, when China cleans up their act and the corruption within the state. Maybe then."
3,"Be sure they don't send Priority Mail, unless you would like.","These mats are the bomb!! My husband and I use them all the time. The company that sends them is also helpful. Just be sure they don't send your order Priority Mail, unless you want. Otherwise your postage will be more than is originally calculated. They DID Correct with us, when contacted. You will enjoy."
5,Good as expensive brands.,These mats are just as good as the expensive brands. Save your money and buy these. They really work well.
4,World Cuisine Baking Mat,"I really love these baking mats. They fit right down in my cookie sheets and baking a homemade pizza was no problem. I usually have to use parchment paper, but this will cut down on buying that item.I also used these mats for my annual chocolate dipping. Instead of wax paper, I lined cookie sheets with the mats and put my hand dipped chocolates there to harden. When I popped them off, they had a neat ""checkerboard"" design on the bottoms from the mat.Drawbacks: I'm not crazy about the black border around the edge. Also, when I cut through a hard piece of crust, the pizza cutter scored the baking mat a little. This doesn't affect the usage of the mat, but it's advertised as ""can't be cut."" What they really mean is the woven fiberglass inside can't be cut, the silicon, however, is vulnerable..."
5,"Great product, Better price",I have used the silpat brand and this baking mat works just as well at a fraction of the price. I bought 4 and may order more. They make cleanup a breeze and work better then parchment.
2,silicone cookie mat,The product was not expensive and works all right though it is made in China and there were a few spots unevenly coated. The other one I have is a Silpat made in France and much better made.
5,Nice looking and blows well,What does anyone expect from a bellows but appearance and functionality. This one has both and seems durable enough to last a couple decades.
1,Was unable to view it!,"I was excided when I received it, I first saw it as a boy in the early 1960's. But when I tried to play the DVD, the message appeared that I waas in the wrong region to view it. I wrote the company it came from, but was told that it Was not Reason enough to return it. So I am stuck with it. I had reviewed it before, but is not there. I tried to talk with Amazon, but was told it was between me and seller, though I bought it on the Amazon site. Everything else I've bought from Amazon.com has been Great."
4,Really authentic dramaziation of the pacific war,"The only thing that prevented me from giving this movie a 5 starwas the occasional schmalsty, goffy comments made in jest duringthe film. But I beleive this was common in pictures made duringthe war in the 40's."
2,Outdated,"I bought this video for my husband who is an avid war movie fan. I sat down to watch it with him. He and I felt that it took a long time to see any war action. It was an okay movie, but it is very outdated by today's standards. For the life of me, I cannot imagine any soldiers of today - talking as sweet and corny and singing like these actors do. It's a nice war movie for the year 1943 - when I suppose everything was sugar coated."
3,Unique Perspective of Famous Battle Filmed During the War,"Historical fact was less important in making this film than motivation for a nation desperate for victories. In 1943 shortly after the Marine victory on Guadalcanal when this film was rushed out, the outcome of the war was still very much in doubt. This film is extremely interesting considering that it is mostly propaganda, less so from historical perspective. But if you're interested in the battle, the Marine Corps, or life in America during the war, this movie should be seen."
3,"An enjoyable movie, but short on the brutalities of the conflict","I rated Guadalcanal Diary Okay because I enjoyed it. However, it was not altogether realistic even though it was enjoyable. It was probably made as a wartime propaganda film, and had some good scenes. It was good at depicting men aboard ship and hitting the beach. It was not as good at depicting the real horrors of war. It was not as good at depicting the Japanes landing of fresh troops almost every night on the northeern end of Guadalcanal, nor in depicting the really brutal naval battles in Iron bottom Sound, nor at depicting the Japanes determination to hold the island, and the many banzei charges they made."
4,Decent war movie,Saw part of this movie on TV so I wanted to add this movie to my movie collection. Lots of war action as well as many stars at the beginning of their careers.
2,Cheaply Made,"I ordered this product with high hopes. It's cheaply made. I was not impressed with the mechanics of this item. To engage the record player you have to unhook the ""arm"" manually and then move all the way to the right to turn it on. To turn off, you have to be careful and pick the needle up off the record and pull the ""arm"" all the way to the left until you hear a click. The CD player opened just fine when the open/close button was pushed, but would not close until you pushed the slider. Sound quality was pretty good. It wouldn't take much to break any part of this record player. If you are looking for something that will last I don't believe this will be the record player for you."
2,Una cursa muy mal,"This course is the worst in the world! the speakers on the the tapes don't sound the least bit native and the way the words are spoken is not natural, at all. It does present a good amount of vocabulary. The course seems to assume that the reader has a basic understanding of Spanish,as well, making it not completely for beginers. I highly suggest that anyone planning to purchase a Spanish speaking program spend more money on a better program, of which there are many."
1,Broken on arrival,Don't by these from Amazon. They are not pack for shipping and arrive broken. Go to a store and pick them up. It is worth the time and money.
1,Doesn't work. Leaks like crazy.,"This hose reel seems to have a bad design. The mount where the water supply hooks up leaks. It has a sliding mechanism the seems to lock when there is no water pressure, but the minute any water is running, it just leaks out the bottom. All the parts are plastic, which seems to be the norm for low end reels.Stay away from this one."
1,"I bought 3, my mistake","I liked that it kept the hose out of sight and protected it. On all 3, the outer connection pulled out, thus rendering it useless. I purchased them at Target a couple of years ago, but for the price point they are a huge rip off. I agree w/ the other reviewers, save your money."
1,Junk,"What a piece of junk,leaked like crazy,right out of the box.Took it apart and applied Teflon tape where hose joins inner reel,lasted until the tape wore out,one season."
1,Utter Garbage,"The PTK200D is rated for 225 feet of hose, but by the time only 100 feet were wound on it the reel began slipping and jamming. The handle was so flimsy it felt ready to snap off and the ""guide"" that was supposed to glide back and forth and evenly wind the hose onto the reel made one pass and then stalled in place and wound the hose entirely around the right end of the reel. Useless."
4,Suncast Hose Reel Tracker PTK200d,Item was not packaged very good. Only a card board box. Item was not damaged and works as I expected.
4,Veranda plant stand,Delivery took longer than expected and I had no notice from vendor of the delay. Very satisfied with the product once it arrived.
4,A Star In Her Own Right,"I saw St. Etienne at the Fillmore in San Francisco recently and all eyes in the auditorium were on Sarah. She is probably the best kept secret in pop, mixing a lot of what was great with the golden age of britpop chanteuses from the 1960's, like Petula Clark and Marianne Faithfull. I'm sure you have all heard the comparisons. On stage, there's no doubt that Sarah has a lot of star and sex appeal. One flash of that coy smile and shy downard look and you're hooked. After hearing her bubbly EP ""Kelly's Locker,"" I'm sure her popularity as a solo artist will grow. Try listening to the opening track ""Judy Don't You Worry"" in a quiet place with only candles illuminating the room. Songs like ""Taxi"" and the remix of ""Anymore"" are genuinely upbeat and may be destined for a European dance floor or ""Britpop Day"" at a club near you. Don't be afraid with the EP lable, either. Unlike Etienne's disappointing EP ""Places to Visit,"" this one is a gem..."
3,A few very good songs,"The two actual new tracks here ""Judy, Don't You Worry"", and ""Sea Shells"" are both very good. If, like me, you don't already have the excellent ""Taking Off For France"" on an import version of ""Lipslide"", then this track alone is worth the price of this EP. This song reminds me a lot of ""Like a Moterway"", one of my favorites by Saint Etienne. I also like ""Taxi"" and ""Penthouse Girl ,Basement Boy"", both of which are also fairly fast paced songs. I don't much care for ""How Far"", finding my self asking ""How Long?"" (will this song keep going). I usually skip it. As for the remixes, I find the Armchair Mix of ""Home"" to be interesting yet unnecessary, and Nino's Liquid Steel Mix of ""Anymore"" to be a bit tedious. All in all however, a worthwhile purchase, and a definite must buy for fans of Saint Etienne."
3,Nice Gentle Pop,Great picture on the CD Cover!I haven't got around to purchasing Cracknell's Lipslide since I got all the songs from Napster and the CD is pretty costly. However at 10 bucks Kelly's Locker was a must have. I enjoy 'Home' and 'Taxi' in particular. This is a nice collection of pop with a slightly retro 60's tinge. Very sweet. Very nice.
2,Poor action,"Heh. Me expected something better. Film pretend on serious thoughts and action, but reality is a different: non-charizmatic hero, slow, non-involving action, dumb story and stupid pigeons."
1,Bad dog!,"What a terrible terrible movie. Nothing like watching an overweight ""samurai"" eat ice cream and fight old timers. This was the worst movie I have seen in a long time..."
1,GHOST DOG THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI,"I feel really bad for me because I purchased this video. This was by far the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I practically had to fast forward through the parts that meant nothing.Usually forest whitiker acts very well but in this movie went straight from my dvd player into the trash. Stupid plot,no action,horible actors= terrible movie.I guess this is why the movie went straight to video.Warning: this movie was terrible"
1,"Bad, doesn't begin to cover it","I wonder how to say crap in Japanese? Another way to say it in English is Ghost Dog. This movie makes one wonder why it's supposedly so hard to break into the movie business. If this is the best that people can spend their money on then they have too much of it and deserve to lose it. You will be stupider and less of a person for watching this film. Save yourself and your IQ. ""Howard the Duck"" is intellectual compared to this crap. You've been warned"
1,A Waste of Time and Talent,I wasted 30 minutes of my time watching this movie. A waste of talent using Forest Whitacker. Useless plot. Don't bother.
4,Quirky but entertaining,"This may be the most unique movie that I've seen in the last decade or more. Very philosophical, yet violent, and funny. It's not perfect but I give it credit for being very unique."
4,this film made me think..,"in the tradition of the best art this film made me think and I really enjoyed the experience. the areas that it took me included:the beauty of readingjapanese culture and traditionliving life in a disciplined wayliving according to one's own codeI found the film, well acted, scripted and photograghed. There were a couple of minutes during the start of the film when Ghost Dog is driving through the city where I got a bit restless, but this is the extent of my complaints. The violent scenes are fun and interesting , the end is neither tragic or unhappy - I found this an uplifting movie - well done Jim!"
5,Simply incredible,"I have to say that I'm a fan of Jim Jarmusch, but I always approach his films with trepidation. I'm always pleasantly surprised.You can read about the plot in the reviews above. What impressed me was the superb cinematography and story of this film. Jarmusch is a master of characterization. Many directors will resort to certain tactics to keep the audience distant from the characters, but Jarmusch likes to hang on for a slightly uncomfortable amount of time, just to give you that little extra glimpse into their lives.Do not hesitate to see this film. It's classic Jarmusch, classic Whitaker, classic Bankole. And the sountrack is kicking."
4,Ghost Dog with Forest Whitaker,"This is a very good film. The uniqueness of Whitaker's real-life persona enhances the unique character he brings to the screen. Ghost Dog displays all the discipline of a martial arts master but with a gun in hand. From this perspective he is far removed from the on-screen likes of Bruce Lee, Jim Kelly and Jet Li but equally as deadly. The film does not hide the fact the methods of destruction used by Ghost Dog are not only outlandish but straight out of a cartoon fantasy. This adds to its entertainment value: we know we're being taken for a ride. It's a fun trip. Whitaker's supporting cast round out this excellent ensemble work."
5,Sad and poetic film by Jim Jarmusch...,"When my Dad told me about this movie I was quicky interested. I think that Forest Whitaker is one of the great actors of our time. I had never seen a Jim Jarmusch movie befor Ghost Dog and after seeing it I am a Jim Jarmusch fan. This is a very dark movie about a quiet man who studies the way of the samurai very seriously. He is also involved with the Italian mob. When his boss tells him that one of his fellow mob bosses is out to get him, Ghost Dog decides that he must kill or be killed. With a beautiful hip-hop soundtrack from the Wu-Tang's RZA this is a hauntingly poetic mnasterpiece by American film master Jim Jarmusch. A must for every fan of indie film."
3,Split personality,"Is it an action movie, a comedy, or an art house entry. Good actors with a script that can't decide which way to go. Interesting try, but not a winner. (And why the last scene in the street?)"
4,Ghost dog is very original.,Ghost dog is a fun movie to watch. Some people completely miss the point of the movie. It's not supposed to be completely serious. It is part comedy and part drama. Forrest Whitaker gives an excellent performance. Highly recommended.
2,Huh...?,"I really wanted to like this movie. I really did.Forest Whitaker plays an urban Mob assassin who lives his life by the code of the Samurai. When a hit gets witnessd by the Don's Daughter, he becomes a liability, and is targeted for termination. Director Jim Jarmusch seems to be an acquired taste, and I guess I ain't acquired it. The movie is WAAAY too long, and the meager plot is padded mercilessly by rapping Mobsters, French-speaking Ice-Cream vendors, a cute kid, a shouting old man, clothing thefts, etc. The movie takes avant-garde to a whole new level, and while there were parts that I enjoyed, it was just a little too weird for me to recommend."
2,It tries to be too many things,Pros:Interesting philosophies/books introuced throughout the movieThe french guy who sold ice creamCons:Too silly at timesThe old gangstersThe ending being so stupid makes the whole movie pointlessEverybody watching cartoonsSummary:Dont watch this movie unless you are extremely bored and want to see a movie that tries to be so serious and silly at various times with a horrible ending.
4,Not what I expected,"When I saw a preview for this movie in the theatres, I literally laughed at it. It seemed so silly: Forest Whitaker as a samurai? But afterwards, I read some reviews for it here at Amazon.com and decided to pick it up on a lark. I was pleasantly suprised to discover my 15 dollars hadn't been wasted. Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai sucessfully mixes Eastern philosophy and hip-hop culture, art, (some) comedy and action (although it wouldn't at all be fair to call this an action movie), and some good dialouge as well as excellent acting all around. My only problem with the movie, which kept it from getting 5 stars was some overly silly and/or confusing scenes. But overall, its a very good movie I'd recommend to anyone whos looking for an un-Hollywood movie."
1,dont waste your life,"This film, was by far, the worst way I could have spent 2 hours of my life. It would have been more productive to bore a hole in my arm, or watch a spider sleep. This man, who for most of the film you watch walk aimlessly around the streets, is in no way a samurai. There is little plot, and what exists is sketchy at best. At numberous points in the film I actually screamed for something to happen, perhaps for some character to develop, or for a line to be said.I only award this film one star because the site will not allow a rating of zero. Life is a precious gift, too good to be wasted on this film."
1,"I understand what they are doing, but...","... this movie is a really terrible way to go about doing it. I mean, it is almost painful to watch. Aside from a few truly excellent lines, it is a total waste. The pacing is slow, detracting from the meaning by numbing the mind. The acting is, Whitaker included, terrible. The French-English thing is overdone and tiresome. Absolutely nothing is realistic. And the swishing sound effect that accompanies Whitaker's movements is REALLY annoying.I would rather watch a marathon of the Look Who's Talking flicks than see this dog again. Woof."
1,MST3K Bound,"Trying to find deep meaning and sybolism in this movie is about as meaningless as edible toilet paper. The 'mafia'in this movie would be better suite at taking insight and direction from porn movies. The acting, editing, story, plot, and mood of this movie has got to be some of the worst ever put on film. I'm not saying it takes a big budget and highly skilled acters to make a movie. Just some people that might have taken an acting class or even perhaps looked the word up in a dictionary. This movie is good for only two things. Having the boys over for some drinks and having an MST3K party, or for a how not to make a movie. There were to many times the director tried to convey a message to his audience. What that message was stopped with the director. And how can someones highly acclaimed film debut consist of a sentence? You would be better off renting this first and using the money you save to go and get plastered so you could forget this horrible, horrible film."
1,Big yawn!,"I fell asleep during this movie and didn't bother to try to finish it. The story was incredibly slow and boring. Forest Whitaker's performance as a samurai is laughable. He just looks rediculous through the entire film. The mobsters in the movie are just corny Italian stereotypes. This movie was a waste of space on my Netflix queue. But on the bright side, RZA did the soundtrack and that may be worth checking that out."
1,GHost movie....,"Boring. Endless. Moralless. There's absolute nothing attractive about Whitaker's character. He's as bad as the Mafia guys he's hired to kill... Absurd!Ok, it's different, it's an ""independent"" movie, but nonetheless is bad!"
4,A movie that really makes you think.,"When I rented this movie, I really didn't know what I was in for. All I had seen was the preview, but that was enough to convince me. The unique plot keeps you there, even if it is somewhat slow. The entire movie is unique and artistic; one that really makes you think. Forest Whittaker plays his role very well, and the rest of the cast is good as well. (I enjoyed his two friends, the Haitian and the child.) The jokes, if somewhat subtle, are humorous, and the assasination scenes are well done. This is a very good movie for anyone who is interested in a ""true"" samurai movie, so rent it as soon as you can, and if you like it, buy it as well."
4,Cool.,This is a surreal action movie laced with eastern philisophy and Japanese literature. Ghost Dog is a mafia hitman who subscribes to the way of the samurai. After one hit goes bad his employers try to rub him out. Big mistake the carnage begins as he hunts them down one by one. The visuals in this are amazing especially the scene where he enters the country hideout.
4,"An ""artsy"" type of movie","This is one of the movies you watch when you're trying to really appreciate the art of making a movie, and acting. It's not the typical movie that pulls in megabucks today, and I see why it didn't make it in the theatres that long. It lacks the hustle and bustle of typical action/drama movies, and in comparison to some recent releases, it's ""quiet."" I would not have wanted to watch this type of movie in a theatre either. Don't get me wrong, it is good and Forest Whitaker's acting is great, but...it's different. It's the type of movie I prefer to watch at home while I savor a cup of hot tea or something.The movie starts a little slow, but I enjoyed the soundtrack, the visuals, and the humor. My recommendation, rent it before you buy it buy it. If you like it after you rent it, then by all means, add it to your collection."
2,this movie tries too hard,"This movie tries too hard, it straddles the line between being too much of a cliche and overdoing the effort to be unique. The Italian characters were more detrimental than positive with their attempts at humor and bumbling incompetence. Also, the movie tries to take on too many roles at the same time--a black man who listens to hip-hop, reads a lot, studies the way of the Samurai, employed by the mafia, befriends a little girl and a French-speaking ice cream salesman, and lives on the roof of an apartment building beside a pigeon coop. A lot of potential but I think all those different elements pull the movie in too many directions at the same time. If you want to see a beautifully done movie of this genre, see ""The Professional."""
2,urban loneliness remake,"When I watched Ghost Dog some time ago, I was confused but also very embarassed as I thought obviously either the protagonist or the writer didn't understand anything about the Way of the Samurai. But having seen Melville's film Le Samourai, I can now explain Ghost Dog. Le Samourai is a non-sequitur in which the title of the film has essentially nothing to do with the plot (assassination) or theme (solitude) of the film. Ghost Dog is an homage re-make of Le Samourai that says ""let's try to make the title relate to the plot."" It's that simple, and that's why the film fails. The idea of a overweight, out of shape inner-city contract killer who derives some lifestyle from reading Hagakure and swinging around a samurai sword is ridiculous and not even clever or fun if you actually know anything about Japanese history, martial arts culture, or, especially, the actual contents of Hagakure. Like Le Samourai, Ghost Dog depends entirely on fashion and film history for any success."
2,Wanted to Like It......,"Is this a great movie?.... No. Is this a horrible movie?.... No, but close. I really wanted to like this movie going in, but it didn't deliver for me. I was expecting a fairly offbeat cult movie similar to Dead Man with J. Depp or Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East and something where I could watch it over and over and pick up something new. I couldn't bare to watch this movie more than once. I did like the music in Ghost Dog but am hard pressed to find any scene in the movie that I really liked. If it wasn't for Whittaker this movie would never get off the ground. Of course your mileage may vary since a majority of reviewers did like it... Go figure!"
1,Slooowwwww.,"The cover for this video has quotes from newspaper/magazine reviews saying how 'funny' and 'fresh' this film is. Don't believe it, it is so slow. Some scenes just drag on for ages and the whole film is really in slow motion. I'm afraid I could find nothing entertaining here. Where was the humour?. It's one of those films that critics/die-hard movie enthusiasts love, but the general public find boring. The film also has no visual appeal at all. I don't want to watch a film to be depressed, I want to watch a film that is uplifting. Forrest Whitaker has a glum expression nearly all the way through. God save us from arty film makers and character studies (especially when the character is boring)!"
3,"Good, could have been great","I liked this movie for the most part but it was the ending that put me off. I really did not want to see Ghost Dog die in that way, at the hands of a white man who did not understand him or his philosophy. I wish that Forrest Whitaker's character could have shown more determination to fight and survive, with more of what the samurai author of Hagakure would have called ""martial valor"". But then isn't it the juxtaposition of the cold, efficient samurai code with this gentle, somewhat bemused giant part of what makes the film interesting? Come to think of it, the samurai were more concerned with an honourable death than with mere survival. A better ending, at least for me, would have had Ghost Dog choosing, at the very last moment, to survive rather than follow the samurai code into the grave."
2,Not Forest Whitaker's best performance.,"GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI was surprisingly bad. I find it hard to believe that Forest Whitaker would have accepted such a badly written script. I found it hard to decide if the movie was trying to be comical or if the acting and the script were so bad that it just appeared funny.Throughout the movie Whitaker's character, ""Ghost Dog"", reads passages from a Samurai warriors guide book. I assume the readings are supposed to give the viewer a philosophical look into the chaarters ideology. At first these readings are sort of amusing (again, I do not think that is their intention) but later these reading become down right annoying.This a ""B"" movie at best."
2,Jarmusch's garbage is better than typical top movies,"Upon attaining popular acceptance, many directors seem to feel the need to make a film in their own style. This film is Jim Jarmusch making a ""Jim Jarmusch"" film. He affects and overplays his traditional quirkiness to excess. Jarmusch could have cut a few of the side stories and focussed on the main character's ethical struggle. The movie ends up a bit confused.That being said, a 2-star Jarmusch movie is much more worth one's time and attention than the latest Nicholas Cage shoot-em-up chase scene tender chick flick.This movie is worth a look merely for the moods Jarmusch creates. He creates a setting that a movie viewer can sit in front of for hours. The movie falls apart 2/3 the way through, and will have one rolling one's eyes by the end."
2,Almost a great film. Almost,"The italian actors screw up an otherwise wonderful film. I don't like hip hop, but i suffered through it. I love the main character. Very good acting job by Whittaker."
2,Disappointing,"The movie ""Ghost Dog"" fails mainly due to it's cop-out of an ending. The self-sacrifice of the main character Ghost Dog to his Mafioso master doesn't work, it's too easy, too formulaic. The character learns nothing in his exploits. He fails to see his chosen ""Master"" for what he is. The story would have worked better if Ghost Dog had stopped to realize that he was making a fatal mistake with his slave-like dedication to the samurai code. The action offers Ghost Dog many opportunities for that brilliant flash of insight but he is too dedicated and loyal to step off the warrior path to see it for what it really is. Also, the scene where Ghost Dog kills his victim by shooting up through the plumbing is a joke. Ask any plumber. Jarmusch should have known better."
4,Great Movie,"To say the least it is like ""The Professional"" meets ""The Seven Samurai"". An excellent movie that tells a great story of a professional hitman/modern day samuai. A great crime drama that makes you think about the vows of honor that are involved in life."
5,Genuine.,"Forest Whitaker is one of my favorite actors. This film offers plenty, from murder scenes to deep and ancient eastern philosophies to exciting grand theft auto moments. The music was done by Wu Tang heavyweight The Rza. Ghost Dog is one of those movies where you actually take something from it and/or see something in the characters that you see in yourself and/or others. Forest Whitaker does a wonderful job in potraying an elusive hit man for the mob who adopts an eastern samurai philosophy and implements this into his daily life. Rza's beats compliment this cold and tragic yet rugged film in all it's emotions. The cast for the mob aren't big time hollywood faces that you would normally associate with crime families and I enjoyed it. This film will not dissapoint you, buy it."
5,The Way,"Most, if not all of the reviewers seem to have missed the important point of this film, even the ones that liked it, to me this film was about Buddhism. And I thought it was incredible the way they laced these ideas onto a wierd looking quirky film and sublime soundtrack. Every frame was full of meaning, but maybe a bit difficult for the average westener to pick up on. I'd recommend meditating on impermanence and suffering before watching it."
4,Jim Jarmusch's Most Mature Work To Date (And Best),"While I've always enjoyed Jarmusch's films, I've also been of the unpopular opinion (among the cult of the uberhip) that his work was far, far overrated. While varying greatly in quality, his films have always quietly satisfied me.I was very pleasantly surprised to find this by far his most mature work to date. Understated and poignant while never boring, Ghost Dog is a highly stylized character study of a modern day Samarai, a hit man who takes on the mob -- the same mob to which his master belongs.Jarmusch also had the supreme good luck to secure The RZA to score this flick. His quiet, melodic, raw hip hop groove match the mood of the action perfectly.I'd give it four and a half if that was an option. Worth your while."
4,Not your Fathers action flick.,"Ghost Dog is a mixed bag, a guilty pleasure where else do you get 60 yr old Italian mobsters rapping a Public Enemy song? A French speaking Ice Cream Vendor, And Forrest Whitaker as a modern day Samurai? The Film is filled with a Quirky charm. Not your run of the mill ""Romeo Must Die"" Kind of Action film. It requires a little Patience and a sense of humor but well worth it."
4,Ghost Dog,"I thought this was a pretty good movie. It moved a little slow, but I thought the storyline was pretty good and the acting also. I think the movie is pretty much just worth the rent, and I rented it. Overall I liked the action, I wish Ghost Dog would have used his sword that would be been some tight stuff, but the gun was good enough. He was ruthless, and did what had to be done. I thought that it was also a good add to the movie by having a mob in their, to give a different twist to it and it did that well. One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Ghost Dog shoots the guy throught the sink, that was some crazy stuff! One of the good stuff also was the music, when he was playin Killah Priest in his car, keepin it Hip-Hop!!!Its hard to say whether I recommend this movie or not, I mean its the type of movie either you DO like or you DONT like. So read the reviews before checking it out!!! But overall a pretty good movie too me."
4,Fascinating Vergence of Cultures,"This is a different kind of movie. The main character models his life to fit the ancient philosophy of the Samurai. (warning: possible spoilers) He has sworn to serve the man who saved his life, who happens to be a member of a Mafia family. The tone of the film is contemplative, scenes interspersed with readings from an ancient Samurai text. I found the three characters who headed the Mafia family to be very entertaining in and of themselves. The film is also laced with cartoons, which the Italian characters are watching. They are mostly violent chartoons, and provide an interesting comparison to the storyline. The music was interesting and very well-matched to the film. There is a documentary included in the film, which is mostly a report of the vision behind the film. There are also a few outtakes, a music video and musical selection. There is much to see here. Highly recommended."
3,You can learn from the photos,"Sort of a quandary here...if you're advanced enough in photography to be working with studio lighting, do you really need detailed, step-by-step instructions in lighting setups? It almost seems as if readers are expecting a beginners book that at the same time provides professional techniques.That said, I will admit that the specifics are a bit lacking here, so if you do need a lot of hand-holding, you're better off with a different book. However, the illustrations are excellent, and you can learn a great deal just from Neubart's photos. If you're open to exposure to interesting lighting techniques, this book will surely add some valuable ideas to your repertoire."
3,"A Nice book, but not a ""core"" manual in my opinion","This book has some interesting ideas and some very cool setups, but it is not really for someone looking to learn and understand more about the technique of lighting. If you are looking for something to help with ideas for lighting in certain situations, this book is helpful. I also do not recommend this book to someone who does not have a lot of equipment at their disposal, as most of the setup require half a dozen lights and tons of other tools as well."
2,Where's the beef?,"The book was a bit of a false alarm (for me) in that I expected more detail in the how to parts. Don't mean to be unkind, but I feel the photo's were a bit dated as well."
1,This book is waste of money,This book is crap. It teaches absolutely nothing. It doesn't show any lighting set ups. The author just talk about what he did without any image. Even explanations are not precise and helpful.
4,nice book,I like that book. I'm learing a lot of professional lighting solutions ... And I think it's a good book for pro photographer.
2,Good Book + No Diagrams = Not that good of a Book,"don't' get me wrong' this book got lots of images i wanted to create myself, simple diagram for each shoot would give me the general idea how to create such shoot.Although they explain this in words, as photographers they should know the saying ""one picture worth 1000 words""They invested more in the fancy look of the book and words to fill it upif u ask me, i rather have the set picture, the final pictures and the steps with simple explanation why the client asked and what they did to achieve the goalfor conclusion, they gave you a manual how to do technical stuff in words and not with pictures, that means there are ""gray areas"" and much harder to understand the small technical stuff they do."
2,"Sadly, a disappointment.","I wanted to like this book very badly, but it pretty much flopped.Please preview the book at the store online or in a store before you buy it. It's not very full of helpful teachings as other books out there.You'd be much better off buyingLight: Science and Magic: An Introduction to Photographic LightingandCreative Lighting Techniques for Studio Photographerswhich are amazing."

4,Old-fashioned America...,"This is a quaint, old book, well-written, but with the same style and archetypes as Alger's many other works. Still, it provides an interesting look into America before the turn of the 20th Century, and makes a good book to read by the fireplace."
5,"Solid product, great to have in the pantry.","I think the best thing about this product is the convenience. Little pouches that can sit on the shelf for a while and cook up quick and delicious. These are FAR better than anything I have found in a can. My only complaint is that in my opinion the cooking measurements are way off-- I think they suggest you use too much water when cooking the beans.One of our favorite ways to serve the beans are to saute some chopped onion, sweet bell pepper, and jalapeno and then add the water (way less than it says to!) and beans to the pot. Stir in some shredded cheddar at the end and you have a pretty decent bean dip for chips."
5,Great product ...,I have ordered this product several times and I am never disappointed. Great Santa Fe Southwestern Style Refried Beans I will definitely purchase again.
5,Extremely good!,"It's already been said over and over, but these are SO much better than canned. I honestly can't eat canned because they taste so bad but I love these! The best part? They're ready in like 5 minutes :-)"
1,Contains interesterified oil!!!!,"I would never have purchased this product if I had realized that it contains interesterified oil. From Dr. Weil's website: ""A study published in the January 15, 2007, issue of Nutrition Metabolism found that interesterified fats and trans fats had similar, negative effects. Both increased total cholesterol, raised ""bad"" LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol and lowered ""good"" HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. Another negative: the interesterified fat also raised fasting blood glucose by almost 20 percent."" There are plenty of other studies out there, as well.I eat things like refried beans because they are supposed to be healthful. Interesterfied fats are a sneaky way for manufacturers to avoid saying that their product contains trans fats! I am so completely disgusted by the fact that I foolishly bought this inedible product. I would not give it away; it is going right into the trash. I feel totally ripped off."
2,Good but,"These beans taste good and are pretty easy to prepare. Salt content is too high. The real problem is that the vendor may have become a bit too greedy and raised the price significantly. At around $16 bucks, they seemed to be an ok deal. Now that they're nearly $20, I'm not so sure. I could buy 25 cans of 79 cent refried beans for $20 that don't need reconstituting, have less salt, and work just as well."
5,Taste of Tex-Mex,I moved to New York two years ago and the thing I miss most about Texas is good Tex-Mex food. Santa Fe Beans can compete with the best refried beans in any of my favorite restaurants back home and it is way easier than preparing beans for one from scratch.
4,Quick & Easy,"This is a great product to have in your pantry. Unlike other reviewers, I do not think these taste as good as homemade. I do think they taste terrific and are the next best thing to homemade. They are definitely superior to canned beans.Add to that the easy of use, being able to make single/small portions for spontaneous meals on the run and you've got a great go-to ingredient on your shelf."
5,His Voice Alone Is Music,I have had this CD since the first season it was released. It's a permanent part of my traveling CD connection. I play it in the car even when it's not Christmas. Hearing such a beautiful voice singing my favorite Christmas songs brings me enormous pleasure.

2,Intro to Research,"Required textbook -- while it's a fairly easy read, there are SO MANY mistakes in the book, especially in the charts and graphs. I spent hours trying to make sense of one table, asking other people to work the problems, and everyone came up with the same answer...which was different from the book. The professor worked through the problem and realized the textbook was incorrect. That was the first of many issues that were discovered over the course of the semester. If you have to have this edition (or even future editions) be careful with the numbers!"
3,Needs to written better.,This book is hard to understand. Terms are too vague. I would have liked some clearer information about how to statistics.
2,Too much writing,"The item description did not indicate that the book had been written in. It is not only written in, but every other sentence is underlined."
3,Intro to Research in Ed,"The book itself is quality. However, I was told it was ""Like new"" when it was not. The book I received had some highlighting and the pages were barely attached as the binding was separating. I was not overly impressed with it."
2,"It was the international edition, which she did not specify on the add, but it worked ok! Never responded back to me though!",The fact that it was an international version was not specified!!! And did not get back to me about information. NOT OK!
