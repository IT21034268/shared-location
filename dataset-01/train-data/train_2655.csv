2,Like watching fruit rot on the vine,"After the first flawless Motown box set finished up with 1971, it was inevitable that there was going to be a drop in quality on the second volume. When Stevie Wonder's contribution to disc two is the masterful ""Sir Duke"" and just one disc later we're hit with the wretched-without-bounds ""I Just Called to Say I Love You,"" it's virtually impossible to wonder where it all went wrong. Closing out the set with the hilariously mawkish ""End of the Road"" by Boyz II Men is the sadly appropriate death knell for a once proud label that lost its way. It's hard to connect most of this music to the label that once released 'Innervisions' or 'What's Going On' or 'Cloud Nine'."
2,Hitsville USA-The Motown Singles Collection 1972-1992,"I listened to each disc twice and there were some singles that were mega hits but a lot of the stuff was unfamiliar to me. Motown blew it when they left the Motor City for the smoggy skies of the City of Angels. When the Funk Brothers sound was replaced by the Wrecking Crew so went the unique groove and indelibly stamped signature of the music. The salvation of Motown, post-Detroit, was the OUTSTANDING bass work by Carol Kaye. Did you all know that Carol Kaye was responsible for the incredible bass lines on the Beach Boys ""Good Vibrations"" and Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots Were Made For Walking"" studio recordings? Anyway, in my opinion, the FIRST boxed set was the REAL DEAL!"
1,Disappointed,"I have 2 sony blu-ray 3D players and this DVD would not play in either. However, the cane-toads one which is related played.Be forewarned. I've never had to return something through Amazon, but looks like this one will be my learning experience.If you are in the US and thinking of purchasing this, I'd wait until they figure out what went wrong."
1,Doesn't Play,I have a PS3 a Sony and LG 3D players and it won't play on any player .You might want to reconsider taking a chance on this.!!!
1,Not region free disc,"I got Sony 3D player/ Sony 3D tv that play other 3D discs well, not this one. I got it below $8 and not worth the effort to return it. I pop it in and it just don't play. I'm in USA. One star rating is for the disc not playing, not a region free product."
3,Could be better,"If you can hear sound but no picture, just pressed the next chapter button and it will play.The 3D is good and the scenery is nice but why just 3 stars. The pace is slow and they don't show any predators hunting. Perhaps it is because of the E rating that they have to cut out the graphic scenes..."
4,"Good Product, it equal to store bought","Pros: It's same as I have used in school, work, and personal art hobbies for years so its reliable, easy to use, and great for all skill levels.Cons: It's only half the quantity for the same cost as in the local stores; that is not even counting in the cost of shipping. I hoped it was a new better product then what I been using, but it turned out to be the same... oh well..."
5,Worked great,"After the passing of my little Schipperke girl dog, I wanted to preserve her paw impression in a well traveled route she took in our yard. The material is fast drying and very durable. I only had one opportunity to preserve my little girls print as it was fading and the process would have destroyed it. I am so glad I used this product to ensure success. I am also so thankful this product worked as described. Now I have a memory of my baby from when she was alive and healthy...."
5,"A terrific book for ""All Ages""","I really need help - I want to have my 91 yr old Dad [a former China Marine] know of this, but since he is now blind, due to macular-degeneration, he would need to have an audio book. He is still a fine ""former Marine"" with a most alert mind. In fact he just recently heard from another Marine he served with in China through a Marine publication. Any information you can send me at my email address would be appreciated. I grew up with SEMPER FI during WWII, as my Dad re-inlisted in The Marine Corps. after many years in civilian life. He did not want to be drafted into the Army, altho he was the father of 2 children! I spent 27 years as the wife of an Air Force Fighter Pilot & we now share 43 years together. This is not a review - but I do hope someone reads this & can give me some information. Thank you - so very much."
3,Facile overlay of Marine Corps culture on private sector,"The US Marine Corps is a fine fighting machine, led by some outstanding leaders. However, simply superimposing Marine culture on the private sector struck me as too simplistic.The authors make some very good points on organization and leadership, but I would have appreciated at least some ""this Marine Corps practice won't work"" in the commercial sector observations.Instead we got this somewhat forced overlay of Marine Corps traditions on the corporate environment."
5,Time proven accomplishments of the United States Marine Corp,"I have just read your book Semper Fi, and wanted to say that I enjoyed it very much. Many of the things brought out in your book I have been using with my crew and didn't realize it. It has made me realize that I need to do it better to help them create a more effictive team. A lot of the skills I learned in the Marine Corps made a bigger impression than I thought. Semper Fi.John Draper Former Marine and Vietnam veteran 1964 - 1967"
4,A good resource for both business and military leaders.,"This book provides in-depth information as to how the Marines create and maintain a high level of leadership skills among all ranks. These examples are then used to provide practical recommendations for business leaders. The authors appear to have a good perspective from both sides of the coin, and realize that companies do not need to begin requiring uniforms and shaved heads, in order to copy the success enjoyed by the Marines.The book provides examples and recommendations that are aimed at a variety of management levels. Also included is a good section that covers recruiting, and how to keep the quality personnel in your organization.As a former active-duty Marine officer, and an employee in the private sector, I found this book a worthwhile read."
4,Pretty good,"It's a good book. There are a lot of leadership techniques in here that can be applied. There is also a lot of information about the Marines, which is interesting. For a leadership book, I could have used less information about the Marines and more about leadership in business, but it's good for what it is.One thing, the chapter on women dealt with sexual harrassment, mostly. I think that with everything women deal with (lower pay, glass ceiling, family life, etc) there could have been more info on women and less on sexual harrassment. That could have been a seperate chapter."
5,An Extremely Professional Approach To Business !,"We Marines use Leadership Traits and Principles to discharge our duties with an almost reflex like attitude. Understanding these Traits and Principles is one thing, applying then to Business in a practical and simple way is ingenious. On behalf of Marines everywhere, ""Well Done, Marines"""

4,A good place to start...,"I've used unix quite a bit but never really knew what all I was doing. This book helped put some ground under my feet. It wont teach you everything (and my only gripe is it doesn't go into enough of the tough stuff) but it covers most everything you need to USE unix. Look to other books for administration, installation or troubleshooting."
3,UNIX for Dummies,Was written in away that was easy to follow and understand. This is a good supplement to the books required for class.
5,UNIX for Dummies,"This book is VERY Helpful and entertaining, if a book on a computer language could ever be described that way. Best few dollars I ever spent."
4,as advertised,"This book was for my son, who is interested in programming. It was mailed to him quickly and as advertised."
4,Great choice for UNIX begginers,"This was my first UNIX book, back in 1998., and it was a great introduction. I always get sentimental when I see on the shelf! Ten years later, I can't imagine my life without Unix (in its various varieties) -- and I'm sure that this book deserves part of credit for that.As I said, this is a great introduction -- but after reading it, you should immediately move to another, more advanced book."
5,Unix for Dummies Is A Must,"I am very computer literate and I have no clue on how to use Unix. I tried Unix for Dummies and now that I know the basics, I'm an expert at it"
2,"Worth reading, but not paying","I recommend checking this book out from your library, but definitely not paying for it. There are many internet guides which are free and do cover the same amount of information. The most aggravating aspect of this book is the vacuous writing style, which the authors apparently believe is funny or cute. Every paragraph contains an aside aimed at criticizing the operating system or reveling in the concept of stupidity. It feels patronizing and detracting when the authors refer to an apparent ""need"" for UNIX to be complicated, or the inevitability of the user's typos.The book is helpful in introducing the operating system, despite its poor presentation. It is worth looking over, but not paying full price, as the information it contains can be found elsewhere. I did enjoy the more or less step-by-step presentation of many commands, as well as tips for avoiding common mistakes."
2,almost useless,"I'm an experienced computer geek who hasn't used Unix in many years. I found this book very difficult to use (although very easy to read, which is why I gave 2 stars and not 1). If you prefer a tutorial approach, Teach Yourself Unix in 24 Hours is a much better buy."
1,You will remain a 'dummie',"I have been using unix for 8 years. I bought this book for my wife without taking a good look first. What a piece of junk. It leaves out so many important basics and wastes far too much space on internet stuff. Not surprising since the authors also wrote the 'dummies' internet book. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this book."
1,Very confusing text,"Figured i would buy this entry level text to learn some basics of unix on a Mac. Big Mistake! Entry level text books should be written on the lowest level, this seems to be written for intermediate level users.Very disappointing. I will stay away from this ______ for Dummies books in the future."
2,Odd choice of content,"Setting up your own NetBSD or other UNIX system, or looking to tune your web server? Forget this book.Written for those who are being given an already-set-up UNIX system run by a caring ""guru,"" and who apparently do not need to do anything but write and print with it, UNIX for Dummies almost completely ignores common problems of UNIX users, such as serving Web sites, recycling an old machine as a SAMBA file server, and, basically, most anything involving setting up a new UNIX system. Yes, I enjoyed the sarcastic history, though they only gave credit to people via first names. They also seemed to spend more time trashing UNIX and its various utilities than actually telling us how to use them.Parts seem outdated, though this is the fourth edition.Aside from a readable guide to vi - with no real advice on setting up, say, pico - this book was of no use to me. But you probably knew that by now."
2,Not as good as the others,"I am a big admirer of the Dummies books. I bought the Internet and Internet2 for dummies, and was really impressed. But this book really didn't help out all that much. It had a lot on the history of Unix (Who cares) and not a lot of hard core, learning what Unix is all about. It had some good tips, but you may want to borrow it from a friend first before you go out and buy your own copy."
2,I don't trust him,"As soon as he said he was headed to Chevy's, but stumbled on the reviewed restaurant instead, I tossed the book away and haven't picked it up since. Anyone who would seek out Chevy's over one of the many other SF establishments is not to be trusted as a food authority."
5,"It was fun in the 60's, now its fun in my 60's","I had a similar toy in the 1960's called the SOMA cube and played with it for hours. It develops your spatial viewing of problems and a bit of logical thinking. This toy is the same thing as the SOMA cube only it comes with a deck of cards that contains 60 3-D puzzles to try. On the back of each card is a solution to the problem. In one or two cases, the 3-D picture on the front of the card doesn't show clearly what the BACK of the puzzle looks like, but this is minor. A wonderful toy that will keep kids (or adults) quiet for a long time. And it doesn't need batteries or electricity. A true thinking toy."
5,Hard than it looks,"After reading some reviews of this toy on another website I decided to buy it for my son, who is turning 8 in 2 months, for a trip we were taking. The first puzzle had us stumped and we needed to use the hints on the back. This game is much harder than it looks and while my child likes to try to do it, I think it is better suited for older kids. He still likes to play with it and we use the hints on the back for help. I consider myself fairly intelligent and even I have a tough time with this."
4,Difficult for Adults - Impossible for Kids!,"I bought this for my 5th grade classroom. My kids go crazy over this and the ""Brick by Brick"" game as well. This 3-dimensional puzzle was very challenging for my husband and myself. I took it to school and my students find this game particularly frustrating. I would recommend this game to a teacher with an older classroom. The game says ages 8+ but I think it should be more appropriately labeled 12+ because of the difficulty."
2,Quite difficult,I purchased this for my 8 year old son's birthday and we both found it too difficult. I'll admit that I'm not the best at this type of thing but even I thought it was very frustrating and not worth the energy.
4,Really Smart and Different,"Another winner from the long list of Red Dress Ink books. With so many wonderful and talented American authors out there --- it's so nice to them getting recognized and discussed.Betsy Burke's ""Lucy's Launderette"" is a hilarious and really weird romp into the world of stalker brothers, pot head roommates and deceased grandparents. It's a refreshing tale of redemption and getting on with your life. I found it fun, quirky and really unique. Loved the backdrop and thought that Burke's talent was really highlighted in the way she does dialog.Love it and would recommend to others!Cheers!"
3,"Fast-paced, enjoyable reading!","This is an interesting story about a struggling artist, and how she graciously handles her burden of responsibility. Lucy is a likeable protagonist, surrounded by quirky secondary characters and lots of bizarre situations. I was a bit putt-off by the indifferent attitude the characters exhibited towards casual sex with multiple partners, which was quite prevalent in this novel, however the depth of the plot and the well-developed characters was strong enough to compensate for that."
4,One of RDI winners,"I enjoyed the change of scenery for one of RDI books. Having been to Vancouver B.C. many times, I recognized many of the locations. Lucy's story wasn't as shallow as some of the other RDI books are. I really liked the way Lucy's character grew up and the quirkiness of the other characters was charming (June, Winky, Reebee). I'm glad I picked this up. After Thin Pink Line and Carrie Pilby, I didn't want to read any more RDI."
3,Not what it seems,Directions are difficult to follow. Some items pictured on the cover (i.e. Christmas tree) were not included in the book. My daughter was disappointed.
5,Memories of an evening in Firenze,My wife and I were walking around Florence and heard this heavenly music from a courtyard. We walked in and Remsky was playing violin against a recording of background instruments. We bought his CD (probably burned in his computer) from him on the street. It's magnificent and one of my favorites.
5,"GR8 CD....A MUST 4 ANY ""MICHAEL JACKSON FAN""!!!!","EVERY SONG ON DIS ALBUM IZ GR8 & IT IZ A MUST 4 ANY ""MICHAEL JACKSON & DA JACKSON 5 FANS""....MOST OF DA SONGS DAT WERE ON DA ""MINI-SERIES"" IZ ON HERE....GR8 ALBUM....WORTH DA MONEY!!!!"
4,champion,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. It did have a fairytale quality and was very romantic. I would also like to add Fabio did not actually write this himself. He had the assistance of a ghost writer and I think ""She"" did a very good job."
4,Swept Away,"This book was one of the best books I have read in a long time. It had the things I like in a romance, a dashing knight, a beautiful princess, and of course the bad guy. This book is for all those who love it when the hero has to fight for his lady."
4,Spicy and Romantic at the same time,"This book had a wonderful, fairy-tale quality. The beginning of the story read a little slow, but the story picked up and proved to be a very charming tale. I enjoyed it. I'm a delicate reader and it's what I would consider a ""safe read"", which I very much appreciate. Fabio has picked himself up another reader!"
5,Easy replacement,"I ordered this to replace an old Toro 53300 that was leaking. It was very easy to install. I work slowly, so it took about 30 minutes to remove the old one and install this new one. The old one could have been serviced with a repair kit (the O-rings had worn out), but I prefer having a whole new assembly. I don't have any problem with this being a plastic valve because the rest of the irrigation system is PVC and plastic, too.The old PVB lasted (I'm guessing when the previous owner installed) about 10 years before it developed a leak. So I expect a similar lifespan for this part."
5,Work's well,I have an old irrigation system with a part that looked just like this that wore out. I was able to replace the old one with the new one in minutes with basic tools.
2,Cheap and lasted about 2 years until first hard freeze,"I live in west central Florida, this product worked okay for a few years until we had a hard freeze for a few hours. The first freeze it saw caused it to break when the temperature got above freezing again. Good thing it has the input shutoff. I will replace this with a better unit that is not made of plastic."
1,Poor Design,Vacumn valve is a poor design. Nearly impossible to keep the o-rings in the vertical portion aligned during installation. Valve has malfunctioned twice in the first week of use.
4,Good product but need to be replaced every few years,"Very easy to install, all you have to do is to screw to the pipe, took me less than 15 min to remove and install. I prefer this one over the metal because the metal one required cutting the pipe (or solder) to install while this one does not.The only bad thing about this one is that it will leak after a few years and will need to be replaced. I have to replace a new one after every five years."
1,Second one of these that cracked,"Near the coast in San Diego, CA we NEVER have a freeze. But this is the second one of these valves that has cracked. Once on the main body and once the nut on the union just split in half. Each one lasted about 2 years. I will definitely be replacing it with a metal backflow preventer. Spend a little extra unless you don't mind a flood and frequent replacement."
4,Toro PVB,The PVB arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I was expecting with no surprises. Installed as easily as it looks (be sure to pay attention to the water flow directional arrow) and works fine.
1,Certified Backfow Assembly Tester,"This backflow preventer is not approved by authorities in Washington state, and probably no other. Being constructed of plastic, it is prone to freeze damage."
3,Understanding Catholic Christianity,"As a student at a Catholic school I've had to read this for my religion class. I am not a Catholic and I found that this book gave me a good understanding of the Catholic faith, hence the title of the book, but I also found that it focused a lot on developing and understanding you (me) an individual and that its purpose was not to try to convert me to the Catholic religion."
4,Very handy wipes for lazy me.,"These are the greatest for cleaning make-up off the face before bed. Not only do they clean well, getting off mascara and blush beautifully, but they also moisturize. And it's so much handier to use one of these wipes than it is to wash off the face in the sink, where I always manage to wet my hair when I don't want to. The only issue I have with the purchase online is that buying one packet here, you're paying almost as much again in shipping as the cost of the packet. Either buy from Target or Walmart, where the price is just under $6, or order the 3-pack setOlay Regenerist Micro-Exfoliating Wet Cleansing Cloths, 30 Count (Pack of 3). That's the better deal."
2,A Hasty Job,"I have found more faulty references in this book than helpful ones. I'll cite just one example. I wanted to find out more about the ""Find"" function in Panther, in particular about how to extract the location of the ""found"" file when I'm looking at a trail of unnamed ""folder"" icons. The index sent me to page 82 (the only reference to ""Find""). The information there was a tiny paragraph languishing under the heading ""Desktop Madness."" It said, ""Use the Files->Find command when you can't remember where you put it in a file or folder."" (sic). Then the second and last sentence: ""This command is a Mac OS X feature that really kicks some butt. I discuss it in detail in chaper 12."" Guess what? Chapter 12 is called ""The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing."" No more references to ""Find."" You know whose butt I'd like to kick. Enough said."
2,dummie dumb dum,"The book is basic. It doesn't describe widgets. file transfers from the PC. It is just a basic book with cute phrases, but basically a loser. A better book is the Missing Manual."
2,Very Average,While I was Glad that Smokey RObinson came back strong most of the other material here is pure Formula.Remember The Prince CLone of The moment Giorgio?&this wasn't even the video version which was far better.Chico Debarge not happening here nor Bruce Willis?? What was Motown thinking?Stevie Wonder is so/so with Skeletons.
1,IT Technical Analyst,"I regret I purchased this product. It never work in my HP iPaq hx2110. I had try everthing, download newer driver from AmbiCom websiet and tried troublshoot tips from website. Nothing work!I also purchased a Linksys WCF54G from Amazon and it works in the same HP iPaq hx2110 without any problem.Can I return AmiCom Wireless CF card and exchange for something else?"
2,Disappointing.,"The description for this adapter claims to support ""full privacy"". Don't expect that it means ""supports anything better than old, WEP-standard security""--it doesn't. The typos on the box copy should have been a clue.With some hesitation, I returned this adapter foranother one by the same company, and the difference was surprising. For only a few dollars more, you get a 802.11g-capable card that supports the more-secure WPA standard, and what appear to be much better drivers.For the small difference in price, there's no reason to buy this card instead of the 802.11g model."
1,AmbiCom WL1100C-CF Compactflash 11MBPS Adapter,"I tried to use it in my Dell X50 and it hardly worked, was too slow, too short range, you have to unplug and plug it bacl again and again.I other words, do not buy this if you have a Dell X50, you will just waste your money and time trying to make it work."
5,woody hot dude rocks the world.,"i'm very pleased with the ""strummin woody doll,i read the reviews of other people about ""buzz lightyear and the quality of the buzz lightyear doll, they are so wrong about the quality of the strummin woody doll and the buzz lightyear doll.i'm very pleased about both dolls the construction of ""buzz lightyear and strummin woody is excellant in my book no complaints on either buzz lightyear and the strummin woody dolls."
5,Singin' Woody,I love this toy so much because it is one of my favorites. I wonder when it gets back soon.
1,Deceiving description,"I thought I was purchasing cymbals. This statement above says cymbal pack, Hi-hat and Cymbals. when lo and behold on XMAS all my grandson got was mute pads. This is not what we wanted. Second disappointing item for XMAS this year. I am truly surprised at Amazon."
2,Not a fan,Not a fan of these mutes. Mostly because you have to stick the bass drum mute on with velcro. Changes the sound of the bass drum all because of a few strips of velcro. Not cool.
2,Lacks too many common sense features...,"Cons1) No shuffle2) No Playlists3) Resarts AT THE FIRST SONG each time you turn it onThe combination of these 3 shortcomings means you listen to all the songs alphabetically, from thebeginning each time you turn it on :(4) Very slow file transfer (why no USB 2.0???)Pros1) Great sound2) Great controls3) Very small and light4) Very sharp lookingBottom Line:Would put up with it's shortcomings if it were half the price... she's goin' back!"
1,BAD PRODUCTS - NO SUPPORT - DON'T PURCHASE BUSLINK PRODUCTS,"I bought a Buslink Mp3 player in a Datavision Store in NY (Datavision is a big reseller, listed in Buslink page).The unit sound volume is weak, but this is not the problem. After just 3 months of use the unit wont play mp3 anymore, the screen went crazy every time I start it, and then froze. I contacted Buslink to got a replacement but I got THE WORST SUPPORT, INDIFERENCE AND BAD ATTENTION from they, particulary from Ivan Smith, customer support. Walk away from Buslink. They cannot replace the unit without the invoice from Datavision, they do not honor your waste , confidence nor preference. Stay away from Buslink, a unit that lasted only 3 months and they wont replace. I REPEAT, THE WORST QUALITY AND SUPPORT I GOT IN TONS OF PURCHASES. DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM BUSLINK"
2,Overpriced...,"got it for Christmas :)...After going through the manual listened to some different styles mp3s... :1. The earphones suck... can't use :(2. The sound of Beethoven Piano Sonata No. 14 'Moonlight' - 1 Adagio Sostenuto was horrible :( Besides the low quality, there was some additinal background noise... So it sucked...3. Loud rock is ok kinda :(So I'm ready to return the product..."
2,"Good Price, Nice Size Limited Formats",The price and size are great but it only plays Mp3s. If you use Napster or WMAs this unit will not play your files.
1,Poor Voice Recording Quality,"I bought this primarily to record my thoughts while I was out and about and am very disappointed with the voice recording quality. It is hollow and sounds like I have a lisp.Anyhow, I wasn't too disappointed with the audio playback quality, but that may be because my expectations had been significantly diminished by the time I evaluated that part of the player.I would recommend that you save your money and look at something else."
4,Good product,"This is a Pretty good product. I installed it and my computer had trouble recognizing it, or even starting up for that matter, removed card, booted fine. anyways i played around until i could get to the desktop and install the correct driver for it. I dont know if it was my computer or the card, but its not important, its working now:)"
4,"BEAUTIFUL TILE TABLE- BUT A LITTLE BIT ON THE ""WOBBLY"" SIDE","I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE AESTHETICS OF THIS TABLE. IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL NEXT TO OUR DARK BLUE POOL; THE GREENS AND BLUES OF THE GLASS TILE ARE GORGEOUS- WE HAVE RECEIVED MANY COMPLIMENTS.ONE CONCERN: THE TABLE LEGS ARE A BIT UNSTEADY, AND THE RUBBER ""FEET"" THAT COVER THE BOTTOM OF THE FOUR LEGS ARE CHEAP AND COME OFF NOW AND AGAIN. A DOG RUNNING BY (LIKE OUR LABS) CAN KNOCK THIS TABLE RIGHT OVER IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL. PLACE ON EVEN SURFACE- NOT GRASS."
5,EXCELLENT BOX.,VERY GOOD SHOW. EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE OF WAYLON. I RECOMMEND ALL THAT LIKE THE MUSIC COUNTRY. RELATION SHIP VERY GOOD. WARRANTY OF SATISFACTION.
2,No color for the art book in kindle edition,"I am using iPad version of Kindle that can display colors.This book is also an art book, and displaying the arts in black and whiteis meaningless. While I understand Amazon's black and white only Kindlefor low battery consumption and cheap price, I will never buy such device(that can handle only black and white).Even though Kindle device is itself black and white, I hope thatthe contents be in color, since there are Kindle readers that can displaycolors, like iPad Kindle (Mac Kindle, PC Kindle) and so on."
1,"gave it away, fool me once","Never too old to learn...absolutely no where in the description or other infomation is it stated that the music is synthesized!!! What a disappointment to listen to this CD compilation. It is apparently a children's CD which is not stated anywhere either. In retrospect, two big clues that I will pay attention to when shopping for music: the pieces were listed and only the COMPOSER was noted--not the performer artist/orchestra. Also, the label, ""Big Blue Dog""....it was a dog, alright. I reluctantly gave it to my co worker for her grandchildren. I hesitated because I think everyone, no matter what age, deserves to listen to only the best performances of any kind of music."
3,Filter works great cannot get replacements,"I want to say the actual hepa filter works great. Too bad it takes months to get replacement filters. Ordered mine in November and it's already the middle of January and it's still on back order. Cannot speak directly to a Holmes representative in customer service they seem to have some problems at the present time. If I were to purchase another one, I would order a replacement filter at the time you purchase it and then you may have it when you need it."
2,bad buy,"This machine is noisy and the filters? I can't find them anywhere! If I buy them online, they cost an arm and a leg! So, I've had this thing for about 2 years now, and since the filter only lasted for about a month, it's just been sitting there, collecting dust! So, I guess it's collecting dust in one aspect! In my opinion, it's just not a good buy. I'm going to try one of those Ionic Breeze purifiers now, wish me luck!"
2,expensive & noisy,"I have owned two of these units. The mftr says the filters should last several months (4-6). If there is a smoker in the house...good luck getting 6 weeks out of it. At the local retailer the filters cost nearly as much as the units original purchase price and I have to buy about 6 filters a year at a high cost. My mother-in-law needs hearing aids. If we turn on the unit she takes out her hearing aids because Hurricane Andrew is in the place. (That's on the LOW fan setting.) When I turn it off,then she goes to coughing and hacking and opens the windows in the middle of the winter. If left on all night during sleep it works. During the day it can't keep up in an efficiency apartment."
3,NOT IMPRESSED...,"I still have to buy ANOTHER air purifier, this one just seems inadequate..or is it me?? I'm allergic to my ""home""..still! I have put this ""TABLETOP"" right up on me...it appears to be doing very little.The ""grill"" is very hard to clean. The ""HEPA"" holds large ""particles"" right there in front. I cant find replacement filters. The ""Order"" form for replacements is ""Confusing""...and it IS loud, not soothing at all; I end up with a headache. I'd like to turn it off, but ""perhaps"" it IS doing something to help??"
3,Average filter,"I have owned this unit for 5 years. There are a lot of better units out there, but for small rooms it does the job. I have bought only 4 filters (1 new per year). Every month I wash the prefilter and vacuum the unit clean. I also use Dryer Sheets (bounce, downey, Target brand, etc...) that I change every two weeks. Just put one over the HEPA filter and behind the prefilter. Very cheap to toss and replace and makes the room smell nice too!"
2,The replacement filters cost to much.,"If I would have known the main filter inside cost almost $20 to replace, I would have never bought this item. I called the company and they said you could only buy the filter from them over the phone. And it is paper and not washable. Only the thin prefilter is washable. Shipping cost alone for the 1 filter was around 6 bucks. And it needed to be changed in less than 2 months time."
2,Dream On If You Think THis Can Really Clean A Room,"I bought this product for a fan sound when I sleep since I like that sound for sleeping. If you expect it to really clean anything, guess again. It is a small noise maker only and does not do what it is supposed to do, but in all fairness, virtually no aircleaners at any price really clean the air of dust, etc. I got in on an Amazon.com special about a year ago and since the price was so low, it has been an excellent investment for my purposes."
5,Great book!,"This is the best book ever written about pediatric neuroimaging, being an essential tool for the neuroradiologist. This new edition includes new technics like spectroscopy and perfusion MR images in a very didatic way.I really recomend this book.Silvio Souto, MD"
4,Fun for toddlers,"My daughter is 2.5 and she thinks this book is hilarious. I guess it's the animals playing tricks on their parents and then their parents scolding them, but she laughs and laughs while we read it. I don't find it that amusing, but since I am not the target audience my opinion doesn't really count. Fun farm animal read."
5,The best c++ design book out there,"Never has a professional/technical book made such an impact on me.I've had this book for many years,but decided to write this review only now because after so many years the pearls of this beautiful masterpiece are unfolding to me. If I love C++ it is because of Andrei Alexandrescu and his amazing book. I only wish that he would write some more books like this. If you find this book to be scary at first and hard to understand, I would like to encourage you to keep on reading and trying. You'll get it eventually and once you do, there is no way back :)"
4,Good book if not for the numerous typos,"I am still learning C++ and this book makes the already difficult task even more difficult. The problem is with the numerous code snippets that contain small typos. For example. on page 137 ""bool destroyed_"" is supposed to be static and the author even says as much in the text but in the code the variable is _not_ declared as static. There are a lot sloppiness in various code examples and conventions are often changed in the code which is couple pages apart. This book requires a new edition which will fix all typos and add new developments in C++ since the book was published.Apart from the above complaint I like the book: it describes pattern that make my life easier designing scientific applications."
5,Fantastic!,"Anyone saying that these techniques are esoteric or useless in normal practice really didn't absorb what the book presents. Essentially, a form of dynamism that's captured at compile time instead of run time, which still lets you write very flexible, abstract code. Only now, there's no efficiency write-off for it. The syntax of it all can be a little hard to get used to, but it _is_ worth it."
2,"Interesting, but pointless","This book describes many intersting C++ things, but is more like a University project than useful for engineer. There are not many things useful or educational for engineer.The author makes column on C++ Users Journal, which is more useful than this book. Author's new book on Coding Standards is also worht buying better than this."
1,Don't bother with this toy,"I ordered 2 sets of this superman and the batman for my grandsons, ages 2 and 3 yrs. As we were opening the package, the hand on each superman fell off. Within 1/2 hr, the cape fell off. I don't blame the distributor but definitely the manufacturer. No little kid is happy with something that falls apart before he gets a chance to play with it."
2,"Good first try, but...","This figure does not hold up very well. It looks decent enough, but it simply is too delicate. The head and hand joints are the most troublesome and are in danger of detaching. There's also the issue of some stiff leg and arm joints (admittedly common in the line) and the fact that there is no hole for a peg, despite the figure being packaged with a stand.If you can get this figure very cheaply or as part of a decent lot then you might want to go for it. Otherwise there is no shortage of better Superman figures out there."
3,"Numeracy lacking, hyped but fun.","Gee did I do something wrong? I once had the number 23 painted on a leather jacket, Bruce says hackers used this number and other fiction from the Illuminati series to inspire their nick names in cyber space. Bruce jealous or an absorbed researcher?So it's true if a simple programmer who gets in trouble, and likes the sex pistols, will be criminalised by capitalist authors who will write books which are fun to read.Nice cover Bruce, are you libel to me?I couldn't finish this book, the section on the grateful dead computer advocate was the last straw, showing the biases in the writing.So while I don't like the implications, it's not bad for education and as a computer security book it was cheap."
1,Aggghhh... This is one brutal read!,"Do you like to listen to people ramble on and on without actually saying a whole lot? If so, this is the book for you.All of the interesting information contained in this ""tome"" could be distilled into about 3 pages. (That's 3 pages of big print).Don't waste your time. There are a dozen other books on similar subjects that are much more interesting and entertaining."
2,BUSTED!,"Think you can't be busted? Well, I used to think that too, butafter reading this, I learned that anything could happen, and you arenever safe. Crackdown is about operation Sun Devil, which occurred in 1990 when the government performed a major crackdown on hackers (hence the name). Remember, know your enemy."
3,Not bad...I guess it depends what you're looking for.,"I bought this book hoping for a little more technical information. Not that I was looking for a ""step-by-step"" hacking manual, but I had hoped to read a little more about the techniques that were used to commit the ""crimes"" and those used to catch them.Having said that, the book was still an interesting read, with plenty of background information. The civil liberties section was particularly interesting, especially when you consider where we are today on that matter; same old questions, even 6 years after this book was published.In short: a tough read, but some interesting facts."
4,Cracking down The Hacker Crackdown,"This book was fairly accurate. I was around the scene during the time of some of these events and found this very interesting. For people with a short attention span, I don't recommend this book, because parts of it go into great detail about how ""The Hacker Crackdown"" was planned and played out. The only inaccuracies I could spot were uses of the word ""hacker"", where in place the term ""cracker"" should've been used."
3,The Book Is Good for early info on telecomunications,The book is good but often tends to linger on. It tells you the info that you want to know. It Is a good sort of info on the start and present state of the telephone industry and will tell you the system workings.He book also tells about bells history on how exactly he invented the telephone
2,Not an exciting book to read.,"The book seems to be written more in the style of a collegethesis than a book for entertainment. It gets a littletedious and boring at times. It has a lot of facts, but thewriting style causes it to be difficult to stay interestedin, causing one to lay it down and go onto something else,instead of wanting to stay with it until finished."
4,A very good read.,"The Hacker Crackdown is a very well researched, nicely written, interesting book (however, one of my non-computer-fanatic friends has politely yawned to me). This book is best defined as a recital of cyberhistory, but the interesting way Mr. Sterling has written it in is clear and easily understood. A slight grumble I have is that the grammar (spelling and sentences) is not 100% correct -- but it is forgivable. The grammar is what has pulled this score down from a 9. So, in a nutshell, this would be called a research project well done. Mr. Sterling, mind taking some time off your sci-fi to research yet another one?"
4,Well worth reading,"I give this a lower # simply because of the pace, but it's worth the read. Good, balanced look at an over-hyped issue--hackers. It attempts to give a balanced view from all sides. But we need to look seriously at government intrusions into our privacy, especially when officials over-hype the criminal threat and use this as leverage for the intrusions. This book is a place for you to start that dialogue. Check out Littman's book on Mitnick too!"
2,A little bit dry,I've read most of the hacker history books and this one reads like a textbook at times. Probably should cut 1/3 out of it to make it flow better.
5,Beautiful music,"This Cd is a must have for anyone interested in Schnittke's music. Not only the presence of the composer during the recording sessions is a guarantee that the works will be performed as intended, but also this disc has a very special performance of the piano sonata n.2 by Irina Schnittke the composer's wife, dedicatee of the work.The piece breathes life as opposed to Berman cold, intellectual rendition.This approach to his piano work reminds me of Svetlana Ponomareva first sonata performance recently released at ponomarevapianist.com.Rostropovich conducting on the English Chamber Orchestra is sensitive while Lubotsky, perhaps not as organically interesting as Kagan delivers a good performance."
3,"Good, but not great","Some of the language and sexuality in the book was not totally necessary and did not add to the overall arc of the story nor did it serve to flesh-out the characters. Also, how many times did I have to read about her tragic experience in China? The setup was too obvious and aside from the final twist at the end, nothing was a surprise. On the positive side, the issues of culture, reality, and perception are all EXTREMELY well developed and explored. Sometimes Mr. Farrell beats you over the head with the message when a simple phrase would do, but all in all, this book was a good, quick read. It took me a little less than a day to finish, but it's been in my head for several days now, which is always a good sign."
3,Decent,"Not a bad book, not a great book. Just decent.The basic idea is a ship full of soldiers and scientists exploring a nearby region of space. The soldiers are predictably aggressive and paranoid, and the scientists are incredibly uninterested in the first contact with an alien culture. (Once they determine that an intelligent species isn't the one they were looking for, they all totally lose interest. Hello?)Unlike many reviewers, I didn't find the ""blues"" especially different from humans. The author tried very hard to make them different, but they're no more alien than the folks in an ethnically different part of town.The book tries to surprise you by setting things up one way and then having them turn out to be something very different. The set up is so clumsy that the end is revealed at the beginning. (Assertions made about a certain phenomenon come to mind.)The plot progressed well, and the main character was well developed. An interesting read, but not a very deep one."
1,nails too soft,"i work with birch and oak.i bought a few of these to compare against the paslode nails. after shooting 10 nails, 1 bent out of the wood, ruining that project. if you bend them, you will see that they are made from softer metal than the higher quality paslode nails.If you are working in the garage on rough carpentry projects, i think that they may be ok. But dont use them for high quality, visiible projects.these are soft like the new porter cable nails. seems like after production was moved to china, they are using cheaper steel.;-(("
5,My baby loves this..,My baby loves to play with this. I wet it and freeze it and it eases her teeth. It is the perfect size for a small dog and made well.
3,Okay but not too durable,"This is a cute toy that my mini poodle puppy loves, but it's not very durable. After only a day with it the stuffing is already starting to peek out :("
3,Puppy Cool Teething Stick,This toy is great for any new puppies going through teething. Too small for larger dogs but just right right for the puppy.
3,not good,i bought this because of the description saying it could be put in the freezer.... ummm it holds a cold temp about as long as any other toy. nothing freezer use about it
5,"Durable and fun, puppy loves it","I didn't think this one can last this long but after a couple of months of abusing, it still stays well and my puppy loves it. She is having fun to untie each knot I always ties, and she carries this one everywhere she goes as it is light and chewable too.I haven't tried the frozen part as I didn't want to make mess and all wet spots when she chews the ice stick.Overall, for the price this toy is totally worth buying for your pups."
5,Puppy Teething Stick,"A GREAT item for the teething puppy, and she likes it even when it's not frozen! But the ability to freeze this and use it as a soothing chew for the teething pup is wonderful."
3,Not a total waste for a crinkle toy,"The toy looks as pictured, and the quality appears to be good enough to hold up through lots of chewing. Parts of the toy crinkle, which distracts my 9 week old for about 60 seconds. Not a total waste of money for a toy but it does nothing for teething puppies. The toy I received does not cool - at all - and the material isn't made for massaging gums/teeth. I recommend a cold wet washcloth and a bully stick over this toy for teething puppies."
3,Loved it - but ate the ribbons,"This was one of my puppy's favorite toys. After about a week though the ribbons are all but gone and she was choking on part of a ribbon and then swallowed it. I cut the remaining frayed ribbons off. I still like the toy, just suggest the ribbons should be made of something more puppy proof."
3,whatever,"it's cheap, frilly, and the material isn't appealing even to a teething cat. I thought my girl would be pouncing this thing to death to chew it and toss around, but she and her sister barely acknowlege it"
4,Cool Teething Stick,"Quick delivery. The teething stick did not stay frozen for long and the puppy lost interest rather quickly. Great concept, but it needs to become, basically, an ice cube."
5,My puppy's favorite!,"My expectations for this item were relatively low but it turns out to be the best thing I've gotten my (now) 10 week old puppy - he loves it!I'm not sure what it is about it that makes it so great for him - the crinkling sound when he chews on it, the coldness/wetness, and the strands that come off it all seem to be a factor - but for a good 10 minutes or longer he'll completely focus on it and that isn't the case with really any of his other toys. Then I'll wet it and throw it in the freezer for later.The big bonus here is that it really seems to calm him down. Almost every time he's gotten a little out of control energy wise and I've given it to him he'll chew it for a while and then lay down to take a nap once he's done. I'm very thankful for that!For the price I'd definitely recommend giving this item a shot for small puppies!"
5,Crinkly noises and long lasting,"My dog loved this toy. And doh!, I didn't even realize it was meant to be frozen. I bought it because the triangle ""fins"" make a crinkly noise my dog loves. We've played tug with the knotted string part and he's chewed whole thing and it has held up. This toy had a long ""shelf life"" both in holding interest and in the materials holding up."
5,Nice,I love how u can freeze this. Although i have not done that yet my puppy loves it. Like i have said about other products from this company it is also the perfect size for my little yorkie. He loves the lil strings on it as well as the spiky things.
3,Doesn't stay frozen,"My puppy is teething and loves ice cubes, so I thought a toy I could freeze would be perfect for him. However, this doesn't seem to freeze at all! It gets cool, but that only lasts for a few minutes out of the freezer. He likes this toy so I'm giving it 3 stars, but I'm pretty disappointed."
1,Very poor quality fabric!,I purchased this toy for my grandpuppy because he loves squeakers. Within two days he had successfully begun shredding the fabric covering to get to the squeakers. He is a 4 mo. mini Schnauzer and only about 7 lb. He has several other fabric squeak toys that have held up very well but I had to throw this one out right away to prevent him from chocking on the broken parts.
1,9 week puppy immediately chewed off nylon ends and ate it,We bought this for our 9 week old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy who weighs 4.5 pounds. Within minutes he had chewed off the nylon ends and was eating them. The other side has string and we've already seen him eat and poop the string! I wouldn't recommend this toy to any serious chewer!
1,Disappointed in this teething toy,I ordered this for my 4 month old Morkie puppy. She is teething now and I thought it would be perfect for her. The size was good but within 10 minutes of having it she had torn off almost all of the ribbons and it was warm to the touch. I returned it and would not recommend this product for any puppy. It would be better if it stayed cold longer and the ribbons were not on it since they are pretty easy to tear off and chew up as my puppy demonstrated.
4,Holds up Well,"My puppy seems to like this toy, and it has held up well. However, it doesn't stay cold very long."
2,Teething stick for SMALL dogs!,"I purchased this toy/teether for my puppy who is 5 months old. She is a large breed. The toy came today as promised, packaging was good, but when I opened it, I realized it is only a few inches long - very small, my dog fit the ENTIRE toy in her mouth at once. It lasted about 15 minutes and she had it ripped to pieces. Not very durable at all."
5,Puppy's Favorite,This is one of our puppy's favorite toys and it was also one of the cheapest so you can't really go wrong. She loves to work on each little tab or ribbon and take the knots out of them. It's pretty beat up but still hanging in there. We'll get another one when she destroys it.
3,Not So Coo,My puppy loves this toy but I've found that the toy doesn't get very cold after leaving it in the freezer overnight. It also doesn't stay cold for very long.
3,Disappointed,"Very small and doesn't stay cold for very long at all. Most baby teething rings stay cold longer than this. My Lab loves toys and she didn't really take much interest in this. Oh well, glad it wasn't very pricey."
5,Puppies love this!,I bought this toy as a recommended set of 3 teething toys and boy what a great teething stick for puppies. The size and types of teething pieces are perfect for small puppies teeth; they can grab hold and really get some relief. The shape of the toy is also nice for puppies - they can either hold it horizontally or vertically by themselves easily.
1,Nothing specia; Poor quality and would not recommend. TINY too,"When I saw and read the description, I envisioned something similar to what we toss in freezer for babies. It's just a patchwork sewn flimsy, cloth item with a slight crinkle noise. The cool teething aspect is to wet the cloth exterior and wring out water, then freeze. You can do that with anything. Puppy used it once for about 2 minutes and bit little cloth legs off and ate them. I was able to fish a small piece out his mouth when I realized the toy was ""edible."" This is poor advertisement; poor quality; and definitely not durable enough to be considered appropriate for puppy chewing. Maybe a puppy with dental problems, who will never get the tiniest of teeth. Puppy is 7 1/2 weeks old. Not at all what I envisioned Oh, wow, he just pooped yellow, red and blue. Ugh!"
2,Noops...,I have 19 week old GR pup and in less than 4 hrs he manages to rip apart this product....may differ from dog to dog but i will not buy this product again...
3,other reviewers make me worried.,"Length:: 0:27 Minsother reviews make me skeptical, but I've owned this for a few months and haven't had any ripping. On average, I only watch this puppy 1 day a week for a friend. The puppy usually plays with it more when the toy has been placed in the freezer. I think there are more fun toys out there, although this toy was designed first and foremost for teething. The puppy usually plays with the toy 30 seconds at a time, for maybe 5 to 10 times an hour. When the toy warms up to room temperature, the puppy usually doesn't play with the teething tool as often. My friends puppy can't type, so I'll just have to type what I see. If you give this review a thumbs down, I'm going to tell the puppy that you're a meanie."
2,Teething dog toy,"I had great hopes that this would soothe and ease my dog's mouth while he is teething. I have been disappointed, for it wasn't sturdy enough for him. I think for a very small dog, it would work. My dog tore it up right away!"
3,Could be better...,I agree with the review that this is a great idea but no matter how much you wet the toy it does not freeze completely. It would be perfect if it stayed frozen longer. My puppies are excited when I take the toys from the freezer but after a minute or so that excitement wears off because now all they have it a wet soft toy.
2,suitable for smaller dogs,"I got this for 5 month old Border Collie pup. It freezes well but de-frosts very fast, lasting only few minutes. May be suitable for smaller dogs. The fabric seems flimsy & toy fragile."
2,not sturdy,My 3 month old puppy loves to chew but doesn't tear up her toys easily (actually hasn't broken any toy before...) This toy was a big hit with her - she loves the texture and coolness but she had pieces torn off and eaten in the first 5 minutes. I am very dissapointed because I was hoping I'd found a new bunch of toys for her.
2,"Small and not durable, ribbons will break off/get swallowed","This toy was a lot smaller than I anticipated especially with its high price. In its 4th day of use, my puppy tore off one of the dangling ribbons and started chewing on it. Luckily I was there to intercept it. Do yourself a favor and just get kong toys... they dont break."
1,Choking hazard,"Not recommended for puppies. My 3 month old puppy swallowed it after playing with it for 3 minutes. Thank God I was able to make her throw it up. Major choking hazard. I never leave her alone with any of her toys, but this one she got away from me and had it down in 3 seconds."
1,Not a dog toy,This teething stick is made of cheap nylon. My puppy began eating it at once. I will not buy any Petstages products as they do not delivery what they promise.
1,Awful,"When I received this item it was not what I expected. The toy was small, cheap and it tore on me within a week. It was NOT worth my money!!!"
2,too big and heavy,"Recieved it as a gift. Too heavy and big to be portable. I am shopping for something more portable right now. It could be ok for around the backyard, but to big and bulky to pack around.I decided not to ""take it"".k. Johnson"
4,Very good stuff,"This guide constitutes an excellent effort in describing major artists in different music genres.But I found certain omissions, for example in Dave Brubeck an album is mentioned Time Changes but there is no review of it at all.In Easy Listening I didn't found Roger Whittaker who has been praised with a special edition of Billboard magazine several years ago.Another one is Claudine Longet which had several records of her own.Anyway this guide is a must for any music fan."
3,Disappointing,"I was looking for a guide to recent rock recordings. This was not it. Most of the groups I looked up weren't listed (P.O.D., Incubus, et. al.). You'd be better off just going to their website or reading reviews on amazon."
1,Didn't work for me,"I ordered one of these, but it didn't read SD cards on my PowerBook G4. Amazon replaced it with another, and that didn't read SD cards either. Both read CF cards, and illumiate the SD LED when I insert the card, so there's something seriously wrong."
5,Works Great!,Didn't have to load any drivers or install any software with Windows XP. Reads different types of cards well. Highly recommended for Windows XP users.
3,some good some bad,"Perhaps I would give this book a 5, but since the subject is a language, I must say that the transcription is bad and unconsistent, even considering William's not so modern English pronunciation. So, as a manual, it's pretty useless (in spite of what it say in the introduction); for comparative purposes - it doesn't need my recomendation; it is also an interesting early description of Native life and customs, as well as an interesting example of a 17th century language manual though rather hastily written."
3,This is a fairly good book for learning the Spanish language,"Puntos de Partida is a good book, if you would like to learn more than just Spanish vocabulary. This book is a good tool for the learning the fundamentals of the Spanish language."
1,"hard to install, imposible to uninstall","This product is not very good. I gives you a lot of problems when you intall it, and It keeps demanding to renew the license, even thoug you do not want it. it absoutly get you more problems than what it solves"
1,I wanted to give it a zero,"All it is is spywear and all its wants to do is uninstall all my other protection, Like the Firewall. I got the technical help and I knew more than them. Don't waste your money."
3,More Mystery than Romance,"Ms Wolf's writing was excellent as usually, but I found the novel a little lacking the romance category. I also found the heroine Cathleen to be silly and very immature. Cathleen is forced into a marriage with Adrian the Earl of Greystone by Cathleen's sinister uncle Lord Charlwood. Soon after the wedding, Adrian is called to Paris to help the Duke of Wellington, and Harry (the Earl's younger brother) appears on the scene. Kate and Harry hit it off right away and soon they become bosom buddies. They have a grand time searching for a missing groom, gathering clues, and hunting down and confronting a murder. Adrian appears sporadically through the story, but he is never included in the action. I think the story would have been more ""romantic"" if Adrian had been the one to solve the mystery rather than his brother Harry."
5,Wow--what a great read!,"At first it felt weird for me to read a romance told in the first person, but once I got into the story, I couldn't put it down. The characters, the plot, the setting were wonderful. I enjoyed reading about horses and I fell in love with the narrating voice of the heroine. It was not as hot as I would have liked, but the romance was so good that it didn't matter.I already bought another book by this author and can't wait to read it."
1,Do not buy this,"This mp3 player sucks! Two weeks after I bought it the hardware broke and is unable to be fixed.The buslink support is non exsitent. So if it breaks there is nothing you can do. Stick to Sony, Phillips or Rio thoes are ligit."
4,Good little MP3 player - good value for the memory,"I had intended to purchase the iPod until I saw the price <yikes> and also read several reviews that left me doubting whether that was the right player for me. This is my first MP3 player - I wanted something small I could take to the gym. My biggest concern was NOT that it hold hour after hour of music because I knew I could delete files and replace as I wanted. After reading the reviews on this player I decided to go for it. I'm not disappointed. I'm running Windows XP and the device was recognized immediately - all necessary drivers were automatically installed. Within 5 minutes I had transferred 20 MP3's into the unit and was playing with the various functions. Nice size - 256MB which is more than enough for me :) I'm glad I didn't spend the money on the iPod....this one suits me just fine. The ear buds actually stay in my ears, although I still find them annoying and will probably invest in a small set of headphones to replace them."
1,Don't buy it!!!,This thing is extremely unreliable.Mine is broken in less than 2 month!!!Don't bother to thinking about it!!!
2,I would pay a little extra to get an MP3 player that lasts,It holds lots of songs and has good sound quality...if it stays working. It's very cheaply made an mine broke within several months after buying it. I would pay a little extra money and go for a higher quality MP3 player. Also the BUSlink company is not very helpful.
2,DON'T BUY IT!,"I bought the Buslink 256MB MP3 player because I thought I'd found a bargain since it was far cheaper than all the other 256MB MP3 players. Don't be fooled! Mine completely broke in less than three months. Right after I bought it the plastic ""shell"" on the outside popped off. Then later the entire player broke. The screen would freeze anytime I tried to turn it on. All in all, it is very cheaply made and the Buslink customer support is virtually nonexistant, so I would shell out an extra $20 or $30 to get a name brand Mp3 player that will last!"
2,Won't work under Mac OS X 10.3!,"I bought one of these things because it said it was Mac OS X compatible, but it's not compatible with the latest version: 10.3. I called Buslink and talked to their Mac guy there (who was very kind and apologetic, by the way) and he said to send it back. It works really well under OS 9 (I believe it even works under 10.2 though I didn't test it), and it's a nice little player, but as of right now it won't work in 10.3. I asked if there was any possibility of a firmware update or anything that would fix this problem and he said no. He said it's possible that future generations of these will work in 10.3, but it's probably best to give Buslink a call to check before buying one!"
4,The Big Easy is under attack.,This is the third edition in the MASH Goes To series. The heartland of Jazz will never be the same!
3,A witty hors d'oeurve!,"A survey of the most famous sea serpent/monster sightings. Serious marine cryptozoologists will find it frustratingly lean, but it would make perfect bedside reading at the beach house. Overall, a cleverly written, entertaining read."
2,"It's an OK read, but not spectacular","This isn't a bad book, but there are better ones of this genre. Some of the stories are quite interesting; others, less so. Some could use more detail, more background research. According to the book, the author has taken up writing full time. You could have fooled me. This book appears to be written as a hobby, by someone who has occupational interests other than writing. But, some of the book is well documented, and overall the book is OK."
4,Good book,"I liked it a good read, if you like this sort of thing, adventure and such. I would recommend it."
5,wow...,"its bands like the casualties that give hope that punk is alive and well. I love this band, the music is awesome, if you like the casualties, or if you are into punk, or just want to hear a good cd, then check this one out"
5,INSANE!!!!!!,"this cd is amazing for any casualties fan. hearing jorge scream in spanish makes him sound a million times crazier. alzo, the idea that a well known band would put something so meanigful together for the fans, makes it that much cooler. this band and this cd is AWESOME!!!"
1,poopoo poopy doodoo caacaa aka the casualties,"H a n d s d o w n the most cliche cd i have ever heard. when will it end!!! i read some little dumbarse say that ""the casualties are punk and i should know because im punk"", oh please you little doche, that kid sounds like this one girl at my school that wears good charolette shirts with The Casualties pinned all over it... face it they stood for something a long time ago, but punks dead as phukk. This cd is so comsumer friendly and sooooo bbboooorrriiinnnggg!!! INDK AND CRACK ROCK STEADY LIVES ON!!!!"
1,retarded thing ever made,your not punk if you consider yourselve punk nin the friggen first place. you dont need any of these stupid mohawks of anything to even be punk. this is one of the stupidest overated things ever made
1,THIS IS NOT PUNK!

5,Fernando Cabral,"There is something about Lenine's music that makes you feel as though it is actually taking you to a place you've never been before. A magical place only he knows about. His music is the key to this world.He uses the poetry, the rhythms, the pulse of the various beats and his undeniable unique way to play the guitar to talk about the human condition and the unending search for the beatiful.Sometimes music can actually be an artform. Something with a purpose crafted by an genuine artist. It is certainly the case here."
5,Muito Bacana,"This is a great CD if you are not already a Lenine fan (or even if you are) - a compilation of previously released songs remastered and packaged for a North American release. This guy is a global superstar. I really hate how we are told in the U.S. that we don't like music that isn't in English. Baloney! We miss out on so much, and Lenine is one you should not miss."
5,Listen to This Guy!,"Lenine is a remarkable artist. Singer, songwriter and one outstanding guitarist. His work is well known in Brazil but almost completely unknown elsewhere. This is a travesty. If he wrote and sang in English he would be an international star.Take some time to listen to this compilation of songs from some of his earlier CDs (not released in the US). Lavadeira do Rio (Laundrywoman of Rio) has been covered by many other Brazilian artists, as has Jack Soul Brasileiro, but none of those versions measure up to Lenine's own interpretations.Give this CD a try. Then check out his live Cit CD."
4,"A great ""best of""","This cd is a collection of Lenine's greatest hits. A must for any Lenine enthusiasts. A great mix of pop, rock and traditional brazilian percussive music."
1,statistical nonsense,"Dr. Strosahl alleges that hospitalization does not reduce the incidence of suicide ands offers statistical proof that the incidence of suicide is greater in psychiatric hospitals than it it is outside of psychiatric hospitals. By this logic all cancer wards should be cleared since the death rates from cancer are substantially highter in hospitals than they are in the population at large. Dr. Strosahl also writes that mental health professionals should never be held to have met the test of foreseeability for a patients suicide after taking into consideration all of the patients risk factors. That begs the question, Why bother doing a patient suicide risk assessment at all?"
2,Confusing at first but I caught on. Then I liked it.,"I liked the book and all, but I never would've understood it if my teacher wouldn't have explained it. I had to read a passage repeatedly to understand it fully. After a couple of the first chapters, I didn't need my teachers help of explaining the word use. That was last year in grade 8. If the teacher didn't assign the book to read. I probably would've gaven up in the beginning. The descriptions of the planet were interesting but hard to understand. I don't mean to offend anyone in this passage, because overall it was a good book."
1,Come on!! Does science fiction get any more pathetic?,"Very simply one of the worst books I have ever read--and I've read a lot of books. Where should I start? It's full of unnecessary details--like that plants have silver leaves--and I hated all the characters. One character called Guardian, the author keeps hinting that he is a robot but never comes right out and says it until the end. There's a lot more to hate about it too. Read it only as a last resort. I am 14. I only read it because it was recommended to me and the sequel looked like it might be better. I haven't read the sequel yet."
3,Premier not worth it; stick with Deluxe,"I've been using TurboTax for many years. Until now, I've always used TurboTax Deluxe for the free state download. This year, I decided to try TurboTax Premier for the ""Tax-Slashing Tools"".I don't think the Premier features (over ""Deluxe"") are worth the extra cost. What you get is a bunch of very basic tax advice related to sale of equity investments, use of IRAs, and contributions to 401(k) accounts (""contribute as much as you can""). It also contains some stuff related to rental properties, but I don't own any real estate, so it doesn't apply to me.I will be sticking with Deluxe from now on. Maybe if I buy a house I'll try out Premier in the future, but not until then.I have tried TaxCut (2000 or 2001, I don't remember), but I didn't like it compared with my previous use of TurboTax. So until TurboTax changes for the worse, I don't plan to try TaxCut again."
2,Not as good as last year's,"I was very happy with last year's version for 2002 tax returns. I own rental property and using TT helped guide me through depreciations and other considerations that I had done differently on my own. This year's edition of TT has become confusing and even completely passes over the deductions for automobile use. I've read a couple dozen of the many reviews for the Deluxe version and the same problems exist here. You'll have to download a fairly large update and you'll likely have problems with fonts. I realize the tax code has changed dramatically, but that doesn't let Intuit off the hook. Read the reviews of the Deluxe version and you'll likely be scared away."
1,Last minute buyers should avoid,TurboTax Premier would not install on my XP system. It just hung during the part where fonts are installed. This bug is known to tech support but nothing they told me or sent me worked. Getting help was arduous. I'm going back to TaxCut.
1,his late brother's baby.....,Ethan Carvelle broke up with Mia Stewart yrs ago. She's back claiming his late brother the father of her unborn child. Ethan decides he'll take Mia as his mistress but never as his wife. I didn't enjoy reading this book right from the beginning & wouldn't recommend it. If you want romance this is not a book for you.
1,Boring,I found it boring. Not your typical romance. The hero is mean to the heroine a couple of times and he is a jerk...not so much a hero in my opinion.
4,A Different kind of Love story.,"This was definately a different kind of love story. Some of the usual plots used by Harliquin writers but Carol Marinelli gives them abit of a twist.I don't want to give any of the story away, though I believe most readers will of course figure it all out in the first few chapters. But its a story about forgiveness and finding love. Its also about two polar opposites finding each other.As I said this is a different kind of love story one that I think incorporates many of the things that are going on today. If you are looking for a traditional love story this is proably not the one for you. But if you are looking for something new and alittle different with a modern theme then give this one a read."
1,Poor quality,You get what you pay for. I tried these and was very disappointed at the quality. All were warped and touched the DVD surface and the clear outer cover was poorly attached to the case. Not a case I would put any of my DVDs into.
1,Quality even less than I expected for $27.00,"The review process did not allow me to pick my number of stars this time; instead it asked me how much fun the toy was, educational, durable, overall, with stars for each of those specifics.... obviously listed strangely.I'd give it 2 stars, I guess, if I could. Only because I didn't expect much, and I got about what I expected--maybe less. Very, very, very cheaply made product. So cheaply made that many of the dvd holders, although new, are splitting/ripping, or simply DEFECTIVE. I expected cheap, but probably wouldn't have bought them if I'd been able to SEE the quality beforehand.Okay enough to keep and simply toss the bad ones, but wouldn't buy again."
2,Low Quality (Even for a Piece of Plastic!),"I would not buy this again and don't recommend it. Overall the case is fine, albeit on the cheap side, but there is ONE big issue... the plastic ""film"" that goes around the outside is very thin and not durable at all. We're going us these 100, but we will not use this vendor again."
1,Not Worth the Purchase,I burn DVDs and needed cases for them. These have been almost 20% useless - you can't slide any papers under the clips on the inside of the case because then the little plastic pieces that hold them closed break and the case won't latch. About 1 in every 5 does that anyway. Get something a little sturdier!
5,An ideal DVD case purchased through AMAZON,An ideal DVD case. Securely holds and protects your DVD. Provision for identification on the front and side (for storage on a shelf) as well as for a description on the back. I recommend these as a good investment for DVD storage. I will be purchasing again in the future.
2,the smell of the covers makes you sick!,"Sorry, but the DVD covers are not ""exceptional quality"" as stated in the description.The plastic is attached in a very simple and cheap way and does not look professional.When we got the carton and opened it, the smell of the covers made us physically sick ...we left the open carton in our office but had to remove it because we could not stand the smell!The locking mechanism seems ok, but they don't show or write that when you put a DVD or CD into thecover you almost tear the plastic cover on the back because of the way it is constructed.Many of our covers have dents now ...If you want a lot for a little money, here you go ... but if you prefer a little quality, go for something else!"
3,it's okay,"But the more you use it, it finally breaks or cracks in the seams of the hard plastic. Only the plastic film on the outside continues to hold it together to some extent. Sad to say, I still haven't found a decent one at a reasonable price that holds up under much use."
3,Good for price but overall only ok.,These are good for the price but they are a little flimsy. But at about 20 cents a piece they are worth the price.
3,School book,"I purchased this book for school, it was a decent read, great for gathering some highlights and topic awareness gathering purposes."
5,Great,These are great if your into hunting arrowheads. For different stones you should use different color materials to make them standout.
1,Cheap,did not like this sheet. May be my fault but it did not fit 5 inch mattress. I had to buy another sheet
5,Fits Graco Pack N Play perfectly,"I use this for our Graco Pack N Play and it fits perfectly. It is extremely soft, I ordered another one!"
4,Good pack-n-play sheet,"This sheet is soft. Fits our Graco pack-n-play. I haven't tried other brands, so I can't compare the quality, but this one seems to be good."
2,"Better than the videotape, but not by much","This 1978 movie, filmed on the Isle of Man, has heretofore only been available as a dark, murky, fuzzy, hard-to-see movie on VHS tape. With this DVD release, we now have a dark, murky, fuzzy, hard-to-see movie on DVD.In all fairness, I have to say that the DVD is an improvement over the VHS tape. But it's not much of an improvement. The DVD producers should have remastered the DVD from the original negatives. Alas, they did not.It could have been so much better."
2,"Yes, this is horrible.","I agree with other reviewers. It looks like someone copied--I mean literally copied from a videocasette! I didn't even realize Nagel was wearing his famous ""loud yellow suit"" until someone in the ""movie"" pointed it out, that's how muddy it is. His suit looked brown to me. The voiceover actors are horrible, but even if the quality were decent, the editing, overly-loud music, pacing, it's all just a mess. What a shame because the book it's taken from is my favorite of all time. ""Would that thy knife were as sharp as your final no.""""What rubbish!"""
4,mysteries,good old movie not as good as some of rutger hauer movies but bought it to add to my growing collection of rutger hauer films
1,"ditto, broke immediately","I bought this knowing the previous reviewer had said it broke immediately, and although I was very careful the very sharp blade still snapped right off and went flying toward my face. You don't need this tool to cut the shades, and your much safer using a more sturdy knife instead."
3,Works but unnecessary,The Redi Shade Shade Triming Tool does work but not any better that a utility knife so why bother to buy it?
1,cheap item,"droke in less than 10 seconds, used a kitchen knife worked just as well dont waste your money"
1,Not necessary ... kitchen knife would have worked as well or better,"This is a cheap knife with a short blade and non-user friendly handle. It did not work any better than an average kitchen knife. If it had come with a bracket or some sort of brace to steady the shade and help protect you fingers and cutting surface, it would have been worth purchasing. A sharp heavy duty kitchen knife would have done a better job. Cannot recommend this as is.Redi Shade 1616204 Original Pleated White Paper Shade 36-by-72-Inch, 6-Pack"
1,Dull cutter,This was a waste of money. The triming tool is too dull...after cutting one shade it was rendered useless.
1,Knife,"Worthless,blade snapped first thing. Can use a kitchen knife just as well. Be careful and use cardboard under shade or cutting board. I like to use cardboard on nailed down rug. Can get more weight on cutting. Don't over force it !"
1,Summer Interns,"Seriously? You are considering buying a knife made from a blinds manufacturer just because it was the ""approved blinds shortening tool?"" Do you also follow the directions on your shampoo that say ""For best results, use XXXXX conditioner, body wash, skin cream, make-up line and boots?"" Do you actually believe that a group of engineers designed this tool with a 100-page test plan, complete with a section titled ""Design optimization results?"" More likely it was an undergraduate summer-intern project at Redi Shade, for all departments from engineering to marketing. Seriously - who interns at Redi Shade? People who like knives, apparently. I guess I'd rather it be Redi Shade than law enforcement.On second thought... you probably should buy this."
5,Sutton has created a collage of insight and understanding.,"After reading Love Matters I was ready and willing to take a deeper look at all aspects of all of my relationships, and I am a heterosexual! Sutton has gone deep into her life work, exposing all aspects of her relationships. I have great respect for Sutton, and her partner Maureen, for taking the risk in the hopes of opening the hearts of lesbians and all others who want more fulfilling relationships. It has been a long time since I have even read a ""relationship"" book cover to cover- I couldn't put this one down! Thank you, Ms. Sutton, for the funny, insightful book. Consider your advice taken."
2,Below Average.,"As stated by the person that posted up a review before me, mojoplay is not the exact one that people would want. something about it just doesnt make me want to keep playing it on this monitor. blurry, fuzzy, nothing clear about it at all.I really wish Amazon would carry Joytech's LCD screen. i would buy that in a heartbeat, even if it costs 40 dollars more. but since amazon doesnt carry it, im gonna have to buy it from a different carrier.if anyone's looking for an LCD screen for the PS2 slim version, this is not the one for you. spend the extra $40 to get the Joytech version. it really is that much better."
3,A better recommendation,"I must confess that I have not tried this Item. BUT, for the price and quality, I recommend the Pelican 7"" Game Glass. I bought it first, despite negative reviews and... well I'm taking well of it aren't I?-Its less expensive-lightweight-Slim-easy to find online.Cons:-Screen AV cord does not allow simultaneous viewing with TV you must remove and plug in standard PS2 AV cord.-small size text distortion***I just now looked and saw a BONUS PACK that comes with a car adaptor and a carry case here on Amazon.***Now for Quality and Features. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Joytech 8"" LCD monitor!!!This thing is awesome for your slim PS2:-looks nice-car adaptor-remote control that gives full DVD control AND resets, turn on/off THE PS2!(I found this out myself, haven't seen this mentioned anywhere)-best picture quality-great soundCons: (Im nit-picking here)-bulkier-heavier-expensive-not too easy to find online in the US mostly in the UK."
3,It Lingers On My Mind !,"Mr. Graham really possesses a gutsy candor and honesty which is both intriguing and unsettling. Even though many of the situations, conversations, and characters presented in his book seem one dimensional and stereotypical, there is something there that lingers in my mind. The gestalt has the ring of truth which hits home, (and I'm not even african american !). Insidious racism in genteel surroundings is somehow even scarier than the in your face brand. Keep up the good work Mr. Graham, we need to know what's going on."
5,"Insightful, entertaining, and well-written","Lawrence Otis Graham touches on many issues that African-Americans who were raised in similar backgrounds can identify with. Although I did not agree with everything he said, I did find his work an enjoyable and easy read. I highly recommend it."
2,BALONEY!,"There is one point that is neglected throughout this book. Being black is a birth condition and not an issue of membership. All the clubs and offers in the world does not make one black. Being black is a state of birth.The author appears to be racked with insecurities. This tedious dissertation is little more than a fox crying about his sour grapes by saying he didn't want membership to exclusively white clubs to begin with. Not very convincing, Mr. Graham. What was the point of that long, drawn out account of his nose job? If he was trying to change the appearance of his nose for racial reasons, then the man has identity as well as self acceptance issues. I think this book is just a big excuse for the author to cry in his beer and flaunt his self pity."
2,Not a member -boo hoo- an other complaints,"How come someone as educated as mr. graham endeavors to write a book on a subject that any high school sophomore could have done, maybe better, what purpose did it serve. Any nonmember with an IQ of sixty or above knows pretty much all that is talked about in this book...its no revelation. mr graham goes undercover as a bus boy at an exclusive club, gets treated like what is to be expected then he is shocked and writes about the results...., or is he. He should stop waisting time and buy his way into the club, then not drain our intellectual capacity with mindless research and rehashed social talk. Ok, only purchase if your head is in the sand or you failed to enlighten your kids before they left the nest."
5,This is the Book to Put NT Translators Out of Business,"For people with autism/Asperger's, this book is the book to have in understanding colloquialisms, idioms and metaphors. Instead of relying on neurotypical (NT) counterparts to interpret and translate these phrases, just keep this book handy. It's the ideal tool to have when learning the language of the NT world."
2,"""Theres One Born Every Minute""","As I started to get into the book, my constant thought was ""How can this woman be SO stupid"" Mirmiam was a pretty bright woman with her whole future in front of her and she ruined her youth and looks by joining a ""clut"" who used woman and humilated and degraded them. I kept skipping pages to see when she would please ""smarten up"". Having five children was very irresponsible when she could not even handle her own life. I was glad she finally wised up and left. If any good will come of this book, I hope young women will take heed and never let this happen to them. Hopefully women of today are brighter. I do feel for Miriam through, with that face she could of gone so far. A depressing book, but at least the end showed some promise for her family."
4,"enlightning, fascinating, troubling","This is a fascinating and sad account of the author's journey from being a rebellious teenage intellectual to being caught up in a suffocating cult. The pseudo-Christian organization, known as ""The Children of God"" claimed 20,000 adherents at it's peak. The book details her slow realization of the web of deception and depravity that ensnarl her and describes her journey back to a life of appropriate human relationships.Semantic snapshots include the rebuke she received from cult leaders for the sin of having a difficult labor and delivery; her cult directed descent into ""flirty fishing"", perhaps better described as ""hooking for Jesus"", and the bizarre manner of the cults leader and founder, ""Mo"" David.David lead the cult from it's founding in the mid-60's until his death in 1994. From the book I can only conclude that the reason he did not die at a younger age was the time it took to construct a special place for him in h! ell."
3,Slow start to a good children's series,"First off, I must admit that it has been many years since I last read this book, however I do have a relatively good memory of it.Basic plot: Gom is a mousy haired boy living with his lumberjack father, Zig (I think) in the mountains, his mother being a wizard who disappeared at his birth and has never been seen since. Most of the book revolves around Gom's everyday life and his strange affinity with the world around him, until near the end of the book he gets drawn into an adventure that will send him off to learn magic and find his mother later in the series.For a typical imaginative child, if they can get through this book, I think they will very much enjoy the rest of the series, I know that I did."
3,Good and Bad,"The ladder itself looks great, however, the company it is shipped from had to resend us a ladder as the original never arrived. The one that did arrive was bent during shipping so while it works, it is not as good as it could be."
3,Step stool,"I ordered this because it said it could be used as a chair as well as a ladder but the height is too low to use as a chair, overall quality was fine. I just found the description misleading."
1,Warning - Cannot Be Played w/ PC,"1 Star for Hurting Consumers' Rights...This BMG import has a copy protection notice saying it is only compatible with ""home audio"" cd players, and less than 100% of other types of audio players. Additionally the label says it only plays degraded quality on Windows machines and not at all on Macs. The URL on the notice is www.bmg-copycontrol.info, which says their sales declined 2% and this will save them.The copy protection looks like CDS-200 which installs the Midbar (recently bought by Macrovision) player onto your PC. There is an uninstaller on the CD, but your best option under XP if you accidentally allowed this to autoinstall is to do a system rollback to the previous system checkpoint.Considering the genre of music, most USA users purchasing this are likely to want to play it on a portable music device. Be advised that the ""defaults"" on Exact Audio Copy and Easy CD-DA won't help."
3,meh!,well this cd is all ok and and all but the only song I really like is Dragonsta Tin Dein which is the coolest cuz its so funny but worst when u put it into french so what ever u do litsen to the original its better...
1,:-((((,Oh my god! How possibly can you listen to this junk? This is surely the biggest rubbish of the year. No doubt.
3,"Nice, but a Disappointment","A very nice idea with soft, sweet illustrations of a beloved child. It is a little disappointing that the text seems to lack the emotional investment necessary to make what could have been a special book."
5,Servicio para los que van a encarnar,"Así como el Arcángel Miguel asiste a los que desencarnar, la Madre María se encarga de los que van a tomar la encarnación. Eso es lo que descubrí estudiando este libro. De hecho, hasta antes de hacerlo, sólo conocía la actividad de la Madre María con el Maestro Ascendido Jesús.Sin embargo, en este Libro se devela todo el inmenso servicio que Ella presta en el Templo del Sagrado Corazón a las corrientes de vida que se preparan para encarnar.En este sentido, aparecen aquí magnos decretos que se pueden emitir a favor de la purificación del karma de los que van a encarnar, tal como señalan, en otros Libros, los demás Maestros Ascendidos y Seres de Luz."
4,"A concise, engaging description of important CC-problems","Every critical care resident wishes to solve clinical problems which do not happen every day. He wishes to solve these problems in a way the patient profits from and in reality he often wishes to have sufficient time to do so. This excellent book indeed has all the stuff to please the residents needs: Fascinating problems, easy to read and helpful advice on improving your clinical skills"
2,A struggle,"I didn't find this book nearly as useful as some of the others I have read. In some sense, this is in part due to the writing style and approach used. I would recommend Gunsalus myself as essential read."
5,Lots of fun - highly recommend it!,"If you liked the movie ""The Grifters"" or ""House of Cards"", this book is your cup of tea."
4,"Holds Your Intrest, Looses it at the End","Most of this book, is fast-paced, and really holds your attention. I like the set-up and the ultimate con, how things fall into place and how the characters are able to change course if things do not proceed exactly as planned. But, the last few chapters sort of fall apart. I really didn't enjoy the ending as much as the rest of the book. It just seemed that the plot took some unlikely turns, that I didn't see as realistic."
4,It made me want to join in the fun of the Con!,What a wondefully fun book! I haven't read a lot of this genre of book and King Con was a nice first introduction into it. I listened to the audio book version and the reader really added to the experience - they found the perfect voice. The sense of humor that ran through the book (even with the bad guys) was great. I am now looking for more Cannell books to listen to or to read. You will not be disappointed if you're looking for a fun adventure!
4,King Con is a winner,"If you want a chance to look into the world of gambling, finance and money laundering, this one's for you."
1,Cliched hack work without a single graceful quality,"I only looked up the reviews for this book to enjoy seeing others dump deserved scorn on this book. Imagine my suprise when everybody loved it. My initial thought on this book, besides thinking every plot twist was stolen and unartfully retold, was that this book should be a great boost for aspiring novelists - the bar is not as quite as high as you thought. Now I don't pick up a crime/thriller book for literature, but I do expect a little wit and originality. I remembered the Rockford files as having at least a little of these. This book does not. I plan to pick up this book again - maybe I am the one who is crazy - but I could not believe the estatic reviews."
5,Great book!,My second read of Cannell's work. Very compelling. I read this book in a week. I can't wait to get into the Scully series.
4,This is a great look into the world of grifters!!,"I picked up the book because of his name, Stephen J Cannell. I loved his shows and figured his novels had to be of the same quality. I was wrong...this is so much better. This novel is unique (to me anyway) because of the lingo the grifters use: it's real!! But at the same time, he doesn't let them talk down to the readers, the terms are explained. I highly recommend this book!!"
1,"Defective product from Stacks and Stacks, will not take back",This shoe cabinet took me 3 hours to assemble. The moment 2 pairs of women's shoes were placed in the cubby the door fell off. Very badly constructed. Do not buy. The retailer would not stand behind the product. (They did send a replacement which fell apart in the exact same place.) Do not buy from the retailer Stacks and Stacks. They do not care if you are a satisfied customer or not.
1,Dont waste your time or money,"Been looking for a shoe cabinet. Found this online. Picture shown is 2 of them stacked. Fooled me to think it was 1 item. Box came crushed and with water damage. Packing slip is charging me more for item then items worth plus s&amp;h..? Unpacked item, pieces are not marked, instuctions are poor. Sides are cheap plastic that the wood sort of just sits in. Put together anyway. No surprise. Corners are cracked and chipped door wont even close because its warped. Thought I would put it together to see if I should get an undamaged cabinet reshipped. NO THANKS. Shelves are all a different size. WONT fit a thing but sandles and flats. No tennis shoes. No mens shoes. Also there is no back on cabinet so shoes will get ditry and dusty. Defeats the purpose of a drawer. What a waste of money. Target does not refund S&H either. OUCH"
1,GARBAGE,"I bought this product, it fell apart. After fixing it multiple times, I finally exchanged it. The second one fell apart too. The problem is that the door hinge does not stay screwed in on one side (same problem both times) and then the door falls inside the cabinet. The shoe-weight inside make this cabinet a total pain to fix. Also, if you have shoes bigger than ballet slippers, the middle shelf is useless. Save your money and pass this one up."
1,Don't let the looks fool you...,"This product only took one day to require fixing. Also, if you need to store high heels, you should look for a different shoe rack. You get what you pay for..."
5,Shoe Cabinet,I've had one for about 2 years and absolutely love no longer seeing the shoe clutter by the door. []
2,No quality,"Very poor quality. Was not difficult to assemble but the ""hardware"" that the pull out slides on is PLASTIC. (no wonder the box has a few replacements. But I prefer to put things together ONCE, rather than having to constantly repair a shoddy product)The mechanism unaligned about the third time I opened it to take out shoes. I recommend spending the extra money on a product with quality construction."
1,GARBAGE,"First of all your picture shows large unit. I have received half of it. This is simply the false advertisment. When I complained about to the vendor(Organizeit) I was told that is what I have ordered. No, it is not. I have placed my order based on picture that shows large unit not the half it. Unit itself is a piece of garbage. If you have handy $80(cost and shipping) you better off giving it to charity. The instruction is very unclear. There are some holes that are predrilled and it shoud not be. On the other hand some holes that should be there do not exist. And there is return policy. Very convienient but for the Orgenizeit. If you want to return this ""piece of art"" you have to spend additional money from your own pocket. And they might charge you restocking fee. So the battom line is that you spend around $100 and receive back maybe $20 or $30. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY.JACEK"
5,Best Shoe Storage Ever,"Your shoe cabinet is the best shoe storage solution I have found for women's shoes. I have one and am trying to find another one or two locally. The local Target store no longer carries it! Because of the weight, shipping costs are prohibitive for ordering online. Does any Target store near zip code 22026 carry this? Local Target rep on phone told me that they had several, but when I went to the store, they could not find any."
5,The Fishin Guy,"This product is excellent,right on,can't beat the price ! It was delivered in a record time and well packed also.Will definetly purchase this product in the future and different size nails as well.Thanks a bunch Amazon---- T.A. Tools"
4,Worth a watch,Would recommend this movie if you are a fan of shark movies like Jaws & Deep Blue Sea. It will never win any awards but is very enjoyable for the lover of shark themed movies. The acting is actually decent and the special effects are about as good as they come when dealing with animatronic sharks. It is definitely worth a watch!
5,Feeding Frenzy,"I enjoy creature movies and was pleasantly surprised by this one. The plot is simple and, with essentially two locales it is low budget, but it all works. The ex-girlfriend is the only part of the movie that I did not like but I could ignore it. I will consider purchasing this to add to my collection."
2,Mildly entertaining,I think the title of this review says it all. Mildly interesting at best. You must suspend the concept of reality to enjoy it.
3,Better than expected,"A gory and funny creature feature with decent effects. The acting is to be desired, but the pacing of the film makes up for it."
3,Not too bad,"This is entertaining enough to watch once, though there is no need for repeat viewings. There might be some sort of ecological message buried in it but they are not explicit about that point."
4,Bait on Blu Ray 3D,"After a robbery gone wrong in a local supermarket Queensland Australia a deadly Tsunami hits the beach community and a group of survivors from all walks of life end up getting trapped in the submerge supermarket and as they try to escape to safety , they soon discover that there are a couple hungry great white sharks starving for fresh meat and as the sharks start picking the survivors one by one the group realizes they must work together to survive .This is a good movie and a lotta fun from start till the end with a good clear picture and sound as for the 3D side of it : I replaced 3 receivers & 2 TV's in over 3 years give o take so just building up my 3D collection for now even so the 2D picture is pretty good .Bait 3D & Blu Ray comes in the one disc and a DVD combo pack , R rated approx 93 minute ... Good Show ."
2,"Good for some chuckles..terribly cheezy, nothing 'horror'ible about it","Sci-fi channel-grade special effects, terrible dialogue, and storyline. Definitely good for a few laughs, but that's about it. Painfully boring and shallow, har har...Want to see a REAL scary shark flick (besides the great classic Jaws)? Then watch ""The Reef"". Methodical, disorienting, and endless tension and uncomfort :)"
1,"dumbest movie since ""stop or my mom will shoot!"" UGH","seller was perfect in all ways, BUT this flick stinks! p u !!!!! it was really dumb, and yet i could not turn it off! well, there goes 2 hours of my life i will never get back! :) the blond bone-head in this flick has got to be the worst actress i have ever seen! i know her part was that of a dip-stick, but she was so bad i would litrally fast forward thru all of her scenes. i just couldnt take her anymore! (her dog was cute tho) :)"
4,Fun time passer...,"I actually liked this movie. Im sure we have all seen better shark effects (deep blue sea), but it's more than passable here (here and there). I liked the different location, the grocery store, the tsunami...all aded flavor."
4,Fun!,Awesome PremiseGreat Shark ScenesGreat 3DBargain Basement SoundtrackGeneric CharactersMeh PlotAbsent Special Features (storyboards are really tiny)
5,bait,"bait movie is far better than jaws, we loved it, everyone please buy it , you wont be disapointed, its a great movie."
3,entertaining,"good b movie if you like that sort of thing, stupid but thrills 3 d made it fun slash on"
3,WHOOPS! Wrong review for Movie!,"Sorry about that viewers...wrong review for this ""fish story!""This one was so far fetched it was a riot to watch. Can you imagine being chased by a shark in a flooded supermarket?"
5,Awesome movie !,Very well acted and great story. Was more than I ever expected. A nail bitter and great shark scenes. Russell Mulchany of Highlander fame wrote and produced the film. The best shark movie since Jaws !
3,"Love the animatronic sharks, but still hate the CGI ones...","Rented 'Bait' because i heard they used animatronic sharks vs CGI, but was disappointed by the unnecessary and always obvious use of computer generated creatures, which always move unrealistically fast and never fool anyone. Other than the sharks, the story was trying too hard to be complex and sometimes simpler is more believable. Decent fun to be had, but could have been better."
4,this movie is pretty good,"i watch this movie and it was al right ,,would i recommoned this movie ,,yes ,if you like sharks this is it ,,,,"
2,misleading title,"The product was fairly disappointing as I expected a 2 pack of signs. It turns out that it was a two sided sign. Furthermore, rather than the solid plastic I was expecting, it was made of corrogated plastic (like cardboard except plastic instead of paper) which means it has a tendency to blow over unless weighted down."
1,Poor Quality,"The quality is non existant for this product. It is lightweight, and made of cardboard. Do not recommend you buy, rather buy the little green man made of heavier plastic that can be weighed down by filling with sand or water. Waste of $25"
3,Product is what I expected,"The signs are two sided corrugated plastic. They are fairly sturdy but are a little smaller than expected. They look larger online than the actual 11x17 dimensions, but they are more than adequate in size to be visible from a safe distance. They are a bit light and would definitely blow away in a stiff wind. We use a baseball sized rock in the bottom to weight it down. The package I purchased came with 2, two sided signs."
2,KIDS DRIVEWAY SAFETY SIGN,Very Flimsy and does not stand up when there is the lightest wind. It also blows away easily. They should include a stake for it but they don't.
1,Not worth it.,This is not worth it if you have any wind in your neighborhood. It does not have any weight to it and will simply blow down the street with any degree of wind. Not worth it unless you get a 5 lb weight to hold it down.
1,I would like to order product to send to UK,"Kidkusion Driveway Safety Sign -2 PackHi,I am disappointed that I cannot directly contact the company to ask why I cannot order the item and have it sent to the UK.I would pay the extra for postage and that I would be happy to waive all warranty terms and conditions that would apply for US customers. I cannot see what they would be considering it is corrugated plastic with screen print.Anyway if this changes it the future I would gladly purchase this product.CheersChris"
3,flimsy signs,"The purchase was smooth and I would use this company again, but the signs are flimsy and even held down with rocks, blow away in the wind. I would spend the extra money on something more sturdy."
3,Good price but not durable.,"I wondered why the price was so low, they are not durable. I don't expect them to last more than a year. Whatever it takes to keep my kids safe."
3,confusing,"Safety sign is advertised as a 2-pack, in reality it is a ""sandwich board"" and can only be used at one location.Needs to be advertised differently as I thoughtI would be receiving two separate signs."
1,Not worth the money,These signs are cardboard and blow over in just the gentlest breeze. Definitely not worth what I paid. I will be going out to buy something sturdier and these will be tossed in the garbage!
2,Theses are a little flimsy,I bought these to put in the street when my children are playing ball out front. It doesn't take much of a wind to knock them over.
2,Not a 2 pk,For the money I thought I wa getting 2 signs not 1 that is 2 sided. It is are very lightweight.
4,The best water filtering system I've tried.,"I tried few other brands, Clear2O is absolutely the best one I've used.1- It fills quick (about 90 seconds), not like other brands (3 - 10 minutes).2- Has a true indicator that tells you when you need to change the filter, most other brand have just a reminder not an actual indicator.You need to install an attachment to your sink faucet, in order to secure the hose tightly when you need to fill the pitcher, the installation is very easy, and I didn't get any leaks that others complained about, also the filters are available at ""Wall Mart""."
1,Too complicated...................,I bought this item under the assumption that this would be like the regualar water filters. But this one has a seperate pipe attached to the jug. and everytime you want to fill the jug you have to connect it to the tap. and this makes it difficult. I would suggest buyers to consider other water filters
2,skimpy,"This is a pretty limited course in a lot of different respects. It doesn't treat grammar as thoroughly as it should and the amount of vocabulary it offers won't get a learner past the very beginning level. There is a little bit of material on the Arabic alphabet, but the very short dialogues are all written in a confusing system of transliteration, even though probably the majority of English-speaking students of spoken Arabic have already studied Standard Arabic for a while and of course know the alphabet. So there isn't really a whole lot here, although if you buy the accompanying CDs they will give you a good idea of how to pronounce words. Check out the American University in Cairo Press for some much more comprehensive courses (although be forewarned that the 'Kallimni 'Arabi' series by Samia Louis is almost entirely written in Arabic and would be very hard to do without a teacher."
1,Not good enough to be a text book,Overall quality very poor...Just went through all topics of RDBMS but didn't explain properly...Difficult to understand and not good as an introductory book..
4,Dry and thorough,"When I first started reading this book, I almost cried at how dry and boring it was. However, I finally got over that and was able to stay awake long enough to keep up with the readings for my class. Overall, this text book offers a lot of information on database management - from conceptual modeling to SQL DDL and DML to physical schema considerations and data warehousing. I think it is a great intro text for anyone getting into the DBA game. The section on SQL was more in-depth than I thought it would be and even gets into co-related nested queries and working with some useful functions."
2,bad structure,Not structured very well - too much text; too much unnecessary.I cannot recommend this bok for studying. I am happy to have it bought cheap and not a newer edition.
5,Works for my 2010 class,"My instructor didn't require a textbook for class, but he recommends getting this book as the ""database"" information hasn't changed greatly and he still gives homework assignments from this book. His lectures come mostly from the book, so having the book in-hand has helped me study."
1,Not an easy read,"Our database teacher recommended this book. I bought this book and found it not an easy read. After going through the whole book still I could not understand how the database design process works. Then I went on google to look for some thing easy to understand. I found a book called ""Relational database design for starters: Explained through a case study in Microsoft Access"" by Akmal Masood. This book is very easy to understand and after finishing the book, I was able to understand how the database design works."
1,Dry reading,"Packed full of information but very dry reading. I think it doesn't engage the reader very well. I bought this book for a college course and found it difficult to read (and I have database experience) because the material was just well, dry and redundant. Could have been way better."
5,A Must Read: Offers a great perspective with a humorous bent,"A Must-read! I'm 32 and watched stocks of mine like Lucent go to ZERO. (So much for my savvy investing and early retirement plans.) But Taking Stock helped to give me a prespective and feel better about things. It was, in parts,very empathetic (I have to say that I felt better knowing that other peoplelost as much asI did...) but it was also upbeat, reflective,and really funny at times. One of the most important things is that the book encouragedme to move forward, figure out what matters, and put my energy into that...I think that it is an important read that will help put things into a healthy perspective."
5,Love them,"for the price of these you really can not get a better deal, I wear them everyday and they are holding up very well. and if anything ever happebs to them I can just buy another pair for cheap, I recommend this product to everyone."
2,Not made Well,"I have been buying these shoes in NYC for 4 years, and this is my first time buying them online. These are of slightly worse quality than normal. The grommet that hold the laces to the shoe fabric come lose very quickly.But shipping was very fast and efficient."
3,Skinny Feet,"These shoes appear to be very durable, they actually look really cool too, the problem is they are too narrow. I checked the sizing chart for my shoes and I got a size 40, which is supposed to be a size 10, instead I got something like a size 9 or 8 1/2. If you buy these shoes you may want to get one size up if you have wide feet, I'm sure these are good shoes, I just can't test them."
4,Very good martial arts shoes!,"I've had these shoes for a couple weeks and like them very much! They are perfect for martial arts workouts. I use them when working on the heavy bag and for forms practice. They provide good stability, light weight and maneuverability. At this price, buy two or three pairs and have back-ups!"
3,good but not for everyday,"Wear out pretty fast if you wear everyday.. so wear them sparingly, or just wear them for martial arts (which I guess that is what they were intended for) :Dthey look cool tho!"
4,good,i got these shoes for my son and he seems to really like them he wears them everyday and they seem to hold up ok
4,Good shoe for the right purpose,"I got these shoes for a few things, mostly Parkour training and casual wear (let's be for real, these are one stylish pair of shoes). I wear an 11.5 mens and I went with the 45s, which fit almost perfectly, a little loose, but good. I sometimes bike in them, with sharp pedals that tear up the measly rubber bottoms. But at the same time they are very grippy on almost all surfaces except hardwood floors and the like. The bottoms will collect dust or whatever and become pretty slippery. But they are very light and comfortable to wear casually. One complain I have is that there is barely any breath-ability so my feet get pretty hot wearing them. But overall, a great shoe, for 15 bucks!! Who can complain??"
5,have fun fine-tuning your commitment,"Cheryl McClary's humorous and optimistic perspective on commitment has produced a treasure. This book is both lighthearted and serious, and supplies proactive, introspective journaling and action guidance for women who want their commitments to add value, joy and fun to their every day."
5,Do Yourself A Favor And Listen To This Woman,"Cheryl McClary has combined wit and common sense to tell us all what we should have heard from our mothers. If you can't afford to buy the book...beg, borrow, or steal it. Lock the front door, take the phone off the hook, order dinner in and make yourself comfortable for a night of everything you've needed to know about how to fix what's wrong in your life. You owe it to yurself as a woman."
5,Great!,"Wow! I wish I'd known some of this stuff sooner... Read ""Commitment Chronicles"" and learn how to save a marriage or just save a date! Cheryl's many years as a successful wife and mother make this an excellent book for women who want to know how to look at a relationship, whether you are in one or just trying to start out on the right foot. Whether you are married, dating, or just disgusted with the runaround, ""Commitment Chronicles"" is great."
5,Happiness for a lifetme with my husband,"With all of the educational information and credentials that the author list, I fully expected a medical text book type of reading from this book. The Commitment Chronicles: How to Stay Happily Married was recommended to me by a friend, and I thought, well, I will at least read one chapter. I am now glad I took her recommendation! It has been worth the time. I found that although Dr. McClary is fully qualified to write on the topic of marriage from a professional stand point, she has chosen to write it from a woman's and wife's viewpoint. I found this realisticly refreshing enough to apply to the ""everyday living"" that goes with being happily married. This is not some ""up in the cloud, one day happy emotional, good feeling reviving"" type of book. It gives useful and helpful hints that will assist you in finding a way to be happy yourself, then to work on talking-listening skills, and lastly intimacy revvers that are sure to keep you happily married."
5,looking for love is all the right and wrong places,cheryl mcclary has great insight into relationships and marriage. she makes the point clear that you must learn to love yourself in order to love anyone else. I recommend this book for anyone and everyone who wants to develop themself as an individual and in relationships.
2,Not As Good As Advertized,"I think this book is too much advertized by Flylady and youthink it is really that good but I found out that much of itis common sense. I did not agree on hersaying about leaving the place ie. the restaurant, when herhusband offended her, with her two other friends and went somewhere on her own. What? Isn't it rude just to leave yourhusband and friends without saying a word? Nothing struck me that stuck on my head about this book."
5,Very Informative,I am a senior in college and I am to be maried in the spring of 2003. Dr. McClary's book gave me a lot of insight into what it really means to be married and also gave me a better understanding of what it takes to be committed to a marriage and your partner as well as yourself.
4,This is Where It Is,"The Arhurian legend gets big when his best knight Lancelot of the Lake has an affair with Queen Guinevere. In the movie Excalibur the Queen is championed to defend her innocene. Malory, a great prose writer."
1,Watch out for the warranty,"I purchased the model 2004 Ducane grill and paid extra for the lifetime warranty. When my lava grate and several other parts rusted through, I called to get replacements and they informed me that the warranty would not be honored because it turns out that Ducane went bankrupt and was bought out by Weber. Weber will not honor the warranty even though they are still selling Ducane grills. Weber/Ducane now wants me to pay a couple of hundred dollars to purchase replacement parts that are covered under warranty.I expected when I paid a premium price for a high end grill, I would get both a good product and good service. It turned out that I got only an average product and useless service. Why pay $800-$1000 for a grill (which is what the model 2004 cost) when it doesn't perform any better than a $300 grill and the company won't even honor the warranty?"
5,"""TOP OF THE LINE""","I am 56 years old and now have my 3rd Ducane Grill. They are absolutely the BEST grills made. The great part is my son and my Father-in-law still have my 2 previous Ducane grills and they love them also. A Ducane Grill is like a Rolex watch, you might want to get the newest model but there are always people who want the one you have now. If something goes wrong, which isn't likely, they take care of it. When you think of ""Ducane"" you think of Quality. By the way, I also have the ""Take it or Leave it"" grill for tailgating at football games. I couldn't be happier. thanks."
3,"BUMMER, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HIGHER QUALITY.","For a grill advertised at $2000 (I don't think so), my expectations were pretty high. While I haven't yet grilled on the unit, I am really unimpressed with the fit & finish and the construction. (1.)The knobs easily pull (fall) off. (2.)The doors for the cabinet rub metal-on-metal. (3) The bottom of the shipping container contained 2 assembly screws that appeared to have fallen off the grill somewhere, but I couldn't find where. (4)I was expecting cast iron grates. (5)LP tank not included, but that may have been listed in the description. IMHO, for $650, you can probably do a little better...for $2000, you should do a lot better. We'll have to see how she ""cooks""."
5,Shopping For My Second-Ever DUCANE Gas Grill,"Congrats to the folks at Amazon.com for getting involved in the marketing of DUCANE gas grills. Having lived OCEAN-FRONT in Ponte Vedra Beach, FL for many years, I was accustomed to replacing my grill annually due to the elements they endured. My neighbor, a local propane gas dealer, adamantly encouraged me to switch to DUCANE 8 years ago based on the quality of construction and materials (The grill COVER alone is incomparable....) Other than replacing 4 weather-pitted wheels once (Which DUCANE promptly sent me....Their customer service people are most ""Refreshing"" to deal with)), my eight year old, stainless steel, DUCANE 5004SS is still performing perfectly and I'm gifting it to my son. After reviewing your informative web-site in my grill shopping search, I will now decide between a DUCANE4005SS OR the exciting new DUCANE ChuckWagon 7200R.....Thanks for simplying my new grill purchase!!"
1,Made by Weber...Warranted by Nobody,"Yes, it is true that Weber bought Ducane. They kept the brand, but they won't honor the lifetime warranties! So here I am stuck with this piece of junk that cost me nearly $2k and Weber wants me to buy more parts from them to the tune of $400. Jim Stephen, the CEO of Weber-Stephen should be ashamed to put his name on this piece of junk. I'm outraged."
2,Disappointed With Quality,"When purchasing a grill in this price range,one expects to receivea quality product as represented in the product description. Thisgrill despite the hype does not measure up.First,you do not get the Americana version as described. You getthe standard 4005. I guess they are the same.Secondly, an excellent design is severely compromised by poorworkmanship.The doors are misaligned with stripped screw holes andwarped to prevent secure closing.The ad describes the included tank and vinyl cover. You getneither.I am disappointed that an excellent grill is poorly assembled.I believe a better choice is the Jenn-Air grill at 2/3 the cost."
2,nice grill but over priced,"the 4005 grill is a nice grill, but it has a few design flaws.the two large front doors, when closed do not line up right. and when you clean this grill watch out for sharp edges also this is quite a heavy unit and the two front casters are snaped into plastic inserts and over time (short time!!) will fall out. don't buy this grill!!!"
3,Weaker Third Outing For The Sive Clan.,"The third and perhaps final chapter that started with ""The Front Runner"" is a well meaning but average book. Patricia Nell Warren seems to move as effortlessly into the skin of a thirteen year old boy as she did a thirty and then forty year old man. But that's what was also the disappointment to me. Taking the perspective of John Williams, Billy Sive's son, the book felt like an advanced young adult book that subtly conveyed messages of acceptance and tolerance.The strength of the novel is on the chracters we already know like Harlan, and Chino. But this isn't their story, and they're merely supporting characters in John's coming of age drama. Over all I enjoyed the book, it just didn't captivate me like the ""Front Runner' originally did, and people expecting that kind of story will be disappointed."
1,Don't Bother,"Unfortunately, it goes from good to worse to ""don't bother"". Skip all sequels to Front Runner. The writing is trite, the stories disappoint, and the books are even worth saving. It's unfortunate, but true. Save your money."
4,Addictive Game,"From the moment I installed this game I was hooked. Who doesn't want to control other people's lives? To be honest since this is just the base game after you get the feel of the game and how to play it will get boring. So before you buy it make sure you can afford and your computer can handle a few expansion packs and maybe even some of the stuff packs that are offered. However, it is worth the investment."
3,Beware of freezes and crashes with low RAM!!,"If you only have 256 MB RAM, the game will freeze constantly. I just got it and I have all kinds of problems with it. I played it for all of 10 minutes before it totally crashed. They should not even say you can play it with that low of RAM. Once I get a memory upgrade, I'm sure it will be the bomb, but for now it sits in the box. You need at least 512 MB of RAM to play this game. Also, I could not find the DVD version available on Amazon. What is the difference between the DVD version and the CD-ROM? I will update my review once I can actually play it!"
4,Fun but Tired,"This game sounds fun, and I've got to admit, the first games were fun also. I've read all of the reviews and have seen all of the screen shots, but I'm tired of waiting for this to come out. First the release date was in May, then in June, now it's in September. I'm just about to give up on ordering unless they give a date they'll stick to because I was so excited about recieving the game in June, too bad that's not gonna happen."
4,The Sims 2,I received this game a few days ago and installed it the following day (ended up taking almost 2 hours to get it to install as it kept freezing up my computer which is not even a year old yet). I have played it a few times and absolutely love it. I have been addicted to The Sims games ever since I started playing the original version of The Sims over a year ago. The graphics are superb though if you've got an older and or slower computer playing this game WILL be a nightmare. The Sims 2 is VERY graphics heavy.I am quickly becoming just as addicted to this game as I was to The Sims.
5,Sims 2,"I can't wait for the sims 2 to come out. Everyone who has bought the sims will enjoy this game. No more balcony shots you will be able to look at the game as though you are actually there. Also the sims will age if you want them too (if you turn on the mode). Also thier are more cause and effect relationships such as if your sim does not exercise he will become obese and the decsions a sim makes as a teen will determine who they are as an adult. Also a sim will not have to work every day, only five days a week. This game seems a lot more relistic then the sims and a lot more fun."
3,Jesum Crow,This Date thing goin alll the way back to August 31st is ridiculas....ne1 else agree??sure sure we wont get as much bugs...but i dont even think i've ever gotten ne in the 1st games...that i knew of...and i bet u pple who got bugs will still get bugs!!they Shouldn't have tricked us saying it was gonna come out in March ... what fibbers... i could've gotten a better brithday present...you kno back in january!(mad face)
5,Need it! Want it! Must have it!,"My only complaint or concern about this game is why are they (EA Games) torturing us by making us wait SOOO LONG!!! We've been waiting for this game ever since we heard about it when I bought Making Magic for my daughter for Xmas. I'm dying, here! I've got to have it? Please???"
3,I CAN'T WAIT!!,"Okay, I'm a Sims nut! I have all of the Sims one games/expansion packs, and played them for hours on end. I have been awaiting this game since I heard about it last winter! I haven't gotten to play it yet, as I have to get a new PC because mine is around 7 years old (Pentium 2 proc. and very old video and sound). However, I have complete confidence that this game will be great and much better than the first. I'll be sure to update when I get to play it!"
1,Doesn't Work -- Always Crashes,"This game does not work despite the patches and tech support. It will always crash at random times during game play. Also, if you do get it to work, it is so slow that you decide that you don't really want to play anymore. I'd give it a higher rating if it actually worked."
1,It Won't Run!,"After puchasing the recommended $100.00 video card, many viedo-driver downloads, hours on the telephone with EA support, and countless emails to EA support, we cannot get this game to run on a 2-year old computer. Needless to say we are very disappointed."
2,The Sims 2,"I found that the only new features were aging, and jobs for teens. If they could just create an expansion pack with the 2 things I mentioned above for the sims, then the game would finally have basically everything needed. I find that the Sims 2 people are really annoying, I now realize that I liked the Sims with a few expansion packs better. It (The mega deluxe sims) is definately more fun and has it's faults too, though I noticed it had less. I highly reccommend The mega deluxe sims. Mabey Sims 2 is for you. It has aging and jobs for teens but not very many outfits and the items don't look very good together."
2,The overall appeal of the sims franchise is tired.,"I was pathetically excited to get my copy of this game, I waited for over a year, used some lotto money to get it, and after playing the game for about 2 hours, felt as if the whole premise of the game has lost its luster to me.With the first sims, everything was, compared to the sims 2, simple, there was not quite as many options as the sims 2, and it never was very complicated.Now, in the sims 2, making a nose can take 5 minutes, houses can take hours. And, because it's new, and there are very few downloads available for it, there really is very limited variety. Making one room can be this nauseating experience in which one spend most of their time clicking away, and feeling sorry for their index finger.I know this review is vague, and may not help much but here is my (long) final note.The sims 2 brings such limited variety and gastly complexity to the plane, that I can no longer see what so enthralled me about this stupid game in the first place."
1,I'm wondering...,"I'm beginning to wonder if the sims 2 will EVER come out. They've pushed back the date SO MANY TIMES. The reason I'm wondering is because that's what they did with Simville. They said it would be out by early 2001, then it was late 2001 and soon they decided not to release it!!! What the heck, I'm still waiting 3 years for a stinkin' sim game! I'm thinking that is what's happening with the sims 2... they give you a good glimpse of it and then decide it's not worth their time. I would be one bit surprised if it ever came out. I'll believe it when I see it!"
4,Can't wait for this Sims,"I too love playing The Sims, including Sim City and another type of simulation game zoo tycoon. This new one should be great but how much memory am I going to need. Oh man I'm going to have to upgrade to a faster bigger computer! I better start saving."
2,Eh.,"Sure, the graphics are good, if you can get them loaded in a timely manner. And yeah it's neat how you can customize some more, but as you try to adjust the facial features, etc. it distorts the image even moe so you really don't know what the final result will be. And having to control everything and I do mean EVERYTHING in the game is annoying. I fine to work for goals and things like that, that was part of the fun for me with The Sims, but you're basically running the software yourself and it takes away fromt he gaming experience. Give it a shot if you want, but if I had known this stuff from the beginning I would have saved my money."
3,I strongly recommend it,"Is a really fun game, where you can make your dream neighborhood, and with lots of sims in activity"
2,I dont understand why Sims is such a hot game!?!?,"I purchased this game over Thanksgiving break because I was bored and had read SO many positive reviews! This game was NOT fun at all!! Way too much mundane everyday stuff to put your sims people through...I do this stuff everyday! Give me a game where Im fighting someone or shooting other motorists or saving the world...SOMETHING that I dont do everyday!Thus concludes my review of this game...If you got money to spend, find another game to buy!!"
4,"Eh, it's ok....","Sims 2 is ok. It's a little boring and a little tiresome. After a while you realize and wonder why you are playing a game where you control the lives of imaginary people and getting worked up over the things they do?pros: Good graphics and easy to play and have fun with and get addicted the FIRST time around.Cons: Why would anyone want to be a control-freak and control almost everything that someone does? Do you like playing God? If so, I guess this is the game for you.But....if you don't have a life, try to go get one outside."
1,Sorely Disappointed!!!,"When my granddaugter received this game which she had been so excited about, she was unable to play it. The code needed to upload the game was not included-- so it was a complete bust. She has a game that she cannot play."
3,DOES *NOT* WORK WITH VISTA,I bought this on Amazon knowing it said to have at least Windows XP or 2000 but hoping it would work with Vista anyway after reading another review that seemed to suggest it could be done. I just want to let other customers know that it does NOT work with Vista. I uploaded all 4 CD's to my computer and it was AFTER i had done so that my computer told me there were known compatibility issues with using that software on Vista. So i never got to play the game and do not know how it is but will be looking to sell my game. I will wait til upgrading to Windows 7 and perhaps SIMS will offer a Windows 7 version sometime in future.
4,good but not great,"better graphics, more realistic, but items and options for building and designing are lacking"
4,Sims!,"This game is great. Unfortunately, hours can be spent playing it, and when you finally look at the clock, you will realize you have missed most of the day... or night. A friend of mine got me hooked on Sims, but mine runs very slow (even though my computer meets requirements). So if you're considering buying this, definitely make sure the game won't lag or crash unexpectedly. A definite plus with sims 2 is genetics. And there are more clothing styles, Body Shop is great too, along with downloading Custom Content. Overall, this is a great game... Addicting... but Great."
4,A great way to spend time learning time management...,"Like the previous Sims games, this is addictive. As an RPG GM, the ability to control these tiny Sims lives is fantastic!The graphics are great, the interactions between the Sims is more complex and the fan base has responded with it's typical flair..."
5,Great game,It is the greatset game ever.You get hooked and cant get off it. So some day I am going to collect all the Sims games .!!!!!!
4,It's great!,"I loved the Sims 1 games and I think that Sims 2 is just as good! I love the 3D effects and how you can make a character more your own.I didn't like that there were no pets, though. In Sims Unleashed, there had been lots of pets and I thought that since Sims 2 was a step up, they would have 3D pets with cool toys and features.Also, I would have liked my Sims to be Superstars, like in Sims Superstar. Now, with the new features, the Superstars would be prettier.Other than that, I loved the game and recommend it!"
4,For those who have never had the expansion packs to TS1,"Well, to tell you the truth, I haven't recieved the game yet, but I am still giving it four out of five stars. For someone who has never been able to buy the expansion packs to the sims will really enjoy this game,1. because it has better grafics2. because there is more to interact with and do3. there is a community lot!4. there are more neighborhoods5. Your sims can now grow up!That's what I think. I rated this game four out of five because, I am a Christian and this game has some things which my morals don't agree with. I wish that you could have religion or no religion instead of star signs. Keep simming!"
1,I agree,"To all the people who are complaining about the shipping, GET OVER IT!!!!! You'll get the game sooner or later. Ya'll act like you will die without the game. Get a life! There's so much more to do then waiting around for a game to arrive. I admit i'm excited about getting the game but not to the point where i'm furious over a sept 17 shipping date, Gosh its only 1 day away for christ sake! I have more important things to care about like school."
5,A Sim like me!!!,The Sims will be life like. I can make it have certain facial...SO COOL. I heard that was the last Sims but At least you know that there's nothing better than the Sims like Animal Crossing Et Cetera.
2,the question is. . . Is it ever gonna come out,"The Sims2 looks really cool. . . but is it gonna come out. They have pushed it back [several times]! Is it ever gonna come out. Than again the longer it takes the better game it is. Here is a list of some new cool features for the sims2*Each sim has their own special DNA*Sims can age from baby, toddler, teen, adult, old farts (old farts sooner or later die)*You can cut your sims hair*The kids look like their parents*Houses can have a basement and up to 4 levels*It is 3D*Sims actually cook stuff such as lobster*Each food your sim cooks you have to go gocery shoping for the ingriedents*The higher cooking skill your sim has the more stuff they can cook*Sims are more aware. example: If a girl sim is taking a bath in front of a window a boy sim can look in and watch(...)"
3,amazing and slow,"This game is amazing, although there are a few setbacks:1. huge program.2. so many technical issues. you need an updated video card, if you dont have one, visit your respective website, you can download one for free.3. the game is so slow! i fell asleep several times waiting for the next scene to load.Overall, I love the game, but if you aren't patient or if you have an older, less than regularly maintained computer, I wouldn't recomend it. The graphics and options are amazing, but the loading time is extremely frustrating. Given the option, I would rather have the graphics from Sims 1 if that meant that loading wouldn't take so long."
3,Sims 2 for windows,"While Sims 2 is very popular among teens and ""tweens,"" it does not operate well on PC's built before Vista. (Note, Sims 2 does NOT require Vista to run.) However, because Sims 2 pans 360-degrees (and therefore requires a lot of pixels) it does require at least 1 megabyte or more of RAM. Otherwise, it is subject to frequent ""freeze-ups"" and ""crashes."" The registration process for Sims 2 is cumbersome, but I don't think you can get the cheat codes without it. My daughter loves Sims 2, but it is very time-consuming for kids to construct the play environment from scratch. As it involves topics such as sex and death, it might not be appropriate for younger or less mature children."
3,the original sims review,i just started playing the sims and when i get a baby u have to kiss a lot but if both the parent work it's very hard cause u have to quit 1 of the jobs i think for the telephone u need to have a babysitter!!
1,The Worst Computer Game Ever,I got this game at Costco a few months ago thinking that it was a good game. I've trusted all the Sims and they have decieved me. This game is a worthless piece of s***. I would much rather buy The Simpsons Hit & Run or some classic game like that. When the first Sims came out I thought that it was really cool that you can build your own families and have lives of your own. But it gets boring as hell after like 1 minute. This one I thought was good because you can have a baby and build them yourself. I returned the game the next day because I needed my refund back for such a stupid game. Don't buy this game and take it from experience. Buy the Simpsons DVD's instead they are the best show in the world than the Sims 2 DVD.
1,this is a lot of fun (oh yeah),this game is the worst game that was made in the whole wide world. this game is rubbish
1,IT SUX MAN!!!,i've already tried it and i thought it was going to be GREAT!! did u hear me i said GRRR-EEATTT!!! I was sadly dissapointed.....non of it was REALISTIC even tho it looked like it would be.. they completely lied about all the features they SUCK DUDE!! maybe sims 3 will have a LITTLE improvment TRUST me all the websites u go on and read about it are lying!! there arent all those stages of life........well looks like back to the barbies for me...ATLEAST there REALISTIC!! yea and guess what else they've kno changed the sim language to chinese not jibberish so hav fun little chinese children!! but u probably think'll suk 2 even if it is in ur littl language!!
1,Bad Purchase,"While this game may be fun for those who can get it to work, my advice is to buy it at the start of a weekend from a brick and mortar store. That will give you time to stop payment on your credit card/check if it doesn't work. For the brave ones out there, be ready to do lots of updating to your p/c just to see if it will work for you. Meeting the minimum requirements does NOT mean this game will play. Check out the BBS at www.thesims2.com to see just how many unfulfilled game players there are. My recommendations ......... wait a few more months till EA solves some of the problems with this game before putting any of your money on it. If you have no technical know-how, stay away all together."
2,Good for Some,"I am a huge fan of the Sims I and when the the Sims II came out I had to have it. I bought the game from best buy and i was disappointed to find that it dosent work on my computer! It took me eight hours to load! my computer is new too, it is a december 2003 dell! i have played the game though and it is awesome, however you need to have the newest computer on ther market to be able to play it on your computer, when I asked best buy why this happpened they said you need to buy some $300 digital thing in order to play. So my advice to you is to not waste the money, stick with Sims I until Sims II comes out for your Playstation 2, xbox, gamecube, etc."
5,The Sims 2 will be GREAT!!!!!,The Sims 2 is a new and improved version of The Sims. I've been playing the sims for about a year now and i love it. I have checked out some stuff about the Sims 2 (coming out before August 2004)*Sims no longer will look really wierd unless their parents do. (DNA is inherited.)*Rather than your sims just pulling anything they can find out of the refridgerator you go to the store and buy what you want. and you pay for it there not as you take it out of the fridge.*Brand new 3D graphics*you can se your sims from any angle.*you can now build basements attics decks 4 story houses and foundations all on hills.*sims grow from infant to toddler to child to teen to adult to elder and can die of old age.I think the best part of this game will be the new building features imagine making a mansion.
3,Havent Gotten it yet,"I'm just wondering why in the world would anyone preorder anything so far in advance. And then when they don't get it in the expected time, they complain. Well, my neighborhood store will have it on the 16th, and I'm getting it in the morning. I've waited forever for it, and I'm extremley excited. Why preorder and you can just get in the car or on the bus and go get it the day it comes out? I just don't understand. I never preorder anything. The trick is getting to the store on the day of release and getting there before anyone else.But I just wanted to say that I was excited to see as many reviews that I did, expecting to see actual reviews of the game, and what I got is order complaints. Save your complaints for Customer service, and let us see what you thought of the product."
3,Kinda Dissapointed,"Well this game is good but the load times are just way to long. Also it is much more complicated than the orignial Sims. IT takes so much longer to do a lot of things. I like all the new features but i wish they weren't as coplex as they are. Even with the slow load tims, there is glitches and they view gets messed up alot. And one final thing it runs to slow!!!"
5,the sims2,I AM SURE IT WILL BE EXASPERATINGLY FUN...but its not coming out until august and i am extremely DYIIIIIIIIIIIIIINGi need the sims 2statif you wanna tak about this im at mooitgood
1,Disappointing for old computers,"I just got the Sims 2 for my birthday, and I was ecstatic. However, I discovered that it does not work on my computer. I have a 2000 Compaq and it took 2 hours to install, and then an hour to load the tutorial family. It's extremely slow and freezes all the time, therefore I would only reccomend it if you have a top-notch computer."
5,Omg! the best game in the world!,"right!this game is totally the best game ever!ive got all the sim games and they're just great.But this one, after seeing its demo on making magic looks like the ultimate sims game!u have to get it!it will change the sims forever!i cant wait, and neither should you! buy it now!i recommend it to absolutely everyone!thanxxxxxx"
1,TOO SLOW!!!,"This is unplayable. EVERYTHING takes far too long. Saving, loading whatever you try to do takes many seconds and in some cases minutes. This is running on a 3 Ghz P4!"
3,great game but difficult to run,We have played this at other people's houses but not yet at ours. Our computer is older and can't get it to run. We are replacing parts left and right. It takes an amazing amount of space up on your computer. Be prepared!!!!
5,Don't be scared if you think your computer can't handle this,"Basically, this game is hands down 100% better than the Sims 1, even with all of the extras that came with it. Sims 2 is more personal, outfits don't have to be paired with the same shirt and pants or whateva, and you can choose what kind of pajamas they wear, and there can be three floors on your houses, which saves a lot of space in order to build a big pool with a lot of outdoor space for your garden or swing set! but on to the topic; i have 2.8ghz processor and a Intel Extreme Video Card, and everything runs fine, although everything has to be on low, it does not take away from the game experience. don't be fooled by people saying that you need an expensive video card to play this game, it runs fine on my computer, just make sure you have at least 2ghz processor though. this will sure be the best selling pc game for 2005."
5,Was Sims perfect when it first came out? Of course not!,"And neither is this sequel. However, it has great potential, once the patch is available. Give it a try."
5,Awesome!,"I can't wait tell this game comes out! It'll be better than the orginal because...1.Sims can grow up! (baby,toddler,kid,teen,adult,and senor.2.Build better and bigger houses!3.Better graphics!4.In buy mode you can change designs on chair, beds, and so on.5.The game is going to be in 3-D!!!!!6.You can talk or even marry the maid, firefighter, police, and so on.7.More realistic!I'm counting down the days until this game comes out!!! (118)"
4,Playing God,"This game is quite enjoyable. It is a huge step ahead of the original Sims game, which I lost hours of my life to. The graphics have had quite a boost. There are a ton of new options for what you can do with other sims. In this version, your sim ages, which has its ups and downs. It's cool that a child is now able to become an adult, and an adult can become an old man. However, the time phrame for which you have between being an adult and being old seems a little short for my taste. Not a whole lot of time to move up in the business world. An aspect of this game that I really enjoy is the satisfaction meter which can be filled by meeting certain goals. If you meet enough of these goals, such as buying a particular item or having a child, your meter fills up and can help to increase your mood. Overall it's a good game with a lot of new features. If you enjoyed the first game, this is a must."
5,A great game!,"I think that this game is very fun and way better than The Sims 1. The graphics are 100 times better, and I love the fact that the sims get to grow up! You can also customize their faces to look exactly like yourself!One part I do not like about the Sims 2 is not the game itself, but the rating. They should have ""suggestive themes"" instead of ""sexual themes."" After all, when the sims have children or ""wwoo-hoo,"" you don't see any of it! And when they go to the bathroom or take a bath, it's blurred out!I hope this was helpful 2 you!(I am 12 yrs. old.)"
4,Fun Fun! But...,"I have been a sims fan since 2001, and I was very happy when the Sims 2 came out. I got it the day it came out actually. It is such an improvment from the first sims game. Just make sure you have a DVD drive on your computer before you buy the DVD edition.The graphics are great. ANd so are the Items, I love decorationg the houses with all of the cool items to pick from! Your sims just seem so much more real with their aspirations and wants and fears. There is only one thing I have to complain about...The Sims 2 is so sloooow! It takes forever to load and if you have all of the quality settings up all the way, game play will be slow also. I have a rather new computer also, so if you have a computer over 3 years old, I wouldn't buy The Sims 2 quite yet.I hope my review was helpful for you. Have fun!"
3,Not as fun as many had said,"I don't think Sims 2 is that fun. you are bascially catching up with all the things that the sims need (toilet, working, eating....showering). Other than that, I don't see any fun."
4,Great Game,"When the Sims 2 came out, I was very excited. Sims is an awsome game and very entertaing. I would play for hours without a break. I couldn't wait to buy the 2nd Sims, but when I finally did buy and install it, it would not work on my computer, even thought the original Sims did. This was a great disappointment. The graphics card that I need is so expensive that it would be cheaper and easier just to buy a new computer. I have played the Sims 2 and it is a very good game. It has a lot of new improvements, like aging, customizing your sims, and much more. I would just advise you to make sure your computer meets more than all of the requirements before you buy this game."
4,Greatly improves on the original,"A thought the original Sims was good, but this one is much better. The ability to modify the facial features of your sims allows you to create sims that look like practically anybody, yet it's simple to do. I made sims of my family (but unfortunately there is only one male head with long hair, and it's a mullet, so I look a little different in the game :) ). Also appreciated is that now your sims get days off -- in real life, this is when most of us get things done, and now your sims can too. Add to that a slew of in-game abilities and options, and you've got a much better Sims experience.On the downside, the content is a bit mature for younger players, and even on faster systems the load time is long."
5,Pure Genius!,"I believe that the sime 2 is one of the most briliantly designed games of all time! The grapphics are incredible, the level of detail put into this game is astounding! The creators of this game really put alot of effort into this game...AND IT SHOWS! The gameplay is quite easy to master and unlike most other simulation games, the sims 2 does not get boring! You can play for hours and never encounter the same experiences. The options to customize your sims with are great! there are many hairstyles makeup and clothes options to make your sim UNIQUE! One of my favorite features of this game is the ability to cook different meals...that might sound weird...but its great to see the food which looks real as oppose to the mush in the older sims games. Some of the meals your sims are able to cook include: salmon, ribs, omlettes, cakes, lobster and spaghetti! The objects in the sims 2 are all finely crafted and look almost real! THIS GAME IS GREAT YOU SHOULD DEFINETLY PURCHASE IT!"
4,AWSOME!!!,This game is so awsome but its really hard to download. I love the fact that your sims have real DNA! I would reccomened this to whoever has an excalent imagination!
5,All new all better,"I really thought I'd play this game a week and go back to my old Sims. I loved making houses and neighborhoods so much, and I had so much stuff from Sims Resource and Well Dressed Sims. I just knew there was no way this game could satisfy my building urge. I was very wrong. I have been sucked into a world of stories and intrigue. My best friend and I discuss daily the differences our stories and Sims lives are taking. Who they are marrying, who they are sleeping with, who was born, and who died. When my first Sim died of old age, I actually felt a sense of loss. It's a lot of fun, but be prepared for addiction. Don't get this game unless you have a lot of free time. I'm pretty busy right now and it's driving me nuts. I highly highly recommend this game."
2,If it would only work,"This game is really fun if it works fine. The sims now have brains, and everything is basically like a super expansion pack. The problem is that it rarely works. I have a pretty new, fast computer, and the sims loaded pretty fast, and worked smoothly. But about every fifteen minutes it would completely freeze up, so I would have to turn the computer off manually. ctrl alt delete never works. I eventually got so sick of it freezing up I just stopped playing it. If you know a way to stop that from happening, go on and get the game. It is a good game. But if you don't like to constantly reboot your computer, this may not be the game for you."
1,Installed but won't run,"My 4-month old computer (well exceeding game requirements)installed the game just fine, but when I tried to play Sims2 I got, ""Please insert the correct DVD-ROM, select OK and restart application."" I have the DVD version. Body Shop and Bonus Disk work OK, just not the game. EA told me to send it back for a replacement - I hope it works. I love the Sims games and was looking foreward to this one. I have EA's 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' with very similar system requirements, and it has beautiful graphics and runs great."
1,Very disappointing game,"I bought this game and could not get it to work. I called EA customer service and they eventually had me return the game at my cost for replacement. I got another game, same problem. I could not get it to install. My computer meets all the requirement and would still not work. I can not recommend this game!!!"
5,Really Want,This game looks soooooooooo awesome! I want it so bad! I have a feeling that my parents are getting it for me for Christmas. I know nearly everything you can know about the Sims 2 without playing it. I love to read stories on [...].
3,Could have been alot better,i was so waiting for this game to come out and i wanted it really badly then when i got it was nothing like i thought no weather no this or that just totally different ea. is a corporate money maker and they don't care about us i really wish will right had his own business and make a game by himself it would be so much better and actually work most of the time. i mean this game is fun in a degree luckily I can play it but had to spend $300 to upgrade my PC.I know we all wanted it badly but if we would have waited till the winter season they probably could have would on it a lot better had weather and cars u cud own and all that good tuff o well.
2,I Must Be Weird...,"I don't like this game. At all. And it's not just the super-pokey loading time, either.I will admit that there are a LOT of positives to this game, but I wish they had just tweaked the old format with these positives and left it as it was, because this new format REEKS.There is a lot more space, but the land is just out of control, the furniture selections suck and the camera couldn't be worked by the best of the best at Columbia Pictures! (There are many other things I dislike, but I can't think of them all at the moment.)I'll give it a few more chances and also wait for the game guide (which I'm getting for my birthday). But at the moment, I'm sorry I asked for this game for Christmas."
1,The Game Wouldn't Play On My Computer,"If this game would've played on my computer, I would have given it alteast a 4, it looked like much fun, but it wouldn't, its rather ridcoulus that they set the requirements so high! I don't understand why they would do that, The only CD-ROM I've had to install on my computer."
2,!?,I'm a huge sim fan and I just bought this game with my longly collected allowance! It looks like a great game but I cant say more because you need an amazing video card to actually play - that was rather disappointing! I can't give it a higher rating till i actually manage to play the game!
4,The SIMS 2,this is my favorite game of them all! im trying to get all of the sims games they ROCK! i soooooo want the sims 2!
1,"Loved 'The Sims,' Hate 'The Sims2'","This game is extremely slow, freezes, and is blurry. I have uninstalled it, and reinstalled it once on my computer. It is still running with the same problems. My sister also bought it for her computer, hers freezes so that she has to completely restart her computer. Once it's frozen she can't even hit ctrl, alt, delete to close it out. I have all the original Sims games, but this one was not worth the $50. This game just has too many problems, I think I'll stick with the original Sims through Makin' Magic."
2,Hmmm....,"Well, what to say. I have all the expansion packs to the old games. When I heard that this game was going to come out I decided I was not going to buy it. I eventually did and hate it. My computer is less then 2 years old and the game has made it so slow. I wont be able to buy expansion packs because the stupid thing takes up to much room. I uninstalled it and put the old Sims back on. I am so much happier."
5,the best game ever,"this game will be the best game and you can have baby,s andteen,s and they can start to grow and i like that.so. you go maxis"
3,Disappointed,I had no problem installing the game but playing it was a different story.Some advice that helped my gaming experience:Upgrade your audio and video driversRemove any unnecessary background tasks (Task Manager)Refer to your SIMS2 instruction manual for more detailed instructions.
3,NOT AGAIN!!!,"I love the sims and can't wait for the new Sims 2 to come out but my lord what is up with all the release date push backs, it has been 4 or 5 of them now. I am freakin dying here MAXIS please get this game out soon. I gave 3 stars because I haven't played it yet obviously. (...)"
4,The Sims 2 (so much better than the Sims 1),"The Sims 2 is so much better than the Sims. You can have 3 floors Your Sims have a diary for recording first kiss, marriage, mistakes, etc.Your sims can have more than 1 kid at a time, and when they do, an ambulance picks them up. They go through many life stages. They can go SHOPPING!!!!!I only rated it 4 stars because it hasn't come out yet. If I can convince my parents to, I will DEFINITELY get the Sims 2."
3,"Cool, but doesn't work","I got the Sims2 and it seems awesome, but it won't work on my pc. I have windows ME, so that could be it. It's worth the money if your pc will let it run"
2,What was Maxis thinking?,"It was a stupid decision for Maxis to make a game this complex right off the bat. The best part of Sims 1 was that even if you didn't have the best computer, the game would still run great. That is not the case with Sims 2, becuse you HAVE to have a new computer to enjoy this game. Unfortionately, Many people who play the sims don't really have the BEST computers in the world.Hopefully Maxis will fix this with a patch of some sort.If you don't have a brand new computer, expect long load times, and very choppy graphics (depending on the size of the house). The best way to remedy the loading situation is to build a small house (and how fun is that?)."
5,Pre-Ordering was a waste of time!,My friend preordered the game from Amazon in April. And still hasnt received it.I went online yesterday and paid for it and it came today *L*There was no bonus for preordering like gamestop. They gave out a bonus disk. So I dont know what was the point of preordering it.Oh well... My friend cant play mine!
2,Come ON NOW PEOPLE!,"I had my fun with the SIMS and somewhat with the SIMS 2, but really, why would you play this game if you can do all the stuff yourself? It's like playing an interactive life.. just play a REAL life instead of this. I would only reccomend this game to people who can't get anything and make themselves and their crush live in a house and do.. stuff... ;)I do not like this game anymore.. sorry."
1,Not Very Excited About Sims 2,"I think the giving of 5 Stars for a game that you have never played is ridiculous. I am not excited about the release of this game, because, in my opinion, I think it sucks that after paying almost $200 for all of these Sims Expansion Packs, they are releasing another seperate set of them that are more expensive and are not compatible with anything we've purchased already? Not fair to those of us whom work hard for our money, have children to care for, or bills to pay with it. Also, most of us out here, according to the minimum requirements for Sims 2 that I've read, will have to upgrade our computers just to be able to play it...sorry not interested."
4,Hmm...,"As much as I love the regular sims games, I think I can say (and any other TSO members) that single player sims games do not even match up to The Sims Online...I am excited for the game, yet it might get boring fast compared to TSO"
1,"STAY AWAY!! STAY FAR , FAR AWAY!!","This game would be awesome IF IT WORKED!!! I would probably give the game 5 stars IF it did. I got the game as a gift and like alot(thousands)of other people I am extremly dissapointed with this game..I mean BUG! My PC exceeds the recommended requirements and it crashed everytime. It WILL crash anywhere from 30 seconds to 60 minutes into the game. It will sometimes crash Windows entirely(I have XP!)I've tried every video driver out there to no avail. Maxis says they're aware of the problem that ""some"" people are having and are supposedly working on a patch. I'd bet the farm EVERYONE is having a problem. HEY MAXIS, HOW ABOUT THIS FOR A CONCEPT, TRY TESTING YOUR STUFF BEFORE RELEASE!! NO ONE WANTS A BUG FOR A GAME! I'm glad I didn't spend my hard earned cash on this trash."
1,Very Slow,"I know that games are becoming more and more advanced, but this is a bit ridiculous. The game is EXTREMELY slow. It takes about 2 mintues to load the game, 5 minutes to load the neighborhood, and 15 minutes to load the family! Then once I actually get to play the game, it freezes up, I can't move the screen. I have turned off the background tasks, but it's so slow that I don't think I can play the game. I shouldn't have to go out and buy a brand new, top of the line computer just to play this game. It should have been made so that people with at least fairly new computers could play the game without any problems. I might be sending this one back!"
5,A Great Game Made Even Better,"I've been playing sim games since the early 1980s, starting with Utopia for Intellivision. Each game has taught me something. Each one helps us understand what the scholar Peter Senge described as ""systems thinking."" Through sim play, I've deepened my understanding of economics, business, city a regional development...the list goes on.Now comes the re-release of The Sims, the most popular sim game of them all. I was delighted with its emphasis on individality and creativity.However, like with the Sims 1, this game teaches us systems and more. In the Sims, the key message was balance. The Sims cannot achieve maximum levels of ""win"" without an appropriate balance of work, leisure, physical and mental needs...Sims 2 helps us personalize this even more - something I would not have thought possible. But the essential message remains: balance is key for the ""win.""What will we see for an encore??"
4,Great game but 3D is hard to get used to,"The Game over all is great, the visuals are awesome and the whole time line is idea is awesome. The only problems that I have with it are that one the 3D is very difficult to get used to (especially when you are building) and it seems like there should have been more items to buy...but I guess they are saving that for the expansion. It is a great game but make sure that you have a fast computer with a lot of memory or you will run into some problems."
5,can not wait,the sims 2 will come out on the 17th not the 14th check www.sims2.ea.com.no weather 6 lifestages its in 3-d sism have to play to have children sim moms are actually pregnat for 3 sim days gets picked by an ambulance and stay at the hospital for 3 sim days.totall life stage bout 100 sim days babys are babys for three days todlers are toddlers for 5 sim days.sims die of old age and lots more check the www.sims2.ea.com for more details
4,Beware!,"After installing this game it's would let me play because I have CD burning software (Nero) installed. I actually had to uninstall Nero to play. Seems EA decided to keep this little secret to themselves. No mention on the box or in the manual that this was a requirement. The good news, after playing the game once, I was able to reinstall Nero without and futher consequences. Pretty idiotic on EA's part.If you are running anything in the background on your computer while playing the game, you will freeze up. I suggest a program like EndItAll to close all (including antivirus protection)applications.I heard individuals purchasing the DVD version of this game aren't getting a users guide. You may want to consult the official Sims 2 site to see what you're missing."
4,"Fun Virtual Life Simulator, Very Different from Original","I was a big fan of the original The Sims (and its many expansion packs). So, when the Sims 2 came out, I bought a copy.At first, I was disappointed because the gameplay was pretty different (Wants/Fears added) and the expansion packs didn't seem as surreal as the first one (they seem to be more ""reality"" focused, whereas I prefer more surreal additions).Eventually, when I stopped comparing the 2 games, I found the Sims 2 very enjoyable. It is somewhat more complex, but adds a lot (Sims now grow up through various life stages and can have children who also grow up, not forever stuck at age 8 or so).The Sims 2 isn't a game to play if you're very goal-oriented, but it is a lot of fun to watch and let things unfold."
2,These games always stop working,I've bought my daughter several of the Sims pc games. I've downloaded and bought the hard copies but they all quit working after she plays them 2 or 3 times. I've tried switching to different pc's and redownloading them but they still don't work. It's impossible to get a response from EA sports when I try to contact them regarding this issue. I finally found a wii version that hasn't given me any trouble so far.
4,MySims2Experience,I love the game oh so much. My only dislike is that you have to install four disk before you play the game.
4,Excellent buy!,This game came in perfect condition and earlier than expected! It was well worth the buy. It downloaded onto my laptop quickly and didn't take up a lot of space.
4,Looks awesome!,"I cannot wait for the sims 2! It will be awesome! I heard there can now be 4 Floors + a basement! And I dont know about features from The Sims Expansions, but it will be MUCH more realistic, including weather. One of the videos shows a girl in a hot tub that gets electrocuted in the thunderstorm - and it looks like she still lives - Maybe now there is like a ""Health Points"" instead of 1 bad thing happens and your dead. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is cause if your a big fan like me, you probably spent alot of money on the original. I spent over $200 on the sims and the expansion packs..."
5,THE SIMS 2 PC CD-ROM GAME,"WHEN I FIRST STARTED PLAYING THE SIMS ABOUT 2 YRS AGO, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE COOLEST THING TO HIT THE PC WORLD. THEN ABOUT 1 MONTH AGO, I GOT AHOLD OF THE SIMS 2. WOW. I WAS IN SHOCK AT HOW REAL IT WAS. THE ABILITY TO BUILD THE HOUSE ANYWAY YOU WANTED, WITH A FOUNDATION, AND TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE ROOF TOPS ANYWAY YOU WANT, WAS SOMETHING UNREAL. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE IT. THE GRAPHICS ARE OFF THE WALL. THE ONLY OTHER THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS GAME, IS ""WOW"". THANK YOU...."
2,So Slow!!!,"I bet your wondering how in the world could I give the Sims 2 only 2 stars, well let me tell you. The game is excellent, it has a great new program to create sims, where you can make and create their faces in detail,the homes can now have 3 stories, you can interact with chacaters like the maid, etc. The graphics are all 3D and the sims have really cool new personailtiy traits. You can have a baby that uses the potty and that you have to teach to walk, etc. Alright, so why only two stars? THE GAME IS SOOOOO SLOW!!!! With all these excellent features it gets pretty furstrating waiting around to use them. My computer (which is a 2003 model) has crashed about a millon times now, and the game keeps on going off periodically. The game was $50 dollars and i can't even hardly play it. If you have an older model of computer and you don't mind the waiting and the crashing the game is definitly worth buying, otherwise, get the Urbz which is a great game!"
5,"Remember, the PC game IS NOT the same as The Sims 2 for PS2 and the other video game systems!","I've heard great things about this game. I haven't played it myself because my computer can't handle it, but I did love the original Sims so I'm sure this second one is also great. However, Maxis did not include the features most people wanted to experience in the video game systems like PS2. For example, the Sims cannot have children, or age, or build two story houses. So, who ever is planning to buy this game for such systems, just be aware that the only thing you do in Sims 2 is control the Sims lives. There AREN'T any children or anything like that."
3,Cool BUT Slow...,"Ok, I have the original Sims game for PC and I really got into it. It took up hours of my day and I liked every little thing about it and what it offered. So, when I picked up the Sims 2, u can imagine I was excited. Well, that was until I brought the stupid thing home and stuck it in the computer. It's slow, it's a VERY....SLOW...game. And my computer is partially to blame. It's a windows me, so it sucks that it runs slow, because I really was looking forward to playing the game. And the sad part was that I got it for Christmas and paid $50 for absolutely nothing. And unfortunately now, can't take it back, so what to do with a game that doesn't work??? Well, that's my review. Buy it if you're rich and have some fancy expensive computer to play it on and all that good stuff......Else wise, it'll run as slow as a slug."
2,Very disappointing!,There have been tons of problems with the release of this game. A lot of people have had MAJOR crashing/freezing problems. So beware.......I think they are working on a patch....you might want to wait until they get all the kinks out of this one....
4,"No review, but need to rant","I know this will be a great game, BUT.I pre-ordered this game on Nov,9 2003. Yes that date is correct. The day they started taking pre-orders. And they are now tellin me the date I will get it will be Oct 22. Over a month after it comes out. The page selling the game says ships within 24 hours. This is wrong on so many levels. The whole point of me -pre-ordering the game, see above 11-9-03, was to get is as soon as it comes out. I even had next day air for shipping.I've never had a problem with Amazon before, but maybe they are getting too big for thier britches. If nothing new by Thursday my 10 month pre-order lol will be canceled."
1,"bad game, didn't work","I ordered this game first of all because it was used and cheaper. But what good is that if the game doesn't work. It said it was like new. Very good. Well, good luck, it wouldn't load. I tried all methods known. Nothing. I even tried it on two different computers. Nothing. Same results. My son-in-law told me never to buy a used game again. So, I will follow his advice. I'm sure no harm was ment, but this was a bad product. THey did accept my return which was good."
4,Can't Wait,"I only found out about the Sims2 on Monday and am already filled with anticipation for it to come out. I have read many reviews and info, and have seen hundreds of screenshots.I heard that there will be twins and triplets and that the simmums will get a few days off work to look after the babies.This game is going to be 1000 times better than the 1st one and I cannot wait."
1,EA games has very unfriendly customer service,"Just so you know, if you buy this game (or any other EA game) for your children, you cannot make a back-up copy of the game. And if your child happens to scratch the disk (which, seeing as they are kids, is a possibility), it'll cost you a ridiculous $13 to replace it.This happened to me. The people I spoke to at EA games were extremely unfriendly. When I asked why it was so expensive to replace 1 CD, I was told that they are charging me for the software again (even though I already paid for that when I bought the game originally).Apparently it is their 'company policy' to rip off their customers.After I was told this by a 'warranty person', I called again to speak to an operator.The operator I had on the phone refused to put me through to someone who could take down a complaint, and actually hung up on me!"
1,Useless Game,"This game (DVD Version) was a gift from my Husband, for my Birthday. I was so happy to receive it, I tried it right away. Well, after trying for a half an hour, I realized that it was NOT going to work on my computer (Windows ME),...which Does have a DVD player, so that was not the problem. What was the problem, I don't know, & I don't really care. I'm grateful that my Husband got his money back, but still very disappointed that I have to miss out on what looks like a fun game, because the game is too complicated for the computer I have. IT'S JUST A GAME! Why not make it simple enough for everyone to enjoy,...that makes for good business, also."
1,Victim of marketing,"This could have been the best game in HISTORY. Really. But the guys at EA just had to ruin it.They make up completely the min. requirements, so everyone will buy it, but only 1 out of 7 will be able to play it.They reduce the objects, careers, furniture, walls, floors, etc to a skeleton minimium, to force the user to buy expansion packs.They make sure there is nothing new except 4th floors & aging, and make 1000 expansion packs, to make most money out of the game.I undestand if they want to make money, otherwise they wouldn't have created EA in the first place, but this is crossing the limit. Make a succesful game, then release 1000 expansion packs, upgrade the original to 3D, and release the 1000 exp packs again so all the parents are forced to buy the same thing twice.To sum it up, this game is just the original with better graphics. Save your money for something else."
3,Wont even install!!!,I am a huge sims fanatic! I finally bought a computer for the sole purpose of the sims 2. When I tried to install the game however it just froze up at 23%. I tried over and over again to install and still nothing. I finally recieved some advice from dell that I need a high end video card to play the game!! I am very shocked because my computer is brand new but it won't support this game. It is very dissapointing because I really want to play it but now I have to spend at least $60 for a video card. Make sure your computer has a ati radeon 7200 or nvidia geforce2 or greater video card before buying!!!!
5,"WHERE,WHEN,AND WHY???","I love the sims but i am getting mad can someone please tell me what is ea or maxis e-mail here is one of the big ? that i have if you can awnser this please do......1.When is the game really going to come out?LaST night i was on the computer and the date was agust 31 and now it is september 17 or something so please tell me where is the game really coming out?If the date is going down so should the price!!!!!!!I am having surgery agust 1 and i was really looking forward to this but now the THREEE!! months i will be in bed i wont have anything so maxis,ea,amazon what ever one is changing the date THANKS ALOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Best Game Ever,"If you love the Sims Series, then you will LOVE this game 2x as much you loved the old ones."
2,really disappointed,"The girlfriend loves the SIMS, so I bought the sequel early as a present. It is very slow loading, slowest game I've ever seen, and my comp is not that old or slow (3.2Ghz) Gameplay is clumsy, navigation is clumsier... It's like a bad first person shooter from the mid-90's... maybe it will grow on me over time, but first impression is very poor.Nothing like the SIMS, big step backward."
2,Caveat emptor!,"Buyer beware is the message here. I absolutely love this game and am totally addicted to it but be forewarned it is FULL of bugs. There is a jumping bug that develops that makes your sims unable to interact with each other and objects without ""jumping out"" of them. This is happening to players after playing and working perfectly for awhile. If you go to a Sims message boards it is jammed full of people with this problem. It looks like it may be a long time before it is patched as well. This bug makes it impossible for some people to play the game. There are lots of people with the game on their shelves unable to play until a patch comes out."
1,Major Bug in the Sims 2,"Yes, I was hit by the jump bug, as are many many others who bought this game and now find it unplayable. Below is a link to the sims 2 bbs post that talks about this bug.(...)Let me repeat, this is a game breaker! The workaround from EA is only a complicated reset button for your family. In addition, the bug returns. Some people got it after only a week of playing. It hits your most played families and then spreads to the rest of the neighborhood. The bug causes you to not be able to share interests, woo hoo, hot tub, eat, watch tv or talk on the phone with other sims. If I were a consumer who knew about this ahead of time, I would have waited for the first patch to buy it, or I wouldn't have bought it at all."
3,Great Game! Drawback: Die too quickly!!!!!!!,I love this game............but........I can't help but be dissapointed that the sims live and die to quickly. You can't really advance careerwise unless you stop time by using the cheats I suppose. I just wish they would be adults longer.
2,Nice graphics but buggy,"The graphics are beautifully done and gameplay is deeper than Sims 1. Other than their needs, now Sims also have aspirations which players need to help them fulfill. Sims now have memory that grows as they grow older. That's when the problem kicks in. When you play a Sims after a period of time (around 2 weeks), they will get infected by the jump bug and make the game unplayable. The jump bug prevents your Sims from interacting with other Sims which totally put a halt to game advancement because that is what the Sims game is all about.Even though players have been complaining on the official site forums for almost a month now, there is totally no replies from Maxis. The game is an unfinished product and rushed to ship before deadline. DO NOT BUY this game until Maxis releases a patch to fix this serious bug. From past experience, I am worried that they might include a patch with their next expansions after afew months."
5,The Sims 2 ROCKS!!!],"Ok, for those of you who think there is a limited amount of stuff for the Sims 2, are DEAD wrong. This game has so much more. It's already like Sims 1, living large, and hot date all in one package. You play Sims 1 without those three expansions and let's see you compare this game again.It's so addictive. There is so much more to this game, from cutomizing more detail in the sims faces, as to picking out clothes, which you can make your own. I have done this many times already.You can start with a adult and a toddler, and watch the toddler grown into adulthood, while the adult still has some adult days in them.I LOVE this game, and am ready for The Sims university in march!There's So much more potiential to this game, than the Sims 1, which makes it more fun to play. :)"
3,Good game with some,"First, I must say something and get it out of the way. I LOVE THIS GAME!!! Maxis did a great job with the better graphics, more houses, and the three new neighborhoods. Unfortunately, this game requires a bit more than an on-board graphics card. The game needs over 4.0 GB to install and requires at least a Raedon 7000 graphics card to run, though this can be obtained easily, (...) If you have a good graphics card, get the game, it's worth it... If not, look for somewhere else to spend your money."
4,Sims 2,"It's a great game overall everything is better and new, cooking is a lot of fun when you can make things like spaghetti, meatloaf, tv dinner, stuff like that! The teenagers can get acne, there is homework for you to do. Aspiration awards are awesome! It's really easy to make money, but is was too on the regular sims. If you don't know the code to get money it's no longer rosebud ;; it's motherlode. Anyway your sims can get older, have three neighborhoods to choose from (you can create more if you want to) Strangetown, Veronaville, and Pleasantview. There are aliens, and getting abducted is cool. The makeup, the facial expressions, clothes all are up to you! I always want to play this game on weekends but can't because it keeps crashing, this computer is too old to play sims 2 on. But it's awesome anyway!"
3,woe for older computers,I really like this game! It is seriously addicting and entertaining. One fairly big problem... If you have a computer that is more than two or three years old this game is slower than three year old corn syrup. Im bummed. I want to play it all the time but it looks like Ill now be in the market for a computer upgrade after buying a $40 game! Ugh!
4,Total Awesomeness...,"this game rox. it's so much fun and your sims act much more like people. they are also smarter about their needs, which makes the game a lot easier. your sims will age, so they will eventually die, but there is a cheat to stop the aging process, but it's cool b/c it makes the game seem much more realistic.i noticed that some people are angry b/c if you make a really attractive sim, they won't be treated any differently. it would probably be a pain to add this to the game, and it would be encouraging relationships based on looks alone, which I think is wrong, but hey that's just me...the sims2 works just fine for me, though it will lag sometimes, but i think that the rest of the game makes it well worth it.*Have a Fabulous day!*"
4,Great Item,The item i received was in great condition. The only downfall is that the product is already registered on thesims2.com so I am unable to download items from the website.
5,classic game - great vendor,"...not much to say about TS2 that cannot be found already - it's the best selling game of all time and sells more copies than the operating system you are using- needless to say it's well-documented because it is hugely popular....however the vendor, Visionary Books, is really top-notch.-the game came exactly as described and it came quickly with order confirmations preceding shipping (i cannot stress enough how important it is to receive this one simple communication).-i have other orders i placed BEFORE this one from other vendors that i am still waiting on - but due to the high quality of the order, order confirmations, expediency and great recycled yet reusable packaging, i will make sure i order from them again if it is software or NON-DIGITAL books i am looking for (down with DIGITAL copy).-there you go- two thumbs up for game, quality, experience & vendor alike- aces all the way."
1,WARNING about this game,"Do NOT purchase this game if you have CD or DVD burning software installed; not even perfectly legal burning software. Maxis and EA Games appear to have decided not to allow customers to play their games if they have software they (Maxis and EA Games) don't approve of.If you do purchase this game and install it, you will discover when you try to launch it that you cannot play the game unless you uninstall various other software. There is no warning on the box about this conflict and Maxis has not publicized their approach to copy right protection for this game.Thankfully the store I purchased my game from took it back and refunded my money without any problems based on what Maxis and EA Games have done."
5,AWESOME! AMAZING!,"I LOVE this game already! (...)I am so impressed by the realistic details and custom effects. I can't wait until this game releases. I don't think I'll ever stop playing it. Also, they're going to be releasing I think 7 expansion packs just like The Sims 1. I can only imagine what pets will look like! I CAN'T WAIT! : )"
3,Sims 2 here i come!,"Ok i think Sims 2 is going to be the best thing EVER! For most of us sims fans we have always wondered or hoping of what isms may turn out when they are older. Some of us have Sims Makin' Magic, in the game there is a charm for kids to turn into an adult. But that can be bad because they end up as ugly sims and if it backfires they become a baby again. IN the new sims 2 your sims will be able to grow up! and when the are having kids it does show they are pregnat not daisys sournding the baby crib! more floors, more detail to your sims, new objects, get to make new objects, little kids will no longer get to sleep in tere parents bed (rumor that u can train them to sleep in which bed!), more jobs, more options! and more to come i just can't wait to get it!"
5,Sims 2,"This game will be the best PC Game of the year... there's no doubt about it, unfortunally I'll have to wait probably till Octuber or November to see this game down here, so for those who can and live in US you should buy this game as soon as you can 'cause this means tons of hours of FUN."
3,"It was pretty good, but not best...","The Sims 2 PC game was very enjoyable. It definitely kept me glued to the screen the first couple times I played it. I still like it a lot, but after a while you just get bored of the people's normal, same old lives so you end killing them for fun. If you are going to get Sims 2, make sure you also get the expansion packs, to make the game more interesting. The other downside of this game was that it sometimes slowed your computer down a lot because it used up a lot of the power. So because of this my parents uninstalled it on our PC. This is why I have rated the game 3 stars. With the expansion packs, it might be rated 4 stars. I sure hope this review will help you on making your decision about this purchase."
5,Just a note....,"As in a lot of the reviews on this website, i too preordered the game from amazon and got an expected ship date around october 20th. So i ordered it from gamestop.com, and it has already shipped and i should be getting it within the next few days(if not tomorrow, as the fedex website says for my package) I think amazon really messed up this one, even if the october ship date was an accident, they should have prevented it, they lost a lot of orders from that. I just wanted to say that gamestop.com did an excellent job, and i cant wait to get my game"
5,The Sims 2,"I think this game will recieve a 5 star rating! According to fan sites and etc, the game will be amazing! The Sims 2 is going to be the ultimate must have game of the year... (for those who are interested in the game} The only problem with this game is that once you have downloaded T.S.2, your other expansion packs, unleashed, superstar, makin' magic, etc, will be errased from the computers desktop, and will only enable you to play T.S.2. Still with all the misfits... this game is going to be the game everyone is talking about, if it comes out in time!:P For those who don't know the releasing date, it will be coming out either August 15th or August 30th. Hope for the best!"
2,What's the Deal?,"I've always been a big Sims fan. I remember reading last spring that the Sims 2 was coming out in December 2003. I was so excited and I couldn't wait! Then, a few months later, I read February 2004. A little disappointing, but I figured I could manage. Then, I heard it was going to be released in March. I bit down hard, but I can't do anything about letting them release it earlier. Now I hear JUNE?!?!? I know they have to work out everything, but this is insane!!! I have waited all I can and if they don't release it earlier than that, all of my excitement will run out (it's all ready dropped drastically) and I might not even buy it at all."
2,Could be an okay game,"It looks like it could be an awesome game-- which is why I give it two stars. However, it simply will not run. I installed it, and tried to play, but it took about 30 minutes to load, and then, when I started playing, it would cycle between freezing and un-freezing. none of the commands worked at all, and even the mouse would freeze. I hate this, because I want to play quite badly, but the stupid game won't let me. Also, I have a good computer that meets all of the game's specifications, with ample memory and all of the applications needed to run the software. I tried the troubleshooting, but it simply does not help. Don't waste your time, only to end up frustrated."
3,Disturbing and buggy.,"This game took three and a half hours to install on my computer. It kept crashing and we kept having to start the whole process all over again.Even though it is running smoothly now, it does still crash at random points such as when you're trying to place a lot.Also, glitches are common.As for the disturbingness, well.. The Wooyeah cutscenes aren't appropriate at all. I was really freaked out and my parents were, too.I wouldn't reccomend this game to anybody under fifteen."
1,It's not fair,"I spent $50 on this game, to get it, and find out that my hard drive wasn't compatible with DXSELECT or whatever it's called 9.0 and that I can either spend a couple hunderd dollars on a new driver or not play at all. I DON'T HAVE THAT TYPE OF MONEY! My computer is only 2 years old, and I can't even play the game. This is cheep and I'm very upset."
2,"The game is fun, but it keeps crashing :(","The game plays fine, but sometimes it keeps crashing and freezing. I have to keep restarting my stupid computer. It's annoying! My specs are P4 2.66Ghz, 512MB, and Radeon 9800 Pro 128MB.I don't know why it keep crashing. My specs are high enough."
5,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! BY CARRIE,THIS IS THE BEST GAME OF ALL TIME!!!!!! I WAS SOO EXCITED TO HEAR THAT THE SIMS 2 WAS COMING OUT . I READ A LITTLE ABOUT ITAND WAS EVEN EXCITED THAT YOU COULD PUT THE WINDOWS DIAGONALLY.THE SIMS MAKIN MAGIC WAS A PRETTY BIG DISAPPONTMENT SO I DON'T REALLY RECOMMED YOU BUYING IT.the sims 26 stages of life. 4 stores including a basement and an attic:)the release date is not for sure it may be march 15 or feb 15.feb 15 would be best 4 me;)the latest update was january 8th 2004only 2 more months 2 go can u wait?NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i need sim 2 now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"When I was waiting for this game to come out I was really excited. I got caught up in all the cool screenshots and movies. When it came out I had to get it right away, but when I did I found that it was too similar to the first game.Pros:awesome graphicsnew wants and needs partmovie makerCons:Too similar to the old gametakes up a lot of space"
5,Great Game If You Buy Right Version,This game rocks only if you buy the right version. Dont get the dvd special edition if you dont have a dvd rom! Just some advice..
5,Difficult to install but found the answer,"I finally got the thing loaded. After several tries on two computers to get the cds to load past disk 3 I finally got smart and went to the support website. techsupport.ea.comNormally I don't bother because these tech support sites tend to be worthless. But not the EA support. I was impressed how quickly I found the answer I was looking for.It was actually a hint for loading an expansion pak but it worked for Sims 2 as well. I made a folder on my local C drive called Disk Images. In that folder I made 4 folders: disk1, disk2, disk3, disk4. Making sure no space was between the word and number. I put in each cd and cut and pasted them into each folder. Then I went to the disk1 folder and double clicked on autorun.exe. It installed all four folders in no time.Great graphics although the houses at night are very dark without buying a lot of lamps. But I haven't played it much yet."
2,Slowwwwwwwww,"This game is awesome, and real fun, but the load time is LITERALLY unbareable. I don't like the fact it takes 30 minutes to create a family and then take 3 minutes to load everytime you try to load something and then go as slow as heck when playing. Unimpressive, . Ruins a game if you can't get anywhere with even a reasonable amount of load time"
4,Sims 2: I Can't Wait!,"Well, what do you want me to say? We all know that this will be a fabulous game and it's a dream come true for me. This will be great. There are just some things I'm not sure of; for instance, will my computer be the right type because it will probably be too slow for this game. Some people tell me that it's going to take up a lot of memory from other places and may not work well...I wish someone would explain this to not just me but everyone. If this game isn't a hog then it's the miricle game. Well that's about all I have to say. (sorry for my misspelling)"
1,Wait....FAR TOO LONG,"Maxis needs to stop with the BS and just come out with the game. They make enough money i think it should be done by now, and be perfect. This is American economics at work, make someone want something then make it impossible to reach...."
5,The Best Game Ever!!,"This the best game i ever played in my life. Ever since it started I bought all them, and there all worth the money. I start playing in the morning and never get off until night, there that good."
1,Crashes Alot,Although it has added features over Sims Deluxe. It does crash quite frequently. I hate that a child has to be related to a parent. I have a better time playing Sims Deluxe then this. Also the game moves at a snails pace.
3,Good,"I love how you can actually design your person from head to toe in The Sims 2. I still think, with every expansion pack, the regular Sims is the best. Also The Sims 2 takes up a TON of space on your computer, a lot more than the original..with all of its expansion packs.I have it installed right now, and I don't have enough space on my computer to install another small game. But it still is a good game. 3 stars."
5,Great!!,"If you enjoyed The Sims 1, than you should really enjoy The Sims 2! The graphics are awesome and there are so many camera angles that you can do. You can create unique Sims from doing their personality,make-up,clothes,etc. Also in the Sims 2, your Sims now age as well and they also die too. Overall, you should enjoy it if your computer meets the requirements for the game!"
5,1GB Muvo Tx MP3 Playe,"My wife does not like the menu system where the MP3 ID tags are read and used to select songs and create playlists. She much prefers this unit's simple style of creating folders via an Explorer Window. When her first Creative MP3 player died (after ALOT of usage), I replaced it with a competitor's product and she hatd it. She is so GLAD to be back with this unit's menu system. She loves the player and takes it everywhere with her!"
2,Died after 8 months....,"I bought the Muvo TX 1 gig on Sept. 7th 2007; it simply died on May 1st, 2008 - less than 8 months... this REALLY sucks. I liked this player, and used it daily for about an hour. It generally ran about 12 hours on a AAA Battery, which was OK, and it was easy to use... But to have it die on me for no visible reason doesn't make sense, other than it's not well made. I didn't drop it, bang it against anything, douse it in water - it just simply stopped working. I won't be buying any more Creative products anytime soon, time to try another brand."
4,MP3 Player perfect for me,"This MP3 is small, has FM, and serves as a flash drive so it doesn't need wires to connect to a PC. Perfectly suits my needs.I gave it only a four because it did not connect to the pc directly out of the package and the instructions didn't help. It took me a while to get it to connect. But now it works perfectly."
1,Be Aware! You will regret just when you open the box!,"I needed a voice recorder with portability and usb flash.I read almost all reviews before I made a decision.After a few tests, I couldn't agree with the positive reviews here.This product can be used as a usb flash drive. But if you want to expect a nice mp3 player that can record voices and play it back, you will definitely be disappointed.I tried to return this product after a few tests. Unlike this seller's pledge like ""buy with confidence,"" this merchandiser does not allow a return of any opened item.I really hope no one gets frustration by purchasing this useless junkie from this vendor."
1,Loses air & I can't get a refund!,"This product would be great if it held the air inside. Ours developed a leak not long after purchase, and due to the construction, we can't locate the leak to patch it! Eddie Bauer customer service referred me to the Target site, where it says ""This item cannot be returned to a Target store; find out how to return this item to Target,"" which is a dead end since it wasn't an online purchase!"
2,Not the best,"I found this mattress to be somewhat lumpy and uncomfortable. It inflates in a checkerboard of air pockets instead of inflating uniformly to provide even support. Uninflated it's a little bulky as well, although the attached wrap-around straps help make it easier to carry. I'd recommend a Thermarest or something else that may be more expensive, but worth it for a good night's sleep outdoors."
2,Eddie Bauer Sleeping Pad,"I got this off Ebay from a guy there that made it sound like this was a decent mattress. Well, when I got it I was shocked at the size of it! I didn't expect such a LARGE item! I'm a backpacker and weight is a HUGE issue. Weighing in at 5 BULKY pounds, I wasn't too impressed with it. However, after struggling to get it to fit on the bottom of my backpack, at the end of my hike, I was happy to have it to sleep on. No leaks (and I've had it for over a year), even after blowing into the valves for extra comfort. For the most part, it's a decent pad, .. if you can handle the 5 lbs of weight it adds to your pack."
1,Lasted only 6 nights of use before developing a hole,"We slept on ours a total of 5 nights camping and one night (for a guest in the house) before the thing developed a leak. Unlike other reviewers, I was able to find the leak - a half-inch tear in the bottom. No idea how that happened.But bottom line - this thing stinks. As many other reviewers here found, it is about as durable as a balloon. Don't buy it!"
1,Poor balance...,"The balls came timely and were as shown, but have a hard nut-like center and wobble in the air around it.They do not rebound from my hand in the same manner from time to time.They are made in China."
3,I'm guessing not the world's best,"They look like they're sturdily made, and the material looks to be strong and easy to wash. They're just a little light for my taste. Although it you'd like a little more hang time, this might be good for you."
4,nice set,"The balls were well-formed and solid. The only thing is I would have preferred them to be slightly smaller, but they are still okay."
4,fun for all,I bought these as a gift (the kids to Dad). Dad says they are nicely weighted and are well made. For the price they make the kids laugh and Dad gets to entertain the troop for a while...giving me a break! worth it.
1,Too small and not weighted the same,These balls are much smaller than you'd expect. They are too light and one is lighter than the other two. Bad for juggling.
2,They are half the size of standard Juggling balls,"Quality is just OK, but, size is small and the weight is light...so, balls keep flying higher and away if you are new..."
3,alright,Well the juggling balls are to small and to light so that makes it a lot harder to juggle. they are well made and probably won't fall apart for many years. The fact that they are small makes it easer to catch them. I find that when juggling it is much easer to use bigger balls. I learned on bigger juggling balls which is far superior.
3,Juggling ball set,"Good for learning but its easy to break if it hits the ground to hard (product is tought, but not weak either)."
1,WARNING,"Do not buy this camera if you have a Dell computer. It doesn't say anywhere in the specs but this camera won't work with a Dell computer, and you can only use it if you pay $100 to Dell to get them to send you a driver that will work with the camera."
2,Driver is a headache,"The camera is good enough for the price I paid. After moving for a new location, I didn't find the CD for Windows XP. Trying to get the driver was a headache. Actually, I never found it! Fortunately, I found my CD after 3 weeks. Moreover, this camera does not work with Windows Vista, and of course, I know I won't find a driver for Vista"
3,Good for it's cost...,"Godo camera for the low cost. Doesn't have any problems with working. Self-powered by computer and USB cable is great. Does tend to be kind of orange tinged at times. Not completely awesome, but good and sturdy webcam for someone on a budget."
3,Good reference to coal mining disasters.,"This book is an accurate accounting of the lives lost by coal miners in the line of duty. One of the particular incidents in the book refers to my Grandfather who died as a foreman in the Pursglove mine. He was presented the Carnegy Metal for his attempt to save other trapped miners. This book is a good reference, but it could have a little more details to be an excellent book. Mr. Lacy Dillon also wrote another book ""They died in the Darkness"" which covers other disasters not in this one. Another of his books, ""I'll Remember You in the Morning"", a fictional writting is very good to give the reader the feeling of the times when these disasters took place."
3,Back Inside Cover,"After college education, the author taught school in the mining town of Glen Rogers, West Virginia. His family lived on a farm below the camp. During these years four major mine disasters happened at this one operation. At other times news of such tragedies in this mountain state made top news stories. After his retirement as a teacher, principal, and supervisor, he started research in the State Department of History and Archives, gathering information from old newspapers, and the records of the State Department of Mines. A result was his first book, They Died in the Darkness and a sequel, this volume They Died for King Coal. The latter volume tells such spectacular incidents as Barracksville, Sardis, Cinderella, and Blacksville mine fires; plus the explosions on Tug River, and others. Runaway man trips, skip fall, and a mine flood are other mine tragedies told in this volume."
4,Prepare For The Worst - Recommended,"We bought both the two-story and three-story versions of this Kidde ""Fire Escape Ladder"" since we live in an older house with only one way down from the upper floors. This is a ""One Time"" use item, so there is no real way to fully test it, but it is important to take it out of the shipping box to remove all of cardboard and plastic so it will be ready for a real emergency. It is also import to read the directions and ensure that the hooks fit your windows correctly before you need it!The quality is about what I expected, being fairly lightweight but well made. I would not want to use one of these ladders recreationally since they likely would not hold up with repeated usage, but have confidence that it will perform adequately if needed.These might not be for everyone since they can't be tested in advance, which would have been an issue for me when my kids were younger, but they meet my current needs.Recommended!CFH"
4,Good Product,"My law office in on the second floor of a building built over 100 years ago, long before modern fire codes. I wanted this fire escape ladder as there is only 1 exit and I was concerned that in case of fire that 1 exit might be blocked. This ladder addresses my concerns and is reasonably priced and has decent quality. However, like other reviewers, I am disappointed it is designed for 1 time use only, as this prevents us from actually testing it. Since I bought this ladder with knowledge from other reviews that it was 1 time use only, I cannot really complain. However, I did deduct 1 star. 4 stars from me."
2,Misleading,"Be careful before you purchase this item! Make sure it is EXACTLY what you want/need. It is basically a one-time use, so you can never install it or set it up just for practice or even to see how it works. Not a pleasant thought - the first time you use it will be when you need it because of a fire in your house, and you have to figure it out then??!! Outrageous."
4,Seems like a good product,The product seems to be made well enough that it would work fine should it be needed. The instructions are printed right on the product and are printed clearly.
5,2 story fire escape,The Kidde KL- 2S fire escape ladder is well built and well organized that in case of a fire you could easily unfold the ladder to escape your home
3,"Single use only AND a ""best before"" date...?","First off... ignore the stars. I'm not sure how to rate something I've never actually used, so I picked a middle of the road rating (3 stars).I bought this from my local Home Depot. I was suprised to find it's ""single use only"", but I assumed that maybe that's normal for these products.... it turns out that it's not. Or, if it is, other manufacturers aren't as forthcoming about it as Kidde. I was even more surprised to read the owners manual and find out the product has a 15-year ""best before"" date, after which the strength of the product degrades.I've got nothing against this ladder, per se. It may be a fine ladder. But I don't see a reason why I should buy one with these restrictions when I can find others ([...]) without them for comparable prices. I'll be returning my Kidde."
3,Ladder for fire escape,"glad to have this on hand for an emergency, however, once you open it, it does not close all the way back up, so we are unable to ""practice"" using this. I was a little disappointed with that as I figure we would need to know how to use it BEFORE an emergency."
2,Kidde Two-story Fire Escape Ladder,"All potential consumers need to know this product is a ""one time use only"" ladder. No practice runs allowed. I did not know this when I purchased it and returned it due to that fact. I wanted a ladder we could practice on and have on hand in an emergency."
1,kidde is bad news!!,It is simple..... Kidde is bad news all around. there are too many good ladders out there to buy from crooks.
3,kidde 25' ladder,have not removed product from the box since it says it is one time use. am hopeful that it will work if ever needed.
3,Pretty good but still kinda scary,"The ladder is designed to hang over a windowsill and prop itself against an outside wall. It looks like it would be very stable and reliable this way. Unfortunately we don't have windows that open, so our 3rd storey egress is off a balcony (no wall to prop on). It will not be easy to get onto the ladder this way and it will swing and twist as you descend, but it's still a lot better than nothing. I'd rather slide down a rope though."
1,the instructions say it all,"the instructions say that you can not use it more than once, which makes it even rolling it out the window useless. Just to practice and show how to use it will render the product useless according to the instructions. Either the instructions are wrong or the product is useless."
1,Read the package,"I have returned this package because the box labelling indicated that after the ladder is used for the first time, then it must be discarded because additional use may cause death or injury. Also the instructions indicated an adult needs to come out and stabalize the ladder before any children use the ladder. How are we supposed to practice a fire escape plan if we have to order a new ladder after every practice? Also, the children may need to go out without any parents providing stabalizing support. This ladder should be not be sold if after every practice, we have to order a new one. That costs too much money."
1,"Buy the original, not the rip-off","After I purchased this item, I found out that Kidde ripped off the design for this product(down to the picture of mom and pop on the packaging) from a mom and pop company named ""X-IT"" and so I have returned it.X-IT sued and won damages from Kidde, but apparently the judgment did not include any method of restraining Kidde from continuing to sell their rip-off design."
2,Can't be tested,Please be sure you understand that this product can not be tested before use. It is a ONE TIME use only safety device. Kind of ironic since all professionals recommend testing your escape plan ahead of time. Think about what you are going to do as young children are afraid to go down it in their panic. Can you carry them and descend?I suspect the manufacturer is concerned about liability if the ladder is damaged and reused so they put their bottom line ahead of your families safety. Too bad.
3,Review of Kidde 25-Foor Fire Escape Ladder,"I purchased this fire escape ladder as a scondary means of escape for my son in his first apartment. My son took the ladder out of the box and was a little dismayed to read that the ladder is considered a one-use product. He had extended a few feet of the ladder just to become familiar with it and realized the reason it states that the ladder is a one-use item - you need to pay particular attention to refolding and keeping the ladder untangled so in an emergency, it will drop down and open up completely for a safe escape from an upper level window."
1,"good item, but could be SO much better...","Unfortunately, when my husband purchased two of these, he did not realize that this model is a one time use only item. The first thing we wanted to do when we received our ladders was to have our three children practice using them to climb down from their 2nd story windows. Well, that didn't happen since there is no way for us to fold them up and use them again. Now we have to figure out something else to get that is more practical and can be used to practice with, not just in an emergency situation. While a very useful and important thing to have in case of an emergency...this was a disappointment."
1,Kidde KL-2S fire ladder-hard to use,It's hard to use and deforms quickly. I tried to use it for a practice so that we can handle it during crisis. But the ladder was bent out of shape very quickly. Not good quality.
2,poor packaging,"Thanks to another review that advised opening before the emergency might happen. The packaging is terrible. The ladder is wrapped in plastic and you'd have to read the directions to figure out how to use it. In an emergency, it's just too much. I bought another ladder a few years ago for my oldest daughter going to college. It was packaged to open and put directly in the window. This one, you have to slide out of the box, pull off all the plastic and then figure out which piece goes where. not good in an emergency. I've re-boxed it with labels to make use easier."
2,not for wide sills,I purchased this to fit in a window that has a 15 inch sill. The unit will not go that wide and did not meet my needs despite being a well made product.
4,Kidde LS-2S Two-Story Fire Escape Ladder,"I hope I never have to use this product, but given how cheaply this can be purchased it's crazy to not have at least one fire escape ladder in the house. The directions are clear and the ladder is packaged for easy deployment."
4,Safety,"Safety first..Great Item.. Every 2 story home or more needs one for safety reasons..Don't know if it works right,but then safety has no value. Will but more,Makes nice Christmas presents as well..."
1,a copy that does not allow safe practice,"buy the award winning x-it ladder -X-IT Products AL-15 2-Story Emergency Escape Ladderthis ladder is a copy that only fits certain walls, is heavy/bulky & does not allow safe practice."
3,Kidde KL-2S Two Story Fire Escape Ladder,"Per other reviews make sure you take it out of the packing before you need to use it. It is a one time use ""Emergency"" ladder so no trials are allowed. My first impression is that it is flimsy and in the event of an actual fire I hope it does what it is supposed to do. The hooks that attach to the window frame/structure seem rather ""shaky"". I guess if I had to use it it would be better than jumping out of the window. Trying to get out of the window and onto this ladder will be a chore for all but the youngest and most flexible. The best idea is to have working smoke detectors, plan a route in case of fire and hope you never have to use the ladder. The purchase price is cheap insurance in case you need it."
1,LADDER HELP,"I do not like this product. I find it very confusing and if a fire were to happen I believe I would have a better chance at jumping than to go down this bumbling tangled-up contraption.If I were able to fit it back in the box, I would certainly send it back.I give it 2 thumbs down.Ver disappointed buyer."
2,1 time use only,"It obviously makes sense that this would be used one time ... HOWEVER, i wish it would have been made a little more apparent before buying as we were wanting to run fire drills at my house so that we could be prepared."
4,kidde has good quality,"I believed in the product itself because the name of it, buying them when it's on slae/"
3,Not always the right choice,"This ladder, while light weight, might leave some users queasy, particularly if their second story window is not part of a sheer wall. Without support against the lower rungs, it's an e-ticket ride."
4,Seems like a fine product...,It looks sturdy enough and seems easy enough to use. I'll second (or third) some of the other reviews on here and reiterate that it's imperative that you open the box and remove the interior packaging off the ladder. If you try to do this in a life or death situation... well... let's just say take care of it when you receive it and put it back in the box ready to go.
4,A Necessity,"According to my son, the Fireman, this product is a necessity in every multi-level home. He told me what type to purchase, and we found it available on Amazon. So both myself and my daughter's family have purchased it.Hopefully, we may never have to use it, but it is better to be safe than sorry!Especially since it is not very expensive."
3,Escape ladder,"I bought this for my grandson, whose bedroom is on the second floor of their home. He has never had an occasion to use it, for which I'm grateful, but I wanted him to have access to this device if it was needed."
4,Three Story Fire Escape Ladder - Good Price,Looks just like pictured. We could not find a three-story ladder in stores; purchased it here instead for a good price (compared to two-story in stores). I hope we never have to use it.
1,poor hook design,"I purchased one of these.The attachment hook is a very poor design it may not work on your window. My window is a standard vertical slider in a 2 x 4 wall with vinyl siding and 3/8"" thick interior trim board.The ladder part looks great, but when testing the hooks over the window I was appalled to discover that all the weight of the person on the ladder would be pulling up on the tiny part of the hook that happens to hook on the interior window trim.I pushed down on the ladder on the outside and the hood quickly popped off!No way would I climb down one of these! I will be returning it!I will be sending an email to the manufacturer"
2,Kidde Fire Escape,"I was disappointed when the fire escape arrived because it is a ""use only once"" item and it didn't say that on the disciption. I bought it to practise on, and if I activate it to do so, I won't be able to close it up again for another time or storage."
3,5 year warranty,"As most of the other reviewers have stated, the box clearly mentions that this is a ONE time use ladder. But there is also mention of a 5 year limited warranty when you read the instruction manual. What good is a warranty if I can't determine if it's defective until I actually have to use it in an emergency??! And if it is defective, and I fall and get injured, I'm going to want more than just a ""new"" ladder. I can't actually say how well the ladder works since I'm forbidden to test it, but I bought it anyways just in case. The warranty makes no sense though, it's like they're mocking me."
3,Kidde Fire Escape Ladder 2 story 13 foot,I bought this so my grandchildren could be prepared in case of a fire in our home. Very disapponted that it could not be used so that the children could practice. This is a ONE USE ITEM.
4,Appears to be a quality product,"Thank goodness we have not had to use this ladder in an emergency, however, we did try the product by hanging the ladder out the second story window and had our 17 year old son (volunteer firefighter with the jr. explorers) climb down the ladder rather quickly without a problem. It did sway a little, and I know there is a product by Kidde that has a non-sway ladder also, which was more costly. Hope no one ever has to use it, but it is a must on a second floor."
5,escape ladder,"This was purchased for my daughter and her family. I hope it is never needed, but it's a small price to pay for a little extra piece of mind."
1,Can't trust it,"The ladder had scuff marks on it when I took it out of the box. Hmm... Was this a return? If so, why'd they send it back?More importantly, I tried it out and found it would not hook to the sill securely. It looked like it would slip off - I'm not putting my weight on THAT. Better to find that out when I'm checking it out, rather than when I REALLY need it.And the instructions were difficult to figure out, so I'm displeased with the putchase, and it's going back."
2,The ladder unfolded when I test it,"The product manual suggests to try two times to hand the ladder over your window without deploying it-- just to learn how to do in an emergency. Well, after I attached the assembly outside my window and tried to bring it back, it's unfurled. The release strap seems to be too narrow so that the entire folded ladder can slip through it. I did manage to pull the whole thing back into the room through the window and re-folded it, but they say it is for a single use only, so I am not sure how useful it is now."
3,More information would have been helpful,"It's impossible to know the quality of the product as it is a single use item. I didn't realize this when I purchased two for my home. They are here now, and as with all emergency equipment, we hope to never have to test them, but it certainly would be nice to do a test run."
1,one time use,"My children's bedrooms are all upstairs. I thought I would be able to practice escaping from the upstairs bedrooms with the kids. We started to practice fire drills 2x a month. However, the ladder is a one time use only :( I didn't notice until I recieved the ladder in the mail and saw the warning in small print on the box."
1,Not what we expected,"Didn't even open the box. It was clearly labeled, ""For one time use ONLY."" With children in my son's house, we were afraid to use this. If they tried a practice test, is that the one time? Unfortunarly, we returned it."
2,Only good once!,"Seems a bit flimsy, not sure how comfortable I'll be if I have to actually use it. Directions say only good for one use. If that's the case, it should say so in the description. It also means I can't try it out to be sure everyone in my family can use it OK so we aren't trying to figure it out while a fire is raging around us. I had another one years ago that was much better built than this one. We were able to test it and be sure we could do it in case of an emergency."
3,one time rodeo,"I wanted my daughters to practice escape with this ladder, but it is just a one use ladder. Bummer"
2,One-time only use ladder!,Why did it not say immediately that this ladder was for one-time only use? That should be part of the minimal description for this product. While I am glad I purchased it for the peace of mind--and hope I never have to use it that one time--nevertheless others should know this is not a product they can practice on.
4,Better safe than sorry,"I bought this as a gift, because it is something anyone living in a multi-story house will appreciate if the need ever arises, yet rarely buys for oneself. I'd have bought one for all my family, but only one lives in a two-storey house."
1,Sent it Back!,"The HM 5700 failed to produce any noticable mist, even on the HI setting. After waiting for twenty minutes at their ""customer service"" 800# (still no mist), I was told I should return it to Holmes with a ... check to cover their postage! Thank goodness for Amazon's excellent return policy.Pick another. I will!"
2,Needs improvement,"This worked well for one season then leaked water everywhere. The water shorted out the controls - was lucky there wasn't a fire. It never worked the same again. I gave it two stars because when it did work, it kept the humidity at a comfortable level. If I buy a digital humidifier, I'd look for one with the controls anywhere but under the water supply."
2,"Great potential, but had many flaws","We are currently on our second of this same model and we have had numerous problems with them both. While this vaporizer did work well over a short period of time it does have a few serious problems. First it's difficult to clean and often get's neglected, the large carrying handle on the bottom of the tank breaks off every time after about a year of use, the digital controls start malfunctioning about the same time as the broken handle making the unit completely useless or leaves it doing strange things and displaying weird characters, they leak water into the controls causing it to short out with loud internal sparks. We love this unit if only it would keep working for more than a year!"
2,Works well but brakes often,"I have bought this humidifier ... twice. It works well, but with proper maintainence the electronic control panel broke. I sent it back to the company and got a brand new one in return. I used it in the same manner, and now the new one's control pannel is not working. I would suggest finding another humidifier."
1,Watch out if you own this,"This thing got burnt the other day.Cooked!! I got lucky it just left the hole in my carpet, but it could burnt the whole house. By the way, it was working fine for last couple winters. I will never buy the warm mist humidifier again.... period!!"
4,This product has allowed me,This product has allowed me to have very good benefits and comfort in my work. I recommend it.
1,Advertising???,"I consider displaying advertising on my screen very invasive. Even if it's a good program this ""feature"" will keep it off my computer, as the activation and spyware did last year. Such arrogance- Taxcut was not quite as good in advice dept last year, but adequate. ( I had used TT for 15 yrs)"
2,Administrator problem - new for 2003,"I had been a happy TurboTax Deluxe user for several years. This year, Intuit decided that a Windows 2000 user must have Administrator rights not only to install the program, but also to run it. This is new, and different, compared to using Quicken or Quickbooks or TurboTax 2002. Intuit customer service told me this is because of security -- but in fact, it forces you to make your system vulnerabvle. TT 2003 is the ONLY application I have which has made this stupid move. Be warned!"
1,Poor & getting worse,"I've used turbotax for the last 5 years & it has been getting worse & worse. This year it would totally disable my internet anytime I clicked on anything involving the internet INCLUDING internet setup! I tried customer service(chat line), at least that is what they call it, to no avail. If you want a nightmare, try to use their customer service. It might be better service if you pay the $19.95 they charge to actually talk to someone on the phone! Anyway, I returned the product & bought TaxCut. TaxCut is 1000% better. Absolutly no problems!!!! Good luck with TurboTax!"
1,"OK Product, worst support ever","Overall, the product is better than last year. I thought that I may have found a bug; need to verify. Speaking with a person costs $19.95. Their online chat service yields (after over an hour of waiting):Please wait while we find an agent to assist you...You have been connected to D. Prince.D. Prince: Hello Tim,how may I help you today?Currently experiencing network delays, one moment please....Currently experiencing network delays, one moment please....Currently experiencing network delays, one moment please....Currently experiencing network delays, one moment please....Connection closed due to network problems.The documentation is terrible, the support of non-trivial tax situations is weak (expected), and their website is appallingly hard to use to get support. If they are victims of their own success, the merciful thing to do is buy from a competitor.Which apparently I now have to do."
1,No more TurboTax for me!,"I used TurboTax Deluxe 2003 and was totally frustrated when I tried to e-file with IRS/NJ. TurboTax automatically adds a Form 8582 p1 error and tells you to get an update before you can e-file. Well, there is no update as of Feb. 3, 2004, so I am stuck with a useless tax program and a stack of paper that will have to be mailed in. As far as getting help from TurboTax or Inuit, forget it. Their customer service is non-existant. Needless to say, they advertise a free ($14.95) e-file to IRS which you cannot take advantage of since the e-file doesn't function."
2,Administrative Rights required to install AND USE,"As noted by another reviewer, you must have Administrative Rights both to install AND USE TurboTax Deluxe. No other software I have used is so restrictive. This is also contrary to advice given by Microsoft, that you should not access the Internet from an account with Administrative Rights because the security problems are much greater than when using an account with fewer rights. It also means only those with Administrative Rights can use TurboTax on your computer. You cannot put a short-cut to TurboTax on another user's desktop. That user will get a message saying ""In order to run TurboTax, you must have Administrative Rights."" Tech Support told me ""...you need to consult with your system vendor. He only can help you in this regard."""
1,Just don't buy it,"I bought a Turbo tax this year. Delux version. You have to download the state version. You need to call the customer service to get those two numbers in order to download it. They will ask your sys number ( randomly generate when you installed your software ). It will be ok if you just do one installation. If you have to install it on a different machine, or later on if you get audited, you need reinstall the same software on the same machine. It won't work because each install will generate a new sys number. The new sys number won't match the old sys number. So you will be in trouble. You can call customer service to get a number.So if you can just do one install, it is ok. If by any chance, you need to de-install the original copy and re-install it, you will get into trouble."
3,"Generally good, but BEWARE","THE GOOD: Decent user interface, logical flow, easy to move around between forms independently of the interview. Installs and e-filing have always worked fine for me.THE BAD: Form 6251 (alternative minimum tax) handling bug. TurboTax fails to include the form in your filing package if you turn out to owe no AMT, but do have one of the tax preference items that requires form 6251 to be prepared (such as private activity bond income - very common for folks who hold municipal bond mutual funds). Plan to receive a letter from the IRS if you are in this situation. Incredibly, the Intuit website blames the IRS for mistakenly sending out letters (I read the 1040 and 6251 instructions and it is very clear that this form is required) and tells you to ignore their request!THE UGLY: Support - forget about it. It's a joke. You have to pay $20 just to talk to someone even if the reason for your call is a bug in their application."
1,Turbotax is full of errors - beware!,"I work in New York, lived in NJ and then moved during 2003 to New York. Not that complicated. Turbotax had several blatant calculation errors and completely failed to fill in necessary worksheets for both state returns. Had I sent the return in as Turbotax prepared it, I would have certainly been audited. If you have a similar situation, beware. Triple check every form and be prepared to calculate everything on your own. This software is a complete waste of money. Well, the federal portion was fine, but don't trust the state software."
1,Security breach: Admin rights required,"As a PC technician, I have to be concerned with security. One of the biggest holes in the business environment is giving any user full rights to their computer. At home, most people install an operating system (Windows) and are not aware that they have these rights by default. TurboTax 2003 requires administrator rights (every right available) to the PC in order to run. This is an invitation for people to install remote programs, and then use them to ""hop"" around a network installing programs and downloading files on other PCs that the users, techs, RIAA, MPAA and administrators do not want. These programs are extremely hard to get rid of, which, can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in downtime and repairs. It's your call. I gave it a 1 (for fear of someone breaking in to the workstations) since it is the lowest I can."
1,Don't Buy It,"1. Although it allows for capital gains for the sale of many invetments, not raw land unless it was pruchased to produce income.2. It refused to print although I was eventually able to make it print.I used TurboTax before. Actually, not bad to use but unless it accounts for all income, it is worthless. email me at allenwine@yahoo.com if you can get it to consider the sale of raw land before the May change."
2,Intuit doesn't know how to write software,"I've used TurboTax for about 5 years now. In the past, I've really liked it but the product hasn't kept up with the times. They are still writing the exact same product they wrote for Windows95. This is 2003, Windows XP has been out for 3 years. TurboTax refuses to run except as an administrator which means you need to open yourself up to virus attacks to use it. It also refuses to save its files somewhere normal like My Documents but rather insists on saving them in Program Files. Uggh! TaxCut is looking better and better all the time."
1,why all the forms,"I got this garbage free but I wish I would have bought Taxcut. Intuit obviously has a lot of stock in ink munufacturers. For every return, it prints so-called worksheets that it recommends your keep. These worksheets add up to about 15 pages of unneeded printings. Ink aint free!! They should atleast have some way of disabling this option. I hate TurboTax!!!!"
1,Causes computer to freeze,"I have used TurboTax for 5 years and have never had any problems. I recommended it to a lot of people. I will never buy it again after this year. Whenever I try to update, it will sit there and do nothing. Then I end up having to reboot the computer to do anything else. I went to their ""tech support"" site. What a joke that is. I manually downloaded the update, still got the same problem while doing a return. They desperately need a telephone number you can call."
1,Stunning drop in quality,"There are serious problems with EasyStep, the way TurboTax takes you through filling in the information for the return. It is only because I'm knowledgeable about taxes and a software developer that i managed to get my return correct. And deviation from simply stepping through, one item after another, leads to trouble. Simply going back, using to back button, to change something can cause important screens to be skipped.It is a real disappointment. Intuit used to be one of the very best software companies.I certainly don't want to recommend that people by the Microsoft product. I'm sure one reason Intuit is letting quality drop is the price competition from the convicted monopolist.My suggestion is to use a tax preparer."
1,Buggy software,"The software had problems loading, so that it took hours to do something that should have taken minutes. And customer service was ZERO help. They were trying to get calls completed, not problems solved. This was one of my worst software experiences ever- and I've been in the software business for years."
3,one small problem,"love the program, support sucks! there appears to be a glitch in deluxe 2003...""show my return"" view does not list form 6251 even though the program filled out the form and it can be displayed by going to ""open a form"". the problem is that the form neither prints prior to e-filing nor does it get transmitted to the IRS. I got a letter from the IRS about 25 days after e-filing requesting a completed form 6251 and that's when I discovered this problem...called turbotax and a very nice Indian or Pakistani told me they would credit my card for the e-file fee and work on the problem. It is impossible to find out if this problem was unique to my copy of deluxe 2003 or if the program does not print or transmit form 6251 when no amt is due. It appears the IRS wants the form even if there is no AMT due. NO FEEDBACK FROM TECH SUPPORT...If form 6251 does not print with your copy do not e-file. Print the form by itself and mail with a printed 1040."
3,not ready on Jan 28; poor customer support,"I've used TurboTax for 5 years, and it worked OK. However, to complete taxes, software needs to be updated online, and final update does not come early. This year, again, TurboTax is not ready by the end of January (for example, Schedule K-1 is not supported yet). Intuit uses to promise update soon, but they do not fulfill it in time. You have to wait and wait. Customer support is not good. It is available over online chat. Do not believe when you see something like ""Current wait time: 5 minutes"" when starting chat - I waited 30 minutes instead.I cannot tell how this software compares to competitors."
1,Intuit is fast becoming a rip-off specialist...,"I swore I wouldn't buy this product again after last year's c-dilla/DRM debacle, but hey, I wanted to get my returns filed quickly, and they were offering a ""free"" state download. Heh, heh...when I tried to get my state download yesterday, the Intuit website informed me it wouldn't be available until January 20th. Today I got an e-mail from Intuit indicating it might not be available until mid-February. So much for filing right away. Apparently, Intuit is selling software it hasn't even released!!! Makes me wonder if I can trust the federal version This is a frustrating company, and I'm through with them (and this time I mean it...""fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice..."" -- well, you know how the saying goes.)"
2,Features reduced this year,"I have used TurboTax Deluxe for 5 yeats and generally found it okay. It's a tough proposition to write a program that makes sense of the crazy world that is the US tax system.For the 2003 tax year, Intuit has dumbed down TurboTax Deluxe. You can no longer get the program to figure out the tax savings you would get on different IRA contributions. Previous versions gave you excellent advice on how to minimize your taxes by maximizing your retirement contributions. If you click on that option in the menu, you get a message that it is only available in the PREMIER version!Sorry Intuit, I've had enough of your games (every year it seems to be something - last year it was spyware). Next year I'm going with TaxCut which is one third cheaper.Previous TurboTax users be aware that you are getting less this year."
1,Don't bother. It's a mess!,"I bought Turbo Tax Delux (includes state) then upgraded online to Premier Home and Business. I. I COULDN'T FILE ELECTRONICALLY SO WHY BOTHER TO USE IT!2.During the Deduction section, I clicked on Refinance (how many millions of us have done that this year?) and all it did was take me to the morgage companies I paid points to on my mortages. It asked me nothing about any fees on refinancing. 3. No sound on the videos. 4. Fonts won's install to print the form to go to the IRS. 5. I spent over 4 hours on chat and phone calls to tech support, when they admitted it was their problem. My third call was for a full refund of this unfinished POS product. They said they ""MAY"" have the problems worked out by the end of February. BFD. Won't help those of us who file early to beat the rush. I'm done with Intuit and their crappy overpriced products."
1,This is a Horrible Program,"I have used TaxCut in the past. This year, I thought I would give TurboTax a trial. It is absolutely a horrible program. The interview questions are confusing; the information you have entered are presented in a very unorganized manner. And you keep getting interrupted by advertisments during the interview. (Quicken just wants to keep selling you more junks!) It is just so annoying. In TaxCut, you can see in one clear view both of your Federal and State Return/Owes. Not in TurboTax. You have to switch to State return to see how much you get back or owe. Also, there is a HUGE bug. Once you've completed the State return, you CANNOT go back to interview questions and modify the details again. Everytime you go back, it will just tell you it doesn't find any error in your state return. I am never going to TurboTax ever again."
1,Constant Errors,"I have been using TurboTax Deluxe for several years now and this is the first time I ever had problems. Each time I try to update, it locks up my computer and crashes. I can not get it to update, but was able to manaully do it online. But, the state portion of it...I can not update it at all and now have to find an alternative way to file. The 2003 software is NOT recommended!"
1,Tax Cut Again for Us,"After using TTax since it came on a single floppy disk, I couldn't use it last year because of the DRM C-Dilla Spyware -- thankfully my anti-virus wouldn't let me load it. I considered using it again this year -- but you have to load it onto the C drive which is not acceptable for me. I have so little space there that I have to remove files to defrag the drive. I prefer the TTax interface to Tax Cut, but Tax Cut worked well for me last year, including importing TTax data. FYI: I successfully shorted Intuit stock last year because C-Dilla affected everyone, but don't plan to short it this year because the C drive issue doesn't affect everyone."
1,It Screwed Up!,"I work in NY and live in NJ. So I pay NY state taxes. TurboTax is suppose to fill in the NJ 1040 Schedule A Form and report this to NJ so I don't have to pay the NJ state taxes too. But it didn't do this, I had to manually override the forms myself and enter in all the data into the Schedule A, which I could've done by hand which would have been a lot faster since it took me about 3 hours to figure out how to get to the Schedule A and override it.If I wasn't aware of the Schedule A and the mistake that TurboTax made, I would've had to owe NJ about a thousand dollars! This is unacceptable, last year I used TaxCut and even though the interface wasn't as good as TurboTax, at least it did all my tax forms correctly. Next year it's bye, bye for TurboTax!"
1,Perturbo Tax,"My Turbo Tax Deluxe CD loaded well, and that's the last thing about it that is right. It needed 17 update files, and after 9 hours of trying I still don't have them all.Its download progress meters for updates mostly don't work.It won't import information from my 2002 Turbo Tax return.The ""Help Center"" might be of some help if I could get to it, but that won't display.Overall, it's a very poor product. Maybe its competitors are just as bad, but next year I'll learn about that!"
1,me too!,"OK I don't feel so bad now, I've used TT for 4 years and never again! Lousy customer service, buggy software (I still can't download the updates!)"
1,I'll Never Use Turbo Tax Again,"Even though Intuit claims they have listened to their customers on the issue of the included spyware DRM C-dilla (especially all the ones that have abandon them)I personally will not have anything to do with a company that stoops to the level that Intuit has with Turbo Tax. After researching and finding out more details about what Intuit has done, I have changed to Tax Cut which, quite frankly, is as good if not a better product (and costs less too). It has the added bonus of not installing spyware on your system."
2,news on update and filing problems,"Finally got answers to my problems. Many come from having a DSL connection.One Touch Updates: you have to close all programs for start up (run: msconfig)- uncheck all the boxes on the startup page except explorer (or other web connection) and turbotax, apply, and restart. Should be able to download. Don't forget to go back and reset the start up page, or many programs might not operate correctly!Troubles filing: comes from your DSL provider's settings. I don't have the full details, but I kept getting 3 error messages dealing with IRS network resetting, unsupported security, and another I can't remember. Anyway, after talking to support, I was able to send by using a dial-up connection - No Problems. I hope this helps, folks."
1,Poor customer service,"Simply put, my opinion is that Intuit is after my money and not my business. It is January 17th, their site says that the Federal update is available - I can't input my data without it and their tech support told me finally after some probing that the Federal update won't be ready until early February. I am highly disappointed because the whole idea of buying the software early is to get a running start on my taxes. Last Year we used Tax Cut instead of TurboTax, I regret going back to TurboTax. It won't happen again."
2,Problems with ttxctbti transfer program for 2002 returns,"It appears there is a bug in the program that imports taxcut 2002 data. There is a post on their website, that claims that the bug appears only with corrupted data. I have a perfectly fine 2002 file (tested on several computers and with 2002 software) and I was on the chat with their TechSupport for an hour. First they said they don't support Taxcut, but after me pointing out their claim to be able to import Taxcut and thus requesting a refund they said they will have fixed the import/transfer bug in a Mid January update. I hope they will keep their promise. If they fix this I would upgrade my rating.Bottomline: If you are planning to upload 2002 taxcut data I would not buy until after the update is out."
1,bad design-horrible custormer service,"So this is the second year I've use TurboTax. Year 2002 worked fine. This time I unwisely decided to file electronically for $12.00. I figured this was worth getting my refund quickly. The next morning TurboTax had stated my return was rejected by the IRS. I was to fix some ambiguous errors that Turbo Tax would not guide me through. Worst, the date TurboTax gave me to fix the problems had expired the same day I filed! I would now be charged $19.95 for a mistake TurboTax would not help me with. Worst still, there is no way to reach customer service without PAYING FOR IT!!! Thats right, it costs $19.95 to talk with customer service. This is discraceful. The only other choice is to use the chat engine, which I could not get to function. Save your money and pass on TurboTax."
5,best tax prep software,have used for many years now and find this software easy to follow and accurate in detail AND it allows for operator input on the forms if necessary........GREAT!
3,some comments,"I haven't purchased TT deluxe '03 yet. However I think there some misleading and/or incorrect user reviews on this product.- Schedule D is in fact included in the Deluxe version. I placed two web ""chat"" calls and both reps said it was included. I don't know to what extent it is integrated into the Interview process (or what the other reviewer's problems were)...- web ""chat"" calls: I had good experiences placing chat calls on two different days (noon EDT).- regarding the ability to import other product data & other ""problems"": yes, if TT claims it can import these files then they should fix this. But if TT is such a bad product why are you switching? Advertisements while you're using the product -- so what? Does it really interfere w/ your ability to use the product?-- just my $0.02..."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This products stinks. I am unable to download updates, and essentially the staff lies about the availability of updates. I have spent hours on Chats with technical support and it is USELESS. I am returning the product. Save money and Time. Don't buy the product."
1,"Use this software, and pay a penalty!","I live in one state and work in another. I used TurboTax Deluxe for tax year 2002. TurboTax is supposed to be able to perform multi-state tax returns. Unfortunately, the calculations that put a value in the ""Credit for taxes paid to other states"" didn't work properly and overstated the credits. One state audited the return, which resulted in a penalty + interest. Repeated contacts via voice and email to Intuit have not been returned. A bug report was submitted to Intuit which detailed the incorrect calculation formula and a calculation that should have been used, again with no response from Intuit. I will be looking for another source of tax software for my 2003 returns."
1,Their customer service is an impenetrable fortress,"Few days ago I bought TT deluxe. When I ran into a problem, I thought I would email them about the it. To my surprise I discovered that Intuit has very meticulously closed all possible ways of emailing them about any problem with turbotax -- they dont have a customer service email address, and they dont want you to reply to their emails. I decided to call their customer service. After waiting for a long time (much longer than their estimate) I gave up and decided to contact them through online chat. Their chat interface turned out to have bugs. After trying for an hour to bring up the chat window, and a further wait of 25 minutes, a rep came online. He promptly told me that because of a technical glitch he cannot address my issue, and I must contact them the next day. I said that I was very unhappy with the wait and the non-resolution. He said that he also feels ""depressed"" about it!"
1,A disappointment,"I didn't give TT a poor rating because it made a serious error on my taxes last year - it was on a very obscure point, and I don't imagine any tax software is free of error. Tne reasons are:1) When I told them about the error, in full detail, the only response I got was a form suggestion to check the FAQ.2) After I overrode the error, it kept using the wrong value in many places; for example, I paid a small penalty on state tax because I didn't notice in time that it imported its original incorrect value into the state form.They appear to be putting more energy into selling addons than making sure the basic product works. I'm off to a different program this year."
1,Substandard product and company,"After your forced to register the product on line to unlock it they download spyware into your computer. They remind you many times how you can store your information on their server, what's that about? While using the program you get bombarded with ads for other products, very irritating to deal with. ... I never did get my state tax program from turbo tax either like they promised."
1,Forced to switch in last minute,"First, importing data from financial institue doesn't work for me. I had to spend couple hours entering all my stock trade records. After that, learned that the interview/form for home sale was missing. TT said IRS doesn't have all the info disclosed when the software was released. Fine. Tried one-click update. Kept getting error messages. Tried on-line manual update download. Download didn't take too long, but it couldn't be installed. Finally gave up and contacted Intuit technical support and learned that it was a known issue, and they will inform me by email when they find a fix. I thought they were joking. Only a few days left before 4/15 and I'm not going to wait. Got to switch to something else ... maybe TaxACT ..."
2,My experience with Turbo Tax 2001 and 2002,"Turbo Tax 2002: Turbo Tax let Illinois users know that an error was in their program for those with out of state income. They sent a fix which corrected the problem for the 2002 returns. That was good. But, too late for me. I had already filed. I had to then file an amended return. After I got back several hundred extra dollars from my amended return I began to wonder about Turbo Tax 2001. I reviewed my 2001 turbo tax return and sure enough the same mistake was also there. However, I got nothing from Turbo Tax notifying me about the same problem being in their 2001 program. Had I not checked I would have not known."
1,Former TurboTax user finds happines with TaxCut,"I have been using TurboTax every year since the early 1990s.This year I tried TaxCut instead, and was pleasantly surprised that it was easier to use that TurboTax.After I did my return, my daughter did hers and made the same comment that TaxCut was easier to use than TurboTax.The reason I use tax prep software in the first place is to make tax time easier--and in my opinion, TaxCut is the most user-friendly way to do that."
1,TurboGarbage,"I've used this software for the last three years and have noticed the slide downhill. This is the worst version yet. It seems half of the features don't work (such as W-2 Import which locks up while ""Updating Partner Information""). The half that does work is terrible quality (the application is ridiculously slow and appears to be single-threaded).Thankfully I read the reviews early in the year and decided to wait until it was free after rebate. You know the software is trash if someone takes the time to complain about it after receiving it for free! Well, that or the someone who wrote this review has got some probs. hmm..."
1,Amen to the last 2 comments,"Though I didn't buy the program from Amazon this time, I came here to look for some feedback, and apparently I'm not the only one having problems. I wasn't able to get the thing to print properly either, even after the bug fix for fonts they suggested. I too, was cut off while trying to do chat. I wasn't about to pay another $20 either, which might or might not have helped. I'll probably be among the ranks next year who go with another product (there was one on the shelf next to this one for half the price)."
1,Garbage,"Do not buy Turbo Tax! I purchase TurboTax 2003 Deluxe and was ready to file electronically. Unfortunately TurboTax has not gotten approval from the IRS for several forms (forms 8582 and 8582 AMT) Since the IRS has not blessed TurboTax's forms, I can not file and I can not get my refund. I am being held hostage by their software. After getting kicked off their chat line support, I got through and was given the story that the update will not be available until mid-late February. After no follow up I have contacted the 888 customer service and have gone through the problem 3 times with various members. I have been hung up on 2x's with my only successful connect ending with them not sending me the fix instructions via email. For $80, the product and customer service is garbage and you are better off using the on-line IRS product."
5,Financial Nostradamus,"I read this book originally about four years ago. So much of the truth slapped me in the face that it changed my life and the way I looked at myself and my relationship to credit cards. I have never used credit in the same way since. I feel it promotes the credit card companies abuse of the American Consumer. I think he foretold the crash of 08 and the great recession.If you liked this book, I would also recommend the book ""Affluenza."" I am reading it now right after reading Credit Card Nation. I think it gives Free Market advocates a real one-two punch"
3,"IT'S BEAUTIFUL, BUT COULD BE IMPROVED","I agree with A. King's review on all points. Just one additional note about the water, you can (according to the product brochure) also use filtered water to prolong the life of the pump. I ordered before A. King's review was available, or I too would have chosen something else.The fountain pictured shows a ""bubbler"" effect at water level, but the tubing/fixed pipe on the solar plate is too tall, so even without the spray nozzle the black pipe protrudes above the water line about an inch. We cannot duplicate the effect as pictured on the product page. The water does evaporate quickly on warm days as the basin is shallow, so the solar pump needs to be removed or shielded if you are away for extended hours. The solar plate works well here even on our overcast days.Other than that, it is well constructed and the birds are enjoying their new water bath."
2,Copper Birdbath,"I wouldn't recommend this bird bath. I was very upset with the quality. The birdbath is too lite, the wind blows it over even with water in it. It must be refilled allot to keep the solor pump running. It was dented after the wind blew it over. It was not worth the money I paid. My husband threw it in the trash when we moved recently."
1,Sea Cure did not work,This product was purchased at the suggestion of our veterinary GI specialist for the treatment of our pet who has Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). We tried it for several days and stopped giving it to her because she had an averdion to it. We put the product in her Kibble (1 tsp.) and she would not eat her food so we stopped using it.
5,Even Better Than Expected,"My daughter recieved this as a gift from my sister last Christmas. She has enjoyed it so much. I was so impressed, that I bought it as a gift for my best friend's child this Christmas. This toy would be appropriate for very young children up to pre-k. I would reccomend this toy."
3,Incorrect age guideline,"I bought this toy for my 2-year old nephew, based only on the age guidelines. When I received the toy, I had to test it out. It seemed like a great learning tool, but a little advanced, so I looked at the box and I noticed that the manufacturer's recommendations said 3 yrs, not 24 months. Since he is a little slower in development I decided not to give it to him yet. I was very disappointed that the age recommendation was incorrect. I really don't know how to rate it, since it hasn't made it out of the box yet."
4,A good choice!!,My 4 yr old daughter received this for her birthday. She loves it and plays with it constantly! It is not overly annoying or too loud. It has been dropped and stepped on and still works perfectly. We are also still using the original batteries!! My daughter really enjoys the music/song feature. My 5-yr old son likes the phonics feature. A lot of toy for a good price and now I'm buying one for my Goddaughter!!
1,Awful. Overstimulating.,"This toy is terrible. It is very overstimulating. My toddler was made very crazy by it, and started crying. It was put away in the wardrobe, and when I tried to take it out a couple more times, the reaction was the same. Save your money and buy a children's book instead."
5,Haley and Hannah love it!,"My daughters love this apple. The youngest especially loves to push the buttons to hear music play. I have just one complaint. This toy pronounces several letters sounds incorrectly. As a teacher, this one aspect bugs me to death! For instance, R does not say ""RUH""."
1,It mumbles!,"The idea of this toy is great, but it's very hard to understand the audio. I bought it for my daughter but didn't give it to her because I thought it would confuse her more than it would help. I really don't recommend it!"
5,Wonderfully insightful,"Henry Nwokolo has managed in a refreshingly honest way to give us a book that reminds us what is important in this short life. His observations about life, love, and humanity are extremely insightful and quite enjoyable to read. This book also includes selections of poetry by the author that are a wonderful reflection of the book as a whole. Every page will make you think and re-evaluate what life is about, and how we can, if we only look for it, acheive a certain sense of peace in our lives. A most enjoyable journey of the heart, soul and the mind."
1,Just Opened Book to Glaring Error,"I picked the book up from curiosity; I am a Muslim. Did an 'open to' test and opened to the sixth page of the first chapter. Saw that in listing what Muslims believe he wrote that we must believe in ""Allah's Angels (Jinn)"". Yes, we must believe in Angels, and we do believe in Jinn, but these are completely different creations. Jinn live amongst us and like us have the gift/burden of free will. Angels only serve Allah and don't have will. If such a profound misunderstanding (and poor editing I must add) is in such a crucial and basic section early in the book, where can this book go when it delves into things less clear? The trash."
5,Shampoo/body wash,"This stuff is great for everyday. I have very sensitive and thin skin and this stuff doesn't make me itch after using it. Most soaps are too harsh for my skin and leave me dry and itchy. Using this stuff has greatly reduced any after bathing excessive dry skin. The shampoo part is ok, but you really have to use a conditioner after the shampoo to get a brush or comb thru your hair. Gets it clean, yes, just not tangle free.LOL!"
1,Simplistic...,"Having studied Jewish eschatology and as a thriller buff, I found this book a waste of time. The plot is bland, the writing not particularly inspiring and the conclusion predictable. There are two other Jewish Messianic thriller novels that I have read, which reach the same conclusion, but are better in every respect. They are The Promise of God, by David Shapiro and Samson's Lion by Alex Wolf. Shapiro's book was well written but lacked a little in the way of credibility. Wolf's Samson's Lion is way up there in most respects and quality-wise challenges a good Ludlum as a good read..."
5,Excellent!,I saw Zoe in concert at a little music festival in Donegal Ireland a few years ago and was blown away by both her fiddle playing on the traditional music and her violin expertise on classical. She's one of the best!
5,The Hawk and the Dove,"The first two books are told as stories passed down from a mother to her daughter. They concern an ancestor of theirs, Father Peregrine, the hawk who becomes a dove, the abbot of a monastery in the middle ages. In the third book, the mother/daughter framework is gone, but the uninterrupted narrative flows as the reader becomes a part of the story. This is not a book about religion, but about spiritual growth. The stories live, and give the reader opportunities for self-examination.I grew to love the characters as they discovered the truths of seeking the will of God."
3,Great idea - but broke after 1 month,"This mirror is a great idea, but the mirror surface is pretty small.Unfortunately, the mirror broke off from the hinge at the end of the telescoping arm after one month.Looking for a different alternative now."
2,Just the basics of consulting !,"The authors do a fine job examing the whys of pursuing consulting as a profession. Unfortunately, anyone with the slightest understanding of the world of business will inevitably skip too many chapters. The authors clearly have something to offer individuals who are considering entering this profession, its too bad they just scratched the surface. It would have been a much stronger resource with more examples, greater depth, and more attention to eliminating redundancies."
5,Not only for wanna be consultants,"I just recently read this book, years after I first bought it. Some things are outdated of course, like references to America Online and CompuServe, but some ideas are still timeless. Though I don't think I'm ready to become a consultant at this time, and I don't know if I ever will, the book is still useful for other things in life. Communication skills, like presenting, negotiating, and listening to others are always useful in all sorts of settings. If you want to start some other kind of business there are still some useful bits of information."
1,Should have consulted some aspiring consultants first,"What a disappointment. After a successful 30 year career, I needed advice on how to start working for myself. I already know my field, potential customers, how to set deadlines, do the work, be organized, and what services I can sell. What I don't know is anything about working for myself, out from under the umbrella of a large corporation. What do I need to know re taxes, licenses, permits, assets, depreciation. How to incorporate, anticipate and bill for incidental expenses, anticipate other legal and business needs. Note that it is already 8 years old. Books on business have a very limited life. If you are just dreaming of what it would take to be a consultant, then buy this book. Maybe you will find the authors tips and recommendations very profound. If you are already there, don't buy this book thinking it will answer any of your immediate questions on the mechanics of consulting -- it won't."
3,"Good for starters, but states the obvious","I bought this book because I was planning on going into consulting and read many good reviews only to be disappointed. I agree with fsb102 in that it states the obvious, things that common sense will tell you. For example: be organized, referrals are key, have prepared letters, be professional. Even what to include in the letters is basic.However, I do see how this can help someone completely new to business or consulting, especially someone that hasn't gone to college. It gives a basic understanding of what consulting is about."
3,What else did you expect?,"I've run into some rather useful book in the series ""For Dummies"" but this book almost does honor to its name! And, honestly, what could you expect from Bob Nelson, the author of the ""1001 Ways..."" series of books? This book is not terrible, actually, but it really doesn't go into much depth. There are better titles to assist you in your pursuit of a self-employed career in consulting (just a simple search of the term ""consulting"" in Amazon will list a host of them), if you want to go beyond a casual reading sitting at a Barnes and Noble or Border's store, which is what I did with this title, to draw the conclusion that I now share with you. Beginning consultants of the world: consult elsewhere is my piece of advice!Update: One place where you could look into is ""Getting Started in Consulting, Second Edition"" by Alan Weiss."
1,Defective,I marked one star because the tape was defective. Didn't even get to see it. It arrived with a part broken right off.
1,If you should ever have trouble...,"If you should ever have trouble sleeping just pop this audio in and you'll be out in no time. I don't really have any problems w/ historicals, but this bored me to tears! The main problem was that for must of the story the dialogue is unintelligible. Mainly the story is just to weak for four episodes."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I absolutely love the watch! Love the bracelet style band and the BIG face, keeps great time. I have been waiting for this watch to drop in price. Worth $60, would never have paid $95. Great watch for that wonderful lady in your life for Valentine's, Birthday or Mother's Day!"
1,Misleading,Please be aware that this purchase is for the Kaboose only! Not an Alphabet train. When we ordered this train we were under the impression that it was for an alphabet train. no where did it state that it was for the kaboose only. Very misleading!!
2,NOT ORIGINAL THEME SONGS!,"I did not like this CD and thought it was a waste of money. I wasn't able to listen to the songs and would not have purchased the cd if I had been able to (notice how the songs do not say who the artist is, this would have given away its ""cover"" quality). I do not believe these are the original theme songs to the show, as they all sound as if they are sung by the same person/band and are really just ""covers"" of the originals. I had hoped that the latest theme song would be on the CD (the one that is either sung by outkast or sounds as if it is sung by them...curiously one name of a song on this CD listed on the site sounded similar to this one which made me think it was on the CD but it was not). My son likes it unfortunately so I did not send it back. Don't buy it. It is just a marketing ploy to get money for a poor unoriginal product."
1,OMG!,It sounds like they hired some grunge rock high school band. It is AWFUL even my 4yr old twins wont listen to it..and they LOVE power rangers..dont buy it!
4,Assessing and using a variety of machines,"There is a bewildering array of woodworking machinery, and this book will help you figure out which machines you really need, and which are liable to sit idle and gather dust in your shop. What is the right way to adjust a jointer or thickness planer? This and a host of other questions are addressed by craftsmen in this collection of 40 articles from Fine Woodworking's classic black-and-white days. (This excerpt quoted from thr FWW site)."
4,Very helpful insights for parents,"This is the second book I have read on Dyslexia since my 8 year old daughter was diagnosed a few months ago. What I most appreciate about this book are the insights it provides into the emotional side of dyslexia for both the child and the parents. There is one chapter in particular with exercises to help parents understand the frustrations and anxieties their child experiences every day. Eye opening to think about, even if you don't actually do them. Written by a psychologist who is dyslexic himself, this book is an excellent companion to the books that focus on academic challenges and strategies. Although occasionally repetitive, I would definitely recommend this to other parents who want to better understand and support their dyslexic child."
3,Can't Hold Much Change!,"i needed a coin purse to take with me in case i used up all my rides on my metro card or needed a bottle of soda from a vending machine or piece of candy. this mini coin purse will only hold about 3 dollars in quarters,barely. and you don't want to force this zipper closed because it doesn't look very tough. nice for a few pennies and maybe a few folded up bills, but not if you need to carry $5 in change"
5,"Watch, Same number, different battery","I purchased this because I initially purchase another brand from a local store and even though the numbers were identical, the battery from the store was just slightly larger in diameter as well and depth. Be careful purchasing CR2450 batteries. Especially if the battery you are rreplacing is a CR2450N. Even though they cross over as being a direct replacement, they are not. This Duracell, however was the correct size."
1,Where is My Product,"I ordered this back in the winter of 2004, and kept getting message from Amazon indicating that there is a delay in shipping the product. After 2 delays, I just canceled the order. That is the first time I had a bad experience with Amazon, and I planned to cancel my Amazon-branded Visa card as a protest."
1,don't expect to recieve this item,"Who ever is selling this can't even seem to come up with the product. I suggest finding someplace else to purchase it. I ordered this in Feburary now its April and they still can't seem to find one to ship. They claim ships in one to two weeks, yeh right. Allergies and other nastys in the air don't wait for these shmos."
5,Very Durable Toy,"My son got this bunny when he was born, 8 ears ago. It became his favorite toy. The bunny was washed 100 times at least... ( maybe more ) and still in great condition.very durable, color faded a little, but that's OK,"
3,Midnite Manager - NOT,I bought this particular knife for the light but guess what? The light didn't work. It was very disappointing and was a Christmas present for a relative.
2,Nice knife but not what I ordered,"I bought this knife after much research. I determined from dozens of victorinox knives which had the exact features I wanted. I could have purchased the midnight manager for far less from somewhere else if I had wanted the red LED. I intentionally paid more because the picture showed a white LED and the description said ""white LED"". What actually arrived? One with a red LED. So, no, I am not happy. I expect more from Amazon."
3,get it right!,"This item would be great if it was as described. It is supposed to have a white light but it arrived with a red light. I exchanged for the right one... Guess what red again. Too bad, it would have been nice to have the right one... sent both back"
4,Does not come with White LED,"Since this is a known problem and nothing has been done to correct it, I think Amazon should offer to replace all of these RED LED knives with what they have advertised."
4,Good little tool,This is a pretty good little knife. I've always had great luck with Victorinox products. My only complaint is that the LED is red; a white LED would make it perfect.
2,There are better choices out there,"I only give this two stars because there are a few snippets of code that are worth absorbing. However this book has enough errors to make the subject matter confusing. I've used quite a few ""Dummies"" books as intros to a variety of subjects in my 20 years of programming. They have for the most part been quite helpful.I always expect some errors from books dealing with technical material, but the errors here are of a nature so as to cause confusion, especially to those new to PHP.My bottom line recommendation is not to use this book if you are new to programming or to PHP. You'll spend more time than warranted separating the wheat from the chaff. There are much better intros to be had. Try Sam's ""PHP, MySQL and Apache"" or Sitepoint's ""Object Oriented PHP Solutions"". Both are accurate, easy to understand, and have code samples that are easy to get to."
3,Editor must have been on vacation!!!,"Although I am learning a lot from this book, I am frustrated by the number of typo's. I finally figured out that when you see an underscore, it might really be a single or double quote...Now, I need to go back and make sure if an underscore ever really means underscore...Does the author of these books ever read these reviews???"
2,Misleading.,"This is one of those cases where what I thought I was getting in fact is NOT WHAT I GOT!. Honestly, the book seems to be ok, but as a learning refrence it's not anywhere close to what I thought it was going to be. I bought the book because it said it was aimed towards beginners and pros, and that it was a good place to start. NOT> If you already have some PHP knowledge, it might be useful as a refrence guide. But it covered stuff like navigating the files on my computer and I just don't know why I would ever go through the trouble of writing a script for that. If your knowledge is intermediate, this book might be ok for you, but if your beginning your knowledge from day one like myself. stay away from this book, it's not what your looking for."
2,"Good, but tooooo many typos","It is a good book for beginners, but there are just too many typos, which can cause a beginner to be more confused at times."
1,"Cold, Calculating and Mean---Not worth ONE star!","Having read most of Nin's fiction and all of her diaries, I'd say that Ms. Blair is perhaps a tad bit jealous of a writer far, far superior to herself. Nin was one of the greatest female poets and dreamers of all time, not a liar as Ms. Blair suggests. Every man and woman alive should read her diaries to better understand the feminine soul. There is nothing in the entire world's literature that compares to their depth of insight into a woman. Read Anais Nin; forget Ms. Blair!"
2,Unsympathetic and Cold but Well Researched,"The only reason I can imagine that Anais Nin's family allowed Deirdre Bair access to Nin's unpublished writing is that they still harbor resentment toward Nin. Bair is consistently sarcastic and belittling toward Nin in this biography, failing to evince the barest hint that she understands or sympathizes with the experiences that compelled Nin to behave as she did throughout her life. Bair's own motivations in writing this book must have lain in a desire to be the first to completely and exhaustively document Nin's life and note her sometimes harsh judgment of Nin, not in any love of her subject."
1,superficial treatment,"An extremely disappointing biography. Deirdre Bair skates along the surface of a very complicated, deeply neurotic, but talented and interesting woman, and makes no effort to explore the depths of Nin. Bair claims in the introduction to have attempted to write objectively, but what continually shines through the book is her dislike of Nin and her judgements of her as lazy, spoiled and unethical. Bair writes with all the finesse of a frustrated boulevard press contributor and is simply out of her area of competence here. Nin is a fascinating person, both in a literary and psychological sense, and the fact that she was so manipulative, a pathological liar, and a bigamist should make a delving into her psyche all the more rewarding. Bair does not seem to know how to delve and I am not so sure she even knows what the psyche is. I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more than who Nin had sex with or the tricks she pulled on Hugo."
2,Instead of Mittens...,"This biography is a thorough catalogue of facts about the life of a complicated woman, but you can warm your hands off the hatred that emanates from its pages. Why write a book about a subject you do not like? I am also offended by Bair's announcement that Nin is a ""minor"" writer. Who decides these things? (Let it be known that for decades F. Scott Fitzgerald was also considered a ""minor"" writer by the critics of the day. A few decades later, they'd changed their minds.)Anais Nin is not for everyone. If you don't like Anais Nin and need more facts to back your views, check out this book. If you like Nin, or are interested in learning about her, there are other, more discerning, means."
2,Difficult read,"I personally preferred his other works much more. Pan seemed to be really hard to read. It has some really beautiful prose with lyrical descriptions of the forests, but even though its a very short novel, I couldn't finish it.'Mysteries', 'Growth of the soil', 'wayfarers' and 'Hunger' were much better !"
3,Like pulling teeth,"This textbook provides everything an aspiring nurse researcher could want to know. But I find the writing style very academic, wordy, and hard to get through. I'm a straight-A BSN student, and I have to read most sentences more than once to understand what they're saying. Research is not my style, but this book is probably helpful if you enjoy it. A statistics background would be very helpful. Most students will be required to get this book for a class, so this review is moot, but not probably a great pick for pleasure reading."
2,Difficult,"All I can say that this is a difficult read. Difficult to understand not just by a student, but also by my instructor who has a Doctorate and was reading this for the first time with us. Best suggestion if this is an assigned reading is to try to find a reference that puts the needed research tools into much more simpler format. Would not recommend this even for graduate studies which is the level that I am at taking this course."
3,"Work book ok, but CD Rom is great.....","This is the workbook for the text required for my class. I did not have time to use it, but it could be helpful for those who need extra help. I did enjoy the CD Rom. I like to use the computer for study whenever I can. The questions are not extensive, but it is great practice."
4,history of open water swimming,"I was impressed with how big a sport open water swimming was in the recent past. Excellent chronicle of the early days. It reads dated now, but the content is still fascinating."
4,"A bit dated, but great reading!","The original copy of this book was released in the early 70s, and politically-correct readers probably won't warm to his outdated language (esp. in referring to female swimmers). But if you can forgive the author by remembering when it was written, Wennerberg excels at describing in detail what these swimmers went through to accomplish feats like the English Channel, Lake Michigan, etc. He makes you feel as if you're swimming right along with these pioneers of long-distance swimming in the 1950s and 60s as they stroke across some famous bodies of water, all before the advent of modern wetsuits and goggles!Obviously, Wennerberg does not mention any swims after the early 1970s (except in the afterwards of the 1997 edition), but being a rather young open-water swimmer, I really enjoyed reading about the brave men & women who paved the way for those of us who enjoy open-water swimming today."
5,Track List,"Made in Czechoslovakia and released in 1989 on the Jazz Information label (catalog number RBD 3003). Mono recording.1.

Admiration (Stomp)14. Farewell Blues15. Let's Have A Jubilee - Ivie Anderson, vocal16. Margie"
5,Improved Remake,"The Medici Quartet's first recording of Elgar's String Quartet and Piano Quintet, released in the 1980's on the Meridian label, was marred by less than ideal sound quality - especially in the Quintet, which suffered from poor balance between strings and piano. This remake, recorded in 1992 and released on their own independent label, marks a considerable improvement. The performances themselves are quite similar; these were signature pieces for the Medicis and, in the Quintet, John Bingham; both works are played with deep affection and authority."
5,Writer's Handbook,"As a writer, I sometimes use this book as a starter for dialogue. As a teacher of creative writing, I use phrases to jumpstart poems, stories and plays for my students. I know, it sounds counter-intuitive that the trite will be reborn fresh, but that happens."
2,SLANG AMERICAN STYLE,GREAT BOOK TO OWN ! I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH IT HAS HELPED ME TO UNDERSANDEVERYDAY ENGLISH. I REALLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL SPANISH SPEAKERS. NOW I CAN UNDERSTAND MANY OF THE AMERICAN SLANG I HEAR ON MOVIES OR PEOPLE I TALK TO.
2,"Good Software, but Poor Service","I share the feelings of other reviewers regarding Turbo Tax's poor customer service. I had a particularly bad experience. When I filed electronically, their central computer facility doubled the amount of my income that was forwarded to the IRS. I learned of this when I received a notice from the IRS informing me of the additional tax that I owed. Their customer service person, who was very difficult to reach, was of no help, and refused to even acknowledge any responsibility on their part for the mess up. To correct the problem, I had to file an amended return, which cannot be done electronically. It was finally sorted out, but I didn't receive my refund until months after I would have had I not used Turbo Tax."
1,Last Chance to make a first impression,Just tried several times to buy Turbo Tax Download off your website. This would be my first purchase on Amazon. Your server just locked up during each attempt. Hopefully no charge on my Amex Card. Best Buy here I come.
2,"hopelessly annoying,needlessly confusing,potentially expensi","I've never used tax software before. While it has some advantages, there are sufficient traps,confusions and incompletions to make this a potentially hazardous undertaking. Little things like being very obtuse about including your estimated tax in total taxes. Big things like not having the rules for underpayment penalty of taxes in the software. Come on guys, it's not that hard they're in IRS Pub 17. Dumb things like trying to assess a premature IRA withdrawl penalty for a 1099-R pertaining to a matured life insurance policy. Then there's the mess with Sched K-1. None of these are ready yet, try downloading. 5 hours later, it gets all the way through and crashes. In some ways it was better than manual. At least it would have been if I could control it and or complete it. I guess I'll just use this as a set of crib notes for manual prep. Oh well"
1,DON'T BUY TURBO TAX,"What a nightmare! Our tax return was mangled by Turbo Tax, and the ""help"" features are useless. My state of Virginia tax looked ok when it was on the monitor, but when I tried to file electronically it was altered. The withholding tax we paid was omitted and we were listed as owing thousands. Although I clicked the ""save"" button as I was working, when I got to the end I found I could view the forms but not print them. I got many error messages. I'm going to have to spend many hours sorting this out. Avoid Turbo Tax like the plague!"
1,The Last Time I Will Use Turbo Tax,"When it imported my information from 2002 it also picked up internet connection data that is no longer valid. Since then I have gone to broadband with a new ISP. It simply refuses to recognize my new connection information. When I tried to update the program by going to their support site through my browser, I simply could not get on despite repeated attempts. I guess everyone is trying to get support for this buggy software. As a result, I can't print out some of my forms because it tells me I must update first. Now it is totally useless. BEWARE"
3,Worth it if you're going to itemize...otherwise forget it,"Okay, the download process was a nightmare as described by my earlier review. However, three hours later I have a very comprehensive itemized return, which would have been way too complex to do on my own without the guidance of the filing questions. The good news is that I had done my taxes by hand last night and came up with a large amount owed, and after using the deductions calculator in TurboTax ended up with a refund instead. So it more than paid for itself.My major complaint is that there appears to be no way to review the content of your return until the very last ""print and submit"" step, and I wanted to check the numbers prior to actually submitting it."
1,Horrible!!,"I absolutely agree with the reviews here. I could not print out my return, it wouldn't let me uncheck boxes, and when I checked back for my file status after filing all of my information was gone!! I tried chatting with customer representatives online but they gave robotic answers that had nothing to with my questions. This is an absolutely horrible product and do not use it unless you want to waste your time and be frustrated!"
3,Terrible,"This was the year that taxes became a nightmare, and Turbo Tax cost me a bundle. The calculations were highly inaccurate and I ended up having to refile my taxes, after recomputing everything manually. A highly unsatisfactory program, in 2003 at least."
1,Ridiculous,I ordered a download of the product for immediate use and I had to wait over one hour for the order to be processed. Get your act together Amazon.
1,Don't even think about it.,The product maybe OK but I wouldn't know. I can't get the software to download. How hard can it be??? BUY THE CD!!!!
4,like it is,"The sarcasm and the scorn ooze from every paragraph. Rochefort had a playwright's ear for language and had understood the lessons of Céline: slang is borne from hatred. Her narrator, Josyane, doesn't like children, doesn't like women, and for the most part doesn't care much for men either. It's only a small number of people and things that make life worth living at all in this tableau of 1950's working-class housing projects around Paris. The natalist policy of the postwar government rewards parents for having more children, whether they'll take care of them or not: ""This isn't a living space, it's a breeding pen"" remarks Josyane. When her mother, pregnant for the tenth time, complains that there won't be enough beds, Josyane reassures her: ""Oh, maybe this'll be a miscarriage like the last one. No point in worrying about it until it's here."" In Josyane, Rochefort created one of the most memorable and ultimately likeable characters in postwar French fiction."
5,The latest options for advanced Poser users,"Denise Tyler and Audre Vysniauskas' PRACTICAL POSER 6 comes from an avid Poser user and author of several other books on the subject, and provides advanced Poser users with the latest set of options for the program. An introductory overview and review opens chapters which quickly move to more advanced features of working with interfaces and building scenes with the Poser library. Black and white screen shots offer plenty of applied examples while a centerfold of color polishes results."
4,before spending 70$ at amazon,"***stores in my area (hobby stores, meijers etc) sell this game for $35***This version is much better than the clone wars version, rules are not too tricky to understand. Depending on the child I would say between [...] they will be able to play unassisted once they learn the rules."
4,"Star Wars Risk, nice new twist on an old classic!!","The Star Wars Risk game is keenly detailed with nice plastic playing pieces taken straight from the movies. Game play can be challenging for younger players, as it is a little complex, but the game includes instructions for basic Risk, and starts you with that, which really helps. Great game for Star Wars fans"
5,Clear and In-Depth!,"This is a great book for beginning/intermediate Japanese students. It describes the usage of particles, select verb phrases, and common sentence patterns very thoroughly, especially where appropriate context is required. Instead of just saying ""A kara, B"" means ""because of A, B"", this book delves into the complexities of kara implying direct cause and effect, even blame.As for the use of romanji, it's annoying and ill-suited to a book that is not for absolute beginners. However, in a way it's also better than furigana because it's easier to practice reading kanji. I find that I've developed the annoyingly lazy habit of just reading furigana even if I know the kanji.All in all, a great supplemental text!!"
4,If you have a certain backround- it's a nice book,"The field of language books and Japanese language in particular, is as enormous as can be. It's important to know where to start, and how to accumulate information in order to make a steady move forward while learning any language. This book, though trying to give you as much general information about the language as possible, is not for beginners. If you want some real basic Japanese, try any Kodansha book or any other college students book that will give you the right start. Although not for beginners as I said, it's a very handy book for the more experienced Japanese learner, and will give you bunds of information that'll make your language familiarity better. Again, a book not to start from, but a great supplementary didactic tool for the advanced user."
2,Couldn't Make A Great Connection,This book is very informative but it doesn't keep your attention for too long. It is written almost in the nature of a school's textbook and tends to be a bit bland forcing me to re-read certain sections after my attention span nosedived.
3,Only so-so,"While this book is better than many of TFH's other Reptile and Amphibian care books it still isn't all that great. The information is farily limited some of the few species recieving ""in-depth coverage"" are not at all appropriate for beginers. There is nothing in here that isn't in the book by Sean McKowen and Phillipe Devilj-howeveryouspellit."
2,"Great, if you like false alarms and being woken up in the middle of the night for nothing!","Garbage. We have 6 smoke alarms in our house. Two of them are First Alert. This one, and another model. The ONLY ones that repeatedly false alarm are the First Alert. This one is the WORST. Randomly, for ZERO reason, it goes off. Usually in the middle of the night. Called Customer Service and they tried to tell us it was because it was near a bathroom with humidity. Yea, right. Moved it downstairs, near NO bathrooms or kitchens and it STILL falses. GARBAGE"
2,Hopefully mine was just a fluke.,"Lasted about 6 months before it just started ""chirping"" abount once a minute. Replaced the battery and it did the same thing. Also one light flashes when it chirps. It took some digging but this means the unit has failed and needs replacing. You would think since it has a ""service"" light, that light would come on solid if it wasn't working. I was trying to figure out if I had a real problem. Not very intuitive."
2,Worked great...until it died,"I have always had first alert smoke alarms and they always worked great and lasted for what seems like forever, in fact, i have never had a smoke alarm die, until now. When I moved into my aparment 10 years ago, my first alert smoke alarm was there already and to this day, it still works. I only changed the alarm because of new laws. A year after I started using this one, it died on me. I was very disappointed in the longevity of the product."
1,False Alarm Problem,"I have had serious problems with false/""nuisance"" smoke alarms with this product."
1,False alarm gives me heart attacks,"This alarm is terrible. It goes off all the time with no reason. At first we thought maybe it was cause the stove was so close to it (almost right under it). When we remodelled we put the stove on the other side by a window too, we thought this would help. Nope, It's woken my entire family TWICE last night alone for false alarms. But what scares me even more was that someone leaned on the stove and accidental turned the gas on. We didn't smell gas at all however my sister's detector picked it up down stairs across the house!! For your family's safety DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ALARM!"
5,Excellent Smoke/Carbon Monoxide Alarm,This combination alarm has worked perfectly in our home. I have since replaced others with this model.
1,Simply Unusable,"The CO detector is the third we've had and they have alll gone to the garbage. The last one is sitting beside me with the sensor module pulled out. It goes off about once an hour no matter where it is placed. I would have to say that First ALert seems to make pure ""junk""."
1,False alarms when I turn on a light,"Piece of junk. First one wouldn't quit alarming when I installed. Replaced with a second. It false alarms every time the nearby lamp is turned on OR off. It not only then warns of fire, but it alarms for CO too although it quotes a CO level of 0 parts per million. Family has told me either it goes or they do. Tough decision...... but ...... Never had any problems with prior one and the prior one definitely did go off validly a couple of times when something smoked in the nearby kitchen. No other choices at Lowe's.... guess I'll go hunting."
2,DOA,"Item received, installed but in few days service indicator and beeps came on so I uninstalled it and filed a complain. Havent heard anything from seller yet."
1,This Alarm Will Really Keep You Awake!,"Seems to go off for no reason in the middle of the night. I tried opening the unit to shake out the dust - only there wasn't any. I went on vacation and had to get my father to go to my house and disconnect the unit because it was keeping the neighbors awake. It also kept me up when I was sick. The unit is nice and quiet when you remove the battery; of course, then it doesn't protect you either. Real Garbage!! Do NOT buy!!"
4,Another good one...,"I've had the book for about a month now and have worked thru the first 10 chapters so far, so good. The explanations with sample code really works for me as far as learning. And the CD includes sample data and files to work with so that you have data to pull from instead of just seeing that your code looks nice. No complaints thus far other than minor grammar errors here and there along the way, but I can understand with all us CF addicts screaming for them to hurry!"
2,Review for a 2.5 gallon container of the same type - inconvinient,I bought a 2.5 gal container of the same type of this company in a local hardware store. The discharge is very inconvenient and may be plainly dangerous if you spill. I think a simple (probably forbidden for use) a one-gallon container from milk plus a funnel could be better that this device.
1,"Lousy design at best, could be dangerous at worst",The tank seems durable but the spout is a poor design compared to the No-Spill product also sold by Amazon.
4,Gas can,What can I say about a gas can....it is strong...pours easily....best feature is the two handles for comfort with pouring
1,Bad Spout Design,The design of this spout for Safety require you hold 50 pounds of fuel in the air for 5-10 minutes to pour it out.Throwing them away.
1,More Plastic Junk,"I use to have a couple basic gas cans, they had a screw on nozzle and a cap that went under it to seal it when not in use or beingtransported. They work perfectly, pour easiliy, don't leak and last a good long time. When I went to replace them I found I could not longer buy a basic gas can, just pieces of junk like this that supposedly help prevent spills and leaks but, in reality, much more gas spills and lekas from thees than did from the old metal cans or my old plastic can.This is hard to operate, leaked all over the place when trying to fill something and then the nozzle cracked.If you can find a plain basic gas can, buy it. I've been through a couple other gas can marvels since and they are all just junk."
4,Functional and Easy to use,This dual handle gasoline storage tank is great as it has two handles helping you balance a full tank or less with ease. Less spillage is always good as many know how other gas containers spill everywhere. Not this guy.
1,Thank you big brother,There should be a 0 star just for this product. I spilled so much gas filling my generator that I spent an hour cleaning it up in fear of torching myself and the unit. This container needs to be recalled and taken off the market to protect people and property.
2,Not easy to use,This tank is not spill proof and you almost need 3 hands to pour it safely into a boat or personal watercraft
1,Another plastic waste of money,"I've owned this for probably 5 years. The ""spill proof"" design spills some gas every time I've filled my mower and the sliding part of the nozzle which opens and closes the flow has become less and less movable, which of course causes more and more fuel to spill each time. Now, it won't even slide at all. Plus today, I needed to put gas in my car for the first time and it won't fit into the car's filler hole. I'm really tired of buying stuff that is destined to fail shortly after it leaves the store."
2,It's the spout,"I own several of these cans and the CARB spouts are useless, the cans are fine, it's the spout. I noted that a warning on the can said it was not to be used for on the road filling but couldn't believe it. Why do most people buy these things? But I complained to the company anyway about my inability to use their product to put gas in my truck. They sent me several 6"" plastic extenders which also didn't work. But there is a solution. Last time I visited family out-of-state, I went to Walmart and bought a half dozen non-CARB replacement spouts and they work perfectly for me."
2,Not for on-road vehicles,"The nozzle does not fit the standard unleaded gasoline filler neck of an automobile, so you can't refuel your car with this container. To be fair, the adhesive label attached to the container does clearly state, ""Not intended for refueling on-road motor vehicles"", but Amazon doesn't mention this caveat in the description so you have no way of knowing until you receive the item.I had to return mine since I bought it specifically to keep some extra fuel in the shed for my car. If are looking for a can to fill your car, this is not the one. If you need a can to fill your riding mower, this might work for you. Amazon should probably move this item out of the Automotive Store and put it in Home and Garden Store with a better description of its limitations.Finally, the container cannot be sealed without the nozzle in place and sticking up (as shown in the product photo). In my opinion this makes the container more vulnerable to damage and leaks, and thus less safe."
1,Dangerous as well as inconvenient,"As mentioned in other reviews, this is NOT for cars and trucks. I bought it for use on the riding mower, filling smaller cans and for my dual sport bike. It's virtually impossible to fill any of these without spilling.But worst of all, it split along the seam at the top and sloshes gas out when carrying and fills it's storage area with fumes. Forget it!"
2,a dumb design (or designer),"Like the earlier reviewer who also had a Ph.D., I find that it is usually possible to get through the minor glitches in everyday life without going crazy. But this has got to be the dumbest design for such a simple device as a gas can as one can imagine. I note that Blitz has gotten the message, and is now selling the so-called Enviro-Flo spouts, which are also CARB-compliant, and may conceivably work better."
1,"Awful, dangerous product","There is no way to use this Blitz 31733 can without spilling gasoline everywhere. Who do we thank for this latest ""consumer protection""?!! It is mind boggling that a product like this could make it to market. Someone please let me know when I can buy a gas can that works again."
3,It's a gas can what more do you want,"It's really difficult to open. But it's not like you are trying to Sypher gas and run. For 5 gallons, who cares."
1,pretty but quality is terrible,"This clock is very pretty, but unfortunately that's the only good thing I can say about it. First, it doesn't come with a sufficient hanger. There's a plastic loop at the top of the clock mechanism, but it doesn't seem sturdy enough -- this clock is heavy. I bought a plate hanger and replaced the spring with picture wire. Second, as soon as I took it out of the styrofoam, the metal rim around the edge popped open, and started to separate from the glass. Then, the 2 fell off. When I tried to set the time, the hands were completely loose and wouldn't stay put. Once I'd re-assembled the clock mechanism and put in a fresh battery, it seemed to be working; the next morning I found that the hands had moved for about 6 hours before stopping. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this product."
2,"very pretty, but....","Beautiful clock, but I have to agree with much of what the previous reviewer said. I've owned it for about a year and a half. In that time I've re-glued a few tiles and had to replace the clock mechanism (the company sent one for free). The hook does seem flimsy, although mine has held. I also own the thermometer, with similar problems. All in all, they are quite beautiful, but not well made."
3,"Fun To Watch, Not A Good Science Project","The ant farm is a fun and good educational toy for children interested in learning about basic social behavior of ants. However, if your child wants to use this ant farm for a science project, plan on either hunting for the ants yourself in your backyard/local park -- or on child not completing the project in time. Ordering the ants using the enclosed coupon (with [...]shipping/handling) is simply not a viable option since the ants, shipped to you without a queen, would only last a couple of weeks, and you cannot time when to send in the order, as Uncle Milton seems to be filling their orders at their leisure (ours took about three months)."
2,Dead Ant Farm,"I was pretty disappointed with this product. First of all, the ants are not included in the initial price. You have to purchase them online after you get the product and they will cost you another $5. When I received my ants, at least half of them were already dead. Already not off to a good start. After following all the directions, placing the ants in the farm along with a few drops of water and food I waited till the next day to see their progress. Well, all I found were dead ants! All of them died within 24hrs! I thinking you might be better off finding your own ants in the yard if you order this product."
5,ants arrived on time,Many customers have said that it took forever for their ants to arrive. We received our ants in 3 weeks and 2 days which is within the 2-4 weeks range given on the certificate. Ants cannot be shipped when it is too hot or cold in your area which is why we ordered ours in May.
1,A good toy starts with good engineering,"So I finally get the ants in the mail, and I waste half of the day putting the ants and sand in exactly according to the instructions, only to get to see them in action for 4 days. Just as they were building their tunnels, my dog knocked over the plant next to the windowsill they were on, which made the room shake, and subsequently cause the ant farm to tip over. I can get over having to clean up all the dirt and ants, but come on, shouldn't a child's toy have sturdier base. I couldn't believe that the Uncle Milton company wouldn't think to build a product that had a larger, heavier base. Geez."
1,"You get what you pay for - ""Ignore - Ant""","Frankly, shipping Ants across the country and then sandwiching them in between plates of plastic is an education in ignorance. It is no wonder most have died within a week! If you wish to experience any of God's creatures in a healthy, natural, intelligent and compassionate context, get off your keister and watch them where they choose to live. There is no State in the USA where ants do not thrive."
3,bit me!!the little bogor..,"i got my any farm last year happily i opened it....and took EVERY thing out in one load.i filled out the form and got my ants i decided to slowly put them in...outside!well 15 of my anties escaped and 2 bit me!!!after a good fight with them i got them in and brought them in.my finger was burning.but, the next day i woke up and ALL my ants had died that night.i was soo mad i threw everything away!*sings and skips off*"
1,customer service sucks,"I bought my grandson one of your ant farms. I ordered the ants only four ants were alive when they got to my house. I e-mailed customer service to tell them the ants were dead to see what to do,twice. They will not get back with me.One hell of a way to run a business. I would never buy nothing from this company again. They do not stand behind there product. I will tell my friends the same"
3,uncle milton Giant Ant Farm,The farm itself is great. It's the waiting for the ants part that can be exhausting if you have an eager child like mine who will ask everday if the mail has arrived.This was our second round with ants and this time they died really fast. Customer service is really great and I am sure I could have discussed this with them but my son wasn't so upset this time.I recommend this item to all.
3,Great (while it lasted...),"Bought the ant farm (the ""Bug's Life"" version)for my sons (7 and 10 y.o.) There was the initial dissappointment of having to wait for the ants to arrive.Part of the farm was a section covered by a removeable (intentional?) umbrella-shaped cover. Maybe this was my mistake, but I glued the cover on. Maybe the glue wasn't good for the ants.We followed the instructions closely, but about 80% of the ants died within about a week. The other 20% weren't too far behind.What *was* kind of fun was collecting our own ants...Georgia Fire Ants!They were big and very aggressive. They died soon too.I threw away the farm a few weeks ago."
2,All ants dead in 2 weeks.,Took like 2 months to get the ants. Two weeks for them to die. We have 2 ants alive. After two weeks. I don't know.... We followed the instructions...
3,Better than expected,"Okay, half the ants were DOA, but we had 7-8 hang around for a few months. We left for vacation and thought we'd lost them all. A couple of days later, we notice two ants still roughing it out on leftover scraps. I'd say the thrill lasted a little longer than we needed it to! The tubing should be longer to make the stretch from one end of the farm to the other--it can kink, prohibiting ants from going through one end. Use a dropper to put water in the farm."
4,Fun For the Whole Family,My five year old received the ant farm for his birthday last year. We all were fascinated to see the ants dig their tunnels. It was even interesting to watch as they made an ant burial ground for those who died off. The ants came during a freeze in November and were left in the mailbox for a full day. Only two were dead when we opened the tube. I think it is a great product and a lot of fun.
5,Cmon People,"Don't be thrown off by everyone saying their ants die quickly after coming in the mail. Remember your buying something that is alive, spend the extra money to get it shipped priority, otherwise it will take two weeks to get there and think of how many times your ants are being thrown around. Also ants only live 45-90 days. Buy some as a starter then go outside and add to your collection. Ants die, just like people, but the colony will survive so long as you let it and keep bringing in more ants."
3,ants don't last long,"I bought this ant farm for my 5 year old son. He enjoyed it and we fed and watered the ants as instructed but within 3 weeks they were all dead. I guess I expected more time before I had to replace and clean the farm. Still a good product and I will keep it, just won't always have live ants. Maybe just a couple times a year."
4,giant ant farm,"nice ant farm. my advise is -After filling the ant farm with the ""sand"" provided,that you be very careful about cleaning it off of the outside-it will easily scratch the outside of the clear plastic window."
3,Not so bad.,"when i first opened this farm my first thought was, wow this thing looks brittle and after a brief observation i discover this to be true, so handle with care. It comes in a Typical box, with 2 little bags of perlite to fill it up. It also comes with a decent set of instructions. All in all im pleased with this product. I ended up customizing it a little, by adding some sand with the perlite, and putting a thin layer on the top section. I also took some of the ant food i bought and pushed it down into the perlite, hoping this will encourage them to dig dig dig."
1,Uncle Milton Disappoints Kids,"I thought an Ant Farm would be a great product, but dealing with the Uncle Milton company was a disaster!After you purchase the product you have to send Uncle Milton's money for the ants, and then wait. And Wait. And Wait.After 5 weeks, I called Uncle Miltons and they still had no idea when they could ship the ants. Even worse - they have no problem cashing your check as soon as they get it, which makes no sense if they know they don't have ants to send to you.Customer service was unacceptable (there's no toll-free number either), and my request to speak with a manager was sent to a voicemail box and was not returned.Try explaining all of this to a kid waiting to play with their new toy, and the only conclusion is to stay away from Uncle Milton products, unless you're trying to teach children how to deal with disappointment."
2,Not Very Impressed...,"Well, it's all been said before, but the ant ""farm"" just doesn't hold up to expectations. The ants we recieved didn't live but a couple of weeks, which I believe the reason now to be that they didn't have a queen. By the way, for those of you who want to give them freedom and put them back in the wild, with no queen they'll die or be killed by other ants, so might as well just keep them. By the way, there is another ant farm that we tried and actually I prefer better. It's by Educational Insights called AntZone Habitat."
4,"Great concept, mediocre implementation","The Ant Farm is a wonderful educational toy, but the quality is disappointing as other reviewers have said. The plastic has rough, unattractive edges from manufacture, and the bottom is not perfectly flat, so it can wobble a little bit. None of this will matter to my nephews, but certainly the manufacturer should do a better job."
3,Bummer,I'm disappointed that I have to mail away for the ants. Uncle Milton needs to get a web page so I can order my ants online.
4,"Fun, if You Know What Your'e Doing","I had an ant farm and it was such joy that i bought another one! I would suggest this toy to people who like to watch things and not bother them. This is not for those not so smart people who like to torture ants and stuff. People told me that the ants would not live long. That is because they didnt read the instructions. It was easy, put the sand in, cotton thingy, then order ants. So far i havent had any stings though, which is a safety issue with a lot of little kids."
2,Useless without a Queen Ant,"An ant farm. Seems like fun, right? Wrong! Just to let all of you know who plan on buying ANY ant farm. Whether you catch the ants yourselves or Uncle Milton sends you some, the ants will all die unless you get the queen ant as well. You will most likely not get a queen ant from Uncle Milton and I doubt you will have any luck catching one. Witout the queen, the ants will just sort of wander aimlessly and eventually pass on. Still, I guess if you want low maintanence pets then it's either this or sea monkeys. Like sea monkeys, however, this will end up disappointing."
3,Ant farm,"I think the ant farm is great, but the ants do not live long. It has been three weeks since I received the ants and I have one left. I only gave them bottled water this time, and it did not help. The instruction book inside the ant farm box states they live a few months. When I talked to someone from Uncle Milton, they said 3 - 4 weeks. That is not a long time."
5,Very entertaining!,"My son received this as a gift last Christmas. At first I didn't know how I felt about having an ant farm in our house. But, I have been pleasantly surprised. It has been so much fun to watch these little guys work! We have had numerous visitors to our home who are amazed at them as well. Not something a child can ""play"" with. Just something to watch."
5,Happy Mom & Baby,"I just received this chair today and already I am very happy with it. I ordered the Mocha color although I really wanted the Orchard, so that it would match my daughter's carrier & stroller. I don't think the pic online of the mocha does it justice. I am really happy with the color.I was also able to put this chair together myself in about 30 minutes. (with the ""help"" of my 3 & 4 yr olds) My 6 month old seems to really enjoy it. I wasn't sure what I would do with the toybar after reading the other reviews where people said they don't use it etc, but I like it. I think it's great. My daughter sure did enjoy it also. We will definately use it when she sits at the table with us and she's already finished. It will occupy her so that I can finish! I'm also happy with how fast it got here. Estimated delivery was 6-9 but we received it 6-2! The only assembly problem I had was with the basket. That's not even a big deal. I would definately reccomend this chair!"
2,What a mess!,"Yes, the trays are nice...and the 5 point harness...but the material of the chair cushion is aweful to keep clean. This high chair was a gift, and I wish I had one that I could wipe down after every use.It is a cloth-like material, and it looks aweful after just one use. My 6 month old also gets his arms stuck inbetween the tray and the seat. He also get's his feet stuck up underneath too. I think he'll grow out of it though as he gets bigger."
4,Good highchair,"We bought this highchair since it went with the rest of our Graco set. Easy setup and our son loves it. Nice removable tray makes clean up quick and easy since you can take the tray right to the sink. Chair reclines which makes it nice for a younger baby to sit at the table even before they are eating solid foods. The pad isn't ""machine washable"" per the manufacturer but I have washed it with only minor spots where the color came out. The toy bar is useless since the toys do not hang at a height to allow the baby to reach them and it is always falling off. In general we love Graco products, but we would have liked additional fabric/pattern choices."
3,A fair highchair,The Harmony highchair is good chair except for the tray. It often gets stuck when attempting to pull it open with one hand. This can be frustrating when I'm holding my daughter and trying to open the seat.
1,"unsafe, unhappy mommy and baby","I have had the appauling experience of my daughters arms getting stuck between the tray, and the seat. She also get her feet stuck while sitting. She curls her feet up into the lower tray, where they become stuck. Fortunately, I never leave her unattended, because I am certain that there would be serious injury, as only bruises have occured. I would not recommend this to anyone! There are plenty of highchairs out there, research before you buy! (this was a gift!)"
3,It matches but some functions are difficult to use...,"We have a matching Pack 'N Play so it looks nice in our dining/living room. The high chair has all the necessary functions but some are a bit difficult to use. First, the three-level reclining function is really hard to use, it sticks and you need some trick to pull it down - I can never do it by one hand. The five point harness is nice but the harness from the shoulder needs to be slided and attached to the waist harness every time you use. Though I know it is not entirely safe, I usually end up not using the shoulder harness for that reason. I like the easy removable tray and the snack tray underneath, which is handy. The vinyl chair cover is also durable and easy to clean. All in all, we like the product but some of the functions could be improved."
3,"Nice, but not worth the price.","This high chair is a nice, no frills high chair. It was pretty easy to put together. The toybar comes off too easy, which is supposed to be a safety feature to prevent climbing children, but when it flips behind the seat it comes off its latch ""by itself"", making it an inconvenience. For the price, I rate it average, but I could have spent half the money on a chair that is just as good."
4,Beautiful but smaller than expected,"These diamonds are absolutely beautiful, honestly they are, but I was expecting a bit more of a WOW factor when I saw them for the price. The gift went over very well though. =) <3"
4,Diamonds are a girls best friend,"Gave this to my girlfriend for our 2 year anniversary, she loved it... A little smaller then what i expected but it worked in my favor. It's nice and delicate, and not to gawdy. The diamonds glisten and shimmer and the rope chain is not to long..."
5,Incredible pendant!!,"I have been looking at this pendant for over a month now. I finally decided to get it last week and I am so glad I did! The diamonds are exquisite! They are white, perfectly matched, and the sparkle is unreal. The size of the pendant is just right, slightly under an inch. It comes with a thin but sturdy white gold chain. I do wish the chain had a lobster claw clasp, but I really can't complain about this amazing deal. I have seen styles like this in stores go for $500. Thanks Amazon!!"
5,Tasty cookies,"Slightly crumbly, but overall a very good cookie. In my opinion very similar to Chips Ahoy but more airy, less dense."
4,Potato Cookies,"I am addicted to these cookies. They taste much better than the regular ones. The only draw back is, that they should be available in smaller packages - to avoid binge eating."
2,there are much better gluten and dairy free cookies,"My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay. The texture is hard and weird even when microwaved. Short shelf life if you are buying in bulk. Not absolutely terrible but worse than average. Try Pamela's chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful, or try a baking mix."
3,Not what I expected but served its purpose,"Ok so this is a really old show so I suppose I shouldn't have expected much. However, I found the picture and sound quality to be very poor. It was obvious that this wasn't professionally recorded to DVD. This is understandable because I've heard this show was pretty much banned from TV because some folks find it offensive. Anyway, I got it for my 68 year-old father and he loved it because he used to watch it as a child."
5,It Brought Light Into A Dark Time,"I purchased ""The Amos & Andy Show - Vol. 1-20 on DVD by Alvin Childress"" for a friend who was undergoing a ""last-ditch"" effort to survive cancer. It gave him moments of joy and offered a respite from his constant thoughts of hopelessness.I didn't know what to give this beautiful person who has given so much, to so many, but this turned out to be the perfect gift."
2,Poorly made,"I got this for Christmas. The video quality is terrible. And while I understand that video quality wasn't the best when this show first aired...they could have done a better job with this dvd set. In one episode the sound quality will be fair, while in the next, the volume and quality will be much lower. So from episode to episode, I find that I must constantly adjust the volume.Sometimes the screen will scroll like they used to do on older tvs. And this is just something I never expected to find on a dvd.Also, the episode titles air differently than what is printed on the disk. so they are printed out of order.Basically, what this 'seems' to be is a set of dvds pirated and sold at a flea market. Not saying it is...but that's what it looks like. Terrible quality. And the ONLY reason I haven't sent them back is that I love the Amos & Andy show so much and I doubt I can find a better set.But if you don't just absolutely love this series...skip this set. It's not worth $5."
1,Amos And Andy,"I had ordered a DVD pack and 3/4 of it was not audioable. Amazon was very fast to replace it at no charges to me,but the same problem excits with the new DVDs. I sent them a new e-mail informing them of the same problem, that was three and a half weeks ago and to date have not had a reply. I would sugest not wasting your money."
4,Amos & Andy funnier than I remembered,"Even funnier than I remembered. Some of the humor we've enjoyed over the past 50 yrs. came from these early shows. Eg. Archie Bunker and Meathead trying to go through the doorway at the same time was done long before. Kingfish and Andy did it some 20 years earlier.Episodes are well-written, wholesome and very funny."
1,Overpriced junk,"I bought 3 of these and only needed 1, but have had to use the vent caps from the other 2 that I didn't use because the vent caps split and break. The flexible spout has also cracked in the middle. I emailed Briggs & Stratton about the problem, they advised me to discontinue using the containers, with no other resolution. I emailed them several times after this, and they ignore my emails."
2,paying for name,"The quality is well below what I expected for a Brigs and Stratton product. It seams in this case B&S buyers did not do any quality checks. Hard to handle, vent cap is VERY DIFFICULT to open All around a disappointing product from a Quality Company. THE PRICE IS WAY TO HIGH JUST FOR THE BRIGGS NAME"
4,Coast Artillery History Buff,"Hi, I was planning on buying this book, but happened to see it at the Wichita Public Library. The book is full of old pictures, both of the forts while in use, and from the 1960's when the bood was written. The amount of data is great, and the book itself is well written. The book is written at medium level, enough detail so that you understand why the forts are built like they were, but not so much that you fall asleep. I have visited Fort MacArthur in Los Angeles and Fort Morgan near Mobile Alabama, so I have seen examples of the book's subject.Mike"
5,Great Tolkein addition,"This is a very classy set that I bought for my wife. I was truly amazed at how quickly it arrived, and was very carefully packed, and the condition it arrived in. It literally had to travel about half the world to get to to us, and came in about 2 weeks. I strongly recommend the set to Tolkein fans who just can't get enough."
2,It works... kind of...,I have had this lock for about 2 years. Today was the first opportunity I have had to 'unlock' it. To my surprise I found that the bottom of the lock (where the key enters) is totally oxidized! And more puzzling is that this on the bottom of the lock where I would think it would be protected from the elements. I suspect that water enters at the top of the lock and then runs down and out the key entry at the 'bottom'. I think it will be totally unuseable in another couple of years. Disappointing to say the least.
3,Pin too large. Should be made slightly smaller,"Had difficulty pushing pin through holes on FM402 dual gate. Two of the four inserts barely made it through. I had to use a hammer to finally get one lock pin through but the 4th pin wouldn't go through even with a hammer. I ended bending the pin and the frame having the two pass through holes. Could not use the lock. Because the pin is bent, it acts like a lock in itself because I'd have to try and straighten the pin and probably make things worse. So I'm out one lock. Have the manufacture thin out the pin to make sure it easily slips through the provided holes for locking the motorized arm."
1,False Sense of Security,"I installed my dual gate opener and used these locking pins to secure it. The whole system was stolen off my gate in less than five minutes. The thieves didn't even need a bolt cutter to get past these pin locks; Just a quick smack with a hammer and they broke right off. Don't bother with these locks. If you want a real deterrent, than get creative and find something much stronger."
2,Its a lock.,Its a lock that works okay when it is new. I have 3 of these locks installed on my Mighty Mule gate opener and they sort of work. After about 2 years they start to rust and wont open very well. You have to spray WD-40 into them about every 4 months to keep they working.
5,Mighty Mule Operator- Lock,"This is a must have accessory for your Mighty Mule Gate opener! If you don't add this lock, anyone with half a brain can walk away with your operator, not to mention that they will have instant access to your ""protected"" driveway. A GOOD DEAL AND MORE SECURE THAN A PIN ALONE!!!"
3,On the Small Side,"Nice product, a bit small. The cape is flexible and feels good. No major problem with it but the kids did not go crazy over it."
2,Display Model,"Added this figure to my son's batman collection, he's 4, so less than the recommended age. Still many toys hold up much better, so I'm going to knock this for durability. It's a nice figure from the looks of it, It would look great on a shelf on it's stand. For play, the shoulders and legs and arms don't articulate very well, only one wrist even articulates at all. The head broke off on day one and has now been glued twice. Also, you can see from the picture that one leg is pre-posed facing out to the side. This looks a little stranger in real life, it makes him appear asymmetrical and a bit unnatural. I'm going to make a quick comparison to his Dark Knight figure, he's had this for almost a year and it's been through a lot and has never broken. I really wish there was a way for Amazon and/or the manufacturers to recommend toys for play or display only. I'm not sure a 5 or 14 year old would treat these figures any better."
2,A beautiful printing job but just coffee table material.,"The Forward was the best reading, with interesting historical insights about map makers during the war, but with Chapter One, the book turned into a ""one over the world"" scale recap of selected battles of the war. The book displayed maps associated with a particular battle, but beyond ""pretty"" they were useless. I bought the book in the hope that the map reprints could be studied and perhaps compared to the West Point Atlas. But unfortunately, map details are mostly illegible as printed. They present the reader only with a sense of what a CW period map looked like. Fold out maps reproduced with some greater clarity and thus useful detail would have been preferred to the useless reprints of old civil war photographs which added nothing to a book on map making and probably made the book more expensive to produce. Disappointing."
3,"All Show, Not a Lot of Go...","""Mapping the Civil War"", by Christopher Nelson with Brian Pohanka, is beautifully formatted and nicely illustrated, but it isn't the history of map-making in the Civil War implied by the title. The book's foreward introduces the topic of how important handmade maps were in a country without standard geodesy products. However, Christopher Nelson's history of the Civil War that follows is unremarkable in content and coverage. There is no sustained attempt to document in detail the importance of maps to the conflict. The volume does contain a nice but surprisingly limited selection of maps, sketches, and photographs from the extensive holdings of the Library of Congress, which are beautifully presented.""Mapping the Civil War"" may be worth a look for the casual reader interested in the Civil War. More serous students of the Civil War can find more detailed content elsewhere."
1,Cynicism's retort...,"I quite literally laughed out loud when I read through this tome. It not only misjudges the dynamic of Western world views in conflict, it presupposes an ivory tower superiority without consideration of the truth claims of those against which it levels its criticisms. It would be similar to a social worker criticizing the engineering blueprints to a cobalt pulse engine without having a background in material science. What a monstrous cerebral vacuum sociology has become. Though cynicism is attempted, it does not shield the ignorance herein. Far greater minds and work have preceded this bit of flotsam. Save your funds for serious science and genuine study..."
1,Tastes awful!,This product has a very different taste than most whey protein powders I've used. I really have to fight to get it down!
1,A piece of fiction!,"This is the worst waste of eight dollars I have ever spent. It should be placed with the fiction titles instead of the computer ones.The text constantly references fields and objects that don't exist in the example code, the code is totally messed up. For instance ""j;+"" and ""j+;"" do not increment the field. it should be ""j++"". I can understand having mistakes but this book is filled with them. This book is a mistake. There are two separate pieces of code that are supposed to be different but are identical. items referenced in example code don't exist.I could go on and on about this piece of ****. Reading this book made me angry. If a student were to use this book before taking a test they would certainly fail.The editor and authors must have been near comatose from cocaine when working on this pulp."
3,Great content but poor organisation,"Earlier I had purchased Hubbard's C++ and had no complaints.But this book by the same author leaves much to be desired. The explanations are well written, ...typically Hubbard style, but I was very dissapointed by the way the examples and the chapters were organised in the book. A newcomer who is learning example by example and from chapter to chapter is bound to get confused. In an earlier chapter, an example uses try and catch block to take an input from the user, but the mechanism of try and catch blocks are explained much later in the book. So this book is basically for those who are already conversant with Java and just needs a good brushing-up. If you are new to Java, use this book as a supplement rather than your main text. The examples in the book are excellent and fun to try out."
3,The price is right!,"While this book is far from complete, and the examples are less than practical, it has the virtue of being affordable by students. It's a good choice as textbook for a course, where the main content comes from instructor-provided handouts."
5,Highly Recommended!,"I actually WON MONEY following the advice of the author! This is a no nonsense book that is highly informative and tells you everything you need to know to beat the slots. It is compact and easy to carry, it has large type so it is easy to read, and it is very affordable. A must have for anyone who plays slots!"
2,A pamphlet that should have been a webpage,"The basic premise of this book is that the best payingslots will be in the high-traffic areas, and to walkaway if you don't win more than you put in for eightpulls or so. The author puts about one paragraph on eachpage and triple-spaces. Lots of white space in this book!The 94 pages could have been ten or perhaps an interestingwebpage instead. Phooey.I bought this at the same time as buying BREAK THE ONE ARMEDBANDITS and can recommend that one instead, very highly.Stay away from this one.A. Reader"
5,Awesome toy!,"My Bullie, Tank, loves this toy. he usually destroys his to fast because of his strong chewing ability. Two years ago I bought him an Orka bone, It is showing some wear but he's had it for two years! I only buy Orka & Nylabone toys for my drooling baby."
2,Not for strong chewers,"My dog tore this thing up in about a half hour unfortunately. We also have the Tire by the same company and that thing is still great! I would only recommend the ""Jack"" maybe for puppies (you can hide treats in it!) but certainly not any dog that has a history of making short work of cheap toys."
1,Nice looking but easily shredded,"Interesting toy but too easily shredded by 5 month old cocker spaniel puppy. Got a large size Orka Bone that lasted longer, but it also got chipped and shredded fairly fast. Avoidable."
2,Not long lasting,My 76 lb. lab broke through the 2 sides with the seams in less than 2 hours. She loved it but it didn't last. It looks like there are 2 glued or heat sealed seams and that is where it came apart. THe other parts are 1 continous product and they did great. going to try the tire as is says it constructed of 1 piece.
5,"2nd best ""fetch"" toy","The ""tire"" wins hands down, but this one comes in second! Our Lab loves to blow air out as she is bring the toy back, while still in the water!"
1,Lasted less than an hour....,"My 60lb Lab loved playing with this..... for the hour it lasted.It says right on the packaging that it's ""For Your Power Chewer"" and has a photo of a Rottweiler chewing it. If you have a dog that is nowhere near a ""power chewer"", the dog might like it very much and it might be a great, long-lasting purchase. But in that we bought it for our dog based on it being marketed as appropriate for him...and it clearly wasn't....I give it one star."
2,Lasted 24 Hours,"Unfortunately, my puppy gnawed this one up in a day. The hollow parts broke up first, so I had to take it away from her. I wouldn't buy this one again. Just felt like a waste of money. I think the shape made it easier for her to grip than other similar dog toys, like Kong."
1,Not worth the money,"I just purchased one of these for my chocolate lab earlier today. It was a waste of 11.99+tax. He's already torn it apart with seemingly little effort. If you really have a dog that chews, don't waste your money on this one. Buy a Kong!"
1,I have praised other ORKA products,This toy was not spongy like other Orka toys. I have an aggressive+++ chewer. The soft sponginess of the other toys meant that it gave so the teeth didn't penetrate. This was hard. When teeth meet hard toy toy loses and so do you. 15 min.NOT FOR AGGRESSIVE CHEWERS!!!
1,NOT for power chewers,"Our chocolate lab destroyed this toy in less than 5 minutes. Don't believe the packaging that says ""for power chewers"". I've learned my lesson, only Nylabone, Kong, and Premier from now on."
4,"Play toy, not chew toy.","This toy worked great until one day I forgot to put it out of Bouli's reach after we finished playing ""catch"" with it. Left with it on his own, he almost instantly tore up the hollow part. My advice for this toy would be not to leave it around for the dog to chew on. It's wonderful for chasing and water play, and as others have said, the crazy bounces are good for hours of fun. I'll buy it again but maybe in a larger size, and I'll be more careful."
4,"Great for the average ""dense"" chewer","My dog (a Great Dane mix) isn't the smartest guy on the block, but he loves food! At first, we gave him the Kong GeniusKONG Genius Leo Dog Toy, Extra Large (Colors vary)and he loved it, but got a few chunks of the rubber off in the first hour (and he's not an aggressive chewer). I bought this since it said it was for ""power chewers"" and so far it's still in one piece!I am only giving it four stars because the one hole goes all the way through the toy, and that isn't much of a challenge since the treats don't have to go around any corners. I put his daily dentabone in the blocked ends and put a variety of treats in the hole that goes all the way through. This seems to keep him busy, but like I said ... he isn't the smartest guy on the block :) If your dog is a smarty, this probably isn't the best toy for you, but if your dog enjoys treats, go for it!"
4,The dog loves it and so does the cat.,"The dog is a 27 lbs. high-energy basenji-mix dog, the cat is an 18 lbs. orally fixated feline.The dog ate the Kong, the cat no longer eats electrical cords.Definitely recommend for small dogs. The cat is getting it's teeth through the material, but hasn't gotten through it... yet."
4,Fun while it lasted,"This is the second Orka that our dogs have had. The smaller size lasted quite a while. For some reason, this larger size Orka Jack broke in a matter of days. I will guess that average dogs will be more gentle than my dogs. Two of my three dogs can destroy anything."
1,Gone in 60 seconds...,"Clearly NOT a better chew toy! I have a 1 yr old Doberman mix who's never destroyed a toy in his life and this ""durable"" chew toy lasted less than 20 minutes. It's marketed for power chewers but I don't see how that's possible when my non-power chewer shredded it in under half an hour. Such a waste of money."
1,Not as durable as it looks... Waste of money.,"I will keep this quick: I bought the Orka chew toy because it looked and felt very durable. The description says: ""Durable material designed to stand up to tough chewers."" Well, my 2 month old puppy was ripping chunks off it within her first week home -- hardly durable. Don't waste your money. Her Kongs have held up much better... it took her over two months to destroy the puppy wubba."
1,Waste of money for large dogs,"Don't waste your money on this product if you have a large animal who likes to chew.I purchased this product as it promised it was for ""power chewers"" who were anywhere between puppies and seniors.It lasted maybe 10 minutes with my weimaraner.I feel that the product was strongly misrepresented in the packaging. The packaging shows a larger dog chewing on the toy, and states that it will last a long time and was designed for ""power chewers"".I will stick with the black KONG product for my guy. Don't waste your time and money with this toy"
1,You get what you pay for...,"I've owned this TV for right at 2 years and it started having significant problems not much after the 1 year warranty was up. The red in the picture has gotten progressively worse to the point that no amount of tuning the color's gives what I would call a good picture. In the last couple weeks, the unit has begun to do two things that pretty much put a fork in it. First it will randomly shut off for no apparent reason. That's not the worst though, it also will randomly go to a blue screen and emit a shrill noise at max volume. That'll wake you up. Anyway, if I had to do it again, I would have saved my $1000."
1,I do not recommend this TV,"Main picture board needs replacing after 18 months costing at least $350, or about half the cost of the TV. Customer support and warranty is non existent after first year."
1,Great Product; Horrible Service,"This is a great TV. Unfortunately, my TV only worked for 12 hours before it would not turn on again. My first reaction was that I got a defective model, but I understand that this sometimes happens. I immediately contacted Olevia regarding the warranty. Here's where things went south. Olevia did not respond to my numerous e-mails regarding the problem. I've spooken to their representatives on the phone a half a dozen times and while they finally agreed to replace the TV with a new one, I've yet to take delivery of the new unit after a month. They don't seem to be able to give a definitive answer on the problem OR the resolution. Very disappointing.Bottom Line: If your TV works, you're in for a treat as the picture quality is nice, with sound that can't be beat. However, if you have any problems and are counting on the warranty to fix them, you're in for a rough ride."
4,"Great deal for your money. But, beware of the sound quality.","I paid $699 for this set and I have to admit, even though I ought this for my bedroom, it can be a main room TV with it's picture quality. For an LCD, the HD channels come in sparkling. As for the SD channels, they look ok. But, you can tweak your setting a little (noise reduction) and the channels come in quite well. The rotary menu takes a little bit to get used to but is actually quite simple to navigate once you get the hang of it. It has more than enough composite and component inputs. However, it has only 1 HDMI input. No DVI input but somewhat makes up for it with SGVA input.I do have to complain about the sound quality. The on board speakers are pretty sorry to be nice. If you run a home theater system you will be fine. Otherwise you should turn the bass down to the mid level range and crank up the treble to about 70%. It sounds ok then.Again, for the money, you get a very good TV with some mediocre sound."
2,I was so surprised,"I have few words, but I have this model and It's sitting on my floor in front of my TV stand where my new TV is Sitting. That should sum it up for future buyers of this TV. YUK!"
1,Too many problems. Buy another brand.,"The directions supplied with the TV are crazy stupid. And I cannot believe not one person reviewing this product did not mention the problem with remote control.Cable remote control cannot be programmed to control the TV because Olevia customer service told me, ""our TV is too new and does not have codes yet"". So you will always have to use TV remote for volume and cable remote for channel control.Everything on this TV is BACKWARDS. A bright light on the front of the TV stays ""ON"" when TV is ""OFF"". Isn't the light suppose to go off when tv is off?Directions are wrong. You must choose source then click menu. The directions say the opposite. To choose an option you must click ""enter""' and the directions instead say click right arrow.The on-screen menu is confusing and plain aweful.Took me 2 hrs to set tv up when it should only take 10 minutes."
4,"Good TV, bad everything else.","I'm definitely pleased with much of this TV: The picture is excellent, the refresh rate is good for games, the speakers are surprisingly decent, and the connections on the back are more than adequate. Overall, it's a great TV and a great deal. What is lacking is this TV is, as some have already said, the menu system. It is absolutely atrocious. I have 2 Olevia TVs and both have the same crappy menu. I can name 100 ways in which it could be improved, but it's not worth it. In my opinion, this is not a deal breaker, and this is still a great TV. Only 2 other problems: The blue LED standby button is way too bright, and when you press power, the only feedback that the thing is turning on is that the LED goes off. You have to wait like 15-20 seconds before the backlight turns on. Strange and confusing..."
2,Issues,"Where is the QA department? Looked great at first. We hooked it up in our apartment and enjoyed good movies. We then threw away the box. It always seems the day after you dispose of the box, that the problems kick in. First: A vertical green line seems to appear after 15 minutes of the set being turned on. The line is to the right of center and stretches from the top to the bottom of the screen. Second: The audio 'pops' loudly every few minutes. Most people play their audio through a separate receiver and would never notice the poor amplification unit in the TV. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people. I guess the thing is still on warranty, so one of these days I will get around to reporting the problem to Amazon, the fulfiller or to Olevia. However, I am one of those busy people who doesn't have time for things that don't work out of the box. I am sure that if these two issues were resolved, I would be very happy with this unit, but like I said, who has the time?"
1,Junk,"Do not buy an Olevia TV. I had this TV for 14 months and the HDMI input quit working. No TV repair companies will touch an Olevia TV, I called at least five. They all told me Olevia TV's are what they refer to as 'throw away's'. If they break after the warranty is up, just throw it away. It is out of warranty, so I am out of luck. This seems to be a recurring problem with Olevia TV's. Customer service department is the worst I've ever seen, call ten times and get ten different answers."
2,Not So Good After All!,"I've had mine for almost two years with no problems at all. I found it to be very easy to set up, the picture and sound quality is also very good. And the price was excellent! It does seem like quite a few people have experienced problems with this brand but so far it's worked great for me.Update!Well just like everyone else I started having major problems with this television. I guess that's what happens when they use cheap low quality parts!My advice to everyone is to do your homework and check out the reviews before buying anything."
5,Revival,"I have been so blessed to read and interact with this book. Choosing to spend 30 days on this journey has revived my time with the Lord, has opened my eyes to new, creative things to draw me closer in my relationship with Him. Thank you, Catherine, for your work of faith and labor of love."
4,Shows Promise,"THE VESPER SERVICE MURDERS is only the second of the author's twenty-six books featuring Hugh North. Captain North is invited to participate in the investigation of a series of murders in the city of Deptford, Massachusetts. Dr. Walter Allan, a friend of North, is used as a narrator by Mason. North is already famous because of newspaper publicity about previous cases he has solved dating back to World War I army service in Europe. Knowledge of American Morse code is employed by North as a tool of detection in this case. The novel is written in the style of a police detective story and it shows the promise realized in the later entries in this series which deal entirely with espionage and international intrigue."
4,"Pretty good 70's prog metal, though it drags in spots","I knew nothing about Giant Squid, but I like most of what I've heard from The End Records, so I gave it a try. The musicianship is solid and the lyrics are interesting. Overall, it sounds *a lot* like Neurosis covering a System of a Down album.There aren't any guitar solos, and some tracks are instrumentals. The songs are long (and slow) enough to build a deep mood. Occasionally, like on the closing title track, it goes on too long and sounds like a jam session where the band keeps going until someone throws in a cool keyboard line. If you want to ""sink into"" the music, like with Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin, this CD is a must-have.""Metridium Field"" is a chill-out album for headbangers. It relies on a slow burn and depth of mood, instead of speed and flash. I would've enjoyed a *little* more tightening and structure in the songs, but that's just my preference rather than a good/bad assessment."
4,Excellent and Compelling Indie Prog-Rock,"One of the things I am enjoying about the music industry in general these days is the fact that left-of-center, non-formulaic music that combines elements of other genres and styles is now not only accepted, but becoming popular and selling well-something that would not have happened a few years ago. Giant Squid is a band that could be described as progressive rock, but that really sells them a bit short. I think the closest comparison I could make would be Dredg meets Enigma and Isis. Heavy, dense and hypnotic guitar riffs and soothing near-ambient music meet somewhere in the middle with ethereal vocals (both male and female) and both middle-eastern and latin-flavored melodies woven throughout. Very interesting and cool stuff. Fans of both Tool and Dredg would probably like this album, as the vocals are at times reminiscent of both bands. Recommended!"
2,"Good challenge but way overpriced - free, better options online","Now, I must say I didn't read the details when I ordered this product but I expected more than just around about 100 questions especially if you pay nearly $50! (Thankfully, there were cheaper offers on Amazon when I bought it, I would have been REALLY annoyed otherwise!)There are lots of free options if you need a tool for studying wine; e.g. The Bubbly Professor offers free quizzes on her webpage and some of them are advanced levels for sure. I just wish I had searched the web before I bought this product....It is kind of neat, the way it's designed but definitely not worth the $$."
1,the Disk did not work on my Mac,"It says Mac and Pc compatible, it did not work on my Mac. I needed this to study for a Sommelier course but it was a waste of money."
3,At least it's tiny.,"""Illuminate your life!"" says the package. But only if your life is very small and dark.The advantage here is that this flashlight is very small. I stuck one to my cell phone and it still fits in the case. But the two LEDs aren't very bright. They're good enough to help me get my key in the lock, but are pretty worthless unless you're within 2-4 inches of what you need to see."
1,Check your batteries!,"I'm sure this product works great, but it would have been nice to know that it only works with remotes that use AA batteries. You can't use it for a AAA battery remote."
1,"Not worth a ""dam""","This book suffers from its age, archaic style and paucity of meaningful diagrams or quality photographs. While it may have value for an advanced engineering student(especially a math junkie), it has little value to a land owner seeking practical advice on the construction of dams. For its relatively high price, there are probably better resources....including the Soil and Water Conservation Service."
5,Master Reference!,"This ""Hikers Bible"" is the most complete publication of it's kind on this subject that I own to date. Harry Evans has outdone most similar books by adding detailed topos with milage points clearly marked on the trail maps. With detailed information on each area, one feels like they have all ready been there. The photos are excellent!"
2,time-filler,find a job different from writing; my tax dollars actually paid this guy. I was Navy and had to work for my money.
4,This brought back memories.,"While a work of fiction, Mr. Griffiths' chapters have their basis in cold hard naval tradition. Any sailor reading this can readily identify with the tales, evoking experiences sometimes mislaid but never forgotten. Peruse this book and then find the nearest serviceperson and buy them a beverage. Or a hamburger. Then thank them. You'll feel better and make that serviceperson's week."
3,an average tale,"Can Remo and Chiun defeat another enemy who can't seem to be stopped? The story didn't really pull me in. Some parts had too much detail. The author did do a good job with the dialogue and relationships between the characters. This series needs a few strong books to get back on track.If you haven't already come across Destroyer World: New Blood be sure to pick up at least one copy. This book had the best Destroyer stories I've read in some time. If you search, you'll find it at warrenmurphy dotcom."
5,More beautiful than I pictured,The watch was more beautiful than I pictured and made a wonderful christmas gift!!
5,Good Gift,This makes a good gift for those that love the John Deere brand. I bought it for someone when they purchased a new tractor. Nothing runs like a deere :)
4,If you are a Nazarene--get this book,"An interesting book by Mark Quanstrom for Nazarenes interested in the shifts in holiness theology in the 20th century. He argues that there are two competing theories of holiness today-generally represented by Richard Taylor and Mildred Wynkoop. The book is only what it claims to be--the hundred-year story of the doctrine of holiness among Nazarenes... if you are not a Nazarene you'll be disappointed at how significant matters relating to changes in holiness doctrine that happened outside of the Church of the Nazarene are ignored or treated lightly. If you are a Nazarene buy it, if not wait until someone emerges about 2015 to write about the entire movement and not merely one denomination. (Maybe Donald Dayton?) --Keith Drury, Associate Professor of Religion, Indiana Wesleyan University </I>"
4,Sensuous to say the least,"What can I say other than it's the most sensuous CD this side of an ""X"" rating."
3,Nice but undeveloped and patchy,"Azam Ali is a creative performer but although this album has interesting arangements and nice funky sounds, it's not her best. It's a slight progression on her Vas albums, but I like Portals of Grace (based on Medieval music) and Nine Heavens (as Niyaz) better. The problem with Elysium is the melodic invention is weak, with the ooing and aahing not really going anywhere and generally like variations on a theme, so that one track sounds pretty much like the next. Even the rhythms don't vary that much. There's some nice moments, with a kind of retro feel a la Durutti Column, OMD or even snatches of Tangerine Dream, against an exotic Eastern-style backdrop. Portals of Grace is more inspired, very Gothic, and Nine Heavens is deeper and funkier. Both of those albums have a stronger traditional basis. Still if you like Azam's commercial side you'll enjoy Elysium, it's easy to listen to, but you may tire of it eventually, as there is not a whole lot of variety."
2,Unfortunate departure.,"Following Azam's homage to Barbara Thornton, ""Portals Of Grace,"" I found this album very disappointing."
4,InSinkErator CRD-00 Power Cord Kit,Expensive but very convenient when ordering and installing your garbage disposal unit. You can probably buy a similar product at your local hardware store for a lot less if you don't mind driving there and hopefully not forgetting something and having to go back to the store. Why isn't this included in the price of the Disposal Unit?
5,Shouldn't have to buy this but since you do...,Don't forget this when you purchase an Insinkerator it isn't included.I don't like that you have to buy so many accessories after spending $300 on a garbage disposal but at least they make it easy.
4,Decent Quality Works as designed.,"Cord is built to handle rated amps and that's all. Startup or surge amps if maintained in the event of a jam would cause cord failure if plugged into a 20 amp Circuit before breaker would Pop. Also would have been nice to mark the neutral since this is keyed, aka Grounded and can only plug one way, however you can figure it out as it should be the right side if ground plug is down. Other then those minor annoyances It works fine where you plug is within 3 Feet. Includes required wire nuts and collar. Use the collar without the nut on InSinkerator Garbage disposals."
5,If you've got an outlet I've got a plug in,This attaches to a InSinkErator and then powers it. The electricity runs through the wall then enters the cord which in turn powers the Badger food waste disposer.
3,Not what I expected.... (3.5),"Just a disclaimer to fans of El-P: he does not rap on this album, and he does not make hip-hop instrumentals. This is a jazz album by El-P. Same guy, completely different music.But as a jazz album, it is pretty impressive. This is not usually the direction his music takes, so I will admit it was unexpected. But it is a pretty good effort. He's no Coltrane, but it is an all right album. But if you're an El-P fan but not a jazz fan, just leave it alone."
3,interesting concept,"i think of this as madlib's ""shades of blue"" meets the production of el-p's ""fantastic damage."" i can actually pick out the beats from his songs that he used for some of these tracks. after reading the reviews, i decided to give ""high water"" a ride, and it's not as bad as a lot of others have deemed it. i feel that it has a loose, unstructured feel to it, which, can be ok at times, and at other times questionable. another gripe i have is that the cd is way too short; i would have liked to see at least 2 more tracks on here. my personal songs of interest include ""when the moon was blue"" (eerily wonderful) and ""intrigue in the house of india""."
4,Four open minded hip hop heads.,"This album is not recommended for closed minded El-p fans. If you like ambient neo jazz this is a pretty good CD. Combining soft, ambient jazz music with new age beats and synth, innovator El-p makes a his high water mark. 4 stars."
3,el-p/matthew shipp,"this is ok. when the moon was blue is really the sole banger. el should've dropped some fantastic damage ish on this record, not these weak atmospheric beats like something is wrong and sunrise over bk. i'd be more interested in hearing david murray play over el-p's ""deep space 9mm."""
2,el producto... did he even do anything on this record?,"I found this used and I found out why. It's simply wack. Even for a jazz record. I'm highly into jazz, but found myself skipping tracks and hearing trumpet players ad lib off-key. If El-p really was proud of this LP, he would have released it on Def Jux.When listening to this record you find that El-p has very little to do with this album. It apears as if he's just sitting in on the sessions and observing the muscians play. In other words, some record label thought they'd sell more units by saying El-p did it than say their muscians made the music.Interesting effort and expirement, but this album doesn't have any replay value."
1,Hopeless,"You know what's wrong with hip-hop? There's no there there, no res. So, I'm sorry to say, this disc isn't worth even the two stars I gave it on my first review. It just grows more annoying the more I hear it. With someone of the stature of Daniel Carter relegated to playing such inane music (not to mention Steve Swell, William Parker, Guillermo Brown, and Roy Campbell), Matthew Shipp should be embarressed to have allowed this offal, this abortion to see the light of day. One of the sorrier discs I've ever heard."
2,This book is over-rated,"I was a little disappointed by this book after reading all the positive... reviews. The book has its good points, offering no nonsense tips which would be useful for beginner body builders. As someone who has been working out for a while, I found the book did little but confirm what I already knew. The book is basically one guy's story about what has worked for him over the years. The editing is very amateur. The book contains basic spelling mistakes and is not very well organized. I felt this made the book harder to follow."
5,A sensible and inspiring approach to bodybuilding,"When I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. Frank Melfa's writing inspired me, as the previous writer put it, I felt like he was speaking directly to me. Having applied Frank's advice in the gym and to my diet, I have lost eight pounds and busted through a three-month long plateau! Frank shows you how to do the exercises, the kinds of routines that can be done, different lifting techniques, and how to attain your goals. What is really the most inspiring is the pictures are mostly of him, showing that using his methods you too can attain a great physique. I would recommend this book to anyone at any level wishing to build muscle, tone muscle, or just plain lose weight. Frank will teach you the right way and with dedication you will reach your goals."
4,Panorama actual de la poesía hablada en Hispanoamérica,"Con este libro, Rosa Montero (profesora asistente de Español en la Universidad de Toronto) ha elaborado un estudio muy interesante sobre el uso del lenguaje coloquial en el trabajo de varios y contemporáneos poetas latinoamericanos (Raúl González Tuñón, Nicanor Parra, Ernesto Cardenal, Rosario Castellanos, y Luisa Futoransky)Los trabajos del estudio seleccionados por Rosa Montero son analizados en el contexto de otros hilos de la crítica y teoría literaria incluyendo teoría de la percepción, feminismo, ideología, etc. Un estudio muy interesante que nos acerca a los poetas de la palabra hablada en español. Muy recomendable."
2,not worth it,"i got this for my wife kinda as a joke but even so she read it and found it to be funny and ridiculous. apparently writing for women means being overly flowery, tons of pointless set up and doesn't really go anywhere meaningful. Basically no kind of turn on at all."
3,"Slow Hand, Women Writing Erotica","Erotica can be many things and 'Slow Hand' offers a delightful exploration of the thoughtful, sensual side of erotica. It explores themes of sexual suggestion and body consciousness and attempts to reveal how women think and feel. Refreshing and lovely but definitely tame. For a full range of erotic audio stories, from tame to very tarty, please visit my site www.awomansgoodnight.com"
3,A tiny vortex,"I picked this up at the library, curious not because I'm a boomer but because my father is, and read it on the subway ride home. No book, no film, no artifice has ever left me feeling as disconsolate and crushed as The Boomer. The lesson, as I interpreted it, is this: Prolonged happiness is impossible, since success is empty, love fails you, and you can't outrun your growing capacity for pleasure and acquisition. I think cars are the only things in this book that are given names.I can't articulate a rating for The Boomer. Three stars is an arbitrary selection. It affected me -- it wounded my interior. I see my father in it, and I know that he would see himself, and yet he has never cautioned me (as the book does not caution) against absorbing the disconnective malaise of his life. Sending him this book would be an act of terrorism.On the subway ride home: how easy it was to read something so hard."
5,HILARIOUS!!,The Boomer is one of the funniest books ever written. It is my daily go to book to entertain not only my friends but myself. I love it. Will read it over and over.
4,Stick your head in an oven after reading it,"A good book but you'll feel like sticking your head in an oven after reading it. I found it looking for all the books in my local library in the category ""Experimental Fiction."" It has a drawing on almost every page to accompany the text. It is the pessimistic story of a boomer's life from birth to death, as the protagonist struggles through life's stages in a fruitless pursuit of happiness. Its kind of cynical and reminds me of the thinking of my father's generation (survivors of the Depression and veterans of World War II). Its a small format with few pages and is a very quick read."
3,The Boomer.....Like a puppy,"How can a novel titled ""The Boomer"" purport any mimetical validity when it totally ignores the once-daunting spectre of Vietnam, a defining shadow that fell in some way on nearly every real boomer's life? Real boomers sweated flunking out and getting drafted; or graduating, and then getting drafted; or girl friend gets pregnant then getting...etc, ad naus. Everyone had their best-case-worst-case scenarios and the psychic oil-spill of Vietnam anxiety glommed on to us all. Major quibble aside, this little book is nifty, its neat, and my wife says it's the cutest I've ever bought, like a puppy almost. The graphics and design by Chip Kidd are nothing but ace and first rate and this guy should be a star. It's unfortunate the main(only) character should be such a glib and vacuous loser. ""The Boomer"" is not I. Who he?"
3,"Good info, but very basic & repetitive","The information in this book is helpful and worth reading, but could be condensed from 100 pages to about 30 because of the repeated messages throughout the book. For example, the advice of doing a standing back bend after sitting for a period of time must have been written 10 different times.I believe that one of the biggest benefits of reading ANY book for back pain is that it makes you start to think more about your back and how to care for it throughout the day. So this book serves as a source for some good stretches as well as being a conscious reminder to focus on back health."
5,Simple and Effective Back Advice,"So many times when you get these type of books they are hard to understand and difficult to follow. Why Does My Back Hurt So Much? makes it easy. It was fun to read and the pictures open my eyes to several bad habits I didn't even know I had. It covered many areas of my life such as my workplace, sleeping habits, yardwork, and recreational times. Thanks for writing a back book that is simple and effective."
3,Buyer Beware,"Though this item is called ""HP USB Multimedia Keyboard "", I received a PS/2 keyboard rather than a USB keyboard when I ordered it. The good news (sort of) is that a PS/2 to USB adapter can be found online (via a Froogle search) which costs less than $5 (US, before shipping). The bad news is that the USB format, for some reason, does not support all those ""Multimedia"" buttons on the top row above the ""F"" buttons.While I haven't had the opportunity to actually type while it's connected to my computer (still waiting for the adapter), I did try it out with it unconnected and have no complaints with ergonomics, layout, etc. Pretty much a standard keyboard."
1,HP Customer service - NO RESPONSE x2,"Great keyboard if you use the dinosaur aged PS/2 connection. But like most of us who have usb connections who bought the adapters can't use all the neat lil buttons that come on this keyboard. NONE of them! I have a KVM switch and was hoping to use this for two computers. I can use it, but only the main functions of the keyboard...none of the hot keys..HUGE disappointment I've written customer support twice asking them for a fix and a year later still nothing. Not even a rsponse. I've suggested them putting out a usb version of the keyboard..nothing. So no uodated drivers and no usb version. Unless you have a ps/2 slot DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
1,It's crap.,"This is a cheap, nasty piece of crap. The bowl gets way to hot and if you try to use it you will be constantly inhaling pieces of shaved plastic and plastic tasting tobacco. I guess it would be ideal for kids and fancy dress, but this is truely a horrendous pipe and not even worth the price.If this was the only pipe I had and found out the world would end in half an hour, I still wouldn't use this. I would not want to slip my mortal coils with the taste of cheap chinese plastic in my mouth and burn marks on my fingers from the poorly designed bowl."
1,"Comfortable, but does not hold air","Great idea, inflates easily and is comfortable, however it does not stay inflated. Woke up several times during the night, and had to reflate. Spent several hours trying to find leak, I think it is somewhere in the pump assembly. If this leaking problem could be solved, I would rate this product with 5 Stars"
1,"Used twice, doesn't hold air anymore","Same thing as the others. I had a similar mattress (a queen size.) After two uses and being stored correctly it started losing air. I can't find the leak anywhere, even tried the old water/bubble trick. The one place I couldn't try it was near the pump, which I think is likely where it is. Don't buy. I spent $90 on mine and it was such a waste of money."
2,Air leaks through battery compartment,"We bought two mattresses for car camping and to take on visits to relatives, and so they are used only 3-4 times a year. After two years, both units develop an air leak through the battery compartment which cannot be fixed with any patches. Unfortunately, air mattresses are becoming nearly disposable, but I expected more from the Eddie Bauer brand.For my next purchase, I will get one with an external pump. There is no point in each mattress having its own pump. It means more batteries to worry about and more seals that can fail."
5,Great mattress,This is a great mattress that inflates quickly and is VERY comfortable! Worth every penny!
1,Disappointed,"Copyright is actually 2001. No book headings, page headings nor chapter headings. Very plain edition. Harmony of the Gosples section does not have a good layout, not easily read. Hardly any room at all in the margins for notes. Not impressive at all. The British tan cover is the best part of this edition. I received it in the mail just a short time before the local bookstore closed for the holidays, so I hurried there to have my name imprinted. If I had just taken time to look it over, I would have requested a refund. However, since I have now imprinted my name on the cover, I doubt that a refund is possible.This review is for the KJV edition of this Bible."
3,Ruark he ain't,"Ian Manning's safari memoir would have benefitted greatly from a better editing job. While many of the anecdotes are entertaining, the book is nothing more than a string of them in roughly chronological order. There is no theme, no pacing, and every event is treated with equal weight, whether it is a drunken prank or a tragic death. The book reads like a virtually unedited journal, except that Manning is fuzzy on so many details that he obviously isn't working from a complete contemporaneous diary. But Manning isn't a professional writer, and perhaps he shouldn't be held to too high a standard; his ediitors have no such excuse. If you like safari yarns, and you already have a shelf full of Selous, Baker, Finaughty, Ruark and Capstick, you might want to add this one to your collection, but all the above are much better writers."
1,Not clearly listed and unnecessary,"Becareful!! This is not listed clearly... it is only the meeting book and not the student workbook. I ordered this under the impression it was the workbook as the listing implies and found out the hard way. Amazon would not refund my shipping cost. I was very disappointed.If you have a calendar, can draw a graph for weather, type up a 100s chart, and practice patterning you do not need this book anyway.Definitely go for the student workbook and the teacher's manual, it has all you will need. We absolutely love the Saxon program. My daughter has raced through it and can't wait to do math each day."
1,Saxon Home Study MEETING Book...NOT Textbook!!!,Can't believe this item is still listed this way...Just bought it...very disappointed! Will try to work with Amazon further to correct problem and listing.
1,not what it sounds like,"there is nothing to do with math practice for grade 1 students. dont waste your money. it is basically some blank charts to fill in when ""meeting"" but there is no content."
1,Saxon Meeting Book,This is inaccurately labeled - Should be sold as Saxon Meeting Book - NOT WORKBOOK
1,Markers dry out very quickly!,"The case these markers come in is great! However, the markers themselves are of very poor quality, they dried out within a couple of weeks, and my daughters kept the caps on them."
2,NO Instructions with product,"I love the idea of this pan but received no instructions or recipes with the product. I tried to bake muffins twice. The first time I overbaked & they were dry. The second time they were raw! I am not an baker so would appreciate any HELP I could get on recipes, amount of batter to put in pan, etc."
1,Utterly vile,"Holocaust denial is a hate crime. So too should be Holodomor (Great Famine) denial. This is a book that has no place on the shelves of anyone other than a member of a police Hate Crimes unit. It is utterly pro Soviet, anti-Ukrainian, and, of course, very dated. Mr Tottle never did explain why the government of post Soviet Ukraine has acknowleged that the Great Famine was man-made, confirming that many millions of people died needlessly during 1932-33 as a result of Stalinist policies, even setting aside the 4th Saturday of every November for a national day of mourning. The Great Famine was probably the greatest act of genocide to have ever taken place in 20th century Europe. That is only now being full appreciated. Tottle's book will be remembered, if at all, as an example of a last gasp by the Soviet regime to try and befoul the Ukrainian national liberation movement. The latter won, whereas folks like Tottle have, properly, ended up on the dust bin of history."
2,Amusing historical curiosity,"This book -- which purported to ""debunk"" the Holomodor (Ukrainian Famine) -- was hurriedly withdrawn when the (then) Soviet party chief of the Ukraine admitted that the famine had, in fact, occurred. Hard to find, but not really worth the price."
5,Quest Gamma-ray rocket build,"Quest, Gamma-Ray #2004This was my first rocket build with a payload compartment. What was very helpful in building the rocket was the easy to read instructions with ""pictures"". I noticed that these balsa fins are very hard & stiff, different from the thinner ones in the past. The ""hint given"" on gluing the fins on the tube worked like a charm, as I just used white glue. Less glue is better and let it get sticky on both surfaces of the tube and fin before aligning the fin on the tube. The fin will grab on the tube like a magnet and be easy to align straight up and dry quicker so you can attach the next fin.This rocket flew perfect with a B engine and the payload came back down alive and well. I would definitely recommend this rocket to build and fly and on my next flights, I'm going to use different weights in the payload compartment to see how it affects the height of the rocket.duke"
4,Worth reading to set up an EA program,"IF you are looking to set up a new Enterprise Architecture program for your organization, this book outlines the steps you should follow. Please note that it doesn't teach you how to be an Enterprise Architect."
2,Ambitious but disappointing,"I kept waiting for this book to seem humorous, entertaining, and insightful but that didn't happen for me. Beatrice and her family never seemed convincing. The book reminded me of early John Irving, but it's not nearly as good. Couldn't figure out if the parents were insane, trashy, shabby-genteel or what. The only mildly amusing characters were the lesbians Beatrice falls in with. I don't know why the author set the book in the Seventies--the period didn't seem too important for the story, and there were a few anachronistic details that were annoying. I don't think ""swiping"" credit cards or frequent flier miles existed in the seventies, or that the even/odd days for gasoline lasted the entire decade. Overall, not recommended."
4,Mastering Safety Communication,"Mastering Safety Communication is a very readable book, easily accomplished within a two hour flight. It is a handbook on skills to make communication with others more effective. It contains methods anyone can try with co-workers, family and friends and be immediately successful!"
1,Worst Pan Ever,"This pan is a piece of junk, I don't understand or believe it's possible for anyone to give this pan 1 star never mind 5. when it gets hot it warps out of shape with the food on it. It's only been used for about 2 months and already the meat sticks to it. This is the only product I have ever been unhappy with..."
1,You get what you pay for.,"This broiler pan warped in the oven the very first time I used it. Now since it does not lay flat, the meat juices spill out and it slides all over the over rack. It was inexpensive so I got what I paid for."
1,Complete waste of money,"I bought this because it was the only one I could find on the internet. I was disappointed with it from the outset - the non-stick surface wore off very quickly - the pan warped the first time I broiled with it - and even before the non-stick surface wore out it wasn't very easy to clean. One year later I am ready to toss the thing out, but I can't do that until I locate another broiler pan."
1,More sculpture than broiler,"My experience with this pan is that it lies flat when cool, but when heated and place beneath a broiler, it warps and twists into odd shapes. My chicken breasts or steaks would literally slide to the lowest end of the rack. It was a major frustration. I threw away the rack and now my German Shepherd eats from the lower pan."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE!,"I completely agree with the other reviewers. This product is so bad. It warps under the heat, the not-so-non-stick surface peels, and food sticks like glue."
3,Has held up longer than most others,"My dog still chewed the edges of it and then I worry about him choking on the strings, but I trimmed them down. The toy itself is still intact, which is a miracle. He likes to play tug of war with it."
4,Still tough,"My Whippet went through a Tuffy Bone in about 4 years, and that's about 200 times longer than most fabric toys. This is bigger but there isn't really an up-side to its size. It's a bit floppy so throwing it for fetch can have it veer wildly off course. No more propensity to play tug-of-war than with their standard bone. If you couldn't tell, I'd rather just have the smaller bone."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this toy for my mom's Labradoodle for Xmas. Since it was supposed to be practically ""indestructible"" I thought we'd give it a try and see how long it took her to tear it apart. I was a little disappointed it only took her about a coule of days before the toy was ""toast"". Sad. I was hoping for at least a couple of months based on the claims of the product. She seems to keep her ""Walmart Babies"" alive longer than this toy. Not worth the price or the claims."
3,Not even this was tuff enough!,"My dog is only 9 months old, but smart enough to find the one open string on this toy to start a tear. So I took it away and will let him have it in his mellow years. It is very cool though. Big, well made, just not perfect. Will need to stick to the hard plastic toys for awhile."
5,Long Lasting Product,I have two golden retriever / hound mix pups. About 1 years old and 80 lbs of muscle. They have gone through almost every toy within 48 hrs of buying. This one has lasted a month so far with no rips and has survived many tug -o- wars. I will definitely buy more of this brand when I feel the need to spoil my pups!1
2,"Nope...failed....and we don't have ""chewers""",In about 15 minutes one of our dogs had the seams on this thing frayed all over the toy.Not very tough.This company DOES make some tough products - but this isn't one.
2,destroyed in minutes,"My dog destroyed this toy within minutes. she isnt gentle with toys, but it lasted just as long as a stuffed animal would. i wouldnt waste the money because this toy isnt going to last...."
2,Nice design but not strong enough,"I bought the toy for my basset hound and lab to play tug-o-war with, within thirty minutes my lab chewed through it. The next day the toy was 75% gone, did not last long. My lab is 2 years old and has different chew toys that have lasted a while. I was really surprised how easily this went. will never buy again."
1,Slightly better than other toys,"Well, I think we may have a new record of destruction for this toy. It has lasted 3 days with my 45 pound lab/pit mix. She destroys all chew toys in her path....and this one is no different. Well, it lasted longer than the chew toys she got for Christmas."
2,Not indestructible,"I had high hopes for this tug toy, but my very aggressive chewer had it ripped open and the stuffing pulled out within a week. I"
4,Tough Tuffy's Toy,This toy is as described and appears to be of good quality. It has stood up to tug-of-war with my strong coonhound who loves to present it to us to tug with him.
3,Not a review,"To the writer of the review above,Eulogy is not about Kurt Cobain and is most certainly not about Jesus, although that may be what the band wants casual listeners to think. In fact, the song is most probably about the band's most loved but deceased comedian, Bill Hicks. Please see this document for some of the most insightful interpretations of the songs that I have seen on the net:http://www.vanillacircus.net/book/tool_book.pdfThe only thing I notice that he has wrong is the interpretation of ""Part of Me,"" which is clearly about masturbation. About the item above, I have a hard time trusting any documentary about Tool when it's not even authorized by the band."
1,The trashing of Frank,"If you loved the first two or three Pixies albums, but nothing else that Charles Thompson has ever been involved with, you might enjoy this book. If you are a fan, you will wonder why someone spent so much time and effort writing a book about a band led by someone he obviously thinks died creatively 15 years ago. If you relish suffering through hundreds of run-on sentences and trying-so-desperately-hard-to-be-clever-but-only-succeeding-at-being-obscure-trite-and-ultimately-meaningless blarney, this is the book for you! Somewhat informative and a few good black and white photos, but mostly editorial crap. To say I hated it would be petty (like the author of the book), but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,Gigantic : the story of the author's ego (0 stars),"This is the worst biography ever published. The author is not clever or witty as i'm sure he believes himself to be. (he refers to himself as ""Gigantic"" in the 3rd person; what else needs to be said?) Clever if you consider that he's probably making money from the sale of this book on the strength of a great subject (pixies) and a cool cover. In addition to having no interviews with the band that weren't lifted from other sources, half of the book isn't even about the pixies. Every other chapter of this book is a short fictional work about a fan who becomes obsessed with Charles Thompson (Frank Black). This is just a cheap bait & switch to increase the thickness of the book and make it appear as if the author actually has something worth saying. Trust me no pixie fan, no matter how huge, could possibly find anything of value in this book."
3,interesting,"Unlike most of the other reviews I found this book interesting. It was as bad as some of these reviewers said. It could have been worse. There were some chapters of fiction, that I had no use in the book, but other than that it was all right. In fact if the fiction part was longer it could have been published as a different book. I am not saying that someone should buy it. If it is being given away for free then it would be a good book to pick up. I mean the time i spent reading it was all right. I did not really piece all the bad things about it together until i read other reviews, and that sort of made me not like it as much. Oh well."
1,Part 1 Helena's little book of horror stories,Great stuff for the next halloween campfire. These stories are really scary to tell and fun to watch the kids get invovled and then they can add to the story on their own. just to see creativity added to on this level allows one to see the creative mind of ms. helena doesn't go far enough to quench the thurst and craving for scary tales!
2,Not quite as good as these used to be,"I've had a pair like this since 2009, which is when I fell in love with the design. Once the old pair was worn out, I went and reordered.My first misgivings came when I saw these are now manufactured in Dominican republic as opposed to US, and look definitively lopsided, couldn't tell left from right.The final bell rung when two weeks into the wear the right heel seam parted.We all understand cutting costs, but such shoddy quality doesn't warrant the price anymore."
4,Comfy Mocassins,"These things are the best. They are so soft and comfortable. Only reason they didn't get a 5 star was because they are a little smaller for the size. Size 13 is usually big on me, but these were tight, but after a few times wearing them, they feel great."
1,inaccurate product description,"My complaint is with the Minnetonka Moccasin company itself: On their web site, Minnetonka describes their entire category of sheepskin slippers as ""genuine sheepskin,"" but according to the tag inside, these particular slippers are made with a leather upper and ""balance man made materials,"" not with actual sheepskin.I have nothing bad so say about the seller; I received my order promptly, the slippers look nice and are well constructed, and it looks like they pulled their product description from the manufacturer's web site.Finally, for anyone else who was frustrated in their search for country of origin info, these were made in the Dominican Republic."
2,Very comfortable; warm; size runs small -- Poor quality,"I had originally given this moccasin 5 stars because it is very warm and comfortable, despite that the sizes (I bought two pair) run two sizes too small. However, after only about a year of minimal use, there is already a hole in the seam. Find a cheaper moccasin."
4,Good Slippers,"These slippers are solid. I got them early in September and have last well since and surprisingly don't smell. They are very comfy. I have wide feet and at first they were a bit narrow, but after breaking them in they fit great. The two issues I have with these slippers is 1. The laces become untied easily (I'm just lazy and hate having to tie them) 2. There's this hard plastic piece in the heal that started poking me after awhile, but I realized that you can take it out and after taking them out the slippers feel great. It's just a thin piece of plastic that suppose to keep the heal upright, but I just prefer to have it out and they still hold up great. Overall I definitely recommend them, just keep in mind these are indoor slipper so don't expect to be going outside with them or else the bottoms could get ruined."
2,Narrow,"Sadly, these slippers run very narrow. I have the ladies version and love them but when I bought these for my boyfriend (who does not have wide feet) they were painfully narrow and had to be returned. We are hoping the hardsole version is a bit more forgiving."
5,Perfect,This is exactly what I was wanting. I wear them every night. So soft! A little on the pricey side though.
5,A great buy!,These slippers were exactly what I expected - great quality - my husband says a great fit - and a great deal for the money - worth every penny!
1,Learn to sow!,I loved my slippers for about a month! The seam parted at the back of the heel and I sent them back. I read other reviews and the same thing has happened. Apparently they have a quality problem that has not been corrected. If I'm assured the quality issues have been resolved I would consider ordering another pair!
5,Bought for my brother-in-law,"I purchase these for my brother-in-law as a gift, because the first pair he had, he ripped a hole in. He had his other ones for 3 years. He loves them, the only problem is that he taped his old ones together, and doesn't want to ware the new ones as he's scared they will rip also."
1,John Boy Walton,They sent me two left shoes so I'm hoping they send me a complete pair soon. Then I'll be happy!!
1,Minnetonka Mens Sheepskin Moccasins.,"My husband loves his shoes, we had a little problem getting them, but the product is great., the shipper was able to get the shoes to us, not by Christmas but it was OK, I don't get upset about that, stuff happens! Thanks Elizabeth Barker"
2,National Enquirer with Literary Pretensions,This author is so deep into tittle-tattle that she forgets to write about her subject. A judicious editing would have helped this dreary bio immensely.
1,This item was put in the wrong listing.,"This item was put in the FOOD thermos catagory. It is NOT a food thermos. It is for liquids, such as coffee, tea, ice-tea etc. I bought this item as a food thermos, for soups & beaf stew. It is not. Why Amazon put in the FOOD THERMOS catagory, I have no idea. Not very happy about what I got, but I will keep it for someone else. G"
3,costly learning,Found out that stainless steal themos is good for keeping cold liquids cold; but not for keeping coffee hot.
5,Excellent thermos,"This stainless bottle will keep liquids cold for over 24 hours, even after leaving it in a hot car. It's large size allows me to carry cold water all day as I travel."
4,great,just started taking not sure of results yet. hope all will help with the health i am looking for this year
3,So so,I have been using this for a few weeks and don't notice any difference. Will give it a little while longer.
5,Great supplement,"Unless there is a placebo effect, this supplement seems to really work for me along with a smart and thoughtful diet. Diet and exercise to me are #1."
3,Not for everyone,"I have been taking this exact product for months now. At first, I was very optimistic that it was taking the edge off, albeit ever so slightly. I have increased the dosage to 1200mg and feel no change other than what I noticed at the beginning, which was not much at all. I would even say that could have been a placebo effect. Perhaps this product just doesn't work for me personally."
1,SAM-E lingering side effects even after stopping,"I took 100 mg (half of a 200 mg pill) of SAM-E six days ago, only once, and then discontinued it. Now six days later, I am still having dry mouth, disturbed sleep, and nightmares.The brand I used was Nature Made.Does anyone know how long these lingering side effects will last, after taking SAM-E only once?I would advise anyone to be very careful with SAM-E, and beware of lingering side effects even after stopping it.Any help would be appreciated."
2,Shipped different brand,"The listing shows Nature Made, which is what I usually buy, but I was sent nutralife. Also, the boxes look they've been run over by a truck."
2,This is quite possibly one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.,I just couldn't make it past the half-way mark. I was too bored. The acting was terrible and the plot was worse than boring.
2,Murphy's Law,"I think the title of this book should be Murphy's Law. I enjoy fast easy enjoyable reads just as much as the next guy, but this book made me roll my eyes with every chapter. Whatever could go wrong, does go wrong. This book was just exasperating to read because it was so out there and unbelievable. I was frustrated so much at times that I just put it away.I didn't care about the main characters because one was distant and the other was whiney. I liked the supporting characters more than the main characters, but even they were rather empty. It wasn't an unbearable read, but I would definitely not recommend this when there are so many other great stories out there (Tales of the City series and Boyfriend Material)."
4,Clever and witty--a true delight!,"A most enjoyable book that will make you laugh and keep you as engrossed as any thriller. The characters are well drawn. The plot is very original. The writing smooth, concise, and witty. It is what is termed ""beach reading"", yes. But I think it would be extremely dangerous to read this one at the beach. Not being able to put it down you would be out in the sun much too long and probably suffer from three-degree burns. Besides, it's sunny enough."
5,My favorite gay novel of summer 2003,"Fast moving, entertaining, light, with a great crossover of the coming-out, godfather, and gay-travel genres."
3,Variation on Tales From The Crypt or Hood *No Spoilers*,"Group of people want to get into a club, so they tell scary stories. The premise isn't anything too special but there aren't many movies like it. The director decided to tell the stories as an anthology rather than one solid movie. I bought it on a whim since I saw the actress from Ghosts of Edendale in it. She improved a lot in performance and style.Make up - Not the best I've seen, but not horrible either. I could believe the dead bodies. That werewolf did look pretty good.The stories themselves were not inspired. They were just variations on themes already seen.I don't want to give spoilers here, so I won't. Buy the movie, but don't expect great things. It was entertaining."
1,luminous wind up clock,The clock has a very loud ticking noise and I could bought a cheaper one at Wal-Mart for half the price. The clock is better than the one I purchase from Amazon.
4,"Although a wack job, completely intersting","This books shows us an extreme side to McCarthy and makes one wonder how he even came into power. This book is full of his ranting and ravings about communism and the threat they bring to America. This is a very book, but at the same time can't be taken serously. He is extremely fascinating though because of his extreme views on situations. It is filled with obivious lies and makes one wonder if even himself believed what he was saying. This is a book looking into the mind of a deeply distruped individual. Highly recommended."
1,Do not Buy,This raging alcoholic was a cancer in Americas colon and he finally got pooped out when he died. Good Riddance.
3,Sensicare be for an adult?,I am an adult and a friend gave me a tube of Sinsi-Care 3. I don't have a baby but I'd like to know if this has beneficial use for an adult.
2,Aquaphor is better,"This is a great barrier cream, but I have found that Aquaphor for babies works better on his diaper rash and is less messy to remove/place."
4,works as advertised,"Have purchased several of these holders for car and RV. They work fine for securely holding cell phones and are adjustable. There is some flexibility on how you can install brackets; forget the vent installation option - too flimsy. The exchangeable front brackets are supposed to be ""high tech"" and attractive, I guess, maybe for teenagers."
5,A picture is worth 1000 words right? Right!,We found this collection of images to be a good resource and study guide. And although it is not a bound-book in the traditional sense (it is a nice collection of finely detailed photos and drawings you can keep in a three-hole binder) I especially like it b'cuz it is easy to remove just single page to examine more closely - you dont have to carry an extra book around. This is more a supplemental study guide than a stand alone text. The images are beautiful and I'm Glad to have it!
4,Good buy,"Bought on line because it was about $20 cheaper than in the book store at school. New and unused, so worked as expected."
4,"Good now, getting less good every day","But that, of course, isn't really this particular book's fault, but rather the reality for any printed survey of a topic that's constantly evolving. Like previous reviewers have said, you might want to just checkout the allmusic web site, unless you're a freakishly obsessed collector or are using a gift certificate and feeling a little more free than usual with what you buy (like me)."
4,From Kraftwerk to Amon to Aphex Twin,"Just a reply to Matthew here in terms of the prolificness of Amon Duul compared to the Prodigy. Theres absolutely nothing prolific about the Prodigy, not compared to the real innovators from Amon Duul to Kraftwerk to Aphex Twin ( who is the king of all electronic music the last decade). Amon Duul is extremely important in a lot of the electronic music groundwork, so thats why there are 2 and a half pages compared to the Prodigy , who are just a pop/dance band and merely entertaining to watch.It's not about who ones likes , its about who truly is and was important in electronic music. It's good to be diverse in liking different styles and all that, even though I dont understand liking a true innovator such as an Aphex Twin in the same vein as Armin van Buuren, DJ Tiesto, Ferry Corsten or Anti-loop who are the most one dimensional, generic/teeny bopper-techno acts/Dj's around."
3,"It's no ""The Stolen Child""","I am a huge fan of Paul Cody, but I never felt like he really reached into the story to the point where we were really involved. It didn't leave the lasting images in my mind as ""The Stolen Child"" certainly did, and ""Eyes Like Mine"" managed. I'm not disappointed, really, I just feel that his most rewarding scenes for the reader came when we were in voice of characters, instead of the sometimes elusive NOW or THEN scenes. I also found it disconcerting when we jump to the electric chair so suddenly when the father is walking with him. It was a long jump in time, maybe three weeks or a week, even, to just an hour or more. I did think it offered an interesting portrait of someone who kills and the motive that no one else is capable of seeing. The main character is certainly a curious and interesting character, but the book overall left me wanting more."
2,Puts me to sleep,Don't read this book in the evening after working all day. Its boring. Probably a good source if you know nothing about programming. But should you know something. Its tedious to read through.
4,Prata's C++ primer plus,"I bought the book used, so expected it to be a little worn. It was in relatively good shape! Great book for anyone learning, or relearning (in my case) how to program in C++. Also a great reference book for any programmer to add to their library. Delivery took longer than it should have; I ordered boots from another company a day after I ordered this book and the boots arrived 3 days before the book."
3,C-style book,"I agree with Mr.Eric Martin (see his review at beginning):The author is indead not a teacher of C++, may be of C!The author seems to think in C-style while trying teach real C++ - stuff. I stopped reading this book when Mr. Prata tried to teach real C++-stuff like classes, class templates and STL etc."
5,For newbies,"Great, this book is absolutely great.I'm a python coder with no experience in c++ but this book make light in a lot of dark corners of OOP with c++If you are a newbie this must be your book."
3,I returned this one,"I got this book along with Object-Oriented Programming in C++ by Robert Lafore, and I have to admit I prefer the Lafore book quite a lot more. I find Primer Plus to skip around a lot, and by the 4th chapter I was losing my way a little. I guess what really frustrated me the most was the problem solutions you can download offline only gave solution to 3 or 4 problems, and if its not the one you are doing then you are out of luck. I returned the book and just stuck with the Lafore text."
5,This book achieves the stated goals.,"This isn't a book for c++ gurus who are looking to learn a few more state of the art tricks, nor is it a heavy reference for programmers of that class. However, this book is a superb starting place(primer) for new programmers and/or new to c++ programmers. It also does an admirable job of serving as a reference book. (...)To sum it up: If you are new to C++, buy this book now! If you are still learning the trade as a C++ programmer, this book will help to refresh your memory and/or help you to get a better grasp of OOP concepts. If you know C++ very well, go elsewhere;)"
2,A good thing to try if it's free,"Well, my stereo fades in and out on every single station no matter how strong the signal is or even if its AM or FM, it is really annoying so I though I woult try this. I hooked it up and there was basically no difference at all. If it helped I didn't notice, it still fades in and out. I had some gift cards so this only cost me like $1.XX and for that price its a good try, but it really didn't do anything so I would keep looking.Good Luck"
2,Not a filter but antenna thing,"I cracked open the case to see whats inside of the ""noise filter"". Its an inductor (LP filter) on the ground wire (ok good) and the antenna signal wire, from your antenna, is NOT connected! You see, its suppose to mount somewhere high on the dash and replace your antenna. Its own antenna, (a little plate on the board I think), replaces your cars.I pulled in better AM stations since that is where I was getting all kinds of noise as expected. But I lost sensitivity on FM where my radio lost weaker FM sooner.I decided to remove it and just go back to check that all my grounding is ok. My car uses a back window strip, has less gain and more induced noise, instead of a pole antenna. I would buy it to improve some AM reception, but you must mount it high under or on the dash for it be effective. Mine came without instructions, it just has some writing on the bottom where a mounting board mentions mounting."
3,Didn't do what I hoped it would do.,I was looking for a way to get the noise off my AM radio in my electric golf cart. This seemed like a good possibility but did not do it. Probably not the fault of the product as it wasn't intended for this application. Oh well.
2,Nothing new!,"If you are new to new age and/or insiprational literature, then, may be you will get something out of this book. otherwise, there is nothing new in this book that is not already presented in a better, more original format elsewhere. Read Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra, Louis Hay to get more original thoughts on the same topic."
2,Don't waste your money.,"Actually bought a full size at Target. Don't be fooled by the Eddie Bauer name. After about 3 1/2 months of use the bed would not hold any air. Called Eddie Bauer to see what they could do. Come to find out, Target only BORROWED the Eddie Bauer name, so item is not made by Eddie Bauer company at all, so you cannot get problem resolved by Eddie Bauer. Called Target to see what I could do because refund date had expired. Gave me the manufacturer which was not Eddie Bauer. Bottom line, I got the run around. Ended up wasting my $60. Do yourself a favor and get an Aero bed."
1,Just Doesn't Work,"In the end, it doesn't matter how comfortable an air mattress may be or what features it has. If it doesn't hold air, it's no good. Such is the case with the two of these we purchased. They were out of air by 3-4 a.m. From now on, I'm sticking with Aero. The air bed of theirs I have is flawless."
4,Bluegrass with a twist.,Unique group. I am glad to have added it to my collection of Americana roots music. Great listening.
4,Buy it for the bowed bass (and cello),This is the first bluegrass-flavored music I've ever heard that goes wild in the lower registers.
2,Disappointed,"I am an experienced senior manager and do quite a bit of leadership development activities in group settings. I find metaphors a powerful tool to get a point across. So I bought this book, based on the reviews, so as to find out how to expand the metaphorical examples into more complete stories. While the first part of the book about how to find, construct and use stories in training is helpful, the stories themselves - including the audio of each on the included CD - left me totally cold. The readings in the audio versions are forced and unauthentic, and the stories themselves are a lot less useful than something developed from one's own experience or news stories. The book was pretty much a waste of money in my opinion."
5,Color is amazing,"The blue is simply amazing. It is wonderful quality and heavy. If you need a butter dish, this is the one to get. All Le Creuset stuff is amazing."
5,Worth the price,My grandson's dad says this gift from me had very important tips that have helped his 13 year old. They view it and then practice the methods.
3,art eraser,"I purchased the eraser as a requirement for a music composition class. I did like the way it erased, but hated dealing with all of the pieces of eraser all over the place every time it was used."
3,retractable windshield car cover,"It arrived quickly. It provides good coverage, however, it is delicate and on the first day part of it broke while opening it. It also does not fold back up into a neat design, instead, it looks more like an odd fan."
4,A good help,As a novice with Microsoft project it helped me to navigate and create a project to move a process and machinery from Ireland to the US. Would recommend to those who are new to the process.
3,Read the Help,Most of the material is straight from the online help. Download for free and read the Online books associated with installing and administering Project Server 2003 before you spend any $ on a book.
1,WHERE'S THE ACCOMPANYING CD????,"Beware, the book may be good, I just start reading it, but I can't look at the examples from the ""accompanying cd"" because Amazon hasn't made it available to me. I've written them 3 times and still no answer. Buy this book from the bookstore. Also, this ebook is very restrictive. I don't know if I can view it from other computers and it only allows me to copy 10 selections in 7 days, after that no more cutting and pasting.....beware of the limitations. I give this 1 star, not for content but for delivery and restrictions. spearsjunk@hotmail.com"
2,size is not correctly labeled,"I usually wear size 7M. However, This shoe of size 7M is way too small. I have to return it to AMAZON and pay the shipping fee for the return by myself. I will advise anyone who is interested in this shoe to by 1 size larger than the normal size you wear."
5,Love Them Shoes!!!,"I love my Vaneli Shoes. I have gotten so many compliments on them. Besides being very stylish, they are ""way"" comfortable!!"
3,Fun if your child likes circus music.,"My son got this for his 1st birthday. He has trouble getting the animals out of the truck because the handle is too low, however he just throws them once he gets them out so being hard to get to isn't too bad of a thing. He does drive the truck around by the handle for a few seconds, but what really keeps his interest is the circus tune that plays when you press the button. It also plays an elephant and lion sound, which scares him. He will stop and dance EVERY time he hears the curcus tune, so for that bit of distraction I give it 2 stars."
2,BOOO!!!,It's a compilation album. Only like 3 songs from Flict themselves. Wildstyle did the producing so it has his usual flava on the beats but most of them sound like they were done on a Casio keyboard in his basement. The best song on the album isn't even Flict's its The Fakalty's... If Flict gets on a big label and puts out their own album I'll still buy it in a sec. But paying [money]for this album (only 3 songs worth listening too) was a waste. Let 2 of my homeboys who are hardcore Flict fans check it out and they both thought it was garabage. Save your money for the day they put out their own album (which according to the inside of the CD case was suppose to be the fall of 2001).
4,"What it iz , Bucckwild !!!","Crucial Conflict aka The Flict them Wild Boyz from the West Side of da Chi are bacc with they're own record label ""Buccwild Records"".They have a 29 members at Bucckwild Records including The flict.Wildstyle of The Flict produced most of this album.The one thing about this is album is the beat sounds the same in every track ""almost"".Watch out for The Flict's next album ""Illegal"".My favorite tracks on this album are 2,5 & 10.Heres the track titles below ,1. The Land of Bucckwild2. Inside the middle3. How u Raised4. Representin'5. Till Death6. I wanna dance7. Buccwild Anthem8. All my cats9. 102.bucckmuzic10. On and poppin11. Live ya Life12. Gade Life13. Rotate14. Bring it on15. Meditation16. Baby girl17. B.B.S.18. That be me19. Freaks get bucck20. Doe doe21. The call of the wild"
4,Nice Wok,"This is not the wok I ordered. I received an email from The Wok Shop after placing my order for a different wok, informing me it was out of stock and this one would be sent as replacement. It's a good wok. We seasoned it the salt method, it turned black and developed the nonstick finish. Haven't had the chance to use it much, but we like it."
5,stop bothering me,"I was very satisfied with the product but amazon wont leave me alone about writing a review!I didn't want to the first three times you asked, why would I want to the next three times? no one is paying me for my obviously valued opinion. If I want to review a product I will volunteer, otherwise pay me."
4,A good investment for the Arizona bound,"Very worthwhile. I moved to Prescott, Arizona, from the East Coast several weeks ago, and I found this little book to be helpful. It has information about all all sorts of practical things, such as registering your car. If you plan to move to Arizona, I recommend making the small investment for the book. Compared to what the move is going to cost you, the book is virtually free, and you will be glad to have it."
2,Disappointing and Limited Information,"I hate to say it. This book provides very basic information that lacks depth and the insider viewpoint I expected. The limited info that did scratch slightly deeper than the surface centered on the cities of Phoenix and Tucson. Other cities such as Flagstaff, Sedona and Winslow were barely mentioned. I found this book of little real value to someone serious about Moving to Arizona."
4,Great product,"These are awesome cooling racks. They are a little small, but perfect for cooling bread, round cake pans, and like sized items. If you want something for cookies, or a larger pan, I would suggest a different item, as they do not 'play well with each other', that is they do not fit together at all."
3,"Fine for the price, but not outstanding...","The cooling racks work pretty well overall. The wires are a little thin, and the spaces between the wires are large enough for some cookies to fall between the cracks. Placing them on the rack with a spatula, I had some cookies fall ""to their deaths,"" so be sure to place the rack on a clean table so you can rescue any that miss the rack. Works fine for cooling though, once you get the cookies on the rack."
5,YAY!,I have been looking for cooling racks everywhere and cant find them. But when I do they want 10 bucks a piece for them! These were a great deal and have saved my table and counters!
1,cheap,very flimsy. only good things are that they were incredibly inexpensive and do not take up space if you have a small kitchen.
4,Thought provoking and illuminating,"As one of those rare individuals who has had both an NDE AND a Project Bluebook confirmed UFO sighting (with associated ""memory"" of abduction), I found Ken Ring's hypothesis much more plausible than the alternative. I found his explanation on the communication occuring between the Mind at Large and the world's sensitive-intuitive population to be both accurate and liberating."
5,"near death expeariences,alien abductions:a trip to the mind",An excelent book. The author writes an excelent study on the human phsychosis after abductions or near death expeariences.
5,Book was in excellent condition,Ordered the book and received it promptly. Great service from Amazon.
3,Dummies pick something else in this case,"Got some ""dummies"", but this is not the best one. The contents of the supplied CD-ROM is hardly useful for beginners. Project 2003 Step by Step is imo a better book with good digital samples and a digital version of the book on the CD-ROM."
4,A Good Start,"This manuel was an excellent start for some of us ""dummies"" out there. Though I have signed up for a Project Class to be taken in person, this book as definately helped me to get by with a little help from the Dummy Writers."
1,too simple to be useful,I did not like the book because it is assumed that you are dummy even after you finish the book! It does not have enough material and comparatively not a good book. I also bought MSP Step-by-Step and it was much better.
4,Project 2003 - Not For Dummies!,Earlier this year I purchased Project 2003 for Dummies and I must say that it has been a very useful tool. Since purchasing the book from Amazon I have been able to build and use Microsoft Project 2003 for a number of incentive and loyalty marketing projects that I have either launched or worked on. I would highly recommend Project 2003 for Dummies to anyone who needs to build or manage a project plan.
2,Inflates???,"I've had this out of the box for a grand total of 10 minutes, but I am not impressed. I was just about to buy another one here on Amazon but then realized I should check this out first. Boy, am I glad I did! There are no instructions beyond the ""Automatically inflates in 10 seconds"" on the box, but when I opened the valve, I saw almost no difference whatsoever in the thickness of this pad. I kept opening the valve further and further, checking again and again for more instructions in case there was another step, but to no avail. It is maybe 3/4"" thick except in the little circles where the front adheres to the back, and apparently, this is as cushy as it gets? I guess it will be ok for our type of summer camping, but we will still have to be sure the kids are on flat smooth ground. This isn't enough to make up for any branches under the tent, that's for sure. I won't be buying another as it is no different than the 1/2"" or 3/4"" foam pads you can buy for $6.99."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,This mat does not inflate!!! You may as well buy the material to lay on as it does not self inflate in seconds as advertised. I'll be retruning this and getting another brand!!
1,Unhappy with product,"When I purchased this I was not expecting a very cushy air mattress, but I was expecting more than I got with this sleeping pad. I bought it for camping because I have a bad back and need a bit more than the ground. I agree with other reviews that it does not inflate ""in seconds"", or much at all, as it claims to on the box. We waited quite a while before testing it out and realizing that it felt no better than our floor, which means it won't be any better than the ground when camping. I will be returning this and getting another one. I feel as though a Yoga mat would give me more cushion."
3,not for an adult,"We ordered 2 of these for camping trip with cub scouts, and there is no way my husband can sleep on this. It only inflates to about 3/4 - 1 inch and is like you are sleeping on the hard ground. For kids they do not care so it is great. But not made for adults..."
2,charged twice for delivery,the product is good but i was charged twice for delivery (of 2 mats) coming from the same supplier at the same time.
1,Terrible buy,I agree with what the others have said. It does NOT inflate. It is not comfortable. Buying this was a mistake. I'll be returning it tomorrow!
1,Self-Inflating???,If I could give this zero stars I would. It came with no instuctions which would be fine if it inflated. It has been out of the box for 10 minutes and looks no different! I am glad we tested it out before our trip. Will be returning this product. Don't waste your money!
2,Difficult to hold one's attention,Honor and Violence in the Old South- Difficult to get into with much technical and social jargon relative to the historical facts seeking ...
4,good case,I use it while backpacking and strap it to the shoulder straps of my backpack. It sits well and doesn't bounce. Just the right size with adequate compartments.
5,Finally a case that fits!,"It was really hard to find a case that would fit my telephoto lens, but this case was just perfect for it! I liked the extra pouch and the case, in general, feels sturdy."
5,Tamrac 517 SLR Camera Bag,"The Tamrac 517 is the best SLR camera bag I've seen. It will accommodate your SLR with a mounted 5-inch zoom lens, plus your extra batteries and memory cards. It accommodates my Canon 40D and 75-300 zoom lens perfectly. The bag is rugged and durable."
4,excellent case,Holds my camera with 300mm zoom and Lens hood safely and securely. A small investment to keep your camera safe and accessible in the back country.
5,My favorite homeschooling mom devotional,"This is by far my favorite homeschooling mom devotional. I really appreciate the author's vulnerability and honesty, even from the first page. I am new to this homeschooling stuff, and I need all the encouragement I can get. Between this devotional and thatmom.com's podcasts, I feel like I've got the little booster shots I need to get through day after day."
5,Marvelous Collection,"An amazing collection of early western themed films,great quality with written booklet giving backgrounds to each film..Highlight for me is MANTRAP with Clara Bow unavailable anywhere else ,,A credit to the National Film Preservation for their work in restoring and presenting these works..."
1,Never got it,"Bought this for my daughters 15th birthday, never arrived eventhough I bought it a month before her actual birthday. Very disappointed!"
2,SLOW DELIVERY,"I have to say when I ordered this item for a christmas present for someone on Nov 16 I thought hey I'm ahead of the curve... Not So. An item that was in stock took until THE week before christmas to ship and didn't arrive until two days after everyone had left - including the recipient! Lucky I had forethought to order other items for this person, but come on - a 100 piece plastic cookie cutter set that was in stock couldn't make it to the tree when it was ordered more than a MONTH IN ADVANCE. Amazon falling flat on it's face! THis was not an Item that was ordered second had either. I'm severely dissapointed in Amazon this time!"
2,Cookie Nutters For You!,"This set of cookie cutters comes in a handy black office style case which is convenient if you want to take it all to a senile Grandmas' house to bake cookies or shape mud. Many fun designs include pigs, body parts, birds, Halloween shapes and others. Made of Plastic aluminum and does not rust. A worthy addition to any kitchen or madman's house."
1,the majority of the shapes don't work,"This set has too much detail. Even with cold dough, the thin horse's tail always fall's off, the top of the 'A' doesn't come out. The dough sticks to the cookie cutters, even if you grease them. Still for the 20 or so that work well, i.e. the truck, the pumpkin, the tree; it's still a decent value. We just moved most of them from the kitchen to the play-do drawer. I was looking forward to having an annual supply of great cookies--a disappointment for sure."
5,LOVE IT!,"I can't think of another cookie cutter I need. This set contains every conceivable shape you could think of and more.Not every cutter is appropriate for cutting cookie dough, playdoh, or sandwich bread. You'll have to be discriminating because some cutters have way too much detail, or thin appendages, etc.But there are enough of a variety that you'll find a few you can use for just about any project."
5,Two year olds love them!,"I purchased this product so that two to three year old kids can use them when they play with Play-Doh. Supervised, these cutters are safe and do not harm the kids. The best part: they love them!"
1,I'll let you know when I get them,"I know when I ordered I had read the review that gives the sizes range of the cutters and the list of what is included, but I never noticed the comments about the delay in delivery. Here I am looking at almost 90 days and still waiting for my shipment.Will our little ones still be young enough to enjoy the crafts and the cookies?"
2,not so great!!,"i much rather prefer fewer pieces but made of metal instead....these cutters come in a great assortment, but are only good for making cold dishes, since you cannot use them for anything too hot or harder consistency.....most of them my daughter uses for playing with playdough!"
3,Good for light use or to play with!,"Let's face it, these cookie cutters are best used for cooking with kids, or letting them play with them. They do have many different basic shapes and will carry you through all of the holidays. They are good for playing with clay, or making cookies if you are not too finicky. These cutters do not always release well, and you do need to baby them along a bit if you want perfect results. In my opinion if you were looking for the perfect cookie cutter you wouldn't be buying a package of a 100 of them for such a low price. I think they are great for everyday. Be patient, or give them to the kids to play with. They are lot of fun"
2,Wish I'd gone with Wilton's 100-piece set!,"Here's the deal -- I'm a sucker for the free shipping option. So I went with these cookie cutters (which cost less and had free shipping) instead of my gut -- I had borrowed the Wilton cookie cutters from someone else, but I figured: How different can they be? Here's how:1. The Wilton cookie cutters are larger in scale, so for little hands, it makes them easier to use and larger cookies for easier decorating.2. One-third (I counted) of the non-letter Rosco cutters have those insets other folks have mentioned, making them useless for making cookies (because you'd have to literally dig out the cookie dough from those parts). I kept them for my little girl, in case they'll work with her play clay ... but it sure makes them pointless for cookies.3. Unlike the other reviewers, my Rosco cutters arrived promptly. But again, I wished I'd spent a bit more on the Wilton cutters.Have fun using your cutters, whichever you choose!"
2,Big ones,"The cookie cutters are good... that is if you like to make cookies the ""american"" size!! Boy! They are BIG, so not only the cookies are going to be huge but you need a lot of space to store the whole collection. As for the shapes I was dissapointed with the selection, it is not that great. I love the complete alphabet though."
4,emdog,"Bob Hillman...well, I'd have to agree with Maggie-at-Bran. Bob is an amazing talent, and this really shows in a live performance. I've been fortunate enough to see him twice, and have been extremely impressed both times. His CD is great as well, and I hear he's coming out with a new one soon. Bob Hillman is an awesome performer(how am I doing with the adjectives?). Plus, he's hot."
4,bob hillman: musician,"bob hillman displays a unique talent of writing a beautiful song, but being sarcastic at the same time. a great songwriter and a great live performer, bob captures what being a musical artist is all about. way to go bob. check out everyone's an actor and spitting nails. playing god too."
4,Clever songwriting with historical and religious themes,"Playing God is a colorful, intriguing collection of songs with references to history, culture, and religion that help to bring topics to life. ""Little Things"" is ironic, suggesting that, unlike a Roman emperor or an obnoxious celebrity, he wishes for love and inspiration, not money or power. ""Spitting Nails,"" ""I Turn Slowly Around,"" and ""When I Wrote the Book"" express bitterness in upbeat, very clever ways. ""Everyone's an Actor..."" seems to poke fun at the artistic community while showing sympathy for artists and writers in their financial struggles. ""Salem"" is a serious example of Hillman's apparent appreciation of history; in this case, the darker side. One line in particular could sum up the problem with much of our society, including so much simple-minded pop music on mainstream radio: ""There's no use diving for pearls in the shallow part of the world."""
1,Trite Folk/Rock with flat melodies,"I was hoping that this would be a collection of good folk/pop songs. Extremely disappointing. The songs are very self-conscious, and show no creativity- they all sound like a Freedy Johnston wannabe but don't ever make the grade. Snooooooz. Don't bother"
3,Steve Reeves or Gordon Scott?,"Poor audio and faded colors; overall passable. Whose picture appears on front box, to the left of Alan Ladd's? It's not Steve Reeves'; rather it's Gordon Scott's."
3,Quality Poor but worth the price if your after The White Warrior,"-I bought this movie for ""The White Warrior"" starring Steve Reeves and that is basically all I got. White Warrior was a bit grainy but very watchable. Not a bad movie all around if your a Steeve Reeves fan.-Duel of Champions which I own on another disc is unwatchable on this one. The picture shakes so much throughout that I feel it should have a siezure warning attached. At one point in Duel of Champions the sound actually goes off for about 15 min."
4,Comprehensive and quite complete guide to Bay area,"If you've checked your local bookstore recently, you know that books on San Francisco are proliferate and sometimes too similar to distinguish one from another. THis book, however, is a terrific addition to any Bay ARea lover's bookshelf. The more than 400 pages are organized by activity/venue and include the inside scoop on local places to shop, eat, visit and partake of, as well as well-known sites and stops. INcluded are lists of weekend jaunts (with lodging, restaurant and shopping information), all levels of dining, from downhome to upscale gourmet, and TOp 25 lists to direct those with limited time to explore. The star rating scale seems to be fair, from the perspective of a frequent San Francisco traveler. Only drawback is that superlatives are peppered throughout the reviews and can be misleading if you don't read carefully.A nice addition to MY already-burgeoning bookshelf!"
4,Great Book,"This book is a great read. It gives an in depth history of Time, the Warner, then AOL. Then it goes through how they became one, and what happened after the merger. The only thing that I found is that there are so many people that were apart of the merger and the history that towards the end you start having to go back and figure out who this person was, or who that person what. There were over 50 people who it gives the history of. I did find it a lot easier to sort them out on the second read. But over all I would say for someone who would like to know what happened this is a great start."
3,Overpriced and overhyped,"This is an article masquerading as a book. When the price drops to the price of a newsstand magazine, as the towering remainder pile suggests it will any day now, pick up a copy. Until then, read the Vanity Fair excerpt."
2,Dry as a desert,Not at all readable or even very interesting. There are far superior works regarding pre-Civil War Freemen's Colonies in Ontario.
4,A wealth of useful information; not always easily readable.,"This book has a huge amount of useful information for the racing sailor - tips, tactics, strategies, execution, etc. It does assume some prior knowledge, which I didn't always have when I read it, and it is not always as clear or readable as it could be - some sections, I had to read 3 or 4 times before I understood them. It's a great book, though, and does concentrate on tactics, as the title suggests. There are also tips on boatspeed, sail trim, crew psychology, etc. It's intelligently broken down into sections - pre-start, starting tactics, the reach, the run, finishing, etc. I highly recommend it - just be prepared to work at it a little bit, once in a while."
2,Not much content for the money.,"This CD is a bit short of a new media experience; the content and file size is limited and low res.; I had hoped it would permit more detailed viewing than the equivalent material in book form. I also bought the Hadid CD which was several years newer, slightly better presentation and more content. Still neither gave the satisfaction of flipping pages at the coffee table or on the thrown."
4,A loving story of a family and their grief,"Caty was Catherine Morgan, diagnosed with bone cancer and given improper treatment because her parents, who were amicably divorced, were understandably reluctant to see her lose her arm, and this decision may in the end have cost her her life in 1980 at age 12.Her mother, the author, feels enormous guilt about this, and the holistic doctor she initially saw later lost his license and went to prison.Even if Caty hadn't become ill, it would have been a wonderful story. Her mother is a good writer and I wonder if she ever published anything else. Caty was adopted into a family with several teenagers and an unstable marriage (the implication is strong that it was an effort to save the marriage) and the photos indicate she had visited many countries, without much explanation.I wonder if Ms. Morgan, who would now be in her 80s, is still living and if so, how she is doing."
4,Hail to McCarthy,A compulsive read and an ideal gift for your Irish friends living abroad. At times I found myself laughing out loud..........a real tonic.
4,Good review of a complex and controversial subject.,Good layman's level overview of the technical problems with critical control via software and a discusssion of how industry and individual experts are trying to deal with the problem
1,"Old idea, and bad plot .....","The author came with an old idea, revenge and seduction, it's ok. But then she also failed to come up with new scenes and plot to make the story more interesting.It's not so boring in the first chapter, but then the plot became so dull that I just missed some chapters, put it down, and went to sleep.To conclude, SAVE YOUR TIME & MONEY. But if you're interested in collecting one, just buy the second-hand one."
3,Great for around the house.,"It worked great when I threw out my back. I could sit at my computer much longer with the brace on. Walking was easier too. As far as ""comfort and fit to support your ACTIVE life"" well, It really depends on your idea of active life. The brace works wonders supporting your back but it shifts up and out of place when you twist or move out of an upright position. It became more cumbersome than helpful while running errands and trips to the mall. But if the brace were more flexible or had elastic sides for more mobility then it would probably lose it's great support.I would recommend this for moderate to intense pain. Great for the home or office. But I would get a more flexible support for more active activities."
1,Did Not Work Well,"The problem with this brace is that it moves every time you move. It's particularly troublesome after you've been sitting when it adjusts itself based on the chair you're using. When you stand up it turns sideways and offer no support. Well honestly, even when it's in place it offers no support. The price is right but it's useless. I would not recomment this product."
3,Fitment,"Hi. The belt is becoming loose. Even though the 'Large' size was correct and fits my physique, it is becoming loose."
3,waist belt Futuro,In general its a good belt and the price is reasonable. I just don't like the open and close feature. The open-closed feature of the belt make it not fully supported my back. It turns out to be good after my elaborate sewing.
4,A back support that does not cost you a lot.,"I have always had a back problem, so as many millions Americans. This belt does what it is supposed to do, especially that you tight it as hard or as soft as you want."
4,good product,"i hurt my back lifting some stuff i shouldn't have been lifting. i used this product for a few days and it really helped - good support. oh and it didn't take forever to arrive, and the price was cheaper than CVS."
3,"Good support, difficult to use","I like the support this brace gives my back, but I have others that are much easier to put on."
2,Back support,This product is probably ok for an average person but is not large enough for a 52 inch waist.
4,Lower Back Sacro Brace,I had an injured tail bone and was having trouble sitting and getting up and down (had terrible pain) and this Sacro Brace really help. I would highly recommend this product.
2,disappointed MOM!,I was disappointed with the quality of this item. Little tike is a name I have learned to trust and this was a bummer. The front broke because of it's poor design and flimsy plastic parts. So now it is just a broken dump truck. Also you have to push the button for the sounds to work. It is not motion sensitive.
3,Front blade is useless,"The front blade falls off every few seconds it seems. We bought nearly a dozen of these for some kids, and all the trucks had the same issue. However, even without the blade, it is still a dump truck and kids still played with it just fine."
4,Famous collection for guitar improvisation,"A selection of great jazz tracks for improvisation with a guitar or a other instrument (for exemple wind instrument). Good orchestra. Differents scales, tempo and styles of jazz."
1,Boomerang-a fantasy odyssey,"The book doesn't even deserve one star!This book MIGHT be fine for children but adults are more realistic. I am serious, this book was so far out from reality it was hard to concentrate on reading it. THUMBS DOWN!"
3,"Sweet book, more for a child",Very nice book about a sweet little dog that lives a short life and then comes back for another. Very positive story.
4,Excellent source for creative forms.,"I love this book for it's creative ideas. I especially enjoyed folding the eagle, its three dimensional result is a joy to view. There is a bit of cutting on some forms (which I don't like), but the variety of forms and the creative layouts more than make up of this...."
4,Interesting,"These are probably his best published interviews but they could be better edited so there would not be so much repetiton among them. It is interesting that in the 1980s Vidal is concerned with being new and fresh interesting by being ""interested"" but his work starts largely repeating itself about this time, long before this should be happening due to aging. Did the heavy alcohol consumption eventually get to him? Epstein Barr?"
3,Point out the obvious,"Just to make certain no one makes the bonehead mistake I did, this adapter only works with Pioneer radios. I found this looking for the same type of adapter for my factory Chrysler radio, but just because the website says it can fit your car doesn't mean it has a Pioneer radio."
5,Excellent way to connect RCA outputs...,I purchased this item in order to daisy chain a Soundgate Zune Integration Kit (SoundGate ZNCBLPAK) into my Pioneer HD Radio module. It worked perfectly and is seen by the head unit as Auxiliary 2. Sound quality is fantastic.It will allow you to connect any device with Right and Left RCA outputs into the IP-Bus and will be seen as an auxilliary device. This device is referred to as a 'CD Adapter' but be aware that if you add a Pioneer CD changer to your system you must use the CD-RB20 in order for it to work properly. It should be instead labeled as 'RCA Input Adapter' for better accuracy which is what Pioneer lists it as.This particular adapter has to be at the very end of any daisy chain since it has no IP-Bus pass through.
5,Great Product & Price!,This was a great item to purchase. It was exactly what i was looking for. And i could pass up the price. Great seller! Would def purchase again.
5,Very informative and useful.,"Found this to be a very useful book. We have five cats, and one with behavioral problems."
5,godfather of documentaries,"must watch if your a fan or even if you never watched one of his moviesits a very fun imformative and entertaining. from the early days to the beginning of the gore and on its all told by the godfather of gore himself hg lewis, along with long time partner david friedman, john waters and joe bob briggs and so many actors including mel arnold give testimony to this directors work."
3,Not What I Expected,"Somehow I expected this book would present a new perspective on the historical roots of the early Christian church. It has nothing to do with history. Rather it is one Jewish man's search to understand the spirituality behind Catholic and Orthodox Chistianity without becoming a convert. Now that, per se, is not a bad premise for a book. Where this one goes astray is that it flails and flounders in tedious endless talk which goes nowhere, tells us nothing, and makes little sense to anyone who doesn't live in a cloistered cell. Reading this book is like beating the wind with a paddle, much effort expended for very little pay-off."
2,Boring and Difficult to Comprehend,"PROS:Really interesting topicA few good thought-provoking questions (but sadly no real answers to these questions)CONS:-Boring bio of a self-professed non-Christian's life and and thoughts on Christianity-Many pointless and boring encounters with ""wise"" religious men he has met.-Almost the entire book is about the previous two points above-After taking you through pages of detail, building up an encounter with some religious figure, the author confesses ""he can't remember what happened"" or what he learned from the guy. This happens several times in this book-The author rambles and rambles... this book should be about 1/4 of the size-Average reader will NOT be able to get through even the first chapter. Think 3 times as difficult as the King James Bible. Think serious Christian philosophy.-The author also uses a DIFFICULT to follow writing style with complex, run-on sentences."
4,"Warm and intelligent. Great intro to the ""Royal Way"".","St. Benedict is to have said: ""Always, we begin again"". The older I get, the more I know this to be true..especially in light of the urgency I feel for that Truth within Christianity that I know to exist- but how often it eludes me! Prof. Needleman lead me through his own search for possibility. ""Occult Christianity"", ""New Religions"", the emptiness of philosophy without a change of Heart,..read and know you DON'T have to look to an Eastern religion for that Kingdom of Heaven within. (I also recommend Robin Amis' ""A Different Christianity"")"
2,"A different take on the Lazuras tale, but leaves the reader empty.","Alain Absire's ""Lazarus"" takes us through what happened just before and the years after the great miracle where Jesus brought Lazarus back from the dead. The miracle only half restored Lazarus, and indeed, he is stuck in a sort of purgetory, neither fully alive or dead, where he cannot be killed and feels no hunger, but suffers greatly. Lazarus befriends another recipent of Jesus's miracles, and he tries to find out why the miracle happened, and how can it be fully relized. The novel ends(or more aptly) goes to black in A.D 70, as Jerusalem is sacked and many Jews die."
3,Good all around remote,"We bought this awhile ago and it is still working. It is called a ""big button"" remote...not that big. If you have poor eye sight...not your best choice. But for all around remote..good choice."
4,Excellent Value will change your ways!,"This is one outstanding piece of kitchenware you do not want to be without. If you have never roasted with a rack and pan, the results will amaze you. The bottom of the meat does is not stuck in a pool of juices, so true roasting happens here. Making pan gravy is a snap but strained au juis is a treat, too. My daughter loves to cook and we thought we would try this. Now my spouse will never insist on low-end cookware again! You should buy the very best you can afford, and it will last. If you are on a budget, THIS is the one to start your collection with. Handwashing is easy and minimal care to avoid scratching is advised. I will never ever argue with my spouse over foil roasting pans or dutch ovens for turkey again! The war of cookware is over, thanks to the Roscho Non Stick Pan and V-Rack!"
2,Roshco Non-Stick Roasting Pan with V Rack,"This product was purchased approxmately eight months ago and used six times. Unfortunately, when we went to use it again we noticed that the teflon was peeling in the center of the pan. We soak and clean all our pans with hot soapy water after each use and have not had any problems with other teflon products.We took the pan back to Khohl's where we purchased it and they told us to contact the manufacture, since they no longer carry this product. We have purchased your products before and have been very satisfied.I writing to report this teflon problem so that it may help to correct it . We enjoy using teflon products and do not want to resort to stainlees steel."
5,FANTASTIC BUY,"THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE BUY. I HAVEN'T USED IT YET BUT I CAN TELL YOU IT IS WORTH AT LEAST $150. IT'S REALLY, REALLY NICE. IT'S A STEAL!"
2,Non-stick coating doesn't stand up to heavy use,"I bought this pan about 2 years ago and have only used it a few times, mostly at Thanksgiving. The pan has always been difficult to clean. Food sticks to the non-stick coating. I usually cook the turkeys in my Weber grill and I'm cooking two turkeys this year. Today, the day before Thanksgiving, I cooked the first of this years turkeys. When I was cleaning the pan a section of the non-stick surface about the size of a penny came off. I noticed there were several other smaller areas where it was coming off. I'm going to have to discard the pan now. I realize that in using the pan in a barbecue grill I may be subjecting it to temperatures that are higher than recommended for non-stick pans but judging by the heavy construction I assumed this pan would perform better. My next roasting pan will be stainless with no coating."
2,cleaning,"I use my roasting pan very carefully. When I am done using it, I soak it before cleaning it so I won't have to scrub it. I clean it with just soap and water and my dish cloth. I am finding that there are marks left on it and I don't dare to try and clean it because it looks like the non-stick ware is coming off."
3,Simply too general and unfocused,"This books definitely have good stuff in it, but you become frustrated because you have to dig so much. The books cover way too many issues that are non-specific to serious games. In the places where it do deal with serious games it on, however, quite successful but without being brilliant."
2,handle should be higher so little hand can play with it,"My son had trouble getting the cow and the horse in and out of the stall and then the whole stall isn't secured onto the truck so,when he pushes it the pieces slide around. I think it is a good concept, but the handle should be higher so that little hands can reach in and put the pieces on and off the truck without help from mommy or daddy. We use it without the pieces and my son just takes that truck and runs all over the place, like I said it is a good concept to put a handle on atruck. It makes it easier for children 1 or 2 and is more fun for them. We just keep the pieces in his toy box and off of the truck and he can play with them with his ""little people barn set""."
2,Better trucks out there.,"This toy is frustrating to my 1 yr old son and his friends for two reasons: the first is that when he pushes on the back of the handle, the front comes up and pops him in the mouth (since he is crawling very near or directly above the truck). The second frustration is that the handle makes it hard to actually get anything in or out of the back of the truck, since he has pudgy little hands. Blocks fit into the hole in the end, but it's harder to get them out. I would recommend the Hasbro squishy trucks instead for littler toddlers. Softer and safer!"
5,health,Great book I thought. I wanted information on how to eat better. I thought the information was great for my background in nutrition.
2,Terribly Advertised,"I read that this book was paperback so I ordered it. What I didn't realize was that it was a 1/4 of the size of the actual full size book, and did not contain all the information I needed. It was almost a quick reference."
2,Oops!,I bought the UK version by mistake. I'll have to buy the US version so that I can understand all the stuff that is in it. Oops!Charles
2,"Dated, with some incaccurate and dangerous comments/advice","I usually like the ""For Dummies"" series. But this one is disappointing. I don't like the ""cutesy"" writing style, but mostly, lots of info is dated and inaccurate. At a later date I will try to go through it with specific examples, but for now I can mention she is wrong about things like: What type of fish is safe, what type of cookware is safe, etc... Another page cheerily claims that GMOs are ""used to make foods more nutritious, better tasting, (and) more resistant to disease and insects"". Yeah, right. And not even a full page about organic food, with extremely dated info. I just skimmed through it, but found enough to wish I hadn't purchased it, now I have to question everything I read, based upon the many inaccuracies I found while flipping through it."
1,Too Little,"Maybe I didn't read the blurb carefully enough, but I expected a full-size volume when I ordered this book. What I got was a very small, pocket-sized book with minimal detail. I also expected a concise explanation of nutrition needs. I was not pleased with the book."
5,Excellent!,"Perfect for people who don't know the first thing about nutrition (my husband) and for people just wanting to brush up on their nutrition knowledge (me). I love ""For Dummies"" books!"
3,Information overload,"I'm sure this is a very good book, but it was just a bit too much for a busy person like myself, who just wanted to get the bare essentials about how to eat healthy. I just wanted to know the basic information about carbs, protein, etc., and be given an exact list of what to eat, in what specific quantities and why. Instead, I found myself plodding wearily through page after page of heavily detailed information about calories, vitamins, food allergies, government RDAs and other such fascinating subjects, which is fine if you're studying to be the kind of single-minded health fanatic whom other people avoid at parties. Thank goodness for the cartoons! They should market a 60 or 70 page abridged version of this book entited, ""Nutrition for Dummies: Just take my word for it- I have a degree!"". Or perhaps ""Nutrition for Dummies: Less red meat, more fruits and vegetables""."
2,not what i wanted,I checked out this book as much as i could on-line before buying and it sounded like a great way to figure out what i was doing wrong with my dieting and nutrition. all it did was point out the same old tired information that appears in all the other books and waste several pages explaining how the digestive system works. i was hoping for a book that would use the ideas of good nutrition to put together menus but this one didn't come through. i wish i hadn't bought it.
1,maybe accurate in 1950,"This book contains a lot of information that seems so dated. The author seems like she's pretty out of touch with modern nutritional knowledge. What this book taught me: Food processing makes food safe and yummy. The US RDA is a respected guideline. Antibotics and hormones make livestock healthy and efficient. Wake up lady.If you are looking for up-to-date health information on topics such as: natural vitamins vs. synthetic vitamins, the nutritional value of bleached flour, micronutrients, carcinogens, or food additives, don't bother with this book. It is like a text book from the 1950s, written with a cutesy style that grates on you when you realize how inaccurate the information is."
2,did not work for me,I got this and went out and pulled my old one off and tried to fit this one up to where I took the old one out and it would have cost me as much as if I had it installed by the dealer to get all the adapters I would have needed
5,Best Kids Book Ever!,Monster Cheese is a really fun book. I read it to my young cousins at a family party and they were hooked! The character of Sam reminded me of someone I know. :-)I realize this book is hard to find but well worth the search!Kudos to Steve Wolfson for writing such an interesting story!
3,Shrink easy,"I bought a few packages of these and some of them maintained their size when I washed them, while others shrunk by at least 3 inches. My husband is 6'1"" and needs them to be longer so it can be a waste to buy these when some of them work and the rest get thrown out or donated."
4,Good shirts,I needed some extra a-shirts and these where exactly what I wanted. And at a good price! They were shipped in a reasonable time too.
4,Value Plus,"Internet shopping has really changed the world. So many Australian companies have shut down production and moved it to China, bringing back these items at no savings to reflect the cheaper labor involved. This is my protest and I am pleasantly surprised at the price and quality of these Hanes singlets, AND, they AIN'T MADE IN CHINA!!! Even with the postage to Australia I have scored a bargainHanes Classics Men's Classics 6-Pack A-Shirt Value Pack"
3,"Not sure, but I think these was a package of one offs.","They are standing up pretty well, and are what they are. However, I don't think any of the 6 are the same size. I have two that come down to my thighs, two that about two inches shorter, and 2 that don't stay tucked in at with an average day at work."
3,I've had better,"Is it just me or have they gotten cheaper in quality over the years. Are they thinner? Flimsier? That's the impression I get. Thanks for nothing, China!"
4,Paris is invaded!,The MASH Goes To series continues with the virtual destruction of the City of Lights!
1,What a waste of time!,"This book was painfully boring. It seemed like the same story over and over again in each chapter. I could only read half the book before I came to my senses and wondered why I was wasting my time. If you are faced with the choice of reading this book or watching grass grow, choose the grass!"
2,Disappointing,"Thought the title was fabulous, and had high expectations for the book. In places it was good, especially some of the phrases she used, but I found it very repetitive and not funny. Holly's overwhelming maternal joy was also not in keeping with the rest of the book, maybe she could have felt maternal joy but not written about it."
