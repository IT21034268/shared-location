5,Review of Daily Poetry,"What an incredible collection of poems with ideas for use in any classroom across the United States. Students in all regions would enjoy the poetry included in this collection. I particularly enjoyed the ideas which included vocabulary, word families, and writing connections which accompanied each and every poem! My favorite poem has to be Hallowe'en Parade by Sonja Dunn. The other poetry choices and list of books about Halloween will keep any group of students engaged for weeks with print! I would recommend, no, require this book of all teacher candidates!"
3,could be deeper,I have yet to find a poetry book that digs deeply into the form and messgae of the poems. Although I really like the enrichment activities in this book I feel that the poems are more geared for kinder or 1st grade. I have had to make my own questions for each poem and I only use these for my low readers. They love them and really like to do the activities that go along with them...especially when they can do them independently!
5,Great,"what can I say it fit , it made the radio installation very easy . It was long enough to reach and give you the space thats needed to install the radio ."
3,Not as good as the Inner Game of Tennis,"The content of this book turns itself to addressing the application of the ideas expressed in ""The Inner Game of Tennis"" by the same author. The first book is excellent - the best bit about it is that the basic idea is good and the book doesn't take 400 pages to explain it. The second book has some extensions to the first but not enough to warrant a whole new book. You are left with the idea that the author is scratching around for material to fill up the number of pages the publisher asked for.IMHO buy the first book for sure. Books are cheap so, if you're looking to implement the ideas, this book will still pay back the investment but skim read it."
3,Hit and Miss,"The songs I do like, the first and last, I like a lot: I bought this DVD because them. A few others were OK to good, but some I found to be actually annoying.I should mention that this is a genre about which I don't know much. Someone else, a gospel music fan, may find this to be a good collection of songs. I don 't know. If one or more of the other reviews say that, in their expert opinion, that this is a good DVD, believe them and ignore me."
2,Depends are not as good as Poise,Depends are not as comfortable as poise. They also don't seem to absorb as much without leaks. Okay for folks that only need minor emergency coverage.
4,Swordfighting lover's must,"These three movies, like The Seven Samurai, are a must-see for anyone who enjoys iai or kendo. Accurate swordfighting, not just sword-swinging in time to the soundtrack!"
1,"Great movie, lousy DVD","The movie is completely wonderful. Unfortunately, the image quality of this DVD is completely unwatchable. Much of the movie is too dark to make out what is happening, day scenes look like night scenes. You are literally better off buying the VHS version of this movie.Unfortunately, the same is true of the other DVDs in this trilogy. I had to return all three."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN MORE REALISTIC,"IT'S NOT LOYAL TO THE BOOK OF FIVE RINGS.IF YOU DIDN'T READ THE BOOK YOU MAY FIND IT BORING.BUT FOR THE OLD TECHNOLOGY IT'S OK TO SEE HISTORY.IF YOU LIKE TOSHIRO MIFUNE,THIS MOVIE IS REASONABLE."
2,a half review,"in the history of filmmaking, i guess it was important.but i actually found it kind of droll"
5,"Read the book, then see the film","It is understandable that people don't quite ""get it"" when they watch Japanese samurai movies. Having lived in Japan for many years, and having watched hundreds of them, along with NHK's long running ""samurai soap opera"". I too confess to being confused at times.However, if you want to understand what this film is about, get a copy of the book ""Musashi"" by Yoshikawa Eiji, one of Japans top novelists (Harper & Row, Publishers/Kodansha International, ISBN 0-06-859851-3). It is the story of Musashi Miyamoto and the film is based on this book. Read it and you will understand more fully the people, places and intricacies of the film. Even though the three-part film is long, it isn't long enough to do justice to the book.Read the book, then watch (or re-watch) the film, you'll be amazed."
5,1/3 of the story,"To a quick shopper like me who read the book and wants to see the video, don't make the same mistake I did and buy only this video. This is about the first 300 of 900 pages and has a rather incomplete ending for someone expecting the whole story. Make sure you buy Samuri II and III if you want to see the whole of Miyamoto Mushashi."
3,Gay Softball Is The Sort of Thing That Gets The Author Intellectually Exercised,"Sounds like this book is a law school study guide. But to show that the author is not only about dry facts, I adduce his recent quite excited reflections on Gay Softball. On the anti-gay site Mirror of Justice, he breathlessly details some court case involving, probably in the author's prejudicial mind, gay guys who like to spend their Saturdays saying ""Hey batter, what a big bat you have!"" And Thomas Berg is so worked-up in anticipation of similar breathless comments from his readers that he especially exhorts the readers to be on their ""best behavior"". He knows the whole subject of Gay Softball brings out the devil in his little cadre. What impressive legal thinkers these people are. No wonder he has such clarity on Church-State issues."
2,The State and Religion in a Nutshell (Nutshell Series),"As a guide on religion and religious freedoms, this book was disappointing in that it did not address neo-pagan religious groups and religious viewpoints in America... especially one of the fastest growing religions in the States: Wicca. In federal court in 1985, Wicca became recognized as an ""official"" religion in the U.S. (See Detmer v. Landon) And in light of the religious freedoms that have been trampled on over the years for non-mainstream religions in schools, prisons, employment, etc., it would have been great to see some of this addressed in this book."
5,Very nice for the money,"Replaced a rattling pair of Boston Acoustics CX4's with these. The bass is not quite as good I have an 8"" Rockford sub, and the bass from these alone would be a bit weak. Higher range response seems fine, but I am no expert. These suit my needs at a very reasonable price."
3,Not really my cup of tea...,"This CD is relaxing. The music is very Chinese based new age sounding. It is performed well and does what it sets out to do--create a calming soundscape. For the most part it's well integrated and easy to listen to. However, I personally dislike whooshy synthesizer music--I very much prefer actual instruments/voices. I find synthesized flutes etc may relax me, but real flutes impart a spiritual depth and complexity of sound that synthesized music doesn't (except Brian Eno's Thursday Morning, but that's another story)."
5,Really comfortable and look great,"I really like these, and of course as i get them, the east coast is slammed with bad weather, but i love when i actually do wear them. However, i recommend some high and tight socks, the opening tends to pull my socks down."
3,Twice Returned??,Have not worn yet! Ordered first pair and they were scratched! Returned & ordered 2nd pair and both boots had white faded spots on the leather! Where is the quality control? Trying once more since the boot looks and fits perfectly. Do not know how they wear yet. Very disappointing to received damaged products.
5,Great quality for the price!,"I needed a boot with a heel that was versatile. The prior version I had was 57 bucks and also a Georgio Brutini but they NEVER broke in. These are a bit higher, a TON softer, and fit better. Comfortable to wear and they look cool with a suit and with jeans. Plus, they were actually priced better than at Zappo's with the same return guarantee. I am ordering a back-up pair. May even get a second color too."
2,Giorgio Brutini Men's Boots 80575,"I have two pairs of G Brutinis boots and this is the third one I purchased. I am rather disappointed because the right boot is noticeably smaller than the left one. I decided to keep them and use wearing thin socks only.... I even wondered if my right foot is larger than the left one but the problem clearly lies with the boots, not my feet.... Since the boots are made in China, perhaps their population has feet that do not match - can't tell as I have never been there....Will I be willing to purchase another pair? I rather doubt...."
3,Good price but cheaply made.,"I really needed half boots to help correct a back problem, and since two inch heels are not the fashion right now, they are hard to find. These Brutini's are stylish looking and they are comfortable, but in only a couple of months, they have started to peel around the toes and sides, which is disappointing."
5,goood boot!,Wonderful product.These boots have a great style and are comfortable! They do get scratched easily but excellent to wear almost everyday.
4,Brutini Men's Boots,Arrived quickly and were as expected. Fit was perfect as well as the craftsmanship. I was very pleased with the product and the price.
3,"Order your normal size, not 1/2 inch larger as suggested","These boots are very feminine, but that is my fault as I was thinking the same thing when I looked at the pictures prior to ordering. I loved the style and thought I could make it work. If the heels were an inch lower, I think I could make these work. I'm now getting ready to return boots I ordered along with the slip on shoes I also ordered. Also, many people suggested to order 1/2 size bigger than what you normally wear, which is what I did, but that is a bad idea as both shoes I ordered were a 1/2 inch to an inch too big!"
4,Bravo!,"With an alto sultry voice and decent technique, Ms. Salena Jones has every element to be a successful singer along the line of the great Ella Fitzgerald. I am suprised that I am the frist to review this CD (if not the first one to review among all her CDs in Amazon). The roar of the chrous in ""Bridge Over Trobuled Water"" and the sigh of ""The Way We Were"", which, IMHO, bests Barbara (no flamebait, Barbara fans), just dazzle me. The only reason not for a 5 stars review is because I hate some of song selection, e.g. Feelings, My Everyday, I Can See Clearly Now. Recommend Songs: ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", ""The Way We Were"", ""My Way""."
2,An early Vance not his best,"A formulaic, pulp SciFi novella. I actually have never finished it...and I love Vance. It seems as if he were just learning his craft at the time he wrote this. In hindsight, one perceives bits of the later master, but that's not enough. Only for the Vance fan who has to have EVERYTHING."
5,quick and accurate service,This battery is difficult to find in local stores. It was great to quickly find it online and receive it in a few days at a reasonable price.
5,WHAT I NEEDED.... GOT WHAT IS IN PICTURE!!!,"Have had, seen others complain and have a fit!! I HOWEVER am not doing that. I'll try to be infomational when needed. HOWEVER I did recieve what I wanted. Other have have not, BUT , I did. this is a SPECIAL battery, which is hard to come by, Have yet to see this size, power rating in ANY retail store. save time a capital and just get them....tanx"
4,Product delivered as specified,This product was delivered as advertised. I had no problems with the supplier. Would recommend you purchase from this source.
5,"5 batteries, fast shipping, good price.",I got five (5) batteries with my order. The shipping was VERY fast. The batteries were the same brand and model as in my auto remote which needed replacing.
3,GP27A Battery fine but not as in original picture presented...,"The seller presented the GP27A battery as in a strip of 5 batteries. The number with the photo also presented a strip of 5 batteries. So based on the photo and model number, I was expecting the strip of 5 batteries. Instead only a single battery was shipped. I think another customer has made this same complaint. I should have taken that review more seriously. But instead went by the photo and number associated with the number ( that indicated the strip package of 5 batteries ).The battery worked fine, but the seller is giving the wrong impression by showing a photo of the product as being a strip package of 5 batteries. Not too cool. A bit disappointed with this."
4,"Great Product, Great Price, Bad packaging",The batteries were great. Fully charged and ready to go. The only problem I had was that the packaging was all open and half the batteries were just lying loose in the envelope upon arrival.
5,Just what I needed,Absolutely perfect. I needed one for my remote starter. There's only one store in my area that sells this size of battery and they're $6 each. This is a much greater value.
2,Sorry cd from a talented rapper....,"Lil Sicko's debut album was a very sorry one at that, he has a couple nice jams including the banger Who's That, but that's as good as this album gets, and is probably the only reason to buy this. His newer cd is alot better, it's actually a great rap cd among the best in Chicano/Latin rap. But this album fails to show us how skilled Sicko really is, the appearances are also very weak. Production is ok, but can be very simple at times, it just doesn't cut it, bad samples, good rapper, bad features with the exception of Wreck. To put it to you in one sentence, stay away from this cd."
1,ITS ALL ABOUT THE BIG I.E FONTANA,DAMM I ONLY HEARD 1 OF HISS SONNGS AND IT WASTIGHTT I WANT 2 HEAR IT AGAIN . ITS CALLEDD WHO'S THATHESSS TIGHTT B CAUSE HES FROM THE BIG ASSS I.E
5,A well-built pickup bed essential,"My bias in selecting accessories for my Honda Ridgeline is that they have to be designed to a similar level of quality as the truck itself. (And no matter what you might think about the Ridgeline itself, there is no dispute that it is a very high-quality vehicle.)This cargo bar reaches that level. Unlike some competing products, the two bar components are solid metal (not a plastic inner bar). The ratchet mechanism is a little fussy to unlock, but allows for fine increments. This makes it a good match for my truck's inner sidewalls, which are fiberglass, as I can lock in the bar without putting too much stress on them. The rubber pads swivel well and make it easy to find an anchoring spot on the grooved sidewalls.I recommend this bar for its good design at a reasonable price."
4,Good product so far.,Just started to us it. Had in truck about three weeks. In the weather all the time. No rust . Haven't put a loof stress on it yet.
4,Very useful,"I like this better than the 'click' type.You just pull this out to engage the sides of the bed, then ratchet it tight (just don't force it too much, or you'll distort the sides of the truck bed). Works great."
2,Wore out with minimal use,"I bought this in January 2010. It was a great bar. Worked for as little as I used it. However, it only made it 2 years 10 months. I will be buying the Hitchmate because it has a lifetime warranty. I wish I did that in the first place. I honestly opened and closed this bar less than 40 times over its lifetime. The ratcheting is what wore out."
3,Lund 607002 Ratcheting Cargo Bar,"Works ok, but is at the limit to span an F250 bed. Probably works better with something smaller (narrower)."
2,Not so hot,This cargo bar routinely slip out of position. I've tried using it in various positions and at different amounts of tension but I never know when it's going to hold and when it's not. My truck has a bed liner and I suspect that is the reason why but I'm definitely a little disappointed with it.
1,disc won't load,My Blu-ray player isn't that old and is certainly not a 1st generation model. The disc is a replacement from the same vendor when the original one wouldn't play as well. This is the only Blu-ray disc I've had any problems with.
1,Playback only with Flash drive insert in the player USB port,"Both of my 2 BD player(Philips BDP3100/Sony BDP-S765) were uable to playback this ""THX1138"" BD. It playback up to the Warner logo and follow by a DVD icon shown at the screen and nothing else.Some people who encountered the same problem suggested that a 1G USB flash drive must be inserted in the BD player, I tested with a flash drive which was only left few hundreds MB free and it worked."
1,Will not play,This review is for the disc only not the movie itself. This disk will not play in my LG blu-ray player. It is the only disc I have that will not play. Firmware is up to date and still will not play. Will be returning.
1,wouldn't play,This blu-ray wouldn't play on my toshiba blu-ray player. It's the only blu-ray I have purchased from Amazon that wouldn't for some reason. I requested a replacement and that wouldn't play either. I'm from Australia.
5,The movie that started it all.,"First there was THX 1138, then came American Graffite, fallowed by Star Wars - Episode IV: A New Hope.This often forgotten classic is the film that started it all for Gorge Lucas. With the help of his friend Francis Ford Coppla, Lucas turned his award winning short student film into his first major Hollywood production.And now it has returned - fully re mastered, with a crisp clean picture and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound track. This Special Directors Cut Edition is sure to further wet the apitites of Lucas fans every where.Starring Robert Duvall as THX who lives in future underground factory city, talks to Jesus online, and is under constant in forced sedation. He then stops taking the drugs and truly discovers the world he lives in and the mechanical things he builds.A truly great film that must be seen to understood."
1,a piece of trash,"Just rented this movie and didn't like the movie. The film quality and sound is simply too poor. You can't understand what the people are saying when they do speak. There is so little speaking in the first place that it is difficult to tell what is going on. Its a movie you'd have to watch again and again to understand what is going on. Probably be best to read the script while you watch the movie. Truth is, if this movie was not directed by George Lucas than no one would watch it. Its not that original. Just a rip off of the themes from 1984 and Brave New World. You're better off buying those books and reading them then wasting your time with this piece of trash."
1,Sorry.....,"Love Spielberg, but you'd be better off with Soylent Green or Gattaca in your collection."
3,"Oh God, the irony..","The original THX1138 was a great film. The harrowing, alienating nature of industrial efficiency run amok brings out the Luddite in all of us. Yet the grotesqueries of this film pale in comparison to its sad ironies. The Lucas of today is unrecognizable in light of the lessons of this film. What is eschewed in THX1138 as dehumanizing machine supremacy is now taken for granted by the constant CGI ""updating"" of Lucas' many films, including this one! One can't help be mesmerized by the glaring irony of taking a film fundamentally commentating on the soulless, antiseptic machine world and running it through the CGI wringer. THX1138 looks shinier, fancier, and more visually impressive now, but it's like driving your new SUV to attend a Greenpeace rally: clueless."
2,George Lucas ruining his movies,"I didn't want to give this movie 1 star because the original version was phenomenal but the extra cg scenes Lucas sliced in are totally out of context and in bad taste with the film. Granted there aren't as many edits as the Star Wars massacre's but they're still there and they're horrible. Try to get a vhs copy and transfer it to dvd, even though most vhs copies are in bad shape by now."
5,"Buetiful, small time epic","This movie made great use of sets and silences. Robert Duvall delivers a convincing preformance of a man who whishes to be free. No long speechs or boring dialogs telling you about the dangers of the future and of Tyrrany, simply a story of a man who wants to get out. I was tottaly enthralled by this movie, it is flawless through the ending (which I love).Despite my 'rave' review of this movie, I would still recommend atleast trying to rent it before buying, as it is not for everyone, though it certainly appealed to me."
1,No Respect!,"This review is about the Blu-ray version of this film; not the actual film itself. In a word- crap! I'm surprised that the fix for playing this movie is for the viewer to purchase more memory! Hey buy me some too! There's NO reason this film shouldn't function on current bluray players! WB is too cheap to fix this problem; and as long as people are willing to not complain, WB will continue to ignore it."
3,THX 1138,"This movie is a little slow and depressing. But as a piece of cinematic history, it's worth it to watch the whole thing."
2,You gotta Start Somewhere?,"Watch as more curiousity than anything else, between Lucas and Duvall and I'd never seen or heard of this. It was a bust. I think Duvall did an excellent job given the story and abstract nature of the story and lack of surroundings. Much of it was him and the camera or 1 other person. It is easy to see the interest in technology and its potential impact in future generations. He copuld propbaly remake this movie and do a far bette job with special effects and dialogue. I was sadden that Weismueller was a robot cop. I was hoping to see my old Tarzan or son of. You better be a fan, this was painful to get through but the ending was well done and probably the height of the movie."
5,THX 1138,"I watched this movie as a kid and thought it was very frightening. Re-watching it 30 years later was really interesting. The movie takes place in a totalitarian future where humanity is living underground. I like how everything is not explained in detail (which year is it, why are everyone underground, are there other countries and so on???). I was a bit worried about Lucas new cgi ""improvement"", but it is wasn't disturbing at all (most noticeable in some cityscapes and the car chase). This movie has certainly aged well, and with all the extras and the reasonable price, it is really recommended."
1,The what you would expect with Robert Duvall or George Lucas,"I watched this today for the first time. I am doing a bit of a Robert Duvall movie marathon and this was at my local library so I checked it out.It is a rather complex movie. I got the impression that the story was so complex that trying to put it on film did not do it credit. The acting was very choppy. Everyone spoke in numeric terms, always citing numbers. I guess that is utopian perspective of the future.Overall, not a good movie in my opinion. Robert Duvall didn't get the opportunity to really act in this movie and all the characters were so limited in development that it was a real disappointment."
4,Loved it. Wouldn't recommend to non-sci-fi fans.,"The film's dystopian vision comes through. The populace function as little more than a mass of drones. Individuality, it seems, has been suppressed the sake of industrial efficiency. I suppose that anyone who has worked in a cubicle or has taken a menial job can relate somewhat to the characters. A more complicated or involved plot and more dialogue may have detracted from the vision. However the movie seems incomplete and more dialogue and a stronger plot, if done correctly, would have helped the film. I enjoyed THX 1138 but would not recommend it in general. It just wouldn't appeal to the mainstream as most would find it dull or depressing. However sci-fi aficionados, which I suspect are what most people reading this are, should see this movie."
1,The souless THX,"At first it doesn't seem like this film has been as reworked as Star Wars.The original cut tells a far different story.The Director's Cut of THX 1138 has entirely recomposed shots and loads of brand new CGI enhancements(not to mention new color timing) that completely ridicules the film's original message. I had high hopes for both versions to appear on Blu-Ray, but am now resigned to keep my cherished Laserdisc.Do yourself a favor-check out the original 1971 theatrical version (available on VHS and Laserdisc) and the original student film upon which this is based."
3,Strange but unique,"I have to say that this is one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen.This is definitely one that is one of a kind.Although not a great movie, it was a good start on Lucas' part"
4,an astonishing debut !,"George Lucas' first film is a frightening look into a future where mankind is ruled by computers and kept in line with drugs. Robert Duval is incredible as THX1138, the man who breaks away from the system and discovers his emotions. This is a small but mighty movie and a must for all sci-fi fans !"
3,"Lucas, The Destroyer","I wish people would forget that George Lucas (who would eventually be famous) made this movie. At the time he was an unknown director. Maybe the director credit should deleted from all databases.The original THX-1138 (which I own on laserdisc) is a masterpiece. It is an art film about the future and is disturbingly realistic. The claustrophobic feel, perfect soundtrack and visual effects are brilliant.What we have on DVD is another story. As others have pointed out, the few CGI additions destroy the film. The new scenes that show vast, open areas conflict with the original filmmaker's intent. The replacement of the shell-dwellers (portrayed by midgets in the original) with vicious ewoks is downright laughable and totally obvious.Why can't we simply get a cleaned up version of this former masterpiece?[DW]"
3,Problems With The DVD,"THX-1138 is a great movie. And, the transfer and sound are beautiful. If that was all, I'd give it five stars. However, I need to make it clear that their are serious techincal flaws with the DVD. I've had two DVDs and tried them on mutliple players. In each case, the movie freezes at two points and the English subtitles just turn-on.I'm currently debatng whether or not to just return the second disc and wait until a later date to see if these problems have been corrected, but buyers should aware that this does not appear to be an isolated incident. Has anyone else experienced these problems (or others) with the DVD?"
1,stupid,"This has got to be the absolute stupid movie! As stupid has Amazon making one wriye at least twenty words when a few words say all that I really have to say. Yes, I bought it on Amazon but I rarely shop here and I regret this purchase."
2,Misses Potential,"This film had so much potential and really could have been a cut above the rest. However, this movie failed to grab my attention or clearly show a story line or even explain itself. If you have seen ""The Island"" then you know that movie borrows heavily from ""THX 1138."" Similar to ""Logan's Run,"" but IMHO, not as good. I can't really place my finger on what is lacking, but I believe a re-make of this movie could really be excellent. Watch at your own risk."
3,"Another bad ""director's cut""",I hate it when they screw up great old movies by adding unwanted and inappropriate scenes. Boooo! I subtract two stars from an otherwise five-star movie to punish George Lucas for insulting our intelligence with lame special effects--pathetic eye candy in a movie whose initial charm owed a fair amount to stark minimalism. Did I say boo?
5,THX review,its a great piece of sci fi history... and the second disc documentary is my favorite part of the set.
5,Great memories,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out with my dad. One of the few movies I remember going with him. The car chase was burned into my meory. I haven't seen it since, and yet that chase scene remains with me. But it was the mood of the film, the use of light and shadow, emotion, sound, that makes it stand out for me. I was looking for it just last week and was disappointed it wasn't out. So I'm glad it's finally going to be released!I hope the director's cut makes it just like Lucas wanted it originally, and not with his ""refined"" sensibilities. I'd like to see it through his eyes back then."
5,I was absolutely hypnotized the first time I saw it!,"I've heard a lot about this movie over the years, mostly negative comments. so naturally I avoided it, even though I was a huge fan of George Lucas. It wasn't until 1997 that I saw it on the Bravo channel. I sat motionless through the entire movie. I'll admit I didn't get it the first time, or the second time for that matter. But I watched it everytime it came on ,and eventually realized not only how visually haunting it was, but how a civilization like this could actually exsist in the future. And of course there are those familiar sounds and camera angles youv'e seen in the original Star Wars movie. The clumsy police in this movie seemed like crude versions of stormtroopers . The more you watch it the more similiarities you'll see.If youv'e seen all the other Sci-Fi garbage out there and want to see an original, CHECK IT OUT! I sure hope George Lucas releases a ""special edition"" of this movie. That would be great!"
2,"more like, SUX 1138","this movie wasnt as exciting or interesting as i anticipated. especially for being such a ""classic"". if you want to see a very moving and interesting documentary about social control or govt influence, WATCH ""TERRORSTORM"". that DVD will certainly surprise you!"
1,A great film now ruined,"The reworking of this once-classic movie disgusts me. It's now a cheezy sci-fi B movie.If this blu-ray came with a theatrical cut, I would have given this 5 stars."
1,Couldn't get it to play,"Ordered quite a few movies all at once, and it took me a while to get to this one. I put it in my player, and it just freezes. I could let it go for hours but it would never play. There's no USB jack on the player so the trick mentioned in other reviews will not work for me. And to top it off, I managed to just miss the 'return window' for this item, so I can't even return it for a refund. What a pain!"
2,What The hell Is So Great About This Movie?,"You know, I can't stand the fact that this movie was directed by George Lucas. Practically the whole movie is boring, even the ending isn't a whole lot good. The girl should have had some hair, and not saggy breats. Movie stars are suppost to look good. There was one funny part though. Robert Duvall trys fighting with a robot, when his jimmy's hanging out. That would be so stupid that it's funny.That's all I can say about THX-1138. That's about all that happened."
1,The disk that won't play,"I don't know if this is just a problem with sony Blue Ray players or all players with this disk (THX-1138 Blue ray version only.)I purchased the movie and when I got it I atempted to watch it, but to my disapointment it would not get passed the first two screens. I tried it on the other 3 blue ray players we have in the bedrooms, It would not work on any of them. The blue ray player on my home theater was freezing anyway so I decited to buy an new player, it would not play on the new player either. So I returned the movie to Amazon and received a new one two days latter, I would not play either. This player had a wireless internet connection so I updated the players chip, it still would not play. Before giving up and Just for kicks I tried it on my laptop which has an HDMI port to hook up to my home theater, It played!! The moral of the story is just buy the standard DVD and sit back and enjoy tht movie, the Blue Ray version isn't worth all the trouble."
3,Sci Fi,Definitely a B Movie. I had to watch it twice to half way understand what was going on. But would buy again for my collection.
4,for playback issues..add extra memory to blu-ray player,"The blu-ray would not play (as noted by other reviewers). I have 3 players and it did not work on any of them.An older Sony, a new Toshiba and a newer Panasonic 3D player. I added 16GB of USB memory to the Toshiba and 8GB SD memory to the Panasonic player.This solved the playback problem. I like the movie but I thought it would be useful to post help for the playback issues reported."
1,what's wrong?,"First off, let me say that I love this movie. That is, I loved it when I saw it on tv in the early '80s and again on my betamax vcr. As for this new DVD release, my advice is to avoid at all costs. Besides the fact that the English subtitles kept turning themselves on somehow throughout the entire movie (at least on my JVC player they did), I had no idea when I purchased the disc that this ""director's cut"" has had new CGI effects added. For me they detract from the realism and pretty much ruined the stark setting of the story. $20 down the toilet. It's ironic that Lucas and co. have probably spent many hours and gazillions of dollars working on the new special (d)effects but couldn't spend 2 hours watching 1 copy of the actual DVD to see the technical problems with it.The future is over."
4,NOT A MOVIE FOR AN AVERAGE PERSON,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SF MOVIES OF THE LAST 5 YEARS . BUT WAIT , IT IS NOT FOR THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL WHO WANTS TO TAKE IT EASY AND FORGETS ABOUT THE MOVIE AFTER IT ENDS.THIS MOVIE IS NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND NEITHER TO OVERLOOK. IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AND ENERGY TO START A PERSONAL EVALUATION AFTER IT FINISH, BUY IT AN ENJOY."
3,Mind movie.,"This movie is good in concept and idea, however tend to be boring but nevertheless captivating."
5,Great Film,"I loved THX 1138.The sets are great,and the musical score by Lalo Schifren is very eerie.The movie makes the future look very bleak,all the people are sedated,society has moved underground, and computers run everything.There are some really cool looking robot cops,and there is an excellent chase scene through the underground tunnels.It is amazing that the film was made on such a small budget.(it's a lot more interesting film than most of today's mega budget movies!)Look for references to this movie in American Graffiti(John Milner's license plate no.THX 138)and Star Wars.(when Luke had the stormtrooper uniform on he talked about cell block 1138)Overall I'd say sci-fi fans would probably love this film,others might not.I know I loved it!"
4,Don't get rid of your VHS yet!,"I just saw a screening of the ""director's cut"" - being a big fan of the original film - and was disappointed by the CG scenes that were created for this new version. One of the things that made the original so good was it's stark, minimalistic vision of a distopian future.I wish that mr. Lucas would realize that his earlier science fiction films ( widely acknowledged to be his best work ) should be left untampered by CG effects that do nothing to improve the story.Both directors and studios have been playing fast and loose with the term ""director's cut"" lately - which is supposed to refer to a version with scenes restored which were cut to receive a rating or as a result of studio pressure. Revision with new technology that wasn't available at the time, or re-adding scenes that were cut for a good reason, does not a director's cut make.That being said, THX-1138 is still the best film George Lucas has ever made - even with the new junk added."
5,no problems here....,"A previous reviewer says that the disc freezes and the subtitles kick in. I did not experience that problem when watching my disc.Also, the added CGI scenes are not that glaring unless you have the movie memorized. I had seen THX a few times before and I only saw one or two scenes that I did not remember. After checking the web, I found that they were CGI enhanced scenes.Great movie - Great DVD"
2,What's with the monkeys?,The equivalent of what mr Lucas did to this new version would be a mother subjecting her own child to cosmetic surgery. It's just wrong.
2,Stop George Before He Really Goes Too Far!!,"I can't believe it. I bought this DVD before reading the reviews, expecting it to be a digitally REMASTERED director's cut in the true sense of the word. Then while watching, and seeing the glaring CGI scenes, I realize director's cut in Lucas' vocabulary means 'anachronistic CGI enhancement'. Why does George insist on doing this? I think there needs to be a psychological term created to describe what he's doing, because it's just not sane. What's next? Digitally introducing a receding hairline on Ron Howard in American Grafitti? Maybe he could digitally add more scenes of Harrison Ford in the film? This makes me so mad, I'm gonna drop some money for a VHS copy of the film so I can see the original flick, unadulterated, unmangled, unface-lifted.Oh yeah, the movie and the background docs gets 5 stars. -3 for the digital enhancement."
1,Does not work!,"We've bought and exchanged this item twice! None of the blurays work past the ""Warner Brothers"" symbol. Must have been something in the making of the Bluray!"
5,"Enlightening journey through Muslim thinking on Gender, Sex and Ethics","Kecia Ali provides an amazingly clear and lucid writing on this very difficult and complex topic.She has a knack for being able to connect the past with the present as it relates to medieval muslim thinking about gender, sex, marriage, divorce, slavery, intimacy and a whole basket of related topics with the ethics related to them.Ms. Ali's other detailed and wonderfully intricate book titledMarriage and Slavery in Early Islamcoupled with this book is a perfect introduction to Muslims and non-Muslims alike who want to understand the ""structure"" and ""objectives"" of these institutions as they took form and evolved in the minds of the pre-modern/medieval Muslim scholars.Her discussion on this topic is timely and the relevance to today's Muslim scholars, thinkers and policy makers is absolute and is elaborated in a very clear and comprehensive fashion."
2,Not a good book,"This book did not offer clear explanations for statistics. In order to understand statistics better, I researched other sources and found that the explanations were much better than how Howell explained them. I would not recommend using this book."
2,"Difficult text, much better available","This is a difficult text, not only due to overly complex mathmatical coverage, but also due to the fact that answers are only given for half the questions asked in the textbook! That's right, only odd numbered are answered, making it impossible to check your work unless you purchase an Instructors Edition. It also focuses heavily on Minitab, and leaves out SPSS coverage which is the most widely used stats program for psychology. A much better approach is given inStatistics For People Who (Think They) Hate Statistics, which is dead simple and focuses on SPSS.Cavet emptor, buyer beware!"
5,review on statistical methods for Psychology,"nice book with wide cover of all the statistical techniques and introduction about how to apply the statisical methods with different software. Also, the writing style is friendly and it could be easily understood."
5,This book is excellent!,"This book is hot off the press just a few months ago. I've bought it and I'd really recommend it. Clearly laid out, lots of quick lists and tips. Chapters on self-diagnosis, doctors diagnosis, and most importantly what you can do for yourself, step-by-step (mostly diet changes).This book has the potential to be a life-changer and I'd highly recommend it."
4,Helpful -,"The primary value of this book is that it explains how hypoglycemia is often a precursor to diabetes, and how insulin's effectiveness decreases if one does not address and halt the progression. This was important to me because I was confused by the fact that while the immediate ""cure"" for low-blood sugar symptoms is sugar, paradoxically the problems are caused by too much sugar.The second major value of this book is simplifying what one should and should not eat - stay away from white flour products and other simple carbohydrates, as well as processed cheese, meat, and heavy fats."
3,Repeated information,I ended up selling the book; the information was duplicate of what I already had.
3,Good for young adults,"I read many Dragonlance Books in high school and greatly enjoyed them. I was recently reminded of this series and decided to go back and read it as an adult to see how it stands up. Unfortunately, not well. The characters have very little depth. Bad guys are all bad and good guys are all good and most show no character development over a book that spans nearly 50 years. The only character who shows any real development is Sithas and even there he end up right back in his old ways after the adventure in the mountains. The Deus Ex Machina ending was also a bit over the top, as was the willingness of the Dwarves to fight for half their lifetime on the plains."
5,My Favorite Book,"I've read the trilogy 3 times. ""The Kinslayer Wars"" is the 2nd book in the trilogy. It goes into the war that starts between the elves and the humans, but turns into a sort of ""world war"" when other factions join. Although the book covers the war in detail, the story isn't impersonal. There's still a focus on the main characters and Niles does a really great job of tying their story into the war in a way that's significant and believable. The most memorable part for me was the brothers' trek into harsh wilderness territory in search of a new type of mount that could help to tip the war in their favor. I liked the Chronicles, but the Elven Nations Trilogy is still my favorite and ""The Kinslayer Wars"" replaced ""Watership Down"" as my favorite book."
5,A must read,I love to read about the past of the Nations. This one was especially good though because the elves are very intriguing and two brothers fight each other reminded me of Raistlin and Caramon. I wish I could get a hold of the other two books.
2,A disappointing sequel in an otherwise fascinating setting,"First off, let me first say that I greatly enjoyed the first book in the Elven Nations trilogy. It wasn't high quality, but overall it did a good job portraying its characters and the setting, even with some cliches.The second book, Kinslayer Wars, is unfortunately very dreadful. The characterizations, particularly of Kith's brother Sith, seemed comnpletely off, the romance with the human woman felt forced; the villain selected was dreadful, and simply disappeared at the end of the book. Add on to that some low quality prose, a thread-bare plot, and a very disappointing ending, and you have this book.Part of the problem was that, after reading the first novel, I had high expectations. Thompson did a good job of creating an image of the Elven Society, and preparing the setting for the creation of Qualinesti, but the second book just ruined it."
1,this book is really bad,"I strongly disliked this book. It was too long and boring, and I thought, rather plotless. He really didn't do the charectors justice. It could have been alot (I mean alot) better. If you like being bored stiff, go ahead and read the sluff."
1,Not the real thing,"I have been wearing Samsara for years and was glad to find the products online as they are no longer available in department stores. But the cream that I ordered from Amazon smelled old or off, odd. I am returning."
5,Favorite Body Cream,I have beenn using the Samsara cologne and body cream for years! Amazon had it at a really great price and I was glad I could find it here. I love this fragrance in the winter months and the fall. It's not heavy at all. It had a woodsy fragrance and reminds me of winter. I love it!
1,Not the Genuine Article,"Like the other reviewers, I learned the hard way that this CD is not what I was expecting from something labeled ""The Very Best of Atlanta Rhythm Section.""These songs are apparently newly recorded versions of the familier ARS songs I was hoping for. I couldn't even tell if Ronnie Hammond was doing the lead vocals anymore.Not to say that these songs are all bad-the new version of ""Spooky"" features some very nice guitar work., as do some of the other songs with punched up drums or bass too. It's just that I wasn't buying this CD for new versions.I recommend instead the legit CD ""The Best of Atlanta Rhythm Section"" released by Polygram Records in 1997 as part of their budget series. You'll find original versions of ""Neon Nites"" and ""Large Time"" among others."
5,Japanese Silk Robe,"I would like to have seen a more detailed picture with the color ordered. However, the item came quickly and was very well made."
1,Funeral Kimono,"The girl is wearing the kimono incorrectly. The left goes over the right. She is wearing it as a dead person right now. If you are going to do kimono, please do it right with respect to the Japanese origins of it."
1,bored stiff,"really, I listened to this cd and couldn't believe how lousey it sounded .Completely over arranged and unconvvincing stuff.A waste of time."
2,The real mysteries are why would anyone watch it or why was it made.,"Well...someone else's review convinced me to buy it, but I may be able to help someone else avoid it. It was silly at best, as the actors (a term loosely used) waste their talent and time as they sleepwalk through this film before going out to kill their agent for getting them into it. It is meant to be light fare, but it is so poorly written and acted that the humor of the farce becomes pathetic rather than witty."
5,TO GOOD TO BE TRUE,"I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY THANKING GOD FOR GIVING THE WORLD SUCH A DYNAMIC VOCALIST, KIM BURRELL. I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH MS. BURRELL'S VOICE EVER SINCE I HEARD ""I COME TO TO YOU MORE THAN I GIVE"". I MEAN I ACTUALLY BEGAN TO CRY WHEN I HEARD THAT SONG. HER FOLLOW-UP ALBUM, LIVE IN CONCERT, IS OFF THE CHAIN. IT'S NOT ONLY INSPIRITATIONAL, IT MINISTERS. THE ENTIRE ALBUM IS OUTSTANDING, BUT, THERE WERE TWO SONGS THAT REALLY TOUCHED MY SOUL DEEPLY AND THEY WERE ""CALVARY"" AND ""TRY ME AGAIN"". I LOVED HOW SHE DISPLAYS JAZZ AND SALSA ON THE ALBUM ALSO. LET'S FACE IT, SHE IS ONE OF THE LEADING LADIES IN GOSPEL RIGHT NOW. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GO OUT AND BUY THIS POWER-PACKED CD BECAUSE NOT ONLY WILL YOU HEAR GREAT MUSIC BUT YOU WILL RECEIVE GOD'S WORD. IF YOU THOUGHT THE FIRST TWO CD'S WERE AWESOME, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN NOTHING YET. GO BUY IT!"
5,fantastic,"I bet you can't find to many other people that can do those riffs. Kim burrell can sing her butt off and she is definitely a woman of God. The music was tight, the video,and the cd was tight. Carl Thomas liked her because he was in the crowd. The cd and kim burrell is BAD!!! Go buy it!!"
3,Average,"I have to admit, I am a big Kim Burrell fan and I was a little disappointed with this project. The music was way too busy and the backgroud sounded off at times. If you watch it on video, you wonder how in the world the band made it off stage without fighting one another. It sounds like everybody was trying to get theirs in before the concert was over. Don't get me wrong, I'm a musician and a couple of the songs got my head bobbing. I believe the total project was average at best though. Everlasting Life blows this project out of the water. Kim I love you, but get somebody else to do your project. Those musicians were great, but together they were a nuisance to your songs. What in the world was the keyboard and organ player doing?! Was this their first time out? They looked like two big kids at Christmas time. Kim your voice is truly awesome(even more so live) and does not need to be overshadowed by your music."
2,it was aight,"The mix for this recording was horrible. It sounds like a bunch of noise, but kim did a pretty good job. The band sounded like the were in ""everybody solo mode"" which is unacceptable from prime musicians like sput, calvin, natural and maurice. the backround vocals were horrible, horrible, horrible, oh and did i say horrible. It seems like there should have been alot more preparation for this recording. I know it may have been a good time being during Holy Convocation but they should have waited, maybe it would have came out better.(oh and dont ever down tye tribbett and ga ever again)"
1,KIM BURRELL AND COMPANY AT THEIR WORST........,"This project was a hot mess. Especially with a high-caliber bandshe had on this. There's no excuse. She had the two of gospel's finest best drummers as well as 'Reese and Natural and Shaun Martin???? C'mon. It was just a show. Nothing more,nothing less.Too many egos in the house that night. No true worship or ministry. Just playchurch. Kim was a hot mess too. Watch the DVD. Shaun was acting like he never had a gig by the way he was bouncin' around makin a scene showing his *$$ on stage.Calvin and Sput in a middle-of-a-session drum-off. Those who gave this a high review don't know any better."
2,Can't hear Kim on this album,I first heard of Kim Burrell on the Donald Lawrence CD. Her voice is truly amazing and God sent. I was somewhat dissappointed with the Live Concert CD because the music drowned out her beautiful voice. The message is the Word but it's hard to hear on this CD. Hopefully the next CD will be a step above.
3,Not Kim Burrelll's Best,"I wasn't too impressed with this album as I have been with Kim's past albums. I only liked a few songs, and I mean, only a few of songs off this album. In addition, her voice sounded hoarse and the songs weren't anointed to me. I just didn't think the songs matched her style of singing. I give it three stars because I did like a few songs off the album, but it wasn't one of those albums that I wanted to listen to over and over. I've only listened to it a hand full of times since buying it."
2,Not too sure about this one..,"Yes, her band was the best thing on this CD. If you're a musician, then you'll really feel this one (as far as music and beats are concerned). However, a singer wouldn't necessarily get into this CD. She can sing and all, but there was just too much going on. The backgroud vocals were flat (particularly the one singing soprano) and turned up too loud. Actually, this recording was not polished like it should have been----SHAME ON YOU TOMMY BOY GOSPEL. I like about 3-4 songs on the CD. Kim is annointed and all, but I think this CD would have gone over better if she would have recorded it about 4 years from now."
1,Live in Concert Kim Burell,I bought this project about a month ago and have never been more dissapointed in a CD. The background drowned out her voice and I still haven't quite figured out what style of music this was.I have heard her sing on Bobby Jones Gospel and was pretty impressed. I just think she hired the wrong people to do this project. I know that I will never purchase her music again without reviewing it first.
4,Pentatonically-Deminishically OUT THERE!!!,"Can anyone tell me what key Kim Burrell sings in. I sometimes wonder if she can... just kidding!! I'm a piano teacher, and if I had to teach someone to play any of the songs on the C.D, I'd refer them to Kim Burrell-personally. If you're a ""serious"" hip-hop jazz lover, you'll love this C.D."
5,As Good As a Book Like This Can Be,"Books like these are tediously boring. At least most of them are. But this book was actually quite interesting. Nancy Vhymeister discusses how to choose a topic, write a thesis proposal, conduct research, take notes, create bibliographies, contruct footnotes and end notes, and she also introduces the student to software and internet websites which will provide the most help.She even has a final chapter about how to prepare a final project for the Doctor of Ministry degree.I'm not looking forward to all the other books in this genre that have been assigned to me, but I am happy to report that this one was helpful and held my interest."
4,Great Book Club Selection,"Greeley and Neusner lead the reader across Biblical terrain which most readers will think that they already know. Yet, each leader offers profound observations that will surprise (if not surprise and delight) the reader. Greeley and Neusner may not ""bring Christians and Jews together,"" but an honest reading may improve one's understanding and increase one's respect for ""the other."" Reading this volume with a group including a knowledgable Muslim may offer the richest possible view over the texts at the core of three great religions."
5,on the problem of emptiness,"Joel Sternfeld's work as a conceptual photographer exhibits a degree of understanding of emptiness, of unspoken gaps, of silence. He is taking the pictures of the places where famous tragic events in America were taking place, some years after the fact. The photographs are creating a very strong sense of the ""negative event"" space, where something which is not told is infinitely more important that what was told. Also I highly recommend Joel Sternfeld 's most recent exhibition catalog ""Stranger Passing"", where he travels the roads of America, and takes pictures with his large-format camera. Although all his pictures include people in various situations (attending a party, selling coffee, hanging out in their own homes, vacationing, promenading, relaxing, observing, working), what he is really interested in, is the depiction of landscapes and soft outplay of the mid-afternoon light."
4,Terrificly Somber,"This book is both beautiful and movingSternfeld takes you to the sites of some ofhumanity's worst moments, and presentsthem literally in a new light. You might evenlearn some history."
5,real-funk,"all of these artists play together well, it is like they are in your living room, the only thing you need is your friends, good food and beverages and the rest will flow, for an enjoyable evening time after time, these artists are very tight sounding, great vocals, the sound is very up to date."
1,cheesecake pudding.?.......not really!,"Not even close, nobody cared for it, now I have a case to get rid of! Ugh!"
3,"""The Power of One""",This movie was a pretty good movie. If you like Educational types of Films. The movie its self was about a white south african boxer doring WWII.This movie is deffinitly for a sports fan. The politicization was very dramatic. You should deffinitly see this movie
4,The Power of One,"I had the Audiobook, which was terrific, so I thought I'd watch the movie. It was somewhat different than the book (no girlfriend) but enjoyable nonetheless."
3,after reading the book the movie is disappointing.,"This movie by itself is beautiful and inspiring. The music and scenery is wonderful. But, as you may have guessed by now after reading a few comments from viewers, those who have not read the book enjoyed the movie immensely, and those who read the novel by author Bryce Courtenay found the movie just skimming the surface. Maybe it's not possible to put all of the richness of the many characters in a 2 hour movie. (How about a series?)So, here's a suggestion, watch the movie, enjoy it, and then treat yourself to a great read. (Not the other way around.) When you're done with The Power of One read the second book by Courtenay, Tandia, which is a continuation of the story and even more of a masterpiece than the first."
1,the movie is NOT the book!,"After reading the book, this movie was an utter disappointment. If you liked the book, which is one of my top 5, skip the movie. You'll hate it."
3,"ok-movie, but nowhere near as good as the book","The movie is ok, but in fact a disappointment when you see it after you have read the book. Many characters who played an important role in Peekay's life are omitted, and others are created. The movie is rather superficial compared to the book, and the characters don't have the charisma they have in the book."
2,Not at all Like the Book!,I ordered this DVD after listening to the audio version of the book and was highly disappointed! It was basically a shell in comparison and very weak.
3,This Movie is a Pencil Sketch - the Book is an Oil Painting,"The movie is quite good, but can't begin to tap the depths of feeling the book conveys. However, the movie retains its focus a little better than the book did. If you can't stand to read, see the movie. Otherwise, go straight to the books section and buy the novel. Then buy the soundtrack and listen to Hans Zimmer's excellent African folk music score."
5,"'' THE POWER OF ONE ""A TRULY INSPIRING MOVIE","This movie was an excellent portral of P.K's life and work. I can't think of enough words to describe this movie. The actors,setting,scenery and all other asspects of this movie were wonderful.I think this was a truly inspiring tale we should all learn from his example. I felt sadness for the wasy he had to endure all the hardships of his life,but triumphed in the end. I did not like the man who played his best friend I thought he could have played the roll a bit better. I did not like the apartheid issue in South Africa. I thought it was a bit disturbing. I think the acctors and directors deserved an Oscar. One warning i do not reccomend this movie fo young children or people who can't stand gruesome scenes. On a final note I think this was an inspiringmovie and we should all use are ""Power of One""."
1,Power of One DVD,"I had read the book ""The Power of One"" again and thought the original opinion about it was right on. It is a great book. I learned there was a movie called ""the power of one"" and sought it out. What a dissappointment. The only thing that resembled the book was the title. I could not even finish the movie it was so bad and distorted."
2,Don't see the movie,"I loved the book, but I thought the movie was terrible... Apparently the girl comes from the sequel to the book, but I don't know why they put her in this movie... They changed the entire plot, many names, removed characters, and I can't believe they gave Hoppie's line to Geel Piet. Read the book."
5,Most Excellent does not fully describe!,"This movie is a favorite choice of mine. I don't know if this movie received any awards - but it sure received high ratings from me. It must of taken me months before I actually rented it, I had been told it was a very good feature but a movie about a young boxer didn't interest me in any way- boy was I wrong!!"
2,Silly and impeachable,"By making a white kid into the hero of the struggle against apartheid and the Messiah of the African races this movie reveals that behind its fell-good anti-racist message there lies something much darker: the unspoken assumption that blacks can only be saved by a heroic white man. On top of that the plot is almost unendurably silly, full of easy cliches and ridiculous situations. This is shame, because the cinematography is excellent and Morgan Freeman and John Gielgud deliver, as usual, very solid performances."
2,Book Was Better,I found that the script of this movie was a bad attempt at condensing the characters and storyline of the wonderful into a 1 and a half hour movie.
1,Causes strenuous Work!,"i thought this movie was fantastic at first. then disaster struck! i received an assignment in which i had to relate Mandela's life to Pk's life. i was so stuck for words. i had no idea what to write and i spent so long stressing over it. Word of Advice: do not watch the movie at school, otherwise you'll receive a task to do on it!"
4,A movie you'll remember,"I first saw this movie on cable about 8 years ago, just after it had come out. I was just a kid then, but the message was still powerful. I saw it again as an adult, and I realized a whole new message. This movie (Stephen Dorff and Morgan Freeman, excellent as always) is very powerful. A little long, but intense; explores the dark side of Apartheid in a way that makes you want to learn more about the history of South Africa. Great boxing scenes and the scene with a young PK conducting a chorus of Bantu inmates at the expense of the German soldiers is priceless."
1,Read the Book,"I read the book, the original 500+ pages, before I saw the movie. If there are parts of the movie that you can't figure out, like the waterfall, you need to read the book. It's a great story and there is more to it than boxing. There is action, adventure, love, racial discord, courage, love of learning, sadness and joy. I would suggest that anyone, teen or adult, give the book a try. Sorry, the movie doesn't even come close."
2,If you haven't read the book. . .,"this is an entertaining film. I'd recommend it for people looking for a ""overcoming adversity"" story. It's better for younger students than the book would be, too, since the violence is toned down. Like most books made into movies, however, this film is so different from the book that they are almost two stories with the same title set in South Africa.I like using the movie when I teach the book, only because students are so unhappy with the movie and we can select the book scenes that SHOULD have been filmed instead."
5,Outstanding film!,"This was one of the most extrodinary films that no one ever saw. It's so unfortunate that it's marketing was bungled when it came out in 1992, because the story, the acting, the direction, the soundtrack and the script are all superb. Stephen Dorf leads an outstanding cast that shows not just the power of one person to make a difference, but the power we all possess when we come together as one."
2,Flat adaptation of a decent novel,"Corny, cliche-ridden story of a young English boxer who struggles for victory and freedom in South Africa, where his people are hated just as much as the black population. You can basically write the film yourself after Morgan Freeman tells the boy he is the ""rainmaka."" (Oh yeah, and Morgan, work on that accent.)"
4,good,"songs I like a lot , sonmgs I don't, always a clasic. I recommend this product...... ... ... ... ..."
3,Hello Dadlin -CONWAY TWITTWY-- RELEASED BY SUN,"This is by Conway, but it is not the orignal,""HELLO DARLIN"" The orig. has the songs: Rocky Top,I'll get over losing you, up comes the bottle, you & your sweetlove,hello darlin, Rose,Rueben James I never once stopped loving you,will you visit me on Sunday,blue eyes crying in the rain,I'm so used to loving you, & a repeat of, hello darlin. So be careful to get the right one. I made the mistake & now I am reordering the right one. The Cd by SUN only has 8 of his songs, two of which are on the original. So be careful you get what you want."
5,Outstanding!,"This is an outstanding rendering of these flute concertos. In particular, Mr. Wilson's phrasing and overall ""good taste"" are exceptional. A bonus is that this is a discount CD. I heartily recommend this recording."
1,These Stink! Literally ...,A woman's review ...These condoms leave a very strong RUBBERY scent in the air.Not so great when trying to be inconspicuous.Does its job but the smell is NOT pleasant.We've been using Lifestyles-Ultra Sensitive for a few years now.Give those a try instead.
1,Thick and STINKY!,Extra thick with a rubbery smell. It kind of kills the mood when you can smell the condom. Will not buy again.
3,building log homes,This was another book that I thought would have easy to understand instructions. I was wrong. To much filler and not enough detali
3,Okay not great,"It's a good general informational book. I think you could get the same information off the Internet and save a few bucks, but sometimes its nice to have a copy on paper."
5,Good Food For Anyone,"I was reciently diagnosed with high cholestrol. I've been haunting the library for cookbooks for food I can eat. This book was sitting on the shelf and reached out and grabbed me. Fried chicken and gravey, wow. This works for me, so I just ordered a copy."
5,The Last Pencil You'll Ever Need.,"Excellent pencil. Comfortable to write with an has an ingenious design. I've used many mechanical pencils, and with each one I'd always end up wasting lead by snapping off bits [of lead] when the pencil wasn't in use. This pencil has a feature which retracts the lead when you open the pocket clip (to presumably put in your pocket). Well worth the price, and would recommend!"
2,looks great but..,"this pencil looks great but if you are buying to use it rather than decorate it then i must say it feels heavy in the hand. If you are actually going to use this pencil to write or draw it won't be my choice but i have to give it, it looks great though.."
5,Great pencil! love it,"The pencil feels great in your hand, the double textured grip is very helpful and controlling your writing, and hiding pencil tip keeps it from poking your leg through your pants or making a hole in your backpack.A bit on the expensive side, but you can do more than just draft. Great for sketching (with appropriate lead), writing, drawing, note taking,"
5,Pentel Graph Drafting Pencil,"I love these pencils, but am only able to find them in university book stores where there is an engineering department. Thankfully, I found them on Amazon!"
3,"A very nice pencil, BUT...","It is a very nice pencil indeed, but it is sold without any kind of packaging or wrapper. That would be totally fine, if not for an ugly bar code sticker slapped right on its beautiful metal finish. Removing the sticker only made things worse, because a nasty sticky spot was left in its place and it took a lot of effort and alcohol swabs to clean up the mess.For this price, I wouldn't expect such a nonsense."
3,Not bad but the 500 is half the price,"I have both the 1000 and the 500. The 500 doesn't have the metal exterior nor the fancy ergonomics at the bottom. It is plastic with a metal handle for your fingers. Nonetheless at half the price I've found it just as good. If the fancy accoutrements are important to you than the 1000 is the way to go; if penny pinching means more, the 500 is not a shabby replacement and I like that it is lighter."
3,Go with the Graphgear 500 instead,"I purchased one Graphgear 1000 and one Graphgear 500 to test out replacements for my all-time favorite drafting pencil...a Paper Mate Pro Touch II (no longer available). While aesthetically pleasing, the balance of the Graphgear 1000 is poor. It is top heavy, compared side by side with the Graphgear 500 and as a result...not as comfortable to write with.One plus I found with the Graphgear 1000, compared to other drafting pencils, is the retractable tip. That being said, I also consider it a weakness. The added weight of the clip/tip retraction mechanism takes away from balance of this pencil.Summary: Save yourself $10 and go with the Graphgear 500 instead. If you want a drafting pencil and want something aesthetically pleasing, just spend an extra $10 (on top of the G 1000 price) and get a Pentel S20 instead."
4,Great for six months,"I bought this about a year ago and loved it at first. After about six months the the eraser would not stay up when I clicked for more lead (I did lose the eraser cap, so my fault on that). After another couple months the lead would no longer come out; part of the internal mechanism was sticking. I really love the pencil, but wish it still worked. I actually came on here to buy another one. A great pencil for six months is fine by me. I'm surprised I didn't lose it before three months was up."
5,Best pencil ever,"This pencil, and the others in this series, the 0.7 & 0.5 mm (I don't have the 0.3 mm), are well crafted, balanced, and feel very good while writing or drawing. Every time someone uses the pencil, they always ask ""where can I get one of these""."
2,Not as sturdy as it looks,"When the Pentel Graph Gear 100 arrived I was ecstatic. It was tough, reliable, didn't leave holes in my pockets, and was just a great pen to hold and to show off.And while it worked it was a charm, I took it with me everywhere. However it has one major drawback, and that is the pocket clip. After two months of having in my pocket, the clip broke off, and unlike other pens/pencils, that means that the entire device is useless. The pocket clip keeps holds the tip in place when in use, and hides it when depressed. Graphite would not come out of the tip after the clip broke.It is a good thing I still carry cheap bic pencils, some have withstood nearly a decade of use. This is a shame, because if it was more durable the Pentel Graph Gear 1000 would be perfect. Come on guys, at least give me a years use for the money."
3,Looks nicer than it performs,"I bought this due to its glowing reviews, but am not a fan.Pros:-solid body construction-advances lead very preciselyCons-grip is not tacky enough-clip wiggles when you write (very annoying)-eraser isn't a twist one-lead indicator is cheaply constructed and harder to use than it should be to use-not comfortable if you hold down low on your pencil.I feel a lot more comfortable using either a alvin draftmatic or protouch ii (my favorite)"
2,Not suitable for long-term use,"I bought this pencil as a replacement for the cheap plastic mechanical pencils you find at grocery stores. The pencil is gorgeous, feels great when writing, and the retraction mechanism is fantastic.However, I had two main problems after extended use:1. The lead easily got jammed and was not gripped properly, even at the beginning of a shaft of lead.2. The eraser diminished quickly. Although you can push the eraser up to expose more of it, it would slip back into the lead clicking mechanism every time you needed more lead."
4,she likes it-,"Fits perfect in the hand, easy to write with, and all you do is pull cap off to get to eraser. Best of all it's a refillable pencil."
1,Wastes Lead and Very Uncomfortable,"Once you get down to about the last 1/4 of stick of lead you are using, the tip fails to hold the lead in place (so that when you try to write, the lead is pushed back into the pencil). This forces you to waste 1/4 of every stick of lead - which is not only an annoying inconvenience, but also is expensive. This should not happen for a 15 dollar pencil. Furthermore, although many may disagree, I found the pencil was exhausting to use because it was so heavy and unbalanced. Thus, looks and nifty features aside, this pencil fails at the most basic functions of a mechanical pencil."
2,Packaging was horrible.,I received this as the pencil thrown into a large manila envelope with the small bubbles walls. The pencil wasn't wrapped or in a package and was free floating in the envelope. I didn't feel it was secure in anyway. Hard to tell if it was even a new pencil or one someone threw one in the mail out of their pocket. Hard to present it as a present with no packaging of any kind..It should have been better protected.The item itself is a gift and this review does not address the product itself.
1,"looked cool, didn't last long","In the store these pencils cost upwards of $30.00 so it was a considerable savings on Amazon. It didn't come in the original packaging with extra erasers and leads like in the store. It was in a bubble wrap envelope. It could have been damaged in transit just enough for it to fail outside the return window, I don't really know. I will say that I've never had a mechanical pencil that stopped working- I lose them. First the retracting feature began to fail. It was temporarily remedied by disassembling the pencil and applying silicone grease to the mechanism. After that the lead stopped feeding through. Oh well... if you want to have it in your pocket to look cool this is the pencil for you. Otherwise buy something else."
1,Sucks,"Looks cool but after a month, the lead got stuck. After I got the lead out, the lead would not come out anymore. Ended up having to cut the pencil up to remove the lead."
5,excellent!,"I recvd it next day after ordering-terrific pencil, heavy but weighted well grip steel cut metal..awesome product n great service!"
5,Great Mechanical Pencil (shop Amazon sellers for a great deal...),"This is a great mechanical pencil - in fact I now use the .5 and .7 versions of this model more for writing than anything other than my keyboard. The tip easily retracts, it is very comfortable to hold, and if you check the price from various sellers through Amazon you can find it for a little more than $10, which is about 50% of what other online sellers and some big-chain art stores are selling them for.I liked this the Graph Gear 1000 so much I also bought the .5, .7, and .9 sizes and use them all at various times, but if I were going to get just one however, I'd go for the .7mm, since its large enough not to break and small enough to not look like I'm writing with a big black graphite stick..."
4,Great gift,"Got it for my sister for college, since she constantly has to take notes during class. She finds it really comfortable to write with and really quite sturdy.The weight of the pencil may feel rather unattractive, but the mechanics that goes into the pencil makes it so that there is less effort in pressing down on the paper when you're writing, thus causing less strain on your wrists.Only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the design of the pencil. But that's simply my preference since I like my pencils to stand out more."
5,Best Pencil I know of,"I bought this one and an ""Uni Kuru Toga"" and I like the Pentel much more, it's heavier and doesn't feel cheap. The retracting head is interesting and seems to work pretty well. I liked this so much I got the .5mm as well"
4,Solid Pencil,"when you take lid out of this pencil, little noise occurs.it's good to use for everyday use for not only students"
5,Best Mechanical Pencil I've ever had!,"I like this pencil. I chose this pencil because I like to use mechanical pencils. I bought a lot of PLASTIC pencils, which wasted my money. These also breaks easily. I've had this metal pencil before and it was stolen in class. Since the pencil performs the best, I've ordered another from this seller. I recommend everyone to buy this if they like Mechanical Pencils."
5,Fantastic,"I purchased a 0.5mm Graph Gear 1000 before Christmas, along with one for my brother, and I have been using it for well over 2 months now. I'm an engineering student and I absolutely love how rugged it is. One huge plus for me is that the little eraser, which is Pentel's standard, is held using a metal sleeve so as not to deform with continued use as the P205 does. It feels very comfortable in the hand, and the gel grips along with the knurled surface are a perfect balance of soft with roughness for grip. It took a bit to get used to the retractable tip that's held out by the clip, but now it's very nice. Only complaint I could say about it is when you retract the tip, sometimes the eraser cap can get launched with how strong the return spring is. The pencil is well balanced for wonderful accuracy in detail for equations and diagram sketches. I know my brother really enjoys his, and I've never enjoyed using a mechanical pencil so much. Pentel did a wonderful job."
5,Great pencil,"Not that I am a pencil aficionado, but I have found writing using this pencil to be enjoyable. It has a comfortable heft to it, and the springs feel strong (but not too much). I use an external eraser (also from Pentel), but the included one erases rather well, without becoming un-removable after wearing it down over time like the cheap plastic ones do."
5,Great,"Writes nicely, feels nice and looks sharp! I love it!Only thing i would change be the clip, it's a little flimsy."
2,Clip won't last,"After purchasing two of these pencils, and I am thoroughly convinced that the clip is too flimsy. In both cases the clip becomes broken or too loose after only very light use. By comparison, the Alvin draftmatic is more reliable and is now my pencil of choice."
2,Broke within 5 minutes of opening.,"I think this would be a great mechanical pencil, except that I never got a chance to use mine. It is literally broken into two pieces less than 5 minutes after opening it. I tried to turn the lead indicator, which was ridiculously tight, and the darned pencil just snapped in two right where the grip attaches to the main piece. Admittedly I probably shouldn't have been twisting it so hard, but they do advertise the lead indicator as a working feature.. I think this is a good if not great pencil, but the lead indicator feature is garbage."
5,Eye opening,"I discovered this book by searching on amazon. I am only 3/4 of the way through it and my reaction is WOW! I picked up this book because I'm a newly wed and trying to make sense of the pull of my own needs vs. satisfying the needs of my wife. This book is a little more philosophical than providing tips on marriage. However, it did make me think of caring for my wife as also providing growth for myself. As a side benefit it gave me a new perspective on my work. As someone approaching 40, it helps make sense of life after my ideals of youth have turned into more practical responsibilities and choices. It is a more mature example of the self-help book. Not just overly selfish and inwardly directed, it is about caring for the growth of others and the ideas you value. It is rather short and not too difficult to read. I urge you to look for it."
2,Boring,"Boring, Boring, and Boring, however if you can get through reading the book the information seems a little more like common sense information."
5,One of the most important books of the 20th century,"Must admit that I was a colleague of Milton Mayeroff at the time he was writing the book and would meet him in the faculty coffee room to discuss it with him. And that it has influenced my thinking since the 1960s. Think it is one of the most important books produced in the last century. Bought three copies for my adult children to help guide them in their lives. ON CARING is a succinct, easy-to-read treatise (psychology, philosophy, social psychology) on the processes by which man fully enters into his/her world and comes to find a rich and fulfilling place in that world."
2,Poor Photos,The Clymer HD manual was a huge disapointment the photos are not clear and the information and service directions are both unclear and incomplete. I would not purchase this manual as an HD repair manual again.
5,Perfect for Summer!,"The Color is Beautiful, and weight is just right for this time of year. I love the satin trim, the bed looks great with just the blanket on."
2,Poor product,"The binding does not lay flat and the material is not soft, but actually is so stiff is makes noise you move it. I am considering returning it. It's a cheap product that I paid a lot of money for."
1,Noisy,This blanket was too noisy so we sent it back. When you moved in bed there was a crinkley sound.On a positive note Warm Things promptly got our refund to us.
3,At Least it is shorter than the movie,"After sitting through the movie I gave this a shot. It was better, not because of content (although that helped) It was shorter than the flick...."
1,Bloody Rip-off!!!!,"why buy it now when you can watch it for free in [...]Besides, they are going to have dvd edition where to movie and the production diaries will be of one package.Whats the hurry unless you are a die hard PJ fan...Waste of cash...."
2,"Okay, but NOT enough","I purchased each expanded DVD set for LOTR, enjoying the extras, and had been downloading some of the production diaries from the KongIsKing website until I heard they would be issuing these DVDs. I decided to stop ""wasting"" my time downloading and just purchase the set. Note: the downloading wasn't illegal, since even encouraged by the site, but was prohibited once they issued this DVD set. Unfortunately, despite the hefty price for 2 DVDs, only a handful of all production diaries are on each DVD; these easily could have fit on one DVD. Moreover, no pre-production or post-production diaries are on the DVDs. The only reason to get this set is if you're into marketing chotchkies which, though hokey, are creative. The set still has limited use in instructing film students -- the reason I wanted the diaries -- but I was sorely disappointed with my purchase. I emailed the KongIsKing site about my disappointment, but no answer after 2 weeks. Peter, where are you?"
5,Well Put Togeter...........,"Production Diaries was done very well peter explain everything and show how the music, effects and the actors and crew work with everybody...HEY SSEES StudentLook at this way, peter jackson did Bryan Singer a favor by calling him to help him out because we all know that king kong is going to do much better than superman returns. Why you dont tell everybody that Bryan Singer wanted to steal some production crew from peter jackson set. Plus it's peter jackson,i dont think bryan singer would have did it for any body else he know how good peter is, did he ask him to do it for LORD OF THE RINGS......"
3,Pretty good.,"If you want to know every detail about the making of King Kong, then buy this. Otherwise, you may get bored like I did."
5,The packaging alone is amazing . . .,"Just received this set in my hot little hands . . . had it delivered at work, and it's killing me not to be able to open it up and watch everything from start to finish. While the packaging will take up some shelf space, it is nothing less than stellar. Very, very cool for Kong and Peter Jackson fans. I know the features won't disappoint, as there's nothing else even remotely like this. Ultra-cool!"
3,This one's also o.k...,"...Well anyway the books o.k. It's worse than 'Throne of Bhaal'but still not the worst bk. I ever read. It at least doesn't get boring like some terrible bks. I've read. I wrote a review for Throne of Bhaal already; there still are mature acts in the bk.I don't think its stupid its just...... Anyway readers, don't try readin' this book if you haven't read any other great fantasy from DL and FR. Ignore the other reviews.O.K... it wasn't what any of us expected and its sometime's confusin' and the game's 'much' better but that doesn't mean you can't read the book. Just read this book when you have lots of time on your hands. It ain't the worst bk. in the world so its worth a try.Read it when you're good ready!Nathan"
3,Sweet love,"""Sweet love"" Which is mostly what ockered in this book. Next to vilent areas(several) vilent areas, this book apears to have no general, predictable plot. It's a fairly short book, took me one day. the most interesting part is with Iomen i\and the Matron mother to be, in bed."
2,"Well, I've read better books...","I am the Polish translator of this book, so I think I have the right to express my opinion about it. From my point of view there is nothing to complain, because the novel is easy to read, easy to translate, the words and phrases are easy, not taken out of the blue... but that's only one side of the coin. Maybe it's easy to read, but doesn't force reader's mind too become strongly involved. The plot is very simple, sometimes even lacking, on every step it is visible that this is the novelisation of the computer game and such books are not the artworks of literature. I recommend this novel only to the most devoted fanatics of the game and for those who read everything with the ""Forgotten Realms"" logo. People who would like to start familiarizing themselves with the Realms with this book (or it's first part) are rather advised to read R.A. Salvatore."
1,Not appropriate (IMHO) for preteens/kids,"I was quite disappointed and somewhat shocked. In addition to the poor writing style/etc. pointed out by the other reviewers I was disturbed to find a sexual encounter with a vampire and then a lesbian sexual encounter later in the book. I am by no means a prude and recognize the rather explicit nature of our society today, however it still surprised me to find them present.I have long been a fan of the D&D; based/themed books (Dragonlance, FR series, etc.) but this really is trash. I hope it does not reflect the nature of the other D&D; books which are out there since my son enjoys reading them - and I certainly hadn't expected this type of content. I'm going to need to catch up on my reading (yes, we do censor what our child reads/watches/etc.) before allowing my son to read any more in these settings."
3,Pretty good,"If you are a fan of D&D or similar fantacy stories, this is a pretty good book. If your expecting it to be just like the pc game you might be a bit disappointed. If you just enjoy a good fantacy story about fighters, mages, vampires, druids ect. it should be quite entertaining."
5,Very Entertaining,"Just finished this book....good thing I never played the game, I found it very exciting, very fast paced. Just when I thought it was slowing down....it reeled me back in and stepped on the gas.Totally respect the gamers for their reasons most of them don't like it. But just for being a book by itself....its really good. IMHO so far, I would place this trilogy up there with, dare I say...get ur stones ready.......'Icewind Dale' trilogy, but in a simplistic way, because 'Icewind Dale' tril. is such an Epic....most likely the Best of the Realms...but does it compare to'The Lord Of The Rings'....grandfather of all fantasy novels/series?Maybe.But for 'Baldur's Gate II - Shadows..', it is very well written....enjoying this trilogy immensely.Forgotten Realms Cranks...alot better than that other series......initials are DL.Thank You for ur time."
4,Good Read,"I personally have never played the baldur's gate game , so I had no pre-conceived notion about the characters or setting of the book. All I can say is that the book on it's own merit is an enjoyable work of fiction and it did what it was intended to do, keep me entertained. I understand that there are those that will gripe about how different the book is from the game, that's understandable, as the book is written and the game is programmed by different people. Those who expect everything to be the same between the two should take a moment to realize the world (or the realms) is not a perfect place. Thank you Mr. Athans for a job well done"
1,urgh!,"Wow, this book is really really badly written. Anyone who is a fan of the Baldur's Gate games (as I am) should stay away from this book because it is terrible. It bears almost no resemblance to the game or any of the characters in any way. The standard of writing is extremely low."
2,Embarrassing,"The game i considered a trivial masterpiece. However, i later picked up this novel just to use as bathroom reading, it seemed short enough.The author sure left a lot of stuff out of the game, which would have probably made it a better book too. The romance with Abdel and Jaheira was still really lame (but atleast it didnt make me laugh like Baldur's gate one did though,) and Imoen, seems more like a plot herself then an actual character. If you want to read some good fantasy/adventure, try novels by RA Salvatore or Cunningham. For a truly submersive BGII experience, play the game and dont read the book, it gives FR a bad name."
3,Awful,"If you like a heavy-step and terribly slow performance of this symphony, sothis is your choice. I'm not into Klemperer's way with this work. I find the latter's 1957 recording from a live concert that is with no doubt far betterthan this one. The live performance is more vivid and better judged in tempiand sound balance. Not in agreement with Klemperer's way with this symphony, i think on that as the best 9th made by this conductor. In comparison, try toavoid this studio version. Being interesting documents, there are with no doubtbetter performances by another conductors (Fricsay, Furtwängler, Karajan...)"
5,Perfect Rollator walker.,"It is lightweight, and it folds up very compactly. Easy to take with you. Perfect. I recommend this to everyone. Price was very good as well."
4,A Call for Wisdom and Discernment,"I found this book in the basement and started reading it. It's a good challenge to the Christian church to discern the teachings of their pastors and to discern what motivates them. It is a call for pastors to become accountable to their people and to have devotional time with God each day.Keller contends that revival and refreshment in the church begins in the pulpit, and he is right. The book also takes aim at television ministries, calling these leaders to be biblical and to be pure.The book is out of print, but used copies are available and it is a quick and worthy read.The book is also a challenge to the layperson to become so filled with God's Word and god's Spirit that they will be able to discern the difference between a Spirit filled ministry and a counterfeit ministry.Keller is a voice in the wilderness, and my prayer is that we will listen to what it says."
4,very shocking,i rated this a 4 star inted of a 5 star for one reason it should have bee the whole body if it was a 5 star i would have rated it but the detail is amazing better then some 150 dollar modells and it is very strongly buildt worth more then they are selling it for
3,"Cute, but small..",Very detailed bank.. Very cute.. Just soooo small... Wish it was much larger.. Perhaps they'll offer a larger bank once they read all the reviews here?
4,Great :),It is what it is... a piggy bank... lol... it is good for my two yr old... he likes it... it feels and looks good too... for the price its very nice :)
4,Stylish soccer shoes at a good price.,"I purchased these shoes for grass volleyball - while they look and perform great, they were not designed for all the jumping. They worked great when getting to balls (Lots of traction), and they are super-light, but they really don't have enough padding in the soles for a day of jumping in them. So they are great soccer shoes, but not so great as volleyball shoes."
3,The Jungle Baseball Game,The book is in good shape until the last two pages which both have big tears.
4,Great phone--BEWARE OF AT&T!!!,"I had lost my phone that I got from ATT. I went to ATT to replace it. Since I was still under my 2 yr contract, all they had to offer was the lowest quality phone they have for almost $200. The girl there said I could buy a phone from ANYWHERE. She even mentioned Amazon, E-bay, etc.So I ordered this nice little phone from Amazon. Many things didn't work right on it. I took it to AT&T and they said it doesn't work right because it wasn't a ""AT&T ready"" phone and that it could not be corrected. I LOVED this Sony/Eric. phone. Lots of little goodies on it. I ended up having to buy a cheaper model of phone from AT&T at a ""discount"" price. PLUS since I ""upgraded"" (not) my contract started all over the day I purchased that phone. SO, the phone is great and was not the problem. AT&T was the problem."
4,good quality,i purchased this pinion gear to replace a damaged original part.very good quality and durable.4 star because it requires a standerd hex key to install and normally for rc metric is the commonly used.
5,Very pleased! :),"I ordered 2 sets of these highball glasses and 2 sets of the matching 9-oz rocks glasses. One of the rocks glasses has weird ring patterns in the glass but since I had 11 good glasses, I didn't want to go through the hassle of exchanging it. Other than that issue, my family and I are very pleased with these glasses - we've used them for about a month so far. They have a good weight and feel (not too wide, easy for small hands to hold) and the weighted bottom makes it more difficult to tip over a glass."
3,"Pretty, yet fragile","I was surprised to see the mostly positive reviews of this product, as that has not been my experience. I received 6 of these glasses as a gift, and over the course of 4 months, 2 of them have broken. They seem fine when washed in the dishwasher, but washing them by hand was the problem. If another glass clinked against one of these, it immediately broke. I can be pretty clumsy, but my husband is not, and he has broken some of these too. We also have 8 of the same style glasses, in the juice (9 oz) size, and 2 of those have also broken in the past several months. If you use your dishwasher exclusively, and aren't too clumsy, then you may like these glasses. They have a clean, simple look, but they do feel delicate in your hand. I will be replacing my glasses soon, and it will not be with more of these."
4,Everyday glassware,"I really like these glasses. I like the size and shape, but would like them to be a little heavier/thicker glass. Even with kids using these glasses, they don't break easily. We use them everyday for water, milk, mixed drinks, everything!! They look good and go well with everything!I would recommend these glasses to anyone."
2,An unfortunate let-down.,"This work is mostly a prep rally for investors who are considering offshore investing. To someone who is actively considering offshore investing, however, this book is a disappointment. I was hoping to see step-by-step instructions on opening offshore accounts, web sights, and legal case cites which regarded privacy rights and pro-taxpayer stances. Instead, the author goes on about 'how great it is' and 'why you should do it' with dark references to those conspiring against the wealthy. Further, this book (a 1995 publication) is already dated: certainly sophisticated offshore banks must have since set up secure websights for conducting business with customers (something deemed quite risky in the internet's infancy - i.e., 1995). In short: while of some value to the novice investor, those seeking a comprehensive resource need look elsewhere."
3,relevant to a degree,"An interesting analysis of current country havens. A little superficial in content, but of benefit to the non American investment watcher & initial investor. More specific set up detail would have been appreciated."
5,Great product,"This is a great product to keep your kiddo entertained, as well as keeping toys organized. We also bought the suction cup wall attachment which is perfect since we are moving soon. We also like the places for bottles and hanging washcloths, etc. on top. Love the colorful green."
5,Works great and SO cute!,"I have owned one of these since 2006. I absolutely love it. It does what its supposed to do, stays where you put it, and makes picking up toys so easy. We recently had to put it up though, our shower in our apartment has curved walls and this does not work if your walls are slightly curved. We're on the hunt for something that will work for us until we move and hopefully have flat shower walls again."
2,"Cute, but WILL NOT STICK","Every single parent with a kiddo under 5 seems to have one of these frog pods in their bath. Its bright, modern, cool design. It is also very large and holds A LOT of bath toys.However, there is one very significant problem. IT WILL NOT STICK. We have tried it on tile, on glass, on granite. We have used the suction cups and the sticky tape. We have patiently followed directions line by line. And its still comes crashing down after 1-2 hours.The only way this thing will work is if you use screws to permanently attach it to the bath. Very disappointing."
1,Damaged the tub,"I have had this item for a few years. It is attached to the side of the tub with the supplied suction cup piece. About once a month, I come in to find it in the bathtub with all the toys dumped out because it doesn't stay stuck to the wall very well. Finally, last week it fell and the toes on the frog knocked a hole in the fiberglass tub. For the time being, I was able to buy a kit and repair the hole, but I'm sure this will be an issue when I go to sell the house. I know I'd be concerned purchasing a house with a broken tub. Needless to say, the frog is now gone."
4,great product if you are creative,"I loved the idea of keeping two childrens' toys, soap, and misc. items separate and organized. The plus is that the frog does that. The negative is that we couldn't get them to stay attached to the wall. I went to the store and purchased a few of those strong suction cup hooks and attached the frogs to them. We have had no problems since then with them staying on the wall."
3,a dissapointment,"I gave it three stars because it is very cute and functional. BUT the included sticky tabs that attach it to the wall are useless. After reading other reviews on how the frog pod doesn't stay stuck, I decided to take my chances. I followed the instructions to a tee and only crossed one grout line. I waited the required 24 hours and placed two shampoo bottles and only a small amount of our lightest bath toys in it and in the middle of the night it fell off the wall. For the six or so hours that it stayed on the wall, I was very happy with the way it cleaned up and organized our shower. I suppose I could drill into the tile and attach it with screws, but not sure I'll go that far or return it."
2,Did not stick!,"We unfortunately bought this before reading the reviews. We followed the directions perfectly and it fell off within 10 hours. So we are going to try what another reviewer said, double sided sticky tape and see if that works. If not we will be returning it which is really a shame because it's really cute and a big space saver for our small bathroom. They should really work on a design to make it stick better!Update: We tried the sticky tape and it stayed for about a week and fell again. So we took it back."
2,save your money,Cute idea. Followed the directions exactly and it fell down after 4hours without any toys in it. What a shame. The adhesive is not strong enough. I went out and bought the netted one with suction cups for $5.00 and that works perfectly.
2,didn't stay mounted,"Had to return the product after it wouldn't stay on tile. Followed directions perfectly, since I was already skeptical about it staying. They should include a suction cup option. It is really cute though."
3,Great idea.... but had to adjust,This product is great. It fits a ton of tub toys & I love the shelf on top for soap bottles. But like the other reviews said it kept falling off the wall. So I used the holes on the mount that goes on the wall & put suction cups on it. Now it stays on the wall just fine. They should add those on to the design.
3,It's okay....,"My daughter wanted this for her baby so I bought it. It does make a handy place to put the bath toys so they can drain, and is much more sturdy than suction cup nets. We also had the problem of it falling off at first, but I just bought some 2-sided tape and put it back up and it has stayed so far. However, we don't put shampoo on top for fear of making it heavy enough to fall again.All in all, I guess it serves its purpose. I'm just not crazy about having a giant green frog on my shower wall.. LOL"
5,Great help for tubby time,My boys love this frog! My 3 year old loves to put his toys away! Great solution for the kids tubby toys and kids washing products. Highly recommend.
2,Same sticky tape problem,"I still think this thing is soooo cool, but... I followed the directions to the letter. Checked and double checked that I wasn't crossing any grout lines. (I'll admit I thought the others who said they'd had problems had not REALLY followed the directions like I would.) The bracket hung on the wall with nothing attached, but within 72 hours of hanging the frog and basket with foam letters, the entire household was awakened at 2 am as it crashed to the floor of the tub. So the stickie tape attachment gets a big fat zero. I like the concept so much I am debating on screwing it into the wall or finding a better adhesive at my local hardware store. (Hence the 2 stars) Currently it still holds toys while propped against the wall next to the tub. I attach the scoop after the water has drained."
2,Nice idea but good luck getting it to stay attached!,This thing was a waste of money. I could not get this thing to stay attached to my bathroom shower tile for anything. Cute frog but too heavy to stay up.
2,"Nice product, but weak tape renders it useless","It's cute, it scoops, rinses and drains bath toys. This should be a really useful organizer - but it keeps falling off the tub wall (in the middle of the night, too!)! I tried using 3M tapes - still falls off after a few hours. Suction cup would have been better. However, I really like this and was determined to make it work somehow, so we ended up tying the frog by both its index toes with rope and hanging it from the towel bar."
2,Its huge!,"Luckily we have space in our bath for this frog but it is HUGE. I was kind of shocked when it arrived. Also, its just a big piece of light plastic. Seems very over priced for the quality. I also ordered the suction cup bracket so we would not use the sticky tape and that worked great. I just wish that it came with some toys (for the price it should). Its just a hunk of plastic with nothing else. Not sure it I would have ordered it if I had the opportunity to see it in person."
5,Better than I had hoped,"I love this product! The convenient drainable scoop, and the shelf for bath supplies, combined with the cute design makes this one of my favorite shower gifts!"
1,Would Not Recommend to Anyone,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this item. I followed the directions word for word for installation via suction cups. The frog was attached to the base for somewhere between 5 to 10 minutes before it fell off onto my 6 month old daughter, who was in the tub. Luckily she was not hurt, just very scared. After this experience, while I understand that Boon will send me new suction cups, etc. if I request it, I don't want to risk traumatizing her again (although I'm sure it was more traumatic for me than it was for her, she got over it pretty quickly). I don't even want to give it to Goodwill for fear that it will fall on top of another baby. Nor do I want to drill simply to hang up a $[...] bath accessory. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone."
1,"Cute frog, but a no-stick here","This was given to us at our last baby's baby-shower. It was cute, but didn't stay up more than a week. Wasn't even that loaded. I wouldn't waste the money on it - I was surprised to see the price and would have never spent that much money on it. It now sits collecting dust, just waiting to be put in the recyling bin. On second thought maybe the scoop can be used in the baby pool???"
3,"Falls, but DARN CUTE","I have this wonderful froggy. I love him. My three year old loves him too because now he can pick up his own toys, and place them to drip dry into the tub. Well, I say now, but what I mean is previously!NOW THE THING SITS ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE AFTER FIVE MONTHS THE TAPE STOPPED HOLDING. Sometime in the middle of the night the thing came crashing down. A real disappointment. We followed the directions to the T.Perhaps I will follow the other reviewer's suggestion and try double sided tape, if that doesn't work I too will be returning the piece of junk.It's too bad that the tape stinks really! Because we loved our froggy.Mrs. Meg LoganMother of two."
1,Only buy if you have slick tile walls in your bathroom,I bought this because it was the only cute solution to storing my son's bath toys but I went through 2 back plates (with the stickers on them) and each time it fell off. I did everything that the instructions said but it never worked. I think it is due to the texture of the tile in my bathroom. I then bought the suction plate and it will only stick to the inside of the tube and not wall so it is not ideal. Once the tub fills with water the frog comes down. It is really a shame. The manufacturer needs to come up with a solution that will work for all tile types.
1,Does not stay,I bought this item in the hope that I would finnally have something to put my children's bath toys in. I tried using both the suction cups and the adheisive. I followed the directions and made sure to clean the area with alchohol and waited the recommended time for it to dry. With the suction cups as soon as I put the frog onto the holder it fell down. With the adheisive I had not even attached the frog pod itself to the wall attachment yet. I was still waiting the 24 hours for the adheisive to stick. But from one evening of everyone taking a shower/bath it fell down. Plus I was trying to attach the frog pod to the back of the bath as far away from the shower as possible. This product did not work for me at all. And I did not want to go so far as to put holes in my grout to use the screws. I wish it did stay because I have yet to find something to hold the bath toys.
1,Did not last long,"I loved this. I thought it was so cute and it worked really well for about 3 months.I followed the directions to the letter. As soon as it was exposed to repeated humidety it fell off the wall. The manufactuer said to screw it to the wall, but i really don't want to do that kind of damage to my tub. So my frog has been sitting in the garage since then. It's very cute and a very big waist of money."
2,Cute but not very functional,"I love the way this looks but it never worked for us. The sticky attachments it came with are not strong and it fell off our bathroom wall within the first day and it didn't even have toys in it yet. It's VERY difficult to attach the little container onto the base. The container holds only tiny bath toys and ones that are squishable. This thing has basically taken up precious space on my bathroom floor since we got it. I keep meaning to throw it out but never do, I wish there was a way to salvage it. ;-("
2,I finally got it to stick!,"i bought the frog pod because it is so cute. it stayed up for about two months, then crash! it sat on my bathroom floor for another two months because my daughter loves it. I got the suction cups- waste of money! I finally went to the hardware store and bought double sided tape for permanent outdoor fixtures. I followed the instructions and so far so good. It has been two months and we are still good. I finally even put toys in it."
4,More issues with the adhesive strips,"Like many other reviewers, I also had trouble getting this thing to stick to the wall. The suction cups didn't work at all, and it fell within a couple of hours when I used the adhesive strips, even though I followed the directions to the letter. Very disappointing. In the end, I used the suction cup attachment. I put a dab of rubber cement in the middle of each suction cup and stuck it firmly to the wall, then left if for a couple of days. That seems to have done the trick! It's a great space-saver if you can get it to stick."
3,Boon Frog Pod,"This looked like it would be great. The first time I actually saw one of these frog pods it was at a baby shower. I thought it was so cool. I read mixed reviews on this before I finally decided to buy it. When I followed the directions to the letter for the adhesive tape, left the adhesive pad (by itself - should hold up to 10 lbs. according to directions) stay on for over the 24 hour alloted time. Then I proceeded to put the frog pod on the attachment. It stated up for 12 hours without toys or anything else on it, before it came crashing to the tub floor. I then tried to restick it, but it would not work. I then tried to suction cup part. (should hold up to 5 lbs. according to directions) At first, the frog would fall sideways where toys could fall out. I kept trying, and I finally got it to work. The only thing I have in it is toys. (nothing else, no soap. etc) My child loves this, but she does not realize how much trouble this thing actually was. How everyone else has better luck."
4,Good for fun storage,"We recieved this, also brand new and it makes for excellent and fun looking storage for the bathroom. The only complaint we have is that the sticky pads used for adhering the pod to the wall only worked for 2 months, then it fell from the wall. After getting damp the adhesive no longer holds, so this is great for just a tub, but a bath/shower it is less than ideal, luckily, we were able to screw it into the wall."
2,"Great and adorable storage, but won't stick to the wall","I followed the attachement instructions EXACTLY and even waited the 24 hrs before hanging anything on the attachment piece before using. It worked great, for about 10 hrs. It lasted 2 showers and then came crashing down. Thank goodness no one was in the tub (especially kids) when it happened.Fortunately the attachment piece also has 2 screw holes and we will be able to attach it more permanently this way, but it needs to be done properly in order to avoid moisture problems with the screws and the holes created in the tiles in our bathroom."
2,So Cute... But So doesn't work,"I read other reviews about this product not sticking to the tile. I bought it because I thought that people just didn't put it on correctly. Well, I can tell you that I followed the directions to the T but four months later it fell off. I will try to get some more 3M tape (it came with four pieces) and reapply it but I just don't think it's going to work. It is a shame because I would give it 5 stars for being so cute and handy...but if it doesn't work, what's the point?"
4,Great bath storage,"I purchased this to help with keeping my 15 month old daughter's bath toys organized. I used to have the little mesh bag but it never stayed up. I was worried this wouldn't work. At first for the first few days the suction cups were not working. After using saliva on the cups I put it back up when the stall was dry again and it has not fallen since. It comes with the options to use double tape or to screw it into the shall, however the bathroom we are using is our master bath, so we plan to use one of those options when she is older."
4,Love it!!,I don't know why everyone is complaining that it won't stick... I have had no problems at all! Love it! Great for picking up toys in the tub quickly. I am only using the suction cups to stick it on the wall and have a large body wash and a shampoo plus a ton of toys on no problem and I just have plain tile. Maybe it has difficulty sticking on plastic liner walls but no problem here. I love this product! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because of the size... it is rather large overall but very cute and my son loves it!
3,Only stayed up for a couple of days!,"We received this frog as a gift and I loved it! I couldn't wait to get it up and get my son's toys out of the way. We made sure to put it up as directed and let it settle before using the tub/shower. It only stayed up for a couple of days and when it did fall, it scared the crap out of me!I still really liked it so we used it to store his toys next to the tub which was still in the way but worked.Finally, my husband was able to secure it to our shower by screwing it on. So, when we move, we'll either have to leave it or fix the holes but it is up and doing its job now."
2,Hate to be a broken record,"Yup, mine won't stick to the wall either. I don't have tile, I have a surround. We've tried other tapes and suction cups. I love the frog, but what's the use if it can't hang. Booo."
3,Cute toy holder but doesn't stick,"We love the look and quality of the frog, but it definitely doesn't stick. We don't have heavy toys in it, just some foam stacking blocks and letters, but the frog fell off the wall within a day of putting it up (in the middle of the night and it scared the day lights out of us!) We tried other double sided tape from Home Depot as other's have mentioned, but it did not help. We have large 6x6 tiles with a flat surface, so I don't know why it doesn't want to stay, but it doesn't. The only solution I can see is to either leave it in the bottom of the tub or drill holes in the tile to hang it up."
3,Too big,Great customer service and received the product on time......I love the product however it is just too big!!! I would love to see the product in a smaller size. Very cute though.
2,disappointing,"I bought this for my grandkids. We stuck it on the tub wall and in a month it fell down.So...we cleaned the wall and tried again...fell down.Took alcohol to clean the surface to make sure no soap,etc. Put lots of new sticky stuff on...still fell down.Now it is in a cabinet. It does not stick to the wall with bath toys...what a waste of money!"
5,Great product,"I love boon products and this is no exception, a great bath organizer and holds a lot of stuff. The frog is huge but it looks great in the bath and holds a lot of toys plus soaps and washcloths."
4,Holds lots!,So much bigger than I expected! Should be able to hold lots of toys... read the reviews and purchased 3m tabs to help support it -- will let you know how it holds up over time.
4,"The Sticky tape does not hold, but the suction cups do","We got this for xmas and we applied it exactly as we were supposed to with the adhesive and then after 1 month it fell down, luckily my daughter was not in the tub. Called the company and they sent me the new suction cup mount and instructions for the suction cup and for the screw in as well. I am surprised after 5 months that thing has not budged and can withstand extra pressure.I was prepared to use the screws if necessary, which I didn't. The screw in procedure is not as bad as I thought and could be filled in with basic tile caulk if you should ever remove it in the future. You do not screw into the tile, but in between the tile."
2,very sad to return this item,"This frog is adorable and I wish I had read the review about writing to the company for extra adhesive before I returned it. I followed the directions EXACTLY- cleaned area, dried thoroughly, used alcohol, waited a full 24 hours, did not cross the grout line etc. It fell down in the middle of the night and woke up my child. It went back to Target the next day! If you are willing to figure out a way to make this stick beyond the normal directions, it is a very cute bath accessory."
2,Would be perfect if it would stay up,"I bought this product despite the reviews saying it would not stay on for some. I thought they had perhaps not followed directions perfectly, and that it would stick on my wall. I, like others, read the directions twice, followed them to a T, did not put the rest of the pod on for MORE than 24 hours to make sure it was done curing, and it still fell off less than 12 hours later. I do not know if it is a manufacturing defect or if it only works on some tile and not others, but there needs to be an alternate method of hanging it. I am going to try to rig it without destroying it, and if I can't get it to stay put, I am returning it. Very sad because it is adorable and I was looking forward to using it."
2,works for some not for others...,I visited a friend that had the Frog Pod and it was attached just fine on her tile. I followed the instruction and it feel off the same night. Maybe it is the kind of tile? I am going to try the suction cups... if that doesn't work I will return it.
2,Fell down within a month - bad adhesive.,"My parents had a little turtle in their bathtub to keep the grandkid toys. I loved it, but when I saw this frog, I thought about how much it would be better. After purchasing it, I followed the instruction to mount it on a clean surface, let it sit for 24 hours before loading it, and only loading up to 10 lbs on it because we were using the adhesive version. I came home the other day and found the frog fallen into the tub. I am very disappointed that this product did not hold up to the standard I expected of it. Now I'm finding out that although the adhesive is not that expensive, the shipping is twice the cost! I do not live near a store to do in-house shopping. I have to rely on shipping. ACK! This does not bode well with me."
2,"Sad, sad little froggy","I desperately wanted the boon frog to work! I've given the boon frog as a shower gift and was convinced it was the best thing ever...until I received one as a gift and tried over and over to make it stick to the tile in my bathroom, to no avail. I bought the suction cup adapter and that stayed up for a few days but it fell down too. Now the sad frog sits next to our toilet unable to find work. While the boon frog is adorable (I gave it 2 stars because it's so cute!), it just didn't work for us. We ended up with a skip hop tubby that is awesome, although it gets mildewy and moldy if you don't wash it regularly."
1,DOES NOT STAY DONT WASTE MONEY,At first this did stick but after a couple weeks we had to re-stick. After it came crashing down in the middle of the night twice!(talk about waking up scared)we had to throw it out. This product fools you because like I said it did stick for a month but just would not stay. Big waste of money!
3,Fell of next day!!!!!,I thought this was really cute and clever. I followed the instructions to the letter and the stupid thing fell off. I have still not sought out a solution but I will probably try to buy some stronger 3m double sided tape.
1,very disappointed,I thought this was the cutest product and I was so excited to order it for my son. I followed all the directions and it fell off my tile wall within 30 minutes.
1,Not worth the Hassle,"This Frog pod was so cute and so practical for our small living space that we decided to get it for our baby daughter.. we followed the instructions perfectly, we have 4x4 tile, it wasn't stuck to a grout line, we left it to cure for longer and once the frog was in place we added a few items, very light items.. after a short while, maybe a few hours there was a loud crash.. we knew what it was, and I'm happy it didn't wake our baby!I can't even imagine what would have happened if this fell while she was having a bath!!! It's not worth our time to call the company and get replacement adhesives, we aren't drilling holes in our tile, it's going right back to the store!There's going to be a few dissapointed people during the holidays, that's for sure!"
2,"Very Cute, Won't Stick","As you've heard from numerous others, this thing doesn't stick. Our shower is completely smooth - I guess it's fiberglass. I followed the instructions exactly. About 12 hours after putting the frog pod up, it crashed down. Nobody had bathed or showered in there in that time - it just worked itself loose. All it had in it was one bottle of shampoo.I'm going to try to find the Command high-humidity strips like another reviewer suggested and will update here if they work.The frog pod itself is very cute and seems to be high quality. But if it won't stay up, that's not good for much."
3,Great until it falls off the wall,"I love the Boon Frog Pod, in theory... love that the frog's back is detachable, and has great drainage. Design-wise, my only complaint is that it's pretty large, but that's not a big deal. My main complaint is that we followed the pre-install instructions to the letter, cleaning the shower wall (fiberglass, no seams/grout lines) as instructed, attached it with the suction cups - and a few weeks later, it fell off in the middle of the night, scaring us out of our sleep. We then attached it with the adhesive strips, again following instructions to the letter - a few months later, it fell off the wall (again in the middle of the night, scaring us to death!). I was about to throw it out when I read the review at the top re: 3M adhesive strips for high humidity areas. Think I'll give those a try before I give up on it completely."
1,Useless.,"Doesn't stick.It stuck for maybe a couple of weeks w/ the suction cups, then crash in the middle of the night. Tried the tape. Nope. Crash.Thankfully, I bought this on craigslist, and didn't spend much on it (new in box). We have a very clean, non-tiled surround, and it just won't work. Not happy."
3,Toy scoop,"As cute as these are, they do not stay on the wall. If you buy these, buy some of those foam blocks with the double sided tape because you will have to replace it a lot."
2,Same as other reviews,"Great at scooping up toys. Holds a lot of toys. Looks great. Falls off the wall at 2 am and wakes the baby up. The sticky on this thing is HORRIBLE. I guess you could go get gorilla glue and affix this thing to the tile permanently, but I'd rather have something that I order come complete instead of having to fix it when brand new."
2,This is HUGE,"While a great product it is huge. To get it in our tub we would have to drill it in. This is not feasible. Super cute and great idea, would be better if they shrunk it down a bit"
1,CRASH in the night!,"We bought this frog pod and put it in our little girl's bathroom. About 4 months later at 2 in the morning, my husband and I were jolted by a loud crash. We looked all over the house looking for the source of the noise. It wasn't until the next morning that I realized that it was the frog pod that fell off the wall (the sticky tape stopped working I guess). This product is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money."
3,Did not stick as well,As been stated by previous reviewers I had problems with getting the frog to stick. We did not have anything heavy in it and it would fall down in the middle of the night.
3,Not for Italian tile or similar surfaces...,"It's very stylish and modern. Although it didn't stick to our Italian tile shower wall. The only solution to that problem would be to use the attachment for screws (but who would want to drill holes in their shower wall??) or use waterproof superglue -- and that's exactly what I did. Only you have to get the type of glue that is waterproof and the stronger the glue -- the better. Another thing is that the container for toys doesn't really hold all that much and the whole thing is pretty large in size, but it's mostly the base of it (the actual frog) that's taking up all the room...so pretty much it's just for ""looks"" if you know what I mean."
5,Great Toy Holder!,"My son loves this and at the end of bathtime, it is great to be able to put all of the toys in there and allow them to drain before you hang it back on the wall. Great product!!"
2,Doesn't stick - Careful if you have small tiles,"We got this as a gift, but I would not buy one for myself. Its great idea - the scoop is wonderful for snagging all the toys at once. Except we can not get it to stick to the tub. When it falls off - inevitably in the middle of the night - it wakes everyone up with a very loud crash.The suction cup version worked ok, but does ultimately fall off (like, after a week). Double sided tape worked better for longer (a few months), but we have small tiles and as a result, that ultimately came off too. Second round on the tape and same story. After crash number three, we had enough ""nightmare noise wakeups"" and gave up. We now use the scoop as a scoop, but keep the toys in a a mesh bag instead that hangs over the side of the tub.That said, we get some use out of it, so its not a total loss. Still, not worth $20+."
5,Fantastic Bath Toy!,I gave the Frog Pond to a friend who has twin girls. She felt it was the best thing ever invented for the bathtub! It is child attractive (prmotes kids to put their toys away) and easily hangs out of the way to let the water drain.
2,Sticking issue,"I too had problems with the frog. I followed the directions exactly for using the stick tape but it fell off a few weeks later scaring the pants off all of us. It seems random as to who this product sticks for and who it doesn't, I wonder if it has something to do with the relative humidity where you live? We live in FL and we put it up in August, who knows. Anyway, it seems to be a gamble if this product will work for you or not."
2,If it won't stick it doesn't matter how cute it is!,Same problem as many others have noted - we hung it up and it stuck for a few days maybe even a week or more. At some hour in the middle of the night it came crashing down and woke us all. Since then I have tried to reinstall it and each time it falls. I am only willing to go through so much for a product that costs $25. It is more trouble than it is worth. Go buy one of those less attractive nets that suction to the wall - they are less expensive and work!
2,Dont count ur chickens till they hatch,"Initially i loved the product. Was huge enuf to hold the biggest bottle of garnier conditioner bottle, shampoo bottles, loofahs etc.. But in a week or so, the sticker with which it was attached to the shower wall, came off and the whole thing crashed into the tub.. Now its jus sitting in the bathroom occupying the space n not of any use."
2,Didn't stay mounted for me either!,"We installed this toy holder and followed the instructions to the letter. It still fell off the wall. I could be a lot happier with it, to say the least! Its not doing much good sitting next to my toilet."
1,Does not stick!!,"I am always skeptical when buying anything that claims to stick to the bathroom wall but the frog pod was given to me as a gift so I figured I'd try it. I followed the directions exactly, put only a few things in it and it fell off three hours later!! The adhesive was not crossing any grout lines and it still fell off. I returned it the next day and got a simple net bag that has worked well--and was a lot cheaper! Don't waste your money!"
1,Cool but won't stay on the wall.,"This is a really cool thing for the kids' bathtub but I can't get it to stay on the wall. I tried the tape that came with it, I tried the suction cup attachment that the company sent (which reduces the weight capacity to 5lbs from 10lbs), I even tried automotive trim tape. It won't stay on the wall. I am not planning to use the last resort they suggest of bolting it to the wall. Maybe I can give it away as a gift or sell it on craigslist."
1,Fell off after one month,"I *LOVED* this product, until it fell off the wall after about a month. (I followed the instructions exactly). I will try using 3M double-sided adhesive strips to re-attach it."
1,Boring,Very boring book. All she talks about is a handful of clients that are as boring as she is. Save your money.
1,This is not what I wanted....,"I purchased this item based on the picture of the book. I thought I was getting ""A CHOIR OF LITTLE ANGELS"" what i got was not what is portrayed in the picture. I am very disappointed. A note in your description stating that the picture was incorrect would have helped draw attention to the fact that this was not the item pictured. I assumed the book was a variety of things, including cross stitch and crochet."
5,very helpful,thank you for the fast service this book is wonderful and very helpful to men who lose their Father hope you are encouraged to purchase and read this
2,A good effort,"Having read Alexandre Dumas Sr.'s entire Muskateer saga (including the lesser-known Louis and Vicomte books), I was interested in reading this entry from his son. I bought a 1984 edition (at a garage sale) that tied in with a TV-movie starring a young Colin Firth, and the book was enhanced with the inclusion of pictures from the movie, a Greta Garbo version, and two silent movie versions. It also shows one major difference between those movies and the book, but I won't spoil it. The book itself is lacking a bit. It feels too short and too shallow. The main character is all too willing to believe that his sweetheart is cheating on him if she won't meet with him, making it hard to like him. On the plus side, the author tries to show more depths to the much-villified career of prostitution. I'm not sure if I would recommend the novel, but it was an interesting read."
5,A True PAGE TURNER,"The book definately left me LONGING for more!! I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next to the characters. I am the mother of 2 young children and I don't have a lot of time for leisure reading. I found it hard to put down, I was reading every free moment I could find. It's a heartfelt story that will make you laugh as well as cry. I am eagerly awaiting the sequel. Toy Styles tells a great story and leaves you wanting more."
1,I'm Sorry but I have to be honest...,"Rainbow Heart is horrible, I'm not sure what everyone else read but what i read made my head hurt. The way the novel is written is atrocious, the grammar made me want to pull my hair out. There is little to no transition used, its choppy and has no flow to it what so ever. It wasn't possible for me to connect with any of the characters because of how underdeveloped they where. The entire book comes off like a creative writing project of a 9th grader. I'm sorry I've never ever found the need to write a negative review before but this book blew me. I literally had to force myself to read it, it took me over 2 weeks because I hated it so much. If you can get pass the English and the lack of development the plot is decent but thats the only positive I can give."
1,Junk,"It's a poor design that makes it difficult to use. For example, at the end of a movie - want to go to the menu and watch the special features? Be sure to hit DVD then Menu - and while it's flashing you can operate the menu buttons. However, it may also decide that by Menu you mean play. So it's troublesome on that end.And then the back popped off, so the batteries tended to fall out. Then it just stopped working all together. We bought this remote a few months ago.I picked it out because we just needed something for a TV, DVD/VCR, Video Game setup. Something simple. This was just cheap.DO NOT BUY!"
1,Avoid if you want the quality that is suggested,"I picked up this remote because it was $8, looked nice compact and perfect for my new Sylvania LC225Sl9 Lcd TV that came with an awful remote. Says, ""Guaranteed to work with all brands"" right on the package, I tried all codes listed, both forms of brute force code searching built into the remote and no luck to even control the power. The easy interactive code finder located at [....] is a JOKE, because after redirecting you to another site that sight redirects to the ""codefinder"" that is non-existant to Firefox 3 and IE 7 (I tried IE just incase my security was to high on firefox). I plan on trying to call RCA if I ever find a number which isn't in the package because I really don't feel like making another trip to the store to return it. I will let the 1star rating slide because with the brand code search feature it took 30 seconds to program it to a 6yr old JVC."
5,Item does not match to photo showing.,"Item photo was 2010 - present model.Item receive was 2006 - 2009 model.Most of all, this shoe is nice!"
3,Handles flex a bit when cutting thick branches.,"Yes... it's powerful. Yes, it cuts big stuff. The handles seem to flex sideways when pushing it to the limit... so I just won't push it. They seemed to flex more when you extend them out all the say. Leaving them in a bit will help stiffen the handles although you're losing some leverage. The ratcheting method is very different than my other ratcheting lopper. It'll take a while to get used to using it quickly. The cut is clean though."
4,Replacement Blades??,Excellent pruner and cuts very thick limbs. I am trying to find a replacement blade for mine as my son broke the blade in a 3inch tree limb. The blades that I have found for this are $30 and a new set of lopers can purchased for $50-$60. Any good resources for this would be appreciated!Trail Blazer TBL-24JRA 3-Inch Jumbo Anvil Ratchet Lopper with Telescopic Handle
5,trail blazer,this is a good product I use mine to help clear a lot of small trees so mucher easer than uaing a chain saw for the little ones and I can use them by my self I dont kneed a lot of strength I am 68 and 5-2 so belive me it does the work not me
5,Wonderful Lopper,"Purchased this Trail Blazer ratchet lopper for pruning back manzanita on the property. This lopper can cut easily through 1-2 inch diameter branches with ease. Probably would do 3 inch as advertised however for the thicker branches I would opt for the ole chain saw for speed. Note I did not use the handles extended for cutting the 2 inch branches and could do so easily (I am not a big guy either). Well worth the $$s spent. To cut through the dead manzanita which is very hard wood and dulls a chain saw quickly did require extending the handles, but it did cut through."
5,TRAIL BLAZER ANVIL RATCHET,"This is a super 3 inch Anvil Ratchet Looper, ideal to cut small tree limbs. Easy to use, love it."
4,QUESTIONABLE CAPACITY,"DON'T BE MISLEAD BY THE 3"" CUT CAPACITY,2"" IS MUCH MORE REALISTIC.THAT'S THE NEGATIVE.THE EXTENDABLE HANDLES OPERATE SMOOTHLY.THE RATCHETING ACTION IS EFFORTLESS,THOUGH IT CAN SLOW YOU DOWN IF YOU HAVE ALOT TO CUT.THE CURVED,SERRATED JAW HELPS LOCK IN WHAT YOUR CUTTING.IT IS A LITTLE EXPENSIVE COMPARED TO OTHER LOPPERS ON THE MARKET.QUALITY LOOKS PRETTY GOOD."
3,Delicate but useful,"I've had these loppers for about a year now. They have a wide jaw and can ratchet through some fairly big limbs. However, they tend to bind, to jam in the open position, and the handles flex too much and can pull right off the blades, although they are easily reinserted.I do not regret the purchase, but these loppers need to be somewhat higher gauge. They are delicate for the force that you can apply."
4,Great product,"this is great if you are older or smaller and just don't have enough ""umph"" to get the job done. I don't need all the strenth of a ""body builder"" or a man to trim my limbs trimed now."
1,Tasted bad I had to throw it away,This stuff tasted bad. I had to toss it. It was to thick and I could not hide it in things.
5,P is For Peace Garden: Not Just For Children,"Having grown up in North Dakota then moved back in mid-life, I wondered what a book in a series of state alphabet books would do with my memories. I was delighted. It invokes everything from the beautiful state flower, the prairie rose, to our bison, badlands, and of course, the International Peace Garden, with its chapel, the only building that straddles an international border. The illustrations are stunning, and the rhymes will be fun for kids, and not too silly for adults. This one's a keeper. Buy two, give one away, and keep one for yourself!"
1,Major disappointment,"I couldn't send this item back quickly enough. I presumed by its price being 2 to 3 times that of other foot massagers, that it would be an effective, high quality item. NEVER PRESUME!With a low powered hair dryer mounted in the middle, it sounds like a small aircract while the base vibrates uncontrolably. I'd say about twice as much energy was disbursed out the feet of the unit to my hardwood floor than to my feet.I'm not someone with unreasonable expectactions as many of the reviewers I've read seem to have. This is just an unusable product. The materials look cheaper in person, it offers virtually no ""massage"" to the foot, and it is incredibly loud. There is no redeeming quality to this item.Before I bought it, I looked all over the web for a review, unable to find one. Hopefully I can save someone else the disappointment. Did I mention I hated it?"
4,Almost Human Touch Massage,"Although it took a bit to get use to the massager, it does do a great treatment on your feet. The only thing this product really needs is to have an adjustable massage intensity. I bought this product as a gift for someone recovering from foot surgery. Even though it has been a year since the surgey the intensity of the massage is to great for the foot that was operated on."
4,Relaxing and invigerating,"I really love this thing. The only reason that I did not rate all 5 stars is because when I use the heat option, it becomes a little louder. Other than that, I am able to massage my feet for as long as I want to while watching t.v. without turning the volume up. The heat level is just fine, it takes a bit to warm up but never gets too hot. I wanted a nice foot massager that was not too loud or clumsy, and I have found it in this one."
3,"ok book for flipping through, too basic",Not a lot of explanation with the different PSG. Can easily go through it in a day. Definitely could be less expensive.
2,Disappointed,"I am a long-time fan of the Robert B. Parker SPENSER books, but was disappointed in the movie's presentation of CEREMONY. It just seemed too clean and slick: a tv movie, where I was expecting film noir."
1,What a Dud,"This book is one of the most disappointing books I have read in that I thought it had such promise. I read the other reviews prior to getting this book and thought that it would be a good choice. It wasn't. If you have read previous Harry James Denton books you might enjoy it, but if you haven't like me you won't find enough of a story to be worth reading the whole book. I felt the book started well, but it took forever to get to the mystery itself. There were about a hundred pages left in the book, when it got past the point where the description on the back of the paperback copy described. That in of itself tells you that there was so little for even the publishers to even tell you about the book. From reading the other peoples reviews Steven Womack has probably written some pretty good mysteries. The unfortunate thing is I won't bother giving another book of his a try, because I feel I wasted my time. Don't waste yours either."
5,Clear and profound,"Shinzen's work puts a scientific description on emotions that makes them easier to work with. The meditations break down what we call emotions into sensations and thoughts, and as such, they can be held with mindfulness. It is never easy to work with difficult emotions, but this work of Shinzen Young makes it possible to go very deep by identifying the sensations in the body and the thoughts about them. Then maybe, both can be understood and transformed into positive feelings. I listen to it every day."
5,Amazing,"This reader was highly impressed and delighted to discover such a gem. For most of us this is a very different world, different culture, and the author brings us into it so well that it isn't long before it feels familiar. The reviewer at Publishers Weekly is wrong. The tension exists throughout, but it is subtle, very cleverly done and perhaps not sufficient for those who prefer thrillers, but this is not a thriller. The homicides occur before the story begins and Kate is not in NY or LA but the Alaskan wilderness. In my view, this is perfectly done."
3,Good for getting an idea what Alaska life entails.,Just felt the book was a bit wordy and not easy to read. Story line was okay and did give you an idea what life in the back country of Alaska might entail..
2,Not worth it,What an ordinary story. Poorly written and lacking any form of suspense. There are much better stories out there that will entertain.
2,Didn't read it all,The story goes on and on about a lot of things not pertaining to the story.. Way to much background that goes on for to many pages. I never read it all as it just lost my interest.
4,Great adventure,"This was a very well-done story, I enjoyed the mystery, location information, and intrigue - can't wait to find another one!"
5,Love this author,I stumbled across this author over Christmas vacation. I have read four of her Kate Shugak books and love them all. Great series. Great characters.
3,A cold day for murder,This is the first book I have read by Dana Stabenow. It was an easy read but not too sure I will read another of hers.
3,A Cold Day for Murder,"This book was okay, but it didn't hold my attention. It took me a couple of weeks to finish, which is unusual for me."
3,True wilderness survival,Some detail was not realistic. You do not go into the bush with dress shoes on for example. Some exploits were not realistic. However enough there to maintine interest
2,Not my cup of tea,"My second book by this author, still not into her style. She doesn't really write badly it's just more about Alaska but not so much a mystery or a romance. If I wanted to know about Alaska I'd get the information some way other than reading a fictional book."
4,Good read,"Interesting main character (and the supporting characters, too). Perhaps I'm biased, being from Alaska, myself, but I really liked the story, it drew me in from the first page. No fluff, didn't have to skim read through endless descriptions of non-story related stuff, the story moves along quite nicely, and the plot, while not super complicated, had enough suspense to keep me reading to the last page."
4,Katerate,This thriller was a good read! This was written about an area that I was not at all familiar with but the author clearly brought the settings to life with her descriptive terms. I highly recommend this one and have ordered some of her other works as well.
5,unique hero,"Stabenow has created a unique hero in her female protagonist. Shown from a unique perspective in a facinating and compeling environment, Alaska as I have never imagined it. Love the whole series. She and her character are not afraid to take drastic risks!"
4,A Cold Day,A good read. This is the first book by Dana Stabenow I have read and I look forward to reading more of her work.
4,Good introduction to Kate and Alaska,"I will admit I got this e-book because it was free, but I have since bought more of the books in the series and really enjoy Kate. The first book is only an introduction to the interesting world of Kate Shugak and I was intrigued with her from the first chapter. If you like strong, smart women, interesting characters and a bit of rugged outdoors, you'll enjoy this series. Each book has been better than the last!"
4,A view to the outback of Alaska,"I enjoyed the plot and the main character, the ending was a big surprise and I'm not easy to surprise. Also the depiction of the culture was very interesting. Well written and certainly an enjoyable use of time."
4,A Cold Day For Murder,It has alot of the alaskan flavor in the story It kept shifting the suspect and kept you guessing until near the end.
2,A Cold Day FOr Murder,"This is a good read, not exeptional but interesting. It could use more adventure and suspense. Not at the top of my list for more reads by this author."
2,a cold day for murder,I felt it spent too much time telling about the area instead of the story. It was also difficult to follow at times. I felt it was kinda a let down.
4,A cold day for murder,A cold day for murder was set in Alaska and was an interesting ebook. I learned things about Alaska that I didn't know. Very good book.
4,A Cold Day for Murder,I love this tough female investigator and enjoy the descriptions of life in Alaska.Kindle has allowed me to enjoy reading again. Thank you!
1,couldn't get past 30%..,If this author spent less time describing every snow flake in Alaska & more time on the story I might have made it past 30%. Moving on...
4,Strong character!,I enjoyed this book. I will probably buy more in the series. I liked the strength of the lead character and found the mystery compelling.
2,BORING AS A SNOWDRIFT,THE MAIN CHARACTER WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO LIKE OR REALLY HAVE ANY FEELINGS FOR THERE WERE WAY TOO MANY DETAILS ABOUT ALASKA THAT HAD NO RELATION TO THE STORY THIS WAS NOT A LONG BOOK AND MORE THAN HALF WAS IRRELEVANT TO THE STORY
1,A Cold Day for Murder (Kate Shugak #1),This was my first book I read by Dana Stabenow. The book needed more action. I found it hard to follow & a little boring.
4,an award winner,reading this mudermystery on a hot summer night was very refreshing. kate shugak is an excellent detective. dana stabenow has written an engrossing mystery. it is wonderful to red about smart alaskan women.sarah palin had me confused.
2,Finished it but not in a hurry to read her other books,"It was interesting but nothing I'd tell someone "" you have to read this!"". I did download another of her free books, but it's way down on my reading list."
2,"Discontinued about 40% - no action, just blather","As is the case with too many authors, there is a critical lack of editing. Do we really need the endless droning discussions and introspection? There actually may be a good story in here somewhere, buried beneath the dross. I'll wait for the Readers Digest condensed edition, thank you."
4,A cozy,An evening's read that you won't figure out. Will go well with a cup of coffee or an adult beverage.
4,Good Book,"Fast moving book with a good plot. I love the descriptions of Alaska countryside, transportation, and the people. You can imagine yourself there."
4,Clever read,Dana Stabenow develops both an intriguing plot and interesting characters in this story introducing Kate. The park comes to life in a delightful read.
4,"For a first novel, I'm impressed.","The characterizations were memorable, the scenes deftly painted, and the plot interesting enough to keep me going. A couple of phrases from my generation made me smile. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because, to me, the story ended rather abruptly. It may have meant that I simply didn't want it to end. You decide."
1,Not worth the money or the time,"Filled with language, depends on that and other stale platitudes to fill between the covers. Sorry not my cup of tea!"
3,"Different, but average","Good for a quick read. It takes a different perspective to read this book. The lifestyle of the frozen north and the natives that founded it are very different than your usually murder mystery. Especially when you enter in the ""Outsiders"" characters. The deep family ties in this book are admirable at best and quite easy to understand, but to the detriment of the story, makes it very predictable. I found this one to be fairly anti-climactic; but solid writing none-the-less. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. A nice step away from the big city investigators. It did not however suck me into a desire to continue reading the other books of the series."
2,Skip it,"I really expected to like this book. I love mystery/thrillers. I love books and movies about really cold weather places - like Alaska. But I just could not get into this book. I gave up at 35%, which I thought was a fair attempt. The author spent so much time providing details of unimportant things - like very detailed descriptions of how a bar looked, or what someone was wearing, that I could not pay attention. There seemed to be no actual story during that 35%. I would skip this book."
2,well. I don't want my money back.,"I got the free kindle version, so I paid the right price for it. All in all, it's... an OK book. it's good for a little less than a week's worth of reading. and if you can get past the super detailed technical descriptions that don't really help to move the story or sometimes manage to be not quite right, you'll probably enjoy it."
4,A Cold Day for Murder,I chose this rating a good.I liked the story a good mystery.I will refer this book to friends.
3,A good read,"This book was interesting but very hard to read because of the number of characters. The beginning was good, and the ending was great. This author showed how hard it is for different cultures to fit together. The common goal or good has to transcend cultural differences."
4,A Cold Day for Murder,Enjoyed the book very much. Good detail about the area where story took place. Figured out the ending before I actually finished the book.
2,A little too much raw Alaska for me,"If you enjoyed watching Sarah Palin go hunting then Dana Stabenow's writing will suit you. Me, I'll pass after one. The story line was not good enough to out way the elaborate animal abuse and killing or me, but to each their own."
3,just an okay book,"It was hard to get interested and follow at first. There was too much descriptive dialogue. We actually replaced it with another for part of our trip, but then we started again and it was actually pretty good after it held your interest; about 1/2 way through."
3,Pleasant but flawed,"This is the first book in the Kate Shugak series. I didn't find it enthralling at all, and almost every single character described seemed to have been given quirks just to make them quirky characters, and yet I didn't really feel much personality from most of them.It started off with promise -- I could feel the love of Alaska and its natural beauty in the first pages, and I was interested in who this woman, Kate Shugak, was and how she came to be living where she did and what had shaped her. I found my interest waned quickly, however, and the plot was fairly thin.Since this is an early book of the author's -- around 1992 -- I might give some of her later books a read. If you've already read some of her later Kate Shugak novels, you might want to go back and read this one to see where she started, and you'd likely enjoy it because you already know some of the characters. I could have passed on this one, myself, though."
1,A Cold Day For Murder,"This was one of those books that I kept waiting for something GREAT to happen and it never did. I was very disappointed in this book and would not recommend it to anyone. This book was work to read. The main character is an Aleut living in Alaska and the cultural differences between their culture and much of the US were so different, yet not explained. I felt like I spent most of my time figuring out who was who and where they were, etc. rather than concentrating on the actual plot of the book."
1,A Cold Day For Murder,"I ordered the book. I downloaded the book, but it never got to my Kindle. I can't write a review. There is no contact info on this site"
3,Great descriptions and lyrical writing,"It took me a while to get into this book and although the descriptions were beautiful and flowing and possibly award-winning, they just went on and on and on and I had to really focus. Pity because it's a great story.I had no problem with the profanity as IMO it was in keeping with both her character and the story. So, I didnt agree with the mean and nasty Sirreadsalot who in my opinion needs a good 8 hours sleep to erode the spite in her. (lol)"
4,A cold day for murder,Loved .. Kate was the kind of character I like to follow. Held my ATTENTION and the murderer was a surprise.. just as it should be!
3,Hard to read,"I got this book because it had 4 stars and because it was a mystery. I found however, that the f word is in it quite frequently. I wish that it would be stated in the description about the books on here. I would get as many because I don't like the f word at anytime, anywhere.I also had a hard time reading it. I just couldn't get into the story. I think that the author went into too much detail on many things. I did fall in love with Mutt though, she was the best character in the book.I read the whole book because I hate to give up on one. I can only give this book 3 stars."
4,beautifully descriptive,"I liked this book over all. It is basically well written and descriptive of both scene and character. However, I personally could have done without some of the gratuitous language."
3,Intrigue abounds,For such a tiny lady she packs a lot of influence.Stabenow keeps you on your toes trying to guess where she will go next with her investigation.
5,Fantastic book,The author brought to life the Alaskan way of life and really put me in the scene. I love her interraction with her dog Mutt. I immediately bought the next book and now I want them all. Definitely recommend this book and all of her other books too
3,Mix of Stereotype and Realism,"Suspense mystery--1st in the Kate Shugak series. Kate is a native Aleut living in Alaska. I had read book 9 in this series years ago, and when I saw that #1 was a freebie Kindle offer, I downloaded it. In this story, a park ranger (son of a senator) goes missing as does the DA investigator who is sent to find him. Kate is called to find them because of her knowledge of the Park and her relationships with the native population. The story and mystery were good. Some of the characters were Alaskan caricatures, others were not painted in a positive light. Mix of reality and stereotype. But I enjoyed the book, especially the descriptions. Kate is a strong, independent woman with her own backstory. Her interaction with love interest DA Head, Jack Morgan, is interesting."
4,Good read,Enjoyed the descriptions. actually felt like I was in Alaska. would recommend to all who like a mystery and suspense
3,Slow Paced but Still An Ok Read,"This was an OK read, I found it very slow paced. I thought the plot was very good and the ending was a surprise. I could have done without so much profanity. The descriptions of Alaskan culture and wildlife made for a very interesting and informative read. Just these alone would make we want to visit Alaska. I would recommend it as a book to read."
4,A good read....,"A promising start to the series. I have ordered the next book, and am looking forward to reading it."
3,Disappointed,"I was very excited to get this book. I had seen the series, but it is so hard to get ahold of the earlier books. When I saw this first book for sale without having to pay the extra shipping for a used book I was very happy. Maybe I spent too much time looking forward to it. I didn't really bond to the lead character. The past was more a more interesting story to me then what was taking place. I didn't grow to care about Anna enough to make the extra effort, and cost, to buy the next books."
4,A cold day for murder,Short story murder mystery books are awesome. I enjoyed this author and will continue to read more of her books. A cold day for murder
3,Good read if its at a low price.,"I didn't not like the book, it just didn't grab me much. I got it on the kindle deals and am glad that is all I paid and not the full price for it. It has a good story- good characters- just nothing jumped out at me. I might try the next one in the series and see if I feel any different."
4,An easy read,Good for an time out. Not to fast moving as to confuse but not slow and over wooded. It also takes place in a newer venue. Let's you explore wilderness life from the comfort of home. Leave the desire to go back for more.
3,Good story,Enjoyed the story. I will definitely read another KAte mystery. She is strong character and easy to likeReady for the next one
2,I did not care for this book.,"I didn't finish it. If I am not engrossed in a book by the fifth chapter, I won't read it. The characters didn't hold my attention. What should have been an exciting mystery was boring to the point of exhausting. The only thing I liked about the book was the descriptions of the scenery."
3,Rating,"Although kept you guessing on who the killer was, there was too much description which made the reading a little dull."
2,Skip this one,I kept reading this book way past when I lost interest hoping that it would get better. It did not. Too much time is spent on the Alaska surroundings. There are too many characters to keep track of. There is a very flimsy story line. The heroine is not very likeable (her back story seemed more interesting). I did not even finish the book.
2,Could definitely be bettetr,"A Cold Day for Murder, A Kate Shugak MysteryDana StabenowA fairly interesting mystery plot, but with a disappointing, rather unrealistic solution.There were several really good sections, but the book seemed disjointed.The main character was, in my estimation, way way overdone. No need for all that tough as nails stuff.Reading this novel did not at all tempt me to visit Alaska. I've been there and the state is fantastic. The setting was wasted in this story.I don't think I would read another Kate Shugak mystery; I might check out some other of Dana Stabenow's books."
3,It helps to know...,"I received a free copy of this book for review. This was decent. Not one I would have picked off the shelf for myself. The intrigue was there, but I had it figured out early on. I am sure the area of Alaska is quite breathtaking from the description of it, but some terms needed to be looked up to understand what the author was talking about. I don't need to all the details of the Artic Cat's ""top of the line"" snowmobile. With the ""440cc fan-cooled engine and 108 Comet over-drive clutch"" was a little too much info, I guess for someone who doesn't use a snowmobile. This is just one example of how things were a little too descriptive."
2,A Cold Day for facts,"If you have any knowledge of the geography or lifestyle of Alaska, this is the book for you, for laughs.The author takes great pains to create a background, including factoids and details that do not relate to the story, unfortunately they are incredibly wrong.She apparently has read a great deal about the state and then taken great liberty with the organization of the information.As a resident of the state of Alaska, the locale of the story, I found it incredubly distracting to be presented with such frequent misinformation. Perhaps there is a good story in here somewhere, I was prevented from enjoying it due to the poorly presented background.I hope her books in other locations are more accurate, for the sake of those who know the area."
1,Horrible!,"Worst book I've ever read, hate it with a passion. Was torture trying to finish this book, had to give up trying."
3,"Slow paced ""thriller""","This was an OK read, wasn't that ""thrilled"" by it and it was very slow paced. Overly descriptive about Alaska and the protagonist's family issues. Scale back on that and focus on the actual plot and it could have been much better.Technically a 2.5/5"
2,Audible wow & flutter,"Initially, I was impressed with the overall sound quality of this turntable. But then, the more I listened to it, the more I noticed the wow & flutter on most of my records (a slightly ""draggy"" sound quality - most notable on piano or acoustic music). My ear is quite critical of variations in speed and I couldn't listen to my records on this player without hearing it. However, most casual listeners may not notice this and, for them, this turntable might be a pretty good bargain. Keep in mind, though, that this is designed for DJ use and has the short, straight tonearm which is great for scratching - not so great for audiophile ears. For critical listening, turntables with an S-shaped tonearm are highly recommended. Bottom line, I returned my T-50X and will most likely get the Audio Technica AT-PL120."
5,Beautiful music to listen to while drinking tea!,"This music is about returning to the more simpler things of life, returning to Nature, and about tea (cha). If you enjoy drinking chinese tea (zhonggou cha), then you will also love this CD."
4,Easy and fun to read.,"I picked up this book on a whim at my favorite book store's bargain table for only a few dollars....and it was a first edition. I read the book very quickly. It was entertaining in all aspects. He does a good job in describing what is going through his mind during the tournament but it is not a how-to play poker book (fortunately). However, you can pick up some good tips.He also describes his life prior to making his name known in the world of poker and I found this to be the most interesting. He always had some type of bets going with his neighborhood friends, he had some hard knocks in sport betting and spells it all out clearly. It's a fun book that is truly rags to riches.What would you do immediately after winning millions? Ha Ha, he did exactly what I would've done."
3,an honest read,"Moneymaker doesn't try to come across as a brain, which is the big strength of this book. The narrative is interesting and fun (a lot like BIGGEST GAME or BIG YEAR), and he talks about key hands. There's not much strategy, but for pure ""you're sitting at the table"" voyeurism, this book delivers."
5,Prose to die for!,"If you read only one book this year, make sure it's Louise Shiver's lovely little book. Yes, it's out of print, but worth the effort to hunt for. There is a treasure awaiting whoever goes to the trouble. I heard Ms. Shivers read an excerpt from this book when it first came out, and the memory still brings up a sense of incredulity at the beauty of the language she used. I consider it among the top 3 favorite books I've ever read. Get it! Read it! Then read it again. . . . and again. . .!"
1,Yawn,"It was more interesting watching paint dry and grass grow. If you want good erotica, look elsewhere. This isn't it."
5,"A fun, quirky take-off the on Disney film","This is a very cute little book with a fun focus on the three good fairies. Artwork is bright and lively, using many colors from the rainbow, and some interesting pink and blue themes significant to Princess Aurora. No images of the prince. Here, Princess Aurora returns to the woodcutter's cottage for a visit to her fairy godmothers, who are more absent-minded than ever! Sweet drawings of the cottage both inside and out. Cute little story that must have come as an afterthought with the success of the film. This is the only version of this Sleeping Beauty storyline you will find."
5,Gal from North Dakota,I've been waiting for this to come out on CD since graduation from albums to 8 track to cassette to CD. This album was the start of my rock & roll days and still an all-time favorite. Gets the blood going for jitterbugging.
5,great boat,"Great boat for the price. Not the fastest boat in the water but very stable, durable, fun and convenient. The bottom is thick (which does add considerable weight) and extremely resistant to puncture. Its great to have a boat in the trunk where ever we go."
2,Suitable as a toy or a float for diving equipment,"Here's the problem with these inflateable canoe's kayak's: They don't have a keel. I.e. they sit so high out of the water that they don't track when you paddle them. This is an issue when you want to go any distance or when the wind comes up. On the other hand, if you have a quiet lake and want to anchor a float for the kids to swim out to, climb in and out of, play king-of-the-float games, this will do. Or if you are a diver and want to anchor a float to hold your stuff after you bring it back up, this boat will do. But otherwise its an expensive toy, not a boat.Advantage over a regular canoe, difficult to tip over. Even when full of water, it will float high.Disadvantage, you can't go anywhere. It's no better than an inner tube on a river. If the wind comes up, you will be downwind quickly. Frustrating to paddle."
4,Good,This is a nice Inflatable. It handles well in the river I tried it out in and the seats are comfortable. It has a thick bottom to protect from abrasions but it really contributes to its weight. It is a little heavy and mine did come with a small leak that I plan to fix but other than that it is a nice canoe.
3,Like coming back to my teen years.,"I could not believe this CD was so good, and game so much pleasure to hear and remember good times of my life. Each song has a meaning and a memory. If you know Lulu Santos and like his songs, you will love this one."
5,A front porch conversation on child rearing.,"I enjoyed this book immensely. It was like sitting on the front porch with one of your best friends and discussing child rearing. Jeanie speaks in a straight-from-the-heart manner. Her words are genuine. ""Life Teachings"" is a very personal approach to the upbringing of a child. Most importantly, this book honors children as important individuals and also gives practical advice for establishing a ""sturdy foundation"" upon which children can build their lives. Her thrust is that we must be purposeful and respectful in our dealings with children. I highly recommend this book to anyone who knows a child."
1,Don't buy this,"This is a horrible product for the price. The second time I used it the valve broke. I returned it to the store and they told me it was a manufactures defect. Since I bought it on sale, they wouldn't replace/fix it. The removable floor is just plain silly it's one more piece of equipment that has the potential to get misplaced.They claim it is a self-bailing boat, but I found that not to be the case, I usually just pulled over and flipped it over to dump the water.If you are looking for something on flat water like a lake this will work fine, but I still think it's an absurd price. If you are looking for something to take on a river or some place with a current or rapids DO NOT BUY this product, your money will be better spent on an NRS.Sevylor's quaility has gone way down. I would give it NO STARS, but the review doesn't allow for that. Having seen the boats my friends have gotten for the same amount of money, this is a complete rip off."
5,Good Quality Socks for a Great Price,"I am wearing the Casual Crew Solid socks for the first time today and I have to say they are well worth the money. I would categorize these socks as medium weight. I wear a size 10 shoe, and these socks fit fine. My latest pair of shoes are a little too big so I try to find socks that are slightly thick. The Casual Crew Solid socks are not as thick as some that I already have, but are defintely thicker than some of the thinner socks I own. These socks have a tendency to fall down and bunch around the ankle over a short amount of time. The top of the sock is not elastic, it is more like a tight weave. The length of the socks would most likely not go past your calf up to your knee. For the money, these are great."
2,Disappointed..,"Haven't worn product yet, but the quality of the socks was not what I expected. They look as if they will stretch out."
5,Great socks!,Ignore the person who gave them one star. These are great socks! High quality and you can't beat the price (under $8 for 7 pairs). I was shocked at how nice they were!
5,Great Moisturizer,I was using an alpha hydroxy product (that kept my skin clear and beautiful) for sensitive skin and it was discontinued. I tried products from other lines that broke my skin out with a rash and acne. I have been searching for a couple of years now and have finally found a decently price product that does not irritate my skin and break my skin out. My skin is gradually getting better every week and those little bumps under the skin from other harsh products are going away.
1,"Shipped by ""lasership"" Once again, never received item.",AMazon.com is getting in the habit of not using UPS or FedEx....they are using a highly unreliable shipping carrier called LASERSHIP. This is the 2nd item shipped to me by LaserShip that has never arrived...despite their tracking info telling me otherwise. They are a bunch of liars and amazon.com is losing many customers because of this.
4,crowd pleaser,"I haven't had much chance to have this on as anything other than background music but I've nejoyed all I've heard. Also, I dj at a bar in Buffalo and the crowd loves the ""Sister Twisted"" and ""A Donde Van Los Meurtos"" tracks."
1,"TRASH!, TRASH!, TRASH!","I hated these films, I saw them on the SiFi channel (now SyFy) and they were beyond horrid. They're about giant alligators that eat people. DON'T EVER pay more than $7.00 (with shipping) for the set. I paid a little over $10.00 for my set and it was way too much."
1,"Absymal, ludicrous, annoying, pitiful.","First off, it's Aaron Carter, so you know this will bite big time. But come on. Talk about unrealistic! Tell me, how is a little 11-year-old white boy gonna beat 7'1"" Shaq? (I mean, sure, Shaq can't free throw - or act - or sing - to save his life, but come on.) Well, today's your lucky day, because I'm gonna tell you: he wouldn't. Shaq would just step on him. That's it. But you probably knew that already.Avoid."

HE's so hot! I love thats how I beat SHAQ! I cant believe shaq actually would join in on this really awesome project! I cant wait till he releases more music and really becomes famous, its only a matter of time! I have to say that Aaron Carter must be one of the best musicians ever, aside from the Ying Yang Twins, check those gangster out also! And they aren't underage!!"
1,Touchez U Emotionally.,"Thankz fo' checkin' in doggz.""How I Beat Shaq"" by Aaron Carter iz da most inspirational song ever written.Listen to this song,ya heard me.Aaron Carter iz da bomb!!!!!Okay,here is the real review,this is one of the most stupidest songs that I have ever heard.I mean,who the heck would ever be emotionally touched by this song.Come on people,How I Beat Shaq is the most stupidest song ever.I can't wait for this teeny pop nonsense to end.By the way,if you really are emotionally touched by this song,check in with your doctor.Peace Out."
4,A great performance worth keeping,"I first heard this recording over 25 years ago and I haven't tired of it since. I feel that this recording reflects the opera's roots in Czech folklore better than the Makerras/Popp/Vienna Philharmonic production. Popp, known primarily for her roles singing light-lyric or coloratura roles, does not bring the depth that this opera requires. This recording, dating back to the early 70's, is not of the same technical quality of the Makerras one. But to my way of thinking, I'd rather hear a greater performance than a finer recording."
5,I was blown away by this book!,"After reading this book everything else seemed boring to me. If you don't have this book yet, get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"It truly is ""Beyond The Game......"" - +SargE+","A BOOK FOR YOU DOOM LOVERS AND EVEN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT EVEN HEARD OF THE GAME....AFTER YOU READ #1 YOU WILL HAVE TO READ #2,#3,#4.BUT BE READY ITS INTENSE....................... RATED = * * * * - SARGE"
4,Great Read!,"I love the book and cannot put it down. I bought the entire collection of the doom novel series; including the doom 3 novels. Not a big deal, but unfortunately the cover art is not the same as shown on the site. It is actually an updated picture of what looks like just a horned demon. similiar to the one grabbing the marines arm on the original cover art. Doom is an iconic story with loads of gore and demonic charachters. Loads of detail keeps the imagination going while reading the novel. Buy em and collect em....may be worth something one day."
5,An Awesome Story!,"I first bought this book about 4 or 5 years. I saw it and thought it might be worth the money. When I read it for the first time,I was amazed! This book is absolutely worth the money. It lets you feel like you side-by-side with Flynn Taggert(the main character in the story) as he fights his way through the nightmarish demons on Phobos and Demios in search of any survivors and a way out of the nightmare. I would recommend this book to any Sci-Fi/Adventure fan."
3,Knee Deep in the Fiction,"Well I bought this book a long, long time ago (lets see- about 4 years!) out of curiosity mostly. I am a huge fan of the computer game and the book was very interesting- well written, not Asimov but not the Sun newspaper either ;) I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in the game, or alternatively anyone looking for light, lesser well-known sci-fi books to read."
4,Fast paced corny action.,"1) Find a monster - Kill it.2) Find a door - Open it.3) Find a keycard - pick it up.4) Find the babe - Save her.5) Use keycard in door - Open door6) Find big boss bad guy - Kill him7) Do it all over again ;)Splash in a few funny comments and you have a great time waster, i laughed quite a bit and was overall happy with the novel. Although it wont be on any english teachers 'To read list'.Enjoy!"
2,You've got to be joking!,"I didn't like this book much, mainly because it's inaccurate. This book(and it's sequels) set the bad guys up as aliens. The whole synopsis of the games were that you were fighting Hellspawn! Not alien clone things created to scare us! When I started out, I was interested by the way the author had the monsters act i.e Imps with their flaming phlegm. But I disgrunteled about the time the Lost Souls were reveiled to be metal. This book does have a few redeeming qualities, like the decriptions of both the Marines thought process and their days in the barracks. I also thought the opening gabit with the priests was a nice touch. These factors do not save the book, however."
5,A great book!,This book was the best of the doom series. It takes place on phobos and deimos where Fly and Arlene are trapped in a battle against denomic forces. The story has humor and a good action packed storyline. Thats why I would give it five out of five.
2,science-fiction ????????,Do you want to read action and blood? Read this book. But dont give a penny if you want science-fiction
2,Uhh...,"When he saw that I had bought this book, my father, after a bout of forehead slapping, was making snide jokes about it's content.""He ran out from around a corner and shot a demon. He picked up health and shot another demon. He took three points of damage, switched to a shotgun and killed a demon.""Sadly, this is the basic premise of the novel.If you like stuff like this, stick to the Aliens novel series, at least it has some substance, however little."
4,the little book that could [it didnt have any rocks],The book was good but it needed a few rocks to spice up the story.The girl was naked in it and my mom took the book off me because of that and that ticked me off a bit.A few rocks here and there wouldnt go a miss because i like rocks with their lovely texture and smooth exterior.Anyway the book was prity good but lacked ROCKS!!
5,got violence? this book does...,"It starts as normal testing of the portal but soon becomes the nightmare of the century! Demons pour in through the portal and massacre every thing in sight. Then a marine ""Fly"" Taggart's team is sent in to inspect the strange happenings. The only one to survive the onslaught is Taggart as he fights his way through Hell's minions to escape. If you like DooM you'll love this book and its 3 sequels: Hell on Earth, Infernal Sky, and End Game. Demons Imps and zombies! Oh My!"
3,Not bad for a computer game book,"This novel is.. well... mostly awful, but in a way that really keeps you turning the pages (and chances are, if you're reading this to begin with, you aren't exactly expecting Shakespeare). Also, in fairness, for a book based upon a shoot'em up computer game, this pretty much delivers what it needs to. It's a low thought gorefest that actually manages to be pretty funny while it's at it. For most of the novel (barring the end), it also manages to stay pretty faithful to the boards/levels from the computer game. Pretty impressive, for the gamer type whose grading the author on such things. All in all.... a great novel to pick up for a long flight if you like a sci-fi shoot'em up. This book never takes itself seriously, and this is its saving grace. Easy to enjoy, light on the brain. Bon apetit."
3,Decent,"I enjoyed this book almost as much as I enjoy playing the video game. I did feel it tried a bit too much to include elements from the game, however, and that led to its being a little ridiculous and tedious. Let's face it, the video game does not have a very good narrative structure and it takes some doing to try to make a story from it. The authors didn't succeed as well as one could have, but with this book, they did okay. My gripe is yet to come in my reviews of the next two, however."
5,Man This Book Was Great.LOTS of ACTION.similar to the game,"Knee Deep In The Dead,? I think that it was a very cool book,thats why I give it FIVE STARS.It had ton after ton of action.I especially like it when Arlene faces her fear and kills her former lover turned zombie Pfc Dodd.But the best part is when they fight the steam-demon or (CYBERDEMON). Written by,Shane Buchanan,A DOOM FANATIC"
5,Truly a Fantastic Book!,"When I first bought this book, I didn't know what to expect.I thought it would be silly and have no point. That's not what kind of book this is. It spends alot of time with detail but it doesn't bore you with it. I'd have to say it was a awesome book! a must-buy!"
3,The Crucible,The Crucible is an intresting movie on the Salem Witchcraft Trials. Arthur Miller had the biggest decisions on what to put in the movie from the play. He then decided to make some of the scenes different. During the Salem Witchcraft Trials in the 1600s many women were accused of doing witchcraft. Abigail Williams was one of the main one accusing others in that era. Elizabeth Proctor was onr main woman that was accused in the witchcraft trials. Many people were hung because they didn't say that they weren't witches.
3,THE GREAT REVIEW!!,"I thought that The Crucible was great. Elizabeth Proctor(Joan Allen)was trying to protect John(Daniel Day-Lewis) because she didn't want anything to happen to him. This movie was a great historical reinactment. I've read a book about the Salem Witch trials. With Abigail Williams(Winona Ryder)and the other girls screaming in the courthouse, is what had happened in history. All of the facts in this movie, were from the real Salem Witch trials. Everything in this movie were historically correct."
3,THE GREAT REVIEW!!,"I thought that this movie was great. Elizabeth Protor(Joan Allen)was trying to protect John(Daniel Day-Lewis)because she didn't want anything to happen to him. This movie was a great historical reinactment. I've read a book about the Salem Witch trials. With Abigail Williams(Winona Ryder)and the other girls screaming in the courthouse, is what really happened in history. All of the facts inn this movie, were from the real Salem Witch trials. Everything in this movie was historically correct."
3,crucible,"i thought that it was a alright movie. there was a bunch of hipucripes in the movie and a lot of people dided in the movie. i thought that the end of the movie was the good part because right before thay hung john he was saying a prayer. but before he finished the prayer thay kicked the bord out from under him and thay did not give him time to say amen which means so be it, also closeing. but i thought the movie was a alright movie."
2,The Crucible,"Many say that since Arthur Miller created the play and also the screen play, there is not much change between the play and the movie but since I only watched the movie, I wouldn't know the difference. I tried to get into the movie and although it was alright, I don't enjoy those kind of movies that well. Abigail Wiliams (Winona Ryder), was not one of my favorite characters. She and her friends accused many innocent girls for being witches. I lost interest in The Crucible afer Abigail tried to push herself up on John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis). Although I fell asleep I feel as I missed a lot of good infromation. When I woke, John Proctor was about to be executed along with two other women, accused to be witches. This was the climax of the movie for me because then, I wished I wouldv'e watched the entire movie."
2,"Well made film, Poor history","Miller goes astray with his own imagination. This is a good looking film with easy to look at talent all around. The story however is pure Hollywood BS. What happened was an incident of a African slave teaching some local girls about her native spiritual customs which included using an ergot style drug. The resultant hallucinations and behavior so scared the heavily oppressive church officials that they quickly condemned to girls to death as witches, using a kangaroo court to scare and intimidate the people from any further experimenting."
2,Curses!,This movie would have had a chance if wynona ryder wasn't in it. It still astonishes me how many movies she has starred in and she is one of the worst actresses and even more astounding she gets roles that require her to do an accent which is downright laughable hearing her poor abilities with them. The other actors however were quite authentic and passionate with their roles which saved my rating from being 1 star. The story of the movie is boring in itself but I understand it's based on a true story. It was a bit interesting to see the ignorance of those times.
3,Take away two stars for naked dancing,"You really dislike Winona Rider. Which you should. She plays a really wicked character. She dances naked in the beginning and you see her breast briefly. Not necessary. I would have liked my kids in upper grade school to watch it, but I won't let them now. My high school kids watched it. Again. Not necessary. Seeing her full-body naked dancing from behind was enough."
5,brilliant,This is an amazing movie... whoever plays john proctor is absolutely great... this movie had an emotional effect on me that no movie ever has.. thats all i can say
2,scratched DVD,"I bought a new DVD and there was a skip in it the first time I played it. Unfortunately, it was also in one of the most important scenes in the movie. I had already thrown the receipt (thinking if it was new, I had nothing to worry about). Bummer."
2,Okay,I thought that at he movie was okay. I've read the play and watched the movie and the are very similar to each other. I like the fact that in the movie Arthur Miller put the scene in when the girls were dancing in the woods and you can see everything that happened and who did what. The movie could have been better if he used more light and could see what was going on in the movie. I think that Daniel Day-Lewis did a good job acting his character John Proctor. All in all the movie was okay.
4,THIS ONE MR TIERNEY By: Jose Macias,"I thik that this is one of the greatest movies I have seen. But the only part that bothers me is that they dont use common scence.They say that if a cow dies they blame it on the first person they see acting strange. People back in the days were very strange.People in the pass were very religious, another thing that the people got acussed from was not going to church. What I thik of this story is that THE CRUCIBLE is a really important story,because it made think how people were in the past. this is why I think of THE CRUCIBLE."
4,The toxic power of lies,"Since playwright Arthur Miller used the Salem witch trials as a metaphor for the Communist witch hunts of the House Un-American Activities Committee, you might expect this film version of ""The Crucible"" to be too awash in symbolism to be entertaining, but it's fairly riveting throughout.Although it's primary concern is the toxic power of lies, it touches on the belief that the Puritans were convinced of the devil's presence.Winona Ryder is the protagonist, a girl whose love for a married man (Day-Lewis) leads her to implicate his wife (Allen) as a witch. Well-acted by a first-rate cast. Screenplay by Miller.Brian W. Fairbanks"
5,Excellent Adaptation Of The Pulitzer-Prize Winning Play. Star-Studded Cast & Written For The Screen By Arthur Miller Himself.,"Adapting his own Pulitzer-Prize winning play for the silver screen and enlisting a top-notch star-studded cast, Arthur Miller creates a cinematic masterpiece. Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis (Best Actorfor ""My Left Foot"") and Academy Award nominee Winona Ryder (""Bram Stoker's Dracula""; another excellent adaptation of the vampire novel penned in 1897) star in this classic film version, supported by Academy Award winner Paul Scofield (Best Actor for ""A Man For All Seasons"") and Academy Award nominee Joan Allen. Well worth viewing. Rated PG for brief nudity."
4,"""As good as it gets""",I think that Winona Ryder played an excelent role in this movie. I think that she is an awesome actress. She is one of my fovorites.
4,A good movie that makes me think,"Talk about paranoia, superstition, and hysteria! Wow! This movie makes me want to find out what really happened in Salem. Did the people really act so nervous about everything? Did they blame everything on the devil, like in the movie? This is a fascinating movie, which had good costumes, good sets, and great casting. It makes me want to do research into the Salem witch trials, so that I can learn what really happened. I recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to history buffs."
3,Good Film,"This is a good film production of Arthur Miller's play. Also, the film includes a scene that is usually left out of the play. I think it is from Act II. The set design, cinematography, and costumes are excellent. I would recommend this film!!"
4,The Crucible From Marlington HS,"The Crucible film gave good insight into the minds of the young Puritan girls. Hollywood did a good job projecting how hysteria can spread in a very small and ignorant town. The film also shows how the priest from out of town did very little to actually help the whole situation. Instead, Reverend Hale made the hysteria spread more rapidly, because he too, bought into the hysteria of the children."
5,This was a truely great movie.,"Abigail a young girl living is 17th century Salem, Mass, had an affair with John Proctor which ends when his wife found out. Abigail joins with several other young girlsin a meeting designed to bewitch the men whom they are interested in. The local minister stumbles on the nightime festivites. Now everyone seems to be screaming witch. One of the many issues about the witch hunt is that it repeats itself in various ways throughout history. This was a very good movie and play. I give it ***** Stars!"
3,The Crucible,"For the most part I liked The Crucible. It was interesting how there were mysterious parts not knowing what will happen next or what someone will do next. The acting in this movie was done well. Daniel Day Lewis played John Proctor well and he made you think what he would do next. Winona Ryder played Abigail Williams well, but I hated her as a person. She and her friends caused all those people to die for nothing, and she acted very childish. The director Nicholas Hytner choose good people to play the roles. The crucible was also educational. It gives you information on the events that happened in Salem when all the witch trials were going on. It gives you information on what was actually said in the trials. In conclusion The Crucible was a good movie that was played by good actors and directed well."
4,"A great companion for teachers of ""The Crucible""","While I don't recommend showing the film beginning to end in the classroom (too, too long) I found that my students enjoyed viewing specific scenes after we read them together in class. I do show the last 35 minutes of the film once we finish reading; the scene between Proctor and Elizabeth and the confession climax is a MUST-SEE! Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen are remarkable and Winona Ryder is scary convincing as an obsessive teenager."
5,Review of the Crucible,"The movie the Crucible was and interesting movie that I enjoyed. The movie relays many historical facts and in an intertaining way. Arthur Miller chose a great cast that made the movie very life like and emotional. To me the movie showed how life really was in the 1600's and how a group of girls couold cause such a large uproar. I think that the movie was an improvement of the play because there are scenes that take place outside, which gives the movie a more interesting affect. Overall I think the movie is great."
2,Lost Value,"The movie ""The Crucible"" is an inadequate portrayal of Arthur Miller's original script. The main idea and theme of the production was given across correctly. The severe test of the townspeople's souls was portrayed clearly, howerver the powerful dialogue was compromised in translation to the big screen. The basic plot of the movie revolves around the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. People of Salem are accused wrongly by a group of ""accusing girls"". As accusations grow so many innocent people are put through a test of faith and must either confess or be hanged. The story line is very worth while, but as I said before, it is portrayed in this movie very poorly. I would not recomend this movie to people who have seen the live theater production. For those that have not seen the production, it a movie with a good theme."
2,"Waste of Resources, Talent","Historical iaccuracies and inanities abound in this moribund tale. The truthful telling would have more than made Miller's ""witchhunt"" point without the needless and innacurate sexual intrigue. For Miller supposedly researching this tale with such diligence, it really is a mess."
2,"""Crucible""","The movie ""Crucible"" wasn't very good because there really wasn't any action in it. It didn't have any explosions. It didn't have any shooting. The movie wasn't good."
1,"The ""Crucible","The movie, ""The Crucible"", didn't interest me at all, but if your into withchcraft this is our flick. I didn't really understand the movie, it kind of went over my head. The evaluation of the movie was terrible, or I just didn't get it one. One good thing I can say about this movie is that the characters were pretty good."
1,ThE cRuCiBle,"I didn't really like the movie, because it was really boring.It would've been a lot better, if the movie was a little moreInteresting. It was an alright movie.The Crucible was a good movie to show to students. ToLearn about the Salem Witch Trials. But I wouldn't preferTo actually show the movie somewhere else. I'd reallyOnly use it for educational things."
1,"""The Review""","I dont really care for this story too much. It just baffles me how an entire village could be so ignorant and believe a bunch of silly girls' outrageous aqusations. So once everyone started yelling and screaming about some nonsense I just tuned them out and went to sleep. So I wouldnt be able to tell you what happened after that. I dont have anything else to say about the story ""The Crucible."""
5,The Crucible,"I personally LOVED this book. I thought it was great because of the way it was written. While you read you can feel the emotion inside you. Also, Arthur Miller did a great job on the character's personalities. I really disliked Abigail. That is really good for an author to be able to portray a personality to the reader. It was great and i liked the fact that Miller was actually comparing the witch trails to what was happenning with Joseph McCarthy in the 1950's. I thought it was a MUST READ book!!! END"
4,Well done,"I read the Crucible in 7th grade. It was my first classic piece of literature and left quite an impression on me. I had seen other movie/play versions, but this one really caught the mood of the times during the Salem witch hysteria and how unpredictable daily life was. Everyone's performances are well done, and the costumes, homes, down to the carpet on the table was incredibly accurate. I recently toured Salem, The Witch House, Pioneer Village, Plymouth Plantation, etc., and decided to watch this movie again to see how accurate it was in it's depiction. Very! The story is well done, heartbreaking and certainly a lesson for all time. This should be made available on DVD asap."
5,"So real, it is like you are there!","The acting and scenery is so real, it is like you were there to witness all that happened in 1692. You had to be taken in by what happened back then. Innocent people dieing by twisted laws. Every person gives an all out performance in The Crucible. This movie is worth owning and watching again and again."
2,Overwrought acting ruins it,"The Crucible is an important play and a very good one. But the self-important approach this film gives Miller's script is devastating. Primarily, the acting is so overwrought as to be nearly laughable. Only Joan Allen and Daniel Day-Lewis, two of the best actors in the business, remain unsullied. The rest not only chew the scenery, they regurgitate it. Try it and see -- everyone else in here seemed to enjoy it."
3,My Perspective-Trishtina Snyder,"""The Crucible overall had taken the facts based upon withcraft, and people being accused/prosecuted for practicing withchcraft very clear and understandable. Their were about an equal amount of strenghs and weaknesses.The author of ""The Crucible"" should have taken those events/facts involving the accusations and prosecutions of witchcraft and have added more action upon the scenes. Rather than just seeing people hung and by seeing a man crushed by stones. Maybe if they had created various punishments or go in depth more of the punishments. Make it more exciting with maybe some blood or something to where people will get into it more. It could have been more explicit in how they practicied witchcraft.It lacked drama and could of had more disaster or tragedy.Although I felt that the movie met the the turning point like all good movies do when Proctor declares himself innocent and knows that if he pleads innocent he will be hung but he still proceeds with being innocent."
5,It Is Now Available,"Forget what Amazon says-I bought this film almost two weeks ago. It has a featurette, audio commenntary by director/writer. It has a trailer and a conversation between star and writer.It's a great film. An important film. As always, Daniel Day Lewis and Winona Ryder are superb."
4,Weighted down with learning,"One of the better movie adaptations of a classic 50's play.With the deportation to Cuba of terrorist suspects, the USA like in thered hunting of the 50's has a witch hunt in the early 21st century.The difference between scholarly knowledge and real wisdom and understanding is pointed out by this theme. The Catch 22 effect of confessing to a liein order to save your life just makes one angry in watching this film at a systematic law that has no justice and real sense?The hero of the movie dies by hangingwhile reciting the Lord's prayer.The acting is very good and believable, but the script is expanded and the wording changed from the play.There are repeating themes in history andone of them is groundless persecution of minoritiesand those with different ideas or backgrounds from the ordinary."
5,Love It,This is a great movie. It is clean and very family friendly! I would recommend it to anyone.
5,My new favorite movie,Could this movie be any better? I loved every minute of this movie. How creative and fun and also heartfelt. I will definitely telling all my closest friends and family members to purchase this movie.
5,Great Indy Movie,I love this movie! It is a great family movie that is quirky and funny and has great music. This is a fantastic independent movie.
3,Decent Import Video-Great Japanese Segment,"Let's keep this short: Import videos aren't going to win awards for creativity, originality or even cinematography. What I look for is cool cars, decent footage of the cars in action (I hate videos of cars at car shows unless it's the Tokyo Auto Salon). This one delivers with good footage of the Toyo Supra in Canada and cool footage of the Top End NSX on the Wangan. Since I find drifting boring on video (but I love taking my kids to see it live), I usually skip a good portion of this DVD. And oh yeah...the Porsche 996 Turbo is cool, as these videos hardly ever feature Euros. So I would say in conclusion that this video, with the bonus features, has a good 40 minutes of content. Not bad for the prices they are going for here on Amazon! (I have owned these videos since their respective releases.)"
3,what I expected,"This is a older book , but very informative. This is exactly what I expected . The discription of the book was right on!"
4,Different Strange and Exactly what I need,"If there is a song describing my state of being right now(besides somebody to love by Queen, but that doesn't include Jesus in the picture so its incomplete) its Imagerical. I love everything on here and can definetely feel the ""Youth Group"" or college worship roots. My only problem is that while it is a different kind of music, sometimes the effects and sounds seem like disguised pop. Not that I mind, I love the lyrics, keyboard effects, and background vocals.So overall it is very nice.And his singing style? Unusual sure but hasn't anyone heard the lead singer of Jars of Clay sing? They sure sound similar sometimes...BUt all these criticisms are largely cosmetic and have more to do with the way the album was promoted.Its heart is in the right place.Check this out, buy it, love it.And use it to lift your heart towards God and worship with joy."
2,Disappointing !!!,"As what has already been mention in many of the other reviews of this bookI too was very disappointed when it arrived. I have several other books publishedby North Cape Publications that were nicely printed and bound on excellent paper,covers and great pictures some of which were written by Joe Poyer as well.However this particular book is pathetic. Printed on basically recycle trash paperPhoto's are Terrible, lots of in incorrect information in the book in regards to the rifle,I found many typo errors as well as many mis-directed notes to pictures through out the book.I'd pass on this book, as it is its not worth the asking price that its been selling for.It definitely lacking in many areas and is made up of poor, inferior materials....***"
1,Fiction - no research: Made up facts!!!,"What a waste of (cheap) paper and money... why publish a book if you are not going to do any research? Even the Belgian flag on the cover is pictured in the wrong direction (no it is not meant to be German)! This book gets a big ""F"", it is filled with errors and made-up facts. Maybe it is meant to be sold as fiction."
3,not enough listings,"The Rough Guide is an English language edition of the Rotard one published in France. As stated in the introduction, it specializes in presenting medium to small, independent, appealing, and affordable restaurants and hotels. It is comprehensive in that it covers all of France. However, it is less than comprehensive in its coverage of individual locales. For some towns that are well known destinations, barely one or more listings are sometimes given. These places must certainly have more choices that meet the criteria of the Rough Guide, and, in fact, by consulting other guidebooks I have found other choices that by their description ought to be in the Rough Guide."
3,Good try,"""Away From Her"" is a good, but not a great film. Julie Christie, as a woman stricken with Alzheimer's disease, and Gordon Pinsett, as the man seeing his beloved wife slipping away from him, give fine performances. But the movie itself is rather cold and aloof. As someone who cared for parents with this terrible disorder, I found that the pathos and heartbreak that comes when you watch your loved ones deteriorating was missing from the film. Perhaps the feelings are too deeply personal to be adequately expressed to others. If you haven't been there, you cannot possibly understand what it's like. The folks who made the film gave it a good shot, but ultimately came up short. It's worth watching, but don't expect any real insight into the nature of the disease or its effect on caregivers."
3,Away From Her,"It followed Alice Munro's short story ""The Bear Came Over the Mountain"" very well except for the ending. I think the movie's ending was not as plausable as Munro's short story. However, my wife and I watched the movie and were moved by it. It is thoughtfully done. And Julie Christy did not disappoint us."
1,TOTALLY UNREALISTIC,"One of the most disappointing overhyped films I've ever seen.To me, this movie was a comedy. I had to laugh at this lameportrayal of someone with Alzheimer's. (""It's time for me togo to the nursing home, darling."") Does anyone on this 4 starslist have a family member with Alzheimer's? A more realisticfilm is A Song for Martin - but even that only scrapes thesurface. Prepare yourself for one or all of the above in thereal world of Alzheimer's: violence, paranoia, total shutdown,hoarding, depression, delusions, bankruptcy, defecation on thefloor, someone who absolutely cannot utter a coherent sentence...I could go on & on. I wonder if any film could really dealwith it? Maybe a documentary."
2,Not Realistic,"This movie made me angry, because it makes Alzheimer's look so much more benign than it is. Most caregivers are forced to keep their Alzheimer's victim at home for much longer. And where are the rages, the suspicion, the accusations, the delusions, the paranoia, the halluciations, the catastrophic reactions, the hitting and screaming that a caregiver must suffer through? Where is the diaper changing? Where are the sleepless nights? To enter a facility like Fiona does, one must be exceedingly wealthy, even in Canada, I imagine. And why end the movie on a up-beat note - where she is remembering momentarily? It gives the impression that things will get better when they only get worse."
4,"Slow-moving, melancholy but good ...","This slow-paced and melancholy film traces the development of Alzheimer's on one woman and the seismic impact it has on her husband. The latter must eventually move his wife into a care facility, where she develops a strong attachment to another resident who seems even more worse off than her. Her husband's feelings of abandonment and jealousy give way to other impulses at the end. Julie Christie is magnificent in the central role of the woman with dementia.The film may idealize life in a care facility. Many reviewers have commented on this. Hollywood's version of these ""homes"" is much more plush than the reality.A good film about the power of love and relationships."
1,Preposterous,"I know I am in the minority here but I have been a caregiver for my wife who has had Alzheimer's disease for more than 6 years and so have firsthand experience with the ravages of the disease. This movie is unrealistic, absurd, and preposterous. It's difficult enough to get people to understand what Alzheimer's disease is like; a ridiculous film like this doesn't help and does a disservice to the victims of the disease and those who care for them. The film makers seem clueless about Alzheimer's disease--shame on them. Skip this film and instead watch ""A Song For Martin."""
3,'I never wear yellow',"""When I look away I forget what yellow means. But I can look again. Sometimes there's something delicious in oblivion.""Sarah Polley writes and directs a faithful adaptation of Alice Munro's short story ""The Bear Came Over the Mountain,"" adding some effective symbolic touches of her own. ""Nature never fools around just being decorative.""I doubt the film will help anyone dealing with Alzheimers, but I'd be happy to be wrong."
4,Beware if you're over 50!,"This is not your average feel-good movie. As his wife was fading into oblivion, Grant found that he had a good deal in common with Marion. As he realized that he lost his wife, he appeared to be able to keep on going, and to find another direction, while doing whatever he felt he could do to give his wife what little happiness he was able to dispense.Beware if you're over 50!"
4,away from her,"Great movie, If you watched Notebook you'll love this movie.It hit home as you start to think about where you are in your life today and the simple effects of life love love affairs with those closest to your heart."
4,Pleasant confusion,"I'm a Sales Manager at an Alzheimer's facility. This film is the most accurate depiction of this horrible disease I have seen yet. I work with heartbroken spouses everyday of my professional life---and watching this movie reminded me why I do what I do, and how much I love it.Granted Julie Christie is an awfully beautiful Alzheimers victim....as unfortunately the disease usually robs one's looks...or one's CONCERN with one's looks. But all-in-all....very accurate portrayal of the emotion, the heartbreak, and the way it wreaks havoc in human lives."
4,Beautiful film,Saw this gem the other day and to my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed it. The performances from Julie Christie and Gordon Pinset were heartfelt and the director never let things drift too far into rank sentimentalism. Tugged at the heartstrings without being manipulative.Loved it.
2,Preachy,"Normally I would consider giving this beautiful movie four of five stars. But this DVD comes with a prequel, in which the actors explain to the audience just what a terrible ordeal Alzheimer's is. I suppose that's to ensure that those of us who do not get the point of the movie will still get the message. If the filmmakers are going to use the DVD as a bully pulpit, should not the DVD be free?"
1,"I wanted to like this film, but...","...it just doesn't seem to be realistic or well written. The choppy sequencing does nothing to add to the story line, and, as another reviewer commented, none of the characters is very likeable. The portrayal of Alzheimer's Disease isn't very typical from my experience. Away From Her is one of those films that you begin watching, hoping a good story will develop...only to find out that you're still waiting for that story an hour into the movie. Overall, I would say this film would be a decent effort for a first-time filmmaker (which it is), but it's nothing near what an Oscar-nominated production should be."
4,TRAGIC STORY OF DEMENTIA AND UNCONDITIONAL LOVE!,"'Away From Her' is a film that really tore my heart out, due to having gone through dealing with Dementia first hand in my family. Besides some fine performances, this film offers inspiration and humor in all the right places. It's about as enjoyable as a film like this can be and the love story is truly special showing some of the most unselfish acts I've ever seen! This is worth seeing, but keep a few tissues handy. :-)"
3,"DVD.Julie Christy in ""AWAY FROM HER""","If you are a Julie Christy fan, you will enjoy this film.It could be a bit slow for most people.Congratulations JULIE CHRISTY."
4,"SARAH POLLEY, OPUS 1","**** 2006. Written for the screen and directed by Sarah Polley, this movie is an adaptation of Alice Munro'sAway from Her. Golden Globe earned by Julie Christie. After 44 years of marriage, Grant and Fiona are torn apart by Alzheimer's disease. If you liked this film, it could be a good idea for you to see Richard Eyre'sIris, another wonderful film about this terrible illness."
5,More Than Spectacular!!,"When I purchased this CD, I did not know what to expect (this is the first CD I purchased with only marches on it). But, I knew if it was from Reference Recordings, the sound would be spectacular! Spectacular marches from a spectacular bandmaster from a spectacular recording label equals something much more than spectacular, to say nothing of the spectacular performances of the Dallas Wind Symphony! To describe this HDCD as a toe-tapper is setting the bar far too low. Listening to just a few of these marches can change a gloomy day to sunny - and I mean it! These marches are impeccably played with such verve and gusto that you are transported right to Main Street USA. And all this marching emotion is captured as faithfully as possible by the ""Professor"" Keith O. Johnson of Reference Recordings.If this CD does not get your heart pumping, better call 911!A GREAT CD not to be missed!"
2,?,"Although I am a psych student with a pretty good GPA, I find this book difficult to understand. The difficulty seems to come from the authors' desire to condense as much information as possible in just a few hundred pages. This leads to a cryptic language, where some terms are defined only once and some sentences become a string of such words, a thing which ,personally, frustrated me."
2,Not recommended.,"This book is poorly written, and I found some parts to be repetitive. Although I normally do well in my undergraduate psychology classes, I found this book dreadful to read through, as the author doesn't write in a way that would make the concepts easier to understand. It's just not concise as the other psych books I've gone through. A dry read."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,This book is poorly written and the authors are rather disorganized. I'm a psychology major and I got this book for one of my upper level course. I totally feel like killing myself while reading the book!
3,Blah,There are those textbooks that actually keep your attention - this is not one of them. I get bored after about 2 pages and end up diverting my attention to something else. Not the best when you're trying to study!!!
3,Well researched but difficult to understand,I had to use this book for a class. It is packed with information but often it is difficult and frustrating (for me) to understand. Not for the layperson unless you are really into cog sci.
2,"Weak Story, Weak Prose","Effete little book with candied pseudo-Shakespearean prose. A real turn-off. If these had been Shakespeare's dying words, we're better off without him."
2,Shakespeare Light for the Shallow Reader,"Shakespeare's last book, that's what the author claims to have written. I got about halfway through it and just had a belly laugh. The plot makes no sense, unless you're a fan of daytime TV soap operas. The language is fakey-Victorian. I believe this book was commissioned to appeal to a specific target audience: working-class folks who don't really know Shakespeare but would like to fancy up their vocabulary some. I defy you to finish this book."
4,Huzzah! An entertaining Shakespearian yarn,"For a first time reader of a book of this nature, I must admit I really enjoyed it. I am a fan of Shakespeare so imagining him in a situation like this book purposes is both intriguing and fun. You have to go into this book with no preconceived notions of it being based on total fact. And yes, some elements are a bit fantastical. But if you are interested in the era and enjoy imagining what it might be like to live in that time period than this book provides a taste of the times. The style in which it is written gives us a hint of the speech and vocabulary of the era, without the tedium or complexity of a true Shakespearian novel. Perhaps a die-hard Shakespearian scholar may turn their nose up to such ""light"" and frivilous writting, but I sat back and enjoyed the ride. Huzzah!"
3,not what I expected,It was all the usual stuff I can find in any history book. I was hopping for more.
5,"Filthy ,fall'in down funny.","After the kids were snug in their sleeping bags and tents, their parents would pop the corks on their favorite brews and this collection of dirty, one-pager, country stories was passed from person to person around the campfire and read aloud. People would literally fall over, roaring with laughter, gasping for breadth. And often,the reader was paralized with laughter and couldnt continue. The stories are red neck filthy and funny beyond words. I didnt get the cultural relevance, I was too busy laughing. Not for the politically correct."
5,Funny breath of fresh air,"I like to read this book whenever I'm stressed out and realize I shouldn't take life so seriously. The fact that the tales are short but witty allows me to read them whenever I want, instead of having to read the whole book at once."
5,This book has to be included in my list of favorite books.,"This book has many, many Ozark folktales contained within its covers and ""Pissing in the Snow"" is one of the best. I do own a used copy purchased from Amazon.com. I do not know whatever happened to my first copy. One day when browsing Amazon.com I accidentally ran onto this book and just thinking about it brought back such fond memories that I placed an order for it that day. I have loaned this book out many times over with the results of this being one of the best books any of these folks have ever read. In my opinion it is a book that everyone should read."
3,"Difficult reading, very ""wordy""","This book was a required text for my PA course. It was very wordy and at times difficult to understand due to the repetitious content. I feel that there is probably a more straight forward style of writing than this one. Not for the student who is just beginning a public administration course, some back ground would be helpful if this text is to be used. However, it contains ""Introduction"" in its title. Well! I 'don't know about that? Great info, however, difficult reading."
4,A Good READ!,"Certainly a good read and well written. The most disturbing part was she almost got away with it! Certainly a page turner, and makes me wonder how much we take for granted. Defintely insightful and disturbing at the same time. A sad ending for the nine victims and their families. The book also looks into Dorotheas very sad childhood which is pathetic and horrible in itself. This woman should have got a lot of help in her early development years but sadly, like so many children she was abused. This of course does not preclude her from sentencing. The old adage, do the crime - do the time must be adhered to!"
4,Fascinating read,"I enjoyed this book. It is well written, easy to read and flowed. You finish the book knowing the horrible crimes that Dorothea Puente committed, but still not really knowing the real Dorothea Puente - then again I don't think anyone ever will."
3,"It's nice, but . . . .","This is a nice chair, but if you are looking for one that you can fold up and take with you (i.e, for makeup/hair artists, etc.), then this is not the chair for you. It is meant to be put up and kept up. Also, I found it very inconvienient that the canvas seat did not come with the chair. And canvas seats are not all the same; not every seat fits every chair. I bought one from a local retailer and it didn't fit. If you are looking for a barstool type chair and don't mind searching for the seat, then the price is good and the chair seems to be a quality item."
3,Directors Chair,The chair is nice looking. It is a little wobbly as I have had it for a few days. I weigh 125 lbs. and use the step up often. I feel it is still a stable chair just want others to know if they are above 150 lbs. this may not be a chair they would be comfortable with.
1,Very poor advertising and very poor customer service,"I agree with D Buchman. This company DOES NOT make it clear that the canvas back and seat is an option and the customer service is very obstinate that it was my fault that I did not read the small print! Also If you want to send it back they expect you to pay for shipping too.The photo clearly shows chair with canvas back and seat, the description states frame, but does not state FRAME ONLY!Beware, you HAVE to order the canvas as a secondary purchase so you also end up paying twice for shipping too!This is very poor advertising and I do not see that they are listening to these complaints.I do not understand why they do not just advertise the item with two options, what color frame and what color canvas would the customer like?The canvas is low price so I do not understand why they do this, it makes no sense to risk misleading the customer...."
3,"Nice, but...","Everything about this chair was fine, but the foot rest must be unscrewed and rescrewed each time it is folded for travel, which is the primary use for us as craft artists who use the chair at these shows. We had one many years ago that did not have this problem."
2,Just OK,Not as sturdy as I would have liked. The foot rest always feels like it is going to fall off.
5,Classic new grass and New Grass,"New Grass Revival defined a new sound for bluegrass, and it's one of the acts that got me interested in the genre back in the mid-90s. This album has it all, including the original version of ""Callin' Baton Rouge"" that blows the cowboy hat off Garth's version!"
4,fiction,this is a well-told little mystery with various characters and a surprising ending. the many plot twists throughout kept me guessing.
4,Dreaming,Reading this was a truly unique experience..whenI read the last sentence I felt as though I had woken up from a surrealistic dream.
1,Was this published in a basement?,"The book itself is great. This edition is terrible. Every aspect of it says amateur. The print and line spacing is way too small, making reading extremely tedious. No one wants to see that many words on a page. There are countless typos. The page numbers are enumerated in the bottom center. There is no writing on the spine, making it bad shelf material. The back is a promotion of the book, which is stylistically horrendous. Go for another publisher."
5,The Man Who Was Thursday; a nightmare,"A friend said I should read this because I enjoy good mystries. He was right, I enjoyed it very much. It is timeless."
2,Maybe It's Just Me,"G. K. Chesterton makes me feel stupid. Even when his work is entirely predictable--as this novel was--I wonder if he meant for it to be so and if the joke is really on me for thinking I've made a discovery the author intended to be patently obvious. Chesterton can be tongue in cheek about being tongue in cheek. His tone is a a series of nested Chinese boxes; it defies me. The author professes to be shocked at each unveiling in this novel. Yet, by the time the third figure is unveiled in similar fashion, a reader might begin to wonder--could Chesterton have been serious when he has the narrator express shock? I wasn't shocked. I thought, ""Should I be shocked that Chesterton is so unshocking?"" You can't win when the writer seems so much more clever than you are."
2,The Man who was Thursday- paperback book,I was under the impression I was ordering a new book but was disappointed when it came and looked slightly used. It was a christmas gift and I was embarrassed to give it.
4,A Modern Masterpiece,"Chesterton, the master of paradox, hits his stride in this dream of paranoia. For those of you who like your thrillers to pack their punches in terms of caliber, pints of blood shed, or body-count, you can all sod off. This is a thriller for the mind and the soul -- its aim is to save you from yourselves.If you want your English simple, straighforward, fed to you in easy subject-verb-object format, leave as well. This is more post-modern than any of those douchebags you've been fed in your graduate classes at U.C. Santa Barbara.If Chesterton is not the greatest modern author, then that is only because T.S. Eliot or Evelyn Waugh is slightly better.The chief pity is that Americans -- most direly in need of this sort of instruction -- will not read this work."
2,unimpressed,"I found this book to be very unimpressive. I know that it's supposed to be this great allegory and whatnot, but they story was mediocre and the ending, well I'm not sure that I'd call it an ending. In fact, I'm still not sure of what exactly happened at the end. Perhaps if I had read a better edition than the one I did, it would have explained it for me. Maybe I'm too dense for this book."
2,Worthy of Chesterton?,"I thought this book was an incredible bore, the kind of book your English teacher told you that all smart people think is great. I guess if you like ""The Necklace"" and ""The Lottery"" this is a great book. I found it to be very obvious and oh so melodramatic. The pacing is torturous to the point that the reader may decide that begging the author to stop will help."
3,"Too much religion, too little self control","I admire Chesterton very much (""The Innocence..."" and""Mr Pond's Paradoxes"" are masterpieces) However, I totallyagree with readers Skirmont & Diruni; this is technically a great work up to, say, two thirds of it. To my view, by then Chesterton was beginning to show signs of religious fanaticism, up to the point that he forgot he was writing a crime story. The end is most disappointing, unless one is willing to accept all the mystical stuff as belonging to a crime story. As per antisemitism, I would not say it is there, but, according to my experience, underneath a catholic obsession invariably creeps a little of anti-Jewish mistrust. (I may be wrong, but that is, at least, my perception as a non-Jewish person, grew up under Catholic principles and among catholics)"
4,"""Unusual""","I thought ""The Man Who Was Thursday:A Nightmare"" by G, K. Chesterton, Kingsley Amis was an unusual story with interesting characters, and, fast-pace dialogue. An interesting combination to be sure.John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures Inc."
3,Greg Gutfield's pick.,"I downloaded this book because a commentator on television said he enjoyed it.We obviously have different tastes though, because I found the archaic english was a bit too much of a distraction.I've read other books that were written around the turn of the last century, but it didn't bother me too much.Take that for what it's worth, some people might have more patience than I did at the time."
5,"This is my favorite, fun read!","I'm sure many people have gone into great detail about this book. All I want to say is that I have read it numerous times (10+ at this point) and I still enjoy the wonderful writing the well constructed plot the imagery, the word play, the sense of adventure, the mystery, on and on... It's my favorite, fun read!"
3,a mixed bag of Strangeness,"A strange and frustrating book, well rendered and compelling in parts, unbelievable (literally) and frustrating in others. The book is suspenseful, but there is too much nonesense that just doesn't contribute to the overall story or purpose of the book. I enjoyed the writing. Chesterton is great with words and imagery, but someone the premise and purpose remain obscrure. There wasn't a particular insight or profundity that I took away from it. Still, it is well written. I read the Penguin Edition with the Kingsly Amis intro and the great cover seen here (man seated with top hat)."
5,One of my favorite books!,"Fantastic prose, amazing plot twists. I'm not sure why it's not a movie. I buy copies and give them to people I meet who appreciates good books."
5,Maybe I read a different book than the rest of you...,"I must be something of a blockhead as I found no fascist or anti-semitic leanings in this novel. In fact, I merely thought it a right ripping adventure yarn with metaphysical overtones. To step from this book to accusations of anti-semitism is a bit far-fetched and not really tenable. The ending of the novel is fairly ambiguous and open, I think, to many interpretations."
4,A metaphysical mystery from Chesterton,"This is a pleasant escapade from GK Chesterton. Anarchists and detectives romp around England and France but in the end it's all very allegorical and metaphysical. Lots of religious imagery and aphorisms. Only for fans of Chesterton who want something deeper than the Father Brown stories. Also, this novel is in the public domain, and this particular edition was sloppily printed and had some typos."
4,Early terrorism thriller,"Today it's al Qaeda... in Chesterton's time it was anarchists, (""no government is good government,"" sort of early-period extremist Libertarians).But here Chesterton spun a fascinating tale of a policeman who goes under-cover to foil a bomb plot. The seven anarchists involved use day-of-the-week code names; thus, our policeman becomes ""Thursday"".As you approach the end of this fine work you might ask yourself, ""Where the heck is this thing going?"" But just hang in there -- it makes total sense when all is revealed.While I don't consider this work a real genuine page-turner, it did manage to maintain my interest. For me, this is Chesterton's Magnum opus.I highly recommend this 1908 book to anyone who is interested in thrillers, mysteries, and/or British literature."
1,"Cheap, right-wing, Christian-oriented schlock","This proto-fascist parable takes place on two levels simultaneously: it's both a mystery story and a piece of Christian edification. Unfortunately, it's a lousy detective story--as such, it simply makes no sense at all--and an ugly, fundamentally mean-spirited dogmatic work.Let's just begin with the hero's premise: he's a good guy, he works for the thought police. His job is to find anyone who promulgates dangerous ideas, and to stop them. By dangerous ideas, he means anything that goes against conformity, against the mainstream. This, in Chesterton's view, is a noble cause: to suppress any ideas that could undermine tyranny.Unless you're intending to study how an intellectual like Chesterton became involved with some strong anti-semitic groups, I recommend you avoid this one."
4,First time Chesterton Reader,"As a first time Chesterton reader I knew only that Chesteron was a Catholic appologist, but I expected something similar to C. S. Lewis. Big mistake; the story plays out like a farce, until the big suprise ending. Entertaining and thought provoking."
2,"Starts very well, then disappoints","This novel by G.K. Chesterton, starts very well, with a policeman so succesful in trying to infiltrate a group of anarchists that he is elected one of the bosses of the cell. Then things slowly becomes more muddled and the plot collapses halfway through the book, as it becomes more and more confusing and improbable and the author tries to feed on us too much indigestible philosophical baggage (Chesterton was a notorious political ultraconservative who seemed to find nothing worthwhile in the Europe after the Middle Ages). If you want to read a novel about early 20th century anarchists, I suggest instead you read Joseph Conrad's ""The Secret Agent""."
2,The Man Who Was Thursday,This book which was written in the early 1900s is about a Policeman/Poet that infiltrates a group of anarchists who are bent on breaking down society. There is some witty dialogue and satire in this but for the most part I couldn't get into it.
3,weird story with twists and turns,"A very interesting book. I didn't know what it was about when I bought it. As the story progressed, I finally figured it out. Once that happened, the twists and turns seemed less and less plausible and silly. The first half is well worth it, but don't hold your breath on the second half."
5,Visionary,"This book was far ahead of it's time. G.K. wrote in a style that pre-figured the likes of Gaiman and Diane Wynn Jones. It also contains the best and most bizarre chance scene that I have ever read. If you've seen the conclusion to the television series ""The Prisoner"" then you have a good idea of what to expect."
4,Philosophical Essay Wrapped in a Political Thriller,"You know how tortilla chips are just the vehicle to eat salsa or queso? In much the same way, this book is a vehicle for Chesterton to present his philosophy. When I started the book, I thought it was going to be a political thriller/mystery with philosophy thrown in. Actually, it turns out the book is philosophy with a political thriller/mystery thrown in. I realized this too late so missed a lot of the symbolism. This book addresses worldview, God, politics and more and is considered to be one of the top books of the 20th Century. You may have to read it more than once to understand it. I might even recommend that you read an analysis of the novel beforehand.Here is an analysis I found helpful:[...]"
4,Engrossing and out of the ordinary,Engrossing and out of the ordinary but drags and is repetitious toward the end of the story.
4,"Quick Read, Interesting Story","The first half of this book was very compelling (the story of the crimes) and gets 5 stars. The second half of the book, the arrest and criminal proceedings was just OK and gets 3 stars. So overall I give it 4 stars.It is a very quick read. I read it on my Kindle. I noticed some reviewers harping on typos or editing. I saw no issues. It appears to be clean. I actually saw a word ""administrix"" that I thought was a misspelling of ""administrator"" and it's not in the dictionary. But it is on the web and evidently is a legal term that was used correctly.This is a good book, not a great book. Worth a read if you like true-crime. Prepare to be disgusted by this awful woman."
2,Worst true life crime book ever,"Even though this is an interesting and tragic series of events, this book is one of the most poorly written I have ever read. The flow of the histories of the main characters was so disjointed and jumbled that it was very difficult to follow. In addition, the author interjected her own opinion very clearly throughout the entire book. Most of the true life crime authors I follow temper their opinions to allow the facts to be what they are. Ms. Barr is not an author I will be following in the future."
3,Kindle edition,"This is a review of the Kindle edition of the book. I am not sure if there is a revised edition available that I missed somehow, but I just read this book on my Kindle and found myself distracted by the typographical errors. I was very interested in the story, I just think that the Kindle edition of this book could really benefit from some good editing and proofreading."
3,Fatal Kiss - It was OK,This book was pretty good until the last 1/3 of the book. I'm always disappointed when an author has mnay pages that are simply a re-print of trial testimony. The first 2/3 of the book were enjoyable and the story held you.
1,Barr Should Be Ashamed,"I purchased this book based on the fact that my family has a very direct connection to the events. The book is somewhat factual but the sensational aspects of embellishment are what stand out. The author somehow presumes to know what is going through the mind of a man who's been shot in cold blood. For the information this book provides, if you're interested enough, you can get the same stuff out of the newspapers at your local library. This book is dime store trash complete with mentioned embellishments, typos, misspellings, and printed as though a do-it-yourself kit was used at home."
4,Good reading style,"Easy reading, you are able to put the book down and when you come back are able to pick up from where you left off."
5,Very Useful,This product is easy to set up!!! It arrived on time and in one piece :) I do recomend it.
5,Like my 4th time buying from this person.,"I've gotten my stuff very quickly, and in the condition specified (New). What else can I say?"
1,Flimsy product,"Not a gd product. It works . When I opened the cover to change the code the battery popped out !!! To open the cover ,u need to press hard and that leave scratch mark or might break the plastic as well"
4,Gate Opener,"Once I programed the remotes, they worked good. My only complaint is you have to pretty close to the gate to make them open. Not sure if it is the remotes or the way the gate was set up. But, THEY WORK!!!!!!!"
5,Great replacement garage door opener,"I have a rather old garage door opener and the remote was starting to die. I bought this based on the reviews and it works like a charm. You will probably have to flip a few dip switches inside the remote to get it to pair up with your opener but once you get that set, you should be good to go!I wanted to also add that ""yes"" it is a bit of a struggle getting the plastic door open to access the battery or flip the dip switches. It is not enough of a pain to warrant NOT buying this product."
5,Great Remotes,"I have ordered this product 2 times from this company because I needed extra backup remotes for more people. Both times, I have received the products on time and as described. They are a little tricky getting in to as the back cover to access the programming and battery area is very secure and tight. However, once you get in (be careful!!!), the programing is easy. Just match the 10 pin code and close it back up and click your garage open. Thanx!!!"
5,Works great,"Works great, super easy to program and got 2 for less than the gate company wanted to charge for one of them! Programing requires a quarter to open the case (hardest part) and a paperclip to set the switches. Came with a battery and everything!"
2,didn't work for my garage door opener,"After reading description, it sounded like it had a good chance of working with my older Sears Craftsmen garage door opener. It was not capatible - spent lots of time trying to code it - to no avail. Luckily they were relatively cheap - will just throw away."
4,Very objective and fact-oriented!,"As a Landmark Forum graduate, I found this book to be very complementary to the training I have taken at Landmark Education. Many of my unanswered questions around the person of Erhard and the est training are now fully answered."
1,Sadly lacking,"I had high hopes for using this as a teaching tool. Unfortunately, the students were, overall disappointing. I do not know if it was directorial convention or actor misinterpretation, but the entire play was presented like a reality show, with everyone screaming in anger at each other. There were no nuanced performances.The saving grace was the staging. The circus atmosphere and the sound gimmicks added to the idea of zany comedy.I am sorry, but I would not recommend this at the amount it cost."
1,NO GOOD - I threw it in the garbage,"I seriously believe this thing has dammaged my IPod. It would lock up my IPod when I was listening to it while charging. It also reads as charged within about 4-5 minutes of charging, but when I unplug it, is back down to only a quarter charged. I ended up throwing this in the garbage, the great price is not worth ruining an expensive IPod. Also, this item does not have the approved by UL stamp on it and it gets extremly hot while plugged in, even when its only been plugged in for about 20 minutes or less. BAD PRODUCT"
5,A great soundtrack to a great movie.,"The soundtrack to this movie is astounding. If you saw the movie, you'll definitly love the soundtrack.It makes you reminisce on the movie. From the first to the last title, you'll find yourself wanting to see the movie again.Definitly a must buy for any soundtrack lover."
4,God AWFUL mastering job -Unlistenable!,"There's some great music on here, but it's very hard to listen to. It is so incredibly jacked up in volume (BRICKWALLED) it's unbelievable. I've heard some loud CDs, but this one is up there in my top 10 worst. This makes most ""modern"" remasters sound good. It's a horrible mastering job, and it completely ruins the music. There are no dynamics, and the treble is way too high. Turn your stereo DOWN before playing this or you may damage your speakers. Not kidding- I can't listen to this, it's going to the used shop. Too bad because I'm a big fan. How anybody can think this sounds good is beyond me. ughhh...Save your money, and Bill if you're reading this, PLEASE never let Russell Pay master anything you do again."
2,Not good for faxing things. Blank Pages.,"I really like the look of this fax machine, and I love the fact that it's compact and doesn't take up much space. I haven't received any faxes yet, so I don't know how well the prints will look. So far, I'm having a lot of trouble faxing things out though. I've sent faxes 4 times, and 2 of the 4 times, the receiver received missing pages. They sent me a PDF of what I had faxed them, and the missing pages just showed up as a blank pages.I already threw out the box, so I can't even return it. I feel like the machine was a waste of money."
5,This replaces another Panasonic,"We had another Panasonic fax for many years and were very happy with it. When it stopped working one day, there was no question we would replace it with another Panasonic. Interestingly enough, by the time the new model was delivered the old one started to work again, so now I'm looking for a home for it.What I like better about this Ultra-compact design is that it's even smaller than the previous one. We have very limited space and this is perfect. One disappointment: we can't use the same size film, but that's understandable since the span between the manufacturing time is so great.It works like a charm and was easy to set up."
3,Compact fax machine,"This is what I was looking for - a compact and easy to use machine. I have an all-in-one machine. But for occasional faxing need, it's too much trouble to use that one. This Panasonic fax machine is supposed to replace an old and big Panasonic phone/fax. So far I found that it's missing one function. It does not have speakerphone(many online places used this term). But it just has a one-way ""monitor"". Too bad, but for the price...."
1,"Product was not new from Amazon, LLC.","It was noted as ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com."" as new. But it came returned product and lot of damage on box. I'm not sure if it has complete set. Product seems fine. I'd return product, but film cartridge was already purchased from other place. Very disappointed to Amazon to sell as new."
3,Got a diffrent one...it's great & has phone,"If one has trouble, they 'probably' missed something in the instructions, sometimes 1 step is all it takes for something (especially electronics) not to work properly. This one is the model # at end is 205, there is really a good one...We bought the # ASIN: B002B376IS# Item model number: KX-FP215, it's GREAT! It has a phone, speakerphone(sounds good! especially when I am waiting for a rep to answer at any company), fax (gives a confirmation of time & received) & copier. Uses a film, good copies! We moved, but we left it to my father-in-law (helps get those junk calls ,like junk mail), we're going to get another one for us at our new home in a couple of weeks."
1,Rest in peace...,"Bought the machine for personal use to send and recieve occasional business documents between households of our family, I'm the family business manager. The machine was used less than half-a-dozen times and then it just stopped working. I threw it out as the warrenty was expired."
4,Plain paper fax,Does all I purchased this for. Makes good faxes and have had no problems with it. Nice enough for my needs also small enough.
1,Panasonic KX-FP205 Sold by AMAZON - wrong color!,"I purchased this fax machine for my Home Office which also doubles as a TV room for the kids. I wanted to update the area and get a smaller fax and also get rid of the old officey beige color so my work area would be more in line with the modern decor in this room. This fax machine was shown in black in the photo - exactly what I wanted. ALERT = this fax is NOT black, nor gray, nor anything like it. It is BEIGE! Not sure what to do as I have never had to return an item before to Amazon and would hate it if they stuck me with the return shipping. The specs on the product do not refer to color at all, so I was led to believe it looked like the photo pictured. I want the small black fax I ordered! I am so disappointed."
1,Not much extra info,Only watched the first 20 min because I really didn't get anything different than Bill Phillips described in his book.
2,Not for me,"I have seen this show on TV maybe 2 or 3 times --- usually when flipping through the channels looking for something to watch. While ""cute, it just doesn't appeal to me. If you want funny, you should watch (and purchase) ""Big Bang Theory"" --- my whole family loves that show!"
5,Awesome!!!!,Very happy with this!!!!! Love the show!!!! Would definitely rate it with a 5-star rating. One of the funniest new shows.
2,2 broke girls not so funny,A new show which seemed promising but fell flat. The show reminds me of the smash hit Alice but 2 Broke Girls is no Alice.....the show isnt funny and the punch lines are too raunchy for my taste. Again you can find this dvd cheaper if you look around. Let's hope Amazon lowers the price on this dvd. Do I recommend this dvd...no. Instead pick up the first season Alice.
3,Who the heck still buys DVDs?,"Get your act together, CBS. Get these on iTunes. The removable media age is over.Three stars for the show."
4,"Funny, Humorist",A great way to spend a few hours with a couple of good looking ladies laughing and having fun with your family or friends.
5,2 broke girls dvd movie,"As many of my other items ordered in this frame time. This movie also was a Christmas gift for my son. I myself have not seen it, but my son let me know that the dvd is in great condition and says thank you"
5,A gift purchased at Amazon.com,"This is an item that a family member has on their Christmas wish list. I haven't seen the DVD personally, but I was able to find ""2 Broke Girls: The Complete First Season"" on Blu-Ray. To give the young person the gift they requested is a treat for me. It as a great find on amazon.com!"
5,GO MR. K!,This book is so great! Steve Kucinski is an amazing writer as well as a great teacher. He is great with kids and it obviously shows through this amazing book. He really understands what it is like and helps kids to see their greatest potential. Congrats Mr. K on this amazing accomplishment and I am sooo proud of you!! :)
4,SWISS ARMY VICTORINOX V7-11,"UNA DE LAS CARACTERISTICAS MAS RESALTANTE ES EL MATERIAL DEL CUAL ESTA HECHO EL RELOJ, DE BUEN COLOR Y RESISTENTE. MUY BUENO PARA EL USO COTIDIANO."
4,Ivan Klansky plays Janacek beautifully,"This CD features the gorgeous Janacek piano pieces that appeared on the soundtrack of _The Unbearable Lightness of Being_. The sensitivity and delicate touch that Klansky shows is outstanding. Just listen to track 4, ""The Madonna of Frydek,"" which was the centerpiece of the movie. Klansky's touch is masterful, particularly in his use of silence in the beginning and ending of the piece. I believe Milan Kundera suggested Klansky's versions to director Philip Kaufman, and how right he was-- other interpreters of this music just do not embue it with the emotion that Klansky does. An essential CD.The CD is 52 minutes long and was recorded in Prague in 1980. NOTE: Shame on Amazon for not putting Klansky's name in its info about this CD!"
5,One of a Kind,"This recording shows how they used to play country music in the old honky-tonk days. Although Dave Dudley was not from Bakersfield, his sound was as bare-bones as the great musicians that called that city home.""Six Days on the Road"" was his great classic, and along with ""Truck Driving Man"" (also included here) , ""Phantom 309,"" (not on this CD), and a few others, represents the cream-of-the-crop of the classic truck driving songs.Some of the songs here were not hits, and some were hits for other people. Dave and his group do a fine job with all of them. These guys really know how to play country music. I especially enjoy the guitar licks.But the best part is Dave's deep, growling, distinctive voice. Mention Dave to any old trucker, and you'll have a new friend. No one else like Dave Dudley, and never will be."
1,Dave Dudley Trucker Classics,"NOT what I expected!!! Not the original Dave Dudley songs that I enjoyed. Must be later versions. Great old trucker songs, but the lyrics and music of even his songs are not the same as the originals. BIG LET DOWN!!! Look for earlier versions of this GREAT artist if you can find them!!"
2,OK!,This book was good but I found it a little inconsistent. It did not flow. And giant spiders COME ON!!!
1,Ecological rant is right!,"Is this a story or a text book? I can't decide. Amid a deluge of scientific information better left inside a text book on aquatic biology, you'll find bits of story strewn throughout, seemingly aimed at grammar school children. It is very obvious within the book where Anthony and Pickover switch writing. Anthony's pieces are polished, and don't contain overwhelming detail, while Pickover's are stilted and waxy, containing more than you ever wanted to know about invertebrates. The obvious environmentalist slant is at times unbearable. For a more accurate picture of our environment, I would recommend 'The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World' by Bjorn Lomborg - he bothers to get facts straight, and doesn't seem to 'rant'...All in all, what started out as something I expected to rival Peter Benchly, Steve Alten ('Meg') or Licoln Child and Douglas Preston turned into a disjointed, rambling tale that I cannot in good conscience recommend."
1,"Worse than Anthony's ""Firefly""","Absolutely the worst ""monster"" book I've read in a long time. The characters are shallow and uninteresting while the ""action"" lacks the visceral horror of King, the timing of Koontz and the originality of Barker. It isn't even good Anthony! Nothing in this story was even remotely entertaining and the ending is so bad it's only shocking in its stupidity. A very, very disappointing novel from a once entertaining author."
3,ok but not the best,"This book is ok if you like to read because it is very dull for the first 100 pages. It was boring in the beginning because the author just talked about every little detail, most were not important.The beginning and end were very interesting because it involves many battles with the enemy. This book is about a woman who loves fish, she hates humans though because they are destroying the earth. Her name is Martha. She conducts experiments to make a large sea spider known as a psychonid. The spider was supposed to be the first of many of its kind to keep humans away from the coasts by killing them. A group of humans try to stop the giant spider from killing. Since this book contains so much detail you will feel very accustomed to the characters. As they battle with the monster. At times it was difficult to read so I recommend it to ages 15+."
1,Second worst book I have ever read,"I don't usually write reviews, but this book is so appallingly bad that I wanted to spare anyone else the misfortune of picking this thing up. I have only read one other book that was worse, and it was a vanity published book that sold a few dozen copies at best. I personally do not believe that Piers Anthony had anything to do with this book besides letting his name be used. Good luck!"
1,Worst.novel.ever,"I saw Spider Legs at a surplus department store. 4 bucks for a Piers Anthony? Yes!...I want my four dollars back. Weak plot...check that, STUPID PLOT. A mad scientist with big teeth creates an aquatic killer the size of an elephant and no one has even a hunch? No prototypes? No middle-sized killers. Nope. We go straight from the drawing board to a horrible monster of the deep that even has a captain's cabin on board so our mad scientist can go a-riding in her creation. I wonder what she used for the stereo onboard. I'm not sure XM radio would work.And worse than the plot are the insipid characters. Too much time spent on the convenient love connection. And c'mon...two experienced cops board a ship with the express intention to find a elephant sized killer...and they only bring pistols???Horrible horrible horrible."
4,"Fun to read, some twists too simple.","I enjoyed reading the book, I especially like the detatched descriptions of things, allowing the characters to show the only opinion. The ony pitfall I saw was the sudden and under-complicated way in which things changed. Such as then end when Mary decided to modify her mission, when she had always struck me as an excessively stubborn person"
2,Not So Good But Works,"I got this net to use as a second net as I have two friends joining me this year on fishing outings and figured they can catch some other their bait without me doing all the work. The net works yes but here is why I gave it the low rating I did.1: For those who are new, it does not com assembled and newbies might get a little confused with putting it together. Its not hard but I've seen it happen.2: The quality is ok but not great. It could be better.3: It does not have over flap sides. I dont know how to describe it but its just a square net where as all my others have sides on them that better hold in your catch.4: The main low rating is that for $2 - $4 more you can buy a better quality net from Cabela's that is already put together, a little plastic bag to keep it in when not in use, two different sizes, a little rope to use and sides that better hold your catch.So in the end this net works but could be better. I use the net but not as much as my other one."
4,excellent,"works great off a pier with a long pole.the fish will see you and swim away.placed some bread on the water,place the net on top of the bread, hide,pull the net up quickly with the long pole.lots of fish,some nice size"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This is a look at even more of the Tolkien milieu. This is chock fullof the mythology, looking in even greater detail than The Silmarillionat the history of the elves and their travels, for example.This is composed by the kid from notes and other materials that his father left around."
4,An excellent companion,"This book was the ""first"" silmarillion, that Tolkien wrote during and directly after the first world war. It contains some of the first 'real' stories that he conceived about middle earth."
2,Sadly Disapointing,I am the biggest fan of LOTR but did not care for this book. It was hard to read and confusing.
2,boring,boring BEYOND BELOEF===i WANT A HOBIT OR SOMETHING A WASTE OF MONEY and time so very sad from all perspectves
3,Tolkien,Christopher doesn't quite have all that his dad did. But this is still a good read for Tolkien lovers.
5,An insite on the early Silmarillion,"In Christopher Tolkien's first volume in The History of Middle Earth series he brings to light his father's original conception of what became known as the Silmarillion. This volume deals with the central theme in Tolkien's early works where an Englishman named Elfwine (or Eriol in Elvish) is told the history of the Elves after finding the ""straight road"" to Tol Eressea. This book deals mostly with Elvish history before the coming of men, and the later histories can be found in another great book, The Book of Lost Tales 2. I would recommend this book, along with all twelve of the other volumes, to anyone who enjoyed Tolkien's works but found them to be too short and would like more information. Also, for those interested in making a career out of writing this series is a very good example of the hardship required to write a classic work of fiction."
1,NOT Illustrated!,"I ordered this book because I hoped my junior-higher who reads graphic novels would read it if it was illustrated: It was listed on the Amazon website as illustrated. It is NOT. It is a hardcover 1st-edition and valuable, and it was in the ""very good"" condition advertised; so I intend to keep it as an investment. Not illustrated, NOT good for younger readers who aren't excited about text-only editions"
5,Finally!,"Somehow, many years ago, I only ended up with Volume 2. Finally, after all these years, I decided to get the other copy, along with the other books that make up Chris Tolkien's ""History of Middle Earth"". Great to have it!"
4,classic Tolkien,"this book is a must for Tolkien lovers, the stories are in digestible sizes and it is a great read for casual reading"
3,It's only for the dedicated Toklien reader,"The book of lost tales is more a scholarly presentation of fragments of JRR Tolkien's notes and papers. Christopher Tolkien has done an admirable job of collecting and editing his father's unedited notes to fill in gaps about the legends of Middle Earth. It is not however an engaging read. One must treat it like a text book, rather than a novel or collection of short stories."
4,Beyond The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings,This is a very worthy read. It gives you an inside in with the Middle Earth world and back ground stories.
2,There is a Reason JRR Tolkien didn't publish these tales,"I am the biggest tolkien fan there is.....Stick to the books he continued to work on throughout his life; The LOTR the Hobbit, The Silmarillion and even Unfinished Tales.... Once you stray into the bounds of Christopher Tolkien's Ego you will find yourself wondering what you are doing. These notes scribbles and random thoughts of the master are unreadable...I mean all of them from volume 1 to volume 12. How many times can you re read the tale of the children of Hurin? In a row? WHO CARES!!Do yourself a BIG FAVOR.....Re read the Hobbit and the LOTR instead. NOT WORTH YOUR EFFORT"
5,A great book for the curiosity of Tolkien fans,"I first found myself in the world of Tolkien about two years ago, and the I find that the more of it I read the more I want to know. The sheer complexity behind the Silmarillion astounds me because its like entering into an epic, complicated, life-like history as complicated as our own. This book gives a little of how that history evolved into what it finally became, and suggests some of the possiblities for it that Tolkien had, along with other books in this series. After reading the Silmarillion I was left with a great curiosity and wanted to find out more; discovering this book helped, and reading it give me most of my answers, though it did leave far more questions. All said though, it is worth the read for any fan of Tolkien"
3,Beautiful but dense,"The writing is beautiful but it's sometimes tough going. Unlike the Hobbit and LOTR, where the hobbits brought the ideas down to earth, this book is all ""high fantasy."" It's easy to get lost here."
5,"The Birth Of Tolkien's ""Middle Earth""","This is a fine introduction into the early phases of Tolkien's writing as he began the tales which would become the core of his ""Silmarillion"". His son Christopher does an excellent job providing critical commentary and annotations regarding his father's early work. Undoubtedly a must read for amateur scholars of Tolkien as well as his fans."
5,I loved this book,"It was daring, adventurus, sad, joyful and victorius at the same time. I've never read a book quite like it."
1,"Great Collection, but sloppy mastering","Although this is a unique collection with some very good track choices, ""Hot Stuff"" shows up once again, in its butchered format. This problem track has been circulating for years and appears in its defective state on at least three other compilations that I'm aware of, including the now out-of-print ""Walk Away - Collector's Edition - The Best of 1977-1980"". The issue isn't with the version of the song chosen, but with the sloppy mastering. Quite simply, the track starts late, thereby affecting the overall impact of the song's opening. Although only a split second or two off, it's the equivalent of dropping the needle on the record part way through the track. Ugh! Buyer beware. If this doesn't bother you, than go for it. But as for me, I cringe every time the track comes up."
4,Great for covering gray!,"Been using this product for years.I like the ash shadebecause it doesn""t turn my hair too brassy/red looking.Italso lasts between applications."
1,"Doesn't Cover. Messy, drippy formula","A complete waste. Didn't cover gray. Formula is very thin and drippy. Watch your eyes. Gloves they give you are big , floppy and difficult to work with."
5,The Beast Hauled Up,"I'll let Susan Howe, poet-scholar, speak on this one: ""I think the most exciting book on Melville recently [1989] is Subversive Genealogies...Melville, like Hamlet, saw the ghost under the helmet. How do you act when you know what you know? As Olson puts it in the ""Letter [for Melville 1951],"" 'this beast hauled up out of great water was society'. The Leviathan. Moby. Rogin beautifully shows how Melville works in and around, for and against what he sees and says...Home, politics, and art are here together as they should be. You cannot separate an author from family, history, and ideology."""
2,Not the original artist!!,"These are hits that have been reproduced by Countdown, and are not the original versions of the song. The singers are close but not as good (i.e. the female vocalist can't belt out the high notes so they sing lower or not at all). Many of the tracks have week base lines and poor sound quality.Bottom Line: If your not a huge fan of dance music then you might not even notice the difference. But if you are familer with the originals then listening to imatations might get annoying."
2,NIGHT WOLF LACKS BITE,"Set in the murky English countryside, NIGHT WOLF could have been a worthy werewolf saga. The operable word here is COULD; poor lighting, a muddled, predictable script and weak performances sabotage the film's effectiveness. The effects are likewise unimaginative and the movie employs lots of screaming and jittery camera work to elicit the suspense.Isabella Calthorpe and REVENGE's Joshua Bowman struggle but can't overcome the material. AMERICAN WEREWOLF and THE HOWLING are still the most enjoyable wolf-tales. Watch them instead."
1,Horrible,"One of the reasons I decided to give this a try was because of the ""From one of the producers of Dog Soldiers"" on the cover. Dog Soldiers is a great a movie. Unfortunately, the producer they got for this film must have been the one that sucked, cause this movie was bad. The ""big name"" Tom Felton is killed off early on, leaving you with some truly horrific acting. The special effects were less than lack luster. And if that wasn't bad enough, the ""werewolf"" looked truly horrible. I've seen better makeup on kids at halloween.The only good thing about the movie was......wait..there wasn't any.Absolutely don't waste your time on this, unless you want to see the crappiest werewolf movie since Full Moon High. (at least that was comical!)"
3,This is a decent knife stand,"What I like about this stand is that it is made from a clear plastic, so it doesn't take away from the knives you are trying to display. This works for some of the knives in my collection, but the slot for the blade will not fit well if the blade is thicker. For Buck hunting knives it works great, because they have a tapered edge that fits nicely, but if you want to put others on, it doesn't work as well. I have some on now that semi-fit and it works well enough for my purposes. You can't really beat the price, so I'm ok with not being able to display certain ones on it."
5,Sprayer Nozzle,This battery operated nozzle sprayer makes life so much easier and your fingers don't go numb from pulling the old style sprayer nozzle. Just hold the trigger and point and it does the work for you. Fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!! I can attached it to any round-up jug and spray away and kill those pesty weeds. Doesn't get any easier or better than this sprayer nozzle. Good price also.. Have had it over 2 years and just replace your batteries and it just keeps on working year after year. Great Product!
2,Examples and problems constructed by inexperienced students,"I have a master's degree in Electrical Engineering. I tutor students who are using this book in a community college course. In layout and in format, the book is very good. The concepts are presented in logical order, and the principles are usually explained well.My problem is that the examples and the end-of-chapter problems are full of errors. Example: Section P.6, ""Rational Expressions"" presents several examples to define the domain of an expression. Most of these conclude with the incorrect domain. This kind of sloppy editing can leave the student totally confused about a concept that is all-important to understand later concepts, such as systems of equations and series summations.I fully believe that the author left the basic book construction in the hands of inexperienced students. Its too bad that he did not bother with some double-checking of the work."
1,COLLEGE ALGEBRA 3RD ED,NEVER RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT WOULD LIKE MY MONEY REFUNDED PLEASE DO NOT USE SECONDARY VENDORS FROM AMAZON SITE USE THEM ONLY
5,Fanatics of Liberty ....,"they r amazing brilliant people from Algeria with an open mind for what's happening in the world today ...and aspecialy in their third world Algeria ... reggae music is the their soul with brilliant tempo uplifting ur life to a very very high vibrations ....something like Manu Chao, Sergento Garcia, Shotey A Nevuafreedom people"
4,Ya Laymi,"This song is a very good music, the best is who mix sound of Arab with reggae, i feel that if you like the reggae should to listen this song."
4,"an incredible, energetic mix of styles","This is one wild CD! After establishing their Gnawa credentials with the traditional-sounding first track, the remaining songs grab the listener with a mad, exhilerating rush, firing shot after shot from the cannon as traditional North African sounds are mashed seemlessly into reggae, ska, Jamaican toasting with hints of dub, and even speed metal (?!). In one song, a muzzein call from the sunset minerets of Istanbul turns into a hybrid belly dance cut with greek bouzouki. Wonderful! The musicianship, arrangements, and singing are impeccable, as is the whole concept of this group and this album. To my ear, it sounds like the vocals are in Arabic, French, and English. There is tremendous variety on this CD, and each cut is done exceedingly well (ie. it doesn't at all sound like they are hitting a bunch of styles just to show they can, with the danger of their reach exceeding their grasp). I can't wait to hear the other releases from these guys."
3,Not bad,"I am replacing my original 680 battery because it suddenly stopped holding a charge. After ordering the battery, my original battery got better. That was handy because the first battery I received did not work at all. I called and bargaincell immediately sent a replacement in an envelope with return postage sticker. The replacement worked just fine. No better at holding a charge than the year old original, but it works well."
5,Sweetness,"I can't believe how much light these little things put out. It easily beats my normal driving lights, which are upgraded halogen bulbs. The light spread covers everything in front of you and they look too slick installed. I didn't need to use the light harness that is included, but it is a complete and full harness for a professional install."
2,NO CHAPTER DIVISION,"It's a GREAT book by Bunyan. But as the title says, that is a huge drawback of this book to me personally."
3,This is the modern english version,"I just bought this edition, and was disapointed to learn that it is an updated, modern english edition of the original. I prefer to read books as they were first written, whenever possible.From the brief comparisons I've made, it seems that this edition comes across somewhat less colorful than Bunyan's original, as the revisionist appears to have tried to simplify the vocabulary rather than merely updating it."
1,Mossy Oak License Plate Frame,"Bought this same item from Walmart,it did not fit good against my existing Jeep tag mount plus the colors faded bad due to sun exposure."
2,Bad effort.,"As I was reviewing this book for a class I was teaching on the subject, I could'nt help but think the author's effort was rushed. This book would be good for someone with a strong data modeling background who wants a new perspective. It is a poor choice for novices to the field. Explanations are lacking in clarity. Book is poorly organized. Check out Inside Relational Databases, Whithorn."
3,Good but uses old style data modeling syntax,I liked the book however it annoys me that the author uses the outdated data modeling language called IDEF1X which I have never ever seen used in any other project or by any professional data modelers. They all use the IE crows foot method for data modeling. So it became confusing after a while having to switch back and forth between IDEF1X and crows foot syntax in the data modeling. Thats why I only give it 3 stars. Other than that excellent treatment of data modeling and relational design concepts.
1,Do NOT buy this incomplete book,"This is a facsimile of an old book, and it sounds wonderful. But in fact, this volume only contains a portion of the original book. Although it starts with something labeled ""chapter 1,"" that is the original first chapter of the second half of the book, which was divided into two parts when it was first published. No where do the publishers indicate that this book contains only a portion of the text of the original. Furthermore, the book was NOT written by Charles Meredith but by his wife, Louisa Meredith; presumably this error comes from the fact that the 19th century volumes were sometimes attributed to MRS. Charles Meredith. But I have to wonder what other kinds of errors are made by a reprint publisher who can't even get the name of the author right on the title page and who sells as a complete book something that is really only a portion of the text as the original. Don't waste your money."
1,Not the full book.,"This is not the full book (but this is not stated anywhere, nor is there anywhere to purchase the other ""half"" of this text). Do not purchase. I have had issues with several Bibiobazaar reprints, beware of these reproductions."
2,not what i expected at all,"Have always loved countertop grills, have had several including two George Foremans, but my Hamilton Beach of 20 years ago was my first. i thot i could duplicate its fine results of back then but i was wrong. it overcooks or burns everything but the middles are raw still. this was not the purchase i thought it would be."
5,Pure Agro Beer Swilling Power Rock!!,"THIS IS THE SH**!! The Hellacopters' Super Shitty to the Max! is the definition of RAAWK!! This red-lined power chord monster will rattle your ear drums and shake your soul...and any derision against this over driven distortion masterpiece is pure braindead folly...Yeh, the sound is distorted; the drums are distorted;the vocals distorted; guitars feeding back continuously-it sounds like they were all pumped up on Speed and Beer! Well, So What! This ain't Guns & Roses losers,this is The Hellacopters, and if you don't like it, well ""Why should I care!"", ""Cause you bore me, and you're not alone!"",Dig!!"
1,Been done before,"This is a very crap release. The songs are a slap dash effort, sounding like they have been put together at the last minute. Save your money and buy the best swedich band in the world. ABBA."
4,These sound great!,"***UPDATE*** I've decided to upgrade the rating to 5 stars. These speakers have outstanding performance for the money.(4.5 stars) These speakers for the money, are an outstanding value. I paid $25 and I couldn't be much happier. The highs are very clear and detailed and the bass response is quite powerful and tight as well (for a 4x6). These speakers aren't top of the line, but I believe they're as good as anything you'll find in the price range. These are a definate safe buy and are highly recommended."
2,How many engineers does it take to design a screenwipe?,"I use this wipe for use with my laptop. I have read bad reviews on other screen wipes and this is no different, don't be fooled by the lack of bad reviews. It wipes off dirt, lint, air particulate quite handily (so does alcohol and a kleenex), however it leaves streaks that last even after it has ""dried"". Very frustrating!"
1,Has to be better options.,"This pickup was not what I expected. I ordered it as the first acoustic pickup I've ever owned. I received it and it worked for maybe 5 minutes. The output from the pickup was fairly quiet and I had to turn my amp up to some of the highest settings. The pickup stopped working after 5 minutes of use and to say the least I'm not a big fan of the solderless jack. I returned the product and got my money back. Granted, my experience may just be isolated, but for the money there has to be better options available."
4,Great accessory for my guitar,"I have an Alvarez RD8 acoustic dreadnaught and wanted to experiment with mixing my own playing and singing using an entry-level mixer, mike, and this device. It was sort of a ""reality check"" to see if anything sounded good enough to perform -- I'm still working on that part. The pickup was a pleasant surprise. It fit the sound hole perfectly though the cable is prone to getting in the way (that's the reason for the 4 stars). It's quite an experience to hear yourself ""plugged in"" for the first time. I'd recommend this pick-up to anyone who uses an plain acoustic and want to record or amplify their guitar. It's a good name brand, nice price, and of good quality constuction. I didn't experience and distortion or feedback problems and so far, the neighbors haven't complained either."
3,Good sound but bad Hummmmm!,"I play vintage instruments live. So I usually mic them in order to get the natural sound and nuances of the vintage guitars. However, I occasionally need to have an acoustic electric. I was advised to get the DM Pro Mag. I got the single coil at first. I was very impressed with its ability to make a vintage acoustic guitar sound like a vintage acoustic. However the constant Hummmmmmm made it unusable for a performance. I returned it and got a humbucking version (which I should have done from the get go). The humbucking version works perfectly and is silent. Spend a few more dollars and get the humbucking version like Pro Mag Grand or the Pro Mag Grand."
2,Pickup would not fit guitar,I have a Takamine Acoustic Guitar and the Markley PU would not fit into the sound hole even withn the suggested fitting modifications. Hence PU is of no use to me. This is false advertizing and I should get my money back.
2,Ok for amateur night..,"Picked this up at a local shop for a gig the next day. I didn't have huge expectations for the thing, single coil in the hole pick-up, what do you want? I have a Martin DX series, and the pickup didn't sit in the hole well at all. I could sort of wedge it back towards the bridge and it would stay, but if it was in the middle of the sound hole it was completely loose. Plugged it in and immediatly had to crank up my amp, which was hissing and buzzing. I unplugged the thing, and swapped it out for another guitar to confirm it was the pickup and not the cord. It was the pick up. No volume control is lame BTW. You need to be able to turn it down or off IMO. I borrowed a guitar and returned it.The sound is not terrible, it delivers OK tone. You could put one in for open mic night and get away with it. You couldn't record with it, and you sure wouldn't want to get loud with it. If you have the inclination, get a saddle pick up. It's worth the added cost."
4,"Easy, cheap and does the job","As excited as one can get over a practical item like this, I am very pleased that it delivers as promised: easy to install and talks to each other even across our large 4000 sq ft house. We haven't experienced any false alarms, but then again we haven't had an actual fire so haven't experienced any real alarms either. But we tested them and they seem to work great. Excellent value too."
5,Great because of linking,"These dectectors are wireless and can be linked together, for those who have a hearing disability (military) they allow me to monitior not only the detecotor in the house but thee garage and shop as well."
5,Easy to install and works great,"I purchased 8 of the smoke detectors and they were easy to configure using dip switches. After setting them all to the same code just insert the included batteries and test them. Installation took about 5 minutes per unit and consisted of marking spot for a hole, drill the hole, push in the drywall plug, use 2 screws to secure the unit. The alarms are quite loud and linked so they all go off if there is a fire. I can't comment on long term use as they have only been installed about a week."
1,I got a lemon,"I installed the alarm and it wouldn't stop alarming. The hush button didn't work. After pressing it, the green LED was supposed to flash, which it didn't."
2,Goes Off When I Make Toast,"Bought this based on all the great reviews and I had heard Kidde was a great brand, but the ones in my kitchen and garage are driving me nuts. It goes off pretty sporadically, sometimes when we make toast (not burnt), or when we are we are sautéing veggies, or when my Fiance starts up his motorcycle in the garage. They are both positioned as far away from the things that set them off as possible while still being in the room. They are just very sensitive I guess, too sensitive for my taste..."
4,Kidde Battery Operated Interconnectable.,Good product. One of the few detectors that trip all of the alarms in the house when one sense smoke.
4,Great product!,"I think this is a great product. As advertised, if one goes off, all go off. I really feel safe in my home now with this product.Dislikes:-No strobe... Only audible noiseLikes:-All go off-Very loud!-Reliable product"
5,Works as advertised,"I bought this wireless smoke detector and another that replaces one of my hard-wired detectors. When this detector goes off, it sends a signal to the hard-wired detector which sets off all the smoke detectors in the house. Great idea and works as advertised."
2,Did we read the same book?,"I love baseball and novels, and maybe I was expecting too much (based on the glowing reviews here!), but this book is virtually unreadable. There are some good ideas there, but the writing is atrocious, the editing worse. I cannot recommend this book to anybody."
1,"Lunatics, indeed!","I knew most of the people in this movie, which was filmed locally in the area around Brewster, New York. In fact, I went out with a member of the cast.....who boasted that he was in ""the worst movie ever made"". It's got gratuitous violence, major holes in the plot....yeah, it's a stupid movie, but good for a laugh or two. All the cast members were ""discovered"" in a local community theatre production in Brewster.That's a real Carmel cop car in there...a character name changes from one scene to the next, and scenes that would have pulled the plot together were cut from the film.Joe Niola puts in a hilarious performance as Igor.The scary thing was seeing the announcement after the movie... ""If you liked this film, we have more like it."""
2,A very confusing movie,"And the fact that this one is so confusing does most definitely work against it. I had a lot of trouble following the plotline of this film. Further, it is not really very frightening at all, being instead rather tedious. The story is about a serial killer who leads a cult of hippies (gee, I wonder where they got this idea from). The lead character is not even the one named Igor! In the movie Igor is just a member of this murderous group. This is one that you can skip. Even the added features on the DVD aren't worth the time."
4,Some great songs for working out,"I definitely recommend some of these songs for the gym. Overall, I found the record enjoyable, but there are a few tracks I'd throw out.Here's the tracks I feel stand out:All about me --> kiss the sky (I say you need them together -- these two were mixed well)Tracking Treasure downPiece of HeavenAliveBad Boyand finally, the BEST song on the record and the one you must take with you to the treadmill...Satellites. The beat of the song along with its message makes it a must for the gym."
5,If You Don't Like It You Haven't Listened Enough,"That's the way it is with classics. Give this album time; uncover sly humor and sound puns. For example, a whistle interrupts a cartoon ragtime band. Obviously the start of a horse race. Or is it rolling thunder? And what's that next brain tickle? A monsoon downpour? A very scratchy LP? Wonderwall's packed with jack-in-the-box delights, just don't expect to find them right away.This album establishes that Harrison defined the Beatles' sound far more than he got credit for. The next best thing to finding a previously-unknown trove of Beatles recordings. Possibly the best solo effort by any of the four."
1,Stinks,"I love the Beatles. I love George. But this stinks. Except for a few delightful ditties, this is a bore (straight or otherwise...) Stick to ordering ALL THINGS MUST PASS by George for a real masterpeice."
2,George not at his best,The only interesting music is (2) of the Indian tracks. The rest is poor movie sound tract filler.
4,"Do I Enjoy This, or . . . . ?","I think that this album is growing on me. It has no pop hooks, and tracks like ""Crying"" seem to go on and on until . . . wow! Maybe that did sound good!Another reviewer mentioned its similarity to Magical Mystery Tour. Indeed, one only needs to listen to Wonderwall to understand the very monumental influence that George Harrison had on creating the ""Beatles Sound."" It wasn't all John and Paul. Wonderwall makes you realize that it was durn close to a three-way tie. (And some may argue that Ringo's influence was right up there too, based on his constantly improving solo work).I think that Beatles fans considering buying this for the first time, should go ahead and do it. I do not think you will be disappointed. Others should be careful. If you are looking for pop, you will not find it here. If you like avant garde, (or better yet, ""Avant garde clue"") - then you are very likely to love having this in your collection."
3,"Good for starting your studies, but lacking depth","Though the flashcards include a lot of information that you need to know, some important areas were light (formulas, ethics, etc.)."
2,ok tool,I recently completed my PMP certification. I bought these as a tool to use. I did not use them as I expected. I found their large size not very practical to carry around as they were attached to a wire ring. It would have made a better tool as individual flash cards. Rita's book on the other hand was essential and helped a great deal.
5,Flashcards for PMP Exam,"These are actually individual Flashcards, not like the book from Rita Mulcahy (which is titled ""Hot Topics: Flashcards for Passing the PMP Exam"") I passed the PMP exam the first time! These flashcards gave me a way to ensure I understood all of the terms and concepts before I took the exam. Yes, I recommend them for anyone looking to pass the exam on their first attempt."
5,Superb,"Their past two albums were dark and not humorous, but they were great as well. This time, they decided to make it a little more funnier. The album sounds like Type O Negative with a little Trent Reznor in ""Ribbons"" and ""More"".I recommend this album because every song is not boring. Even the ones that are acoustic."
3,"More Ribbons, less everything else","More and Ribbons are Sisters songs (and very good ones at that), the rest are post-amphetamine middle-of-the-road rock-and-roll, quite unbecoming for the greatest, gloomiest song-writer ever..."
1,MOCKING THING,"Like any Sisters fan, i bought this cd the first day it was available. I could'nt believe what I heard. To me it sounded like Eldritch was mocking the LA headbangers\metal rockers music that was popular at the time. I consider this CD a personal joke of Eldritch. Not a serious Sisters CD to me & I have'nt played it again since."
2,nooooooooooooooooooooo,"If you liked Floodland, dont get this one. Unless youre a big fan of the electric guitar,this cd is way too ""rockish""! A big disappointment :("
1,waste of money and plastic,I bought this album after 'First Last and Always' and I could hardly belive this was the Sisters of Mercy and not some 80's buttrock band. Terrible album from a great band. The only good thing about this album is the celtic symbol on the cover.
2,Vision Thing,"I gotta Pipe in and say i personally hate this Album. I gave it 2 stars cause it has 'Ribbons' on it, which is possibly their best song. But the rest is just tripe. I don't even know what to say aboot it, but it's just so weak. If you can really put this up and compare it to Floodland or First last and always, you're as loosely based in reality as Eldritch. I love the sisters...but stay away from this one."
3,Cozy Calming Mat Review,I bought this product because my cat loves heating pads. I believe this product is safer than an electric heating pad.It doesn't stay warm for that long.I didn't look at the size when I bought it online. It is very small. Perfect for a little kitten not a normal size house cat.
3,mediocre,"This was a poorly written prep book for chemistry. There are no explanations of how to actually take this exam. The test problems were too easy for the most part, and many of the problems that I got wrong were actually right, the answers in the back were either switched, or the problem was written wrong. The review was ok, but other than that, you should look into another prep book."
5,I want to have this man's adopted babies.,"Roland Dyens is a genius. After watching this I wanted to do nothing but play guitar all the time ever for the rest of my life. His skills as a performer, composer and arranger are astounding. The interviews are also very insightful. Amazing. I love Roland Dyens."
2,Not nearly extensive enough,"This book is thin to the point of looking anemic. I expected more, better information and instead I was rather disappointed. The various regional sections are very poor in content, with only a few creatures per section and the individual articles rarely covering an entire page. The articles themselves are almost devoid of anything besides cursory information. ""Oh? A Kappa has a bowl shaped depression on its head which is filled with water?! That is exactly what wikipedia says!!! Any 5 year old Japanese kid knows that! What about that they taught humans sumo and bone setting? No? PATHETIC!"" This book will only leave you wanted more and feeling like you wasted money, neither of which are good feelings. Save yourself the lost sleep and guilt."
2,Valuable for its diversity.,"This book is valuable for crossing cultural barriers when fishing out folklore related to subversive spirits, however the book is limited in what it offers. Very generalized, you can expect to see sub-headings like: Merman, Kitsune, Kitchen Fairies, Lilith. Too simplistic really to be of much actual research value save for possibly secondary grade school research papers."
2,A book that should have never been written.,"This is a book that is lacking in humor, wit, and empathy. While the topic seemed to promise opportunities for whimsy and a light hearted touch, the author managed to dry out the subject to a degree that it felt like I was reading a high school chemistry book. I regret the purchase."
3,Nothing really exciting,This is a very well organized book and that's the reason it is so easy to read. It is more of a story book and definately not for someone that is looking to learn about demons and spirits in depth.
3,Could have been better,"Ok, first the pro's of this books, it has a lot of demons and beasts and whatnot, classified by the place where you could find them (woods, water, house, psyche, etc.), folklore (tales related to the demons).Bad? Well not really bad, but they could have picked up some more interesting demons and spirits, the descriptions are sometimes too short or too vague. Anyway, I was expecting more of this book."
5,Carol and Dinah Mack score!,"Nearly every demon of significance is included in this magnificent book. Some might complain that the book is not worth the time seeing as how the descriptions only average about a page and a half; but I argue that this book is simply a starting point. If this book wets your appetite for things demonic, as it did for me, then you will find the six page bibliography quite helpful (and interesting!).The demons are all neatly categorized into six sections. They are as follows.1. Water2. Mountain3. Forest4. Desert5. Domicile6. PsycheThe writing is clear and precise, but not boring. I very much suggest this book to anyone with an interest in the subject. But do note that this is a book of demonology--not demonolatry. If you're looking for books on demonolatry go check the New Age section."
5,A nice read with a good mix of creatures,It is a pretty good book I am not good with reviews but here goes. I wish there was more pages with more creatures but what it does have is nice it tell you about what the creature looks like how to spot it and where and how to protect your self from it there are some creatures in here I have never even heard of some that dwell within you.I am glad I bought it and if you do enjoy.
5,Well Done!,"This book was very interesting in that it did not give the typical viewpoint of this subject. More to the point, given the subject matter, the reader did not feel like he/she was sneaking illicit reading material -- there was no judgement or slant to the author's viewpoint. As for the writing style itself, it was clear, comprehensive (but not to the point of ad nauseum), and easy to read. I would recommend this book for those whose curiousities may be like mine -- a little out of the ordinary."
4,Leave Your Butterfly Net At Home ~ In Search Of The Supernatural,"A delightful field guide for the would-be spirit chaser in training. While this is primarily a reference book, it goes beyond most books of this genre by giving the reader more than just a brief dictionary type description of the creature being discussed.Each entry begins with a 'Introduction/Description' of what we're dealing with followed by a 'Lore' section containing encounter stories and ends with the all important 'Disarming & Dispelling Techniques.' The organizational skills of the authors are excellent and highly original. I appreciate the manner in which they divided these ""Subversive Spirits"" into different geographical locations and climatic conditions (Water - Mountain - Forest - Desert) and distinquishes between inner and outer realities (domicile - psyche).All in all a highly enjoyable and informative read."
3,a good guide,"This was a good read, and has a wide variety of demons and spirits, taken from myths, legends, and other sources, explained clearly.It doesnt go into that much detail, but does have good advice to protect you from the numerous demons all around us.All and all a good book to have."
5,Gift,For my sister. She lived in a fairly haunted part of Scotland and needed some guidance on the spooky things that were happening in that house.
4,Great book and easy to read,"This book is a great work from Carol Mack. It presents, in a really easy way to understand, every subversive spirit. A whole lot of pictures to help your imagination. Comprehension of this book is at a 6th grader level. TRUE satanists and pagans should read it."
4,Why would anyone want to learn how to conjure these demons!?,"I read this book from a friend and found it very interesting, and I decided to purchase a copy of my own. I have one question, after eading the other following reviews. Why would anyone want to know how to conjure or summon these creatures!? I'm very christian, but I still studied this book. Whoever complains about how the book doesn't contain any information on how to summon, they need to see a psychiatrist or a priest......"
3,Okay,This book was okay. I have read better. It was very interesting. Not factual but interesting...
3,Does Cover Some But Not Most Demons,"This is a good book which covers the very basic of some history on demons, but not really much. As a Demonologist the world of paranormal and demons are rather ""huge"" right now and this would not teach or help those looking for answers about demons. I read this book and felt it could of been better with the research and more on the demons in different culturs such as in my own book Devils and Demonology in the 21st century. Thumbs down on this book, sorry.Katie BoydAuthor of Devils & Demonology In the 21st Century"
1,just a story book,This book is nothing more than a collection of mythology which have very little basis in reality. If your looking to expand your knowledge of demons this is not the book for you. Some entertainment value though!
2,Nothing Special,"I confess it is partly my fault; I was expecting an encyclopaedic book that would provide information that was not of an exoteric nature. This book, I am sure, would be pleasant for those wishing to study the mythologies of various cultures. Most of the information was more of a story-telling nature. It is very cute and amusing and would probably interest an elementary school student who has a fascination with the morbid."
4,Fun with Demons!,"This book should be on Buffy's required reading list! :-) It's a great tome for people looking for some humor mixed in with their demonology. At a page or two on each spirit, it doesn't go into a whole lot of depth, but it's a great overview and a good launching platform for more serious research. The whole approach of a field guide that takes the legends at face value (and even recommends warding and dispelling techniques) is a great way to discuss all types of creatures without making pronouncements on which ones are ""real"". Someone looking for a serious and deep delving into this sort of topic may wish to look elsewhere, but for a high level view of demons in mythology with a dash of humor thrown in, this book can't be topped!"
3,Weaker book in Postmodern Encounters series,"I love the Postmodern Encounters series. That said, this particular title was a little disappointing. Though interesting, intelligent, and even funny, I was let down by it and thought it would offer more. It really should be called ""Epistemology and the Internet."" I think this idea of mixing Plato w/ the Internet SOUNDED good at the time, but the execution here is questionable. There are insights in this book, but not as many as other Postmodern Encounters titles. It's worth reading for its own sake (it's short and lucidly written) but falls short of the mark in my view. Basically the author is asserting a shift from knowledge-for-its-own-sake to knowledge-as-commodity. But he could have gone into greater and better detail about the Internet more, its effect on culture, society, and thought, and how the Internet generation (Millenials, Gen Y, Gen Next) can connect with Plato and ancient Greek thought in general."
4,Can He Fit In?,"""The Day Sheep Showed Up"" may not become one of your family favorites, but it is a true beginning reader with a pleasant story and true beginning vocabulary. A friendly group of farm animals discover there is a new animal in their farmyard. They make observations and ask questions trying to figure out what kind of animal 'Sheep' is, and how he is alike or different from each of them. In the end they all play together and decide they are not so different from eachother after all. The story flows easily. The illustrations are engaging. This is a good beginning book for young animal lovers. We like it!"
3,These do not burn as well as the esbit tablets,"I bought the esbit stove and tablets and was very impressed with how well they worked. I bought these tablets because they are much cheaper than the esbit ones. However, I notice that these are not as efficient as the esbit tablets, and they leave behind a messy black shield. When I try to blow them out, I end up blowing the black cotton-candy-like shield all over the place. The esbit tablets burn clean."
5,Works great,"I tried these as a replacement for Esbit in my model steam engine, you can't beat the $, works great!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"Price is right on these. They are ok, but they are not individually sealed. They don't really last that long and leave a black residue after they burn."
5,It just makes you wanna be there!,"What a unique book! At times the writing flows just like poetry, ....""A forest thick with pine and poplar was interrupted only by the ribbon of road and clearings of shimmering lakes..."" and other times it feels like a talking about fish stories with a friend in a local cafe...""My trusty rod and reel were packed in the trunk, just in case."" If you've never been to Minnesota, or don't have a concept of what 'Small Town Minnesota Nice' really is, then pick up this book. And if you've ever visited a small town in Minnesota, or anywhere, read this book to feel welcomed back again! I truly couldn't put it down from Argyle to Zumbro Falls!"
3,High Energy Country Boogie,"Do not be fooled! Despite the ""Sun"" label and what looks to be the original Sam Phillips logo, these are not recordings from the 1950's. That said, this is a very good collection, especially for the price. LaBeef has a big deep booming voice and his back up band attacks the set with alot of energy. There is nothing particularly original here and a few of these covers, such as Me and Bobbie McGee, have been done much better by other artists, but you look at this guy and you wonder if maybe Elvis might have ended up like this, if he had lived."
3,Go Texas!,"Well, I am sure that it is a great DVD for those who like the zest and bigness of it all, I intend to keep it. Though I like Texas and its people, (especially my gransons), this DVD was just a bit big for me.Why did I buy it? I was actually looking for a song, and bought four DVDs before I found it. So! Lucky me, I get to expand my borders of appreciation. I will just have to learn to love it.Mickey Thorne"
5,Great product,Fits my 2 D cell maglite perfectly. I mounted these on the b pillar of my truck with different hardware than what came with the kit.
4,Great clips but they need to be as tough as their flashlights!,"Hi folks,These clips are great and do exactly what they describe. It takes a hefty pull to get the flashlight out when using both mounts and that's exactly what you want. I would warn fellow knuckle draggers like myself, that when the flashlight is removed from it's clips, the clips can be broken with a bit of pressure in the wrong direction. I'd recommend installing the clips where there isn't a chance of them being rubbed or pushed up against by anything else.I installed my clips near the stickshift of a Jeep Wrangler on the passenger side and I've ended up going through 3 sets in 11 years. As far as I know, there's nothing else out there that's as cheap or as good so I'll stick with them but wanted to offer up some placement advice.Cheers,NORCALROOTS"
2,They broke.,"I was using these to hold my flashlight in my car, and they broke. Just in the course of usage, not in a car wreck or anything. I was using them to hold the light horizontally, so maybe a vertical position mounted on a wall would work better, but even for that I would rather make something myself than buy these."
5,Works as Intended,"At first glance, I thought these brackets were going to be cheap and flimsy. They are quite the contrary. They hold my flashlights with a Kung Fu GI Joe grip! I love how sturdy they feel.Can't go wrong with these brackets. Just make sure you tie them into solid blocking in your wall (aka your studs). Otherwise, you may rip a patch of your drywall out of the wall when lifting your flashlight out."
4,Keeps my Flashlight handy...,"I have a set of these mounting brackets bolted to my garage workbench and can always count on finding my Maglite flashlight just where I left it - safe and secure. The plastic seems a bit fragile, but in the two years that I have used them, I have never had a failure. The flashlight securely snaps into place and is not in danger of falling out.If I were to do it again, I'd buy a set of these in a minute. It functions well and does the job for which it was intended."
4,Keeping a light handy,"Some reviewers disparage these clips because they are plastic. I had to look closely at them to make sure they were plastic since they feel very sturdy to me. I attached them to the frame of my futon in a couple of minutes and now feel better knowing that I have a light handy without even having to get out of bed. I plan to get another set, or two, to mount a light near the garage door and maybe even in my SUV."
3,They Work....,"After buying these as a replacement for an old pair I had that broke a while ago. I was very skeptical due to the bad reviews. But I was sick of my flashlight not being available at the garage door where I originally placed the clips. So I plunked down my money, re-installed the brackets and now very carefully (knowing how they will break again) put my maglite in place and remove just as carefully. Buyer beware but still a useful tool."
4,Holds many more than just Mags,"Product works as advertised, while plastic they are quite solid in construction. Needed to mount a mag to the garage wall...perfect solution."
2,Really liked them until they broke...,"Not much I can say about them. I was excited to finally have a place for my maglite in my class B RV, but sadly within the first couple of times that I removed the light while at a campsite, one clip broke. Having said that, I'm here to buy another set since they are inexpensive enough.Update - after a little more searching, I decided not to go with these again. I'll spend a few more dollars on these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006NOC8Q6/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&smid;=A30CMYG2VPLUO6"
1,brackets,"I guess these were not intended for use in cold climates. Using with a Maglite 3cell light,between 20 and 40 degrees, about the third time, they broke."
2,Broke easily and quickly...,"I have mine mounted in my vehicle as well for offroading and it is mounted to the body of the vehicle on the driver side pillar and within 2 weeks one side broke off and I was in the motion of pulling the light out so it was not getting slammed into it or anything. My father was in the vehicle as I was removing the light to show him and once it broke while I was removing it my dad's first response was, ""well that's a crappy clip"". I am going to purchase it once more and maybe see if the second will last longer and if so I will edit my opinion."
3,Flimsy,"I bought this and put it on my flashlight to try it out. When I took it off to install, both the brackets broke. Sadly, the QuickFist clamps don't fit my application. So I just ordered anther set."
5,great Product,This is my second set of these mounts. Just as you would expect and they hold the flashlight very tight.
5,Can't go wrong,"I had these installed on the dash of my old SUV - stupid me! Forgot to take them off when I sold the car! When you drive at night, especially in snowy, blizzard conditions, you don't want to be fumbling for your 4d MagLite when something happens! My Mag Flashlight has come in handy so many times I recommend everyone to have one within hands reach ""just in case"". For this price, you can't go wrong!! Seen it some stores for almost 4x this price!!"
1,The maglight flashlight mounting clamp,I was very dissappointed with this item. Didn't last a day. The Streamlight Adjust-a-Clamp is VASTLY superior. Stainless steel construction and it's CHEAPER too. My current Streamlight set has been in heavy constant use in my truck for over 15 years. The rubber has worn off a few times but it STILL HOLDS MY FLASHLIGHT! Customers who were unhappy with the MAG instrument product should check out the Streamlight clamps.
5,Mag light holder for the wll,Excellent purchase. Now I always know where my flash light is and you can put it anywhere in a convenient place and have it at your access ub case if blackouts.
4,Handy product,"These were a replacement for a set I had bought years ago and one had broken.I really like these brackets as they allow me to keep my Mag lite flashlight in a conspicuous spot and allow easy removal when needed.My only concern is that they do break after a couple of years. I'd like to see a softer more flexible plastic used in their construction, thus ensuring a longer lasting product.Of course with the reasonable price I feel they are still a good buy."
5,Fantastic,Works and looks good in my truck. I mounted this in the back so I always have it when needed
4,Flashlight Bracket,Now these Brackets are worth the cost . I used them to mount my 4D size Maglight on my crash bar of my Harley . Have not had any issues and I ride all over the place . Just zip tied them on and cliped in flashlight.
3,Where is My Flashlight?,"Always know where your flashlight is with these handy clips. Works on most ""D"" cell flashlights in either the horizontal or vertical position. One clip is sufficient for a 2-cell flashlight. I keep one one the wall by the garage door so I always know where the flashlight is. It would work equally well in a car, truck, boat, or camper. I am thinking about mounting one on my bike handlebars :)"
1,Too weak,"I bought one of these several years ago and it broke within a couple of months. A couple of months ago I decided to try again, within 3 weeks it was broken, Never Again."
5,DAC Original Outlaw,Original Outlaw is true David Allan Coe. This CD is full of great songs and a good addition to any DAC collection.
2,It's OK,Not as good as DAC's other works. But it's all about tatse. I would look else where for some of his other works.
5,DAC,"Took me a few times listening to it, but quickly became one of my favorites, If you DAC, you'll love this album."
3,Good yoga mat bag - unless you have a Manduka mat,"When I purchased this bag, I had your run-of-the-mill yoga mat, and it fit just fine with room to spare for towels, etc. Then I purchased a Manduka mat (that I love!), which is wider than your average mat. This bag is not long enough to fit my Manduka mat in. :-("
5,Parrot works great with the IPhone G3 for Verizon,"The installation of the Parrot was easy after getting the optional cable for a '09 Charger. It's great how it uses the car stereo even with the stereo turned off. When a call comes in it mutes the music then uses the volume set by the Parrot, not the volume the music was set to. This bluetooth and a Garmin GPS was way cheaper than the factor options for these simple two things (gps/bluetooth option is over $2k while it costs under $400 to add these yourself. Can you say RIPOFF!)."
3,Good Product but poor support,I bought 2 of these devices one worked fine and the other is faulty . Unfortunately parrot's technical support is very very slow to respond.. I wait patiently. If both worked I would have given 4-5 star rating
3,immature technology,"I've had the CK3100 for a month now and it still bothers me that the basic ergonomics are not that good. There is no way to control the volume using your car stereo system, which I imagined would be available. Instead the 3100 has it's own amplifier with no hard controls and only rudimentary software control over volume - the system voice is usually way too loud with an ear splitting beep after the ""say a command"" message. And once you've cranked the callers volume all the way up via a 6 segment LED readout - that's it, too bad if the caller speaks quietly or there's a lot of road noise. No last call redial is also a pain. A basic intro to Bluetooth for the car, but that's it. Better for answering calls than making calls."
3,still trying,I bought one for my company truck. The first one did not work at all. The second one worked great for about two weeks then the display quit. I like the concept and it is user friendly (then it works). I'll try one more before I give up on this model.
4,Well done,Once you have this product it's very difficult to imagine driving without it. It works quite well. Installation can be a challenge if your car has a complex stereo system. I paid $80 for a special plug and play wiring harness and $80 to have it installed. Well worth it.
3,Adequate for the money,"Despite the cheaply made buttons, this unit is adequate for the money I paid, which was about $115 on Amazon. I drive a convertible sports car and I always have the top down (God Bless Las Vegas weather!). Except for one occasion, most persons with whom I speak have no trouble hearing me, even on the freeway -- I think the one time it was difficult to hear me was because of a weak signal. I have no trouble at all hearing whoever is calling because their voice goes though my car stereo. However, because I have a BOSE, I had to pay an extra $50 for installation at Fry's -- for a total of $150. Total investment: $265. I wouldn't recommend the unit if you had to pay more."
2,Poor quality and customer service,My CK-3100 lasted for 14 months before the brain module went out. The unit will not shut off and remains on with the ignition shut off. The face plate reads Good Bye and will not reset. I have discovered that I am not the only one with this problem. I have tried to contact the company twice. I have received case numbers each time. Still no reply to my requests. I am very disappointed with their support.
2,Other drivers here a lot of background noise,"I read a lot of positive reviews before buying, but am disappointed. My first unit didn't save any of my settings so the dealer replaced it. The second unit works great if the person I'm calling is on a land line. If they are also using a handsfree phone while driving they complain of very loud background noise and I have a very hard time hearing them (thier voices seem to be muted even at full volume). All in all I was better off with my old Jabba that clipped to the visor. I would advise you not buy Parrot."
2,Weak and Tragic,"Not great LeCarre, but perhaps it is a good looking glass hold up to our own Cold War policy."
1,Worst spy book I have ever read.,"This whole book is absolutely pointless. All that happens is the individuals train up a spy to go into Soviet territory and then they leave him. Big Story!! I could write that! To me it is not believable or relevant or anything. Maybe this is the way that it really is or something, but I cannot even believe that, for one simple reason: money. A government cannot waste money like that on risking security breaches, it is just not feasible"
1,"Looking Glass War, Le Carré",This was so bad we stopped watching halfway through. There was minimal resemblance to the book. Violence and sex were added gratuitously. This film was a far cry from the other beautifully done Le Carré films/mini-series.
1,Terrible!Don't know why writing such ridiculous book!?,"Very ridiculous and tasteless story, but might be the first book with gay complex description, very obscure but if you read carefully, you would get the message. Anyway, it got nothing to do with the whole book. A 100% BOMB!"
4,Solid early le Carre,"While not as polished as some of his later work, especially the ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"", ""Honourable Schoolboy"", ""Smiley's People"" trilogy, this book does a pretty good job examining some of the themes that have characterized le Carre's work over the years (loyalty, betrayal, disillusionment). I can only assume the negative reviewers were expecting something more in the vein of James Bond."
4,Classic Le Carre,"I had to write due to the negative reviews being placed. While the story line itself may seem a little bit unfeasible, it very often is more closely aligned to governments than we think. Some argue that a government would not do that to one of its' men, however the U.S. sort of did that in the Bay of Pigs. I won't even go into Vietnam! Basically this is typical le Carre. The thing that keeps me coming back is that he never ends things the way you want. You don't get a warm feeling like with Clancy. Real Life-I love it."
3,very slow moving,"No, I wasn't looking for something in the James Bond vein, but Le Carre always seems to be wishing he's writing in a different genre. The unrelievedly mournful tone of conversations and all personal encounters is not only a little wearing, but also unrealistic - people just aren't this humorless in real life...or are they?"
2,Heavy handed,"A bit overbearing (when not mawkish) is the sign of this poetry. It is not up to the best of what Graham can do. Her writing is always weighty, and in that mode can work wonders but not-- for the most part-- here. I'm afraid reputation has taken her professional reviewers into praises unwarranted and undeserved. The metaphysics doesn't reach; the reality doesn't call; the experiences don't tell-- the poetry doesn't work. We need the best of poetry for our lives, and with the devestation of the poetic landscape by the langpo people and the New York School and the midwestern inability to go beyond paltry, it is unfortunate that Graham has not come through for us in this book."
4,Freedom and Democracy,"This is an excellent translation of Beccaria's masterwork. The phrasing is clear and unaffected; and the format is pleasant and well-disposed. An Essay on Crimes and Punishments is one of the greatest treatises in the democratic tradition, a testament to human freedom and social justice. For students of law or political theory (of which I am one) this is an excellent account of some of the fundamental principles of democratic society and jurisprudence. Anyone who holds public office should be forced to read this book at gunpoint."
4,Law with Human Faces,"Originally published in 1764 anonymously,this essay is a lucid sprit of laws by a young enlightened Italian.His rational argument is based on humanism with anti-clerical and anti-despotic tendencies,which is so convincing and has been proved influential on the reformist movements. Before reading this work, I was nearly ignorant of the ancien regime realities.Thanks to it,the situations and struggles of people in those days have been more clearly revealed to me."
3,"An excellent book, but needs an update.","This is an excellent book, that we used as a supplement in our electronic engineering undergrad course (1st year, freshman, mid-'90s). This was quite state-of-the-art in the 1990s, with discussions on the 32-bit 68xxx microprocessors. But, come on, this is 2011, and we have 32-bit ARM processors in watches measuring 100mW of power. This is the age of Arduinos, TI Launchpads, 16-bit microcontrollers retailing for less than $1... this book's later sections feel a little outdated. However, the basics are still sound. It's the best reference book a beginning electrical engineer can have and keep her interest in the subject for a lifetime."
1,An advanced book,"This book may be an excellent book for the electrical engineer, but not for the average ""learn-it-on-your-own"" person. It offers lots of questions in the text, but no answers. Without an instructor who actually cares about teaching, I would not recommend this book."
1,Worst Electronics Book for Beginners,"Those peoples who give this book four or five starts are people who already understands electronics. But very few beginners buy and use this book and so there are very few reviews from them who would give this book one or two stars. For a beginner, this book is very confusing and lacks examples and exercises with answers."
4,A good book that covers all your needs,As an Electronics student I found this book both interesting and useful. There is enough depthn to get slightly involved. I found this book a great help for my first year studies.I recomend this book for all first year degree students.(in electronics)
3,excellent text.. but well outdated,excellent text.. but a lot of the information is outdated... it serves as a good stepping stone into the present... the newer engineers aren't exposed to some of the primitive technologies... which in my mind is a disadvantage...
2,"Perhaps a good reference, but definitely not a learningt textbook","Well, If u are new in electronics (real electronics, say at least u know how a transistor works), then maybe u will understand the book,otherwise, DON'T GET ITtry some easier books first, such as some books start with ""Fundamental of Electrical engineering""because horowitz's explanation is reli.....sucks.u can see sth like ""That's easy to calculate"" usually (obviously not that easy). or even he omitted the derive of formulas.In conclusion, dun try to learn from this book. It will only make more questions in your mind.Perhaps, its a good reference, bcz there are relireli lots of circuit example. But well, not my level."
5,As already mentioned: The Electronics Bible,"I'm an undergraduate student in physics and electronic engineering. Although it hasn't been used as a textbook in my engineering course, it was used as the textbook for both second and third year electronics courses in my physics course. At any rate, it is regarded as the ""Bible"" of reference texts. Be aware that it is in reality a reference - although it can be used to learn electronics, there are other books that are probably more appropriate. However, for anyone between decent electronics enthusiast and professional electronic engineer, this is an indispensable tool, and I recommend it to anyone who considers themselves in this category. It has proved its worth over and over again (I purchased my copy in 1992, and despite its 10 year age, it is still highly relevant and useful). I anticipate the next version (should there be one) with great eagerness. This is one book that I couldn't be apathetic about reviewing. BUY IT!"
5,Good all around,"Not clear if it's good for beginners. One thing to keep in mind if you are, is to think and not learn passively. I recommend you order this book and see if it suits you, since the return policy is in place for precisely reasons like this."
2,"Still excellent, but old in the tooth, and preposterously overpriced","Well, I guess it's been a while since I've been a college student. I'm a crusty old amateur radio hobbyist now, and all college texts seem to have ridiculous prices. This book used to be the best reference I've ever seen on basic electronics for non-EE's, and even for non-engineers. It's not much of a cookbook - instead, it will make you sit down and work through the fundamentals of the circuits you're designing or adapting. The second ed. is getting long in the tooth and it's preposterously overpriced. Another big drawback is that there are no answers to the (otherwise excellent) exercises, and you have to pay out again to get answers to the questions you're not sure about. It will be interesting to see what the 3rd ed. looks like. Maybe I'll start a web site and publish the answers online."
2,The Art of Electronics,"This text is good as a overview of circuits and designs for an experienced engineer, providing a wide variety of examples. However, it often lacks explanations and discussion on the theory behind the design examples, which makes it very difficult to understand for a novice. Without a decent background in circuit components and their functions, this text will leave you with many unanswered questions."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Being a mechanical engineer by training and working in an automation environment, I found myself asking questions that electrical engineers take for granted. I called one of my professors and asked her for advice on a reference book that will bring me up to speed. She recommended this book and having used it at least 2-3 times a week since I recieved it, I consider it a great investment! While I agree with some of the previous reviewers remarks on the quality of the index, the judicious use of tabs, post-its and writing in the margins allows me to cope with this deficiency. The major impact this book has on my professional life is it allows me to ask an ""intelligent"" question to an electrical engineer which is focused to the task at hand. This is done without going thru peripheral theory and application explanations of which this book does an excellent job."
4,An electronic treasure,"Simply, it is an electronic treasure, it covers a very wide range of electronics plus a very helpful circuits, but it has one disadvantage, that is, the excercises inside the book, they must be solved in the end of the book just to be sure that you are doing well with the book. Except that it is a great reachy book."
3,"Helpful? Reference, yes. Teaching/learning, no.","I've used this book for two quarters at ohio university in physics 272 and 273. Other than the fact that the lab courses doen't do much in the way of actual teaching, this text and it's sarcasm is awful.It does ask a lot of questions, but as a teaching text for an introductory set of labs, it is terrible. You may think I'm just too stupid to benefit from sarcastic questions with no material in the text to answer them, but if that is the case, you are probably some nerd type that knows very little in the way of education.I'll be selling this set of texts, which is unusual, since as a teacher, I generally keep all my texts for future reference (even my introduction to particle physics by Das, and my quantum mechanics text by Ira Levine)...save money and use google, or wikipedia you will find more detailed answers."
2,"No es un libro para poder entenderlo , da por entendido demasiado detalles. No sirve como libro de texto.",Este libro trate de leerlo varias veces pero como libro para entender electronica no sirve.Da por obvio muchas cosas que no lo son para el que esta aprendiendo.Lo empece con mucho entusiasmo y lo deje de lado a pesar de haber costado unos buenos dolares.lu3eec
5,The best text on Electronic *design* available,"This book shows you what to do with your engineering degree. If you encountered it in school, then you already know what I mean. If you didn't, then this book will transform your education from a mass of unrelated facts into a working technical knowledge. Many other fine books exist to teach electronic circuit analysis, but this is should be your first and foremost reference on electronic design."
5,A Summary of the Undergraduate Electrical Engineering Curric,"This book is an excellent desk reference for review of electrical engineering and electronics. It is very brief and summarizes a lot of material in one book. However, this not a book you can read with no background knowledge in electronics. If you have decent knowledge on electronics and engineering, this book can help you recall much information that you forgot and/or introduce you to many devices and concepts that you may have never come across. It's a great handy shelf reference."
4,"Excellent reference, but getting dated...",The Art Of Electronics combines a lot of practical information about electronics that makes it a very useful reference text. I just wish they would update it. A 2007 version would probably get 5 stars.
5,An Encyclopedia for a cheap Textbook price!!,"I bought the first edition and put my hand on this second edition as soon as it was published.Each paragraph asks significant amount of time in the beginning, but it's worth it.You'll find yourself analyzing virtually all the circuit that you come across!My major is chemistry, but I have fixed all sorts of electronic appliances including my 27"" TV, a control circuit for the huge analytical instruments that I had to operate at school, and so forth, and so forth...Now I had two copies of the first edition, one of which became wore the age and gone. The remaining first edition has all the traces of my understanding and they're being transferred to the second edition that I have.Of course I bought two copies of the second edition for the same purpose. You may want to sleep over it.Just don't give up in the beginning as it reads really difficult in the first place. But it would pick up speed.It's just amazing!!"
4,"not for novices, but very good","This is an extremely dense book; it covers linear components in one chapter, whereas most textbooks take three. It often requires staring at a circuit, thinking about it in different ways, until you finally see it ""their way"" and what they are saying makes sense. Electronics is very similar to physics, and this books mirrors that approach by introducing simple approximations first, then teaching you where the simple models break down and you have to employ a second approximation, and so on."
5,Reference Bible,This is an essential reference for anyone in engineering or electronics. A must have addition to any reference library.
5,The best desktop reference book available!,Well worth the cover price.All the information that you never seem to be able to accurately remember.
4,A gem that needs polishing,"Perhaps it is rare to review a book after 20 years of owning the 1st and then the 2nd edition. This is an invaluable book for the practicing engineer or inventor or hobbyist. It eliminates much theoretical background and gets to practical implementation. You will find a wealth of practical tips that you will never find in standard engineering textbooks. This is a reference book that I have used for many years. However I agree with the last reviewer that it is in dire need of an update. Needless to say there are 10+ years of advancing technology some of which would be valuable to included. It is still quite a useful book however. At this point, if you are a perspective buyer you may want to wait for an update."
1,Tree Killer,"This book is way overated. Its way-out, wacky treament of electronics could definitely not be that of any well thought-of engineer. It's frankly just a bunch of goofy unsystematic mumbo-jumbo by some over-educated self-proclaimed ""physicists."" So imagine my surprise when I read a translation of this in Russian. I think the whole world must have been duped. Do yourself a favor. Go read the Smith book (see my other reviews) and avoid this one like the plague.Update: This text is the academic literary equivalent of Sanjaya Malakar from Idol. One suspects that its ecstatic fans must be born-dupes who have finally found someone who will deceive and even lie to them in just the right way."
3,confused,"To start with: I have not read ""The art of electronics"" but, since I would like to buy a book providing answers to many practical questions, I was wondering whether this would be of help. And so I read the customers comments. And after having read these I was left puzzled and confused. I still do not know what the target group is or whether I will find the sort of information I need. Most comments were very positive, but two were very negative. There does not seem to be an in-between. Either you love it or you hate it. Why is that so? I was also surprised by the fact that all comments were of a recent date, whereas the book is ten years old. My question to Amazon: would it not be possible to attach a few pages of the book as an example. It would be helpful to build my own impression. P.S. I gave the book a three star ""neutral"" rating because I had to fill in that field."
5,Very good reading,"So much more intricate than at first glance. If you grow weary of the usual themes of the Asian-American experience, you will find this collection remarkable in its originality, especially considering the first story was written in 1948. A wonderful book to read."
3,Cheesy French classic with English subtitles,"I'm confused about the other reviews, because this movie DID have English subtitles. It's '70s humor, pretty dated and cheesy, but fun for a shot of French pop culture. If you're interested in France, ""Les Bronzés"" is essential to your cultural literacy. I hope the original ""Les Bronzés"" becomes available in the U.S. -- this one is the sequel.I can't believe this is the same director who made the brilliant ""Ridicule,"" but it was enjoyable to see his early hit."
5,FABULOUS!,"Completely hilarious... I only wish they'd release it with subtitles; I speak French pretty fluently, but there were a few jokes that went a little over my head..."
2,dated,"this is apparently a classic in France, but there are much better French farces, especially those by francis veber, such as the dinner game"
2,Scratching My Head,"All in all a great movie...... If I understood what they were saying. I speak French ok, but was hoping to get subtitles. You will NOT find subtitles. Disregard what other reviews you have read."
1,Pathetic,"I sent this to my nephew for his 7th birthday. Less than a week later he brought it with him when he came to visit. It was THE cheapest thing I have ever seen in my life. The entire kit should be available at the dollar store, if that gives you any idea of how bad it is. You can't feel any sensation whatsoever with the so-called buzzer, the fake vomit was about the size of a silver dollar. It should be called fake spit. I could go on and on, but why bother. Please don't waste your money. That's all I can say."
1,Not good. Buyer beware.,"We bought this for my 8 year-old daughter's birthday. She aspires to be a ""prankster"", and had had her eye on this kit for a long time. For the price, I expected something ... better. The fake vomit is about 1.5"" diameter, totally clear. Is it just me, or does anyone else expect the fake vomit to be a healthy brown splat of a thing??? None of the water tricks really work. The dollar bill trick is ridiculous: the string is so short, you really have no hope of being able to hide and trick anybody. The snake-popping-out-of-the-can thing is ANEMIC, that's the only word for it. I know that these are cheesy tricks, and maybe I expected too much -- but then, maybe they shouldn't be charging $[...] for it. Total junk."
1,Rip Off,"I ordered this prank kit for my grandson who was very disappointed with the quality. Most of the items were miniature size. I didn't expect top quality, but certainly expected better than what I received."
4,I liked it,It is the first book I have read about the French Revolution. It was easy to read and seemed like a good start on reading about this subejct.
2,In serious need of an editor,"This book is shot through with factual errors, typographical mistakes, and mangled syntax. Is the art of editing dead?If you already know some naval history, you'll find it a somewhat entertaining light read and maybe enjoy the attempt to draw a sweeping picture of British naval history from galleons to Exocet missiles. Even when the author is wrong -- as he often is -- he might make you think about something in a new way.If you know nothing of naval history, the high frequency of serious factual errors and simple misspellings make this book a very poor place to start. How can you use a bibliography in which a title or author's name is likely to be misspelled?"
4,Good Overview of the Royal Navy,"I thought this was a well-written work that described how the Royal Navy developed, changed and finally went into decline. Troublesome were the small errors I found in areas I knew something about. That led me to believe that in areas I was not familiar with there were additional errors. None of the errors were critical to the story, but annoying nevertheless. For example, Theodore Roosevelt was never Secretary of the Navy; he was the assistant secretary. Good fact checking would have caught this error."
1,Don't bother buying this book,"I have never seen a book so full of factual errors as this one. There are better books out there on this subject - don't waste your money.Incidentally, Herman is a well-known white supremacist. Potential customers should keep this in mind (even if they don't have a problem with it)."
1,How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World,"I had received this book, (and is not the first time), withthe paper cut as with and hand saw."
4,"Great book, Great Thesus, but not a page turner","Arthur Herman's volume give you more info about the development of the Royal Navy than you can shake a stick at. It is as complete a volume as you can have on what was one of the greatest military groups in history.Strangely enough it wasn't a page turner for me and I ended up reading it over a month rather than finishing in a week or less as I normally do. It was good, interesting and informative but it wasn't all consuming. In small doses it was just the right taste.The relevance of the book becomes plain as he points out that once France was defeated utterly it was the presence of the Royal Navy run by an ethical society that kept the peace. It was when the Navy allowed itself to be rivaled (by the Germans) or restricted by treaty (in the 20's) that gave the green light for dictators to feel free to rise. It is a lesson well learned."
3,One of the worst proofed books I have ever seen,When I first started reading the book I found it very enjoyable but then I started noticing the typos and it became so distracting that I found myself concentrating more on them than the narrative. I found 26 typos between pages 147 and 511.ExamplesPage 389a lieutenant (to) steerPage 282the most powerful political player (in)Southeast AsiaPage 377On and off for the better (part) of a decadePage 458including Coles and Childer's own son ?? Two men have one son??
1,Useless,"This book has more than 600 pages.To the worst defeat of the British Navy in history, the siege of Cartagena, the author devotes exactly 6 lines."
4,Nice read but battles descriptions slightly short,Saw this book off the shelf and decided to get it due to its interesting title. The book covers from San Juan de Ulloa right up to the Falklands War and beyond. Reading is straightforward and enjoyable. Content are generally well covered with both on-shore and off-shore history well described. However some battles are too skimpy on details whereas some like the San Juan are covered more.Overall a good book for reading on the British Royal navy. For more details on any specific events will need to specifically hunt for some other books that are more dedicated.
3,Functional watch with a quirk,"This watch is a good value for a day-to-day watch that's functional. The numbers on the face are easy to read, and the watch looks basic, but almost plate metal (cheap). About a month into it, I noticed that the pin was out, not by my doing, but when this happens, the watch stops completely. It's now happened twice. However, once the pin is pushed back in, the watch starts again. It's too early to tell whether this is going to be an ongoing situation, else the rating would be lower."
3,Just ok.,The original versions with just Jerry Lee are better. I had always thought that the other singer was Charlie Rich. They were both with Sun Records at one time. Chrile Rich sounded like Elvis back then.
1,What's The Point?,"It's a shame that these great Jerry Lee Lewis tracks were tampered with by adding an Elvis imitator. I can't see how anyone could be fooled into believing that these are duets with Presley. It is particularly absurd that the voice is that of the Elvis in the seventies with early Jerry Lee.This disc is just a novelty. If you're a Jerry Lee completist, you'd want to have it, but I'd recommend that you buy any and every other CD of his before you get this one."
5,the movielife's best,"Although i love virtually everything that the movielife put out, this cd remains my favorite. i have been listening to this since it came out (thats over 3 years). it really is that good. this cd is packed with energy, but still is able to keep its pop sensibility. this came before the movielife moved on to bigger things (drive thru records) so it still has that natural, stripped down feel. its not overproduced, it just plain rocks. if you listen to punk, hardcore, pop-punk, or just plain rock you should definetly buy this cd. the movielife was a great band and it was hard to see them go."
4,Absolutely incredible!,"I heard this band for the first time on the Aversion Online website, and I was hooked from the note. I bought the disc, and was very pleasantly surprised. It is very poppy punk, but with much more of an Emo edge to it than most of the other bands out there, and there are some hardcore and even oi parts thrown in throughout. This cd is full of emotional lyrics, beautiful singing, catchy hooks, and killer choruses, so much so that you physically are unable to stop listening. I normally listen to death and black metal, and even I love this album, so i seriously doubt that anyone who considers themselves to be a music fan willl be disapointed by this. My one and only complaint is the length...12 songs in 26 minutes...could've been a bit longer, especially considering the price tag. But, this should not be a factor in anyone's decision process. Get this disc or miss out on something wonderful!"
4,"Good, but NOT EMO","I picked up this cd a while ago, and i loved how they combine pop/punk with melodic hardcore (although the best band to do that is Glasseater), and i was happy cuz there wasnt a trace of emo in it. but now that they are on Drive-thru, they sound like that ... band NFG. so if you like good fun music, pick up this cd, and if you like the ... bands on drivethru, pick up ...has a gambling problem"
1,Disappointment,I was really excited to get this order and waited for 2 weeks & then i got an e-mail that the company had cancelled my order! very disappointed....
2,"More of a jab at small churches, approaches won't work.","I was really disappointed. The author is obviously qualified, but it is interesting that he has been involved in so many denomonations (7) in his own youth ministry. I sense that he has had bad experiences with small churches and has unresolved issues. There are many jabs at them throughout the first half of the book. The last parts of the book consist of ""approaches"" that will not work in small churches for reasons given in the first half of the book. One of the three main approaches requires that youth be divided into groups of 6 to 8 with similar interests and of the same sex. Another requires a cast of leaders with very specific roles and qualifications. A much better book is ""Youth Ministry in Small Churches"" by Rick Chromey. It is a very positive book written with the small church in mind, and with some ideas that are really geared toward a church with only two to a dozen or so high-schoolers."
5,"Great Humor, Great SF!","This book is one of the best SF books I ever read. I know Brown from ""Martians Go Home"" and some of his crime books - but this one is the best. I mixes humor with the idea of a parallel universe, is a bit sexy and you can really BE Keith Winton, the protagonist of the story. Read it! It's worth the money!!!"
5,Incredibly funny ...,"... and not really all that dated, given the plethora of sf adventure movies being made since Star Wars. Oh, maybe the totally gorgeous heroine who mostly stands around is a bit retro, but that's what sci fi guys expected of women when it was written, and not the only ones either. I wonder if anyone could catch the spirit of this book in a movie. I doubt it."
3,Once Fashionable,"Outdated science fiction. Some parts are original and enjoyable, others naive. Read this book in the same mind as you'd read a book by Jules Verne or H.G. Wells."
4,Good for beginners..,"I'm using this book for a lab section of GeoComputation, and after working through the first few exercises and looking through the rest of the book, I am impressed.The CD included with the book contains all of the data you'll need to complete the exercises. I found Burke's writing to be fluid and insightful. Each chapter begins with a good overview and background of what will be done. There are many diagrams, as well, so you can see the expected results.This isn't a programming book in the C++ range. It is a book detailing how to customize and make ArcView 8.x work for you using Visual Basic for Applications. Recommended. Enjoy"
4,"Great for graphics, a bit weak for tables","As a former MapInfo user, I miss everything there is about the ease of programming there. Not the author's fault of course, but the point is that ArcObjects is not that easy for novice programmers. This book makes a valiant attempt to plug the gap (see the impenetrable ESRI documentation to see how vast the gap is!) and generally succeeds. The graphics side is well covered, the explanations are sound and I'm generally happy with the book. My only criticism, from a researcher viewpoint, is that table manipulation is not covered as well as other sections. This is the section that covers creating and updating fields. It seems rushed and akwardly placed in the last chapter or so. I'd have liked more on that, but there again, this book was written for a wider audience than me. Recommended."
4,Useful Information for Getting Started with ArcObjects,This book is pretty straight forward and starts out with the basics. There are good examples to follow through with clear explanations of the process to use.
4,A very good book for starting ArcObject,My Major is GIS. But it is my first time to learn arcObject. I think it is good for my starting with its example and theories.
4,"A little too basic, but good for beginners.","When you outgrow this one, or if you already have some VB programming background, go forProgramming ArcObjects with VBA: A Task-Oriented Approach, Second Edition, it is an excellent complement to this volume. Far more to learn there."
4,Review of Getting to Know ARC OBJECTS,This book exceeded my expectations as a beginner. It is simple to follow yet stimulating enough to maintain my interest. Persons without experience and needing to do customization will find this extremely useful. Recommended for young entrants in the field of GIS who are focused on application development.
4,Getting to Know ArcObjects,"This is probably one of the best how to books for the GIS field in that it is clearly written, well illustrated and follows a logical sequence. Too many how to books start off explaining the very basics in great detail and then jump to expecting you to how to do the more complex. I am no programmer but can follow Burke and feel that not only am I able to complete the exercises but that am actually learning as I do so.This book appears aimed at people like me, have used GIS programs without ever having dived into programming. Probably too basic if you are experienced in VBA or ArcObjects but for those of us that are not this is THE place to start"
3,VBA for ArcGIS outdated at 10.1,"Great book for those interested in versions under ArcGIS 10.1 soon to debut in the next few months. I would suggest readers sort to alternative books. VBA will be no longer coming in version ArcGIS 10.1. You can use VBA at version 10 and below, however, you must get a licesnse from ESRI and if you will need to upgrade soon anyway why waste the time on VBA. HAHA."
2,Did I not read the same book as everyone else?,"I'm sorry. I'm about to tick a lot of people off, but this story was average. I read all the 5-star comments and figured, wow, this must be a great book, so I bought it. I kept reading, waiting for the parts that generated all the excitement to come, but 300 pages into the book I realized that they weren't coming. I forget the heroine's name, but she was too wimpy and obsessed about being ugly for my tastes. She was nice enough, but I didn't find anything extraordinary about her. What I did find extraordinary was the fact that so many people were fooled into believing that the blind hero could see. Talk about dumb! I don't want to insult anyone because I know every reader has his/her own likes and dislikes, but this book was pretty weenie."
5,Enchanted,"This is All I Ask. I could not have asked for a better stor.From the very first moment i began to read the book..i was trapped.Trapped in a web of enchantment,romance and anticipation.I couldn't put it down.Everytime i finished a page i just had to read another.I loved the way the heroes discovered themselves and eachother.It made me laugh and cry.I could feel the emotion eminating from each and every page.I was throughly caght up in the whole of it.I have re-read it as often as i can. A definate must! This Is All I Ask....is a book all romance lovers should read."
4,"It was good, but...","This book was good, but Julie Garwood wrote practically the same story in 1994. Julie Garwood's story was better. The name of Julie's story was ""Saving Grace"". This story was good except there was too much misunderstanding. The hero tells the heroine that he loves her only she can't figure out why he loves her and vice versa. I know they have self esteem problems but you can carry misunderstanding too far. I discovered this author on a discussion board on amazon and really like her work. Keep up the good work amazon."
3,Strong character study,"I love reading a book about flawed characters - its the perfect ones that you can't identify with. I picked this book up because I'm a sucker for Scottish romance and it said something about being set on the Scottish border. I was disappointed in that respect, but I was not disappointed with the writing. In this historical romance, the naive heroine is believably naive, the hero is strong and sensitive. I thought Ms. Kurland made great efforts to keep them believable (the hero doesn't magically get cured at the end) and from that standpoint I enjoyed the read. I found myself emotionally involved with these characters in more than place and would therefore recommend this book. A good bit of fluff to curl up on the couch with."
5,So beautiful,"In a time of English knights and castles, Christopher Blackmour was an excellent knight, but he was blinded in battle and now his world has been irrevocably changed. Lady Gillian is a young woman of average beauty who is emotionally scarred from the severe physical abuse and tyranny by her father. Through an arranged marriage, the two are united and together they begin to heal each other's wounds and rebuild their lives. Well written and emotionally gripping, this is by far one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. The characters are well developed, the plot is well thought out and the ending just makes you teary. If you never read another romance novel in your life, please try this one."
5,Excellent Book!,I love this book. I think its a wonderful and emotional novel. It is different from all the other books that I read because it shows love from a different view. I recommend this book to everyone.
1,Not Good,"This was the first book I read from Ms. Kurland and I am glad that I decided to give her another chance before totally giving up on her because she truly is a wonderful writer, but this story was just awful. I'm not sure why people liked this book so much, there was basically no plot, I don't even remember the h/h's names, I liked the secondary characters better and that's not saying a lot. I think this book was just too sappy for me (no offence to anyone who liked it). I kept reading the book hoping it would get better, it didn't. I think everyone just got sucked into feeling bad for the poor abused heroine and blind hero, I didn't. This was a forgettable novel. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Do not waste your money!,"Having read quite a number of wonderful historical fiction novels and romances, I was ""up"" for another when I began this book. Alas, I was stuck with one of the most repetitive and banal stories ever written! In fact, how did this ever get published? The characters are stock and insepid, the premise is dull and dimwitted, and the plot is non-existent, as well as redundant (which might sound like ""something,"" but trust me, the ""nothing"" that keeps getting repeated is not worth your valuable time). The main character keeps threatening to run away every five pages, and I wanted to throw the rotten book in the fire and be done with her! Do not waste your money. I wouldn't even give my copy away to an evil co-worker. Yeck."
4,Not Bad Really!,"I ordered this book online as soon as I read so many ""5 star"" comments, but I've got to say that I was expecting a lot more. I'm glad that some of the characters from Ms Kurland's earlier books were in the story (Kendrick-man of my dreams, Colin, Robin, Berengaria..). I also believe it would've been a pleasant surprise for Chris and Gillian to know Berengaria's relationship with Artane, although she was but a child back then. (But, that's neither here nor there). All-in-all, it was not bad, really!"
4,One of the sweetest stories I've ever read....,"I've read three of Lynn Kurland's books by now, and I much prefer ""This is All I Ask"" to any of her time travel stories. It is a heart-warming tale of a vulnerable woman and a man who has been to hell and back who find completion in one another. Would recommend to anyone who loves romance--medieval jargon isn't difficult at all. Not too spicy either, which is good or bad, depending on what you like! :)"
5,The most beautiful romance novel ever penned !(sigh),"This is the first Lynn Kurland novel I've ever set eyes on. I agree with every fan out there who adores this magnificent book. Gillian and Christopher are obviously meant for each other, although Gillian needs to be more convinced as she thinks that she doesn't deserve Christopher's love. The humor, the plot, and the characters are just splendidly written. The only thing that doesn't quite satisfy me is the love scenes. They lack fireworks. But overall, it deserves as many stars as U can count. =P"
3,Not a clean Kurland,This one just wasn't as clean as some of her other novels and it was sooo disappointing. Granted it's cleaner than most romance bodice rippers. I still love her! I will still read more and hey I'll let you know if they are clean or not. I did still like the story. It was a little draggy but a good story.
1,"Oh, please, stop the insanity!","I can't believe how great the reviews are on this book. I checked it out & read it & found it to be really stupid. The girl is a freaking idiot--she should be in a nunnery (where she might fit in way better than with her lusty & sexy husband). The father of the girl is such an extreme caricature that he's pretty much unbelievable. The hero is pretty good--overcoming his blindness as much as he can (sometimes to the extent that it's completely unbelievable), but his interest in Gemma seems quite forced. I've read much better."
3,So sad...,"I love Lynn Kurland's writing and have treasured every one of hers books. However, I found this one to be beyond the scope of what I could ""take"" in terms of tragedy befalling a heroine. Gillian's abuse was so gruesome and so unsettling that I found the whole book was very difficult to 'take'. Many romance novels have a theme of ""triumph & love over adversity"", but I felt this one simply went too far.While I appreciated the happy ending, it didn't make up for the deep sorrow and fear I felt in reading this book. However, I will continue to remain a Lynn Kurland fan !"
5,It's one of the best books i've ever read (& that says alot),"This is the first book from Lynn I've read, and I finished it in !ONE! night. It usually takes me a while to get through a book. I was sucked into the book on the first page whith those funny little witches, and found something to laugh about all the way through the book. The thing that really amazed me was the fact that I know people with the personalities of the characters (Jason, for instance... and i know a few fellas that are the spitting image of Christopher). This is a definate MUST read for anyone who actually LIKES to stay up all night- just you and the book."
5,unforgetable,"i would like to say first that this was the first book of her's that i had ever read, it is hard to put in to words the feeling that it brings out. it was a touching story of love, strengh and weeknesses, Kurland captured the essance of man and put it into words, all we hope for and dream about, not missing the pain and insecuritys that are in us all. i have sence read this book again and fell in love with it all over again. i say this is a must read, you will not be sorry you picked it up."
1,Useless customer no service,The heater works great but one of mine started leaking oil. The policy is to ship the defective unit to the nearest service center (Florida for me). It will cost me as much to ship the unit as it would be to buy a new one. Completely useless warranty and their customer no service department was overly unenthusiatic to help me out. I will be buying something different to replace it.
2,Confusing,"We absolutely adored this heater until it started having problems heating. It slowly has dwindled to a light warmth and we have no idea what's wrong with it. We have a feeling we have to refill it with either water or oil, but not only can't figure out how/where to do this, but we don't have a manual for it and can't find one on the internet. User friendly? Yes... until it begins it's descent into uselessness. Then it is extremely frustrating - and quite cold."
2,I wouldn't risk it.,"Mine is practically new and it began leaking oil, INSIDE THE HOUSE! Luckily it was in the kitchen and none got on the carpet, but i don't recommend anyone give this heater the opportunity to do such damage. Before the leaking began, it worked great."
3,"""EVEN SANTA IS POOR THIS YEAR...""","This book can be read in two or three sittings, but I do not consider it a true Christmas read, as the title implies. Three quarters of the book occur in the summer and fall, though it does end with a glorious, homemade Christmas tree. Young teen Francy discovers what Christmas really means-even if you are poor. We admire Francy who is coping with shame about the family poverty, resentment at a snobby cousin, fear over her mother's illness, agony at being cheated by outsiders, and even cow ownership.But she is strong and clever as well, and pulls the hardest in times of family crisis. The Ponders prove resiliant against all odds--even an inspiration to the county when it comes to celebrating Christmas. There is a heart-warming and satisfying seasonal end as she comes of age in her heart. One wonders if the author is reliving her own childhood or that of a close relative. If you like the Waltons, you'll feel at home with the Ponders."
2,Disappointing,"After reading and enjoying Wandering Stars in its original published version many years ago, I was really looking forward to reading this sequel. However, I found that it did not live up to the promise of its predecessor.Most of the stories were fantasy, rather than science fiction, and I'm not particularly fond of that genre. It was a definite letdown."
2,The CD is soooo much better,"I Love Greg Behrendt! But this show is sub-par. It is an old set, pre-book, it sounds like he is reading the jokes. His delivery on the original CD is far better. I wish I could find some of his older stuff, I caught a show of his on Comedy Central a long time ago and it was the best stand up I have seen in a while. It contained the toasted sandwiches and pumkin seeds bits.Greg gets 5 stars, but this DVD is only gets 2."
1,X-rated,"I was a fan of Greg Behrendt TV show and was disappointed when it was removed from the air. I bought this DVD based on my experience from the show, but was disappointed with his comedy. It is sorta vulgar comedy with Greg saying the F... word many times in his dialog. I just don't appreciate this type of comedy and don't find it very funny. Sorry, Greg. I hope he gets a show back on television."
4,Kim's review,"This stand up made me laugh alot, and I could really relate to him. You are never to old to rock."
4,This guy is hilarious!,"I had tears streaming down my face while watching this. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is due to the language. I don't mind swearing, but he's a little over-the-top. Don't let your small children watch, but my teenagers watched with me and loved it. His ""adult rock show"" idea is brilliant and extremely amusing."
2,Didn't live up to promise,"I bought 6 of these bulbs, to replace some incandescent bulbs as they burned out. One of the TCP bulbs was dead upon arrival. 2 more have since burned out. Meanwhile one incandescent bulb has outlasted them. On the positive side they aren't too dim when first turned on as some CFL's can be, but it still takes a little while to reach full brightness."
2,"""Quadrilogy"" is not a word.","The word is ""tetralogy."" A series of 4. ""Quadrilogy"" is not a word.Go to school. Read a book. Avoid these movies."
1,I can't play it on my DVD,I bought this item and was super excited to play it on my big screen when I realized that it doesn't play on my dvd/blue ray. It's a diverse dvd player but this dvd set is British standards that doesn't work in the US. My brother was to play it in his computer by changing some settings. This is very limiting. I'm very dissappointed.
2,Xmen Quadrilogy,The package was missing the Wolverine bluray disc. It was supposed to be in a slim case. The shipment came quickly.
4,X-Men here we come!,"X-Men, great series, what's there not to like about Logan and all the other mutants. Wolverine Origins is by far the best one!"
2,the DVDs that we received were formatted for Irish systems,The DVDs were formatted for Irish DVD Players and could not be adjusted. We did not realise we were ordering the DVDs from another country and they were worthless to us! We would have assumed that a company shipping to an American address would send a product that would work on American DVD Players.
2,"Wrong Region, won't play in any of our DVD players","Purchased 2 sets for Christmas gifts, neither will play on our DVD players giving the wrong region error code. I had no idea this issue existed, live and learn, I know now. I have since looked at other sellers on Amazon regarding Region 2 products and some have made an extra effort to explain Region 2 purchases and what areas of the world goes with which Region version. This information is very helpful and extremely important. I wish my seller would have bothered to explain this important piece of information it would have saved me time and money."
4,jdseiler,This is an excellent look at the more personal side of the band and how they can surprise you in some situations. They make you wish you were with them!
4,nice,"i looked at a variety of bread knives and this was my favorite. although pricey, i did like the design. most of the knives i looked were super light, which i didn't like. i like some weight. though not as heavy as i would like, it felt good. the knife is extremely sharp. when i took it out of the box, i just brushed the blade against my finger and gashed it. it was barely a touch. it cuts through bread very nicely. you can get super thin slices of french bread/bagettes. no more wrestling and crushing bread. the blade is designed to get minimal crumbs. like anything you invest in, check out a variety of different products before picking one. if you can afford it, it's well worth it. beautiful blade too."
5,Great for more than bread.,"I have had several bread knives over the years, all good quality, but this is by far my favorite. The steel is exceptionally hard and takes an edge like no other. Great handle, very elegant and ergonomic.I use this for carving turkey and roasts, large tasks like cabbage and lettuce shredding, it has proven to be very useful well beyond bread duties.Can't reccomend the Shun knives highly enough, and the Elite line is the best of the best for me. Kershaw customer service for warranty issues is also second to none."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!,SUPER FAST shipping! They were a tiny bit of a chore for my husband to put together but in 30 mins or so I had BEAUTIFUL endtables! these are a wee bit of an espresso color but the rest of my furniture is black and isnt at all noticable! Its so dark of a color some could mistake it for black. Either way though BEST purchase I have made online! HANDS DOWN!
2,THIS IS NOT BLACK.,"It's hard to know how to review this since all that I did was open the box, note the color and then ship it back. I'm sure that it would have been an awesome little table, but I needed a black one, and as several other reviewers have noted (I actually found this table elsewhere on Amazon and didn't see those reviews), this ISN'T black and isn't even close to black. It's a dark cherry (reddish hue) and I don't know how in the world that the company could describe it as black."
2,Wrong color,I was very disappointed to learn that the table was not black. It's a dark espresso color. This product was advertised as black. Now I have to return this product!
1,Beware,The table was all scratched on top and had some kind of white stuff on it. Very dissappointedI was looking forward to having these tables in livingroom. Do not buy this.
2,You get what you pay for,Very poorly built. The screw holes strip out easily or don't hold the screw at all and the bolt that holds the knob on is not long enough to reach the knob. It's a nice looking table but it has the made in China quality.
5,Great Value,"This is a great value. I was pleasantly surprised when I got my two tables. They looked like they would have been more expensive. They are just the right size also, not too big or too small. I have one on either side of my sofa. I am very happy with them. They were not hard to assemble."
3,Surprisingly...,"this end table is prettier than I expected and bigger too! I was blown away but as feared, my end table was sent in dark brown not black as read in some reviews. Also, it had a tiny crack in the middle area. I was upset at first but I wasn't going to waste my time arguing with these people, sending it back and having it purchased all over again so I decided to keep it as is."
4,Round black side table,"The drawers stick a little bit and some of the pre-drilled holes did not match up to make for easy assembly. Other than that, the tables look elegant once assembled and are the perfect size for nightstands."
5,Elegant and Stylish,"This table was very easy to put together. Very Sturdy, Elegant and Beutiful. My Humidor fits perfectly on top and looks amazing as a showpiece. The drawer is perfect for holding all the cigar accessories. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quality table."
5,very nice,"Nice quality, looks great and easy to assemble. Shipped fast and packaged well. I would order Winsome products again in the future."
1,You get what you pay for.,"There is a reason this is so cheap - because it is cheap. Plastic type ""wood"". Screw threads were installed in reverse in a couple locations making it completely impossible to assemble. Returned."
1,"Poor quality--not going for ""third time's a charm""","Would not recommend that you buy this product. The first time I got it, it was scratched badly on the edge. It also looked like it was chipped underneath, and the manufacturer glued it back together & painted over it. I was surprised they actually shipped it out and didn't write it off as defective. The replacement could not be assembled. The pre-drilled holes made the legs not equally spaced, so the little shelf could not be attached with the holes that were there. Save your $$ and find something better.On a positive note, Amazon made the returns effortless--so at least there was good customer service."
4,Very nice,These tables are very nice and look great but I never got to use them. I sold them bc they are not a good to use in a lving room setting with small children because they topple easy especially on carpet. They are nice for bedstands but still would not recommend them on plush carpets.
1,False Communication,"Ordered 2 tables, online said available, got a call a few days later, items on backorder for about 1 month. 2 days later received an e-mail items had shipped. Called company and items had not shipped and were still on backorder. Order cancelled and refund received. Had I not called and just accepted the e-mail that they were shipped I would be waiting and waiting. Very poor and false communication."
2,You get what you pay for.,cheaply made and looks like painted oak. Maybe they had some left over from the seventies and decided to paint them to sell.
3,Awesome if you don't have kids or large pets,"These are lovely and easy to put together. HOWEVER, we are rating them only 3 as if you have large pets, or young children THEY WILL NOT hold up and are not as sturdy as you will want. Ours shake a lot due to their overall design and wobble even being in the ""parent's"" master bedroom. If you bump it or a child hits it, it just is not as sturdy as I would like. I don't know if its the top being wider than the base, the way they are screwed together or the overall design. My husband has re-read the instructions a few times and has them completely put together as pictured. AGain, they are beautiful and good composite but not as sturdy as we wish we had."
1,Damaged table top,Item received was damaged and it was missing hardware. This item was a gift for xmas and now I have to delay presenting item until company provides a repaired table top.
5,great product,received product on time..product recvd as described.I was able to assemble the tables easily and quickly...great great product...love my 2 tables!!
5,Great little bedside table!,Nice looking table. Easy to put together. I had no assembly problems like some others. Great price and fast shipping.
2,This table is NOT BLACK!,"I didn't even keep it long enough to put it together due to it not being black as described. It is a dark cherry color stain. It did seem to be a fairly nice table, however, for the price. I just needed it in black. Also it is larger than I had expected."
5,Great Looking Table at a Great Price,"Like another reviewer mentioned, the shelf wasn't pre-drilled on our table either but that was an easy fix. It is a beautiful table, especially for the money. If I saw this in a store I would have expected to pay $150=$250 for it. Don't hesitate, it's a great buy."
3,wooden table,This is a handsome piece of furniture and looks nice in any room. The second shelf and drawer are a plus. Fairly sturdy but is able to hold heavier weighted objects.
4,Winsome Round End Table,"We were searching for an end table to match my new black leather chair for the rec room. Bought this one and was pleasantly surprised. Inexpensive and nice looking. The only negative would be that it's taller than I thought it would be, which makes it a tiny bit wobbly on a carpeted surface. As long as I keep the grandkids away from it................"
5,Great Buy,"Real wood not particle board. Mostly pre-put together out of the box. In fact I've never had a pre-fabbed piece of furniture this good and of this quality. Obviously the Chinese didn't get the memo that at this price point Americans are supposed to get cheap, flimsy, thin particle board furniture. I think we should enjoy it while it lasts."
4,READ THIS REVIEW!,"Ok, first of all, these tables give you a good bang for your buck.they are made of solid wood however, quality is lacking.after reading the reviews I was hoping that I would get the dark brown color unfortunately I got black which is exactly as advertised.I bought 2 tables although one table is far better than the other.no real complaints about the good table however the bad table has some workmanship issues. it came scratched and the top had been machined improperly.assembly was a breeze.... 1 piece of advice would be to install all the screws loosly and in the end Tighten all the bolts together."
2,small!,"these tables look very nice. I ordered 2, and one came with a huge gash in it, and I just didnt feel like sending it back after assembling them both. The thing is they are SO SMALL! I have a table lamp, picture frame (4x6) and a small candle on one, and there is no room for anything else on the table. If I want to put a glass of water on the table I have to move everything around just to do so. If it wasn't so much work to send them back, I would."
5,Elegant little table,This table was a cinch to put together and is quite sturdy! The wood is an espresso color and the transitional style can go modern or traditional. I'm thinking of getting another for my guestroom.
5,excellent table!,"super easy and fast to assemble. the instructions are very simple. The table is a lot more firm and stable than what can be appreciated in the picture. The drawer is very small, but it gives it a nice little detail, a couple of pens and some post-its or a set of cards fit good in it, not much more. Overall, it's a great buy, specially being solid wood, even the drawer is all wood, looks like oak. The glossy finish gives it a nice crisp black look, but not too ""bling-bling""."
4,Very nice round table,"The table was as advertised. The construction and finish is very good. The design is excellent. The price was excellent. It was a bit trickey to assemble, but I got it done. A round table like this is very hard to find in the furniture stores. We are very happy with the two that we bought."
2,difficult installation,"The quality is good. However, it was quite difficult to install the legs. There were no holes ready for the screws, I was not strong enough to put the screws in wood. Plus, it was very difficult to put the legs at the righ positions. I put them on and off three times... Now they seem Okay. If you are good at carpenter work, this should not be a problem."
5,A++++++,This table was super easy to assemble and looks great. I was originally skeptical due to the price being so good....but this table is a great deal!!!!
2,not happy,"We ordered these bar stools thinking they would be adequate for our kitchen highland since there were so many positive reviews on line for the product: they are terrible! We are so disappointed, it took forever to put the 3 stools together to find out the 2 positions don't do the job (the short position make them look like they are for midgets, and the high is way too high...) They do not look good in our kitchen, actually we are thinking of selling them and spending more money to get others."
3,"Interesting, but I was a little disappointed....","I really wanted to like this book, and it was interesting because of the subject matter, but I felt it got bogged down in the respect that the author was constantly running around from one ""controlled experiment"" to another to prove his abilities to everyone. Yes, he probably does have these amazing psychic and healing abilities, but he should stop trying so hard to prove it with one ""test"" after another.........enough already! Another thing that bothered me was his obvious jealousy toward Uri Geller, another PSI gifted fellow, who was very popular during that time. This shouldn't be about who is better or more amazing at their gift.......the gift alone is enough. The writing style was also a little stiff. He needed to loosen up a little and enjoy life and his gift a little more. Don't be so uptight and competitive! Would anyone like to buy my copy?"
1,Not Sexy,"With the exception of a few images (including the one on the cover) this book is much more focused on the couture than the kinky. The latex-clad models look bored rather than aroused, and the artist's interest in clown suits is one I do not share.I was also surprised to see photographs of men in this collection, since both the reviews and the product description indicated that the models were female. Furthermore, the men she chose were not attractive, and instead of being nude or erotically dressed, they just had on some wild latex gimp suit. Just not my thing."
3,Straight-forward Kink,"This was a fun book, but I was a little disappointed with it. While there were indeed many wonderful full colour photos of lovely ladies in lace and leather, the poses were all very generic, mostly straight on with little to no scenery adaptation or activity. Very few of the pictures did anything to excite me beyond the exotic garb. A good buy if you really like kinky-outfits, not so good if you're looking for entertainment."
5,"Smokin' hot guitar, silky smooth vocals","I've had the pleasure of seeing Brian Nova perform live, what a showman! His guitar playing is incredible, and he has a vocal style that is reminisent of Frank Sinatra. After listening to my copy of Blue and Bossa Nova I must say that I was not dissapointed. The lightning fast guitar licks are tastefully dispersed throughout fine melodic improvisation, and the remainder of the quartet,( Buddy Catlett, Larry fuller, Greg Williamson), are rock solid, locking into groove after groove. I like to put this on, put my feet up and enjoy a glass of Merlot after a hard days work. This is a c.d. to be 'savored'."
5,BUY THIS!,"I have a copy of this already, I bought another for someone else. It really is one of the best English translations around. Very easy to read and understand as it uses modern English unlike other translations. It has introductory section going through each surah and the why and how it was revealed. The writing in Arabic is very clear. Its a nice big hard copy and looks very beautiful. It was recommended to me by a Quran teacher who has an extensive collection of different translations of the Quran from around the world and he named this one as the best one, when you read it and I think you will also agree. Also, a nice gift. I bought it for a friend and he was really chuffed. Shame you cant get it the UK though I had to get it shipped from the US, but it was worth it!"
4,great shorts!,"Very happy with these shorts, but much longer than I expected. Seamstress fixed them and now they're my favorite pair!"
4,Great Camo shorts,"Very good pair of camo shorts, had been looking for a decent pair. Only 2 negatives:front pockets are shallow, could loose keys, change; center drawstring is too short.Nice thick cotton material, realistic camo color and pattern, plenty of pockets."
3,Great service from seller!,"Received the shorts and they were far too large. Contacted the seller and he was very helpful and accommodating with the return. Although this purchase didn't work out, we would definitely purchase from this seller again. Thanks Jason."
2,Not satisfied with sizing chart,"The sizing chart listed was not accurate. Hence, the shorts ordered were about 5 sizes too big."
2,Below average in every aspect of film making.,"This movie was recommended by a friend whose opinions I no longer trust. :) I felt this movie could have been better if there was a larger budget and someone to punch-up the script. The story was okay, but the script just couldn't bring me into the story. In the long run it came across as a bad ""Tales from the Crypt"" episode. I found myself frequently checking how much time remained on the movie and was not in the least scared, on edge, or spooked. It was a fairly boring movie."
3,You've seen this movie before,"This was an okay movie. Unfortunately it didn't bring anything new or original to the table. It was a little scary, but all in all, I just wasn't impressed. I wish that I'd watched something else."
1,Scarey movie? Pull the other one!,"How can one be scared by this silly movie? The first half wasn't bad, actually had some good moments, but after that, either the film makers ran out of money, time, or ideas. The ending is silly and predictable You'd have to be under five years old to be scared by this. What scared me the most was realizing that I had wassted time watching this nonsense!"
4,Mind Blowingly Scary!,"I love to be scared and this movie REALLY delivered the goods!The concept of a child using astral projection and then getting lost, unable to find his way back to his body was a great concept! His body is unprotected and spirits want to possess it so they can live again, but there is a demon that wants it even more so he can enter our world and spread pain and suffering! However when we actually saw the demon it looked like Darth Maul's retarded cousin.The ghosts were creepy as hell and the ghost world was portrayed beautifully and it creeped the hell outta me and had me constantly on my toes! The old lady ghost was creepy too, she gave me nightmares for days!If you love scary movies or if you liked the Paranormal Activity movies, then you'll love this one!"
5,Scared the crap outta me! Loved it!,"This is one of the few movies that seriously scared me. I saw it in theaters and now I am going to buy it on blu-ray so I can keep it for myself and be thrilled all over again. If you're looking for a good scare, you won't be disappointed in this movie!"
2,Insipid,"Have you seen Poltergeist? The Changeling? Jeepers Creepers? Paranormal Activity? Darkness Falls? Dead Silence? Then you've already seen the best bits that this movie pays ""homage"" to. In other words, nothing new here. I love James Wan. He always comes up with something different. The only thing different here is the concept of astral projection which hasn't been explored so much in movies before. Other than that, the first part of this film was kind of creepy. The second part had me saying ""Really? James? This is how you're ending this?"" Makes me wonder if there is a sequel coming. Makes me kind of hope there isn't."
2,I can't believe it!!!,"I can't believe that it actually says that it is the most horrifying film since the exorcist...please...this movie couldn't hold a candle nowhere near the exorcist...the exorcist is the best creepiest horror movie ever made and i doubt anyone will ever be able to make a better horror movie than the exorcist...this movie is worth a viewing or two because it does have it's moments but it's such a disgrace from whoever put that it was the most horrifying film since the best horror movie of all time and if you think this, i know everyone has a right to their own opinion, but watch the exorcist first then watch this right after and see which one is more horrifying to you!!!"
2,Really??? Scary? I don't think so...,"I rented this on a lark hopping for some good horror...and was highly disappointed. If you enjoyed Paranormal Activity you'll love it. A bit higher budget with lame special effects, bad acting and an even worse story line. If I had paid movie theater prices for this I would have been pissed. As it was only $3.99, I can just say, ""meh"" and walk away."
1,The only thing scary is how bad it is.,"I read a description of this movie somewhere that implied the young boy was the one haunting the property. That was not true. Instead, the boy leaves his body and gets lost in The Futher. That is cool, until we find out that he is being held hostage by Darth Maul who has a fetish for the song 'Tip Toe Through The Tulips' by that weird 1960s singer Tiny Tim. Leaving us as an audience thinking, nevermind..."
5,Great movie!,"Loved this movie, and it has stuck with me as one of the best scary movies I have ever seen. I have told a lot of people about it."
1,ZERO STARS.,"This movie was horrible, tasteless, generic, and just all-around bad, but to be fair, I've never even been able to finish it (due to falling asleep somewhere in the middle or turning it off in disgust). Perhaps the ending makes up for it all; although, I highly doubt it. It seems like the movie tried way too hard and uses every cliche horror movie scare tactic in the book. I'm sorry, but I see no hope for this movie, and if you're a true horror fan I wouldn't recommend this piece of garbage. If this scares you, you might as well not even touch any real horror movies. Stick to the new version of ""horror""."
3,Let Me Tell You What Scary Really Is...,"""The Others."" Now, that is classic, makes-you-shudder, can't-get-it-out-of-your-head SCARY. ""Insidious"" reached for the stars and didn't even make it to the tree tops. As everyone seems to agree, the first part of the movie was promising. The second part, however, was swamped with cheap thrills, cartoon make-up and amateur special effects. I was disappointed and amused. With an actor like Barbara Hershey on board, I was expecting much, much more. I have to give it three stars, however, because I loved the two bumbling ghost hunters."
1,Holy pixelation!!,I received a very inferior DVD. 3/4 of the movie is nothing but stops and starts with the pixels running wild. It plays like a pirated copy. I could not view enough of the movie to even rate it.
1,darth mahl meets craig kilbourne,"boring, predictable, unoriginal. this movie is a watered down poltergeist that has a few good ideas but over all a boring movie with nothing new to offer to the horror section of life"
1,This is not Paranormal Acitivity,"You will jump a couple of times. The ideas introduced in the movie are great.The acting is a little strange and it seems like the writing staff was fired in the middle of writing this movie.This movie is a mixture of The Cell, Paranormal Activity and a bad homemade Halloween movie."
1,Terrible Movie,If you want a movie that is a waste of your time..watch this one. There are two or three scare parts and the rest of the movie is horrible. Dont wast your money on this movie.
3,Um ok..,"Was this movie bad? No. Was this movie the ""scariest"" movie I've seen in a long time? No. It was ok. I bought it from Walmart for 5 bucks. I did almost laugh when I saw the spirit/demon/ monster thing. He kinda reminds me of The Mighty Boosh lol. If you're a person who is easily impressed by cheap jumps and loud noises, then you will probably think this is the best movie ever! But if you're a real horror movie fan, you won't be that impressed. Could've been worse...."
2,"Oh, Puhleeeze! Steampunk Demons?","Lame. Lame. Lame. This was a good concept poorly executed. The paranormal team equipment was laughable as were they. It was believable up to the seance, then jumped the shark. The journey into wraith land was pretty good until Steampunk hell. Then the whole ending was just lame. I expected a better ending for sure... not happy, but better written. I'm sorry I spent almost $10.00 on this stupid movie."
5,An OK horror movie...,I thought this movie was a good horror movie and had some exciting parts worth watching if you are into the horror genre. It is always disturbing to me to see children possessed or having a bad time in life.
4,Insidious,It has been a long time since a horror movie actually creeped me out. I am glad they focused on making the movie scary instead of just being gory. It has some funny parts as well.
4,I thought this movie. .,"pretty good. I was prepared to be scared watching it alone, and I was a bit scared, but I think that really surprised me is that it has a good story line for a horror movie!!! Not that this wasn't reminiscent of other horror movies (Poltergeist, The Messengers. .) but I was pleased with this movie."
4,Gets under your skin!,"Like Paranormal Activity, this story really got under my skin and gave me some chills at night because of the dynamic of people being attacked in their home, despite a security system. Even children are at risk--actually, more at risk than their parents are--of being taken and possessed by demonic entities. The idea of not even being safe in your own bed is what bothers me more than the usual bogeyman stories.The actors are convincingly frightened or frightening here, and the effects are pretty decent as well."
4,INSIDIOUS: THE SCARIEST FILM OF THE YEAR,"From the writer and director of Saw, and the creators of Paranormal Activity comes Insidious, the scariest film since... well... Paranormal Activity. The film is about a happy family that moves into a house that they suspect later to be haunted. When the son falls into what they think is a coma, they move out of the house into a new one only to find out that it wasn't the house that was haunted.I won't spoil the rest of it, but it is a very smartly done horror film that relies on traditional values of classic horror instead of false scares like things running off the screen to fast to see. It has in my opinion the creepiest score since the original Psycho, and some of the most down right disturbing images to grace my mind in a long time. All in all, it's a spooky good time, and the best horror film so far this year."
1,Waste of money!,"What a waste of money. Actually went to the theater to see this.... the audience spent more time laughing than jumping. Horrible, horrible, horrible.... cheesy ""scary dude with the red face"".... what a sad waste of time and money."
1,Not worth the dollar I paid for the rental,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie. Reviews seemed to suggest a good horror movie. The first half of the movie seemed as if it was heading in that direction. Had a creepy feel to it, similar to Paranormal activity. Then the pace of the movie changed completely. It was if they switched directors mid movie, the change was that dramatic. It went from creepy horror with promise to corny cheesey, b-movie wanna be. I won't post an spoilers incase people still decide they want to continue with watching, but be warned. The scariest thing about this movie is how scary bad it got towards the end!"
1,I should have been paid to watch this,The only explanation I can come up with for the positive reviews is a lot of people with very short attention spans and no ability to realize they've been duped. The director used A SMOKE MACHINE. So much wrong with this... I can't waste another moment to mull it over.
2,"If they'd just stopped about halfway, this would've been decent","Worth a rental, no way you're paying moviegoer fare for this.Starts off well enough, using the ole' less is more formula of haunted houses, but that's the essence of fright - letting the audience scare itself by leaving out concrete details such as the true appearance of ghosts/demons. Paranormal Activity used the less is more formula to great effect. Amazing how scared you can get on a budget flick.Anyway, Insid builds it up but lets it down in the end, where the film just implodes, turns on itself and removes any sense of fright created so clearly in the start and middle.The most frightening film since The Exorcist? Demon, please.The most terrifying film since Poltergeist? Shame on you, promoter-voice guy.A two-star one-night rental to enjoy and forget? Right on, daddy-o."
1,Are you kidding me... scary?!,"I made the mistake and let the trailers and ""scariest movie in years"" tagline fool me.I loved Paranormal Activity 1 and 2, so I thought this one should be a decent horror flick.The demon/devil creature looked like a combination between Nacho Libre's wrestling partner and Darth Maul from Star Wars, that's suppose to be scary? The story was slow paced and the main character felt lacking.I love horror flicks and live for them, Insidious had me fall asleep 3 times during the movie and this was when the ""scary"" parts were about to happen.I tossed the Bluray to a friend, told him to keep it and to never give it back. I won't rush buy again."
5,great movie scary and interesting,"This kept you going and into the movie this is worth the price. the acting was good, and it had a good plot"
4,Good.,"In my opinion this was a very good scary movie. I'm someone who can watch scary movies and not be phased, but this movie creeped me out at times. Good movie to watch once, but not something that I would watch again."
2,2 Different Movies,My wife and I really enjoyed the first half of the film. It had some gotchya moments and genuine scares. The second half of the film (pretty much when the ghost hunters arrived and thereafter)went quickly downhill in my opinion. The movie actually became quite silly and slipped into absurdity. And that ending...ugh.
4,Don't Look Now...,"Don't stare into those eyes for too long. You'll see them in your dreams if you do...not the little boy's but rather the black and red-faced creature's.Good flick. Nice violin and smash-hands-on-a-piano music. I personally was pretty cool throughout the whole movie, though I think everyone has a certain variety that specifically ""does it"" for them. I found ""The Rite"" to be more mine.It's interesting to read the comments here on amazon and the opinions / beliefs on what they call astral projection. It's one of those things that you really cannot disagree with someone on, and nobody can tell whether someone else did or didn't experience what they say they did. But, rest assured now that it's ""out in the open,"" those who claim they have had such experiences will begin to reference to this movie to try to make their case stronger...as if that will help instead of bringing giggles."
4,"Jump inducing, butt puckering, scarefest with minimal hokiness","Insidious is defined as operating or proceeding in an inconspicuous or seemingly harmless way, but actually with grave effect. This movie relies on the slow burn....cranking up your nerves with small jumps and tense music. It builds and builds, until it finally dumps a bucket of crazy on you. If you love good supernatural horror movies, then you know good ones don't come along very often. This movie caught me a little off guard. It's a jump inducing, butt puckering, scarefest with minimal hokiness. One of my favorites since Drag Me to Hell..."
2,Horrible,"When I gear up to watch a horror movie, I expect a whole hell of a lot. My standards for horror are VERY high. This movie misses the mark by about 700 miles. There are a few creepy moments scattered throughout, and places where you see the potential for a truly terrifying movie, but it pulls back from every good idea it has. The concept is great, the movie is NOT. It gets super cheesy toward the end, like, unforgivably cheesy. Look, some men's trash is others treasure. I was wildly unimpressed with this movie. I hoped for a lot more."
1,avoid with a capital A,"The only thing insidious about this film is the nearly constant screaming and bawling of the infant in the film. It's bad enough to have to put up with bad behavior from moviegoers without having to suffer through the same annoyances on the screen. A lot of reviews trumpet the first half of the film... I guess compared to the second half, folks are trying to be generous in looking for something to put a positive spin on. Not even worth straight-to-bargain-bin prices."
2,Sad Movie,"Because there are people out there who might believe this could really happen. Out of body traveling. This is a cross betweeh Potergeist, Amityville Horror and a little of The Exorcist. It kept me on the edge of my seat hoping something really scary was going to happen. Forget that. A couple scenes were good. The demon with the red face and the fork tongue was interesting. The people with the stupid grins were good as well but that was all I liked about this movie. The whole concept of a person traveling out of his or hers body. without being dead is fiction. I bought the Blu-Ray hoping it would really make the movie good. No chance. I want my $19.99 back. If paranormal mumbo jumbo stupidity is your thing then this movie is de-finitely for you other wise pass on it."
4,Creepy Yes Scary Ehh,"Insidious is a movie that I would classify as being creepy and less scary. It starts off with a family moving into a new house with their 2 little boys and baby daughter. Soon strange things start to occur, like books being knocked off the shelf and boxes being moved to the attic. To make a long story short and without giving anything of importance away, one of the boys is being haunted a little more than the others. I do believe that Isidious and Poltergeist share a lot of similar elements. All in all I did feel slightly uneasy while watching it and had the urge to look over my shoulder, but I didn't jump or feel actually scared. While the ending is somewhat predictable, I just accepted that I knew what was gonna happen just let myself enjoy it. I definitely recommend watching it if you love scary movies."
5,excellent,I dont leave a lot of reviews but I liked this movie a lot. I love horror movies and agree with many of the other reviews. This movie is excellent. Paranormal Activity meets The Excorcist meets Poltergeist. Wish it would have had a digital copy :( but still 5 stars.
4,Up There With The Exorcist and The Shining,"There are a few movies that just scare me to the point of not watching them again, or at least not watching them alone. The first two were the Exorcist and The Shining; now many years later another movie has finally reached that standard again. This is a terrifying, spooky movie that left me unsettled. Very good atmospheric horror movie that is for the most part top-notch in every respect. Some will be put off by the 'final act' at the end of the movie but it is still very much worth watching if you want a good scare or if you feel many horror movies aren't up to the task of scaring you. Not without flaws, but in my opinion, this movie could reach 'classic' status among horror films."
2,Not so hot,"Low budget Poltergeist rip off. I expected more somehow. Acting is fairly good, effects are cheezy. I'd give it a pass."
3,Undescribable,"Well my friend and I were waiting for the great haunting moments that we heard about to pop up but the movie has now ended. Well! It depends on what frightens and entertains you. ""Different strokes for different folks."""
2,Was hoping for a lot more,"As a lot of reviewers have mentioned. The first half was a lot better than the second half. Something that really turned me off from this movie was that they copied a lot of the plot from Paranormal Activity 2. It was almost the same thing. I think in Paranormal Activity 2 they even had something that had to do with pictures.Also what paranormal activity does very well is that it doesn't show the ""demon"" and when Insidious does show it, its flat out laughable. Its like a man with a Halloween costume and some face paint. Total fail. The movie could have been better with just better directing and set design as well."
2,"Insidious is half good, half terrible. I recommend watching the first half",Insidious starts off great. It begins with great camera work and a real eerie style. It's actually really good. That is until the second half of the movie occurs and we start figuring things out. It then becomes less scary and more laughable. It changes from a horror movie to a sci-fi/fantasy movie that is completely inappropriate. If you really want to get a full review of this movie go to: [...]
2,Starts great and the falls very far behind,"The way insidious started, it had the potential to become one of the scariest movies of all time. The first hour or so were confusing, with great setup and even better execution. The type of great scary movie where you know something scary is going to happen and are still scared out of your mind when it does! This was great. But then the movie went quickly downhill. The last part was some stupid, goofy bad movie which you wouldn't want to have anything to do with.How did this movie go so far off track? Did the director go home or the writer's get fired? It just went so bad so quickly. What a shame because it had such promise. Save your money and don't rent or buy this turkey."
2,Snoozefest - what scares?,"I didn't find this movie even slightly scary, or entertaining. A poor rehash of the much better done Poltergeist. I spent the movie being bored or rolling my eyes. Finally had to shut it off with 30 minutes to go."
1,Lamefest,"Starts off OK and then slips into bizzaro world. This movie has ""should a, would a, could a"" written all over it. Cheeseball demon is included with some ghosts that are not scary once they are revealed. The director shows too much and leaves nothing to the imagination. Disappointed with 75% of the film and it is so disappointing I can't recommend the decent beginning at all."
2,I wanted to like this!!,"But in the end it just ended up being another dull, non-scary ghost type story. For me, it just didn't live up to the hype. I love movies that make me jump but this just didn't deliver :("
2,save your money,"save your money,watch poltergeist instead. insidious is an updated poltergeist clone. only reason for 2 star review is interesting dvd cover art."
3,'Poltergeist' meets 'Paranormal Activity.',"Not as good as Poltergeist was in its day - but I never really thought that much of Paranormal Activity; so it is definitely better than the latter.Tried hard, should have tried harder."
2,-Insipidious-,"Decent production values and the sometimes startling visuals and soundtrack might make this movie an effective entry for an adolescent's Halloween film festival.For others, the story involves far too many actors wandering around in some kind of juvenile derivative gobbledygook about ""astral projection""."
2,Insidious didn't do it for me,"I wanted to like it, being a fan of Saw, but no go. This was bad Hollywood horror filmmaking. Just endless scenes, took itself too seriously. and not enough scares by a long shot."
4,gift,"purchased as a requested gift, movie was as described, brand new, scary movie class, recipient had already seen it and wanted it."
2,Insidious is NOT insidious,"I found this movie to be a very poor ""Poltergeist"" rip-off. It is NOT scary in the least, and isn't even a little creepy in the story line. Real waste of time."
2,Waiting for the scary part....,"I watched after reading the reviews that indicated that this was a truly scary movie. I guess I must have missed something because this film was not scary. Creepy at times, sure. Decent story line, maybe. But I can't go much further than that. Was it a bad movie, not really. But scary, no. If this movie had gone more the Hitchcock route it might have stood a chance since it had that older film flare."
5,Good!! Great!! Fantastic!!! Awesome!!,"I really liked this movie and i especially likedthat song that they played when the little boywas dancing...I think it was called and I quote""Tiptoe Through The Tulips"" It was a very wierdsong but it suited the movie very well"
3,Spooky,Insidious builds to some decent chills and a couple of scares and is a very good haunting movie.The second half has a strong Poltergeist feel to it and closer resembles Polergeist than Paranormal activity but a little scarier and a little less corny.To be watched late at night with the lights off.I insidious 3.5 out of 5
3,Delivers the Chills,"This is scary. What's that materializing out of the gloom?I did find the explanation for the manifestations to be rather silly and reaching - at first. But then as I thought about it, it seemed perhaps this movie provided as good an explanation as any for the existence of serial killers and for evil in general.If you want a similar, but lower-key, more philosophical rationale for the existence of slow, dampening evil, I suggest you read J. B. Priestley's classic short story ""The Grey Ones."""
4,Much better than average ghost story,"""Insidious"" raises the bar on the good old fashion ghost story. To begin with we have an excellent cast headed by Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, the parents of 2 young sons. Josh (Wilson) is a teacher and Renai (Byrne) a struggling songwriter and full time homemaker. They move into a new house which, as expected, is apparently haunted. Here we get some very creepy scenes of haunting ghosts and demons. The twist is that they move again and viola, the ghosting is back! I'm no fan of torture-porn films so have so far resisted the ""Saw"" franchise, but their filmmakers are responsible for this goreless horror film. Technically, it is very effective. The ending is a bit much and tends to coral the film into a traditional finish. Still, I liked it very much."
4,Enjoyable but not a classic,"Sorry, but this is just a ""Poltergeist"" knock off. I jumped a few times due to shock scares but it wasn't very scary. ""Insidious"" is very much like James Wan's ""Dead Silence"" in looks and structure (even the scares). About half way through ""Insidious"" the story changed and I thought ""now it's all going south,"" but it held together just enough to keep my attention. Others have compared ""Insidious"" to ""The Exorcist"" and I have to say that is ridiculous; on a scale from 1 to 10, ""The Exorcist"" is an 11 and ""Insidious"" is maybe a 2.Still, I enjoyed ""Insidious"", liked the ending, and will watch it again.If you like this, try ""Dead Silence."""
4,Insidious,"This James Wan masterpiece in horror is a standout. It is significant in that it gives an old-horror feel without compromising surrealism (e.g. the puppet-looking family members forever reenacting how they died, which is a nod to the Saw puppet also created by Wan). The obtrusive musical score is the only thing I do not like."
4,A different kind of horror,If you want a movie that is actually creepy then watch this movie. I am hard to scare or creep out but this movie did it for me.
3,Disciple,The electronic version is dose no mirror the printed version. Questions in the printed version are not in the electronic version and the note page the print is much to small.
4,Disciple Book,This book had more marks than I thought it should.It was received in a timely manner and I appreciate that.
2,WHAT to Think - Not HOW to Think,"I have worked through this curriculum as well as their ""Into the Word, Into the World"" curriculum.Both curricula have a terrible bias toward presenting the opinion of the authors as the truth, even when the curriculum posits an opinion that is diametrically opposed to the literal reading of scripture. Essentially, the curriculum tells the reader WHAT to think, instead of teaching the reader HOW to think.Particularly egregious are terrible bias against conservative Christians, the Jewish Faith, and a view that Moses authored the Pentateuch.If you are a liberal United Methodist who likes to tow the party line, this curriculum is for you. If not, consider other resources."
3,"It's not the original artist, but it's not bad.","This isn't the original artist(Harvey Dangerfield is), but it's got some alright remixes.There are several of these kinds of cd's out there, but if you want one, this is one to consider."
3,A Great Return. Randy Bachman Doing What He Does Best.,"Takes you back to the good times of 1973-75.""Another Fool"" is classic BTO. Buy it for that track alone !"
4,Excellent Date Flick,"Hugh Grant is one of the greatest ""chick magnets"" of our time (and Drew Barrymore is pretty decent eye candy for the guys). This is a fun, funny, well acted film with a believeable plot. Wonderful for that snuggle up evening at home. Nothing loud or violent. Best part - Hugh and Drew actually sing . . . and quite well! We bought the soundtrack CD too."
3,What a fun movie!,"Not what I consier to be a ""great"" movie, but I really LIKED this movie, I enjoyed it, I had fun with it! I really like Hugh Grant the more I see him, and Drew Barrymore's subtle grace and style and sense of fun make this a great date movie.For me, ""great"" movies are serious, intellectual, often tragic - and lousy date movies. This one was fun. Go for the ride. Stay for the romance.The Sure Thing"
4,Music and Lyrics,This was a wonderful product. I purchased it for my fiance who loves the movie and music.
2,Embarrassing,"I generally like Hugh Grant's romantic comedy movies, but this one was embarrassing. Grant plays a washed up pop singer milking his former fame at amusement parks and other shoddy venues. Drew Barrymore plays a supposedly quirky songwriter. I gave it two stars because the Indian doorman and the actress playing Drew's sister are funny. Grant tries, but the story is pathetic and the humor isn't there.Forget this. Go watch Love Actually, instead."
3,Music and Lyrics and ... (unfortunately) Tedium!,"A decent date movie.Hugh Grant is irresistibly funny as an ""80's has been,"" a former member of a boy-toy pop band that had its 15 minutes of fame twenty years ago. As he is reduced to doing theme parks and class reunions, the opportunity arises for him to taste the big time again by penning a song for the latest teen female singer.While Hugh Grant is engaging, the same cannot be said for Drew Barrymore, who is so hyper-neurotic that she belongs in a Woody Allen movie. Plus, she looks tired and washed out. The actress playing Cora is dead-on as a vapid, sexed up singer with Indian/Eastern/spiritual pretensions.For 90 minutes of bubble-gum escapism and a few semi-chuckles, ""Music and Lyrics"" might float your boat."
2,silly movie,"It is fun if you have nothing better to watch , some romance but really kind of stupid movie."
3,"Pop, Pop, Fizz,Fizz....","Since I've been with my wife I have to watch these rom-coms whether I like it or not. Some of them are tolerable (""Under the Tuscan Sun"") or pretty good (""The Holiday""). Alas, ""Music and Lyrics"" falls into the mundane category. It starts off alright hitting bulls-eyes about eighties pop culture. Hugh Grant is at his sarky self-depricating best here. I thought quite possibly there's going to be a ""This Is Spinal Tap"" style parody. Unfortunately, there's the most predictable love story afoot here. Grant is a real pro at carrying this most average of material. He should be doing more films like ""About a Boy"" instead of this formula product. Drew Barrymore, appealing as she is, doesn't seem to have the acting heft to carry it off. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the target audience for this movie. I deferred to my wife and she yawned and shrugged her shoulders with indifference. I guess the jury has spoken."
2,"Trite, repetitive....um, oh yeah, BORING!","Not a bad premise, but just uses all the romantic comedy cliches.I have to admit that Grant had some good one liners to keep it mildlyinteresting early. However, there is absolutely no humorous satire inthe whole Cora pop diva thing. Drew's ex-lover sub-plot was a dud as well. The 2nd half is almost entirely repetitiveand trite dialogue, and you have to hear that song they wrote so many times you want to just pass out. Overall, a lifeless effort, a rip-off."
2,Not Worth Watching -- or Listening to,"I normally don't mind Hugh Grant playing the same part in every movie he's in. He's charming enough to pull the whole befuddled guy who won't mature. Except in Lyrics and Music, a movie as generic as its title indicates. And even though Drew Barrimore is usually delightful, she can't save this wreck, with a lame plot and unfunny jokes. And what's with the girl who plays Cora? She's a terrible actress, on the plain side, and I couldn't believe for a second that she's a pop star--or a star of any kind for that matter. Couldn't they have hired anyone with at least a modicum of talent? Maybe they spent all the money paying Campbell Scott--at least, I do hope he got paid a lot; otherwise, what's the point of selling out?The introduction video --of the 80s band Pop-- is very funny and the song ""Don't Write Me Off Just Yet"" is beautiful, and those are the only two reasons I don't give this lame movie a one-star rating."
2,Drew is The Movie,"Before anything else I have to say that Drew Barrymore is just beautiful. I mean a woman who could look stunning on a worn out Tee with her hair pulled back, is just beyond us mere mortals.That being said...The movie definitely has its moments that might be considered as funny. The parody of Wham in this films opening scene, I think, is simply amusing. One cannot get enough of the bad fashion sense, choriography, and music video-making of the 1980's.That's just about it. I could see how some reviewer think the cinematography was done beautifully, because they were. I could see how others think that the songs were catchy, because they were. I just got lost with Hugh being funny. If anything, his performance here could be summed up as banal.The story line is unimpressive. The ending was such a cliche. It was just so plain."
1,faulty/dirty?,"this is the second disc of this movie that I have bought, the first wouldn't play at all and this one skips and seizes through the whole disc, I have run it through my cleaner twice with littleimprovement, I am sorry for it too, it is a cute moveie if you can watch it."
5,Hugh & Drew --A Winning Team!!!,"After seeing this movie all I have to say is I hope Hugh and Drew will continue to pair up again in other movies. Their onscreen chemistry was unmistakable. And besides the great music heard throughout the supporting cast Brad Garrett, Haley Bennet, Kristen Johnson, and Campbell Scott was equally amazing. For people who don't like Hugh Grant, this movie will change your mind!!"
3,Ok,I don't even remember buying this. I'm writing this review a few years after I apparently purchased it for someone on my list. Gave it 3 stars to be fair since I never saw it.
4,Infinitely better than I expected,I expected an extremely formulaic crass movie. What I got was a formulaic extremely funny and entertaining movie. This movie is not deep; which is kind of the point. If you want something fun and funny that you don't have to think too hard about- this is your movie.
4,Very good--at least four and one-half stars!,"Hugh Grant is terrific. He sings and dances and plays the piano, and we see sides to him that we have never seen before. Yes, his comedic talents are on display, as they have been brilliantly before, but the additions are worth the price of admission.Drew Barrymore is terrific too. She and Kate Hudson are the two most talented young comedic actresses today, and Drew shines in this film. Brad Garrett is great as well, playing Hugh's manager.It is a film about a washed-up singer-song writer of the 1980s, and the songs are wonderful. Rent the film and you won't be disappointed."
3,Stars keep it light and fun,"Hugh Grant looks and acts the part of a ""happy has-been"" who was a hit in the 80's but hasn't done much since. His agent (Brad Garrett) gets Grant the opportunity to enter a contest to write a song for the latest Britney-clone, a girl named Cora. His lyricist writes a dreadful song and Grant finds himself turning to his ""plant girl"" (Drew Barrymore) who spouts terrific lyrics while spritzing and watering his plants. Of course a romance ensues, which is complicated by artistic integrity (hers, not his.) The light touch of Grant and Barrymore plus the fact that the movie does not take itself too seriously is the saving grace for this film. It makes for a pleasant evening of entertainment."
5,No surprises equal Surprisingly good!,"This movie was cutesy, campy and trite. It was a cliche parody of itself from the beginning. And that is part of what makes it so wonderful. It doesn't try to pretend to be something it't not.Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are thrown together in the oddest and most unlikely of circumstances when Grant, a throwback to the 80's pop music scene, is offered a chance to write a song for an un-and-coming 21st century teen queen that is an almost annoyingly accurate parody of Shakira, Christina Aguilara and a host of other would be starlets you could name.When a struggling Grant can't seem to find the words to express his heart's melody, Barrymore walks in completing a pairing that is as wonderful personally as they are professionally.This is a darling comedy/drama/romance/whatever you'd like to call it... I highly recommend it!"
4,I have great insight...,Decently clean movie for adults. The romance was a little off kilter and there just wasn't enough of it. Wish the music would have been better. The bad guy really didn't have anything done to him *which is one of my favorite parts*. Music person meets lyrics person. One can't make it without the other.
4,Viva La Musica!!,"I thought this movie was very cute and funny! Yes, some parts are corny but sometimes corny is just what is needed! Drew Barrymore does a wonderful job in this movie. Her character is a talented song writer, although she doesn't know it. Hugh Grant is tolerable in this one, playing as the late pop sensation who is looking for another hit song. If you want something to watch after a hard days work and just have a good laugh MUSIC AND LYRICS is the best way to go."
4,An Enjoyable Movie,"This is an enjoyable bit of fluff. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore play well off each other, and the has-been angle (he's an 80's pop-star faded into obscurity) is fun. The song (Pop Goes My Love) is actually quite infectious, too. You'll find yourself humming it well after the movie is over."
4,Romance and Music,"What we need is more romantic comedies we can watch with loved one!Marc Lawrtence who wrote both Miss Congeniality films, writes and directs this romantic comedy about a has-been pop star (Hugh Grant) and a poet/plant waterer ( Drew Barrymore) write a song for a Britney Spears (before rehab) like pop diva (Haley Bennett)Romance blooms between Barrymore and Grant. They need to do another film together, because they have chemestry and it shows on film. Lawrence moves his actors in such a way that keeps you intriguedThe action is human emotion. There is romance in the air and in this film it works.Haley Bennett who plays the pop star and Brad (Til Death) Garrett as Grant's agent steal the film when they are on the screenSo want a cute romance, this is it!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
5,Excellent entertainment,"Music and Lyrics is, quite simply, a really good story. Drew Barrymore , Hugh Grant and Kristen Johnston were given good material and with it deliver real, down-to-earth performances. The music is catchy and credible as mainstream pop music, and all of it was performed by the actors themselves. And anyone who came of age in the 80s will instantly recognize Rhonda (Johnston) as someone they know (or perhaps are.)All of these elements combine to elevate this movie from the realm of formulaic ""chick-flick"" to that of an engaging and sweet modern-day fable."
4,Good little movie,"It's definitely a flick. Nothing exception, but nothing horrible either. I enjoyed it, it's a cute movie, but not one of my favorites from this year."
5,excelente,Realmente creo que esta sea la mejor comedia que ha hecho Hugh Grant. El està fantàstico y me parece que hace muy buena pareja con Drew Barrymore.El hecho de que sea una estrella Pop de los 80's me parece genial y sinceramente creo que la canciòn hubiera podido ser un hit de la època.A todos los amantes de comedia romàntica seguramente les encantarà.
1,Good Word...,I couldn't even finish watching this movie. It was horrible; everything about it. Sorry I bought it.
1,Boring and dull,"so this film over the weekend and it felt like so many of Hugh Grant's other films in that they might have a interest story line,but then they fall quickly and get so predictable and Boring nearly as quickly as you try to get into it. this film takes on the 80's and all the Synth Pop cliches and I've been down this road way more times than i care to remember. a forgettable film. very corny and more heavy on the cheese than the Pan Pizza at Pizza Hut. Drew Barrymore is just going through the motions here as well."
1,Absolutely horrible movie,"This is a horrible movie. We couldn't even stick with it for 15 mins., it was that bad. Horrible wooden acting. Bought it because of the featured actors. Now I can't even give it away."
1,Bloody awful,"This movie was absolutely awful. Hugh Grant plays a George Michaelish rock star and he is just awful at it. The movie is boring, boring, boring. I hated it."
2,I can't do all the work,"What I mean is that I am the world's most forgiving moviegoer. I think I have walked out of one film in my life. I love even bad movies and I never have a problem when a film asks me to beleive something unbelievable.However ... I do need some level of writing skill and some level of commitment from the actors. These two very attractive and talented people seemed to phone this one in, and it was more a sketch than a fully developed screenplay. There were a few good moments between Grant and Barrymore, but not enough to earn more than two stars. Recommended only for the hardest core fan of these two actors."
4,Classic Grant Movie,"I would recommend this Blu Ray to any Hugh Grant fan as this is classic, from the first few minutes at the start of when he is in his 80's bands pop video it had me and my Fiance in stitches. Drew Barrymore is also great in this and its a light easy to watch comedy, the picture and sound are also top notch which is to be expected on such a new release. So to summarise if you like Hugh and Drew get this."
4,"""...but then PoP goes my heart...""","Music and Lyrics starring Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore is surprisely entertaining, cute, and funny at times. This is not a perfect movie but I do enjoy that this movie is written and directed by Marc Lawrence (Miss Congeniality, Two Weeks Notice). The song in the beginning is so hilarious and Hugh Grant has never looked sexier but the only thing I didn't buy is the lack of chemistry between Grant and Barrymore, they seem more like good pals than potential love interests for one another. Anyway these talented actors carry the movie well and that actress who plays Britney-wannabe, Cora Coraman is strangely engrossing. I would recommend Music and Lyrics to anyone who loves preticable and yet engaging romantic comedies. Enjoy my little washed-up has-beens!"
4,H'Katzie,"Was a present for my husb, who enjoyed it, as we all did, at the beach one evening. Fun movie."
4,"Quriky, Lighthearted Romance","Drew plays a ditsy, somewhat eccentric character who is the unexpected love interest to Hugh Grant's ""80's Has-Been"". Both play their characters with natural ease. Althought the plot was somewhat predictable, the characters were unique enough and the jabs at the music industry and it's giant-size egos funny enough to make this a very enjoyable escape."
4,Music and lyrics,"I liked the movie! I didn't like the way it ended. When I saw how it ended. ""I was like that was it"" What kind of ending it that!I think the ended to me didn't seem like it was completed. It seem like there were more to it then what was there. Who knows maybe they left it that way so they can make a sequel. For the most part I like it sometimes I wanted to jump in the t.v to be that person that endes up meeting a star and falling in love!:)This film is a romatic comedy and will steal your heart away!I hope you will take my advice and get the movie!~Enjoy~"
4,Great Movie.,"Music and Lyrics is one of the good one's. It does an especially great job of bringing you back to the 80's. ""Pop! Goes My Heart"" should have been a top 40 song back then. Hugh and Drew are the best."
2,it's a romantic movie,"I won't knock this movie because romantic comedies just don't appeal to me very much. I went in with very low expectations and well, the movie wasn't very good to me. However, if you like romantic comedy flicks, this movie will sure to please you. For me though, the story dragged, the action scenes were few and far between, and nothing really exciting seemed to happen much.I DID like a few of the songs that played throughout the movie, so that gives my rating an extra star. The acting was nice, the characters were decent, and the movie is what it is."
3,"Good love story, okay picture quality, poor sound","If you're looking for a nice love story, this is a good one to watch. However, don't expect too much as far as sound is concerned. The disc comes with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound tracks only, but only 3.1 are used throughout the movie (barely any surrounds, which is weird since this story contains a lot of [good] music that should come in 5.1, but it doesn't. Picture quality (1080/24p) is okay, but certainly not reference material. Because of the poor audio, I am only giving it 3 stars."
5,Shipping and condition,Shipping was fast and easy and the condition of the dvd was in great condition as the seller said.
4,"A movie for a couple, no more no less...","Is a typical love movie, with a good storyline and some funny moments, like the POP musical video, you're going to watch it a lot, one because is fun and two because is really like an 80's video clip (resolution included)! The music of this movie is one of the aspects that is going to make you see the movie again, because is very sticky (that would make you to buy the soundtrack later...)!At the end, is a good movie for a couple, but no for more or less. This because is romance, and how his romance is showed is ust for couples (well multiple couples can see it, but is not the same)!"
5,Great Chick Flick,"I thought that this was a really cute movie, and no, I don't think there's anything wrong with cute. This is a chick flick and as such it is sappy and funny and predictable and has a happy ending...just as a chick flick ought to be. For those reviewers out there that are disgusted by the glorification of the pop industry, I would say that this is not a glorification of it, but rather a parody of it. I certainly got the idea from watching it (and perhaps you would have too if you had watched the entire thing) that great songs have heart and passion behind them and you don't have to sex it up to get people to like it.This was a good movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone who love good chick flicks. As a warning to parents, however, it does have some very sexual displays in the dancing and some of the lyrics are very suggestive so you may want to pass up on this one for the kids."
3,Good movie,"I like the softness of the movie. Not a good story line. But I wanted watch it because of the song ""All I want to"". The DVD was supposed to be widescreen. It felt like it was full screen. Other than that, it was good."
4,Romantic Comedy,"I've never seen any of the performers before, but the two stars make a delightful team, and the supporting players provide a variety of characters which add much to the proceedings. The music is the sort, historically, reminiscent of a period much earlier than the one assigned in the picture..but, who cares. Reality is not a dimension to be desired nor was any effort made to achieve it. This is fantasy and escape. Just what the doctor ordered in these parlous economic times. Good family viewing."
3,Music and Lyrics,"`Music and Lyrics' is a pretty standard romantic comedy and seeing Hugh Grant you pretty much know what to expect, bumbling charm and good one liners. This film does have some very funny lines in it, with excellent delivery from Grant and it has some great tongue in cheek comments on both 80's and modern pop music. It's worth watching this film for the opening 80's pop video alone and Hugh Grant is hilarious in 80's garb and showing his dated dance moves. The last twenty minutes or so were a little boring and the ending predictable, but you wouldn't expect too much else from a light hearted comedy. This is 100 minutes of charming chick flick and worth a look if you like that kind of film. It's even not that bad if you're a reluctant boyfriend who's talked in to watching it with a girlfriend or date. Light, cheesy and with some funny moments.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,Just ok,"My husband & I sat through this movie with serious doubts about what was going on. It wasn't what we thought it would be at all. I love both the actors, but the content of the show was pretty lame. For two, almost 50 yr olds, this just wasn't that great of a film. Slow at times, but funny at others, it was almost an ordeal to finish. Not something I would recommend except as a spoof on other musical shows."
3,"3.5...for a good, but nothing special movie","I'm a Drew Barrymore fan. I think she does cute very well. I'm not so much a fan of Hugh Grant, but he can be funny sometimes (he was awesome in 'About a Boy'). But I watched this the other night and it was a pretty ..ok..movie for a RomCom. The begging with the 80's music video for his group named PoP was pretty hilarious (specially the heart attack scene). The rest of the movie, was...I dont know..decent I guess. It had some ok chuckles in it. The chemistry between the two was somewhat believable.It really was your basic romantic comedy from A-Z.I'm not really dissing the movie, cause it wasnt terrible. It just didnt really make me want to remember it once it was done."
2,"Cotton candy for the mind. First, of all, if you paid $7-$8 at","the movies for this, I'm sorry. But as a rental, it's fine. Plus you get deleted scenes (not so good) & a gag reel (pretty funny). One of 1000's of recent romantic comedies from New York City. That said, Hugh Grant as Alex & Drew Barrymore as Sophie go through their paces, he as a faded aging pop-rock idol & she as a plant waterer & budding writer. Both have been screwed professionally. He, by his musical partner, she by her writing mentor. Both are too neurotic to do anything about it & never do. Fate throws them together to collabrate on a song for a Brittney/ Christinaesqe teen pop star. Hense the title. Plot seems familiar. It's a star driven flick. You know the rest: love, complications, angst & happi-ness. Worth waiting for. In the cheap rental bin I mean. Let's give it 21/2*."
3,Whatever - Not that great,"Yeah ok so its obvious that I did not fall in love with this movie. It made me wonder (during the film) why Hugh Grant was doing this kind of movie AGAIN. Won't somebody stop him? For his own good? And Drew Barrymore, come on she is also better than this script. But it was sometimes cute and occationally funny but as times passes I can not remember one funny or cute moment in this film. Forgettable fluff."
1,This Blew,"Terrible. It's really bad. Saw it on valentine's day. I threw up a little bit because of it. I mostly blame Hugh Grant, not so much Drew Barrymore."
5,One of the most extraordinary WW II documentaries...,"I certainly concur with Mr.Meminger's highest rating for this extraordinary documentary. The idea of seeing World War II in color is really quite astounding since our sensibilities are firmly formed in black and white. Showing the horrors of war,and even its poignancy, George Stevens Jr.'s narration along with the musical score by Carl Davis, makes for quite a compelling document. Even after watching this film 25 times or more, I am affected deeply by it with each viewing. I also recommend another documentary comprised of mostly color combat footage (and includes the Pacific theater, which ""D-Day..."" does not cover),entitled ""World War II In Color"" (available from Amazon.com), which was released in 1998 (90 min.). Incidentally, another WW II documentary, for which I cannot vouch, is also entitled ""D-Day to Berlin""--look for George Stevens Jr.'s name in association with the film in question. ""D-Day to Berlin"" is, quite simply, indispensable."
4,This is what Steve sounded like,"This is a solo recording of Steve Lacy playing soprano sax at Unity Temple. It was released by the rather small jazz label Wobbly Rail, owned and operated by Mac MacCaughan of the rock band Superchunk who also owns and runs a bigger indie rock label Merge (who discovered, among others, Squirrel Nut Zippers and Arcade Fire). I saw Steve Lacy in concert about six times starting in 1996 or so -- solo, with his wife Irene Aebi, with his trio, with his trio plus Roswell Rudd, and with his trio, his wife and George Lewis -- and this cd reminds me quite a bit of the performances I witnessed, of ""my"" Steve Lacy."
4,Saint Saga #13,"Further lightweight but entertaining short stories of the Saint (in the same vein asThe Brighter Buccaneer), wherein more mysteries are unravelled, more swindlers swindled, and more beer consumed.Unlike some of his contemporaries, Charteris appears to have been neither a snob nor an inverted snob (although ""The Noble Sportsman"" contains some blistering remarks about the Huntin', Shootin' and Fishin' ethos). Politicians, however, get a tremendous series of bloody noses from the Saint books, and captains of industry do not fare well either, as here in ""The Sleepless Knight"".Pat and Claud Eustace feature throughout, as usual; and Monty Hayward, Peter Quentin and (briefly) Dicky Tremayne drop in to remind us of old times.The story ""The Uncritical Publisher"" is missing from some editions, so be careful which you get.Variously published as ""Boodle"" and ""The Saint Intervenes"".P.S. For a list of — and discussion of — all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To... Guide."
1,Dated and only if you are a serious business person in Turkey,"I bought this book because I am doing business in Tirkey, but I found it fairly useless as a guide. Not much information of use, and too practical, unless you are the Chief Financial Officer of a Fortune 500, and even then you have scouts that can tell you everything this book says. A waste of my money"
2,"Not great, even for the price...","I got this guitar on sale for about $80.00... I just received it and wasn't impressed. I wasn't expecting the best guitar in the world, but I was pretty dissapointed when I opened it up. I was to give it as a Christmas gift, and frankly, I would have been ashamed to do so.Some of the edges of the guitar were rough... it was awkward to hold and play as well. The body is large and wide, with a short, wide neck. I have small hands, as does the person I would have given it to, making it very difficult to play. The strings appeared to be very cheap, almost like plastic. The pick guards came as seperate pieces that had to be place on like stickers!!!I'm attempting to send this back immediately. For an extra $25.00 I can go to Target and pick up a better made guitar...I'm not likely to order from A.B. ever again."
5,awesome,"i bought this for my two year old grandson. he loved it. very well made,really good construction.i would buy again in a heartbeat,also pretty easy to put together"
4,Perfect for my car loving nephew!,"This pedal car is adorable and made to last a long time. When putting this together we noticed the two front wheels wouldn't turn. We had to bend the frame that holds the petals and front wheels quite a bit to get it to work properly. Once it was all put together, it works well. I wish they would have made all gray and chrome parts either gray or chrome. It looks funny that some parts are chrome and others are gray.We are also making cushions for the bottom and back of the seat so its more comfortable.Overall, I think its adorable and my nephew is going to love it!"
3,Cute but not functional for the very young,"This is an adorable car, but very not functional for a young toddler. My son received it as a present at his 2yr b-day party, and just loved the bright paint job. (warning - this is very time consuming to assemble - not for the fainthearted, or the technically challenged). Unfortunately, he could not work the push pedals when we finally put it together, and he still can't (some 4 mths later); we end up just pushing him around the driveway while he sits in it. Once he is big enough to figure out the pedals, I am afraid he will be too big for the car. Cool car in concept, not so cool in operation."
1,Poorly Designed,"We purchased this car for our 4 year old grandson for Christmas. The car is so poorly designed that there are large bolts through the seat - the child can't miss sitting on them. When we tried to assemble the pump pedal to the wheels, the wheel repeatedly came off and could not be tightened enough for it to remain attached. Tighten the wheel enough to keep it attached and it would not turn. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Cool looking...Not so cool working...,"I bought this car last Christmas for my three-year-old son. I really don't recommend it. Assembly was a little difficult as some of the pieces are held together by small screws and bolts. A couple of these screws snapped when I was tightening them. I had to compromise when attaching the rear wheels to the pedal assembly. If I tightened the wheels too much, it was impossible to move the pedals. Even now, it is still difficult for my son to pedal. I would look for this item in a bicycle shop, and take a test drive before buying it online."
3,A nice shower curtain but...,"I like the look of this but was a little disappointed that it shrunk even following the washing and drying instructions. I had to lower my shower rod to adjust for the length. On the bright side, I get many compliments on the plaid."
5,Great chimes. Tiny criticism.,"This is a beautiful clock with beautiful Westminster and Whittington chimes. The nighttime silencer function will automatically turn the chimes off from 11 PM - 6 AM. I would really prefer that they come on later in the morning. The tiny volume wheel is very difficult to turn, and it is the only way to silence the chimes at other times. It needs to have an on-off switch. Overall, we love our clock, and our criticisms are minor."
5,Life is a Miracle,"Very enjoyable. Every time I listen to it, scenes of the movie come back to me. Best movie I have seen for years, made even better by the music."
3,3.5 stars for a worthy referencial work,"this book has an awesome collection of works by hot shot designers plus the 'receipe' for their displayed idea. this adds significant amounts of life and meaning and fun into this book. however, i cite it as a reference because most of the designed works in it are frozen in the past and will most likely need a rejuvenation process before long. the only timeless part in that book is the 'wit' section. this is something a designer must have to stay afloat in a continuously steeper competition. my rating goes for this only. again, 90% of the featured designs are the now dusty images of pentagram, the partners and the like. actual design doesnt look like this anymore. if that's what you're looking for, check out books by Metadesign, or Bruce Mau.do i advice you to get this book? if you're a designer, YES because our past is a rough draft for a better future and there's no use denying it. amateurs and computer-only freaks will not find this book helpful at all."
5,THE solution for creativity block...,"I've read tens of design books, yet this is the one I'd recommend if you were lost on an island and only had access to one.It contains some of the wittiest designs and creations, and takes a good stab at explaining what made them witty in the first place.If you want to get your creative juices flowing and innovate to the extend the world has never seen, this is the book to pray to.A pleasure to read from start to finish.Plus I got my copy almost free using a coupon from UnderTag.com"
3,"Ok quality, fast service","The book arrived within the time period that was promised, and it was nicely packed. The product was in good quality otherwise, but the front cover was aged yellow (probably because exposure to sun light). The condition of the front cover was not mentioned in the product description, but because it was a used book anyway, I'm ok with it."
1,When the brain farts,"I read the reviews, I like wit. I like deisign. thought that this wiuld be a good book for me to get. WRONG. The book is filled with lackluster designs using wit from the 80's and 70's. WIT is not an excuse for poor design. There are some good pieces, but most of them are out dated. Get this book if you want a history lesson about 80's design. The only good thing about the book are the interviews at the end and that is not worth the price of admission. Phaidon has done me wrong again. Will, no, can they put out a good book?"
4,Old fashioned but refreshing,"Although many of the ideas espoused by Elton in this book are very old fashioned and narrow-minded, such as his views on revisionism and newer trends in source criticism, the majority of the book deals with the subject in a refreshingly straight-forward manner. The language is, on the whole, very clear and the methodical approach in which he puts forward his arguments is very persuasive. I recommend reading this along side another historiographical work such as E. H. Carr's 'What is History?' or Richard J. Evans' 'In Defence of History'."
3,Nice looks,"But, while wearing it the traction to the floor is not so good, so you could slide just a bit. If that is not a concern for you, then these are wonderful slippers."
3,I don't know how,I don't know how to rate this. The customer service of this company was great. the clock on the other had was to fragile to shipped the it was packaged. I did like the clock though and the second only had minor damage from shipping and was able to be repaired
1,Bootiful? I think noot.,"One would have thought Mr. Matthews to have been the very last person to bring out a book on parasitology. The timing of this release, so close to Christmas, beggars belief. I for one will never buy any of his Turkey Nuggets again, if, as this book would have us believe, they are ridden with Ascarida galli and Capillaria amulata. That Crispy Golden Brown Breadcrumb coating you're chomping down on might not be what you expect. My advice would be not to buy this book but get some Pripsen in instead."
5,Required reading,"No one should call a business meeting without having absorbed this book's approach. Lots of simple, tested techniques to get results. Still valid after all these years."
2,Didn't get flag in picture,"I recently ordered this flag, but the one I received in the mail was different than the one they show in the picture. The one they sent me had a typo on it in which Culpeper was spelled with two p's: ""Culpepper."" Also, the flag which they sent me has the snake facing the wrong way: right instead of left. The original Culpeper flag is a great flag, unfortunately this particular version of it was not quality controlled very well. I'd spend an extra few bucks for a better one myself."
4,I love the history,I love the flag cause of the meaning and history of this flag and its some thing many people forget about and so on. I think if people bought flags like this ALL over and let others know what we think maybe the country will start rethinking..
4,Good for hanging indoors,"I bought this despite the reviews, just to see what I' get.Apparently, they've fixed the spelling issue. I live 30 miles from Culpeper,VA and think it's a cool novelty. I don't think this flag would last long if flown outdoors."
4,Plague among the Hawkenlyes,"A good outing for Clare, who is managing to make the People of the Woods into less than supermen, and Joanna is developing into more of a real person from what my older boy dismissed as a ""Mary Sue,"" i.e., an annoyingly perfect character. I will point out that the sickness in the novel appears to the physician to be more like Ebolavirus than Bubonic Plague, but I doubt the medievals could have told the difference."
5,Keith Urban Rox...24/7 with this DVD,"Great Keith Urban DVD! Wonderfully long with 3 additional songs from the sound check and soundbytes of Keith talking throughout. It's a must have for any devoted Keith Urban fan. If this doesn't inspire you to attend one of his live shows, nothing will! It's all about the music...it's all Keith...it's awesome! You even learn what his favorite ""word of the day"" is on this dvd, and the subsequent teasing he receives and how well he accepts it...endearing! :D"
5,"Keith Urban ""puts you smack dab in the middle of paradise....""","""Livin' Right Now"" is a excellent DVD of what a concert DVD should be...showcasing the performer doing what he loves doing best and no one does that better than Keith! He sings, writes, plays, interacts superbly with the audience. Whoever said his crowds are 90% women, there are a lot more males than are given credit for...C'mon, guys, quit lurking and come out with it. It's OK, to like Keith's music with your wife/girlfriend/female friends..."
2,WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ?,"I'M SORRY BUT AFTER VIEWING THIS DVD I JUST WASN'T IMPRESSED. THE WOMEN LOVE HIM AS WITNESSED IN THIS DVD BUT AS FAR AS THE SHOW GOES, IN MY OPINION, IT'S JUST AVERAGE SOPHMORE STUFF.....CMT PROMOTES HIM BUT I'VE SEEN MUCH BETTER SHOWS WITH A LOT LESS HYPE.............."
4,contagious fun,"Fine production really reveals Urban's talent and connection with audience.Great set of songs , will iniate the unfamiliar with this artist.Perfect for a upfront view of this versatile musician and his band. Highly recommended.PJC"
5,Awesome for any music fan!,"I just recently became interested in Keith Urban. I saw a special on CMT with part of this DVD on it and from the moment I began watching I was hooked! In every way possible Keith is a wonderful entertainer. I am absolutely amazed by the DVD because he is even better live. You really get a chance to see how passionate and talented he is when it comes to his guitar-playing. I get even more blown away every time I watch it. I also really enjoy getting to know him more as a person because his interaction with the crowd shows his great personality. Even if you aren't a country music lover, I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy this DVD and appreciate Keith as a musician and entertainer."
4,A breath of fresh air...,"I saw an article on BYOP in the Washington Post. After reading the article I went to their website and checked out a few samples...which led me to buy the CD. I have to say this is a breath of fresh air. BYOP has shattered the mindcontrol of the mass media that has forced so many teenagers to form bands that are nothing more than clones of all the other bad emo, screamo and corporate backed psuedo-punk (Good Charlotte and Green Day are prime examples). Now normally, I don't listen to this type of music, I am a die hard metalhead. BYOP is a brilliant addition to the music world. They have made a fan of this metalhead."
1,"You get what you pay for,","Which is a lame punk band full of kids. The only song worth a listen is track 5 and it isn't even a punk song. Track no. 6 stole their guitar sounds from Mudhoney, and basically (this is coming from a big punk fan) all the songs sound the same. If you want some good girl punk buy Le Tigre or Distillers. These 17 year olds think that because they swore enough to get a parental advisory sticker on their album that they are punks.What these kids didn't understand is that when punks grow older their music becomes more structured and melodic (i.e. better). BYOP is going to end up down the No Doubt road of bad music to worse (Gwen Stephani's sweet solo album is an exception)."
