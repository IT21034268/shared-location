1,"Terrible, terrible CD","This is a really bad pop-punk CD. It's especially disappointing in light of the fact that one of the members, Jim Mathus, is a leader of Squirrel Nut Zippers. Metal Flake Mother is nothing like SNZ and is in fact a bad imitation of most of the other pop punk from the early 1990s."
1,Useless.,"These are not KVM cables. It is a set of a DVI-I cable, a USB cable, and a molded speaker/microphone audio cable. Not only is it a spaghetti nightmare, but cables get separated and lost. Had I not already invested in 4 Avocent cable sets, I'd be buying theStarTech KVM ones, which are also cheaper."
4,Federico Fellini buffs take note!,"Ciao Bella!Ye Gods! Newman is a fiendishly clever polymathic (sic?) confabulatory yarn spinner. Do ya like Alternate History? Do Ya like Vampires? Do Ya like Fellini, Il Maestro? If the answer is yes or even 'well maybe' to any of the above questions, then check out Newman's Anno Dracula stuff. Prior installments not neccassary, but recommended. Never have Vespa Scooters, sunglasses and blood drinking been so amusing, sexy, fun and witty. If you love playing 'spot the reference', you'll have a ball (Clark from Kansas and Gomez Addams, anyone?) Also features an exteneded cameo, nay a supporting role even, by a character stand in for the late great MARCELLO MASTROIANI, for my money to coolest thespian even to commit his immortal soul to celluliod, although I'm not sure I've spelled his name correctly (!). Also, Velvet Undergrounf fans are in for a small treat too..."
3,Dracula Cha Cha Cha,"I did not know that this was the same book as Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha. Since I ordered the OTHER book at the same time, I ended up with two exactly the same books except for the title. It would have been nice for that to have been listed somewhere in the description. But it wasn't."
4,Great story - lousy ending,"Kim Newman should be shot for doing the same thing in this novel that he did in its 2 predecessors - give it a lame ending. The fact that I still gave it a 4 star rating, and read the book after seeing what the author did to the 2 prior books in the series gives you an idea how much I like his stories.The problem is that Kim Newman can't write a decent ending to save his life. The 3 books I've read in this series are all the same - great story, interesting characters, fascinating alternate history. Then, for the last 50 or so pages, the story sputters and peters out in a bit of introspective hogwash. Newman is like a pilot who can take off and do incredible aerobatics, but just can't land the damn plane."
3,"A good listen, but jazzy.","Phil Coulter's renditions of these well known Scottish tunes are very different from any other CDs I have heard. They are a little heavey on the jazz side, but still enjoyable. The last track is my favorite, and is the only one with bagpipes. If you are looking for a bagpipe CD, don't get this one."
1,What a disappointment!,"Phil Coulter is a brilliant musician and composer, but this effort does not begin to meet the standard set by any of his other work. Many of the arrangements of these too-familiar Scottish tunes are uninspiring and unappealing--artistic license having been taken too far afield. Unlike the other Phil Coulter albums which I play continually, that touch my heart and awaken the cianlas, this album will remain on the shelf."
1,This CD is NOT for the serious listener!,"I'm going to offer this CD to my dentist, as I think it's the sort of thing you would want to play for someone while giving them gas... It's pleasant enough if you want background music that won't distract people from their conversations.I had expected music that would stir my soul, but this is a contrived collection of worthy compositions, toned down to mere melodies and jazzed up with mis-used percussion. There's no depth to this music.It seems the people who most enjoyed this CD were those who associate it with very real, very positive memories of their own experiences. I don't mean to disparage their opinions; it's just that, for me, the music must stand on it's own merit."
5,"Soothing, Relaxing, and very well done.","If you like soft piano music, you'll love this CD. It is very well done. Being Scottish melodies, I expected more bagpipes, but they only show up on the last song. This CD is definitely a good buy. I listen to it every evening while I'm studying, or reading for pleasure."
5,Well-written,"What a marvelous read! I was so surprised to find that this book was published by Harlequin. My impression has always been that Harlequin books are inferior. I'm happy to admit that, in this case, I was wrong. Landon has drawn truly memorable, likeable characters. Their relationship is fraught with misunderstandings as the two childhood acquaintances get to know one another again as adults. But, those misunderstandings are not frustrating to read, as is often the case in other books. Landon is such a skillful writer that she develops their relationship in a slow but satisfying way, allowing the reader to understand each of the characters better while the characters themselves are learning more about each other as well. Landon also moves plot along quickly with lots of intrigue and adventure. Very, very good read."
2,Don't Believe the Other Postings!,"This is a coffeetable book about porn. Chapter One is well-written, but the rest of the book degenerates into an almost play by play analysis of Ryker's films. I did not know anything about this man before I read this, and afterwards I know some trivial things but not much else. It will sit on my shelf for a while, and I do like the pictures, but it did not give me much insight into anything. I would suggest this for fans, and those who need a pornographic coffeetable book!"
3,ken ryker,i want to have a look of inside before buying it. i like ken ryker a lot but this one is i think the best but have a look of inside first
3,Promises to tell all and delivers,"""The Films of Ken Ryker is a fun and interesting read from beginning to end. A book that promises to tell all and delivers!"" -Jeff Green, Twink magazine (West Hollywood)"
3,Unzipped review,"""Even if you've never heard of Ken Ryker (is that possible?), you'll take away a load of pleasure from this well-crafted celebration of his life and porn career."" -Tony Palermo, Unzipped (Hollywood)"
2,A Handheld dissapointment,"After Guerrilla Games made the underrated shooter Killzone for the PS2, they decided to make a 3rd person game. Although its a shooter, the aiming is awful, and the melee hardly works when it should. The environments are cool and the graphics are great for a psp game, but with the clunky combat combined with the boring and mediocre storyline makes for a poor installment for an otherwise fun playstation franchise. Unless your a hardcore killzone fan and/or you love unnecessarily difficult games, do not buy this."
3,"Frustrating and unfair, sadly","I could not wait to get this game in the mail, as the reviews seemed pretty good, but it does not live up to the hype. I really wanted to like it, but the targeting is so touchy that you basically have to run directly at the enemy to get a lock on them, exposing yourself in the open. Also there are too many times where an enemy is unseen offscreen, yet he sees you and kills you as soon as you get in his sight. Dying is way too easy with hidden land mines, grenades, and little ""spider"" mines that are impossible to outrun. You get a total of one weapon at a time and 2 grenades, and when there gone, you have to run back across half the map to find a locker, and oh, there happens to be another trap that wasn't there last time you passed by. Too frustrating to be fun for very long. Rent, don't buy."
3,Fun to play but too easy to complete,"I really did enjoy this game but the whole experiece took no more than 2 days to complete all situations, levels, and all collectible monies. I do realize that now I'm suppose to find other gamers to go online and connect with to get to other levels... but that is just not my situation. I purchased this entire system for long trips and filling dead time in a busy day. I would avoid this game if you are looking for a good, challenging, and fun sigle player game. I have no experience with the multi-player or the online versions, so will leave the honor of reviewing these sections to others. Hope this helps.."
2,Feels like work,"Wow, this game really sucks. The graphics are OK, but despite all the bugs (e.g. getting shot through walls) and the general inadequacy of play (e.g. your guy, after locking on an enemy and shooting to the point that they're ALMOST dead, will then automatically STOP shooting the near dead enemy and automatically lock onto a much fresher enemy, making your job MUCH more difficult because the guy that SHOULD have been finished off is not and will now continue to shoot back at you). My least favorite part was that crappy hovercraft you have to ride in... overall there are MUCH better games out there that do NOT feel like WORK. Save your hard-earned money and get a game that is actually FUN to play."
3,Just a Tad Disappointed,"The aiming controls could have been a lot better for this game and another thing, Why isnt this game in First-person like the original killzone?If it was in first person, i would be a whole lot happier. Im only on level 4 on easy mode and i cant beat this part because the are helghan commandos and as tank shooting at me at the same time!Maybe im not trying hard enough but the game could be a lot better!There arent even Bots in multiplayer! I was awfully disappointedBut the parts that are actually beatable are pretty cool. It could have been a lot better! 3 stars"
4,Killzone,This game is very entertaining and terrbily challenging. I would recommend playing in a padded room because when you get towards the end of the game you will probably get so frustrated as to throw your psp against the wall...
2,"Frustrating, and ultimately - a disappointment.","I have to agree with one of the reviews in here. The miserable controls & aiming; hidden land mines that are hard to get around (in case you've spent your generous amount of TWO grenades); spider mines that are impossible to run from (and almost always end up killing you); only one weapon, which is usually useless because of long and frequent reload times - all result in an incredible disappointment, and a really HARD game even on the 'Easy' difficulty level. But not because it's challenging, but because of game design flaws I mentioned above.So, welcome to clicking ""Restart Checkpoint"" for the 110th time. And then die because of a Helghast rocket launcher or a mine...and then repeat."
4,Pretty good...,"Brooklyn Rose was not Ann Rinaldi's best, but was a good book. It takes place in a quaint town in South Carolina. Rose's father's friend, who is a silk importer from France, visits and falls in love with Rose. They marry and move to his house in Brooklyn, New York, Rose faces troubles with getting aquainted to being a housewife. It's pretty short, so there's not much to it, but it's okay."
3,an alright story,I didn't think that this was one of Rinaldi's best. It was nice story line and I liked the fact that she based it on her grandmother's life. I didn't like the end when Rose ran away like a child but I'm glad that they were still together in the end. It wasn't a bad book just not one of my favorites.
2,Not Rinaldi's best...,"As a teen, I eagerly ate up Rinaldi's historical fiction novels. So recently when I found one of her books I hadn't read I was excited. However, I found this book lacking. Rose Frampton, the 15 year old main character, is based on Rinaldi's own grandmother, but she never fully materialized as a character to me. She was more like a shadowy outline that needed to be filled in. I certainly thought that the diary format would make it easier for us to get inside her head as she experienced major life changes, like her older sister marrying, and she herself marrying an older man from Brooklyn. At least it was on the shorter side."
3,Not Rinaldi's best,"I enjoyed Ann Rinaldi's books when I was younger so I thought I'd pick up a couple more of hers since I love historical fiction.I know that times were different in the 1900s and that girls oftened were married young. However, having a 30 ...more I enjoyed Ann Rinaldi's books when I was younger so I thought I'd pick up a couple more of hers since I love historical fiction.I know that times were different in the 1900s and that girls oftened were married young. However, having a 30-something professing his love for a 15-year old really bothered me as did the fact that after they were married, he called her ""child.""And of course, there's the ending, or lack of. The book was relatively short so why not add a chapter or two of what happened with the baby and Charlotte?"
5,"Excellent book, should be required reading","This book is an excellent collection of information on child abuse, covering subjects from the history child abuse to specific types of child abuse to rehabiliation to prevention, and much more. Although this edition is a bit outdated and thus lacks some of the more recent information and research, it's still highly relevant and in my opinion should be required reading not only for doctors, psychologists, and school teachers, but also for anyone who interacts with children, and indeed, the entire population."
1,Why is this so hard to understand?,"Objectivism is the name that Ayn Rand gave HER philosophy. If you change it's fundamentals around, it's no longer Objectivism. If I want to change Objectivism so it includes religion, or astrology or faith, that new philosophy I created is no longer Objectivism. Kelley wants to do just that. Change fundamentals, but still get away with calling it Objectivism. That's about as dishonest as you can get.If you want to understand Objectivism, read Ayn Rand's books.If you want to learn about Kelleyism, read Kelley's books.But do not confuse the two."
2,doesn't see the wood for the trees.,"This book often inspires a fresh take on the standard repertoire,more alive than the average analysis book.It's easy to understand why Schuller has carved a reputation as a composition teacher-Bainbridge,Weir and Knussen from the UK alone!Alas,the central thrust of 'The Compleat Conductor'-that conductors often deviate from the letter of the score(shock,horror!)....becomes weary and pedantic in the end.Schuller really doesn't see the wood for the trees and his arguments aren't as watertight as you might think as some of the other reviewers have shown."
4,minor gripe with the packaging,"Decent box set overall, but it loses a star for the packaging. The cases that the DVDs come in are not well put together. Both the season 1-5 and 6-9 dvd ""books"" came apart when I was going through them. Should've been packaged in paperboard envelope books like the Friends box set..."
2,seinfeld complete series,"I bought the complete seinfeld series from amazon in september 2009. I love the series, but I am very sad with the recording of the dvd, specially the whole 4 season, it cant be read on my hp laptop computer, and is not the computer fault because I can read the other seasons. Bad recording? bad dvd ?? I dont know, but is a shame."
5,Excellent,I purchased the complete series of Seinfeld for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. We are both huge fans of Seinfeld and I would completely recommend it for any Seinfeld fan. We have really enjoyed the coffee table book which gives you information and extra facts you otherwise wouldn't have known from just watching the episodes. Great buy and I am so glad I found such a great deal on Amazon.
5,Hoochie Mama! This is the Daddy!,"Having been a HUGE Seinfeld fan for the past 15 or so years, the complete box set was a must have.Sure, there are people moaning about having bought all of the previous individual sets who are now upset that there is a complete box set, but come on, that's the natural order of things. First they release the individuals - then the boxset. It's basic capitalism unfortunately.Anyway I digress. Whether you have waited for this incredible compendium or are flip flopping back and forth trying to decide whether to buy the box set as well, let me say - HELLO! buy it!With the coffee table book thrown in, a very sleek and slender double DVD case for all of the discs, and the fact that Seinfeld has to be the greatest TV programme in history, this is an absolute no brainer!So in conclusion, if I haven't been clear - buy it!"
4,As expected!,The complete series of Seinfeld is a great addition to any DVD library. It comes with a very handy coffee table book summarizing the episodes and pointing out some very interesting facts.
3,AMAZING show...however Price fluxuates like gas,"I was going to give this a 1 star rating but I love seinfeld way too much, my issue with this listing on amazon is that the price on this product when sold by amazon can go between 100-215 dollars. Im telling you put this on your wish list and watch almost every 2 days the price either dips or rises. Please... if you interested in this product... DO NOT BUY unless its at least under $130. I would hate to be anyone paying more than $130 for this item."
4,Great Box Set,"If you like Seinfeld then this is obviously a great deal and a great box set.I just wanted to make this review to warn potential buyers that the box, the coffee table book, and the DVD holders are all layered with some sort of rubbery felt material that smudges / stains very easily and there is nothing you can do to remove it.Be careful with it when you buy it if you like to keep your things in pristine condition. I'm a bit disappointed in the packaging and the ease with which it permanently smudges so I thought I might at least warn others."
5,Seinfeld Complete Series- get it!,"The only way to give Seinfeld is to give the whole series! It comes nicely boxed, doesn't take up a lot of space considering there are 32 dvds, and it makes for easy accessibility without a lot of extra stuff you don't need or want."
3,all a matter of good packaging and honesty,"I bought this item twice, once as a present and once for myself.From the same seller.The first shipment was packed in a reasonable manner, not really good, because this refridgerator pack is what it's all about, and it was dented and chipped.So when ordering the next time, I asked the seller directly to pack it in a more sturdy box, which he did, lots of styropor foam to buffer, but now the packaging was ( again) dented and even had a small hole in the corner.Since they forgot to take out the pin, probably this one had been on display in their store and the pin was to communicate the price.I feel robbed because this was not mentioned at all.Since I live in Europe, it was easy for this seller, because how am I going to complain? Well: The product is fine, the seller was not honest enough on the state of the fridge, the one and only reason to buy this unit.Definitely not worth my USD 200,- !!"
2,Episodes?,There are several episodes missing. Especially the one where they go to India. That's my all-time favorite episode. I also had missing discs and duplicate discs. Blah...so disappointed!
1,Bad quality DVDs,"All the other 1 star reviews are about how unfair it is to offer a new package with more content when ""true fans"" have bought all the other series as they came out one-by-one. Welcome to the utterly evil world of marketing and Sony's truly despicable goal of turning a profit. Get real.My gripe is this: the DVDs are terrible. They are of very low quality, episodes often freeze for seconds and do that crazy digital pixelation thing frequently. I got this as a Christmas present from my wife but soon returned it when I saw the state of the discs. Got a whole new set and they act pretty much the same way. And before you think it's my DVD player - I have about a 100 DVDs in my collection and they all play perfectly. I am a HUGE Sienfeld fan, which is why this is so annoying. Hence the 1 star rating. Shame on Sony for using such trashy hardware on the amazing work of genius that is the Seinfeld series."
5,Great gift!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend.He, being a crazy Seinfeld fan, believes it is the best gift he's ever received.I'm not crazy about the show, but the whole package is awesome and I bought if for a great deal ($100). Being that it's all 9 seasons, it is very compact and the whole leather-ish holder isn't an eye-sore.Definitely a perfect buy for those Seinfeld-fanatics!"
3,HELP,"can i play these dvd's in Europe or is this only for US? if so please let me know, these dvd's are far too expensive in Europe . thanks"
1,Carefull when you shop for cheaper prices,I ordered this product but had to return it back because it had two of the same disc and thus was missing one disc.
3,another box set!!!,"Agree with the other reviewers. I have purch the 1st 5 seasons of Seinfeld, 8 of King of Queens and 8 of Raymond. Now lo and behold all of them come in one neat little package. Same thing happened to me with Friends! Live and learn. You've got to hand it to the studios though, they know the true fan and collector will get the individual seasons and then will also have to have the ultimate, complete box set, like myself. I will probably wind up selling the individual seasons either at a yard sale or ebay, take my lumps on the price and then use that to purchase the all in one set!..Luckily, there are no more series that I truly enjoy any more worth purchasing and if there was, i would certainly wait for the end to make the one purchase.The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of the fact this product comes out now after all the single seasons. Just frustration and not a comment on the show itself"
1,Most unfunny show ever created,"This show is so lame that they had to add laugh tracks because no one would laugh otherwise! All of the jokes are stale, immature and the characters lack depth. For great sitcoms check out Full House or anything with Lord Saget, Mind of Mencia, Charles in Charge, All-American Girl (with Margaret Cho!), Baby Bob and Even Stevens."
4,Missing an Episode,really enjoying watching all these fabulous shows but seem to be missing the episode in the third seasonThe Stranded... ? anyone else missing it? it's supposed to be after The Nose. It's the one where Elainesays 'maybe the dingo ate your baby'... i want to see it and am not happy it's not there!!anyone else ?
5,Simply the best!,"I can't add anything that hasn't been said before - I can merely concur that Seinfeld was a tremendous show, and that this DVD set is awesome."
5,9 Seasons about nothin',"The ultimate in TV comedy box sets. The coffee table book only enhances the ""Seinfeldian"" experience. This is a must."
4,Good price but,I am a life long Seinfeld fan. No complaint except the case has two corners folded and damaged. Amazon sent me a damaged product. But good price.
4,Love Seinfeld.. This set is great.. Misleading advertising though,I was super excited to get this on the gold box deal of the day before christmas for $85. I am glad I didn't pay full price. The bonus features aren't all that really. The shows of course are awesome. What I was most disappointed in was that it said the official coffee table book. Well anyone that watches Seinfeld is expecting a book about coffee tables that folds out into a coffee table as Kramer designed it. Well it is a book abou Seinfeld. That's great and all but I think it is a little misleading. I have seen several reviews from people expecting the same thing I was. Overall I still got a wonderful set of DVD's that we will watch over and over.
5,"I felt so guilty, but then so GOOD","I loved this when I was growing up. It was so risque! I have been holding off buying these complete set for years, because it seems so self indulgent to do so. But I am so glad I did. I work from home, and having these episodes on while I work really makes the time fly. Plus they are so well put together you can watch them again and again. Seasons 1 and 9 aren't that great, but it's fun to see the show finds its way and Season 9 has more great moments than you might think. I say if it makes you feel good, do it! Buy the whole set!"
4,Seinfeld Complete Series,"The set is nice. The coffee table book is worth buying the set rather than the individual seasons. However, I will say that I was disappointed with the cases for the discs. The plastic cases are stuck in a cover with double-sided tape, which doesn't hold well at all. The set is worth it, but you will probably be upset if your discs fall out of the case and scratch. Just be careful when you are handling the set and it will be fine. Would definitely buy again."
1,Overpriced,"This is one of the greatest series of all time and I highly recommend it... However, I do not understand why ""Seinfeld the Complete Series"" is currently priced at $199.99 when the total price of seasons 1-9 purchased as individual items only totals about $93. Is the bonus DVD and the special complete series cardboard box really worth the extra $107? I'm really not understanding the price point here."
5,Awesome Package,"I originaly wanted to purchase this set but I received it as a birthday gift instead. The series is awesome. I love how it comes with all the episodes. The coffee table book included is also great because it gives a short description of all the episodes, incase you don't remember something. Finally I can watch any episode I want anytime and with no commercials. One more thing, the whole series is neatly packaged in a good sized box no more bigger than a shoe box so it doesn't take up very much space. This set truly is the best. Love it."
5,"Seinfeld ""Is Complete""","Just a quick review - Seinfeld is one of my favorite shows from TV. After it arrived we started watching it when there wasn't anything on cable, and Seinfeld is addicting! There are so many unforgetable show - you will enjoy it. It brightens one's day!"
5,Great.... Simply Fantastic,"I love Seinfeld, i have the backround, the icons, the screensaver, i needed something to complete it, and, though you may or may not believe this, i almost cried when i heard they were stopping the show, and i know it's kinda strange, but i almost did, now with this series, its great, and, when on the show Kramer made the coffee table book, i said to myself, i want that, but i also thought, maybe i just liked it because of the little legs, would i actually read the coffee table part, Not Really? but when i saw they added the coffee table book, WITH THINGS ABOUT THE SHOW!!! wow!!! that's what i wanted, and at this price, 127$, 49% off!!! wow, i had to get it."
2,Disappointed,"As per the picture you have here, the word ""Seinfeld"" at the top is ""gold"" but what I recived was not! Worst of all, my box is dented in several places, doesn't look ""in mink condition"" or new to me. Finally, for both my CD sets, the CD casing actually delaminated from the box. Is there any way I can get a replacement? I am a Seinfeld fanatic and I bought this solely for collection only. I actually have another complete set I use for watching. I am obviously disapointed and take no pride is displaying this collection. Can someone at Amazon get back to me on this please?Disapointed Alan"
5,Exceptional!,"This is one of the holly gifts God sent us. It's a ""must have"" for all Seinfeld fans. You can never stop watching those four friends. Boguht it one day it was in the Gold Box because I didn't know it existed. Would've bought it at it's full price also.PLUS: Bring a ""Coffe Table Book"". Hahahahaha"
5,seinfeld the best show ever,i wasnt so inpressed with it i thought the season would come in somthing more sterdy like book insteed on dvd piled on one another in a little booklet the says season 1-5 and 6-9 i shoulda came in somthing like a book our just somthing else i own tons of series ans that was a little down but and the coffie table book didnt have leggs i dont know if its just me but that bugg me they atleased coulda but little plastic legs our somthing but i will say the speacail features are amazing tons and tons of amazing bloopers delted scenes and interview with the actors about the episodes
4,Very Good,"This product arrived before the time expected, in about three weeks in ordinary shipping here in Rio, Brazil.But it didn't arrived in perfect conditions: there is a little damage to the box. Maybe it was already there before the shipping, maybe not. But it is really small, so I am satisfied.Besides it was really cheap (on the ""deal of the day"")!"
3,I'm shocked!,"I'm shocked that those CDs don't display on a Japanese DVD players! The CD worked on my laptop but i couldn't play them on my DVD player (LG elctronics). Otherwise, i would have loved everything on it."
2,crap!,well i bought this last winter. jsut recently started watching it and it is missing discs.. the box set looks like it was put together in someone basement. the labeling was upside down. and the discs hoders themselves have begun falling apart! save your money.
5,The Complete Seinfeld,"Always loved Seinfeld, and it is wonderful to have the entire set so beautifully boxed."
5,Seinfeld--complete series,"I found the set to be everything I hoped it to be except for the packaging. I am never completely satisfied with the packaging of complete sets of any TV series, so, in all honesty I cannot, cite the Seinfeld series for less than desirable packaging--it is true of all sets of TV series. What can I say? If you like Seinfeld this is the most economical way to get the whole series. It is high quality and you will be more than satisfied if you are a Seinfeld fan. I certainly would buy it again. Charles J."
4,Seems a little off,"When I first put in the DVD from Season 1, it seemed like this DVD set was bootlegged. The menus are simple looking and the quality of the video isn't the best. But it turns out, this is just how the studio produced these DVD's. So if you buy this, don't be alarmed that it seems cheap. It's not the product itself.The one thing that doesn't seem cheap is the coffee table book that comes with the collection. It has great info for every single episode. I consider myself a real fan of the show and I even learned some things from it. Great buy from Amazon gold box!"
4,"Discs are great, but Coffee Table Book is lacking","The DVDs are great. They have everything you would expect and everything the other reviewers have noted. So, I won't badger this review with a ton of repeated information.There is one thing to note. This set is advertised with the mythical Coffee Table Book that Kramer created that becomes its own coffee table. The book included in the package DOES NOT become a coffee table. They could have/should have added legs that can fold out, like Kramer's book did.Otherwise, this a fantastic product!"
5,awesome,"quick shipping, exactly like the description, no problems with the product and a very decent price. overall just great. thanks!"
5,Seinfeld The Series,"Excellent seller. Had a problem with a disc missing in the SEALED package, and seller promptly and professionally corrected. I would strongly recommend."
2,Use only in conjunction with a current map,"We recently used this guide in selecting a short day hike. The loop we selected came across as very straightforward so we took off without consulting additional maps. We were annoyed to find ourselves off the loop twice after coming to trail junctions not included in the guide map. Upon returning home we looked at another guide book we had considered 'out of date', only to find that both trail junctions where we had been misled were clearly marked."
3,Good stuff,"This is actually the first really old violin swing album I've added to my collection. Just got it a few days ago......it's actually a double CD-set. The recordings are quite old....and I truly think that a little more energy could've been put into re-mastering them.......the music is good, but some of the songs are just difficult to hear......if you can't hear music, then what good is it? If you're an old music fan like me, then it'll be a valued addition to your collection."
4,"An amazing, yet little known talent!","This album is an all instrumental album. While still quite good I prefer her songs with lyrics. When she comes to town, go see her live while she is still playing the small clubs. The stories she tells in concert add even more to her songs."
2,"Great Product, BUT!!!","This product works wonderfully but, why would you make a bed wetting watch for a potential client that is 4 years old, slap a $100 pricetag on it and NOT make it water proof??? Kids that age are not going to have the forsight to take it off all the time."
1,Do not buy this watch!,"I may have received a lemon, but this watch is horrible. I have read through the instructions multiple times. Each time that I attempt to set the first alarm, the screen goes blank and takes a day or so to return to the normal screen. I tried to exchange the watch, and a month later, the very same watch was returned to me, saying that ""technicians replaced the batteries and did rigorous diagnostic testing and the watch passed all tests"". After having the very same problems, I went online to return the watch, and now received an email from the company saying, ""I will call you direct to troubleshoot your watch"". So it is clear that the company is not going to make a return easy, either. I would not buy anything from Just Home Medical and especially not this watch!"
4,Guilty Conscience,"I see a number of essay-length reviews of this movie, which makes sense, as the movie is indeed deep and complex - yet for the sake of those simply seeking a concise review, I will keep it brief.The movie has a dark and uncollected tone. Christian Bale plays Trevor Reznick, a man who is unable to sleep and who has become malnourished and emaciated. His inability to sleep causes him great trouble and leads him in and out of reality until he is brought back to the source - that which has caused his troubles and his insomnia: his guilt.Bale gives an unbelievable performance in this film. I can't imagine it ever being worth what he did to himself physically, though. He simply starved himself for the role. You would think this would have horrible repercussions (and I'm sure it did), yet he seemed to have made a full recovery by the time he played Bruce Wayne in Batman."
5,Kafkaesque Thriller,"Christian Bale is shocking to see in this film about a man who is skeleton-thin and sleepless due to mysterious causes. As his character Trevor explores the strange goings-on that threaten to close in around him, the viewer is inexorably drawn in and dragged along. Thankfully, this film has a satisfying ending which explains a lot of what went before. The Machinist is startling and well-crafted movie."
4,From a clinical perspective...,"I watched this movie for the first time in my differential diagnosis class in grad school. The movie perplexed me until the very end when it all became crystal clear. SPOILER ALERT: Throughout the course of the movie, Trevor was suffering from PTSD. Anyone who knows about this disorder can tell you that every symptom: sleeplessness, memory disruption, weight loss, changes in interpersonal relationships, hallucinations, etc., could be explained by PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). In the end, it becomes clear that the accident which he was responsible for, was so psychologically damaging that he lost memory of the event. One could also argue that Trevor suffered from a dissociative disorder as well, which may also help explain how he remained unaware of the incident for so long. Anyways, as a psychologist I found this movie to be very thrilling and full of surprises. While it was personally horrifying seeing Christian Bale in that role, it was a very good movie!"
3,A little hard to watch...,"Christian Bale deserves kudos for his portrayal of this character, which undoubtably is 'all in', but it's a little hard to watch. If you like suspense, mystery, and drama with a very dark side this movie is for you."
4,Psychological Thriller,"Christian Bale is one of the greatest actors of his generation. That said, the Machinist is a unique psychological thriller in that the protagonist looks like Death warmed over. Bale is so bone-thin, it lends to the fear factor and the realism.The story is about Trevor Resnik, a loner machinist who works the graveyard shift. Strange events begin to occur, and Trevor believes there may be a conspiracy against him. As the viewer is drawn into his world, brief moments of happiness, respite from the fear, do not last long before we are plunged into another waking nightmare. We long for release for Trevor, and it is granted at the end, but not after a bit too long of a rollercoaster ride of mental adrenaline.Recommended, but I recommend the futuristic action film Equilibrium more. Bale is his best here, physically (thank God) and of course in acting ability."
5,The Machinist,"Brad Anderson is a genius. The movie was tight and everything came together. Amazing movie. If you liked Session 9 and Happy Accidents, this will take you to the moon and back. Looking forward to the DVD release, so I can watch it as many times as I like"
5,The best movie ever!!!!!!!,"I love this movie to death!!!!! My favorite type of movies are suspense movies and this one reigns supreme. I consider myself pretty smart,but this movie had me confused in the beginning. I had no clue, which is what makes this movie great!!! And Christian Bale....EXCELLENT!!! Now, everytime I watch it, I pick up more clues. It's a masterpiece and I highly recommended to anyone who like to challenge their brain!"
3,Intriging story,"Christian Bale is very impressive in this movie. He became so skinny for this movie that at some camera shots he barely seems to be alive. The Machinist offers you an intriging story about a factory worker who obviously should be able to be in a way better job than he is now. Throughout the movie the answer to this mystery is slowly revealed. Although the plot is satisfactory and the acting is fine, some pieces of the plot are not being explained well enough. However anyone who can still appreciate a movie that doesn't need lots of action to keep the viewers awake, will enjoy The Machinist. (SARR)"
3,very slow,"I was a machinist for 36 years. I could not get over the lack of safety glasses. everyone in that machine shop should be blind by now. no manufacturer will let you on the shop floor without steel toe boots and safety glasses. Now that that's out of my system, the movie is very slow and not much action. I will give Jenifer Jason Leigh a ten for the best tits in Hollywood."
2,Most depressing movie I've ever seen!,"Wow. I read the previous reviews and believed them. BIG mistake.This is the single most depressing movie I have ever seen. Not EXACTLY predictable; I mean, the guy doesn't appear to be schizophrenic, but wow. Just wow. Awful, awful, awful. No wonder it's free. The only reason I give it two stars is because the acting is superb. Please don't waste your time on this one. Life can be depressing enough without this totally unnecessary addition. BOOOOOOO!!!!"
2,an average movie...,"Christian Bale carries this movie through his will to play a role no actor would take based on the requirements. It is a questionable choice however because the movie itself lacks the depth of other dark films such as Taxi Driver and Max. Reznik, although played to perfection by Bale, is not an unforgetable character like Travis Bickle or Hitler. I had to give it a lower rating because people have hyped this movie to 4 stars out of 5, which it is not. It is an entertaining psychological thriller. The movie is very much about guilt and how it can tear someone up inside and make em crazy.Overall, it is a fun movie to watch, but do not expect the greatest psychological thriller ever."
4,"Good movie, but not the best.","This is a pretty good movie, but I've seen a lot better. It has a lot of traces though of other movies that have already been done before. And Christian Bale looks horrible in this movie. Its quite disgusting. I don't see why he had to get that skinny for this part. loosing weight i can see, but geez. He was barely even there. As for Christian Bale's acting. AWESOME. He should of been nominated for something for his role in this. Very good acting. Some times through the movie he was acting so well I almost forgot it was him.....Worth renting, but I'm not to sure about owning it unless you find it for cheap..."
4,Second best film I have seen this year! A sad little story.,"The crux of the film was a little disappointing to me at first, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized how sad the story actually was. Once you start to realize what is going on and why things are the way they are, you may be a bit let down, but underneath is a story of a man dealing with buried guilt for something I can't mention. At first it showed only on the outside, but then his mental state starts to break as we watch him battle his alter ego and which direction he should now take. Left or right? Finally, he gives in and takes the ""right path"" and maybe will get some sleep. Anyhow, this is a very well done and highly stylized film, I was not bored at any point in this movie. One thing it did not really need was the constant swearing, I mean who swears that much and why? It just gets old after awhile. Great film otherwise. Christian Bale may be one of greatest actors of all time!"
2,Not the best movie I've ever seen.,"I bought this movie for two reasons, Christian Bale is an amazing actor and the subject of insomnia strikes a chord in me because of my struggle with it personally. I have to admit my review is not nearly complete because I did not watch the entire movie. I just couldn't sit through any more of it. The movie failed to hold my attention despite my appreciation of Bale's usual incredible acting skills."
3,Been done before,"Ok this has been done before, maybe not with a hooker and a wretchedly skinny Christian Bale, but it's been done. The movie was still good though predictable."
4,Well done for what it is,"MACHINIST is one of those pure art films that the makers must have known would be seen by very few people when they were making it, but they made it out of love of the film media and acting for it's own sake.The movie is great at what it is, but not something you will probably add to your DVD collection or watch more than once.I don't know to be impressed with Bale for having the discipline to starve himself to such a degree -or- question his sanity as an actor who apparently gets totally immersed in his roles.His physical transformation must have been a personal challenge for himself since the budget on this film could not possibly have made it finanically tempting to starve himself to the point of looking like a Holocaust survivor."
4,"Very good, very creepy.","I can't exactly say that I *liked* this movie, but I absolutely could not have stopped watching it before the end. This film was about as compelling as a movie could be, in my opinion.The actors all do a fine job and the story is haunting. At first I thought it would be kind of funny, as the mother of a newborn, to watch a movie about a man who can't sleep, but Christian Bale puts a whole new spin on the concept of being tired."
3,Machinist Review,"I didn't realize the Bale ever got that skinny in real life. The embodiment of his inner-hate character was funny. Overall, the movie was interesting but somewhat underdeveloped."
5,The Machinist Review,This was an excellent movie. I think Christian Bale is a great actor who went above and beyond to make his character and the performance exceptional. I've seen it on cable many times but I still wanted to purchase the movie to have in my Library.
2,Better than counting sheep,"This movie--despite the hype you might hear to the contrary-is extremely boring-in fact I fell asleep watching it. A sluggish storyline does not equal suspense. I'll give Christian Bale credit for achieving the look of an anorexic released from a holiday in a concentration camp-it musn't have been an easy task--sort of a reverse ""Super Size Me""Later, after waking I finished the second half of this movie--the result was lackluster.As a sidenote--a friend recommended this movie to me--I owe him!Not much more to say--if you're having trouble getting a good nights sleep--this movie may be the cure for what ails you!"
3,The Machinist has some interesting parts to the movie,I seen the Machinist and first I couldnt believe how skinny the actor was so thin. ( I mean no meat on his skin.) This guy was skinny. The actor who portrays him also was in the great movie American Psycho. Well this movie is clearly about the spiritual supernatural I thought it was a good movie. It was a little errie with how the fun house scene was when the Fun house was called 666. The movie is about how he fights his demons of killing a little boy when he runs him over. Also when he gets a coworkers arm cut off by a machine and he is not able to stop the machine from cutting the mans arm off.Do your self a favor go and see this instead of that White Noise this is better.
3,Nightmarish,"A completely convincing, complex but unsubtle portrayal of the torturous psychological disintegration of an insomniac.dr_sasp"
4,horrifically good acting,"an ominous and deeply stirring account of a man on the extreme edge of existence. The movie deals powerfully with horrifying themes of guilt and existential dread - as well as fear, loneliness and paranoia.Many years ago I read the monumental work, The Brothers Karamazov, by Dostoyevsky. Until now, I had never seen a modern movie that so eerily captures the deep, dark torment of the human soul.This is a wonderfully acted film that will challenge you, and frighten you, and ultimately leave you profoundly affected by the experience."
4,A GREAT FILM,"I picked up this film because I was a huge fan of Bales work in American Psycho. I'll have to start by saying that this film is not for everyone. The overall feel of the movie is very dark and creepy and it may be unapealing to some people. The acing is top notch, Bale owned this role and even lost 60 pounds to play the part. This film is a greatpsychological thriller that will keep you wanting more throughout the entire movie."
4,Even has a taste of Hitchcock in it,"The music cues, some of the camera work, camera shots, etc are very reminiscent of Hitchcock's work, and that lends a lot to this film.This film combines a lot of things I liked in other films, like ""Fight Club"", ""Jacob's Ladder"", assorted Hitchcock films, etc.We all have seen and heard of actors gaining or losing spectacular amounts of weight for a film role, but JEEZY PEEZY!! Bale outdoes them all with this one."
4,"Eerie, creepy, solid film","I watched this with some trepidation. I'd seen previews before that seemed quite interesting, but I was sort of wondering why I'd not heard of this when it came out. It looked creepy, but in a good way. But on the other hand previews can be deceiving, especially when they get all the good stuff into that sixty seconds. But this is stellar.Scene by scene, minute by minute this is engaging, eerie, troubling filmmaking. You're never sure what's going to happen next, and for me, at least, I was kept on the edge the whole time.I worried that the ending wouldn't be satisfying, or that it would just descend into cheap horror. It doesn't, though. The ending is solid. It makes sense out of most of what came before and wraps it all up in a way that's ultimately revealing, reasonable and almost uplifting. Christian Bale is a tremendous actor. And the weight loss... It is incredible that he could/would do that."
4,NIGHTMARISH! WORTH WATCHING FOR BALE'S PERFORMANCE ALONE!,"This is one of the strangest and disturbing movies I've seen in a while. Christian Bale loses so much weight in this movie that it's hard to look at him. Filled with some really cool nightmarish visuals, this well written story may not be for everyone, but if you like weird movies..... Give it a try! Another great performance by Bale!"
4,Dark but a good story,"An interesting story about what it must be like to have dementia, paranoia, and insomnia at the same time. This is a fairly dark movie but in the end is an engaging story with an ending that brings everything together."
5,Don't read the spoiler reviews! Watch this excellent movie.,"Another creepy psychological thriller. It will keep you guessing (although I see some reviewers say they had it figured out all along --we're very prouda ya!) The twists and unexpected turns made this one very edgy!I read the reviews with low ratings and it seems they all come from people who express trouble following the plot line. That confusion is there for a reason. If you like movies that do not compel you to think and wonder, it will not work for you. If you like Rod Serling (I saw a few Serling fans in here) then you will be pleased. It has nothing to do with Fight Club or the Number 23, so don't be misled by folks who have a hard time with One of These Things is Not Like the Other. LOL!"
1,Gross,"Trevor Reznick (Christian Bale) hasn't slept in a year. But he's a machinist, which is a dangerous job for someone who's mind is going. So what portion of the story is his nightmare, hallucination or whatever, what part is memory, and what really happened the way it is presented to the audience? An interesting question if the truth is eventually figured out. All I can say is that this is the poor man's ""Number 23."" We never do find out exactly what is real and what isn't, even when Trevor finally says to Ivan, who has been haunting him, ""I know who you are."" He doesn't tell the audience!!!The other thing I hated was that Trevor was so skinny he looked like he was just released from Auschwitz. Various people ask if he's OK, but he says he is. Clearly he is not."
2,A Good Idea Executed Poorly,"The film fails to create a bond between the viewer and Bale's character until the very end, when it's too late to enjoy. Perhaps watching it for a 2nd time might be better, but it would hard to watch it again because of the stupid insertion of the role of IVAN, a character poorly drawn and awkwardly portrayed in the film. And then there's the ridiculous scene when Bale, after having been crushed by a car, runs away from the police. Simply absurd. But when we know what Bale has done to bring on inscrutable insomnia, much of the film comes together a bit better."
1,I don't understand these great reviews,"This movie is absolutely dreadful. My wife and I wanted to turn it off after 15 minutes, but I hung in there because of the stellar reviews on Amazon.The plot doesn't seem to go anywhere. This movie is a mystery with really bad awful clues to advance the story. The ""twist"" is such a let-down. I actually said, ""Really?"" when it was over.Wow, so Christian Bale was grotesquely skinny. Big deal. Not worth buying just for that... we've seen him do this a few times, and word is that he's getting freakishly thin YET again for another movie, Concrete Island. Maybe that one will be better."
2,Bale lost weight. So what?!,"Bale must have lost his mind! (no, not completely: he signed for Batman, and that is a very CLEVER movement...). He lost so much wight for a movie that did not deserve it. Useless piece of filmmaking..."
2,Just Awful!,"Right upfront, let me tell you that I didn't enjoy watching this movie one bit. We've all seen it. It used to be shocking and smart, but now it's been done so much that it's dumb and predictable. Let's have a whole lot of random odd things happen and in the end it will turn out the guys nuts. It's just not a twist any more. You can now see it coming and you now say, ""What, not this again."" If this picture has any meaning to it or is trying to make a point about something, I sure didn't get it. The movie doesn't let you know what is happening until the last few minutes of the film, so it requires that you sit through almost an hour and a half wondering what is going on.The dark gloomy atmosphere, together with the dark gloomy characters in the film help make it even more unpleasant. We know something is going on, but there is no hint of it until the movie is over."
1,Muddled Jumble of a Film,The cinematography was great but unfortunately that alone a worthy movie does not make. I was hoping perhaps the ending might make up for the terrible film but I was badly dissatisfied. I understand some people may view this film as some sort of high art but as for I it did not connect.
1,The Machinist,"I know Christian Bale is a good actor but this movie ""The Machinist"" looks bad and lame movie. I give one thumb up but this movie sucks!!!"
2,A little long-winded and boring,"Despite a stellar performance from Christian Bale (who looks like a concentration-camp victim), this movie tends to drag along and is definitely too long. Very depressing also.I would skip this one"
4,---You can't hide from yourself---,"In the Machinist, Christian Bale gives a terrific performance as a man with insomnia and severe delusions. This is a dark and rather disturbing film and not for everyone!To perfect his role, Bale lost over 60 pounds and that itself is depressing. He is such a wonderful actor; however, I feel compelled to say that no movie is worth an actor's health. Perhaps losing 20 pounds, wearing lose clothing and heavy makeup would have been sufficient for Bale's role in this film. I hope to see this young man around for years and many more films!"
3,Somewhat derivative but captivating,"If you liked Lost Highway, Identity and/or Fight Club, you'll like the Machinist. This movie also involves a central protagonist who is having some trouble getting a grip on his own sense of reality and individuality, while losing sleep and weight. Christian Bale's reverse Robert DeNiro Raging Bull performance really adds to the grimness and isolation of his character. Eventually, Christian Bale's Trevor realizes that his guilt needs to be dealt with properly and he reassimilates his fractured reality in order to escape his insomniac and anorectic existence."
3,Easiest the least surprising twist-plot...,"...since ""Secret window"" (Johnny Depp) though I have to say the story here was far more ""watertight"". It is intense to some level, you suffer with the main character in ""The machinist"" the way his life is being ""plagued"" by insomnia, and he looks like a skeleton -really. The problem is or was that I wasn't quite sure what kind of movie I was watching. The soundtrack is misfit; It has the music of a horror movie, and it is never scary, not even close. It is unpleasant, shaded and sad. This mans' life looks like a nightmare, Christian Bales' performance is indeed impressive (and not only because his great loss of weight for this part). However; The outcome was rather predictable, and I soon suspected where it was going, and I was close.So all in all -more drama than thriller. The movie makes you ""feel"" because of an sympathetic main character and great actor for the part. But nothing amazing, nothing remembarable. Ok movie."
4,"Came fast,",Bought because the price for a single pair was pretty high. They came fast are were satisfactory: The posts are metal and the wing nuts seem to be pressed from a sheet. The heads are plastic and can break if over-tightened or turned when jammed.I ditched the springs and wing-nuts and threw some lock-nuts on to make it a bit harder to steal my plate.
1,I would give 0 stars if possible,"I guarantee you will regret buying this camera if you do so. I have had the camera since it first came out (about a year ago). There are much fewer color options than other cameras produced at the same time and earlier than the F450. In fact, you basically have your choice of color or black & white. Although the pictures look normal once you upload them to your computer, on the LCD display they will look like a reddish haze. That's if you use the flash. Pictures are impossible to take without flash. They will be unusably blurry. Which means you will end up with red eye even when you're in a brightly lit place where you wouldn't normally need to use the flash. Less than a month after I bought it, the camera began ""sticking"". I turn it off and the zoom doesn't retract. So I have to turn it on and off again to be able to safely put it away.This camera was a huge mistake - Fujifilm's for making and selling it, and mine for buying it."
2,Incomplete Package,Product was missing two items (picture cradle and hand strap). A replacement was sent and the same two items were missing. Had to return both products because of the missing items.
5,Floods,I received this movie in a fast and timely manner. Product was exactly as described and arrived in perfect condition. Would recommend this seller to everyone.
4,A very nice monograph on Goya.,"Janis Tomlinson, the writer of this book, seems primarily concerned in showing that there is a continuity in Goya's work, that it did not suddenly change from light-hearted to dark after Goya went deaf. For the most part, I feel she achieved this end, I for one am convinced. I wish she wrote more on Goya's technique and his personal life, both of which she does not go into much. The 300 or so colour reproductions of Goya's work are excellent, and there are many good close-ups. Unfortunately, Goya produced around 1,800 works, so it is disappointing that only a fraction of them are in this book."
1,Why isn't this book published in large print?,"My mother would very much like to read this book and others like it, but she has age-related macular degeneration and can only read large print books. Why are these books, of all books, not printed in large print?"
4,This is a wonderful book but why is it not on audio tape?,Dr. Mogk's book is very helpful in understanding macular degeneration. She is one of the few people who seem to understand the problems we have. I am looking forward to beginning the exercises she recommends. I do wish someone would issue it on audio tapes.
4,Well imformed & I also found See Again by Dr. Eaton useful,"I found this book helpful, and informative. I also enjoyed See Again, another book on Macular Degeneration, which contains more information on sunglasses, sun protection, and ways to prevent macular degeneratation through diet."
5,"If there was such thing as an MD Bible, this would be it!","If all of us MD People were to get together and write a book, and we put everything in it that a newly-diagnosed person needed, this would be the result. We are grateful to these two authors for their expertise and diligence in putting it together, and I am recommending it to virtually EVERYONE who visits our web site!"
5,My favorite hand lotion,"I love this lotion. I have tried lots and lots of lotions and I have decided that this is the best hand lotion for me (most other lotions leave me with dry hands after 45 minutes or so) This lotion does not feel greasy, it keeps my hands moisturized for much longer periods of time than the others, it does not have any smells, and I like the way my hands feels after application. I wash my hands or get them wet doing dishes, house chores, etc., about once an hour or two."
2,Didn't notice any difference.,"I suffer from ichsthyosis and I was hoping this would be the end-all for my condition. Nope. This product is no better than an over the counter lotion (like curel, etc). It costs a lot (with shipping) and it smells bad."
3,don't expect rudy,for what it was it was just ok for me. the main issue i have is the viewer doesn't invest himself or herself emotionally in this movie. It literally could have ended at any point and i would have walked away feeling about the same as i did. good perfomance by mark wahlberg but it doesn't have that certain ingredient to make it special like rudy and rocky and mighty ducks had
3,fumble,"mark wahlberg has a world of potential, so why he selected this project is a mystery to me. this story is long, slow and boring. it makes you feel like you spent the entire film in a bar with a bunch of losers. i had the feeling that the makers of this film wanted to emulate cinderella man, which is a classic. i'm usually not terribly critical but in this case i will suggest you don't waste your money and more importantly your time."

3,democratic movie,Only a true masochist or someone with a low pain thresholdwould take up the NFL at 30?That he was successful is simply amazing.My own point of view is he should have moved to Seattleand got a job teaching there.This is a good biographical football movie.I really think that we should have a movie about someone like Benoit Mandelbrotbefore a football player:the result tends to give people a false world picture?
4,Invincible worth the time,"OK, being an Eagles fan I knew I was going to like this, but it did live up to all my expectations.If you liked Rudy, then this is for you"
4,Better than you think,A true story and a movie my wife and I enjoyed.. yes you can watch it more then once. I think you would would enjoy this.
4,Great football movie!!!,This was a fun movie. I'm a big football fan and loved the underdog story. Also based on a true story. Blu-ray picture quality is excellent.
3,Pretty good story - terrible cinematography,Story is enteraining. A major distraction from the story is a grossly exaggerated yellow tint to most scenes. These are occasionally by scenes with an excessive blue balance. Maybe the cinematographer thought these would balance out. It doesn't work It's just distracting. The other major flaw is the casting of Greg Kinnear as a football coach. Are they kidding? Totally inappropriate and unbelievable. Neither the cinematographer nor the casting director nor the Disney executive who hired them should ever work in film again.
3,Wahlberg does Sly Stone,"Another real life story from he ""city of brotherly love"". I kept waiting to see Wahlberg punching a dead cow or yell Adrian from the field. This story is a been there, done that tired old tale. SAve yourslef the 90 inutes and watch something else."
2,Sentimental and Obvious Feel Good Junk,I just got done watching Invincible with Mark Wahlberg. Several people I know went to see this movie and told me how good it was. I went in to it with an open mind and thinking it was going to be really good. I must say that this movie was just your cookie cutter feel good sports movie. It was so predictable that it wasn't even funny. And the 'I love you man' moments were just nauseating.
1,Disappointed,I expected him to be a better football player... I cannot understand how he became a professional athlete - he doesn't cut it in my eyes and my husband felt the same way - he was just an average player at best and we were bored
4,Football movies can't lose,"Wahlberg is a likable actor even when he plays a dink, which he doesn't here. The NFL was peaking during this era even though my Packers were lousy at the time. The league has gone down hill ever since. This movie captured the feel. Very authentic. Very entertaining. But then, even a bad sports movie beats the hell out of any Julia Roberts flick."
5,Invincible,A beautiful story about determination and success against all odds. I've shown this film to addicts and alcoholics seeking recovery and the reaction was totally positive.
4,Might Be My Favorite Sports Movie,"I really, really like this movie. Mark Wahlberg did a great job, in my opinion. Knowing that this film is based off the life of an actual person makes it a much more emotional journey, and I found myself really rooting for him to succeed. The end of the movie is really inspirational, and I teared up a little when I first saw it. Great movie."
4,Feel good movie,A good feel good sports movie. This movie shows a guy at his lowest and how he turned his life around in the most unlikeliest way.
3,Game on Vince,"Invincible is a great story that proves that even us normal people can achieve great things. It emphasizes, untrue sports movie style, the importance of character and heart on the sports' field. Vince is a likable guy, and so this feel good movie will always have a place in my video library."
4,Very good,"Others have gone into detail in plot, and as this is a straightforward film, there's no need to do so again. I will say this, though. If Vince's wife really did write him that note (""You're no good...""), boy is she chewing on wood right now. Then again, it was a Disney film, so we should accept that certain things are dramatized.Some might complain that this is simplistic, but I would argue that it depicted real blue collar relationships, and actually had quite a bit to say about them.In the end, though, it is a Disney movie, and there are Disney moments. If you're man enough to stand it, you might find yourself choked up a bit."
4,Love Those True Stories,"Yet another sports movie, however, this one was surprisingly well done, good acting and sensitive. Mark Wahlberg did an excellent job. I would recommend this movie to all my friends -- it's a feel good about oneself movie!"
4,"In""Vince""ible","Vince Papale has nothing going for him. Times are tough in Philadelphia in the the mid-70's for the 30-year-old who has lost his wife and his part-time teaching job. He stills works parttime at a neighborhood bar where his friends encourage him to go to the open tryouts for the Philadelphia Eagles. New coach Dick Vermeil is trying to stir up interest in a team that has disappointed Eagles' fans for several years by opening up a tryout for anyone in the area. Papale goes through a grueling training camp in which he is physically challenged and is totally shunned by the other players. This is a ""feel-good"" sports movie which is based on a true story, giving it viewer credibility. It is recommended viewing."
3,"a real Life Rocky,Pretty Good Film",the life story of Vince Papale where upon taking a chance at a Open try-out with the Philidelphia Eagles he makes the team. Coach Dick Vermil welcomes Papale on the team. Both Men where making there mark on the city of Brotherly Love back in 1976. Mark Wahlberg does a good job in this film. the local tavern Max's Tavern. Greg Kinnear does a good job portrayng Dick Vermil. you get a feel of Philly. alot of Hard work&odds are stacked against you. the Film has that disney vibe&the Rocky element is felt through out. it's a Pretty Good movie.
4,The REAL Philly Rocky!,"Being an extra in Invincible (about 3 seconds on screen!)...., and a person who lived the Vince Papale years with the Eagles, probably makes me less objective than others who saw this movie. That being said, it is still a great story, shot beautifully on the streets of South Philly, with an understated, yet powerful performance by Mark Whalberg as Vince. I got the opportunity to hang with the REAL Vince Papale during the shoot, and he was simply overwhelmed by the experience of a hollywood studio producing a story of a portion of his life. The DVD also has a nice 30 minute documentary of how it all came together as a film, and the soundtrack is great for those of us who grew up during that time period.Academy Award material? No, but a nice feel-good story with some great football action shots."
4,Invincible,"In order to turn around the hapless Philadelphia Eagles, new coach Dick Vermeil (Kinnear) decides to have open tryouts for the new season. Long time fan Vince Papale (Wahlberg) is pushed by his friends to try out, and ends up being the only walk on player to make the team. Vermeil stands by Papale as the rest of the team questions his decision.""Invincible"" is the latest in a long string of sports movies from Disney, and like its predecessors, it delivers exactly what you expect: the story of an underdog overcoming various obstacles to succeed. This is a true story, so there are no real surprises, but the desire to see Papale succeed keeps the movie going. In fact, the story outshines everything else about this movie. The acting is adequate, the directin is fine, but nothing outstanding. The story of Papale gives hope to anyone who has dreamed of playing professional football. ""Invincible"" is an entertaining movie that can be enjoyed by all."
4,A feel good movie,"This movie was well done, it builds the problem (a depressed era) and a lack of confidence and shows how one man handles that struggle with the help of his friends and family. A must watch and one that I would recommend purchasing. Then do a look up on Wikpedia to learn more about the man."
5,A MUST FOR EAGLE FANS & FOOTBALL FANS....,I'm a native Baltimorean but you can feel the spirit of Philadelphia in this movie.The acting is great and it flows really nice with the 70's music.To top it all off the Bonus features has the real Vince Papali and Dick Vermeil talking about the actual events...there's also archival footage that even shows the open tryouts in 1975-awesome & hilarious footage!If you are an EAGLE fan this is MUST OWN MATERIAL.This movie tops Rudy!
3,Philly Born & Raised ~ In Some Places Sport Is Life,"`Invincible' released in '06 is another good sports movie to add to you evergrowing ""Tough Guy"" DVD collection. Mark Wahlberg is quite likeable as true life professional football player Vince Papale, Greg Kinnear delivers another strong performance as Philadelphia Eagles head coach Dick Vermeil and Elizabeth Banks is lovely and believable as Mark's love interest Janet.An inspiring storyline, a little romance and a great soundtrack mean an enjoyable evening of family entertainment awaits. It's definitely not in the class of `Rudy' or `Rocky' but then what is?"
5,Better condition than advertised! A blast from my past!,"This ""good condition"" songbook is so nearly new that the pages still don't turn freely in the wire binding! There was a finger smudge on one page--about the only thing I could find. I'm grateful--this is the book my kids and I used, lo those many years ago!"
5,Glowing,"Fizzle Mountain Books provided #1)the product exactly as they stated in the condition they stated it would be and #2)""above and beyond"" customer service. It's a longish story that I won't go into right not, but if you want details please contact me.Most Sincerely,Jackie in Toronto"
5,Spiral Format,One of my favorite of the Readers Digest collection. I wish they would publish more of this type. I especially like the convenience of the spiral binding.
3,A Little Balance and Perspective please - . . . ALL THE RAGE is Much Better,"So even though RAGE is currently rated lower, that's the one to get. It's a classic 80's party album that's also much more than just a party album. HAND TO MOUTH is more for committed fans. I do especially like ""In Conversation"" and ""Come Again!"" is a plea for Jesus Christ's return as well as a very fun, upbeat song. I no longer subscribe to Christianity, but I can still appreciate the tune."
4,Capaldi on Mill,"From the view of philosophy departments, Mill is frequently read as as figure in the line of traditional empiricists stretching from Locke to Russell. In that context, some of his teachings, such as the quality of pleasure and the primacy of social good seem like, well, mistakes. In fact, that's how it was presented to me in school and I'm afraid I may have passed that view on. I always wondered how a guy so smart could be so dumb. By bringing in the French connection (and Mill's intellectual environment in general), Capaldi presents the complete thinker. That's a service. Of course, given their format, no title in this series from Cambridge can be either a full scale biography or a full scale commentary."
4,Solid; good biography of a Victorian Princess,"It doesn't spill secrets (it was written in 1957 after all), but it's interesting, informative, and well-written. Beatrice was a good Princess and a good daughter, wife & mother (in that order, actually), and an intelligent woman who was molded by her straightlaced upbringing as the youngest child of her mother, Queen Victoria. There is a particularly interesting appendix regarding Prince Alexander of Battenberg, his reign as Prince of Bulgaria, and the Princess Victoria of Prussia, which has information that I'd never seen in any other book. Recommended."
5,Best neck strap out there for small digitals,"After trying many, this is the best neck stap for compact digital cameras in my opinion. Hard to find, but worth it."
5,Good Conclusion,It was a little predictable in parts but overall it was a really good conclusion to the story. I'm glad that in the end they didn't let their own ideals of right and wrong be changed or compromised. I just randomly picked up the first book in a local used book store cause it sounded kind of interesting and I'm really glad I did. Very different from the books I tend to normally read but still just about as good.
2,Stunningly simplistic,I did not find this book even mildly interesting. The characters were simplistic and Maura was almost infantile. Tired plot with clumsily handled dialog. Unbelievably boring.
5,Superb!,"Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth Century Odyssey is a wonderful read. It is packed with new material about Madeleine Albright and insights into her life, beginning with a painfully vivid reconstruction of the deaths of many of her family members in the Holocaust. It shows how Albright has drawn on the drive and resourcefulness of her ancestors in Central Europe to make it to the top in America. The Blackman book, to which the previous reviewer refers, pales by comparison.Dobbs has interviewed many more people than his competitor, and his research is much more thorough. If you only have time for one Albright book, make it this one!"
5,Exceptional and fascinating- a great reading group book!,"What a fabulous book! I couldn't put it down. Having read this book, I have a new appreciation for Madeleine Albright as a woman who raised her children and then started a career which took her to the top. Dobbs is deeply sensitive to this, and you get the feeling that even as she climbs the ladder to her ultimate success, she wonders whether she is up to the job that lies ahead. Don't we women all have this experience at one time or another, even as we stop what we are doing to raise our children? Dobbs seems to have presented Albright with the only family tree she has even seen. He found branches of her family she never knew existed. The tragedy which befell her family in the Holocaust is not in vain - at the end of a century which molded and shaped her family, she has found them all again. A riveting story and it's beautifully written - I highly recommend this book."
1,Ho hum,"Dobbs deserves credit for breaking the story of Albright's Jewish roots. but this book is little more than a collection of previously published stories that draws no new conclusions. I read another Albright biography, Seasons of Her Life, that was better written and contained lots of fresh material about this fascinating woman. I would recommend it over this Dobbs book without hesitation."
2,Torn apart like UT's defense on a run play,"The size says fits all, but it would not go on my 1999 Ford F150 steering wheel. While trying to put it on it split at the seam. I had to use duct tape to secure it on my steering wheel. Don't try this on Trucks is the best advice I can give."
2,bad services,"I ordered the faucet on Dec. 28 and was not able to receive the product until Jan. 17.The faucet came without the bottom plate, and the instructions does not mention the bottom plate either. I installed the faucet several times to stop the leaking, but failed. I called the customer service on Jan. 19, they order a bottom plate for me.The bottom plate came on Jan. 26, but obviousely the size and the shape were all wrong. I called the customer service again on Jan. 27, and was promised the second correct order.I am still waiting and sink is still leaking. I called today and found there was no second order. I will have to wait for at least another week for the bottom plate and hoep this time it will be a correct one.By the way, it is not easy to get through the phone line. It is not unusual to wait for over 5 mimutes."
4,A potent brew...,"I hadn't heard this for years, but recently picked it up again... I used to love the title track, Shepp soloing forcefully around a driving Afrocentric percussive line (featuring the late Ed Blackwell on rhythm logs) for some fifteen minutes, while having mixed feelings about the rest of the album, which seemed tighter and ""jazzier"" and less inspired. With time, my feelings have flip-flopped, and I think the fifteen minutes of soloing gets a bit MUCH, while being drawn to the tighter, jazzier numbers. Go figure. Anyhow, it's a fine album, not quite the masterpiece that is FIRE MUSIC, but pretty strong stuff, and worth having around. ""Sorry 'bout that,"" the last cut, is fun, lively, and impassioned, in particular. The only other names I recognize in the lineup are Beaver Harris and Reggie Workman -- Rudd and Moncur aren't present, nor is Marion Brown... I can't say much about this disc beyond that, find words failing me, but think it's worth your time (and the cost of the import)."
2,Below Shepp's abilities,"I love Archie Shepp--look at my reviews-but this, along with Three for a quater and one for a dime-just does not do it for meThe first track is simply Shepp blowing with bass and drums, with a little Aftican percussion. The other three tracks are more staight jazz tunes that evolve into the same idea.Free Jazz can be amazing when well planned, but here, there is no backdrop or counterpoint draw you in. There is a reason Coltrane always had Tyner comping behind him; free playing has to work against other instruments for it to be interesting. Otherwise, `you are boxing with air (which, by the way, i did in my drinking days, and this is not too productive, either)This is not the worst album in the world, but listen to Fire Music and then tell me this is up to Shepp's brillance. I don't beleive that.Amazing cover, though. If you are going to buy this, try and get the 1967 ABC Vinyl."
2,Simple and out-dated,"While a bulk of the book is filled with helpful (if not common sense) tips on planning an event... the truly important section, the resources section, is horribly out of date.Many of the publication, speaking society, portal, and technology company links are not functional.I've never tried to plan an event without having resources. If you don't want to be in that situation either, I'd suggest skipping this book."
3,Good info,This is an excellent source for the beginner planner. It breaks down what is need and what to do.
4,By the end I really liked it,"I had mixed feelings about this book, but by the end I really liked it. It was a very interesting exploration of memory, loss, impermanence, and the fragmentary nature of life. It was a very atmospheric book, evocative and descriptive, not a driven by twists and turns of plot or dialogue, but it is thought provoking, and multi-layered. I am surprised by how long it has stayed with me, and how many times I find myself thinking about it and recommending it to others..."
4,Practical Guide in Developmental Disabilities,"This is the most comprehensive guide I have found in the field of developmental disabilities. This book should be a must for service providers to use in training support staff. Parents will find it useful as well, especially those with adult children with disabilties."
4,Quilting the Lodge Look,I really enjoyed this interesting and fasinating book with it's lodge look designs. I would tell others of this book to get ideas.
5,What can I say?,"Just plain good. Nothing more to say about it. These are flexible, easy to install and remove and look great."
5,Great cable,Works as expected. Great snagless ends! This is a pliable cable that doesn't fight you on staying where it's put. No speed issues and no complaints here.
5,Check the seller when you change lengths or colors,"These are excellent cables at a good price.Some reviewers have mentioned receiving knock-offs. Be careful when you change lengths or colors, because the seller may change. I was careful to only buy lengths and colors sold by Amazon, and got genuine Cables To Go parts."
4,Good Edgy Metaphor,"Likening sex to building and managing a business makes you think of the basics we all want in life, recognition, respect, and feeling human. Good fundamentals in a quick read, a great reminder of what we should be doing to each other if we are truly in touch with ourselves."
1,DON'T LET KIDS LOOK AT THIS BOOK UNSUPERVISED!!!,"They will become atheists. In the book they try to debunk evolution by showing its absurdity with an illustration of how cow turns into a whale by swimming a lot. DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS SEE THIS CARTOON. To their tiny brains it makes total sense. I know, because it happened to me *sob*. Heed my warning for the love of God DON'T LET THEM SEE THE COW!!!!!!!!!"
4,Scientists' theories of dinos often found incorrect; this creationist view offers logic,"If you want an explanation of dinos based on the creationist view of science, this is a good book. Dramatic pictures and accurate info about what the dinosaurs were really like. Because more and more scientific theories are being proven wrong, this is a good book to help explain the truth. Only flaw is that for younger kids seeking truth, this book can be wordy."
3,worthless debate?,"I have not read this book, and i don't intend to, but i have seen a webpage that is like it. does anyone seriously think one side will listen to the other enough to write a whole book on it? my god. anyway, i give it a 5 because that's in the middle. I also seriously doubt that it's a ""children's book&quot"
3,"Tarnished, but still golden....","You should be nice to old dying Apaches you find in the desert, they may draw a map in the sand for your kindness, a map to the Lost Adams Diggings, where the gold nuggets are the size of crickets, and they're just laying around on the ground, waiting for a prospector to fill his saddlebags. The dialogue in this book is positively silly. Pelon, the brutish half-Mexican, half-Apache, one hundred percent outlaw bandit speaks as if he was educated at Oxford, and has a sense of honor not normally found in your average outlaw bandit/murderer. Mackenna knows the map to the gold, so Pelon can't kill him, at least not until the location of the gold is pointed out. Mackenna, of course, is busy trying not to fall in love with the beautiful young hostage, and avoiding the amorous intentions of Pelon's Apache sister. Western escapest literature from the early sixties."
2,"liked the movie, so I read the book","While never a cimena classic, the 1969 film adaptation has always been one of my favorite ""nothing special"" movies, so that was enough for me to read the Will Henry novel when a used copy passed through my hands.The novel is radically different from the film, the novel is much slower and less exciting, but still good-enough escapist Western fiction on it's own terms. The previous reviewers have done a good job detailing the differences, so I have nothing to add there.If you are a fan of western fiction, you'll not be bored,and Henry is an established name in the genre. If you've seen the movie, check out the novel and see how different it is from the film adaptation."
2,The spoon has a contaminating odor when hot,The spoon exudes a strong chemical odor when when heated up by the food. I'm reluctant to use it anymore.
2,Grove could hold bacteria,"I like 3 Calphalon Nylon spatulas/turners (purchased in the last two years at various places); each piece is seamless single material construction with the brand name stamped on a small silver rectangle printed on the black handle. This Calphalon Nylon Spoon line is NOT a newer model of the seamless, clean construction. My fingernail can easily slip into the open grove around the gray insert on the handle of the spoon. I believe soup, sauces, oils, batters, flour,etc. would be difficult to clean out of the thin grove. I sent this spoon back."
2,Appear to be used,"They appear to be used. I do not want to spend money on shipping them back. They were not wrapped in plastic bag or something and they had a layer of black powder (generated due to friction with brake drum), indicating that they have been used before."
2,Not the best cookbook,"As someone who is new to the candida world the information provided was extremely useful. The recipes on the other hand left much to be desired. I am an avid cook and had to ammend the recipes I tried in order to make them somewhat palattable. Some like the baking, were unfixable and had to be discarded. Some of the combinations suggested are absolutely unthinkable. If you are looking for good background information on candida this is a great book. If you are looking for great recipes, try something else."
2,"Not much use, really","A lot of Christian tosh interspersed with some useful information about practical steps to take to get Candida under control. The recipes are useless for people following food-combining or gluten-free diets. Overall, I wish I never bought it."
3,Weak Sauce...,"Not sure what I was thinking when I bought this. At 256MB of onboard memory, this card is NOT for anyone wanting to play any advanced games. If your gaming preferences lie with Mah Jong or Solitaire, this card will work, but if you are looking to play graphically advanced games, keep looking and pay a bit more. I ended up getting a PNY GForce 9600GT to replace this one after only a month."
5,Who needs Sinatra ?,"This is one of Bert's top 5 albums without a doubt.The band delivers its classic mid-late 60's sound with some very impressive numbers.What beautiful trumpet solos - complemented by a terrific stereophonic brass section which sounds unreal with the Taragon remastered CDs.Ironically ""Strangers in the Night"" is not the great played number in here - it's actually a bit dull.There are several great numbers - PussyFootin is a beautiful number.You have to have this!"
3,Below expectations,"I couldn't believe it.. but it came without ANY kind of manual or assembly instructions! I had to print them out myself from the manufacturer's website.The packaging is very minimal, a few parts came with small scratches on them, I had to straighten out 2-3 metal parts that got a bent during shipping. The packaging box had a few small holes in it, bags that contained screws had holes too. It could have easily arrived with missing screws. The main cooking grids came with 3-4 nicks on their coating.The assembly manual is not user friendly and not very well thought out, towards the end especially.Took about 90 minutes to put it together, that's without counting the time spent by my wife trying to figure out the lame assembly instructions.Sometimes a tiny bit of BBQ grease manages to drip through vent openings on the bottom of the grill, openings which are not below the grease collection cup.The only reasons I gave it 3 stars is because it seems to work well as a LP gas BBQ."
2,Not good.,"I found that this book wasnt that great. Far too many of the photos are silhouettes or very shadowy and not in an artistic way. I bought this book at the same time I bought Beautiful: Nudes by Marc Baptiste and in comparison, it made this book look even worse. If you want a great book with photos of beautiful(artistic, not smutty) naked women, go with Beautiful: Nudes instead."
4,Pure black art,"The images presented here by Mr. Allen represent an insightful and imaginative celebration of the black female form. Mr. Allen Photos are clean, honest, unadorned and subtly sensuous. The endless variety of textures, tones and forms of the black female body are creatively presented through the eye of a true craftsman. In this offering it is the art.... not the nudity that is most compelling. I'm looking forward to more of Mr. Allen's work."
5,"Easy read, VERY helpful!","""Breathing Space"" is a wonderful concept and is laid out nicely by the author in this easy-to-read book. It's only about 210 pages but mercifully, most pages don't contain a lot of text. So it's easy on the eyes, and easy on the mind. I agree whole-heartedly with the author's premise that the pace of life has sped up because of what he calls ""macro-realities,"" a sort of mega-trends that are here now and continue to impact every element of our lives. Buy this book for yourself and for people you care about. It'll give you insights and perspectives that are unique and vital. More important, you'll have a broad-base understanding as to why we all seem to be in such a hurry all the time, and have a real good chance of getting past this trap."
5,Well Worth the Money,"* I would give this book an 11, if the scale went that high. From the opening gun, right through to the last words, I found this entire book to be easy to read and extremely helpful. The author doesn't preach, or get into technical gobbledygook. He stays on course, for the most part, addressing root causes of the situations that most of us face on a fairly regular basis, and then providing very doable suggestions to achieve desired results."
4,"""Among our most-swiped books!""","The selection in our living room bookshelf is, admittedly, ""eclectic."" And maybe it's that good salt air, or the thoughtful mode you slip into when you're on an island. But our guests just DIVE for this book. Jeff's onto something when he cautions against attempting ""time management."" He's right...it WON'T be managed. Yet Jeff's notion of SPACE management can make a difference. Even when you're not 12 miles out in the ocean."
5,Reward and Contribution,"First I want to put away any doubt concerning why this book is on the market and highly rated in a time when America is undergoing change due to the terrorism causing many books to receive unwarranted publicity. This is a genuine effort that I do believe will help many in many various ways. Parents and children will both reap reward and joyfully sow contribution from this diverse method labeled AP. The book does have some very fundamental teaching, however the art of being a good parent is revived in those common sense teachings. This is a book that gets us back to Grass Roots America which in truth is direly needed. A cumulative guide touching many subjects of upbringing. May have a little weakness in choosing between teaching God spirituality and human spirit. For that I recommend a very unbiased book that is for all ages which could help parents on that subject with their children, teaches contribution as well, SB 1 or God by Maddox."
2,Won't buy these again,"This was my second pair of earrings. The back became loose and I lost one of the earrings. I thought that I had done something wrong. I liked the size, price and they were white gold. So, I purchased another pair. After about 2 weeks of wearing the earrings. The back became loose and I lost another earring.My inexpensive earrings went from $25 to $50. I'm not buying another pair. I decided I'd save money buying a more expensive pair"
3,nice but same old stuff,"I was looking for seomthing new to listen to during massage, and I like classic music. What I realized when I listened to this and several more like it, is that it is all kind of boring. The reason I suppose is because there were only a limited number of composers in the last couple of centures, especially 17th through 19th centuries, so we've all heard it all before...Nevertheless, this is a nice CD, very pleasant versions of classic works."
4,Good surprise!,I never read from this author before and I usually don't like mystery type novels. But this was a very good book. Jammed packed with everything thing you need for a little entertainment plus a little social commentary mixed in.
3,Another Maintenance Man,"When I read the description of this book I could not wait to read it. Night Work is about a man name Night who wants to be a r&b singer by day but is a ""maintenance man"" to women by night. Sounds good right? Well, Night Work COULD have been a good novel if this same book was not done before a few years earlier by Michael Baisden. When I finally finished the book it left me feeling like ""Is this it""? The murder plot was not that exciting either. Maintenance Man was a much better book."
4,Parental Helper,This game was really good.But if all you parents are questioned on is this appropiate for my child?I'd say if they are young it's inappropiate.Because some characters might say the B word or the a word and the d word.Its gangsta violent and girls will fight over men.Rap music is always going on but the music they play is clean rap not explict lyrics rap.
1,i wish..........,i wish i could rate this game but you haven't sent me the game yet. it's really pissing me off that i paid for the game and it's not here yet. hurry up with my sh** or you give me my money back.
4,a player,This game is cool but they realy have to put create a player and a bigger story mode and put in some wepons.I am realy looking forword to the release of Def Jam 2 and hopefuly it will be better but still a realy fun game!!!!!!!!!!
3,"To ""Sweet Cheeks ""watty420""","I've never played this game but had to submit a rating to post a review. I'm not a big hip-hop fan but I do like fighting games. If you don't like hip-hop or this game then fine. But just because you don't like hip-hop doesn't mean it sucks. Everyone can have their opinion, but the way you expressed yours was (in my opinion) childish, rude, and offensive. I don't like ska music, but that doesn't mean that ska sucks.I take offense at the term ""wigger."" Where do you or anyone else who uses that term get off saying that?! Have you ever thought about where that word comes from?! Hello! Its root word is quite offensive and inappropriate and the variation ""wigger"" is an insult to both races it refers to.I suggest you grow up, learn how to express yourself and your opinions like a mature adult, and eliminate the offensive-racial terminology from your vocabulary or at least keep it to yourself...because the rest of don't wanna hear that crap!"
4,good game,"This game is pretty good. The only problem is it's kind of hard. If you had the strongest guy in the game, and were fighting the weakest girl, and tried to do a powerbomb, she'd reverse you every time. There's over 40 characters in the game. You have to unlock most of them in story mode. The story mode is good. Once you get a girlfriend, other girls will fight her over you."
4,its all right,its all right kinda easy though. i only had trouble with about 5 fights but after a couple more goes i beat them.
3,"A good game, but could be tweaked more","Def Jam Vendetta was a fresh idea from the developers, but since it's first generation, some mods are definitely in order. It's Wrestling, right??...Where's the Chairs, Bells e.t.c to smack your opponents with?? The game could also benefit from more artists. Where's LL Cool J, Beastie Boys and RUN DMC...and what the hell is Funk Master Flex doing there???!!!??? Anyway, the Grab and hold game engine is good, the ""BLAZIN"" finishers are a sight for sore eyes and will make you say WHOA, the tracks are hot, but like the fighters they need more classic tracks. My advice is, get this at a bargain basement when value goes down...it's not worth u'r $50 plus tax, Hell, AMAZON has is for 20 bucks!!"
3,"Fun, but doesn't last long.","Perhaps once it reaches the bargain bin, this game will be worth buying, but as it stands, the fun doesn't last long.The wrestling is great, the graphics are good, the sound is decent, but it's the lack of options and cusomiseability that brings this game down. There's no create-a-wrestler option, so once you've beaten the game (not a terribly difficult thing to do) you're left with nothing."
4,I am very pleased with this game,Hi my name is lashawn and I really like this game it is exciting and enjoyable I never thought I would say this but this game is much better then all the wwe and wwf games and they should make a def jam vedetta part 2
4,After All These Years This Game Is Still Hella Fun,This has to be the most fun game out of the francise surely based on its replay value alone. the roster of mcs in this game allows you to have fantasy matchs pitting MC VS MC
4,Def jam vendetta,The game is fun an works perfectly fine.Good deal an fast shipping an accurate.i would recommend this to anyone but def jam fight for ny is way better
1,Total Garbage,"I wonder who was the genius who came up with the idea of glorifying and incorporating hip-hop style violence into a video game whose target audience is made up of teenagers? This game also shows that it is fun to beat up on women. There's already enough gang violence in our nation's inner cities, we don't need little suburbanites to follow in the example of violent criminals."
1,Great. A rap-style wrestling game.,"More glorification of hip-hop culture and violence towards women. I can see why this title is so popular, specifically in the USA. In this era of garbage like gangsta rap, the jerry springer show, MTV's ""Jackass"" and ""Girls Gone Wild"" videos, this game fits perfectly, and will entertain countless numbers of mind-numbed idiots for years to come."
4,Good Wrestling Action,"This game is one of the best wrestling games availible. It features famous rappers such as Ludacris and DMX. Its pretty easy to pick up the controls and delivers a good dose of action. The only complaints are the lack of modes, out of ring weapons, & Create-A-Wrestler. It's a great game for what it does have but it could have had more stuff. Maybe next year. Still reccomended."
4,"I'm a Ghost, I can't be broke......","Having not played any of the other wrestling games mentioned, I really have none to compare this one to. But it's a definite keeper, if only to hear the comments made by the video game rappers real life counter parts and fight in their own unique environments. Gameplay is tricky on PS2 because only one button controls your kicks/punches. But once you get the hang of it it's pretty fun to watch what happens. Plus they have an added feature that lets you exchange girlfriends if you see one that looks better. You'll have to play to understand. When first learning moves, Ghostface Killah is the best character to use.He's strong and really agile. Overall a decent way to blow [money amount]on a game...."

4,good game.....forget sweet cheeks,"great game for playing with a group of friends, as said before if you play alone it may be hard, however I was able to beat everyone myself on easy..... not sure why others are having problems with that.and to all that read ""sweet cheeks watty420"" review, please take a look at his reveiw on beef...... it is below, sure sounds like he is one of those &*(*&ers;, I won't spell it beacuse it is demeaning to me and to all races, so look at his review of this game to see the word he usedMan, I Sure Love Beef, October 16, 2004Reviewer: Sweet Cheeks ""watty420"" (The Seas O' Cheese) - See all my reviewsBeef is such a great movie. I love Beef. Beef touched me. Beef is the Apocalypse Now of my generation. Beef is friggin great. Again, I love Beef."
3,LIMITED PLAY,"This game could have been so much more but I beat it in the first three days and unlocked every possible secret that the game had thus, the game is limited to a player's freedom in which you could only do so many things for only such an amount of time. EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME IS LIMITED and I now sold it to my friend for a half quarter! This game would have been better if it had the following:CREATE A WRESTLER MODECHAMPIONSHIP TITLES OR BELTSOPTION ON CHANGING RULESThen this game would be great but I guess we will have to wait for the sequal for these certain things to come. Anyways I really love the fact that the one and only company with the best controls for any wrestling game ever (AKI) made this game and that is a big positive but the only one I can think of. It's definitely a rent in my opinion and only good playing with some friends or family."
3,Sweet Game!,"I though this game was pretty fun, I mean it wasn't the best. I've played better so i dont reccomend it. I enjoyed playin it, it just hasn;t been a perfect game, but actually i've never met the perfect game on any playing system!"
5,My own life is behind these recordings,"I can assure that one of the reason I love music is due to these recordings of Mr. Stokowsky. My father had the record of Scherezade and, though my father was an ignorant about cultivated music, he knew very well what to appreciate. We never argued when I played Beethoven's first symphony so loud, however, he always did when I played Rolling Stones so loud. I adore that he taught me to appreciate Rimsky-korsakov's music as well as Tchaikovsky's Capriccio Spagnolo so young. He was wise, on his way. I can't help to cry for him, listening to Borodin's Palatsovian dances, because, it is great music, and, having into account that I used to love it by Mr. Stokowsky's work, it doubles my crying and my remembrance. He loved the record so much. I love you, daddy."
1,"New ""animation"" ruins the atmosphere-hard for autistic kids","My son has loved Thomas since he was 2. He has mild autism. Kids love Thomas-not just for the characters-but because it is predictable in setting and style. Yet new stories make it fresh each time. The new animation makes their mouths move like Jay Jay the Jet Plane-not like Shrek. The original Thomas stories were grounded in music and a great narrator's voice telling the story. It is too bad they have once again ""fixed"" something that was not broken. I wish they would stop trying to take things over the top. Our kids don't need it. I agree with the other reviewer who gave it one star. My son got very upset and demanded that we turn it off. He now suspects every Thomas DVD I bring home and we have to make sure its the ""old"" Thomas. Too bad they sold Thomas to a bigger company. It will never be the same again."
1,Thomas The Computer Generated Tank Engine,"My sixteen month old son loves Thomas & Friends. This new ""improved"" version is fully computer generated. As soon as he saw their mouths moving he FREAKED OUT and cried until I turned the DVD off. I don't recommend buying these newer DVD's for smaller children. It may be cool for older kids but it's frightening for youngsters who are used to the classic Thomas series. It's a shame they had to ruin it."
4,"Three girls, three viewpoints","One is abt to join a man in an arranged marriage and expects a fairy tale life. One is a repressed lesbian trying to come to terms with urges that her culture demonizes. The third is struggling to overcome the incestuous sexual abuse that still haunts her. All are students on the same college campus but engage each other from different direction, and each sees her interaction with the others in a very personal and individual viewpoint. Very interesting to see how their personalities color their perceptions of the same situation. A good reminder that we all have demons that only we can see when we work so hard to hide them. All in all, satisfying and uplifting, and I watch this fairly often for that reminder to be kinder to our fellow humans."
1,Another disappointment,"Again, I thought there would be more of a lesbian theme to this movie. Not much action here and somewhat depressing."
5,Sony DCR-TRV20 Digital Camcorder,"There's Nothing Much More To Say, Except That This Camcorder IS God. Get It Now!"
5,Compact and versatile,"I bought this to take on my honeymoon in Jordan. It weighs about the same as a SLR, but you can take single shots as well. The night vision feature is great. By attaching the camera to my computer via a firewire system, I can also capture still shots from the video mode and print them out. I love it. The TRV20 is small enough to slip in a coat pocket with comfort. Around the neck or over the shoulder, it doesn't cut into you because of the wide strap. I wish the lens cap had a cord attached to keep up with it. The reversable viewing screen is wonderful for showing your movies when a TV hookup is not convenient. Over all, once you learn all the buttons and features, this is a dandy little unit for amateur or semi-professional alike."
5,There is no other...,"Fits in the palm of your hand. As small as practically possible without being annoying. The only other camcorder that comes close is the DCR-PC100, which feels very awkward in your hands. They both have the same CCD and the same High Quality Lens. If quality is your main concern... there is no other camcorder to consider."
5,Easy for novices,The DCR-TRV20 is very easy to use for a person who doesn't work with camcorders and digital cameras. The quality of movie as well as digital still pictures makes me glad I spent the extra [money] to get the improved resoluton over the next model down. I also was impressed on how easy it to transport to my computer the stills from the digital camera.
3,Meh.,"Most people have PS2 and can't save PS1 game data on their PS2 memory card. So, they bought this memory card. I have to say that I'm lucky that I only have 2 PS1 games. The only bad thing: 15 blocks. That's a big problem for the people that love sports games. Only get this if you absolutly NEED to save your PS1 data."
2,This thing is too much money! Get the cheaper ones.,"These things cost like 15-20 bucks and they only hold 15 games! That is very cheap. If you are ever going to get a memory card for your PSOne, get the colored cheap ones that come in a 3 pack for 10 bucks. Thats what I got and now I can hold 45 games for less the price. Can you believe that? 10 bucks for 45 games or 17 bucks for 15 games? You choose."
4,That was fast,Was amazed they had the product. Shipping was fast. The packaging was different than the picture on Amazon. Will know if product works on Christmas day. It's a gift for my nephew.
2,Not guaranteed to be Sony brand!!!,"WARNING if you order this! It is NOT guaranteed to be Sony brand, despite the picture and the reviews! I ordered from this exact page, even clicked here from my 'items you ordered' list, but the card I got is most definitely NOT Sony brand. It is a very off-brand 'compatible' card.The page is VERY misleading, and I'm considering returning it. I at least wanted to make it clear to anyone who wants to order this that if you want a name brand Sony card, be very careful."
3,Depends....,"By ""depends"" I mean that it depends on how many games you have.If you have 10+ or at least four sports games you should get about five of these at Funcoland,Gamestop,etc. or any used game shop.You can just wipe out the old information.(It's cheaper that way;) )If you just got a Playstation you should get it here, or if you have a job(you're an adult) you should get it here.But if you have a PS2 you NEED the Sony memory card, like the other reviews said.If you are new to Playstation look on the back of every game near where it lists the accessories it will tell you how many blocks that game uses. This memory card holds 15 blocks.Hope this helped you!PS DON'T BUY 3rd PARTY ANYTHING, THEY USALLY FAIL!"
2,What-EVER,"Woo-hoo. It's a minimalist peripheral. What can I say? It does what it is supposed to do, and NOTHING more. And that is really frustrating as 15 blocks of memory is WAY to little memory to save an even average amount of games. I own the game SaGa Frontier, and I need all 15 blocks for that. So what happens? That's right--Sony gets more of my money.If you are using a PSOne, get a trustworthy 3rd party memory card (InterAct ones work well and hold good amounts). However, if you are using a PS2, I guess you have no choice, data saved on 3rd party cards have the tendency to suddenly get destroyed. Once again, the customer is being sacrificed so they can maximize profit.So the final word? Get it if you have to."
2,How do you rate this?,"Okay. All I want to know is, how in the heck are you supposed to rate something like this? I mean, you have to have it. PS2 users don't get a choice if they want to save one of their PSX games. It's just a matter of &quot;I need it, so I must get it.&quot; Yes, it does stink that there's only 15 blocks. But too bad, there's no other choice. Sorry!"
4,"A Great Memory Card, but too little space","This is a great memory card.Do not buy any other brand of memory card but this brand.THe others tend to erase themselves(My experience)butthis one keeps the data.I got my first sony memory card in 1997 and I saved Parasite Eve and Twisted metal and Crash Bandicoot,I then lost the memory card.I recently found it under my bed and used it.It worked like a charm,it still has my data on it.I advise everyone with a playstation to buy this memory card.I also advise you to buy more than one becauseit has way too little space,I mean 15 blocks,a sports game takes up the entire memory card.This is the reason I gave it 4 stars.This card comes with 2 labels I got a green and a purple with mine.I hope this review was helpful!!Brent"
3,Was okay.,It was okay. I tried it since I wanted one I could use for both. I didn't like it. I have a memory card now that you can save up to 16 blocks a memory card. It has 16 different memory cards in one. and it was five bucks. tada!
3,why should we need it?,"The memory card is ... well, it's just a simple memory card and it does work.The reason I gave it three stars instead of five is that I do not understand why SONY would engineer a supposedly backward compatible device (PS 2) and force you to use a PS 1 memory card for your old games!!"
2,NOT GOOD AT ALL,"THIS MEMORY CARD ISN'T VERY GOOD. INFACT IT IS VERY BAD. I HAVE PS1 AND EVERY GAME TAKES ABOUT 3-4 BLOCKS OF SPACE ON YOUR MEMORY CARD, ( THE MEMORY CARD ONLY HAS 15 BLOCKS TO START WITH) BUT IT DOES DO WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO...SAVE WHAT HAS TO BE SAVED."
1,No fulfillment of the obligations,I still have not received this product.I am very disappointed with your service.
1,I'M MAD AS HELL,memory cards are evil they make me wanna cry. i mean i'm asking for freakin' tracking device in them all i want are memory card's with god damn passwords and if they don't they are pile of crap!!!!!!!!
5,...,"since james benjamins review of this album is a very accurate description of the album i won't write much att all, i agree. this is my favorite pharoah sanders album, withouth the (?)yoddeling(?) of ""jewels of thought"" which is horrible...5 stars..."
1,Do not buy this CD based on title cut Thembi,"I heard Thembi, the title cut, on the local jazz station. I like it. I read the review here, fantastic. That led me to buy this CD. What a huge mistake. I like the title cut. The other cuts are unintelligible garbgage. I am being nice. I encourage you to listen to the sample tracks before you buy this CD. What nonsense these other cuts are; something from the experimental era that didn't work. Sorry, it is the truth. I don't know what the other reviewers are hearing, it is not great jazz. It's not that the players are not great jazz musicians, it is just that they are not enjoyable to listen to unless you like this kind of [...]""."
3,"Cheesy, but catchy","We first found this video at the library. Our then-3-year-old son loved it, and still watches it now that he's 4. The so-so production values and mugging kid actors may come across as cheesy to adults, but the music is catchy, and our son now has a slew of new everyday vocabularly in Japanese. Our Japanese friends with young kids like it better than we do, because the vignettes are slices of Americana such as the zoo, amusement park, birthday party, etc. Since it's bilingual, it works just as well for them teaching rudimentary English.No Oscars are likely, but this video has its own charm."
2,Doesn't hold kid's attention,"This video has the right idea, probably, but doesn't really work in the long run. The japanese language is set to music about commonplace events like going to the zoo, surviving a rainy day, etc. The problem is that the songs are not catchy at all and don't keep the attention of children. The scenes, themselves, are not riveting enough to do it either. Therefore, little ones don't stay in the room to learn anything. My kids are eight years old and very vested in learning Japanese, but they watched the video one and a half times, then put it away forever. When I asked them what they learned, they replied that they didn't know. Unsuccessful for kids in this age group. They went back to watching Seven Samurai and spouting phrases like ""Twelve bandits to the east!"" Even this old black and white movie rivets them more than this vapid little video put out by the folks at Family Circle."
3,Lyric Language Japanese Video,This is a very fast paced tape. The musical background and material is aimed at children. The vocabulary of Japanese words while limited is reinforced thru repetition and music. There was no practice in character recognition as all subtitles were in English. Probably good for early teen or younger. I wish there were more tapes in this series.
5,History of Pentecostalism,"I have heard this man preach for many years, and read several of his books. This particular one, brings out things from an historical view of the charasmatic/pentecostal view. It helps to establish the history of the ""gifts of the Spirit"" and helps show where they have been in the christian movement through out history.I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to start their search of pentecostal history.Shalom, and God bless,"
5,Medical science and suspense.,"An intriguing blend of modern medical science, history and suspense. A fast-paced fun read. Leaves you wondering - ""Could this really happen?"""
2,missing some of the latest information,"Although I thought this book was well written, giving a thorough explanation it lacked some critical information. As an example, there is only brief mention of zinc (and magnesium) deficiencies. Recent studies have shown that supplementing with 35mg of zinc and 250mg of magnesium can increase testosterone levels by 30%. As well there is no discussion of tribulus T!!"
3,Interesting but without specifics,"I found this to be an interesting book on a subject all too frequently overlooked or bypassed as unimportant. The book gives anexcellent overview of concepts, but falls short in recommending any sort of program to improve testosterone levels. Excercise, programs to minimize the effect of SBH, blocking testerone to estrogene conversion etc were touched on but no specifics given."
3,Mildly helpful,"Not much info you can't get in an hour from the internet with a high speed connection.Well written, but that's about it."
2,A dud,"It is hard to believe this line-up of brilliant musicians doesn't really swing very hard on this CD but, contrary to other reviewers, I feel it to be the sad truth...Oscar Peterson is usually capable to ignite even the best swingers to swing harder, Hampton and De Franco have proved their versality by playing with musicians of different generations, the rhythm section is as strong as can be and still it just doesn't really swing. Starting from ""Flying home"", the songs just go on and on..."
5,"Details, details...","If you love baseball, then this book is definitely for you.I enjoyed this book, but the statistic details were a bit much for me. Other than that, the details about foreign players playing baseball in Japan, their culture shock and other tidbits were interesting. Living in Japan, it made me understand some of the quirky things that occur outside the baseball stadiums."
4,You don't even need to know baseball...,"but it helps. I'm not the world's biggest sports fan, and while I could get the gist of some baseball specifics like sacrifice bunts from context, some more esoteric points went over my head. Not many, though, certainly not enough to significantly diminish my appreciation of this book. Anybody (well, anybody American) looking for an entertaining and accessible introduction to some major differences between Japanese and American culture could do a lot worse than ""You Gotta Have Wa"". Managerial styles, notions of work versus play, team spirit, and many other topics of broad interest that transcend baseball are touched on in this book and used to illuminate the differences between our cultures.Ten+ years after the Japanese economic bubble burst, the book does occasionally seem dated. Assumptions about inevitable Japanese global domination common to much of the writing from this period do occur, but don't significantly detract from the book."
5,Adorable book!,"I highly recommend this book. My 2 children really enjoy this book. My son, who is 4, loves to buzz hum, buzz hum, buzz hum hum hum along with the story! Very cute & colorful illustrations along with a good message to bee yourself."
4,Class Reunion Rocks,"National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a murder mystery with a slight twist -- a comic one. The entire movie is a series of funny quips and happenings, making the movie-watcher laugh until their sides ache. Class Reunion is set in an old closed-up school where they are currently having their class reunion, and the people are hilarious, from the snobs to the exchange student from Transylvania. Suddenly people start getting murdered, and the entire party breaks up to find the culprit. The ending is quite a surprise, and I think you will enjoy it as much as I do. There are a few big names in this movie, but at that time they were so young, it's strange to see them. All in all, this movie is great, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch it. Compared to all the other National Lampoon movies, I would say it is most like Animal House with it's comedy. I would rate it as one of the classics of the 80's!"
4,class reunion,this is something remind me of my high school in the sixtys. this is good movie for being so corny butt it at least not big on lot of gore and has some little funny things that leave you kinda in a good mood
3,Calculator.,"My old calculator died and I needed a new one for Astronomy. This one fit the bill and because of it's orange color, it stands out from everyone elses."
5,Voices by Anne Garber,This is a very compelling novel! I was unable to put it down until reading every page! Really keeps the reader intrigued all the way to the end. The authoress has done a fine job in keeping the reader guessing the identity of the killer until the very final chapter of the book. It is spell binding and well written. I would highly recommend it for reading by all. Looking forward to many other novels by Anne Garber. I enjoy her style of writing.
5,13th bday present,My daughter opened it and was excited. She loves her new phone and it is easy to manage.
1,Basic Phone,The battery for this phone needs charging everyday even when not in use. Phone drops call after 5 minutes.
1,AQUA TECH ISSUES,"Hello, I purchased this charger from AQUAtech and they shipped it to me, but they sent the wrong one. So I tried to contact them to send it back and I had to wait for a week for a response. Finally they said to send it to the address they provided and they would issue a refund. I never received the refund, and I have tried several times to contact them with no response at all. Buyer beware, DONT BUY FROM AQUATECH....."
3,Sony Battery Charger for camcorder M series,Ii works great and was a real sony product. Lots better having two ways to charge the batteries plus this way is easier. Should be FIVE STARS1111111Hit Wrong key first time.
2,Not as fun as the old one,I was hoping this would be a little more like the classic game and I was disappointed.
3,Lemmings in the round....,"I was originally looking for the first Lemmings game but was unable to find it. So I purchased Lemmings Revolution. It's a lot of fun and uses your brain just a bit. Nothing to strain the brain, but you do have to figure out placement and strategy for the Lemmings. To make it more interesting there are 2 Lemming drop points and they both go in opposite directions around a barrel shaped playing field. So you have to be quick sometimes or half of your Lemmings are already gone. Basic premise is to get the required number of Lemmings from the start point to the hot air balloon so they can fly off to freedom, overcoming obstacles on the way."
2,Lemmings,The game installs on Vista but I've not be able to control the Lemmings the way I should be able to.
1,Lacks Technical Support,"The worst thing about this game is the lack of technical support. I don't know if the game is fun or not. I'm still trying to contact the ""technical support"" department to get help. All they provide is an email address. The game didn't load on my computer and I sent an email asking for help. One week later I still have had no response from the ""support"" team. If you visit the website it refers you to the email address. In short, they don't care whether the product works, or not."
3,Bubble Bath - Sheer Pale Pink,"OPI Bubble Bath is a very sheer pale pink color. Probably good for french manicures, but not for full coverage. I found this color to be streaky and not my favorite OPI shade."
3,Misleading Title,"""Classical"" is exactly what this album is. Whether it's ""Dance"" is questionable. I was looking for classic rather than modern Egyptian bellydance music. This one isn't bad for listening, but there are only a few songs that you'd want to dance to. The rest sound more like classical music with an Egyptian flavor and are not very inspiring for dance. All of them are slow beats and some are painfully slow. The last track is an eight minute tabla piece but the drumming has kind of a stutter - it's uneven, boring and sounds ""off."" It may be good to have around if you plan to have a piece that calls for this type of music or if you like listening to it. Otherwise, save your money."
4,Pricking the bubbles,"This little book is more than worth its minimal cost. As a general guide to the history of the great drink it's somewhat sketchy, but if you want the word on what Champagne to order and what not to (for the same price), it will provide just that. Follow its 9 or so top marques and you almost cannot go wrong. More than that though, it identifies some superb non-vintage Champagnes from less-well-publicised houses. Some I found in Epernay sell (unbelieveably) for less than 90 francs ($11) at the cave door -- half the price of the book. Though the 3 category ratings are relatively useful, a more finely discriminating set (say 5) would have been much better as a guide, particularly where the 2-star marques are concerned. Reading between the lines though you may be able to tell which 2-stars are better than others. As other reviwers have noted, it is now a bit dated: the '99 edition surprisingly fails to mention the '95 vintage at all. A well revised edition would be welcome."
1,Michelin Guide to Main Cities of Europe,Useful guide in English for European travellers. Saves trawling through the guide to each country if you are just doing a quick city visit. Very difficult to get hold of in the UK so Amazon saves the day!
3,How to find contents?,"Not a review of this book-I just want to know which cities are covered in this volume, and can't seem to find out from the Amazon website. I'm interested in Venice. I'm not going to buy the book if I can't find out if Venice is a ""Europe Main City"". How about some information?"
2,The Younger Man,"I read it because I thought it would get better. The title was the hook, but the book was more about the women turning 40. That made the plot wind all over and nothing seemed to be done in detail."
3,"OK, nothing special","This is not a typical romance novel. No real sex or passion. I did find it an interesting book about women turning 40. Joe, the romantic interest, was very one dimensional - not interesting at all. But, Hazel, was very complex.I liked the British terms and slang -- kinda fun."
5,A useful corrective to official versions of feminism,"I strongly disagree with the reviewer who gives Wagner's book only 1 star. While the book is by no means flawless, it also has important strengths. Wagner offers an accessible history of one small portion of feminism and corrects the mistaken assumption that feminism is a ""white women's"" idea and movement."
5,An Excellent Book!,An interesting look at how the Native American culture affected the women's movement in the US.
1,Disappointed,The item was damaged when I received it and it was a present. now I have ordered a new one to replace this one.
4,Costomer Service is EVERYTHING,"I searched all over the web for my golf ball display and amazon by far had the best product as well as the best price without those hidden costs for tax shipping ...Upon receipt of my item iI noticed a small bit of damage to my item, I called the costomer service number provided and spoke to a person on the phone (not a machine) but a person. I told the person about the damage and asked do I have to wrap it up and ship it back (a big pain) to get a replacement? I was informed I did not have to bother resending the damaged one and a new one would be sent out in 2 days. Two days later my new un-damaged one arived. OUTSTANDING service, I have since used amazon one other time and wil do so many more times in the future. Buster Stancil (Hawaii)"
4,Love it,"I bought this as a gift for my brother the golfer and when he opened it, he loved it. It did arrive with a couple of scratches but other than that its a real nice looking piece."
2,Golf Ball Cabinet,"I had to return the first cabinet I received because it had over 10 gashes in the wood; it looked terrible. The replacement they sent me was a little better, but still had some scratches on the wood plus lots of scratches on the plexi-glass. They said they couldn't send me another one because the problem is more widespread than they originally realized."
1,Light for Gameboy Failed to Meet Expectations,I bought this for my grandson's Gameboy since he was unable to see the screen. He still couldn't see the screen very well and the item was not well made and broke soon after we purchased it.
5,Harry Potter Slytherin Scarf,The scarf was 100% lambs wool making it lovely and soft. Excellent quality and well finished.
2,Not what I expected,The items were all thrown in the bag with no instructions or documents to understand what the kit had. Also the flashlight is worthless. I payed $20 and it was to expensive for this bad quality.
3,I Don't Get It,"I don't like this one particularly. People have gone on and on about this release for years, but I just don't hear why. I recommend Mingus' other recordings, which are less formally structured but which I find more coherent and impressive."
4,"great, but not quite what expected","this makes awesome workout (elliptical, running, treadmill) music for interval training; wonderfully paced..... can just SEE a Martha Graham choreo. to it while you work out!"
2,The Black Saint,"This was the fisrt Mingus album I collected, and I have been searching through his catalogue for its equal ever since. Sure, his earlier work on Columbia (think ""Mingus Ah Um"") was truly special, but nothing I've heard captures the spirit of this tortured master quite as well. The compositions are Trane-like: frenetic, ethereal, abstract, haunting. While recording for Impulse!, these two should have gotten together.If you're not familiar with free jazz and the avant-garde, this album will be a wake-up call. Mingus had previously worked the standards routine in his own deranged kind of way (think ""The Complete Town Hall Concert"" on Blue Note), but this album certainly shows that there was something brewing underneath. If he had lived longer, it would have been interesting to see where he could have taken this fire, how he would have allowed it to spread."
1,the black poo and the poo lady,This album only has four songs. Wow what a rip off. You could buy a Kenny G album and get like TEN four minute songs. One of these songs is 20 minutes. Who listen to a 20 minute song? LOL. This is the worst album I've ever herd.
4,"Churning, intense","""Black Saint"" opens with a bluesy sax solo over a distressed two chord pattern. The music slows, and then it's back to the churning. The rest of the CD continues this pattern in different ways. This isn't easy-time stuff, but it's excellent. Some have called this Mingus' best album. I still like Ah Um the best, but this might be next-best. Since this is a larger band, with 10 or 11 players (there's a few moments of flamenco guitar), the individual voices of the soloists get covered up to a certain degree. Everyone plays very well, and in true Mingus fashion many of the notes are slid into, not just played straight. The album is Mingus' long-form composition masterpiece. I recommend this to anyone who likes Mingus, the blues, or jazz big bands. As a bonus, the liner notes were written by Mingus' psychologist."
5,Simply put: one of the greatest jazz albums of all time,"In 1963, Mingus made an album that seamlessly incorporated and transcended about half a dozen different genres in one slab of work. ""Black Saint..."" is a simply amazing piece of music that could only come from the likes of a maverick such as Charles Mingus.Starting off sounding like the soundtrack to a film noir thriller, all brooding low-end horns and shuffling drums, it proceeds to explode into a free-jazz-inspired blowout before traversing itself through the hinterlands of latin rhythms, flamenco guitar, big band swing, avant-garde blasts and be-bop honks. Almost like a collaged musical suite, ""Black Saint..."" speaks like a living document on the history of jazz within its grooves. A truly brilliant piece of work that warrants repeated listens and will appeal to fans of both the experimental and more traditional wings of jazz.For the record, one of the great Lester Bangs' all-time favourite jazz albums, so you know you're onto a good thing."
5,I Don't Understand But That's a Good Thing,"I've listened to a lot of music from Rush to Dream Theater to Pink Floyd to Opeth, to Porcupine Tree to Genesis to the Mars Volta but I've never heard anything like this before in my life. I've never heard half these instruments. What is that? Where did it come from? I feel like a kid in a zoo of scary and amazing animals. I really have no idea what's going on but it reminds me of my childhood. The odd instruments sound like the sounds my old grandfather used to make when he was sitting on the rocking chair with his wife, my grandmother, in his lap, smoking away at his pipe. I really don't know how to describe it.The only negative of this purchase is the cover art that seems to display a man engaged in illicit activity ranging from drugs, to prostitution to terrorism. But cover aside (you can just rip it off or throw away the case) this is one of the best albums I've ever bought."
5,WoW,One of the greatest recordings I've ever heard. The horns just wail and the music is wonderful. Enjoy.
3,A Good Book For Men,"I purchased this book to help me to better understand men and marriage. I am newly married, and needed help understanding my husband. I think this book is a good book for any man to read who is thinking about getting married. It offers a lot of practical advice to protect yourself and your marriage. This book reveals how easily it is for men to get involved with women outside their marriage if they don't know what signs to look for before an affair starts to develop."
1,Not Tough Enough,"The author could have been stronger with his suggestions about boundaries in a healthy marriage - especially anyone who buys this book, since they probably have problems in this area.He was a bit loose with what he thought was acceptable behavior. For example: Common sense will tell you that any flirting or a close friendship of the opposite sex is inappropriate in a marriage (and just opening the door for trouble). He was way too easy on the guilty party who is ruining the marriage with this kind of childish, selfish, nonsense.He didn't take it far enough. It was like he was trying to protect the ego of anyone who might be reading this (at the suggestion of their spouse), and was afraid to just come on out and say, ""Hey...you can't do this, AT ALL - it's NOT cool.""If you are the spouse of someone who does not build ""Hedges"", this book will anger you and make you feel more victimized, instead of hopeful for a change."
5,Hedges,"A great book to read as a couple, and practically put into action in your life. Start today, whether it's day 1 or day 10,000."
3,Birth Control tramples the hedges! :(,"Great points made in this book! But it misses a huge concern: Birth Control. It's the reason why so many cheat. Admit it! When you use birth control you block God's creative power, and that is sin. Pray that the scales fall off! Read ""Theology Of The Body"" by Christopher West. God bless!"
5,Great book on marriage,"This is a great book for married couples. We need to protect our marriages with forethought and fortitude. Purity can be damaged so easily, so we have to work hard to remain pure and faithful in our marriages. Hedges helps us think through practical ways to guard our lives and our marriages, glorifying God and honoring our spouses."
4,She's a dirty rockstar.........,"I have the Pixel Chix Pixel Pets Jammin' Hamster and here's what I say.It's a very nice thing but don't stay in the secret world too long! When you go back there will be cobwebs. Just press the broom and it will go away.TIP ALERT: When you go up a level, after you see the code, press the checkmark and you will go up another level and get another code! You can even do it again and go on the last level!(Hold down all the bottons on the side with 3 bottons in normal mode and it shows your hamster's litter!Don't forget to name your hamster! I named mine Hammiella/Ella. NO STEALING MY HAMSTER'S NAME OR ELSE!!!!!!!They should move the hamster drinking up to the wheel floor thingy.OVERALL: 4 starsOut."
5,Fun toy,The 12 year old girl who got this toy loves it. These Pixel Chix games seem to be very entertaining products.
2,Homemade Video..?,"I was not impressed with this video. It was overpriced for the quality, it looked like it was shot a few years ago on a camcorder. I am very disappointed that I spent $20 on this and it was the most expensive mx video available, so I was expecting a little more."
5,A classic,"This video was pleasant surprise, it is not the thrash and trash usually found in motocross videos. It is suitable for viewers of all ages, the whole family enjoyed it. The section on Dave Jackson was especially inspiring, not just for the physically challenged but to all human beings in general, thank you Dave for being Dave. ""PeeWee to Pros"" also demonstrates the comradeship among the riders and their clans. Well Worth the price."
2,"Peewees to Pros, Motocross Family and Friends","Action was so-so. The sound track was poor. This video, as the title indicates, is geared for family level entertainment. There were some helpful hints for kids, such as, race starts. The quality of the competition footage was ""do-it-yourself"" video. If I were you I'd pass on this one."
3,Confused 20Q,"The 20Q Sports is not as thorough as the original 20Q. It makes a lot more errors. For example, when you answer that the item is not a person, one of the questions it asks is whether it is black. In the case of a baseball, when you enter ""no"", it still asks if the item is...and it proceeds to name an African American sports person."
3,20Q Sports,"I had a difficult time finding this item in the stores even though they advertised it. I was able to get it through Amazon, however. The game is wrong about 50% of the time and I think the company was quick to get these manufactured for the holidays and has not worked out all of the kinks yet."
4,Sports Stumper,This game is great for the sports fan. If you don't know much about the various sports then it is not for you. But if you are a fan the game is great fun.
3,20Q Sports,"not as thorough as 20Q (general). It could not guess I was thinking of Ted Williams, so I am less than major impressed."
3,horrible,"I read this book on life in India with great interest till the description of the young boy permanently damaged by his teacher.That was very hard to view with any"" humor and great intelligence"". maybe I'm overly sensitive but the author wasn't just objective but cold."
3,What is the meaning?,"I read this book on the high recommendation of a friend. As an Indian-American, I have first hand knowledge of the general chaos and disorganization that one can encounter in India. In this book, compounding the India experience are the eccentric personalities that are drawn to the ashram where the author spent her adolescent years. The first few chapters seemed to poke humor in these aspects. Then, the chapters become more dark, with scenes of child abuse and neglect. Most of the numerous characters didn't have any appeal and, while you could feel how disconnected Mani was growing up, the reader is left feeling disconnected from the book. The alternating time periods in the book from her growing up years in the ashram to flashes of her current life made me think there would be some rekoning with the pain and sadness of her early years. But I did not find it."
2,"Yes, we know you're intelligent.","I hate to disagree with my Fellow Readers, but I found this to be an insufferable diatribe about how intelligent the author is. Yes, we know she was an early reader. Yes, we know she had a terrific vocabulary by the age of 7. I was so tired of hearing how bright this child was that I found it hard to finish the book. As an American Educator, I found her mother's quote insulting as well; ""American schools don't know how to deal with kids as bright as you are."" Give me a break; we are trained to enrich as we are trained to remediate~her experience shouldn't be fodder for such an unfair generalization. Maybe she should have elected to edit her mother's comment or leave it out altogether. At any rate, I have better things to do with my summer vacation than finish this essay. I did enjoy some of the snippets into Indian and ashram life so if you can get by this author's attempt to hit you over the head with her brilliance, it may be worth your while."
1,Not worth it!,"If you think quotes from Lucille Ball, Aesop, Herman Melville or Marlene Dietrich can help you survive - then this book is for you!It offers 355 'pearls of wisdom' - such as:#270:Talk to yourself out loud#326:The best way out is always through (Robert Frost)#289:Hindsight is always twenty-twenty (Billy Wilder)In hindsight - I wouldn't have wasted my money."
2,"A bit anachronistic, writing style sloppy","The story was moderately interesting, but the chauvinistic attitudes of the 70s show through in Cussler's treatment of Teri, and Dirk Pitt just was not a character I warmed up to much. I remember having fonder memories of Raise the Titanic, but I read that more than 20 years ago as a teenager. Those are my only two Cussler books I've read, but I'm hoping to give a few more a whirl to see how it matures. There is promise here, it's just clearly a very early start to a writing career. The Kindle edition was fine, no gripes or complaints on formatting or ease of reading."
2,Not the same Dirk Pitt.,"As an avid reader of Clive Cussler novels it is always a pleasure to read a Dirk Pitt novel. The storyline and plot are inventive and believable, but Dirk Pitt actions and dialog are contrary to most other Clive Cussler novels. Case in point is his treatment of the Baron's daughter, which is crude and out of character.I checked the publication date and discovered it was 2004, several years ago. All though the book I felt as if the novel was written by someone other than Clive Cussler. Maybe it is that the main character has matured over the years."
4,Oregon File fans will like the earlier work too!,"I happily ripped through the Oregon Files and wanted more... so I thought I'd try Cussler's earlier Dirk Pitt series. This is the first Pitt Adventure I've read. I thoroughly enjoyed the simpler throw-back to a less complicated time. Unlike the one-legged, blond-haired, blue-eyed and complicated Latino- Juan Cabrillo, who relies on the stealthy high tech gadgetry on his state-of-the art vessel, Dirk Pitt is more like one of Captain America's army pals. So I found the Mediterranean Caper to be crisper, and cleaner- if somewhat slower. But it still maintained my interest from the first page until the very end. Some of the vivid- if somewhat stereotypical, characters in this book remind me of roles portrayed in the ""The Love of Four Colonels,"" a play by Peter Ustinov. I'm not sure which series I will end up liking the most, but I do know, I'm in all the way for the rest of the Dirk Pitt series! 4 Stars!"
1,Horrible,"This is by far the worst of the Dirk Pitt novels, I have read many of them and in my opinion this was almost as though an undersexed high school student had written it. Don't bother buying it if you have read other cussler novels this one will surely disapoint you."
3,The Mediterranion Caper,"Have really enjoyed all of Clive Cussler's works with the Oregon Filesand the Numa Files, but this was somewhat short and not sure I feel goodwith Dirk Pitt's charachter. But was a good book and enjoyed reading it,just left me looking for other things from him and now am reading theFargo Adventures and do like it."
2,Med Caper,"This is my first Dirk Pitt caper. Having read other Cussler work which I enjoyed and noting references to Dirk Pitt, I was looking forward to experiencing more. I am disappointed in the Pitt character - seems unreal."
5,Excellent Book!,Nobody writes em like Clive Cussler...sort of like James Bond meets Jacque Cousteau. Excellent book for history and science lovers...and there is always a twist...can you spot Clive Cussler's character in the book? I love that part...he always inserts himself into his work. I know of no other author who does that. Hope you enjoy the read! This is my 2nd time around :o)
3,Charlie Chan with a wet suit,"This is a remake of the 1930's Charlie Chan mysteries, right down to the last chapter where Dirk Pitt explains how he solved the mystery. Everything is there except the drawing room.This is a true action novel, complete with misdirection, the indestructible Dirk Pitt, bad guys who turn out to be good guys (and vice versa), and dime novel dialogue. However, if you have time to waste, it's a good time-waster!"
3,Good mix of action and history,"The Mediterranean Caper by Clive Cussler is my first Dirk Pitt novel and it has encouraged me to read the rest of the series.The book revolves around a major in the US Air Force, Dirk Pitt. This man travels around the world solving problems for NUMA (a research branch). When in Greece, a WWI plane attacks the main base and destroys the planes. Dirk must find out what in the world is going on. He faces over whelming odds, but that does not stop this hero.I found this book to be a little too fast. The character kinda jumped around. In one scene Dirk is in a tunnel, yet it is hard to tell how he got there.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a nice relaxing read. The book is a page-turner."
4,It is really rivating.,"I thought this book was really well written,even though it is one of his earlier works."
3,Standard Dirk Pitt - see where it all began!,"Manly men on a manly mission - lighter on technology than Cussler's later offerings. I won't say more believable, but less prepostrous (sp?) than the Dirk Pitt books from the last few years."
2,"Fun story, badly written","It's a decent enough yarn but atrociously written. The protagonist Dirk Pitt is a James Bondish action caricature, and the dialogue is cliched and corny. People behave and speak in laughably unnatural ways: within an hour of meeting the female lead on an Aegean beach, Pitt slaps her smartly in the face for dwelling excessively on her dead husband. She comes to her senses, and within minutes they're making love on the beach. I'm serious - it's that dumb.If there were no other authors working this genre, I might be inclined to give Cussler another try, but as it stands there are too many out there who can write a good story AND a good sentence."
4,Good read,I like all CUSSLER booksThis is an early one but still enjoyable. I recommend CRescent Dawn and Poseidon's Arrow
3,Not what I expected.,"This Dirk Pitt is not the Pitt I have read in newer release. His slapping the face of a girl he just met is not the Pitt I have come to regard as a man of refinement. This early addition Pitt has now been refined to a gentleman that others could envy. If there had not been a metamorphosis into present day Pitt, I would not be searching for other Pitt stories. Overall, I found this book to be a bit cruder than later stories by Cussler."
2,Early Dirk Pitt is Kind of a Jerk,This early version of Dirk Pitt is pretty foul. He is written as a disrespectful jerk to both his friends and to women. Glad he matured in the later books. The story is interesting- but he is a hero that is difficult to like.
3,just started the book - slapping strange woman gets him laid...lol,"I have to say, I just started this book in Audio format. Reader sounds like the guy who did the travis McGee books and right off the bat I got a little dose of woman slapping misogyny....our hero slaps a stranger he has met because she still grieves after 8 years since her husband's death. She rewards him by letting him have sex with her on the beach. Is that how its done...I need to head out to local beaches and see how this approach goes. After I made it to this passage I paused to check the publication date thinking to find a 60s or earlier date to account for the backward attitude toward women...but Nope.. Modern. Ah well, I'll soldier on and see what this one holds. Gave this 3 stars because I'm just starting it."
3,A good first try,It is easy to tell that this is Cussler's first Pitt novel. His writing hasn't matured at this point.
3,Read another Cussler first,"I believe that this is the novel that was published only after Cussler became popular--to cash in on his sure-sales. It's definitely not his most polished work. It was good to get another adventure from Dirk and Al, but it's definitely one to read after reading all the others."
3,Talk about a women hater!,"While I found this to be an ok story, it is definately dated in the author's/main character's attitude towards women. I know it was written a long time ago, but I still find Pitt's actions towards women mildy offensive. He is like the uber manly character of most adolescent fantasies i.e strong male character dragging a women towards his cave by the hair. anyway, that being said, the story isn't bad, but at the same time very corny/cliqued. Worth reading once, but I wouldn't buy it. Try the library."
3,The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt),"Very early Clive Clussler. The characters have yet to develop and in fact are being developed over the series of books. Slow going at first but livens up toward the middle moving to the end.If you want to see where the characters start at, this is one of the books to read. (Dirk Pitt and pals)."
2,"Good, but certainly not his best","I PICKED THIS BOOK UP AFTER reading 4 other cussler novels. I wasn't disappointed, but this this book just doesn't grip you like the others. It is less involved and the ending was quick. A good read for a train or plane, it is short and goes quickly."
2,Don't let this be your first Cussler book,"Look, this is a very early work - and the edges are really rough. The writing is pretty stilted. The plot plays games with the reader. The attitude towards women is really wretched. It isn't a terribly good book by any measure. Read this book if you are already a Cussler fan and you want to explore his early works. Don't read this as your first exposure to Cussler. You might well not give him a second chance - and some of his other books are really quite good. My personal favorites are _Raise the Titanic_ and _Night Probe_. Those are also pretty early efforts, but even a couple of books past _The Mediterranean Caper_ he had settled down into a pretty darned effective writer who could tell a good tale without totally annoying the average reader. If you already gave this book a try and hated it - try one of the above two before you give up on Cussler entirely."
5,Great Adventure !!!,"A great book from start to finnish...... Cant wait to read the rest of the Dirk Pitt series. Im sure they will be jsut as good if not better. Check this book out, its a great book and a fast read. Also check out any books from AJ Quinnell (Man on Fire, Siege of Silence.....Check them all out !!!!)"
2,Mediterranean Caper,"I am a Clive Cussler Fan and normally love his Dirk Pitt books but this one I did not like because the Dirk character was very different than I am used to. He angered very easily,swore a lot and was not a likable person. It was one of Clive's earlier novels and I guess the character Dirk Matured in his later novels. I do not recommend this book to anyone but read his later ones they are great!I have read at least 20 of Clive's books."
1,Mediterranean Caper,"This can't be a Clive Cussler book!!! Thankfully I have read all other books by him and his ""ghosts"" This one was wretched! Pitt was a foul mouth rapist with few redeeming features. It's hard to believe Cussler turned this pig's ear into a silk purse. Do NOT read this book."
2,Really dated...,"This was my first Cussler novel, and while I liked the plot, I felt that it was not well-written. In addition to being somewhat offensive to women, the narrator used trite expression after trite expression. Really it was irritating."
1,Amazon misleading marketing,"This was Cussler's first Dirk Pitt novel. I would not have bought this if I had not been mislead by Amazon. On your website, you represent this book as published in 2004. It was actually first published in 1973. I read most of the Dirk Pitt early novels and as the character has progressed, he is much more entertaining. In closing, I would have never bought this novel if you had accurately stated it was first published in 1973. If you search my buying history, I am a regular customer. Shame on Amazon for this misleading marketing."
3,"Okay overall, but somewhat cheesy and cloying","Of the excellent Verve collection (Samba, Bossa-Nova, Forro, Afro-Brasil) this is easily the weakest release. Some good songs here, for sure, but others are strikingly thin and synthed-up. Instead, go with the Samba disc, or better yet, ""Samba Roots""."
3,Entertaining,"I went on a Jerome Jerome kick and decided to read everything he wrote, in no particular order. I don't recommend this practice, because after a few you realize that it's all a blur! And now I have trouble distinguishing this title from the rest. But I can say that they are all clever, witty and outdated in a fun way (learn something about ""olden"" times - and that people and their cares have been the same for centuries). As the author ages his circumstances change (marriage, kids, etc.), so it would have helped to know their chronological order and follow it before I started the endeavor. It's been a few months (and dozens of books) since I read this, and I don't remember the premise - which may be all you need to know as a recommendation on whether or not to read it :)."
2,Ok for the price,"It's not a bad price for the complete set, but the performance level matches the price. Slow, lacking passion, somewhat out-of-tune; if you're looking to familiarize yourself with the pieces, this isn't bad, but if you're looking for a virtuoso performance, this isn't it."
4,Great Purchase,"My daughter-in-law got a new laptop and I was unable to locate a bag that did not look like a briefcase,locally. She wanted something that looked similar to a pursse. Found this on Amazon, it matches her briefcase and her laptop (17"") fits it perfectly. The red lining is beautiful. She loved the Christmas Gift. Thanks Amazon"
3,Lage Milano Handbag,"This bag is massive. I ordered the large one because I wanted to make sure that I had enough space. Well, it turns out that this one had too much space and I had to return it for the smaller version. It would have been way too large for commuting on the train.Further, the bag is very rectangular but I feel that the photos make it look more like a large handbag. I was definitely expecting something more ""angled"" on top."
1,Ritz Camera SUCKS,"I'm sure this product is fine. But don't order it through Amazon, through Ritz Camera. They just cancelled my order without warning, having listed that the bag was available. Freaking idiots."
5,Great,This was a great fit for a large laptop computer. This product is very useful and sylish for a female professional.
4,"Big enough for my 17.3"" Dell Inspiron","When you have a widescreen laptop, you know that finding a bag that is stylish with the right dimensions can be tough. I was so glad when I came across this bag. As reported by other reviewers, that bag is not as tapered as the photo would indicate. It is more rectangular. The interior is nicer than expected. The red interior of the black bag makes it easy to find things in the roomy interior. It is a well made bag. Leather would have been nice, but I'm sure it would have made the bag price astronomical with the quantity needed for this size bag. The croc-embossed vinyl is high quality and I have no qualms about taking this bag anywhere. I'm a snob when it comes to material content, but this bag is a quality item and I would buy it again. If you need a bag for a large laptop, grab this one because you aren't going to find anything in this price range that is better. Recommended~!"
2,Extremely Large,"I was so excited to get this bag, which I expected to be stylish and professional...however, it just looked like a very plain and huge purse. It was high quality, and the interior was very nice. However, I would have been completely embarrassed to lug this monster around."
3,An Atypical Shirley Horn with Orchestra but Chemistry Failed,The best singer ever. The finest musicians around. Everything perfect but Ms.Horn conceptions are missing. Seems like they got everything ready and then asked her come and croon. A quite professional twofer but ... this is not the Ms. Horn's material to be remembered forever.
3,Mediocre Prose,"Man, I really wish Punke was a better writer. There were many times that I set this book down after a reading sesion and found that I might rather not pick it up again. It's a tribute to the fascinating true tale of Hugh Glass, his determination to survive and drive for revenge that I was able to choke down this book. I'm not sure if this will make sense, but I wish I read like a novel, rather than a novelization of a true story as penned by a historian. The internal thought processes were hammy, the secondary characters were carictures and any moment that felt like there was supposed to have emotional heft came across as trite.But I did finish the book, and felt like I got some historical context out of it, so it wasn't a total waste."
1,Hugh Glass would roll over in his grave,"If you enjoy the story of Hugh Glass and like at least a little historical accuracy, then don't read this book. It takes the story of Glass and makes a comedy of the entire struggle. I had to force myself to read the book and hoped that it would get better as it goes. Not so! The book takes a fantastic struggle of the west and makes it so fictious that it makes one cringe as you read it. I gave my copy away rather than take someone's money for it."
5,This book Changed my life,"Krishna, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, Bach, Gross. My life had gone through a period of stark decline. I had recently been downsized by the New Lab of the Dalton School. And my monkey died. Mr. Gross is a contemporary prophet, on a par with Pat Robertson and Darryl Strawberry. and Darryl Strawberry. His gospel on borrowing has shown me the path to enlightenment. Mr. Gross, you are the proverbial Lorax. You do speak to the trees."
5,American Pie,"A long long time ago, I can still remember how that music used to make me smile. And I new if I had my chance, that I could make those people dance and, maybe they'd be happy for awhile. But February made me shiver, with every paper I delivered. Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step. I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride. But something touched me deep inside, the day the music died."
5,Lemmings!,"To all the fools who gave this masterpiece three stars or less: I pity you and your pathetic view of literature.To those who gave it 4 stars or more: you have my thanks and congratulations as true literary conoisseurs.To those who have not yet read the story, ignore the reviews and draw your own conclusions after you have done so.To those who complain that the birth of the creature was underwritten, consider this: Frankenstein did not wish for anyone, ANYONE, to have the knowledge and/or the ability to repeat his mistake. Thus, he deliberately left the birth of his creation vague in order to prevent any details of his knowledge from escaping into the world.Next time you read a book, perhaps you should actually READ it rather than just looking at the pretty letters."
1,1818 Text?,"I was quite excited when I got Frankenstein, but then I saw that it was not the 1818 text, but rather the 1831 text...which is not the text that is being read for my class. So the stars aren't a reflection of the how good or bad the book is, but that I did not get a 1818 text."
4,Worthwhile,"I just finished reading Frankenstein (first time I've read it). I was surprised that I actually liked it! I imagined it would be dull. The story moved along at a good pace. I especially liked how much emotion was expressed by the characters, and the parallels that can be drawn from Frankenstein's creation that haunts him and things we create in our own lives that may do the same."
4,Frankenstein,I am very happy with this product. The book was in great condition and makes a good read. It has kept readers engaged over so many decades
4,Pickin' A Nit,"Sure woulda liked it if the CD was split up into tracks, instead of one long track. Sure is annoying to have to listen to the whole thing in one sitting or not at all. Also, Leonard Feather has always been a bit square- and he does half the music. The MINGUS half is MINGalicious! Otherwise- please refer to the other more helpful reviewers re:actual content of CD."
3,Everything's great except...,"It's just one big track and on the back of the packaging, it clearly lists multiple tracks.The audio quality is not bad, as expected, but come on. Everytime I want to listen to any part of it, it's back to the beginning! Luckily, I just got the cd after losing my original 7 years ago and so it's all pretty exciting.However, I have a feeling like this is going to get more and more annoying as time goes on.No need to really review the album's artistic merit. If you're interested in it, you've already got a good idea of what you're getting in for."
1,Smooshed,Not what I had hoped at all. It bake smooshed in the package. Looked nothing like the picture. My daughter couldn't even wear it
1,All Monsters were medium sized at best.,"I got this movie because it promised both little AND big monsters. All I got was a bunch of medium sized monsters. I've seen both bigger and smaller monsters than this movie gave me.I went in expecting to be entertained by little monsters, the smallest monster was like cat sized? Really? Cats? I've seen cats before. So you'd think, if they can't get the little monsters right they could possible do big monsters justice huh? NOPE, the biggest monster was at best big boned, not even large. I've seen bigger monsters rolling around on the electric carts at Walmart.The animation was passable for like 1920's computer generated graphics but this is 2012, you think these guys could afford a Lisa or maybe a Commodore PET computer by now.If you're looking for little or big monsters, look elsewhere."
5,Great magazine!,"Pittsburgh magazine is a great resource for anyone living in or around the city, whether you are new or have lived here your whole life. It has monthly restaurant reviews, and features like Top Doctors, Best Restaurants and the Best of Pittsburgh. The annual City Guide is very helpful, filled with listings for everything from shopping and dining to churches and schools."
2,Spiraling down,"This used to be a really great city mag, full of humor and style that made it must reading for people in the area. But now it's stiff and unimaginative. Pass on this one."
4,"Pure genious, plain and simple!","Boy, howdy, I'll tell you what! That there is a fine piece of film. I haven't been so tickled in all my life. I'm telling you, this is a must-see movie right here. It's got all the good stuff; comedy, superior acting, lots of plot twists, murder, lawncare... what's not to love. Buy this bad boy right now, you won't regret it. Great date movie, too... I showed this to some ladie friends of mine, and WHOO WHOOOOOOOO!!!! Y'all know what I'm sayin'. Buy this movie!"
3,So corny bad it's fun,"This is one of those movies that's bad -- but in an goofy, entertaining way, something you'd watch with your buddies and some beers when you don't have something more profound to do.It's also the first movie about which I've ever had some inside scoop. My friend J. was formerly roommates with Kevin Greene (writer, producer, co-director, played ""Chip"") back in Georgia, and this film featured several of their buddies. (I guess they're all those previous reviewers from Georgia).So yeah, I'm sure I appreciated the movie more than I otherwise would have thanks to J.'s running commentary and anecdotes. Supposedly, the seeds of this film were planted when the two started joking about what if a horror film featured a guy getting his nards caught in a golfball cleaner, and evolved from there. Hey, it's weird but it's fun, and better than a lot of things you end up watching."
1,the greenskeeper hu?,"well its an ok movie, thought the tennis guy was a little lame, he acts so gay, john rocker did alot better then i expected,but, don't give up pitching. Larry and Eric should have had more screen time. overall its an OK movie. would not buy it but i did burn a copy from a friend"
3,So Bad it's Good!,"I really tried to like this movie, but the lack of acting skills, special effects and plot, made this movie hard to swallow. I gave it every opportunity to redeem itself, but this has to be the worst movie ever made. I am even ashamed to show it to my friends as a joke. Next time I want to waste my time, I'll sit down and watch old episodes of My Little Pony istead of watchin The Greenskeeper again."
5,Highly Recommended,"Wow! What a film. This film is a breath of fresh air compared to other horror films in the last couple of years. The Milkman is probably my favorite character of all. YOU MUST BUY THIS FILM!!!Oh yeah, and F-You Steve!!"
3,It isn't that Funny,"First, let me say I'm a big Bob Hope fan. I have always enjoyed him and watched many of his Road movies and a few others that were on TV. I purchased this movie and my wife and I watched about half and turned it off. It was too much stick and playing to the camera. One scene where Hope is in a bar while Roy Rogers sings the Song Buttons and Bows, Hope adds his own lyrics to the song at the end and you think the scene will never end. I believe there are better Bob Hope movies than this one. Sorry to say I was disappointed. I'm sure the film is appealing to many others and do not wish to anger those fans. But my wife and I just didn't find this one any more enjoyable than most Jerry Lewis films."
5,"One of Ol' Slope-Nose's best, and Jane Russell - WOW!","""Son of Paleface"" was my introduction to Jane Russell, who really burns up the screen in her role as the saloon girl/outlaw leader - and it's a great Bob Hope flick too. A worthy sequel to ""The Paleface"", it pairs Hope with Russell and the duo of Roy Rogers (a good straight man who ends up as the third point in the movie's love triangle) and Trigger. Lots of music - including a reprise of the Oscar-winner ""Buttons and Bows"" - and sight gags!"
3,Great western spoof!,"This western spoof starring the comic legend Bob Hope,pretty Jane Russell and the King of the Cowboys Roy Rogers is excellent humor for the family.Directed by a former cartoonist,it is full of cartoon gags!"
1,Cheap build,"Very cool looking tool, but I broke it twice the 1st time I used it. I was pushing a pin from a campy chain and part of the support broke off where the chain is held. I had to push another pin so I used second set of ""teeth"", this broke as well. I ended up using my compact chain tool without any problems. But would not buy secondary to durability issues."
3,It's much bigger and heavier than it looks in the picture,At least that's what I felt. I was hoping I could wear it casually but I can't because it's so bulky.
2,Metal Bleach Necklace,"I quickly received this from the seller, I was disappointed in how small the chain is. Around my little 13 year old brothers neck it nearly chokes him. Also wanted to say the chain itself is made of some weird kind of metal feels very flimsy and not very durable despite its weight.Other than that only Pro is that it looks cool.."
4,"Very good, but I am not sure great","Hartman's voice is undoubtedly sumptuous and beautiful. I withheld a starbecause I felt that it was a voice admiring itself more than conveying themeaning of the song. I felt all the songs on the album were approachedin the similar way. I think a voice with a bit more bite and less predictabilitywould mesh better with the searching and spontaneous Coltrane. Overallthough, I liked it."
2,Not a fan,"I was really excited to read this book because it had amazing reviews. And I'm a big fan of romantic suspense novels. However, I was very disappointed with this book. My main criticism is that the story moved veeeeerrry slowly. I loved the concept of this ""deb"" making something of herself and trying to join the CIA, but it just wasn't exciting. Even when the book got into the ""mission"" part, there's was no action or excitement. It was all gathering intel, reconnoitering with their backup, etc. Another drawback to the story was that the romance was practically nonexistant. You get a feeling from the heroine that she is attracted to the hero, but see nothing reciprocated. And then all of a sudden, they fall into each other's arms. What?? I felt like, what did I miss? I'm sorry to be the only negative review for this book, but I felt it had to be said. The story did pickup a little toward the end, but it was like pulling teeth to get through the first 2/3 of the book."
2,NOT Waterproof - Poorer construction than others.,"What you don't find out until you get the package is this holder is not waterproof. Really would have liked to have known that before I bought it.Edit 3/24/10I bought 2 other brands this week. Can't name them in reviews, but both are tough enough not to flex when pushed with your thumb, one could be stood on. Both have steel pins built into both the hinge and the clasp, and do not rely on plastic being bent over and over and over as a structural part. Both of them will stay not only floating in water, but held under water for 10-15 minutes with no leakage.Good luck to those that did not think my original review mentioning water proofing as being important. Please let us all know how much 4 CF cards are worth once they are water soaked. (And how the pictures came out!)"
5,Great case for a professional.,"Didn't want to splurge for the Pelican case, so I got this one. I don't think it's too big at all. Fits perfectly in my hand or a back pocket. Very happy with it: Sturdy, latch feels secure and it holds the cards securely. I wouldn't want to drop it in water, but I wouldn't worry if it got rained on a little. Overall, great product for my professional use. I would recommend it to anyone. I posted several photos in the product photo area above."
5,Great little case,"This is a great little case for my CF cards. I like the rubbery material the inside is made out of. I think it protects my cards well. If I ever have the need for more cases, I will buy more of these!"
5,Form follows function,"I used this case to hold memory cards in my pro camera case. It does the job nicely. Fits in my jacket pocket (for weddings) or vest when I'm in the field. Also, I like the fact that it's a bright color; shows up in the black hole of camera bags!"
4,Solid case.....,"This case is among the best I've seen. The best part is the rubber compound that is the ""lining"" of the case--this compound holds in the cards quite securely. You can use the case to hold 4 CF cards or 2 CF cards and 1 PCMCIA adaptor card.The main problem I have with this case is that it is not waterproof, something that should be a feature for its pricepoint. Either a rubber or EPDM gasket should be added, or the price should come down.All in all though, a good CF card case."
1,Waste of MONEY,"Charger worked for less than 30 minutes. Not worth the time and trouble of ordering. First time I've ordered, may be my last."
2,false advertising,In the description it said charter cable it doesn't work with charter cable I have no idea why you would say it does if it doesn't don't know if it works good or not maybe some day I will have a compatible cable service .....very poor description
4,"Good, but kind of plodding along....","I think this book was very good, but not quite as good as the Annes&Emilys, althought Montgomery confesses she acts more like herself in Pat Silver Bush. Patricia Gardiner her given name, is interesting, but not like Anne is. And yes, indeed, Judy is funny. But this book just doesn't quite have the charm and imagination and fun read as Anne. I suggest that you read the Anne and Emily's first, then please read Pat of Silver Bush, though it really is Stellar for Montgomery's later work :-)"
1,the history of Armenian genocide. V.N. Dadrian,"I found it very baised toward to his own background nation. he implements that Armenians are Crafty and peace loving people. He never mentions in 1840 city of Maras, Ottoman military outpost, 400 Officer and solders taken prisoners by 5000 armenian mob and their ears and noses cut off and tortured to deadth (Before 1878-1894-1896-and so on.) City of Van murderings before July 10 1915- And after Russion armies invation of Eastern provinces. Never mensions killing their own patriach in Istanbul , cause he did not agree with dashnac organization. Could be a very good book if he was objective. Unfortunatly failed."
1,The Author used Forgeries!,"The author Vahakn Dadrian (who is clearly biased because he is an Armenian nationalist and receives grants from the Armenian government) has used the forgeries called the Aram Andonian (an Armenian's forgeries) documents. These forgeries were used throughout the book to prove a thesis that the Ottoman Turks who allowed religious freedoms and minority rights to the Armenians were somehow evil masterminds comparable to the Nazis--this is absurd. His work is not scholarly; it is filled with propaganda, deceit, unverifiable information, and references to KNOWN forgeries. Anyone who buys the book is wasting their money and time by a grumpy nationalist."
4,Duffle Review,The items that I had purchased were made of the same material as the older duffle bags. They appear to be able to last just as long. The company that I had purchased them from was very quick on thier response when shipping it to a forward deployed location.
5,Will The Real Women Please Stand Up,"I read the hard cover about 3 years ago, so after reading it I gave it to my wife. Boy what a change it has made in my life and my wife's life. We have learned to communicate instaed of shout at one another. I've tried to be more passionate and loving with my wife since I've red this book. It has opened my eyes to how valuable communication is in a loving relationship. Until I read this bnook I always just let things in my relationship work themselves out. I now know that many of my problems could have been avoided if I had only communictaed in an open, honest and loving way. Thanks to Ella Patterson and her will to write a book like this, I am now a happier man, husband and father. I recommend this book to all couples. It's not just a book for women it's for men too. I don't know Ella personally, but If she ever reads this review I just want to say Thanks to her for helping to save my marriage. I am a better man because of her."
4,A solid work by Fastball,"If you're looking for any retread of ""The Way"", once again: Don't expect it. Do expect, however, a well crafted CD filled with melodious pop songs ranging from soft to slightly rough-edged, each with unmistakeably catchy hooks and excellent song structure. The trade-offs of lead vocal credit between songs between Tony Scalzo and Miles Zuniga provides yet another injection of variety into an already excellent album. Aside from the single ""You're an Ocean"", the most stand-out tracks are ""Morning Star"" and ""Love is Expensive and Free"", perhaps one of the most to-the-point and true-to-life songs written on that subject I've heard in a while. And back to lead vocals, I tend to lean towards Tony Scalzo as the better of the two, but to each his own. You won't be disappointed with this album. Fastball does what they do better than any band out there in this day and age, and 3 albums into the game, they are strong as ever."
4,This is NOT Fastballs best.,"It seems so many reviewers think ""The Harsh Light of Day"" is so much better than all their other albums. Its an excellent collection of vintage sounding pop songs, but it doesnt come near as good as their Sophmore release ""All the Pain Money can Buy"". Whereas on ATPMCB every song was amazing and melodic, I somtimes find myself skipping tracks on the new release. On the upside their are the good songs like the super upbeat ""Your and Ocean"", with some great Southern piano by none other than Billy ""Get Back"" Preston. Also there is ""This is not my Life"", ""Love is Expensive and Free"", and ""Funny How it Fades Away."" The collectors edition features a pretty dull live version of ""The Way"" , but the two unreleased tracks will definitely get your foot tapping. It also features a cool book."
4,Great.,"To be honest I didn't like this cd when I first listened to it. But, it grew on me and now I cant stop listening to it. Heavy, yet melodic Uneath is an amazing band. Adam D's production work is amazing as usual.Favs: Zombie Autopilot, Great Divide, Lie to Purify"
4,Blew most of the competition away this year.,"With Inflames, Killswitch, Shadows Fall, The Haunted, Lamb Of God, and Cradle Of filth all releasing new stuff this year it was gonna be tough to make your amrk, but this album slays most of the Competition. Black Hearts Now Reign, Zombie Autopilot, BLood Lust of the Human Condition , Endless, and Predetermined sky are the best tracks but all are grea examples of some of the best metal and hardcore mixing this side of STORMTROOPERS OF DEATH."
1,So mediocre it kills,"Whats the diffrence between this and Killswitch Engage? Not much, as you thought. No mattter what other people say, this sounds just like all the other generic metalcore bands (Trivium, Chimaira, God Forbid, etc.)Want good New Wave bands? Mastodon, Lamb of God, and Thine Eyes Bleed. Otherwise, avoid this band until they can devolope a sound thats unique."
1,Uhhh... No...,"Hmmm, what is this ? Unearth is terrible and i dont see why people find their music, good or even interesting? Its generic,unoriginal, horrible riffs and you kno what? it's not even heavy. If your into mainstream crap then buy this but for people that can apreciate better music? Look else where !"
2,you can do better. alot better,"This band is pretty much a joke, ive seen them live and all they do is dance around and tell the crowd to do the same. Not only this but hteyre music is not that great, you'd be much better of getting Killswitch Engage if your a fan of this kind of metalcore"
4,great,"Unearth is an awsome hxc band. They have gret guitaring and drumming. The songs are a good mix of metal and hardcore. If you like as i lay dying, norma jean, my children my bride, you'll probaly like this. In my opinion the best song is ""The Great Dividers"" or ""endless"". For any fan of metal or hardcore or both, this would be an excellent album for you to own/"
4,Good album from a usually stagnant genre,"For the most part I can't stand hardcore/metalcore. Unearth is some good stuff, though. There are some who absolutely despise metalcore, and this may or may not change their minds. However, if you even remotely enjoy metalcore, then this album is essential.I was already to give this album five stars, but then I realized I was making the same mistake a lot of reviewers were making. I was crediting this as an overall from start to finish fantastic album. In actaulity, most of the album is quite good but I was so in love with a few choice tracks that it blinded my judgement. Another reviewer said it best when they said that this album lacks depth. It really fizzls out in the second half. I usually find myself listening to about the half album's worth of standout tracks before putting in a different CD.This maybe should only get 3.5, but I will round up due to the great musicmanship in a genre that I usually detest. Definately worth the money."
5,"i didn't wanna, but i gotta....","alright. this guy makes a few good points. it IS good. Unearth ARE talented...but the buck stops there. everything else is WRONG. unlike chimaira...unearth is a good band. and unearth is not influenced by Chimaira at all either...smalls, you're killing me here...seriously, dude...no. just simply, no. and to recommend The Oncoming Storm to serious metal fans and not casual metalcore fans is ludicrous...who the hell will buy it if not casual metalcore fans??? the real metalheads will complain it's not metallica or pantera...metalcore kids will like the breakdowns and the screaming and such...this was probably, along with Bury Your Dead's cover your tracks, the best metalcore cd to drop last year, fo sho. choosing standout tracks i'd say #1, 3, 5,...the whole damn cd. it was good, Unearth is good...get their other cds too, and forget what that guy said...don't let a Chimaira comparison stop you from getting a good cd...i hate Chimaira...this is metal."
4,4 1/2 stars,"About a month ago I decided to purchase the new Killswitch Engage album. I had never really been that much into them but I thought they had good potential from what I had heard of them. WEll, I was seriously disapointed with the lead singer and how all they felt all their songs needed to have a p-ssy sounding chorus.Well a month later, I purchased this cd, and I can this is the cd I was looking for! I got great, heavy, Gothenberg(loosely) riffs, with amazing drums and breakdowns that make you want to get crazy. And surprise! I don't have some black dude giving his best Clay Aiken impression about 1:30 into each song!So basically, if you think KSE is cool but you get sick of all the wuss singing, you'll love this. Didn't give it 5 stars because the middle gets somewhat monotonous...but overall probably the best metal cd i've bought in awhile."
5,Unearth for the ages,"It's 2012 which would make this album 8 years old to date an as a metal head I'm still headbanging to black hearts still reign,Zombie autopilot everything on this album is pure gold. The great thing about unearth they kept the same brash sound all these years an haven't changed. If you need something that will wake you up an get moving pop in unearth"
2,"Oh boy, where to start...","I've recently been going on a cd purchasing spree. If something catches my attention, I'll give it a whirl. So far, I've been pretty satisfied and proud of myself for the purchases I've made. Until I hit this snag. Another reviewer has said exactly what I've been saying for so long. This is unoriginal dribble. It fits so snug into the current trend of metalcore in America that I turned it off after two songs. I could throw this into a pile of As I Lay Dying, August Burns Red, Between the Buried and Me, Shadows Fall, Trivium, or any other current Ozzfest darling and never be able to tell the difference. And being in a band myself who has played with August Burns Red and BTBAM, I can tell you there is truly nothing new going on. Avoid this and get something with some balls."
1,I give this band and this trend 2 years and they are gone.,"Eh... i suffered 7 years old nu metal, 5 years of alternative, and now its metalcores turn.I give this imitation ""death/swedish/black/thrash"" rip off a couple years.What you people say about limp bizkit is what you will say about all these crappy bands.""OMG remember limp bizkit? they sucked and i used to like them""That's todayYou in 2007?""omg remember those gay emo bands, yeah i thought they were heavy but now i realize they sucked"""
1,STALE GENERIC NONSENSICAL BORING CLICHE,THIS IS MUSIC FOR LOSERS WHO TAKE STEROIDS AND LIKE TO ACT TOUGH BUT REALLY CRY AT NIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO INSECURE!
4,One of the best new bands to emerge in the past few years,"With all the bands getting noticed in this current rise of the ""metalcore"" genre in the metal world, Unearth is definitely one of the best. ""Oncoming Storm"" finds Unearth blending old school metal vibes with hardcore music, and they do it better than almost anyone else. The seven string double guitar assault works so well here for the most part, that you can't help but not admire the talent of these guys, and standout tracks include ""Failure"", ""Black Hearts Now Reign"", and ""Zombie Autopilot"" are prime examples of this. The only real problem with ""Oncoming Storm"" is that it loses steam and wears thin as it progresses, which is something that has been plaguing recent metal releases over the past year or two, but other than that, this is a winner. All in all, Unearth's ""Oncoming Storm"" is one of the best releases with the recent ""metalcore"" storm of late, and old school metal heads who haven't heard them may want to check this out."
4,IN YOUR FACE METAL!,"this is the second really good metal band I have reviewed today, the other one being All That Remains. After listening to this album I can say that this is no-frills in-your-face metal, and it fu*king rocks! Perfect for when you get tired of emo charged nu-meal ticket rock and the bad musicianship that goes with it. And the lyrics probably make the little emo kids pi** in their pants. We need more bands like this to squash out all of the radio metal music being played everywhere!"
4,Metalcore Album of 2004.,"UNEARTH - The Oncoming Storm-Honestly this album is nothing new BUT, it kicks serious ass. This is one of my favorite Albums of 2004. This is ""the"" Metalcore album. Musicianship on this CD is incredible. The 7-String Guitar work is some of finest... The Bass is well done, the Drum work is great, and the Vocals are perfect for this style of music. As stated before this album really isn't anything ""New"" but there is Talent, Creative song writing, And some great songs... It may not quite be Dillinger's - Miss Machine or Mastodon's - Leviathan but it stands tall amongst many other albums in 2004. Also in a scene over credited to Killswitch Engage I'd gladly hand the Metalcore throne of 2004 to Unearth's - Oncoming Storm.Favorite Songs: Failure, Black Hearts Now Reign, Endless4.25 - STARSIF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:""Was this review helpful?"""
3,not all its cracked up to be,"First of all I am an unearth fan, and have been for some time. The reason I gave this album only 3 stars is because this is by no means a perfect album nor an above effort for UNEARTH. After the last ep endless I was expecting something ground breaking but this album left me wanting more. They put the endless track on this album also and in my opinion is still the best track. This band has all the potential in the world and just didn't live up to it on this release. They showed no amount of maturity on The OnComing Storm, except for the instrumential track which kills any momentum the record had created. It was well worth the 9.99 I spent on it, but this album is by no means ""the best metal/hardcore record of the year""."
5,Aint talkin bout' love,"With its main sample taken from the classic Van Halen track ""Aint Taklin Bout Love"" (ala Apollo 440), this song hits hard and leaves you wanting more. Not much of a club staple, but it should be. A great buy for those into the genre."
3,Under Heavy Criticizm,"Atmittedly, Van Dien may have been a bad choice for this film, but he doesn't do a terrible job. Just not that good. The amazing thing about this film which most reviewers seem to have missed is that a lot of it seems to have actually been filmed in Vietnam. It is also the first film to approach the subject of Veterans returning to Nam. On that note, the acting was pretty bad, quite overdone and just plain laughable at times, and the dialogue was pretty lame. The action was mediocre at best, and all the actors, the ""vietnam veterans"" who are revisiting Nam are clearly in their 20's and 30's. The subplots were unnecessary, and several of the dates were extremely innacurate. If you have any intrest in Vienam films, and war films in general, this film is worth at least one watch. Even better, watch Sindey Furie's other film ""The Boys of Company C""."
1,Under Heavy Sedation,"Under the guise of being a movie about healing of Vietnam War Veterans this movie is just the opposite. In the movie these old soldiers get together and find out what trigger happy baby killers they were when they were young. Apparently there are still folks out there that find it neccessary to keep on spitting on vets. I picked up this DVD cheap and kind of sorry that I spent the six bucks for it. If you want to see a good Vietnam flick, spend your money on WHEN WE WERE SOLDIERS. It is a much better storyline and the folks in it actually do a good job of acting. UNDER HEAVY FIRE on the other hand is a B movie, with a lousy story and poorly executed. Sappy-sappy-sappy with a big group hug in the end. What a waste. Why do I have to give this move a star. Why can't I give it a minus three stars?"
1,The worst vietnam movie ever!!!!!!!!,"I rented this trash thinking it would be good. I've seen the directors other film""Boys of company C"", and it was great. But this movie is done w/cheap recording, crappy acting, and a stupid ending. By far the worst vietnam movie i've ever seen."
5,Grandchildren love it!,"I bought this and all three of my grandchildren at various times grab it and ride on it every time they visit. They also watch TV while on it or just sit on it when they are visiting with family members. I just leave it in the living room now, instead of carrying it up and down the stairs. It's cute and survives even the larger children rocking on it."
4,100% pure european club music,"In CD#1 you shall find excelent house music and in the CD#2 the best trance in the world. This CD is really worth it, you will find songs that will be club hits in 2002."
2,Not worth the money!,"Here are a few problems with this stroller:*it's heavy*the seat is uncomfortable for your baby*the safety harness/straps are very flimsy and cheaply made and a pain*the stroller is very wide set so you will not fit through isles in stores, not good for the mall or shopping!*no cup holder or tray for baby*basket underneath is good sized but short so taller items will fall out!I got rid of this stroller-it looks like a bugaboo but is so darn wide that I would bump into everything!It does have a nice smooth ride and is easy to maneuver but that it about the only positive thing I can say!"
4,"Wry, Humourous, with only a few minor flaws.","I enjoyed _Naked Came The Sasquatch_ very much. It is a veryentertaining book, which, despite a grammatically awkwardfirst chapter, manages to captivate the reader. The characters are very well done; they are realistic, and come alive during the course of the book. The writing is wry, and the book maintains a humourous tone throughout, despite a rather grisly subject matter. The genre can only be described as Humourous-Scary-Exciting-not quite horror, but not quite anything else."
1,Glasses are heavy and look nice but have ansightly seam in them.,The glasses have a very prominent seam that is unatractive. Glasses should not have an unsightly seam don the entire side.
1,Broken Upon Delivery,Sent these glasses as a gift about a month ago. Just learned the other day that three of the glasses were received broken. Other reviews say the same thing. You would think they would learn how to properly package a product.
4,Decent glasses,"These are nice, heavy glasses. The only drawback I can find is the cavity in the underside of the glass that retains water in the dishwasher. I recently opened a cabinet door only to have one of the short glasses fall from about 5 feet, striking the vinyl floor and bouncing onto the hardwood floor of the adjacent dining room. Not a scratch on that glass! I couldn't believe it and certainly won't guarantee that kind of durability. I'd buy them again."
4,I don't see Matthau as a pirate eating a Fishhook every day,"Captain Red and his Young Slave The Frog, Two Stranded Pirates on-board an Drifting raft, Are rescued by A passing Pirate ship, Only to find it's cargo is ruled by a Aztec golden throne. Which leads to an Pirate Comedy battle to steel the Throne."
3,Used VHS Movie: Pirates,Arrived very promptly. Movie was in only fair condition. Picture quality a bit muddled and pasty probably due to age and wear; but probably as good as could be expected from a well-used VHS tape.
5,One of Polanski's Most Underrated Films,"Pirates is one of Roman Polanski's most underrated films along with The Fearless Vampire Killers and the Tenant. While the latter two films are masterpieces, Pirates is a very good pirate film that's never received it's due.Polanski redefines the pirate film while still paying tribute to the swashbuckling genre. This film is the perfect companion piece to The Fearless Vampire Killers. Walter Matthau gives an excellent performance as the fearless Captain Red and the rest of the cast's performances hit all the right notes. Polanski's direction is masterful as always. The photography and musical score are also very good. From a purely technical standpoint this film is excellent. The script is really the only thing that keeps this film from attaining greatness.MGM who now hold the DVD rights (they now own the rights to the entire Cannon film library) must release this film as soon as possible in it's uncut, 124 minute widescreen glory (I suggest emailing MGM)."
2,Great product: Poor Milleages,"I own three cars and all equiped with the K@N filter. My new car is a 2012 VW passat 2.5 did not notice anything perfomance wice, however i bought this filter because is more air going to the engine. I notice that my miles per gallon had decrease i get 4 miles les per galon at highway. I travel myself and i test is on the same highway several times but miles per galon did not got any better."
2,No difference from stock filter,"I bought this for my 2008 VW Rabbit, hoping to get some sort of performance or efficiency bump. The result was nothing different from stock.Fuel economy is the same, performance feels the same.The only open question is whether this has a longer life than a stock filter. If so, it might justify the cost. Otherwise, it's not worth it."
4,Diabetes Friendly,"I thought I would never eat ribs with BBQ sauce again until I stumbled on this stuff...great flavor, nice and thick. The best part...no negative impact on my blood sugar readings! Am looking forward to more ribs in my future!"
4,Would eat it even if I wasn't looking for low carb....,"This sauce is phenomenal. It is not runny or overly vinegary (like most low carb sauces). It clings to the meat very well. And a little goes a long way. Personally, I prefer to cook the meat with a good rub and finish off in the last few minutes with Smokin' Joe Jone's low carb sauce."
4,EXCELLENT!,"This is the best no sugar, low carb bbq sauce ever! I took away one star because the shipping is so expensive!"
2,Nutrition Information Please,"I haven't actually tried this product yet (I'm getting ready to), but I am concerned that Amazon doesn't seem to offer a breakdown on the nutritional information. I do low carb and this is very important. Amazon offers many lc products, but I do not see this information on any of them. Makes it harder to order."
3,"Decent, nothing Spectacular","A decent mix of trance tracks but nothing extraordinary. The album starts out with a couple of tunes that I consider ideal trance music, mellow, a good beat, and great background music. Def by Stereo by Echoplex is what I consider dance, not trance, though the lines between the genres are admittedly blurred. This song has a strong thumping beat and is not relaxing or trance-like in any way. A few of the other tunes include some vocals, most notably on The Sun by Drax and Scott Mac and Change by Sunscream. These are decent songs and can be great to listen to in the car, but they're not excellent dance songs and not mellow enough to listen to as background music while you're working on something else."
2,Make sure it's leather,"I've bought the Predator Absolion TRXFG before and it is a great shoe. However, in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper -- and the pair I received yesterday (blue with red and silver) is synthetic. Make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price, you receive a leather shoe! You are not ""saving $50"" if it's synthetic."
4,"Excellent shoes, buy the one on Sale","I had a huge delimna on purchasing a new pair of soccer shoes. I tried the Nike ZoomAir ( Synthetic) and got humongous blisters on my achiles and toe. Due to the blisters, I couldn't play for a while. Then someone told me to try Leather shoes instead of Synthetic. I did some research and found out that:Adididas Predator has the best reviews. Also, one of my friends had it and was very content with them. Preditor has 3 models: Absolute ( most expensive), Absolion ( mig range shoes, modest price) and their lower end ( can't remember its name).Absolion was a good choice. I bought the black/yellow on on sale for 49.99 and couldn't be happier. I am back playing and very happy with its performance and price."
5,Always So Inventive.,"Mclaughlin is the one guy that if you had to pick someone, is responsible for the revolution in jAZZ guitar playing! great album! also cool, is a guy I just discovered at ... check it out it'll calm and excite you simultaneously!"
5,remarkable.,"No need to make this review long-winded. This album contains a gentle mood of soulfullness like no other I have experienced. It is a just plain beautiful extroadinary fantastic delicate album...Listen to ""Arjen's Bag"" on a cold winter day... it is remarkable."
1,Why Bother,"Question...why make an un-mixed DJ friendly compilation album then chop the uttercrap out of most of the songs. Bought this disc as i needed Spooks-Feel Up for a set.The trk is 7:05mins long.So the disc arrives and i take a listen to the song i,m after. Only to find some genius has cut the track in half to a whopping 3:15mins...the trk takes that long to warm up for gods sake.Just as the track gets rolling...wham!...lets do a fade out and edit this track so badly i don,t why they even bothered putting it on the cd...absolute garbage and a waste of my time and money. Especially when this is the only disc available where this track comes un-mixed.*insert expletive of choice here.*If you,re just buying this disc to listen to..okay. But be warned that in the name of jamming 17tracks on to one disc,you,re getting alot of jipped,edited tracks.DJ,s stay right away. They would of been better of hiring a dj and having the disc mixed."
2,"Looks good, however . . .","I received the product, and it looks great. However, I needed to be able to store it in my 4 inch RV bumper, along with the waste hose. It will not fit in our standard 4 inch square bumper (even without the hose attached); so, I can't use it. If one has a larger storage area, the product appears to be very durable.I then bought the RhinoFlex hose kit, which has a clear section in it. It works great and fits in the RV bumper."
1,Beautiful...if you like orange.,"I have had these for about 4 months (I own every size made), purchased to go with the other Kitchenaid pieces (in red). It is impossible to get these white again after using them to cut cheese, carrots or anything with any natural coloring in it. I have tried cleansers with bleach, sprays with bleach and, in desperation, straight bleach! Scrubbing doesn't work either. I finally got some wood cutting boards and wish I still had my so attractive other ones on the counter."
4,Reminds me of the battle we fight...,"This book showed me how ""our battle is not against flesh and blood"". God spoke to B. Sheikh in incredible ways, which we sometimes find ""spooky"" or unbelievable. But, her testimony of how she came to faith reminds me that God works in the supernatural realm, conquering the spirit and occult world. God will overcome ""the powers of this dark world"" and ""the spiritual forces of evil"" and bring peace, just as he did in the author's life."
3,I dared to call him father,"In light of the ongoing involvement in the middle east, this book was informative to those who have an interest in the customs and beliefs in this part of the world. The writing style is easy to read and holds the readers attention."
3,god works in ********** ways,"i have read this book.It seems to me that the author is sincere in her damascus experience. however if she had looked into her own faith further she would have found the inner light she was seeking in sufism. I dont doubt her faith,for only the creator judges,but modern research only continues to confirm that the holy quran is the final book of thr creator to mankind for guidance.(See The bible,quran and modern science by Dr Maurice Bucaille)"
2,bond's not here,"The return of Sean Connery in a humorist mood is odd after 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. This is the simplest Bond film. It is not as exciting, but it is entertaining and fun to watch Bond's world of menace, terror, humour and sex. Look out for the sadistic scene, where Bond gets thrown around by Bambi and Thumper! Also the character of Willard White, the rich, vegas eccentric, is a hoot! At this point I'm tired of Connery because he doesn't seem to be in the game anymore and his performance is uninspired. And the script is too simplistic, like the coda at the end when Bond and Case the female heroine rid of the remaining villains, it's small-minded and not effective. But the film transfer, yet again is superb!"
3,diamonds are forever,It is a nice movie performed by sean connery.Despite being an old film there is technology that has paved way for strides in todays science
1,What a Disappointing follow up...,"...to the best of the Bond movies. Connery is back and that's about it.How in the world do you make OHMSS and then make this! What an insult! They don't even make any reference to the fact that he's after Blofeld because he killed Bond's wife. The whole story is stupid and the characters are dumb. It's Bond against three queers. This movie gave Roger Boore his ""Licence to Kill Audiences"" with his sophmoric humor in his horrible films. I rate this as the worst in the series; there are probably worse ones by Roger but because it was Sean in the role, I say shame on you! He knows better than this of how to portray 007. By the way Connery looked better 12 yrs. later when he did Warner Bros. ""Never Say Never Again"" I have to stop because I'm getting aggravated."
5,James Bond Action Is Forever...,5 stars are not enough for this great movie... Plenty of action! Sean Connery is great. Lots of special effects and Bond Girls... The DVD edition seams to be good with great stuff and quality.
4,"The return of the original Bond, older but wiser",Sean Connery was lured back to the role that made a star nearly ten years earlier. The wittier style of Diamonds are forever would later be repeated in the Roger Moore films that followed. Connery may not look as youthful as he did in previous Bond films but is good to have the original and best James Bond back. I found Diamonds hugely enjoyable with great villians Mr. Wint and Mr. Kint and Bond girl Tiffany Case but I did not think Charles Gray was the best Blofeld and the question I always wonder is 'Is Blofeld working indepentently or on behalf of Spectre ( who never get a mention in the film). Beside that you will find Diamonds are Forever great entertainment.
3,"""James! There's more to you than I imagined.""","Jill St. John may have been referring to Bond's increasingwaistline, but that's okay because this is an entertaining,if uneven 007 outing. True, there are long periods where Bond is not on the scene, but a couple of comical but deadlyvillians take up the slack there. The last third of themovie slows to an unimaginative end action piece, but the lastaction on the ship is lively enough.The Las Vegas scenes are fun. And look at that completelyopen from ceiling to floor casino at the Circus-Circushotel. After the movie was make the owners put in a secondfloor deviding the circus acts from the casino. It seemsthe gamblers stopped placing bets when the shows went on.The title song by Shirley Bassey is one of the best of thethe series. And I've been a fan of Jill St. John since""The Lost World"" (1959). So this film entertained me enoughat least for a couple of viewings. It isn't the best, butit's Sean, and it's Bond."
5,"Diamonds are forever .... James Bond is, too!","The title of this James Bond adventure could well be the eternal ""credo"" for Sean Connery as James Bond .... his outstanding work as the suave, sophisticated, action-biased, reckless and seemingly indestructible superagent continues to grow better with age. A great film and one that will be a fan-favorite!"
4,Connery and Hamilton return with one of the better Bond movies.,"When George Lazenby turned down the offer to continue as James Bond, Sean Connery was brought back for one last movie before Roger Moore took over. They also brought back ""Goldfinger"" director Guy Hamilton. ""Diamonds Are Forever"" is set mostly in Las Vegas and Bond once again fights Blofeld (this time played by Charles Gray). The running time is back at an even two hours, and it doesn't suffer from an uneven pace as ""Thunderball"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" did. The story is good and the movie has two of the Bond series' best henchmen, Mr Kidd and Mr Wint. In my opinion, this is one of the best Bond movies after ""Goldfinger"" and before ""The Spy Who Loved Me""."
3,1st Class Production marred by Flabby Script,"And the script isn't the only thing that's gone flabby. Though only forty at the time Diamonds was shot, Connery looks a good ten years older. Tired, flabby and sporting bushy eyebrows and long sideburns, Connery was beginning to look like he was following in Elvis' 70's-era footsteps. Ironically, Connery's next Bond appearance (though not an ""official one"") in ""Never Say Never Again"" came a full twelve years later and found him looking in much better shape.Thankfully, Connery does give a good--even funny--return performance. Kudos also to a typically 1st class production and Shirley Bassey title song. Dragging things back down are a comic book script and an extremely irritating Jill St. John."
3,CONNERY CAN STILL PLAY IT TO THE HILT,"Some may argue that this movie is connerys worst I would probley for the most part say they are right. But worst is a bad word. I think this is his 6th place finnisher in his offical bonds. I liked the humour in this one. I think they brought it out more like moore did in his bonds. The Blofeld in this one is a little to nice in this one thou. The main female lead, Tiff Case was great the first half, but at the end she turns into a weak character. The 2 gay henchman, thou very strage to watch, actully did there parts very well in this movie. Connery proved he can still kick it with this role. The plot is ok, just not the best. I think Willard White's role in this movie was a little out of place also. But all in all, a great bond movie which should satisfy most bond fans."
2,Sean Connery WAS James Bond,Diamonds Are Forever (1971)-Sean Connery looks like he should be trying to unload a parking lot full of `67 Chevrolets; the actor playing Felix Leiter looks even dumpier. Jill St. John as Tiffany Case ranks among the more irritating heroines. The penny-whistle sound effect completely trivializes the nifty 360-degree rotation car jump across the river. Even Shirley Bassey's voice can't rescue this one. 5/10
3,Fun Connery Bond,"""Diamonds Are Forever"" is the most comedic Connery Bond adventure. This is Connery's first time back as 007 after a one picture break. While not the best of 007, it is certainly fun to see the best Bond fight S.P.E.C.T.R.E. one last time (not counting ""Never Say Never Again"").There are some problems though. While ""Diamonds"" is very lighthearted and funny, it doesn't pay much respect to the 007 myth. In the Bond film previous to this; ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", 007 suffered a great emotional loss by Blofeld. In this film the stakes should have been raised higher and the tone much more dark.Still, ""Diamonds Are Forever"" is fun for true 007 fans."
4,Irresistable,"It's a guilty pleasure... miserably directed, filled with unattractive performances, and with a dud script that's especially painful after ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" And yet it's hard to resist. Even paunchy, beat-out and sporting a bad toupee, Sean Connery is a magnetic actor, and he has a wonderful moment when he's introduced to a girl who says ""Hello. I'm Plenty"": ""but of course you are,"" he coos. Jill St. John is one of the more memorable Bond girls, the title song is a sleazy masterpiece, and the chases feature a cool red Mustang and a clumsy Moon Buggy. Is it a good movie? Irrelevant, Mr. Bond!"
1,It's all about the money,"Connery was at his absolute worst in this film. They had to pay him a high amount to do it, then he only reluctantly agreed. Jill St. John was a horrible bond girl. Her lines were garbage and all she did was mess things up. She could have at least been good looking. The actor who portrayed the villain was an ally in You Only Live twice. What kind of casting is this? Connery should have done his last official movie in 1969 in OHMSS which would have been fantastic with his acting ability. Nobody's acting in this was inspired. If somebody had told me that the movie was 3-1/2 hours long I would have believed them. The movie was supposed to be fun, but I felt myself yawning a lot more than laughing. If you want to see a ""fun"" Bond movie, check out Live and Let Die or The Man with the Golden Gun. At least I laughed twice in those movies. Definitely Connery's worst outing. Actually I think this is the worst Bond movie ever. period."
4,Classic Bond,"Great chase scene through old Vegas and the Casino gambling. Also, the circus acts in Circus, Circus. Been there and seen it."
2,Meanders,It's really hard to say what the point was here.The movie starts out meandering and never quits. Many questions are left unanswered and ambiguous. Was that intentional?Are the mafia people here good guys or bad guys?Which Blofeld is real?Does it really matter?Did Sean Connery have to lose weight for this part?And then there's Plenty O'Toole...Let's hope they never remake this one.
5,The best James Bond-film ever made!!!,This movie is the best James Bond-film I have ever seen!!! The music makes the film even better with the wonderful score of John Barry.
5,Connery at his best! Shocking!,"Sean Connery's last Bond film for thirteen years; (Never Say Never Again would be his absolute last Bond film in 1984),Connery, if a little heavier around the waistline, and perhaps slightly more folically challenged is still the Bond to beat! Charles Gray is great as Ernst Stavro Blowfelt, adding more refinement and cynicism to a character previously portrayed by Donald Pleasance (1967's You Only Live Twice). Jill St. John is quite good as diamond smuggling, red head Tiffany Case, and Desmond Llewelynn is, as always, perfect in the role of ""Q"". Now famous Las Vegas chase seen is stuff of legend and righfully so, but look for Mustang to enter alley leaning on right two wheels, and exit alley leaning on opposite two wheels? The locations shots are magnificient, (a Bond trademark) Overall, a fitting salute to, in my opinion, the best actor to ever don the James Bond gear! Truly worth watching."
1,Do buy buy from MY DISCOUNT MEDIA,"Do not by from seller MY DISCOUNT MEDIA. I bought DVD Diamonds are Forever (James Bond) from Seller MY DISCOUNT MEDIA April 2, 2011 and I received through the mail a damaged DVD on April 9th. I filed a claim for a refund uising A-Z guarantee. The Seller contacted me April 12th and said that to please cancel claim and throw away DVD. Futhermore, that they just sent a new replacement DVD. I trusted them so I canceled the claim. Well I never received the replacement DVD. I sent emails to the seller for status of replacement but no response. I just reopened my claim for refund against this Seller using my A-Z guarantee. The positive experience is that I am VERY GLAD I bought this item through Amazon.com having the A-Z guarantee as my assurance."
4,Connerys back and he's done it again!!,"Sean Connery returns to play the role as James Bond in the 7th Bond film of the series which is one of my favourites. Charles Gray plays as Blofeld this time and his acting was suberb. Although some Bond fans think this is one of Connerys worst performance's, I think its filled with excitment which is a reason for this being so good. We see Bond travelling to Holland and Las Vegas to find the villians who have stolen some diamonds and intend to use them to make a satalite that can fire lasers. There are some funny moments and memorable scenes in this film and it is good for the whole family to watch. This film is however let down by some of the cast. I would recommend this film to everyone. Go on, give it a go. Fun all the way through."
2,the weakest of the connery's,"The plot in this film is dull and boring, this film is by far the worst connery film, Lana Wood and Jill St John are two anoying bond girls and Charles gray was the worst blofeld of them all. The best part of the film is the title seqence but thats all there is. If there were any dull films this would be one of them."
2,HUGE Letdown after OHMSS,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service was one of the best Bond movies ever made, and after the extremely sad ending you would think Bond would be infatuated with killing the man that killed his wife. But alas, Connery returns as the calm, sophisticated secret agent, not the murderous man out to exact revenge on the one man he truly hates. This movie has severe problems as Blofeld once again escapes and isn't even brought up again until For Your Eyes Only. As much as I enjoyed the Connery films, Lazenby was truly the right man for this movie."
3,Low-point for Connery's Bond,"As much as I try to like ""Diamonds are forever"", I can't. Connery looks old/tired and the script has him do everything in a sort of go-through-the-motions jest. The musical score is good, Jill St. John is a delight and the ending finally had Bond acting like Bond. Then the movie is over. It seems like the 1970s malaise had settled into the Bond film. When Roger Moore takes over in the thrilling ""Live and Let Die"" the Bond films become fast-paced action adventures with it difficult to deliver a realistic story line. Why Connery and company let ""Diamonds are forever"" drift into self-parody is a mystery to me, this was the whole point of Connery; he was believable and we were watching something that could really happen. My view is the last REAL 007 movie made by Connery was ""You only Live twice""."
4,Connery's farewell,"Connery's last film in the official Bond series is not one of his best, but neither is it one of his worst. Why does Blofeld have hair? That is the big mystery of this movie for me. In my opinion, this is the 4th best official Connery film, worse than Goldfinger, Thunderball, and From Russia With Love but better than Dr. No and You Only Live Twice"
3,"Again, could only give it 3 starts","Where can I begin. This is my least favorite bond films that Connery is in. I did not like Charles Gray playing Blofeld because he was horrible. Telly Savalas and Donald Plesance did a much better job. I feel it was poor casting. Connery looked like he gained more weight and looked a lot heavier than he was on You Only Live Twice. Plus, trying to cover his balding wasn't so good and he was more grayer if you really pay attention throughout the film. Otherwise some of the other characters were corkey, but it is an OK film. I gave it 3 stars because Connery came back in 1971."
1,The Worst Bond !,"This Bond movie is in my opinion the worst one to date, the locations suck (Holland, the US, how exotic), the story line is silly, if you want to have an armageddon plot at least make it believable, like in ""The Spy who loved Me"", the lead woman is not very attractive, rather looks like a cheap slut, Sean Connery appears unmotivated, then you have these disturbing homosexual killers, who are supposed to be funny, but fail like just about everything else in this movie. Don't bother to buy this film."
1,This is supposed to be Bond?,"Diamonds are Forever is a terrible letdown after her OHMSS. I would have given it no stars if it weren't for the fact I love Connery. But he is too OLD. Bushy eyebrows and muttonchops are not for bond. This movie has the worst effects of the series, stupid bond girls, and a HORRIBLE Blofeld. A completely lame plot destroys any likeability. I hope on hope on hope someone will go finish the story OHMSS started."
3,Connery's worst Bond film.....,"Of course after You Only Live Twice, Connery vowed never to return to the Bond franchise. After OHMSS flopped, they pleaded with Connery to make one more film, to reclaim the series' good name. The first half of the film was actually interesting, but then the dirty sex jokes of the early 70s come in. By the end of the film, the budget HAD to have been low. For instance, look for the few explosions at the end of the film that appear in the distance. They look like someone just struck a match!!!! If anything, I would buy this DVD for the bonus features. Moore's first film, Live and Let Die, which followed this film is much better........."
3,"""He certainly left with his tails between his legs.""","Sean Connery's swan song in the Eon series of 007 films takes a Fleming story about gangsters from Las Vegas and diamond smuggling and infuses Blofeld, two gay killers and a ditzy redhead. The grand finale is a fight on an oil rig. A Howard Hughes type character is played the king of pork, Jimmy Dean. A car chase where a Mustang Mach I is driven through an alley on two wheels (the set piece of the film) at the conclusion of a chase through the streets of Vegas that demolishs 28 cars. Entertaining but less typical of the earlier films than the Roger Moore era to come."
3,Connery losing his bond touch,"I mean come on this movie was pretty boring but there was barely even a plot in the flim I mean connery was too old for the part of bond. Jill st John was good and mouthy as the bond girl Tiffany Case and don't get me started with Lana Wood as the other annoying bond girl Plenty o' Toole who was annoying,weird and goregous now she was ordinary. The Villains in this are nothing good but weird and weak because all they do is walk but don't fight and Charles Gray as Blofeld is got to be the weirdest blofeld I ever seen. If you want a bond with more action,adventure and good plot then get live and let die."
3,diamonds doesn't deserve any more than 3!,"I'll keep this brief: after being entranced with this film for the first hour and a half, I was so utterly disappointed with the ending, I vowed never to watch this film again! Not only is it slow and unimaginative, but unclimactic and downright not enjoyable to watch! If the climax of this film was improved I would call this the best film of the Bond series!!!"
4,Great Bond adventure,"This was Sean Connery's comeback as Bond after George Lazenby's appearance in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" 1969, and before Roger Moore took over in 1973 (""Live and Let Die"").It has a great comic book-like plot involving diamond smuggling, casinos, super weapons, assassins and Bond's arch-nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Charles Gray is good as the villain and the [dumb] assassins, Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are among the best Bond characters ever.This is probably one of the best Bond movies. It's very entertaining, a must have for all Bond fans."
2,"Some interesting stuff, but not for me.","Unfortunately, I found this book had as much to do with Bill Bissonnette as it had to do with the revival, and it almost could have been titled ""The Bill Bissonnette Story."" Readers should also note that Jazz Crusade is also the name of Bissonnette's own record production company and that the book appears to be published by a ""vanity press"" of sorts: Special Request Books.With that said, Bissonnette does have a few interesting stories to tell, but the fact that he is a musician and not a writer becomes quickly apparent. The CD is decent, but it doubles the price of the package."
1,GIVE ME A BREAK!,"We're used to the 1960s being given unjustifiable credit for everything from toast to angel's wings, but this is ridiculous! The great New Orleans jazz revival began in the late 1930s with Blue Note Records, and had peaked by the late 1950s. The 1960s had NOTHING to do with it, even though a small band of enthusiasts continued to worship the style, stultifying it in the process. Zero stars, if it were possible"
2,TOO SMALL PRINT: Living My Life by Emma Goldman,"I was looking forward to reading this book but unfortunately, found the small size of the print made it impossible. I have been buying all kinds of books from Amazon for years and this is the first one I could not read comfortably even with my glasses. (Hope I can find one with larger print.)"
5,Makes all his other recordings obsolete...,"This is not an overstatement. Much better in every way than 90% of the stuff he's released in the last 40 years. Recording quality is superb. The performances are spot-on. The guy is just swinging like crazy. Much better than ""Montreaux"", ""Live in Tokyo"" and miles beyond the ""Eu sei que eu vou te amar"" disaster. But it also even makes some studio recordings obsolete. The definitive version of ""Malaga"".""La vem a bahiana"" is a great old Dorival Caymmi tune previously unrecorded by Joo. The guy just keeps getting better, his voice richer, the guitar more assured, and he was in peak form this evening. You may be asking yourself, ""Do I really need another version of Joo doing ""Corcovado""? Trust me, get this and you won't be disappointed."
3,Not as good as the Tokyo album,"I can't agree with the other reviewer. I think both the Tokyo and the Montreux Jazz albums are better than this one. In fact, I think a few of the performances on this album are not all that good. I think he messes up a few of the songs, compared to other of his recorded versions (I can't bear to listen to ""De Conversa em Conversa"" and ""O Pato"" on this one). He sounds like he's out of breath; he seems to sustain notes with his voice much less than normal. In a couple of places he just plucks the guitar too hard and the strings clang very horribly.The Tokyo album just sounds much more effortless (though he did mess up ""Bolinha de Papel"" there). Not to mention that it's cheaper and ships quicker."
5,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC !!,This book is very good for the beginner. It guides the artist through projects. I would recommend for anyone. Very pleased.
2,Very Disappointed in Show,"Attended a show in July 2011. Very disappointed. Music was ok, but lead singer disapplayed an ""attitude"" that just didn't energize the show."
2,"If you want beach music, The Beach Boys is a lot better","I just borrowed this album from a colleague and I seriously have a hard time figuring out what makes this album deserve five stars across the board, even after reading some of the other reviews. Granted that most likely it's only been reviewed by his fans and his opposers don't waste the time to drop a line criticizing his work in Amazon, I felt I had to step in, representing the latter group. As a whole, the album lacked substance in more than one way: lyrically it was weak, almost meant to not think about it (even if you try), which I guess is fine, if all you want is not to think... as in a beach setting. However musically, most songs sounded like a refry of Cat Stevens with harmonica. In my mind, if you want beach music that is really good, you tune to The Beach Boys, so no: I did not like the album, and I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Essential for any Buffett collection,"Released in 1977, this album contains two of Buffett's concert staples -- ""Changes in Latitudes..."" and ""Margaritaville"". The latter being his highest charting single to that point since ""Come Monday"". Buffett maintains the style that has made him so popular for four decades, now. Relax, kick back, listen to the ocean, pop open a beer, and let Jimmy make you just a little bit happier for a while."
5,Must have Banana Republic is included-not on box set,Somehow Banana Republic got left out of the Buffett greatest hits CD's. It is my all time favorite and should not be missed.
3,Some of Buffett's finest music!,"Changes in Lattitudes,Changes in Attitudes is one of Jimmy Buffett's best and most loved albums.While not really a major statement in the music world,as Jimmy Buffett albums go this a pretty good one. Changes in Latitudes,Changes in Attitudes,Biloxi,and Margaritaville are the highlights.This is a fine starting point for new Buffett fans."
4,A good listen,"Jimmy Buffett / Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes: While this is not a great album is it an enjoyable one and it has the added attraction of ""Margaritaville"". A nice Four Star album."
1,Stale,"The last order I placed, most of the boxes that I received contained stale wafers. They were rock hard and not edible. I am so bummed that I may not purchase these wafers again, which is sad because when they're not stale, they can actually be quite good. But I expect every box to live up to the same quality control measures, to be light and crunchy and delicious, and I am really disappointed in how many packages of my last order were so stale they hurt my teeth to bite into them."
1,PrettyPets tortoise food,"Received product and the lebel did not match the actual image lebel (online), can not verify the authetic PrettPets tortoise food.the actual label on the bag was a sticker of a 3 LBS BAG PrettyPets tortoise food with a small sticker ""Net weight 20 lbs...) tape over the3 lbs."
2,Good For A Few Chuckles,"I am a huge fan of SURVIVOR, and I eagerly lap up any related merchandise, so purchasing this tape was a no-brainer. I don't know if it would have any value to someone not familiar with the show, but I thought it was a decent parody. Nothing was roll-on-the-floor funny, but the tape did a good job of lampooning many elements of the show. The reason I didn't rate the tape higher is because it is so short. I don't know the exact running time, but it didn't feel like it was longer than 10 minutes. That puts the cost of this tape at about $1 per minute. The amount of entertainment I got from it isn't worth that much."
1,Did I watch the same video?,"Agreeing with ""A viewer from vienna, VA"", this has to be the worst video I ever watched. Only 15 minutes long, there was nothing funny about this video at all - not even from a crude or juvenile point of view. There was no catchy music, nobody remotely resembled the character they were portraying, I can't fathom how anyone from any background, age or level of education could find this film to be worth the tape it's copied on to. Doesn't even rate a spot on Atomfilms.com. They say everyone has their 15 minutes of fame, the producers of this film blew theirs ..."
3,Pretty Funny But...,This video was an Amazon recommendation for me. I read the description and ordered it. Today it arrived and I watched it. Much of the material was rather clever and funny if you had seen the corresponding references on Survivor. However I must say that since I had failed to read any of the previous customer reviews I was pretty shocked and disappointed to learn this video was only 15 minutes long. I wasn't expecting 39 hours but I figured it would be at least an hour.
1,The Worst Video Ever Made,This is the worst video ever made. It is an amateur production involving a bunch of people sitting in a room and ad-libbing and free-associating (at least I hope this doesn't actually reflect a script) regarding various Survivor themes. It is depressing that this is the best these people could do with a subject that is ripe for parody.
4,What's your beef?,"I don't usually write reviews, but when I saw the last one I had to say something. Man, did we see the same thing? Yeah, it's not Oscar material, but it sure is a good laugh ... especially if you're a Survivor fan. Lighten up."
1,Sufferer,"I ordered this on the strength of the reviews in your data bank, all except one were five stars. The lone exception (a one star), I note, has since been removed. I am suspicious of all these five star reviews. I doubt many viewers would find this such a good parady of Survivor. This fifteen minute tape is a disappointing undertaking for a subject ripe for satire with clever writing and good acting. This ain't it."
2,This Kit Is Far From Premium,"Everything inside this kit except the tow strap is incredibly flimsy, but the worst part is the most important--the puny jumper cables. There is NO ECONOMY in cheap jumper cables. The gloves wouldn't protect your hands from a mosquito bite. The flashlight had no batteries and the switch was broken. The only thing worse than having this kit in a roadside emergency would be having nothing at all, but I am extremely disappointed with this product. Premium? In a pig's eye."
4,Burrell is an icon,"Burrell plays with the most assured soulful style - not hard to see why he was the sideman of choice in the 50's and 60's. This is one of his fine outings for verve.. playing with a larger band brings out a lot of fire from kenny. This is essential listening especially for aspiring guitarists (like myself)..Kenny Burrell, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Pass are the 3 guitarists of the 60's that I most admire... Jim Hall too..."
3,solid,"all the diecast Bob the Builder toys are the way to go. My son has the whole ""team"" and he loves them. The magnetic roller trailer attaches just like the Brio trains simple for a todler to do so more time to play.The ""talking"" plastic Bob the Builder toys are junk. We had to put them away (hidden) because they fall apart with even the gentalest play. Unless you want to keep puting something back together and deal with a disapointed little one, stick with the dicast."
1,Beware - this is the size of a matchbox car,My husband and I were very disppointed when the toy arrived. The picture made it look larger and for the price it should have been.
1,ellenw,"Beautiful colored picture was extremely misleading. I was sure that, for that kind of money, the toy would be much larger. I feel I was ripped-off."
2,Gauge,"OK Quality, Just do not expect anything close to OEM type quality.gauges performs as should though."
2,you get what you pay for,"Installed the 8211 on a 2011 harley road glide . after 200 miles the neddle would not fall back to zero with the power off. Now i do not know if the gauge even works. The seller was great no problem , problem is in the product."
1,dishonest marketing,"Is not an oil pressure gauge... says ""temp"" on it. It didn't work in my boat, and if it had it would still look like the water temp gauge."
4,gauge,this item completes the installation of the gauges in my new dash board on my classic auto restoration project. Thanks.
2,Lame CD,"Based on the other reviews I thought I was buying a fun CD. I was wrong. There are one or two songs that were ok, the rest are garbage. I was hoping for a fun, goofy Christmas CD, but instead got a lame piece of junk."
3,"Love the actor, Hated the movie.","I watched this movie because Dirk Benedict is my all time favorite, I think that all three of the stars go to him... The movie itself was simply bad, I've never seen something phonier. This was filmed in 1990? Even Star Wars had better special effects!"
5,I Do Love Ella!,"Ella is a ""singers singer""!I think I have almost have every recording available by this iconic artist. She was a favorite of my mother and her mother as well, and the great appreciation for her work was passed down to me! These recordings were made during her absolute peak as a singer and this two disc CD contains many wonderful standards from ""Misty"" and ""Laura"", to her legendary hit, ""A Tisket, A Tasket"". When Ella sings these standards, they always seem fresh....I could actually listen to her sing a phone book! The biggest surprise for me was Ella singing live, ""Summertime"" and ""I Loves You Porgy"", and singing them as straight romantic ballads.....so much better than her collaboration with Louis Armstrong on their ""Porgy And Bess"" album! That is possibly the only Ella recording that was a disappointment for me.The quality is good on these, so if you're a fan, this set is a must, if you're just discovering her work, then it's a must too!"
5,Fit my Sharp Caraousel perfectly,"I could not find the model # or anything on my microwave anywhere. I measured for the size but I basically ordered blind hoping it would fit the triagnular shaped peg in the middle. It did! A friend gave me one to use until my order came in but the glass plate had a hole to fit a square peg on the botton. Didn't fit on correctly and was tipsy and wouldn't turn. Hubby had a cramp because he couldn't defrost a steak and my son nearly died waiting the 3 days for shipment so he could have his microwave popcorn. Anyways - this fit my Sharp model and fits a triagular based peg - just for future reference. I looked over the reviews hoping to find this information before ordering and could not - thus the blind order and hoping for the best, which thankfully worked out!"
4,Sturdy & serviceable,"How can you rate a microwave tray? It fits in the microwave, it's easily removable and cleanable, it rotates as it's supposed to. Its only flaw is that it doesn't sit solidly on the center spindle, but wobbles a bit. So far this hasn't affected performance in the slightest, no matter how large or small the item being heated is."
4,fits and works just like original,"It is the correct size, just as stated, and fits many brands other than samsung. The three nubs under the glass plate, which hold it in place, are smaller than the original plate. Thought it might be a problem with the plate slipping, but not enough to make a big difference. Plus the weight of the object I am microwaving helps hold it in place."
5,Microwave Replacement Plate,I searched for a replacement plate for my microwave oven. This was the cheapest even though it was for a different make - it worked.
1,Not so in stock,This item listed in stock by this company and after four days my order was canceled because it was not in stock. It is still today showing in stock with the ability to order through Amazon. I ordered other items at the same time such as a cover which I have already paid for and received. Now I am stuck with the other items and am going to have to buy a new microwave or find another source for the tray. It is no wonder this company has 5% negative feedback. On top of all this they are not actually Samsung but another company out of California.
2,"Professors love it, Students hate it","This book is very dense for the number of pages it has. We used it in my grad comparative politics class. It can be useful for someone who already knows something about comparative politics, but if you are new to comparative politics look elsewhere. Very dry, very dense"
4,Worth the money sucky box set,Like the title says it was worth the money I paid you get all the season but it do come In Two spindles which make it hard to see which season you want to see so you might have to invest in a DVD/CD booklet for it
3,"Great DVDs, horrible case.",I love this show and watch it all the time. There isn't a lot of tv shows that I feel comfortable having on around my child but this show is very clean and the humor is clean as well. The only thing I don't like is the case it came in. All the disks are stack on top each other and stuck on a peg. I ended up having to buy one of those booklets that dvds/cds can be stored in.
1,Horrid video quality.,"I should have heeded the warning I read of this release. Cheap price, yes. But embarrassing video quality. Too many episodes on one dvd equals too many artifacts and trails. Very unhappy :-("
1,King of Queens a Royal Disappointment,"This review only concerns itself with the quality of the dvds themselves.The show is fine.The dvds arrived within the time stated but...the dvds arrived sitting upon one another in two portions of the box set, so that they may scratch AND the dvd quality is like the old LP or SLP versions of VHS. For thos of you who are not familiar with the old VHS settings, LP and SLP are much lower resolution and quality. These dvds are barely watchable.Very disappointing."
3,Great Show/Sub-Par DVD Quality,"Like the reviewer before me, I have to say that the quality of the DVD's in this set is sub-par. (The content, as any fan of the show already knows, is fine.)The DVD's exhibit artifacts and jerky motion despite my having an excellent Sony upconverting DVD player and 40"" Sony Bravia LCD connected via HDMI.None of my other DVD's have these issues...whether my 50 or so movies or the half dozen or so series (Sopranos, The Wire, Seinfeld etc.)This is not in any way to say the shows are unwatchable or unenjoyable. It is merely an observation that the quality of the engineering etc. leaves much to be desired.I don't think these are knock-offs as they were purchased directly from amazon.com...however, had they not been on sale for $94 (and had I not had a gift certificate to further lower the price) I'd have returned the set to amazon. I only decided to hold on to it as my wife is a big fan and doesn't mind the minor glitches (which I find somewhat annoying and distracting)."
1,Not a Happy Customer,Basically this was not a good purchase. The box was poorly constructed and falling apart because of bad design/construction. Some disks were duplicates while others were missing.
5,Great deal for the whole series.,"This show is really funny. Especially the early episodes. The very funny bickering between the husband and wife are hilarious. The actress, her attitude was perfect. She was excellent in this series. The snappy comebacks from the husband were very funny and original. Sometimes the father was annoying because his character here was basically the same one he played on ""Seinfeld"". However, his situations along with the rest of the characters were well written and constantly funny. I didn't pay much attention to this series when it first aired on TV.And you can't beat the price here at amazon for all of the episodes."
4,good dvd sets..looking for HD version...,It is a set of regular DVD. not HD quality. but it is definitely worth the money. all discs are loaded without problems. love it!
5,It's Perfect,I love the delivery truck in which all 9 seasons are held. I also like the fact that the synopasises of the seasons are kept under the hood of the truck as well. I'm enjoying watching all DVDs. This show is hysterical. Wish I had watched it when it first premiered.
5,"Solid Gold Comedy, in a very cute package","Although I'd only seen a dozen or so episodes on TV, that was enough to convince me that The King of Queens was a must-have collection, and that I had to see it all, right from the very beginning.The show must have been great fun to write and film, because the high standard of each episode's story-line, the excellent chemistry between the talented actors, and the lively vibe that the show exudes, is so infectious.Along with the Everybody Loves Raymond, and 'Till Death series, I just love the clever and insightful comedy that is contained within the nuances, and the highs and lows of grown-up human inter-relationships.This show delivers a truckload of laughs!"
5,SICK OBSESSION WITH MAYONNAISE,"This show is brilliant. Perfect casting. KJ was never better. Leah is perfection and the meaner she got as the series continued, the louder we laughed. Jerry brings even more brilliance.No complaints about this show. I miss it. It is a modern classic.p.s. - Not so big on these fancy box sets. What a waste of space and paper! Wish they had created something compact and shelf-able (is that a word?). I just want to watch this show, I dont want to display it like a home accent. I get it - it's cute and all but damn, there needs to be a version for people who just want what's important - the SHOW! What the heck am I gonna do with a giant cardboard van!"
5,King of Queens complete series.,Great price. Great box set. Great comedy series. Huge Stiller and Kevin James fan. Now I can watch when I want to.
4,King of Queen dvds,"This was a great price for the complete King of Queens series.The dvds came fast with no glitch and so far the ones I have seen have been good quality.The only drawback is that I wish they would have put some kind of material between the dvds to prevent scratching. Even a thin slice of cardboard would be better.I have put paper towels between the discs, but it makes the box thick.I still would order these again, though and try to be creative in fixing the problem, when it keeps the price and quality so good!"
5,King of Queens - Classic Comedy !!! Blu Ray???? Please ???,"Having worked on the show for 7 of the 9 seasons, I feel very fortunate to have been there for such a funny, classic show. It was truly a family with such a great cast and wonderful crew. Roger Lundblade and I warmed up the audience who were always happy and upbeat to be there, which made our job much easier. What a great experience that I will treasure always. Now when is it going to be released in a box set of the entire series? I'm waiting to relive all those great shows in Hi Def !!!"
2,Great Show - Nice Collection - Horrible Quality,"For between $27 and $40, this is a good bargain for the complete collection of one of the funniest sitcoms of our lifetime.Buyer beware however, the video quality is as good or worse as streaming the episodes from the web. No subtitles - not even in English. No deleted scenes. Simply put, Sony Pictures put absolutely no care in producing these DVDs.Its really unfortunate after seeing that its partner series, Everybody Loves Raymond, got excellent treatment from HBO Home Video and each of its seasons came out on DVDs in superb picture quality.Considering King of Queens runs all the time on TBS and other HD channels, you may be better off continuing to watch it on TV."
5,Amazing Set! Amazing Show! AMAZING!,"I really like the King of Queens. The show is great. The packaging to this set is really good too. It is shaped like an IPS truck, and in the back, you open the flap, and there are all 9 seasons! In the hood, if you open that there is an episode guide to each episode, and each season. I think that it is worth the $114.99, cheaper then it should be! But that's good, because you get a really good show, for a great deal. So, if you are thinking about purchasing this show, DO IT NOW! It will be a really good choice and you won't regret it!"
4,Great Comedy,"KofQs is up there with the best sitcoms there has been, i would recommond this box set."
1,"I love the series, but the packaging is incredibly cheep","Well King of Queens is one of my all time favorite shows. I was sooo excited to see that they were re releasing the series at a incredibly cheeper price!!! It was almost to good to be true. You can purchase the old packaging but for 100+ dollars. This packaging in this current form basically piles all the DVDs in two deep pockets. There are no separate cases for each season. So you have to be very careful not scratch the discs. I think that because of new digital download erra is upon us, that companies dont care how the deliver there dvd content any more. They lower the price and make it seem like the best thing ever, and now you are stuck with a cheep box and a pile of discs with no cases. So if you must own this product at the price of $40.00 and dont care about having your DVD cases nice and protected, go for it. If not, i would spend the extra money to get the nicer packaging.I hope this help you out!"
1,The King of Queens - The Complete Series,I really wouldn't know what the item is like. I never received it. All of my emails to the company have gone unanswered. The charge to my credit card is now in dispute. This was the first and will be MY last order from Amazon.
5,Love it!,Received quickly and impressed with how many disks came with the set for the price!For what came with the set it was more than expected and a very nice surprise!
5,It doesn't get any funnier!,KOQ was a great show! It nevers gets old. This is every show from start to finish. You won't be disappointed!
3,Scratched discs,I got the product as a gift. We love the show but the quality of the discs were not up to par. Most of the discs have scratches on them and one cd will not even play in the DVD player. Some shows skip.
5,FUNNY STUFF!,AWESOME! A SQUILLION LAUGHS! IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BUYING IT...TAKE THE LEAP. WELL WORTH IT.
2,King of Queens,This is one of my favorite shows of all times. I thought I would get a complete series of all the seasons ...as it states...but a few of the CD's have duplicate episodes on them...and the series doesn't follow the episodes in a correct order.
2,don't like it.,I did not like the way it was packaged. I don't like the cd's on top of each other making them easyer to get scratched.
3,"No deleted scenes, no bloopers","Please note: If I were rating the show itself I would give it 5 stars. The show itself is hilarious. The interplay between Kevin James, Leah Remini, and Jerry Stiller is fantastic. But, if you are reading this you probably already know that.I give the box set release 3 stars because there are no deleted scenes, bloopers, or show commentaries. I've seen all the episodes. I was hoping for the same kind of extras that Seinfeld, Everybody Loves Raymond, and The Office put into their season DVD releases. The extra 'bonus' disc with this set is pretty worthless.If you don't care about bonus features, then by all means, buy this set. The show looks good, sounds good, and the truck is pretty cool."
5,Still The King,"The King Of Queens is one of the most underrated sitcoms of all time. It wasn't ground breaking in anyway, but it was one thing that many sitcoms are not...consistently hilarious. For sure you can pick out some clunker episodes over the course of nine seasons, but every season has multiple roll on the floor laughing your butt off episodes. The characters all work well together and during the course of the series' run, every cast member was giving a chance to shine. Of course what really makes the show work are the two leads Kevin James and Leah Remini. On paper there is no plausible way that Doug and Carrie would be together, but the two leads mesh so well and seamlessly, that it totally works. The show has a timeless quality and could have worked in any tv era. Long live the King!"
5,Classic Comedy,"My wife and I have been big fans of the show and debated on whether or not to buy the box set based on the fact we had seen so many episodes already. Truth is, you could watch these over and over. It's just a down to earth comedy based on real world people and real world issues. Doug (Kevin James) is great and definetly represents most married men in my opinion. In short, you can't go wrong with this box set."
4,love it,love the show great packaging the only thing i would like chaged about this is the way the disc are just stacked int he box but all in all very much worth the money
5,Great show,"If you've never seen this show, then buying the complete series is the way to go. I power-watched all nine seasons in less than two weeks, and it is one of the best tv series that I have ever seen. The realistic scenarios and bickering between Doug and Carrie mirror real life. It is definitely worth the money. This show will have you laughing in no time."
4,The king of queens the complete series,"Show is great. The packaging, not so much. I see why it is so cheap for an entire series. All the discs are stacked on top of each other in 2 deep wells instead of each having a seperate holder like a good box set would have."
5,"King of Queens, the Boxed set of the whole series!","King of Queens, my favorite sitcom ever. I splurged on the IPS truck dvd holder. For me its worth it. A true keepsake for my collection."
4,"Newer packaging..not as happy with but, price :)","The series itself is 5 stars...the new packaging is cute but, I am not fond of the DVD's sitting on top of one another with no protection I fear scratching down the line. The box comes out of the main box and opens up to all the discs stacked on 2 sides. Great to lower the costs down just hope over time the DVD's will remain in good shape. So far no problems found with the disc thus far."
4,Does the job,Just sprinkle it around and the snails disappear. Have to reapply about twice during the season.
3,Quite good but some problems,"I wish I could give this 3 1/2 stars but I'll settle for 3. It is huge fun at first to see yourself in The Sims. I have had no trouble importing the created Sims into the expansion packs, at least up to Hot Date anyway. The problems are that there really isn't enough data points when defining the Sims head so the end up with almost block like heads. Another thing is the heads are about 3 times the size they should be so you end up with something looking a little like you but with a huge squared off head:) I wish they'd had enabled more points to define the shape of the head and had more bodies to choose from. All in all fun for awhile but could of been a lot better.Point to note, this is for the original SIMS NOT SIMS 2"
2,Close but no cookie,I have found that Face Factory is pretty good for making faces for the Sims game. It does install into the game nicely. One big problem I have found is that there are only a few bodies to choose from. There is a link in the program that you can find more bodies but everytime I go there it says it can't find it. I am somewhat frustrated and almost regret not getting the Sims Deluxe edition. I have created a very cool monkey head and a alien head using face factory but that is as far as it goes. If anybody has any ideas on how to get more body styles for the face factory please contact me. Thanks 8-)
5,"Powerful, sad, and compelling","A super-depressing, but well acted, and very engrossing Swedish drama about an late-middleaged couple struggling with the husband's sudden onset of Alzheimer's-based dementia. They are both high-level musicians, and the love of art intertwines their love for life, and each other. This film is very good and certainly worth watching (it's more of a European art film than an American-style disease-of-the-month flick), but it is definitely a big old downer, so be prepared."
4,"Moving and worthwhile, if arguably flawed","A moving film about two late middle aged people (a composer/conductorand a first violinist) who find each other, fall madly in love, leavetheir marriages, only to have Martin develop Alzheimer's.The bulk of the film is watching his slow decline, as he slowlydisappears, leaving his lover behind.Tremendously sad, yet somehow also a little cold, not as emotionallyimpactful as I kept wanting it to be.The acting is terrific, but there's something both a bit clinical, anda bit manipulative about it. E.g. Martin's attacks too often come atthe (too) perfectly dramatic moments. Also, there's no time spent onthe wrenching decision for each to leave their earlier marriages, sowhy include it?Yet, all that said, it's still a strong, moving experience. A grown upmovie about older people in a world with far too few of both."
4,How to Survive with Dignity,"Altzheimers...whew, this is an accurate depiction of succumbing to its debilitating grip over mental and physical processes. In fact, I suspect that this film will become the definitive take on the subject, short of actual documentation; the acting from the leads is utterly compelling, achingly accurate(from my experiences of those afflicted with the disease). Its a downhill roll with little or no reprieve, though through the eyes of a supremely loving spouse, we feel that the diseases lessons are intolerably awkward to accept. I gasped for air myself when, still clinging to memories and the restitution of happier times, our heroine escorts Martin to their honeymoon beachside, only to have him nearly drown her. Moments of humour both light and dark are conveyed with great attention to detail and timing, a testament to the team who put this work together."
1,Not very good.,I am a big RUSH fan. This band sounds a little bit like them but lacks the professional polish that RUSH has always had.The first song on the CD is the best and then it goes downhill from there. :-(
3,Richard Pryor: Stand-Up Comedy Double Feature,"I'd always heard that Richard Pryor was one of the legendary AND revolutionary comedians. So I was looking forward to this. Rest assured, Pryor is very funny. But I guess being 27, it's hard to put myself in a mindset where he's the funniest or edgiest comedian around. You can definitely see how he would have inspired some of the smuttier humor of Eddie Murphy, but I'm confused as to how he would have been a role model to Chris Rock or Jerry Seinfeld.If you are a big fan of stand-up comedy and want to get familiar with Pryor, this is definitely worth buying, but try to find it used and less than $15."
4,classic and 'rich',"what con one say about the funniest comic ever that has not already been said? I will just say that behind the best ever comic flim, 'Live in Concert', also by Pryor, these two concert films are his best. they are not as rich in material and social commentary as the aformentioned classic but great still."
5,Richard Pryor DVD,"Item is excellent, I am a big fan of Richard Pryor and I feel like I have purchased a little slice of history. Have watched it numerous times and it plays perfectly. Thanks so much"
2,Tedious,"I like Sayers, but this story was tedious, repetitive, and burdened by emphasis on the code which is lengthy and not much fun for plot or intellect. The denouement is not so brilliant that it can carry this weight . I wouldn't recommend this book to any but true aficionados."
4,Solving an unusual cryptogram,"For anyone interested in methods of cryptanalysis, Dorothy Sayers' ""Have his Carcase"" offers a very clear explanation of the Playfair system of encryption and how to attack a cryptogram so enciphered. Most any book on codes and ci[phers will present the Playfair method, but not as lucidly or step-by-step engagingly as does Sayers. For the like-minded, a good ""read."""
4,Good mystery without blood and guts,"So nice to read a mystery with plot and character development, that does not depend on car chases, bedroom scenes, and violence for its effect."
2,Scholarly summary?,"This book is nothing more than a summary of positions that different scholars hold on the Eucharistic readings of the New Testament. There is nothing new; what's more, there is nothing edifying. It is also unclear through the course of the book whether Kodell supports the historicity of the Gospel accounts; this historicity is clearly affirmed in the Church's Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation (Dei Verbum), and one would hope a Catholic monk like Kodell would stick to Catholic positions. Also, Kodell does not seem to draw the distinction between what the Savior said (whether He spoke the institution narrative Himself or not) and the revealed Scriptures which transmit all that is needed for salvation. Finally, this book has a number of historical inaccuracies - for instance, pp. 48-9 incorrectly elaborate upon the ""Todah"" sacrifice (he apparently never read Leviticus 17). Look elsewhere, especially towards Louis Bouyer and J. Jungmann."
1,Another dust collector,I thought this recording would be better than it was. It's sitting on my shelf getting dusty. Very disappointing.
5,Simply a must...,"This is simply a must for any anthology of Cole Porter. Excellent, if not the best recordings of each song in the collection."
5,Good Date Night CD,"My wife was the one prompting me to buy this CD. I have to say, I am pretty impressed by how the different artists sing Cole Porter songs. Truly a CD to play on a date night."
3,Where is the rest of the documentary?,"I have owned the VHS edition for thirteen years. My brother ordered the DVD from Amazon. We watched the whole documentary and I noticed that the dvd version only covers history up to 1965. The rest of the documentary is missing, I know because I play this every year for my students for Black History Month. My VHS set covers everything up to the 1980's!!! I rather spend the $100.00+ for the complete series instead of this cut version. Please issue the COMPLETE documentary on dvd. Meanwhile, I will just hold on to my VHS set."
5,Get the DVD at PBS,"Sorry folks, but I just don't see paying $1K for the seven ancient VHS tapes when the ones who loved this documentary the first time 'round can watch it with the next generation on DVD.Enjoy."
5,The BEST documentary ever!,This documentary contains actual footage on the struggle for freedom in America. You will hear some of the greatest speeches from the 1950's and 1960's. You will experience the persecution and the victory achieved by Blacks in America. Many of the people who survived the civil rights era are interviewed and allowed to provide a modern day perspective. Some of MLK's closest friends give you insight on MLK. No other resource on the civil rights movement will educate you as throughly and as powerfully as this video.
5,Probably the best documentary handling of the subject...,"I remember first seeing this documentary on PBS in 1987.This same subject matter has been handled before and since (in both dramas and other documantaries) but never so effectively, so comprehensively -- or so hauntingly.It's a ""must"" for anyone's DVD library."
1,shameless rip-off sequel,"This is the most brazen theft of a beloved literary character since Alexandra Ripley's sequel to Gone With The Wind. Thank goodness this is out of print. ""Special Day"" does NOT address the problem of pokiness at ALL. The illustrator did not even bother to draw the Poky Little Puppy properly, instead marring the pages with depictions of a freakish albino dog-boy. Let us speak of it no more."
2,I was disappointed too,"Like one of the previous reviewers of this book, I was disappointed. I found it tedious and repetitious. It's a sad let down for fans of Benny. Key players in Hill's shows, like Jackie Wright were all but ignored. But if you must have everything about this beloved British comic, go for it."
3,"The Lad himself, Benny Hill!","It is quite obvious after reading this book that Mr. Ross is a genuine fan of ""The lad himself"" from not only the depth of research but also the personal take that he puts on the book in the last few segments. The ONE thing that kept me from giving this book a 5 star rating is that, although he mentions co-stars such as Jack Wright, Sue Upton, Louise English, and Henry McGee, he neglects to put pictures of them in the book with Benny. For fans of the show they know who these people are but not so the occasional viewer who might buy the book hoping to find out a bit more about Benny and his show. Despite this, it's a great book and well worth the money."
3,I liked the first and second and this one too.,this is a movie that i had to watch twice. stuff happens in flashes just as in the previous ones and it keeps you guesssing what will happen next? They could have made more of an effort to make the characters a little deeper.thats my only negative for this movie. the people in the movie are just people in a movie.the premis of traveling in time is sooooooooo profound and deep and rich. who wouldnt want to have the power to travel back in time and fix anything you wanted to? that would be soo awesome! Thats why i like the series.its just that this movie seem too detatched.
2,Dumbest Hero Ever,"Stupidity plays a great role in thrillers but this time it's just unbelievable.I can't really begin to tell you without any spoilers, so you're warned.Hero is advised to witness the events and what does he do, goes into the house, only to find the slashed body of former girlfriend. And what the heck was he thinking when he decided to watch another victim in her closet, come on! How close do you have to get in order to see the killer, in his a$$? While you were there pick up the murder weapon, why don't you, dumb a$$!Even the main idea is dumbified at the finale, it turns out he had time to save both his sister and his mom & dad but he chooses to kill off his sister anyway. Who is the sick psycho now, idiot!Only good thing about this movie was the love scene and guess what, he couldn't deliver, aww...Don't buy, don't watch. Don't make me say it again."
2,best of the butterfly effect movies,This was the best of all the Butterfly Effect movies so far. At least I liked it better than the first two.
2,Boring,I watched this movie on cable the other night and have to say that the movie was less than mediocre. It's not the worst film I've ever seen. But I figured out who the bad guy was half way through the film. It was too predictable and just not all that stimulating. I thought the dialogue was at times over the top and overly dramatic.
3,Butterfly Effect: Reveation,"The Butterfly Effect: Revelation revolves around a young man who discovers he has inherited the powers of time travel and attempts to solve the mystery of his high school girlfriend's death using his new found ability, only to unwittingly unleash a vicious serial killer."
1,Macintosh Platform???,"I have a new imac and was looking for a mac mahjongg game. I bought this one because this site said this game was for both the PC and Mac platforms. Needless to say, I was very disappointed after receiving this game to find out that it is only a PC platform game!!! Both stars should be zero!!"
4,Black Shoes,"I bought this same shoe from a local store and wore them for three years. I walk a lot so I wore them out in three years. I could have had them re-soled but... I found the same shoe online and ordered my size thinking I'd end up sending them back. Not the case at all. I have new shoes that fit, and I didn't have to send them back. Good value and a great fitting shoe that should last me another three years."
1,unhealthy,"Is there anywhere to buy the old filters without the blue wrapping.I have used Honeywell Humidifiers for many years and never had the smell / mold problem you do with these filters, they are downright unhealthy.I tried to rate these zero stars they are that bad but the system would not let me.Please go back to the old filters"
2,Air purifier makes the filter stink,I've noticed a bad smell when I use these filters after only a few days use. The old ones without the blue air purifier didn't smell like this. I will not use these again even if I have to buy a new humidifier when I can't find the old HAC-504 filters.
1,Bad news product,"This replacement filter suddenly began to emit a really foul odor. I soaked it for ten minutes as per the instructions but when I put it back in, the odor came back and my eyes started to burn. I realized I had to throw the thing out, which means I have no humidifier while the air is now very humid. Meanwhile I had to open the windows, with the temperature about 10 degrees outside, to get rid of the pungent odor and the sensation in my eyes - still not gone, several hours later. They need to re-do this filter, it is a Zero."
4,Fun listening experience,"I purchased this audio book to introduce my son to Edgar Rice Burroughs, and I wanted to listen to something that I hadn't read myself. I had already read much of the Tarzan series in my younger days, and have recently read the John Carter on Mars series.This series also follows the same formula that worked so well in the previous series. This is not great literature, but pure action and adventure, with romance thrown in. The author does a good job describing this inner world of Pellucidar, and picking up the weird landscapes and perspectives that would occur. I'm amazed at Burroughs imagination, and the fantastic creatures and races he comes up with.The reader was Patrick Lawlor, and he did a good job with the characterizations. We listened to this on a road trip, and it made the time pass very quickly. My son really enjoyed it also. I highly recommend this audio book."
4,into the depths,I have always been a fan of ERB since I was about twelve. I am over fifty.As an adult one realizes that ERB might not get published today. His books are simple good vs. evil tales that still have the power to ring your heart with his prose. At the Earth's core was not his best series nor his worst The Venus ones hold that distinction I think. Probably the best book in the series is Tarzan at the Earth's core. This volume is a good introduction and once you have read it you can decide whether to read any of the other's you probably will!Bill Hash author of AMRA availble through amzon.com
3,Most excellent,"An excellent video for those unversed in the question of ancient megaliths and monuments. The conclusions of the creators may be in question, but the evidence is undeniable. View ths film with an open mind but your doubts may win out. All in all, very intereseting."
4,The fabulous Helmut's work through the eyes of Vogue!,This retrospective shows Helmut's work as it appeared in numerous (mostly european) Vogue magazines. It's great to see how his photography was marketed through the decades. This collection is focused mostly on his 60's and 70's work.
2,Kids said this game is BORING,WOW I purchased this for my 11 & 12 year old niece and new few I am 47 so not knowledgeable about today's reviews I trusted other reviewers to guide me. Boy were they wrong! The kids said this game was BORING and they we right! I played along with them we barely finished 4 rounds before we said this game was stupid and changed to anther. I would not recommend.for adults or older BTW: even the 9yr old was BORED!
1,No actual content,"I'm sorry to report that this book merely presents an outline of steps to take, along with a collection of document templates, neither of which contain any actual ""content"". In other words, it tells you ""what"", but not ""how"". If you're looking for insight and real-world examples, look elsewhere. I couldn't justify a bunch of blank forms and outlines for such a cover-price. I sent mine back and Amazon graciously refunded my money."
3,"An okay point and shoot, but be prepared to replace it","I had used the DSC-S500's predecessors and was very pleased. Sony made some changes, however, that I found to be a pain. They switched to regular batteries from rechargable batteries, which means more batteries in the landfill. There is also a long delay when shooting and the color is even more blue (even by Sony's standards). After using this camera for 2 years, many of the buttons don't work - so I can't go through the menu to change settings."
2,so-so,PROs1) The quality is excellent.2) Easy to functionCONs1) It used batteries.2) I have to press at least 2 seconds in order to snap a shot.3) No shake control
1,Sony Cyber Shot,"A terrible camera, gave me nothing but trouble since day 1 - and, of course, the warranty only applies in the US. Too many problems to list but most annoying is the unreliability. I lost several photo shoots due to it."
1,Bad luck or bad camera,"Cons: On speed is slow. Auto focus is slow and take several blur images. It's not durable. The front finish wear in less than a year. The battery fail to connect. And the Sony service is very bad at least in Panama.Pros: Great Screen, small size, good quality pictures (when take focused)."
4,Good Camera,"It is a really good camera and takes really detailed pictures. Occasionally the photos come out blurry, but you just have to hold it with a steady hand. Overall, it is a very good camera, and it has lots of different options for taking pictures at night, landscapes, candlelight, etc."
4,Photographer differences?,"I have had my S500 for about about 6 months, and I have not had any problems with it so far. I do have pictures every once in a while that are blurry, but the vast majority of my pictures are clear as a bell. I don't know if the complaints have to do more with the photographer than the camera, because I have never had any problems. My only complaint about this camera (and the reason I gave it four stars) is that it does eat batteries quickly, as others have said. It is better with lithium batteries, but plain AA batteries go very fast."
4,Good,"This is an attractive camera. i dont like how it focuses. Also, i like that it shoots nice videos and has enough space to hold a good amount of them. i dont like however that i cant zoom while i am shooting a video. I have to zoom first and then shoot. But its small, very attractive, good price. I like it overall."
4,Great Camera,"Pros:Take good picturesCompact sizeEasy to UseGood that it uses AA batteries (depending on your preference)2GB memory card bought seperately, holds lots of pictures and they're relatively cheap compare to a year ago.Cons: Drains batteries quickly, should buy Nickle-Metal Hydride Battery if you plan to take more than just a few shots.Unlike some other cameras I've had experience with, this does not do well with close up pictures and the flash is unusually bright.Takes a bit longer to snap pictures than some other digital cameras.Overall, I am very satisfied with the product, I just couldn't give it a 5 star rating as I have experience with several other cameras that were a bit better for just a bit more money."
2,"i've had a lot of cameras, this one is the worst","i was swayed to buy this because of the price - and also knowing that the higher end sonys use a leica (or is it Z?)lens... well this one ain't all that. Half of the pictures are very out of focus, exposure is almost always off except in ""perfect"" situations, and it is very slow. I just used it for 2 months while traveling and I definately wouldn't recommend it; in fact i wish i could get a refund -- but it's not broken, just bad quality."
1,Very disappointing camera.,"I bought this camera thinking it would exceed the performance of my sony DSC-P10. The only one taht can do this is the DSC-V3. All pictures taken with the DSC-S500 are blurry/low quality even at 6MP. The DSC-P10 is a much better camera even though it is much older than the S500 and even though they both have a Sony lens, not a Carl Zeiss. Don't buy the S series. Since the P series and the V series are no longer available, go for the W series; the W30 is cheap and very good."
3,Not for parents,"I rarely review items and a even more rarely give bad reviews.This camera is pretty good and might be better than I can tell since I'm not much of an expert.BUT, for the reason we got it: to take pictures our baby. It stinks. It takes a few seconds from when you push the button to when the picture is taken.Just enough time for her to move and to no longer have a usable shot.I'm a lifelong Sony fan, but It's time for start looking outside the family."
1,Worst camera ever; do not buy.,"I researched before I bought this camera and based on the features and value, as well as a recommendation and photos I saw from another owner of the Sony, I purchased this camera. I am very disappointed in the clarity, quality and consistency of the photos. I have set, reset parameters and even taken the camera back to the store where I purchased it to have them figure out why the pictures have sections that are fuzzy. No one can explain it. I do not even take pictures anymore because I know they won't live up to my expectations of resolution, clarity or depth of field. I previously owned a Canon with less pixels and lost it, and replaced it with this one, which does not come near to the quality of the Canon. This one is going in the trash."
1,Poor quality and even worse support,"Skip this camera and focus on a different manufacturer. We bought this camera as a Christmas present, and less than 4 weeks after it was opened, the camera was broken (the lense was stuck). We were informed by Sony that since they didn't have any parts for the camera, we had to either take a refund, or a refurbished model. Even though we bought a new camera, we now have to accept a refurb since you can't even buy this camera for the same price anymore."
4,Great Camera -- Not much Memory,"I was disappointed when I gave this camera as a gift to discover the memory stick is rather small (that information was in the discription on Amazon.com, I just missed it). The recipient went to the nearest camera store and bought himself a memory stick for [...] and was delighted with the camera. It has lots of nice features and takes great pictures. It just was too bad that he had to spend money before he could use it completely."
4,So Far So Good,"I received this camera for my b-day. I am a scrapbooker and I like to take my camera with me when we go different places. Our big Cannon (10x optical zoom) is great, but too bulky for day-to-day use. I wanted something easy to slip in my purse, easy to carry when visiting family during the holidays, and basically something simple to grab when one of my ""kids"" does something cute! So far, this seems to fit the bill to a ""T""! I just love the 6 mega pixil and can't wait to get my first set of photos back."
2,Sony Cybershop,Item does not have a long life battery. Batteries need to be purchased ona regular basis. Also does not have a charger.
3,More work should be done in proofs,"Overall, the authors explain core concepts, the examples and the possible applications well. However, the readibility of their proof is far from that of the above three. Honestly some proofs should be re-written completely.For example, in page 116, they try to use the induction method to prove Lova(')sz Local Lemma. After reading that page many times, I still didn't understand the structure of their proof.I was TA for under-grad level algorithm course, got A+ in advanced Calculus II and A in intro. to PDE (both in under-grad level), really knew something about induction method and a little bit about algorithm. I am not smart, but far from stupid.In the end, I google the internet and found a 3-page proof for the same thing. That's easy to catch in few minutes, and then, I understand the 1-page proof in the book. Is it ironic?"
4,An enciclopedia for randomized algorithms.,The book has an exoustive amount of algorithms. Not everything is proved. Sometimes the proof contains to few steps to be understood. There are many algorithms explained well. After reading this book it is easy to create your own randomized algorithms.
3,Plastic Towing Mirrors,"Worked ok for a cross-country trip for Christmas. Wobble quite a bit at high speed, but stayed well connected to the factory mirrors via a tightening knob. When passed vehicles were visible in the outer mirrors, it was ok to pass, when visible in the inner mirrors it was not ok. For 50 bucks - I guess they were ok."
4,Good mirrors. BAD SERVICE!,"Mirrors are exactly what I expected. Amazon service was less than great though. Was in a time pinch and product showed to be in stock, so I ordered with next day delivery. On delivery date they still hadn't shipped. When I called and asked, amazon said they were now on backorder. Because of their error I had to pull my camper w/o tow mirrors. Not fun! Amazon did credit me what I paid for next day delivery, and after some serious and heated complaining gave me a $10 coupon to use on my next purchase. All I ask is deliver on your promise. After all, its what ""good"" business people do."
2,too gimmicky,"The dumper in the back is already full. My son can't put dirt or sand in the back and dump it out. It's already filled with plastic ""dirt"" with another layer of plastic ""dirt"" underneath that becomes visible when the top layer is ""dumped."" But even this dumpable top layer is attached to the toy...so nothing gets dumped! We got a tiny screwdriver and released a screw under the dumper (took forever), and the fake dirt popped out. Now my son is happy his Muck is ""fixed"".He asked us to fix the bucket, which is not curved enough to scoop any sand or dirt because there's a magnet inside. But there's no screw. So he can only use the little log it came with. As clever as the magnet is, it's only fun for a day.As is the trend, this toy is only capable of playing in a closed system. It doesn't fit into my son's life. Can't they just make me a Muck? Why do they have to gunk up the works?"
1,Matchbox Muck,This Muck can fit in the palm of your hand. If you were standing in a store and saw a Matchbox car would you pay eleven dollars for it pluis shipping?
1,Seriously?,"Is this toy roughly the size of a Hot Wheels car? If so, someone's got A LOT of nerve charging 50 bucks for it. That's totally outrageous!"
4,Worth a look,"Hal Borland was born in 1900 and wrote articles and columns for various publications. This book is a compilation of his columns in the New York Times. The book has a short essay for each of the 365 days of the year, focusing on nature and the seasons (and topics follow the season that each particular day is in). Sometimes the focus is more informational, describing, say, bird migration. Other times it is simply poetic. It has a northeastern slant. For example he describes a ""January Thaw"" that we don't notice in the West. It's slightly outdated in a few spots, but still really worth a read."
2,This book is simplistic,"The author provides case study after case study with practically no analysis himself. He spends an entire chapter promoting himself and lambasting a client who didn't heed his advice.Is this a good book for newcomers? Possibly. If you're a student and don't know much about public relations this book will probably interest you. If you're a practioner and this book is anything other than remidal reading, it may be time to consider finding a new career.To his credit, the author does present case studies that run the gamut from non-profits, to disasters, to educational instituions, to criminal clients. He does provide a wide array of different situations.I have no doubt that the author is an excellent practioner of the art of public relations. As a journalist and an instructor, the book leaves something to be desired."
5,Hidden gem of short story for fantasy lovers,"Where has this collection of stories been hidden? What a great set of tales ranging from childhood dreams and explorations of magic, to the special mysteries of Halloween, and unexpected death. All of these stories are great and all of them are different. A real must-read for fantasy lovers. My Kindle edition did have some editing issues with misspellings, but this in no way took away from the beauty of these stories. And they are all beautiful, artfully capturing the time, place and emotions, bordering on poetry. The last story is a cliff-hanger...so I eagerly await the resolution in the next installment. Hope the author does not disappoint me."
4,Interesting for all ages,This is a subscription I gave to my pre-teen daughter for Christmas and we are having a ball. I like to craft with her and this offers something for all skill levels.
4,Stand for the Faith,"The Basis of Christian Faith was written some time ago, but provides valuable information for those seeking support for their belief. Example: Who was the first to publish that there were about 333 prophecies about Christ in the New Testament? Read this book and the fact is presented. The Christian faith has strong evidence upon which to stand..."
5,"I Spy games are the best, Spooky Mansion is best of series",Both of my kids love to play with I Spy games. Spooky Mansion is probably the most fun and creative one. It is also the longest one. I highly recommend them. I hope Scholastic comes out with more I Spy games!
5,Highly Recommended,"My daughter has been playing all of the I Spy games since she was about 5 and she thinks they're terrific. She is now 7 and still enjoys them. We parents find them plenty clever and interesting, too. As a bonus, they work seamlessly on our Mac."
3,Not as good as thought....,I personally think that the huntville games are more challenging for my children than this game. I thought it would have many levels but it doesn't and my kids after a few hours had the whole game complete. The pictures we okay but the kids seem to find things easily. I was very disappointed.
1,Security Risk,"It's unlikely this will matter to most of you, but due to poor technical choices (or programmer incompetance) this game requires administrator privileges to run on Windows XP. For anyone concerned about the security and stability of their computer, the last thing you want is your kids running as admin, potentially deleting/changing your files or getting viruses on the machine. I use my PC for work and just can't risk losing important files, so this game has already been uninstalled since it won't work on the kids' login."
5,I Spy Spooky Mansion Review,"I spy Spooky Mansion is a fun game that takes place in a haunted house. You are guided through the house by a toy skeleton. She has you play the I Spy riddles to earn puzzle pieces, ingredients, and machine parts. The goal is to escape the house. After completing an adventure, you can start again, with a different way to escape the house and different riddles to do. I think this game deserves a 5 out of 5 because of great replay value, and puzzling puzzles."
1,"OUTDATED by 15 YEARS, 3 REVISIONS, and THOUSANDS of WORDS","This book was missing words and had typos 15 years ago. Since then there have been 3 major revisions to the dictionary. The last update alone had over 3200 words removed or added. By including words that have been removed such as DA and not including words that have now come to be accepted such as FE this book leads you astray and far behind. Two letter ""hook"" words like these make a huge difference when looking for good plays. This book is too outdated to be of use to anyone looking to improve their game. Take the advice of the champion player who wrote the first review listed 5 years ago and get your info somewhere else."
2,Not as useful as I thought it would be.,Not as useful as I thought it would be. Everything Scrabble or Bob's Word Game Bible are better choices...
1,Used book,"Book advertised in good condition. Book was in very poor condition. Faded, torn, dog-eared cover. Yellow brittle pages."
3,SCRABBLE WORD BUILDING BOOK,"Only had this book a short time, but do find it very useful. Especially in conjunction with the scrabble dictionary."
1,Awful,This book has been wrong on numerous occasions. My copy was printed in 2007 and is useless. I will be buying another book and putting this one in the fireplace.
3,Disappointed in Kindle version,I am very disappointed in the Kindle version as one cannot search the book. To flip through the pages looking for a certain letter takes entirely too much time. I would much rather have the paper version.
2,warning--outdated word list,"I haven't used this myself, but have seen it. This book is based on the 2nd Edition of the OSPD (Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary). Many additions, corrections, and some deletions were made for the 3rd Edition of the OSPD (published in 1995-1996), and the 4th Edition came out in 2006 adding several THOUSAND more words... SO this book is worthless. Don't Buy it.[Note: this review was originally written several years ago... Amazon won't let me change my star rating.. but I'd rate this book ZERO stars now]"
4,study this book,"If you ever want to be a good Scrabble player, study this book!While a little dated (since words have been removed from legal play) it still is the most complete list for building words."
2,Helpful,"The book was helpful but if you really want to have everything about Scrabble, you need the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary. Besides being a dictionary, you can enter a group of letters and it will give you the best Scrabble word. You can also play word games with it. It is made by the Franklin Company. Mine is very old but it still works like a charm. I wouldn't play Scrabble without it. John"
5,Helpful,"Finding words I never knew existed. BUT, tried a couple of the words found in this book on my Kindle Scrabble and words rejected. If you play Scrabble alot, this is a must have (or perhaps a newer version; this one is from 2006)"
3,dictionary is enough,"I use the book sometimes but, the recent Scrabble ditionary is all one needs. Anything else is already covered in the dictionary. It helps on Q words."
2,Scrabble Word Building Book,"When you use this book on your Kindle Fire with Words with Friends app...it is too hard to go back and forth to look at words you might be able to use and play the game. For the price, it was a waste."
3,good book to have to word build,Good book to have to build on existing words to boost one's points... took awhile to understand that but as I use it for it's intended purpose I like it more & more... glad I got this book...
5,Rare performances you will enjoy,"Although the cast of Monty Python performed some of their standard skits, the performances on this collection were unique given the circumstances.If you are a pop music fan you will apprciate Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck performing together, as well as Pete Townsend's acoustic set. A rare, early performance of Sting performing solo, two songs ""Message in a bottle"" and ""Roxanne"" (the latter is contained in the bonus material)Other notable performances include Donovan and Duran Duran.This collection seems pricey, however if you are a fan of British Comedy this is a must see collection."
2,Secret policeman's balls,A technically poor very old film. Not nearly as funny as the original Monty Python's Circus on BBC T.V. It was only somewhat amusing.
1,Avoid the Digital Download at all Costs,"The digital download for this item is much shorter than the DVD run time (a little over an hour). This isn't mentioned anywhere during the purchase process - it appears that only one of the five shows on the DVD are included, but you won't know it until the download finishes."
4,NOT the versions I watched in the U.S. 25 years ago....,"I bought these through another source, I'll admit that up front. They didn't say on their web-site that these weren't the versions originally cut for U.S. release back in the 80's. I desperately wanted to see Neil Innes performing, ""Urban Spaceman"" again. But it's not here. Not even in the EXTRAS. There are some things I don't remember seeing back then, and some of them are pretty note-worthy (I can't swear to seeing a pre-Dr. Who Sylvester McCoy do his red-hat and strip to his tidy-whiteys escape routine back then... but that was 25 years ago... the little gray cells are the first thing to go!!). If they ever want to make a decent amount of money for Amnesty, I suggest they gather up all the bits that were shown in the U.S. version but left out of this, the original british (international?) version, and put them all in a new release. My two cents. Thanks."
5,what a progression...,"First of all, do NOT go into this album expecting anything similar to what alexisonfire have done before. This album represents a huge musical growth for them. There is quite a bit more clean vocal use than there was in previous efforts. The song structure is less generic as well. However, this is a good thing. The clean vocals are VERY good. There is still plenty of screaming to satisfy your urge for that component of alexisonfire, though. This album is very deep and feels quite honest. This is a big step forward for this band in the quest to seperate themselves from the recent plethora of bands attempting to create a combination emo/hardcore sound. Definitely an album to pick up."
5,I miss the long intros...,"SO many bands have used the same formula as Alexisonfire (and FYI, that is Alexis on fire...not Alex is on fire) and sound like !@#$.so at first when I saw their videos being played on music stations I thought they were just another band like Taking back Sunday or Brand new. but when I actually listened to them it was obvious that they are talented musicians and in my opinion are the most creative band to come out of the hardcore scene in a long time.This album didnt dissapoint me at all.although I do miss some of the long intros from their first record, ""Watch out!"" is an amazing record in its own rights.some of the best tracks are ""Control"", ""Hey, its your funeral Mama"", ""Sharks and danger"", and ""White devil""."
1,lame,"this band is a joke. seriously, when are people going to stop with the screaming backup singer thing? it was cool with the first few bands, but can't any of these guys find their own original sound?"
4,Watch Out!,watch out is a great sophomore cd but it lacks. the 1st cd was much better in my opinion. This cd wasnt as hardcore and DID NOT have enough of georges screams. It wasnt as creative either. I suggest if you loved the 1st cd to download some of these tracks before you buy it because you might be surprised.
4,"Different Than Usual, But Good","This CD is not as heavy as the old one, but is still good. George is screaming less :( but Dallas sings alot more and is good. I can say the lyrics have gotten alot better than the last making this cd heavier because of the lyrics. Songs may seem softer but when George comes in its amazing....This CD still has amazing Guitar Riffs but may not be as fast all the times as the Previous S/T Album. This Cd is still very good and i recommend you buy it......For any ppl in the US wondering how i already have this CD Im In CANADA its been released already :P"
5,"Best from Alexisonfire, Hands Down","I fell in love with this band years ago. This is possibly my all time favorite album. The singing is a great counterbalance to the screaming. Excellent lyrics and feel, plus great musicianship all around. You must get this album!!"
5,Very Good Second Album,"It's funny reading a review that says that screaming music is childish and then later saying that changing from that course is selling out. I, personally, loved the first album and was very excited when Watch Out! was announced. I have listened to it many times. I have almost worn out the cd because of the repetitive listening. What many people call selling out I call maturing. Sure, it might bring them more mainstream success. How is that at all a bad thing. Unless, of course, you're not really a fan of the band. I don't understand how fans of a band hate to see them get popular. Being in a band can be a full time job and I think it should pay as well as one. So, if you really do like this band, definitely check out their new album. It's quite good."
4,Something I didn't expect,"Ok first off I despise 99% of all screamo,emo,hardcore,metalcore, blahblahcore bulls**t bands that have molested music of this day and age. This cd proves there is a light among the dark.The melody and atmospere of this album is something to be reckoned with. I could give less than a s**t about the pathetic emo lyrics and the screaming kept me from giving it a 5 star rating, but the music still redeems this band from genre obscurity. If these musicians can distance themselves from the cliche's of music today, they might possibly have a chance to survive the coming death of emo themed music for it is almost opon us. I am personally glad of that."
5,It Was Fear of Myself That Made Me Odd,"This album is beyond great and anyone who rights a review saying ""they could have done better"" or ""too soft to compare to their previous work"" or anything like that is dead wrong. This album is great and has so much depth and heart that it grabs you and pulls you in. The main hightlights of this album would have to be ""Fear of myself that Made me Odd"" and ""Control"". Their first album has greater points then this one, such as a better intro song (44. Caliber love letter) and maybe a better closing song (Pulmonary Archery). But this album is still worth buying and if you know what great music is then you won't be disapointed."
5,Favorite!!,This cd is different from their first album. I was blown away by it. It's definitely my favorite of the two. My favorite songs are : It was fear of myself that made me odd and Side walk when she walks. The rest of the songs are just as amazing. I recommend that you buy this cd. If you're an Alexisonfire fan you will not be disappointed
4,"Different, but still very good.","I haven't listened to this album much, but I've been through every track once. It is a bit different from the last album, but one thing is the same for sure... the amazing instrumentals. George's voice is a little different.. he sounds older (because he IS omg!!1) But Wade and Dallas still do some singing (entire songs too omggg!!11!) and they sound even better than the last album. I'd say if you are a fan of Alexisonfire, or just someone looking to buy a good album, then pick this up. 4 out of 5, just because so far, I liked the last album a little bit more."
4,Less George by popular demand,"I can't count the amount of times I've heard people complain about George's vocals. Those people are obviously not real fans. However, the band must have taken those complaints to heart because this newer effort from the band features much less from George and a lot more from Dallas. While I like Dallas' vocals, they're only good in small doses, and they kind of drag on for too long during some songs.Don't get me wrong though, this is by no means a bad CD, the sonic guitar riffs and the heart pounding drums make up for it. I think all of the tracks are great, just some take more getting used to than others. My overall favorite tracks are ""Hey, It's Your Funeral Mama"", ""No Transistory"" and ""That Girl Possesed""."
2,wats going on?,"i'm really not too sure about this. i mean, on their last record, alexisonfire proved that they were the best in business. emocore with a real power and some of the best guitar lines you'll ever hear. with this record, they totally change their sound. not too good. especially the way george's vocals sound, its just terrible. sorry guys, but if you liked the first record, this one is a HUGE disappointment. although, if you were one of the many who thought they could do with less screaming, more singing and slower songs...i guess you'll love this."
2,Cramped & Hard to Use,"I admit I'm not using it for cymbals -- I'm using it for a round Scrabble board. But I USED to be a drummer and I can't imagine it could be useful. It could possibly hold 2, MAYBE 3 cymbals. The side pocket is similarly cramped & hard to use. How many accessories could you possibly put it in? It was cheap, but I wish I'd never bought it. It does seem sturdy, but barely holds even the few things I put it in, and never anything extra."
3,Nice features for the price.,"These are a bit cheap-looking but since I got them for walking my dogs they're fine. There are two nice features that set these everyday sneaks apart, tuckable lacing and interchangable, multicolored side logos."
5,Phenomenal resource,This book is destined to become a classic. It is full of such useful information. Not only is the content fantastic but the format is an outstanding feature of the book. I predict many will read it and all of those will value it and refer to it often. Thanks for providing us with such a comprehensive and easy to use resource.
5,Well Made and Easy to Use Travel System!,"My husband and I registered for this travel system after trying out many other travel systems at Babies R' Us, including Peg Perego and Graco. So far we are very happy with our decision.The car seat base is very easy to install (we used the keyfit option) and the car seat latches easily and securely in place. The stroller folds very easily and, while it is not the lightest out there, is very maneuverable and sturdy.We also like the neutral colors - not too ""babyish"" or trendy and suitable for a boy or girl."
4,Doesn't work in a grocery cart!,"We bought this stroller and loved every aspect until I headed grocery shopping! The infant carrier doesn't have the slots that allow it to fit in the 'sitting part' of the grocery cart. This also prevents it from working in some resturants' infant carrier holders. Otherwise, I love it! My favorite part is the infant insert to keep her head from bouncing around!"
4,All in one and easy to fold up.,"We chose this combo set for a couple of reasons: #1 It is the easiest to set up or fold up, it is basically just one click. #2 It is relatively light, given its large size. Some the of the other models we have looked at are a bit ligthter or have a few extra gadgets, but this model fit what we needed - EASY and LIGHT..."
5,"This travel system is great. We are not only just travel with it, but also use it in house.","This travel system is great. We brought the stroller and car seat to travel with us three times before my daughter turned to 1 year old. Although it's a bit heavy to carry it, my daughter likes to sit or lay there to sleep. When my daughter was sick around 10 month - 11 month old, her nanny took the stroller inside the house, so my daughter would take her nap there. Sometimes, she even slept in it through the whole night, since she would not stay in her own bed at the time. It helped us to pass that difficult time."
2,This is a Fabulous System! The more we use it the more we like it.,"I have to say that we absolutely love the look and style of this travel system. Great Fabric, sleek design, tons of great features. We have used it for 6 months now and I think it is a fabulous system. The car seat is the best and one of the safest on the market. Easy and comfy for the baby. The stroller is still bulky but not near as bad as Graco or some of the giant evenflos. The only thing I was unhappy with was, unlike many of the other major brands, Chicco does not make the carseat compatible to click into a shopping cart, I guess they don't recommend it anyway but it is difficult to do shopping with any type of carts. I tried to edit the reveiew and change it to 5 stars but it won't let me. So although it says 2 stars we think it is a 5 star purchase, and a definite must have. We have owned many strollers over the years (through 3 kids) but this is the best. :O)"
2,Not an original filter,"I thought I was getting an original Honeywell filter. This ""replacement"" filter looks to be only half as good as the Honeywell filter it replaced. I will make sure I get a Honeywell next time."
2,It is not Honeywell.,"It is not an official Honeywell filter as another reviewer saidalthough it sounds it is. For this kind of compatible filter,you can find cheaper price in other places. It is misleading.The quality of the filter is ok."
1,I didn't receive a honeywell,"From the product description: ""Honeywell 24000 Replacement HEPA Filter"", ""Genuine HoneywellTrue HEPA filter"" I did not receive a Honeywell, I received a ""RPS BestAir"" filter clone. Outright misleading listing.Seller: Allergy Be Gone"
4,older models,Just opened my Honeywell Envirocare model 13503 located on sticker on bottom. There is also a sticker on the top that says Filter 24000. Prefilter 33002 I believe.
2,More an ad for wine than a real history,"While there are certainly some interesting facts, and I tend to agree with many of the numerous opinions of the author about prohibition of any sort, far too much of the book focuses on his obvious preference for wine over all other drinks and his obvious disdain for spirits. He even has a piece where he talks about British wine snobs in an unfavorable light, but then concludes with one of the snobbiest British interpretations of American culture I can imagine. If you are going to write about American drinking culture and history, try to address it without such an obvious bias or you do nothing but confirm the reasons the majority of Americans don't like wine as much as you think they should.There are other books on the topic that are more approachable and less snobby, get one of those unless you are a wine snob and want to have your opinions confirmed by a foreigner."
2,2.5 stars,"This book was okay. The information was interesting and the writing flowed fairly well, but the author definitely needed to do a lot more editing. I also found the author's constant interjection of opinions to be irritating. Even if I agree with the author, I just want the facts and should be able to make up my own mind. Also, the insane number of footnotes that only stated ""this was covered or will be covered in another chapter in more detail"" were completely uneccessary. Just let me read the book and the information should unfold."
4,Fairbanks at his height,"This really qualifies as an epic, even though it is silent. Amazing special effects, excellent pirate costumes, a cast of characters that you wouldn't want to meet in broad daylight much less a dark alley. Very well acted, with a reasonably coherent plot. Also some underwater sequences that rival James Bond's! Fairbanks' acrobatics are terrific. One caution: you might be surprised at the goriness of some of the scenes, or what is assumed to take place off camera."
4,Classic Swashbuckler,"I have been fortunate to see this film 3 times on the big screen and it is certainly the finest example of a Two-Strip Technicolor silent film still extant. The restored print is first rate and captures the subtle look that Fairbanks wanted. Fairbanks is at his finest and this film contains the famous stunt of plunging his knife into the mainsail and gracefully sliding to safety. However, it is fair to note that this film moves noticeably slower than the other Fairbanks swashbucklers of this era but it is still first rate entertainment and much emulated by the likes of Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power and Burt Lancaster (""The Crimson Pirate"") Highly Recommended."
1,Not What It's Cracked Up To Be,"As far as a pirate movie, no holds barred, it's a classic. As far as a restoration of a classic movie: PUH-LEEEEEEEZ! Words that are not expletives cannot properly describe my disappointment when I popped my newly-purchased copy into the player and sat down to watch what had been SO improperly billed as a first-rate restoration of an amazing example of early Technicolor magic. It ain't even good black and white! The guys at Kino should be forced to buy every copy of this movie back at 10 times the advertised selling price, grind 'em all up and then EAT them! This so-called restoration was so poorly crafted, I couldn't even enjoy the movie for its own sake. I can't even resell this fiasco for the possible offending of my own conscience! FOR YOUR OWN SAKES, RENT THIS SUCKER FIRST IF YOUR'E CONSIDERING PURCHASING IT!"
3,Platoon,"I have seen this film but it was many years ago, when myself and a friend used to rent videos from the local store and there were certain ones we would rent again and again.This film (Along with ""Trick or Treat"" & ""Killer Clowns from Outer Space"") was one of the few that we could watch umpteen times without getting sick of it.It may have been the ""implied"" vampirism, as we were big horror fans, or just that at the time we were into war films (""Platoon"", ""Jacob's Ladder"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", that sort of thing)"
3,Good But Far From His Best,"Certainly this album includes great artists (Roy Hargrove, Abby Lincoln and the great George Cables playing piano) but for me, the whole thing just didn't seem to work overall.For an introduction to Frank Morgan, try ""Listen to the Dawn"" or ""Love, Lost and Found"", where you'll hear Cedar Walton, Kenney Burrell, Ron Carter, Ray Brown and others, where ballads are more in evidence, the arrangements are tighter and the music seems to flow more in the same diection."
2,Big Disappointment...,"A 60 minute DVD about the ""Last Stand"" should include more than fifteen minutes on the famous battle. The problem here is that the viewer has to sit through over fifty minutes on the how and why problems of frontier America which led to the famous battle. If I buy a documentary on the Battle of the Little Big Horn I want it to be about the battle of the LBH and not have a social and political agenda which is prevalent among PBS documentaries. Save your money and find a copy of ""Custer's Last Trooper."" Much more interesting."
3,ONE TIME VIEWING,"THE DVD IS A GOOD QUALITY AND IS WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT IT IS A ONE TIME VIEWING. IF YOU CAN RENT IT SOME PLACE, YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF THAN BUYING IT. SERVICE FROM THE SITE WAS QUICK WITH JUST STANDARD SHIPPING. I WILL BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE."
2,Not So Great...,"This DVD wasn't what I was looking for. I've taken Tai Chi classes for about a year now and wanted a DVD that I could use when I can't go to class (vacations, etc.). I wanted a 30-60 minute routine I could do along with the DVD. This is a very slow-moving DVD that shows (in very slow detail) the correct form for just the first 12 or so moves. It's only at the end that it goes through all the first 12 moves, but doesn't touch on all the rest of the moves. I guess I needed to purchase the next DVD up in the series... or something...I would only want this DVD if I'd never done Tai Chi before and wanted detailed lessons on how to do the very beginning moves."
4,fun game,We wanted this version of the game because of the bigger playing board. we were happy with the size but disappointed that it was folded up and does not unfold flat on the table because it is not a hard board it is vynal with a foam back and does not lay out flat. other than that it is a great game and a lot of fun for everyone in the family.
5,Jumbo Sequence Review,Jumbo Sequence is an awesome game! It is so much fun. It works your brain tremendously. The whole family can play. The mat is large enough for 6 people to play and you can see the cards on it better than on the original Sequence. We stay up all hours of the night playing and my 73 year old mother loves it. She wants to play it daily!
5,A great game!,"The people who criticize that this game comes down to luck don't understand game theory, hand reading, or the fact that nearly every game outside of chess has a ton of luck in it. Poker, Scrabble, Yahtzee are a mix of luck and strategy. You will find that here as well. You will find bad players who use their Jacks as soon as you get them. You may get good enough to hand read your opponents hand assuming he is making optimal plays and you can adapt by playing optimally as well."
1,No Strategy just luck,"This game is rather boring. There is very little strategy as the players merely put markers based on the cards they are holding. If you have the ""blocking"" card then good for you. If you don't then you lose. Wow, how much fun is that. I have been forced to play the game many times but would rather do anything else."
5,No need for the bothersome reading glasses!,Large Sequence mat makes this game easy on the eyes. It is easy to learn and fun for couples. Enclosed directions are quite clear.
4,Great for senior citizens!,"I had played this game on its regular board and knew that it was a bit difficult to see everything. This jumbo sized mat solves that problem for sure but it is big so you need to make sure your table can accommodate it. There is also a bit of an issue in that the mat doesn't lay flat. An actual jumbo board might be better. Still, it's a great game and I highly recommend it."
4,Easy to play,Deluxe SequenceWe bought the smaller version of the game originally and found it was hard to see the cards on the board. We then bought the larger game with the mat and it has reduced the eye strain tremendously. The game is easy to play and even the kids enjoy it.
5,Jumbo Sequence,"Excellent game for all ages! This is our second game,we also have the regular board game. We started playing Sequence one Thanksgiving at my aunt and uncle's house, the whole family became hooked. The day after Thanksgiving everyone was at the store buying their own game! We started having Sequence ""tournaments"". During the holidays we had a ""game party"" with various games going on;everyone kept making their way over to the Sequence table,we now have another group of people hooked on the game!"
5,Jumbo Sequence Box Edition,"I Love the Jumbo board! Easy to see from all sides.This game is fun for two. My husband, who does not like games as a rule, is now playing Sequence with me in the evenings.This is fun with other adults as well as with children or a mix of all ages."
5,Good for large group,This jumbo edition of Sequence is so much easier to play with more than two players because it is much easier to see the playing surface and allows more space for players to get around the game.
5,It's Fun for Everyone!,"I'm part of a group of women aged 50+ and we love the game! I bought the box version of the game, but it was difficult to play with the creases. I folded it backwards and rolled it, put it in a tube, and now we've got the perfect game!!"
5,Great fun for all the family.,This is the second Sequence game we have bought. The first is the standard size and is ideal for a small table with 4 or 6 players. We bought the Jumbo Sequence to make it easier to see for more players or a larger table. We would thoroughly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys social evenings of games rather than watching the TV.
5,She's The One,"This has to be The Best Female Vocal musical event of the 90's . Perfect . Softer than Sara , clearer than Carmen , intimater than Natalie . Love her . Perfect compositions for a perfect delivery ..."
2,boooooring!,Just one word: boring. you could not tell if shirley horn is singing or reciting a poem. It has some sonic benefits though. recording was good. But that's about it. Diana Krall is so much better. Save your money look for something else.
5,A favorite,"Shirley Horn has been a favorite of mine for many years. This release is another fine example of her sensitivity to the genre, the soft caress of her piano and the whisper of her voice lull you into her world. An extremely pleasurable listening experience."
2,Better routes available for free,"There's some interesting scenery here but on the whole this route and the rolling stock are far inferior to most of the freeware routes available on the internet. Go to train-sim.com and look around. There are also much better payware routes, made by people who truly care about trains. Check out Sandpatch, Cajon Pass, Protrains 2 and many others."
4,A Well Done Add On,"The landscape is very well done with lots of scenery items to look at. The layout of the track is excellent and provides for a whole lot of switching action. There are several long grades to test your skill at speed control. I had no problems installing or using the program. The only downside is that there is only one type of locomotive included. You get several road numbers, but they are all sd40's. The cab is a basic rework of the default gp-38. The sound is well done also. Overall an excellent product."
4,"all sand, no ocean","i've got to fly to el paso, rent a car, and drive up to white sands. a plan for years, but never went, so far..so i watch the movie again.great rourke, a favorite from so many other movies, and samuel jackson when i still thought he was related to the general.weird plot, varied characters, violence and sex, with at least one indian, and a bunch of horses. those who are more or less clean survive, the evil doers perish. nice and straightforeward. a western with the good guy in a white hat and corvette. the girl rich and with horses. samuel jackson with white sand.it all adds up to a good time, well worth the popcorn and pepsi.think i'll get another pepsi, it's dry out here.........."
4,Interesting mix that delivers entertainment value,"An early 1990s effort directed by NZ director Roger Donaldson (Species etc....) with great cast of William Dafoe in an early lead role as a local sherif who lets his enthusiasm to solve a murder lead to impersonating a dead FBI agent; Mickey Rourke as gum chewing and nattily dressed villain (not too different from his few ""good guy"" roles now I think of it!); an affluent femme fatale with a difference in Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Sam Jackson as a wild card FBI operative, plus a well scripted multiple double crossing story that keeps you guessing till the end, all beautifully filmed in New Mexico, a part of the USA I still think is amazing for its natural scenery.I completely missed this on release but purchased the DVD in a clearance sale and would strongly recommend as a take it easy, night in watch. While not a 5 star movie the chemistry of all the above parts still makes for high value entertainment."
2,great cast no logic,"We have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there. There is no rhyme or reason to the story. I gave it two stars because the landscape is great."
4,Excellent thriller with superb cast,"This smart thriller makes you both wonder what gonna happend next and be suprised that Mickey Rourke is good. Samuel Jackson, Willem Dafoe and M Emmet Walsh is all good. But it is Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio who steals the show. Her best since ""The Abyss"". If you like this movie, check out ""Thunderheart"", ""Consenting Adults"" and ""Unlawful Entry""."
2,CONFUSING AND OVERACTED,So-so fare of a lawman finding a corpse and gathering evidence of it being connected to the FBI and a narcotics case; elements don't always click in this one.
3,decent fiction,"Gedhill's fictional history of his career in the RLI was enjoyable.... and his style storytelling certainly fits the genre of the 70-80s ""soldier of fortune"" war story. That being said I enjoyed the book and am delighted to have it in my library on the Rhodesian conflict. I would recommed having Chris Cocks's Fire Force along with it to balance the perspective of Mr. Gedhill's book."
2,I CONQURE THE SEA,"I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED IN IT FOR A SEA GOING PICURE.AND BAD FOR A PART THAT DOES NOT SUIT THE ACTOR DENNIS MORGAN AFTER BEING IN SUCH GOOD MUSICALS OF THE 40S.AND 50S, HE AS ALSO BEEN IN SOME VERY GOOD WESTERNS, I LIKE DINNIS VERY MUSH AND ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO SEE HIS MOVIES. BUT THIS ONE IS NOT VERY GOOD . IT GIVES A PAUSE IN MOST PARTS OF THE MOVIE WITH STOPS FORJUST A FEW SECONDS. THE SOUND IS DOWN IN SOME PARTS . BUT IT IS A GOOD MOVIE FOR THE STORY AND THE ACTING , DENNIS IS THE BEST IN IT. BUT ASHAME HE DID NOT DO MORE SINGING , HE ONLY DOES ABOUT TWO SONGS. SORRY HAD TO RETURN IT BUT EXSPECT TO FIND A MUCH BETTER FILM AND THERE AGAIN IT WAS MADE BY ALPHA, SO THAT WILL ACCOUNT FOR IT.. WOULD NOW BE LOOKING FOR MORE GOOD MOVIES OF DENNIS MORGAN ON DVD"
2,YAWN!,"I have been purchasing rental houses for going on 2 years. If I had read this book first, I think I would have kept my money in the bank. Eldred makes me feel that real estate investing is way too complicated to even start. Granted, there are those writers who make it seem all too easy, but Eldred throws up so many cautions as to scare the average investor away.He may tour the US giving seminars on investing, but the book seems to have been written for rich investors. He gives very little details on how to do a deal. He declines to outline his plan for the reason that every city is different. While this is in essence true, it would be helpful to an investor to have some plan, any plan upon which to start his or her real estate investing career.I did glean some info from it, but that was because I was interested in a very narrow sphere of real estate. For that reason I gave it 2 stars."
2,Small Income Properties,"If you are looking for a how to guide this is not the book. Eldred, gives you a very high level overview of the real estate game."
5,John Prine - Live from Sessions ot West 54th,"jClap, Clap, MORE, Clap, Clap, MORE. As you can see I am a John Pine fan.Could not be better than this. Now he needs to update."
4,"Good one, John!","This concert was a bit shaky at first, with poor sound quality, but once it got going and you got into it, it really hit its straps and you just got to love it. Prine is very good and his back-up musicians are excellent. The small venue makes a big difference with concerts like this. The five songs he sings with Iris Dement gives you a good look at the fascinating Ms Dement. If you are a fan of JP, you should love this."
5,Interesting and good,My dad wanted this dvd. I had not heard of John Prine. It was quite entertaining. John Prine is an excellent songwriter. This dvd is for an audience open to laid-back storytelling music. The filming was wonderful.
3,Disappointed Fan,"I have no doubt that I would be able to give this product a reasonable review but, because of poor packaging, the notes have disappeared. I rely on extensive notes to provide background when broadcasting to the five East Dorset hospitals and consequently very disappointed with something which doesn't provide the usual standard expected by the buying public."
4,Fun book for free.,Makes you think about the redundancy of words in everyday phrases - especially over used phrases perpetuated in the Media. Kindle format was hard to read - few words on each page with confusing separation between items.
5,A sudden epiphany of insightful enlightenment.,Even an English major will be caught in this hilarious net of those things we say without considering their meaning. Well worth it if it just makes you pause before uttering that next phrase or hitting the send button.
3,Fun for a short dip now and again. Keep it near you whenever you are forced to listen to the news!,"Unfortunately, too many people talk and write this way! Guaranteed to amuse and infuriate lovers of language and clear speaking"
2,Totally Boring,I am very glad that this was a Kindle freebie.It was one of the most boring books I have read this year.The dictionary is more interesting.
3,Nice try,"I read this effort with combined amusement and horror, horror as I counted up the ones I've probably used on occasion. Of course, my uses always had some point. Didn't they? Perhaps it's just denial talking.With one exception. I'll never accept 'inflammable' as redundant. What we have here are the half-literate come full circle to bite the fully literate in the tail. Or perhaps it's merely more evidence, were any needed, the time has come for those with classical educations to give up and go extinct.My general criticism is that the list of redundancies seems padded. Would anybody really say, ""New beginner""? Okay, someone might, but no one motivated to buy this book. There are many of that kind. Other examples, such as ""Sworn affidavit,"" have technical meanings that are pretty much their only use.Still, it's a good effort. The fight against flabby thinking is never-ending. This is certainly a well-meaning salvo in the war."
3,Not what I was expecting,Got this book thinking hey it'll be full of humorous tidbits and I was completely wrong. Just plain dreadful .
3,Interesting,This book was interesting and informative. It kinda makes one think about how you say things and what they mean.
3,Too much of a good thing,"I enjoyed it, am glad I downloaded it, and would do so again. The caveat is that it's just a bit much of an amusing thing. It became a bit tedious for me. But certainly worth a looky-loo, and perhaps a return to later for more of the same."
1,BORING!,I couldn't get half way through this book and I had to get rid of it. Absolutely boring! Don't waste your money.
3,"Some parts Fun, Some parts ho-hum","This book was worth the price (free). It was quite short, which was something of a relief, as I found it got just a bit tedious after the first dozen pages or so. It took me less than an hour to finish. I didn't time it, so I can't tell you how much less.Don't get me wrong, it's quite well-written, and it is exactly as advertised. It's just too much of the same type thing. The author would come up with a redundant phrase (isn't there a word for a phrase of two words?), and plug it into his formula for description and close relatives.I learned a few things about these fun language hiccups, but it is put together more like an academic paper and less like something that would be fun to read. I think I was hoping for something more fun to read."
1,Koolatron Doesn't Cool,"We received one for Christmas. We are white wine and champagne drinkers. The product is tauted to cool to 44*F. Filled with 6 bottles of white and running all night, it could not cool below 57*, although set to lower temperature to 44*. This is useless for white wine drinkers, perhaps o.k. for reds drinkers or English beers.We got a replacement the next day. Set for 44*, it quickly lowered its temperature from 74* to 63*, then slowly lowered to 53*, at which point it went no lower at all. This is useless for our purposes, or for any persons who enjoy white wines chilled. I highly recommend the traditionalmethod of an ice bucket over this product, and at prices as low as a pail with some ice and water.Looks great!! Product stinks."
1,Don't waste your money,"I received as a Christmas gift. It is too bulky for the countertop unless placed at an angle. It is loud and is not powerful enough to chill six bottles of wine. It finally just quit working and after it leaked all over the place, I threw it in the garbage."
2,Useless,"Too old fashioned for my taste, and too much story telling. I didn't feel like making any recipe. Not attractive at all."
4,A quick and enjoyable read,"I found this to be a fairly enjoyable, quick read about battling bipolar disorder. The quality of writing is pretty good and the story inspires empathy in the reader. Like another reviewer said, it did have a little too much God in it for my taste. Nonetheless, it makes a significant contribution to the genre of mental illness memoirs and is worth reading if you suffer from bipolar disorder or know someone who does. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
4,The only non-5 star book of the 8-book series.,"This is an interesting and compelling read, and a necessary part of the Kent family chronicles. It's kind of a bummer, though, as absolutely nothing good happens to anyone for over 500 pages. I guess you could call it brilliant but depressing, if that makes sense."
2,History 101,"John Jakes writes in an easy-to-read style, however I found myself skipping pages, which I never do.Too much history, battles and blood, not enough characters and interpersonal intrigue.Instead I recommend his ""North and South"" trilogy. Even if you don't like it, at least you only have to read 3 books instead of 8."
5,Rebels,"This is my favorite period of time in history and Mr. Jakes did an excellent job of portraying the ""period"""
3,Entertaining fluff,"As with the first book, The Bastard, this is entertaining, but not historically rich or particularly well written. It is worth reading if you want a good story that has period atmosphere to it."
2,I got 2 of them,"one book was ok, and it was just fine. I did not need 2 books although both books looked good."
4,Purists Beware,"This release is receiving a wild mix of reviews (as opposed to mixed reviews) out there. RS gave it four stars. Down Beat offered only three.I've got absolutely no problem with jazz musicians using contemporary pop and rock songs as the basis for improvisation. And Mehldau is perhaps the last hope for seeing that work in the post-rock era.Compared to Herbie Hancock's ""New Standard"" with its endless, virtuoustic flights of masturbatory noodling, Mehldau's interpretations of admittedly simple source material such as Radiohead and Beatles tunes offers a whole new way of *hearing* the music.It is art in this respect. And who else in jazz is bringing us this gift?"
5,Best fusion album in a while,I love this album. I am a big time Brad follower. I have seen him play at the Jazzaldia in San Sebastian. I love his trio albums and his innovative approach to piano. And I LOVE this album. I think it is one of the best fusion albums in a while. It is different from other fusion music but it is beautiful and sounds great to my ears. Here you will find some pop songs Brad treats as standards and the addition of horns makes his music more fun. Thanks Brad for this wonderful recording.
3,Merely Fine,"Unfortunately, even though I am a big fan of Mehldau's work (esp., Progression and Elegiac Cycle) I agree with some of the critics this time.Largo is a bit disappointing. Brad shines on his previous trio work. I like the idea that he's trying some Pop tunes (e.g., Radiohead, Beatles). There are some moments of depth and intropsection here, but the strings and (especially) the horns accompaniment is weak and often doesn't work well. The additional personnel confuses communication. Overall, the courageous move to pop integration and mixing (and production) is less than successful. In brief, there are lessons to be learned from Miles' experiments with fusion.I recommend Progression over Largo."
5,I only know what I like - and I like this CD.,"I bought this CD on the strength of a glowing review in the Boston Globe newspaper. I knew absolutely nothing about this artist, except that I was familiar with Jon Brion's work with Aimee Mann. I took a chance...and it paid off over several listens and is now played on a daily basis."
4,Nice and Sweet Jazz,I've learned to like this album once I got passed the Radiohead cover of Paranoid Android. My problem with that is that PA is not the nice and sweet tune it is made out. That same approach given to Dear Prudence works; and it works damn well. But having said that I have learned to appreciate his version of PA.His other works are very good and I can easily recommend the album based on them.I think my next purchase will his Live Trio which comes highly recommended.
1,A Major Disappointment,"As a fan of Mehldau since his early days with Joshua Redman and his releases prior to the ""Art of the Trio"" series, I have always thought him to be a spectacular player with a unique approach to improvisation and composition. Seeing him live is a great experience: he's as technically proficient as they come, and his improvisations at times seem to be practically through-composed. ""Largo"" shocked me. I haven't purchased such a piece of garbage in years. By hiring a rock personel he's shifted the direction, which could be a good thing, but isn't in this case. Each tune drones on and goes nowhere, and his introduction of vibes makes it even worse. If you're a Mehldau fan, don't buy this cd without listening to it first! Spend the money on a Jarrett or Calderazzo cd."
2,Mehldau's Worst,"I'm a fan of Brad Mehldau; he's an inventive pianist with good chops. Nonetheless Largo stinks for the following reasons: 1. The horn arrangements were musically unexpressive. They evoked neither emotion or interest and distracted me from the piano playing. Superfluous, cheezy, and annoying. 2. Mehldau's improvisations were inhibited. His playing was not as interesting or moving as on trio albums. 3. While I sometimes enjoy ""jam band"" and fusion albums, Mehldau doesn't sound good in that type of setting, at least on this album. Again, his playing is unexpressive.Largo isn't all bad. My favorite track was Dear Prudence; the tune sounded pretty in a jazz setting, and Mehldau played simple eloquent lines. But my overall opinion is that Largo is an overproduced cheap shot for a few extra bucks. Instead, I suggest ""Introducing Brad Mehldau"" or ""Art of the Trio: Vol 1."""
1,dont buy this if you like real jazz,"some of the previous reviewers were spot on, others clueless. to begin, i'd like to state that if you love brads art of trio series, you'll be in for an unpleasant surprise on this one. they play it alot on the music choice jazz station, however, it actually belongs on the smooth jazz station! he uses either a drum machine(unacceptable in jazz)or its a gorilla-fisted drummer. brads lines are simple and uninteresting, and his vibe playing is laughable! i absolutely love his older work, but this cd it really terrible! by the way, i still hate the pop-jazz that miles [pushed] out in the 80's and early 90's. if i want to hear simple, uninspired music, i'll just turn on MTV, at least you get to see nice boobies"
5,Yet another groundbreaker from Mehldau,"This guy never ceases to amaze me. He's a brilliant pianist in every aspect of music. His amazing technical facility, his ability to convey emotion, and his intricate brain dancing all send me into violent orjazzms. He has a very clear identity, a great foundation, and an artistic brain always looking to create...and all of this shows on the new one. He has broken ground with previous albums, but nothing really is as daring as Largo. I think it's a remarkable effort, and has a remarkable sound; however, Brad may lose some fans, as well as gaining new ones from this album.As well as Brad, I particularly enjoyed drummer Matt Chamberlain on this CD. It's a five star album as far as I am concerned."
2,BOOORRRRING...,"Well, ok, Mehldau's arrangements aren't bad...He does a great version of ""Paranoid Android"" but otherwise...WHERE'S THE ENERGY? There's really not a whole lot of excitement or energy in this album, and I do understand this as being a more laid back, mellowed-out album...but it is still possible to be more exciting, energetic, or emotional in this style. All three of these things are pretty much absent from this CD which ends up making it dull. :yawn:"
5,Almost definitely recommended,"I have found this book almost as useful and interesting as the LaTeX Companion. I think that it gives enough information about sharing TeX and LaTeX texts on the web, but the chapters covering pdfTeX and SGML/XML applications could be more detailed.I have found that there is another big problem - with every day coming the information tends to get older and older. I can fully recommend buying this book today, but I am not sure if I would do it once more after half a year has passed.If you were interested in transforming TeX into PDF, I would recommend also the LaTeX Graphics Companion, or some other book introducing the problematic of PostScript and PDF."
2,Where's the color?,"Not a bad western, with a good cast of character actors. The problem is the picture quality isn't very good(although certainly watchable) but this is a black and white print of a color film."
4,Not Like I Remember But Still Listenable,I really liked this album when it came out in the seventies. It is well produced but today sounds dated. One thing that hasn't changed for me though is the fact that Steve Miller's lyrics sound as silly today as they did thirty years. A must though for Steve Miller fans.
4,studio Miller,"While live Steve Miller is a LOT better in my opinion (because of his willingness to experiment with creative ways to alter many of his songs) this is still a pretty decent album in its own right.""Swingtown"" and ""The Stake"" are the highlights for me, with the dreaminess of the former and the Joe Walsh-like guitar playing of the latter. ""True Fine Love"" is a good vocal melody track, and ""Jungle Love ""deserved to be a major hit because of its immediately likeable pop sound.The only bad song is ""Jet Airliner"" which features a verse melody that drags clumsily (and rather annoyingly too). Steve Miller never had a perfect album though, but this is probably the best of his popular mid to late 70's period."
5,Sacrifice,"James ""Curley"" Cooke penned ""Sacrifice"". I know this as a personal and a family fact. It is a diamond; Jim is a gem."
5,Jet Airliner guitar solo,"This album has the best version of Jet Airliner- the one with the long, driving guitar intro."
5,young childrens classic,"At least around my house, this is a classic for young children. My own kids grew up with it, and I bought this copy for my grandson. I'd be remiss if I let him grow up without it!"
5,"Fantastic, But When Is The DVD Coming Out?","There's not really much I could say that already hasn't been said about this incredible live double-CD. It is a MUST HAVE if you are a Kraftwerk fan. Of course, everybody has favorites they wish were on here; ie. Showroom Dummies, Europe Endless, etc. but you just can't have everything. NOW, all I want to know when is the double-DVD coming out that is mentioned on their official website? Since I've NEVER had the pleasure of seeing Kraftwerk live (When I lived in Atlanta they were supposed to come, but cancelled their tour before they got there!), I'm really looking forward to the DVD! Anybody know anything about it?"
4,Maybe you've heard of Kraftwerk...,"maybe you've heard of Kraftwerk, every once in awhile they're mentioned and you never really quite heard their music. They have a library of albums in their thirty-odd years composing electronic music and influencing all genres from hip-hop to techno. This is the brief history of Kraftwerk, now go listen to this album to learn all the basics. The latest from über-electronica giants is a live compilation, but an excellent primer for the uninitiated. It'll get you feeling all 80's while widening your ear palette to take on more of their sounds. This 2 disc set is perfect even if you already own a bunch of their albums. The sounds are clean and nostalgic and stubbornly remain their glitchy monolithic kraftwerkness. (originally published in WAV Magazine - Progressive Music Art Politics Culture www.wavmag.com)"
3,Too bad you can't just by Disc 2...,"...because Disc 1 is pretty tired. Now that the price is $5 less than I just freakin' paid for it, might be worth it. Disc 2 is very good, not nearly as 'dated' sounding at Disc 1. A much tighter and more compelling line up of tracks."
3,Ok.It's Ok.,"I'm sorry to say that I am not buying this.The live songs are good BUT,I would rather have the album original Non-live ones.Well,still it's just ok.It's all good."
5,2nd only to being there,Kraftwerk appeared very little in North America for their 2004 2005 concerts. I was able to attend three separate concerts. This isn't as good as being there but this is the actual 2004-2005 concert song list as it was in the concerts! Sound quality is great on the CD. Get it now! Kraftwerk rocks on!!!
5,Spank You Very Much,"I've been a Kraftwerk fan for 36 years. I took my family to see them live in Seattle about 8 months ago. I was overwhelmed. They initially thought dear old dad was nuts to take them to the concert. By concert's end, they too had become Kraftwerk fans. This live CD is amazing. I am not a fan of most live CD's since the tunes usually don't sound as great as the studio versions. This is just terrific. If you're a fan of techno-rock......these are the guys who started it all. They've basically influenced almost every rock band on planet Earth. These are the guys..........listen and be amazed."
2,aki ross,"The eye piece come of when I was taking it out of the box . Where the neck meets the body it is too thick not a smooth joint like other dolls. The body is too skinny or her uniform is too big, it just doesn't seem to fit right."
1,not so childish fixture,"We purchased this light fixture for our kids room.The glass material cracked at installation where the red cone attached to the glass, it was too fragile. We installed a dozen lighting fixtures and this was the only one that cracked. The cone covers the class crack but led us to believe that this is too fragile to install in a kids room or anywhere else.We are replacing it, plus the color is full, not vibrant as you would expect."
5,A terrific book for vacation planning,"This is the best book for snorkeling I've ever found. The other books are so vague, they don't tell me much of anything. This one describes all the neat places to walk in from the beach and go snorkeling, how rough or calm the area is, how to get to various snorkeling beaches once I get there, whether the kids can safely swim in each area. It also has all the resorts that have snorkeling off their beaches, which is really nice for people traveling with small children and the airlines and travel stuff we need."
4,useful guide,"This new book has a lot of useful tips, a wide variety of places to choose from, and many web sites and e-mail addresses. This will help you find the best place for your vacation."
1,What a wretched game,"I'm glad to see others have written bad reviews for this game, as it means I won't have to write as much. The only decent thing about Jazz and Faust is the graphics. Everything else was terrible, especially the dialogue and gameplay. Faust sounds like a sedated cow, and says inane things such as ""What a splendid fish!"" and ""Does nobody sweep the stairs?"". The puzzles and problems were either simple enough for a 5 year old, or else made no sense at all. Furthermore, you couldn't solve problems or pick up items until you had spoken to the right person, even if you had figured things out beforehand. I plan on selling this game this week, although I am toying with the idea of setting it on fire. It certainly deserves it. I must concur with other reviewers, any Monkey Island game would be a much much much better investment than Jazz and Faust."
1,"Sorry, this is too juvenile","So now we know there is Muzak in the sailing ship era. Everything about this game is awful, starting with the music. Following comes more bad news, the install is flukey, and the voice acting is Kenau Reaves quality, if you get my drift.Everything about this game might appeal to a 12 year old, who has never played an adventure game before, but Jazz and Faust is too stupid to even continue talking about.Save your money, I wish I had."
1,Horrible,"[This game wasn't worth the money I paid for it]. Horrible dialogue. This game makes NO SENSE!!! I got halfway through just curious what the ending would be, but I just can't bring myself to waste the time in finishing it. Only positive thing is the background graphics were ok."
1,outstanding film; technically horrible dvd,"""Solas"" is -- hands down -- an outstanding film that paints a realistic portrait of some of the contemporary issues in Spanish culture. This version of the DVD, however, is totally worthless. For one, the presentation is a poorly mastered 4:3, with a large, distracting black bar running along one side of the screen. The sound is nothing special (2 channel), and it is impossible to turn off the subtitles, which is annoying if you speak Spanish and don't want to look at them. There are no extras beyond a few trailers. Overall, this DVD does not do this incredible film justice, especially when you factor in its relatively high cost. This is an unfortunate delivery system for a brilliant film."
5,family you can't pick them but if you could,This is a great foreign film! The characters are flawed yet strong and this film proves that just sometimes you get a second chance and can pick your family members. The main character has a troubled relationship with both parents but loves her mother in spite of what she sees as weakness. Her father is another story and in the end the main character gets to finally have a father figure that she and her mother both would have loved. I loved this film perhaps the most because I myself have learned over the years that what we're born into and what we would have picked are vastly different. The acting is strong and believable. I recommend this to everyone.
4,good,"I would recommend reading this miniatlas, interesting information to read about, and if you are interested in international -global politics."
3,Kenny Burrell saves the day,"The first five tracks on this album (what would have been Side 1 on the vinyl) are rather pedestrian readings. Ms. Dearie doesn't display her usual wit with her singing. The next five tracks (Side 2) when Mr. Burrell is added on seems to perk up everybody, especially Blossom, especially if you program the CD to start the five tracks with #8 which is more in line with the actual recording dates as claimed in the liner notes."
2,From Back Cover,"I remember the day when my life began to spin out of control...Without going into too much detail, it was the day that a birthday cake, a very naughty gift, an incredible one-night stand and a ""cover curse"" at the magazine I work for all came together....Now I'm heading to Nowheresville, U.S.A., to man-sit Sam Long, the hunky veterinarian I slept with last night, all under the cover of a job assignment! How I'm supposed to maintain a professional distance at this point is totally beyond me! But my career (and his safety) depend upon it. Since I've never left New York City, I guess I should look at this as an adventure. I can only hope that while I'm out covering my job (and my boss's behind), someone will cover me. And if I play my cards right, that person might just be Sam...."
4,Happy Mother,I purchased this item for my 7th grade daughter to assist her in math. This is a study guide that has helped her to review and get a head start on her school work. It gives step by step examples for her that are easy to understand. This is a great tool that she feels has helped on her path.
3,You probably don't need this beast.,"I caution you to think long and hard before you drop [$$$] on a thing like this. I leapt before I looked and now I have gobs of information that I don't need. ... I was bewitched by the lamination and spiral binding, both wonderful ideas, but there are several other atlases out there that offer the same features for 1/2 the price. And they're aimed at car drivers. This thing really is for professional over-the-road truckers, of course, as the name implies, and I'm sure it's marvelous for that purpose. And don't get me wrong, it's still a great atlas. ... So think about it before you buy it, unless for some reason you REALLY need to know the height of all the bridges you'll be driving under."
5,Works great !,Hard to obtain locally and was again saved by Amazon. Great product and arrived quickly.
2,Rehash of a second rate sci-fi horror movie,"Walter Mosley's ""Easy Rawlins"" series is well plotted, the characters are well thought out, and the stories are very original. I am a fan of his new ""Fearless Jones"" series, which does a lot to explain racism in 1950s Los Angeles.Nothing I've read about Walter Mosley explains why he would want to write this piece of trite. This book is the worst rehash of bad 1950s sci-fi movies that I've read in years. I've been reading sci-fi for forty years and this is about as bad as it gets. The story is totally trash, you know the ending before you get past the beginning, the characters are ridiculous, and the sex scenes are even worse (hard to ruin sex, but he does it).If this was by anyone else it never would have gotten published. It would be a favor to him and all his fans to buy back every copy that exists and bury them."
4,"Worth the Time, if you are so inclined.","Walter Mosley is, of course, the author of the `Easy Rawlins' series (of which I'm a huge fan) and the `Fearless Jones' series (not so much). He has also from time to time taken a detour outside of mystery/crime fiction to write very speculative stuff in SciFi and other things; for example see `The Man in My Basement' for a really startling view of race relations.This little volume has some really fine writing, but some problems with the plot. I had a hard time really believing some of the characters who seemed, to me, to be pretty one dimensional. But be that as it may, it is worth a read. The ideas herein are interesting, if a bit too `supernatural' for my taste."
4,"Two interesting early Russian films,","The Girl With the Hatbox"" is the real prize in these two films. A cute, charmingsilent comedy of Russian girl who travels between her home in the country andan apartment owned by a greedy, rich couple in Moscow.She meets a poor student with nowhere to go, and ends up marrying him to givehim the right to stay in the apartment although the marriage starts as just a platonicarrangement. Lots of hi-jinx ensue, almost all well acted, and I found myself enjoyingit way more than I expected to. Yes, there are some over the top performances, anda couple of unneeded sub-plots, including our heroines cruel ignoring of the post manwho is in love with her, but overall this is a breezy, sweet comedy, well worth watching.""Outskirts"" is an interesting, if not totally successful and sometimes awkward mix ofcomedy and drama, expressionism and realism in a study of small town life and thehorrors of WW I. Some wonderful photography, but distractingly bad post-dubbed sound."
4,Good textbook,"This book was extremely difficult to read, but the information in it is great and useful to anyone who wants to know about the entirety of OT thought."
4,"Great for Darger Fans, But Buyer Beware","The the Henry Darger fan this is a welcome addition to the growing number of books on Darger. It is easily the biggest book in number of pages. The essay is very informative and there are great reproductions not found in other books. This and the Henry Darger: Art and Selected Writings are my 2 favorite Darger books. But beware book collectors, because the book has so many pages (500 plus), the pages start to come loose from the binding. For some reason, the binding just can't hold the pages securely. Maybe that's why the book is a bargain for the number of pages. So you may want to get an extra copy if you're a book collector."
5,"wonderful woman, extraordinary book",beautifully design and illustrated work by a woman who has devoted her life to chimpanzee rescue and understanding...(...)--this is for all children
2,overpriced AND smells bad,"claims to be natural/organic although product ends up smelling like plastic. Used it once and never again. For extreme dry lips, try pure shea butter instead."
3,Good product,"Not as emollient as I hoped it would be, but still a good product. Don't know if I would buy again ."
3,travel Jumble,I haven't received yea don't know. I'm buying from you because the woman I care for is 97 yrs old and loves doing these. I want to get new ones all the time.
3,Crazy Jumbles,"The puzzles are good,but the format is too large.I prefer a smaller size book.One that is easier to carry with you, as on planes etc."
5,Great cello playing,"These are the very best recordings ever made by Zara Nelsova. This is great cello playing: total control and musicianship. Some of this stuff hasn't been available for 30-40 years, like the Beethoven sonatas, the Dvorak with Krips, the Lalo, and others. It also has some amazing pieces by Bloch, including her best recording of Schelomo, Voice in the Wilderness, and Jewish Life with the composer at the piano. The sound is good, mono, but still high quality. One drawback is that you can often Nelsova's fingers hitting the fingerboard. The intensity and personality really comes through though, and I can't recommend this collection of outstanding cello playing highly enough."
4,"Good toy, fast shipping",This was a fun toy for my nephew. It was in good condition and arrived promptly.
4,Nice album!,This is a very nice album by Diego el Cigala. It was a great addition to my collection. I recommend it to lovers of spanish modern music.
3,Diego back to the real Flamenco...,"If you loved ""Lagrimas Negras"" and could not wait for his next project...Well , you might be disapointed ! Diego sounds very different on this project , and not so great at my taste . I have a real problem with flamenco singers , and I must say that that I can listen to so much of it . Unfortunatly , On this CD I found his singing very anoying , I did not find the heart that he had on ""Lagrimas Negras"" , too many tracks are too similar .Sorry Diego we love you , but not on this project ."
3,"Okay, but a little loud and larger than I expected.","The product works fine, but it's definitely louder than I thought it would be. I've never had a purifier before, so I'm not sure what the norm is, but I have a hard time sleeping with it on in my bedroom (even with the nighttime setting on). It's also a little larger than I thought, and because it has to be a certain distance away from furniture, walls, etc., it takes up even more room."
2,It really is loud,"I read some of the reviews warning how loud this filter is. Being an allergy sufferer, i have had many air filters in my life.THis thing is huge. It is hard to talk to others in the same room if the purifier is not on the low ""sleep"" setting."
2,"Nice and loud, but some erratic noises","I purchased this product primarily for its white noise generating ability, and secondarily for a dust allergy that I have. For sound masking, it is good in the sense that it is extremely loud -- not unlike a motel AC unit on high. However, in the two units I have tried, you can hear an intermittent scraping sound (as if something is rubbing ever so slightly in the fan), which can become irritating. I realize that this is a subtle point, but for people who are extremely sensitive to sound abnormalities and are considering this unit for its white noise generating qualities, you should be aware of this potential issue. I rarely use the unit as a result."
1,Bad quality - poor value,"I bought one of these, took it home, turned it on, and it had a bad rattle and would shake when running. I turned it off and looked it over carefully. You can see the fan through the slot on top. The fan had a section of plastic missing throwing it off balance. I am surprised the assemblers of the unit tried to slip an obvious defective part into a unit. Neverless, I took it back and swapped it for another unit. Although the new unit did not rattle, it shook when operating on low speed and made a pulsating wind noise. Looking at the fan on this unit found it to be off center slightly. I took the second one back, got a refund, and bought a different brand model at sears."
3,not sure,"I'm not too sure what to say...is it bad? no...is it great? no. I bought this to help purify the air in my office here in Afghanistan. Let's just say to start that is no easy task!! The unit seems to be functioning well enough but it's a little on the loud side and it really drops the temperature in a room. It has not had any issues and seems to be working...as I said, the air here is terrible to begin with so it's hard to say if it's really making a dent. I'd like to think it is."
1,Extremly Loud,"It took all but a minute to figure out that this unit is just too loud on the lowest setting. This unit might work great in a room that you do not use, but what's the point in that? You could also just turn the unit on when you are not in the room or when you leave the house altogether, but that's a pain and a purifier is best left on all the time. I eventually got the Blue air 201 series and at the highest setting it is quieter than this unit on the lowest! I really can't figure out why anyone could stand keeping this unit."
4,"Strong, Low Maintenance Costs, Loud","We have a couple dogs, one who sheds 365 days a year, and a bunch of rescued cats.These things do a pretty good job, it's amazing how much dust and fur is on the pre-filter when I change it. This thing really pumps the air. The pre-filters are relatively inexpensive.The trade-off is noise, even on Low. It actually provides nice white noise for sleeping, and is good for times when you are not home, but when you are home and awake, trying to have a conversation, or watch TV, this filter is too loud. Would be nice if it had an ""Ultra Low"" setting."
4,Early Impressions - Effective Against Cigarette Smoke,"Scenario: using unit in a 1,000 sq ft apt with 2 bedrooms, 1.5 baths; living in 2-unit apartment building on top floor; neighbors on bottom floor (2 adults) are heavy smokers; unit was purchased mainly to combat smokeHigh points- both smell and effects (eye and throat irritation) of smoke are undetectable- although the recommendation is for use in one large room, the unit seems to be filtering smoke from entire apartment- filters come with this unit- unit is easy to set-up- the cost is reasonable for this level of performanceLow points- you must adjust to the white noise - You can't love rain only when it's dry!- you must adjust to the fact that the unit will probably not match your furniture/decorI like this product because it fixed the problem of cigarette smoke from my downstairs neighbors in my apartment. It has exceeded my expectations. The high points far outweigh the low points for this scenario. I will update my review in six months."
3,Honeywell 50250-S Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier,"It seems to work okay, but it is very noisy and have to turn it off every time we watch tv."
2,Too noisy for my taste,"I guess this filter is a borderline case. It does it's job and is not excessively noisy so many people may be fine with it. However, for me it became clear after a few days that I could not imagine sleeping for a long period if time with the filter's hum in the background, so I figured that I was likely to eventually discontinue using it and put it in the attic. I ended up sending it back."
2,Stinky and Cold!,"It still smells weird after 2 weeks.And all the cold air blowing out is freezing me!I'm sending it back to amazon now.I am much happier with the counter top units Honeywell has. Ihave 3 strategically placed in my home to take the place of thebigger unit. And their filters do not need to be replaced at all, only vacuumed periodically. This one has a pre-filter that needs to replaced every 3 months, so more expense. It is really a rip-off to say that it has a permanent filter & then call the replacement a pre-filter.There is too much to say negatively about this; read the fine print in the ad for the stuff that doesn't make sense."
2,Way too loud!,"This filter does a pretty good job cleaning air, but we almost never can benefit from that because the noise level is all but unbearable. At the lowest setting, it sounds like other HEPA filters at the medium or high setting. And at the highest setting this pretty much makes conversation impossible in that room. It's like this thing doesn't have a low setting.After this, we got the Holmes HAP756-U True HEPA Allergen Remover for Very Large Rooms. MUCH quieter and still pushes about the same amount of air."
4,Effective but Loud,"I purchased this filter for my office at work, and it does great. The difference in the air quality was very fast, and has really made my office more enjoyable to work in. The biggest negative to this filter is its noise level, its way to loud to be used in a sleeping area. If noise is not a real concern however, it will get the job done. I have a 20 x 25 office, and have it in the far corner so the noise wont interfere with my phone calls."
4,"Noisey, but cleans the air.","I really like air cleaners but this model is very noisey. If I use it in the living room it makes it hard to hear the TV. It does a great job keeping down the dust in the air. Nothing beats a Hepa filter, but i wish it was quieter."
4,Works well,"This air purifier has worked well for us. We live in the country and use wood heat in the winter. This air filtration system has really cut down on the dust. It's a little noisy, especially on high fan, but it works well."
2,Not Permanent HEPA filter,"I ordered this product because it indicated it has a permanent HEPA filter.. the ""N"" In the model number is supposed to indicate that.However, the one I received did NOT have a permanent filter but did have a replaceable (2x year) HEPA filter which would run about $100 yearto maintain. Not we I expected. Also the photos and descriptions don't align...Some photos are of the ""N"" model while others are not.Returned this to Amazon."
4,Quality item,My wife is not waking up congested or sneezing and is sleeping better since we installed this in our bedroom. We're both glad we got it.
4,Honeywell 50250N,"This product is excellent in clearing the air; however, it is a bit noisy.We bought three of them, and they are just great. If you put them in the living room, dining room, den; no problem with the noise. It is in the bedroom that there is a slight roar. It is a great unit."
1,Avoid!!! Can't replace HEPA Filter with single filter!,"I've owned a lot of Honeywell HEPA filters over the years, but have never before encountered the bait-and-switch on the filter replacement. They somehow manage to sell you the unit WITH a single large filter, but be advised you cannot order a SINGLE large Honeywell replacement filter - you have to order 3 smaller filters & stack them together. The stacking of 3 smaller filters will of course change the dynamics and filtering capacity of the unit. The HEPA filters do need to be replaced sooner or later. I bought two of these & am sorry I did!!!"
1,permanent air filter,I called KAZ the manufacturer's Service Department. I was told they did not manufacture a PERMANENT FILTER for the model50250. So if they do I got the OLD MODEL even though I was ASSURED by MYINNOVATIONS.COM the Merchant that I was gettingthe Permanent Filter. Advertising one thing and getting another is not good.Theodore Denney
2,Replacement pre-filters are wasteful,"When you go to replace the pre-filter in this unit,(Honeywell HRF-APP1), You will have to cut to fit, which is not a big deal, but you will have over 1/3 of the material left over; not enough for another filter. You will have spent $15+ and end up throwing away $5. What a waste. If you replace the pre-filter three times a year, that really adds up. They really need to address this issue."
3,Extremely noisy,"Goods:- Appear to filter the air well- The power button light is very bright; we can even use it as a night light.Bads:- Extremely noisy, even when running at low speed.- Blows out plastic smell very extensively during the first few weeks of use.- There's no timer to turn it off.- Obstructive: according to its user guide, the unit needs to be in the center of the room for it to work efficiently."
3,Honeywell aircleaner,It appears to be keeping the air clean but it is quite noisy. Overall I believe it is worth the investment.
3,Decent,"It's rather too loud for my RV (35 foot), so I use it in my home now. It definitely cleans the air. I keep it in my shop area and run it when I'm cutting a lot of lumber on the table saw. It cleans air in minutes. The double filter really helps keep HEPA filter lasting longer. And the washable outside filter also keeps cost down. I like it, but don't love it. I still haven't found anything better, though. If you want this thing in a really quiet room, forget it. If you want it in a baby's room to make white noise, ti will be perfect. I also had smell with it sometimes, but then when I washed the outside filter, it helped. But the filter wasn't that dirty. Don't think that's a problem with the operation of the unit itself, but maybe a filter or even a basement issue. I'm not sure."
2,Makes to much noise.,"There doesn't seem to be any way to get this Air Purifier to stop making noise.I've tried adjusting the speed and the knob on the bottom of the assembly. Stillmakes a loud, like a bearing is rough, vibration noise."
3,Its loud,"I also do not mind white noise, like an oscillating fan, but the lowest setting on this filter is like an extra high setting on an oscillator. Just a little too much to sleep with"
4,Works fine,Works fine. A little noisy when on high but just run it on high when we are out of the house. Have only had for 1 month but my friend has had hers for over 2 years and going strong. That is why I bought this brand and style.
5,Just as advertised,"It took less than 5 minutes to set up the 2 purifiers I ordered. I turned them on and it is now a week later with no problems. Don't you love how they want you to review a product when you first get it before you even know whether it is going to work out? If something goes wrong I will do another written review. Be careful to purchase the correct filters to keep the performance you bought this for. A cheaper prefilter is out there that will not remove odors, etc."
1,Way too noise for home use,way way way too much noise for home use. They might have designed this for office.Please think twice before you buy it for home
2,good filter but VERY loud,"We have shipped this item back due to the noise volume it produces. In ""turbo"" mode you can hear it in every room of the house with the bedroom door closed!! When the fan is set on low the filter is louder then a standard box fan on high, this is too noisy for the application we bought it for."
4,Almost perfect,"Ohhhh the wonderfulness of clean fresh air. Does exactly as advertised and exceedingly well. Only annoyance is bright blue light emitting from control knob. Simple fix by just throwing a shirt over it at night (or removing the light entirely but few have time for such mechanical intricacies.) A bit loud at the lowest setting as well, but ends up humming me right to sleep. Has helped significantly with odors and allergies. Highly recommended."
5,"Gets out the mold smell. Loud, but does what it is indeed to do.","Gets out the mold smell. Loud, but does what it is indeed to do.I would buy it again.I may buy for one of my children.Amazon shipping was quick.A couple of months later - still love this hepa filter and would buy it again; I leave it running 24x7 with no problems yet."
5,Excellent for reducing smoke odors,"When my boyfriend moved into a new apartment, he found out too late that the people below him smoke heavily and continuously. My eyes would water and burn and the smell was awful - it stuck to my clothes, hair and stuff. I desperately read tons of reviews on air purifiers and ultimately chose this one. It has made a huge difference! It has reduced the smoke odors dramatically. Other people have complained that it is noisy - and it is. But we turn it down to the lowest setting when we are watching t.v. or listening to music. Otherwise we leave it on high and it is no worse than all the other noise that comes with living in the city. In fact, it acts as white noise to drown out a lot of the street noise. His apartment is probably about 600 sq ft. This air purifier worked great for most of it, but we did end up needing a smaller extra one for the bedroom so we could run it with the door closed at night."
3,noisy,"replacing a dead hamilton beach purifier w/ auto fan speed and a ""whisper"" mode, i found this unit very noisy even on the lowest setting. if you actually put it in a room that matches it's square footage rating, you will be cranking the volume on your voice or anything else you need to hear in the room.i purchased this because the HEPA filter can be cleaned and doesn't require purchasing another, at least for some time. i haven't actually cleaned the filter yet, so i can't comment on that."
1,Bad Product,Do not buy this product!! I had to send back a second unit in less that a year. The units only blow out air but no intake of air. After running for weeks the black filter was as clean as the day I installed it. The company says they never have any problems like I have had but I had to pay $35.00 to send each unit back. RIPOFF!!!
2,Not great,While a good value. Nowhere until you open the box does it tell you that it is going to off gas for a couple days. A purifier shouldn't off gas that strong it is meant to clean the air. Also I found the fan on the lowest setting to be louder than other purifiers and you could almost here it rotate.
2,not what I expected,"I had an Ionic breeze which I was very happy with. I kept it on the fireplace mantle and it worked great with the ""not in use fireplace smells"". I had it for years till it died. I thought I would try this as it was very highly rated. Everyone said it was noisy and it is. I found that all it does is blow the odors around. The thing has to sit in the middle of the room as it is huge. I wasn't happy going to filters but I thought I would try it, because it is rated so high. I am sorry I did. It doesn't clean the air, it pushes the odors around, it is noisy and it is cumbersome. Not at all what I wanted but I was duped by the reviews."
4,Helped end allergic headachesw,"We just moved into a newly remodeled house. My remodeling included some sheet-rock repairs and the resulting dust. I am allergic to dust. Consequently, I have been suffering from it. Some headaches were so bad that I became nauseated and had to go to bed. The pain never completely went away. That is, not until I purchased the Homeywell 50250. It was an easy out-of-box install that only took a few minutes. We ran it on full power for a few days. By day two, my headaches disappeared. This product delivered on its promises and promotional literature. My wife and I couldn't be happier. If you have allergies, or if you don't, breath better, remove smells, and clear the air with this fantastic tool. You can't go wrong. - John"
4,good,the air purifier works well. the only problem is that it takes up a lot of space. it provides great white noise for sleeping.
2,Good Product - Bad Replacement Filters,"Purchased this unit 3-4 years ago. Has been running every night since then and have had no problems but...Three years ago I would have recommended this product, but the new replacement filter system is just bad. It requires 3 filters (HRF-F1)and a foam gasket thus not sealing as well as the origional 24000 replacement."
2,Wet dog,"It seemed to be working well for a few months. Then, just after the return policy expired, started smelling like a wet dog. Look at the reviews carefully online before purchasing--*many* are having this problem. This is obviously a cheaply made unit and you are rolling the dice if the one you purchase will last longer than a few months."
3,"Large, Loud, But Noticable Improvement","This sounds just like a fan, which doesn't bother me because I prefer to have a fan running while I sleep, however the lowest setting it the loudest I would want it to be. We bought this because we have a smoker in the house and no one is a fan of it. If you put this on too high with the smoke, it just circulates the smoke around the room because of the amount of air it pushes out which is a major bummer. I also hate the fact that you have to buy ""pre-filters"" so it really doesn't have a permanent filter system. However, with these cons, if you leave the unit on before there are smells in the house, it does a pretty good job filtering them out."
4,works well,I purchased this item to purify the air in our bedroom.It is loud when on high [air rushing noise] but that is one of the reasons we bought it too. Drowned out the other sounds.Had it running 24/7 for the past 4 weeks with no problems
5,Love it! Clean air!,Got ths super fast and it works great! We have a new baby and have dogs so this air purifier has helped tremendously with keeping the air clean.
5,HONEYWELL 50250-S HEPA Round Air PURIFER,It does the job I bought it to do--love it--would recommend it to anyone interested in an air-purifer for a large room
2,so so air purifier,"I bought two different brand air purifiers and this one is by far inferior. As other reviews indicate, it is very noisy. I have it on upstairs in a bedroom and can hear it downstairs. Also it must be placed 3 feet from anything which pretty much means it is very visible and in the way. These I could live with if it did a better job of purifying the air. There is not much change in the dust and pet fur accumulating on the furniture. I also purchased a Winix WAC9500. More expensive but worth the money. The air is clear with significant reduction in dust and pet fur on the furniture. It can also be placed behind furniture, no 3 foot restriction. The Winix gets a thumbs up."
4,Best value among true HEPA air purifiers.,"Of all the ""true HEPA"" air purifiers in the 200 to 250 CADR range, Honeywell 50250 is the least expensive. CADR is the Clean Air Delivery Rate. The higher the CADR number, the greater the volume of air gets filtered per minute.Prices at Amazon.com250 CADR__Honeywell 50250_______ $129.99_5-year warranty315 CADR__Whirlpool AP45030K____ $249.99_1-year211 CADR__GE AFHC21AM_________ $214.99_1-year240 CADR__Blueair 403____________ $549.00_5-yearI bought this from seller Amazon in December 2012. I would have given this 50250 a 5-star rating if the noise is not so loud.I have a Duracraft HEPA air purifier which is still operating without any problems after 8 years. I notice the Honeywell and the discontinued Duracraft air purifiers use the same design.Make sure you plug air purifiers into a surge protector to make them last longer."
3,Great potential - but fails,"I had my previous Honeywell air cleaner for over 5 years. I liked it so much that I bought 3 more for gifts for other family members with dust allergies. But when I needed a replacement that unit was no longer available - I bought this one. It is slightly less efficient at removing dust and dog hair, and WAY noisier. My old one could be running 24/7 in a bedroom and no real problem with the noise. This one absolutely must be turned off when sleepy-time comes. It can run and clean the air when you are not present, but it must be turned off in order to sleep or even have a conversation. I am satisfied with its performance for the price - but very dis-satisfied with the noise levels resulting only an average rating. If you have another choice, even at a few dollars more, consider taking it."
4,Very happy with the results!,"We purchased this air purifier because my daughter's asthma acts up everytime she gets a cold (which happens too frequently with the midwest weather conditions). We've had the purifier for about 6 weeks & we have seen a dramatic difference in her condition (plus it benefits my husband & I too). Because the purifier can be a little bit loud on the high setting, we only run the high setting when we're not home. When we're home, we use the medium setting & at night, the low setting. It's so easy to move the unit from room to room that we now run it 24/7 in our home. For the cost, I would definitely recommend this to anyone considering an air purifier!"
4,Works well..except for the blue light,"This model is every bit as good as all the reviews state: It filters very well, It is loud (but I like the white noise). I returned mine to the store because unlike a previous model that I owned this one has an intense blue light on the control knob that is too bright for my taste. Other than the light..I would have kept it. For those that do not mind this then I would recommend the model. I will look for the same brand but one that does not have this light on it."
5,allergy chaser.,"I highly recommend this air cleaner, especially for someone with pets and/or allergy problems. We live in the country surrounded by pollen, have indoor pets, and this is the only unit that cuts the allergens. A perk is less dust. I have 2 of these units, which run full time, and this purifier does a superb job. Amazon has a great price and great delivery time. In this era of high gas prices having it delivered to the door is the way to go."
3,Smells like wet dog.,"I've owned this air filter for five months now and used it about a dozen times. We really loved it and it cleaned the air and got rid of the allergies. But this last time we turned it on, it started to emit a foul smell and made my room smell like wet dog. We cleaned all the filters and still doesn't help. It seems to be coming from the motor. I did some research online & found out many other people have this problem and nobody has found a solution except to just stop using the filter which is what I'm gonna do. What a waste of money. I wanted my air to smell fresher not like dog. I don't even own a dog."
5,Great HEPA filter!,"My husband and I received this Honeywell Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier as a wedding gift about 2 years ago. We've been using this filter nonstop since.Because my husband's work shop is attached to our home, a lot of dust particles and pollen make their way into our house many times a day, either on clothing or just in the air. There are three settings on this Filter and a light that will indicate when it needs to be cleaned. Since we use it constantly, I can say it withstands a lot of dust before needing to be cleaned. Not that I am recommending you wait like we sometimes do. Cleaning the filter is super easy. We just use an attachmenet from our vacuum and it's done in minutes.This is a side feature, or rather bonus for me, but it also acts as a bit of a fan. It seems to help keep things cool during the Spring and Summer months.My only regret is that we just have one. I really could use another."
4,Like sitting in the front row of a Spinal Tap Concert,"We have had a Honeywell HEPA filter for over 10 years now and we decided to buy another one and put the old one in the garage. The new one pushes a lot of air...but then again, so does Grandpa.Oh, sure it cleans the air great in the high setting, but it will chase you out of the room like a visit from your mother-in-law, because its so loud. The low setting is tolerable but the humm does get to you after a while. You notice the quiet when you finally shut it off.We turn the new Honeywell on high at night, medium or low during the day, and low to off in the evenings."
2,this is the wrong unit for the bedroom,"Yes, this is the wrong unit for the bedroom. Even at the lowest setting unit is too loud to sleep though. The unit also has a lighted dial which would work as a great nite light if you needed one. I do believe I could tell a difference in the air quality but as ours was purchased for the bedroom it will need to go back."
1,Wont startup,I bought this product it wont startup. I used to right converter to convert from 220v to 110v and now it cost more than the product cost to ship it back. Now struck with a non starter.
3,There are likely better purifiers out there,"I chose this model from the thousands of choices based on Amazon reviews and my own price range. I live in an apt furnished by my job, and we noticed mold on the ceiling of our bedroom. Add to that a Doberman and a Persian cat, and we were constantly suffering from runny noses and sneezing. Initially, we were excited to receive this, and felt that it did improve the air quality. After having it for several months now, it doesn't seem to be doing as good of a job. We decided just to leave it off one night and realized that we were breathing better the next morning than we had been breathing with it running all night long. I'm not sure why that is. Maybe it needs a new filter?Either way, I deducted 2 stars because of the size, the noise, and the fact that it has to be 3 feet away from everything."
4,OK,"It's a solid product. Just wish it was a little smaller, or taller -- some sort of space-saving design. Otherwise, its a good HEPA purifier."
3,A little loud,"Quick delivery, seems to work just fine, but it is a bit louder than I had hoped. I have a honeywell at work that is quieter on high than this one is on low."
3,Good unit to large for a normal bedroom,Unit works very well but is to much air for a small bedroom. Need to use a smaller unit for a small room
1,Waste of space,I purchased this over a year ago. It was used for four months. If you want something that makes noise and does NOTHING else buy this. First bad product I have ever purchased on Amazon.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this product in the hopes that it would help to remove a mildew smell in my apartment. I ended up returning it because of three factors: it didn't help with the smell, it was surprisingly large and an eye sore, and it was loud (about as loud as a dryer). I had read all of the reviews that had discussed the noise that it made, but I only really understood when it arrived and I turned it on. The noise might be acceptable if you were going to turn it on in an underground basement and shut the door behind you..."
2,We were disappointed.,"This unit didn't clean the dust from the air. It might have been cleaning the tiny unseen dust mites, but the room seem to gather dust even faster when the unit was on. Also it is noisy. My daughter said she still woke up stuffy, so she would rather suffer from her dust mite allergy than try to sleep with the unit on. We couldn't keep a unit that took up so much space and didn't do what we needed it to do."
2,not really impressed (specifically for dust),"i didn't even get this for the air purity or allergens, or whatever. i just wanted some help in minimizing the dust in my apt. i dust about once-a-week and so i know how much dust generally accumulates during a week's time. my expectations for this air purifier were a range from hoping that it would virtually eliminate the need for dusting to at least help me cut down on the frequency.i honestly can't say i see any impact. and i even run it on turbo like almost 24-7.in all fairness, i don't think it's because this particular one is not good, but rather, i'm thinking now that there really isn't an air purifier that is going to be worthwhile. i chose this one after about two months of researching.it does seem to act as a decent fan though, circulating the air in my 4th floor apt."
1,Terrible Smelling Output,"I would have rated this purifier with a negative number of stars if that were an option. The rubber seals on the top and bottom of the cylindrical HEPA filter emit a foul odor, which the fan distributes throughout the room. The product, as an air cleaner, is therefore less than worthless."
3,"Loud noise, even on low",The low level produces a loud noise making it difficult to sleep as well as the light on the knobs. It did not produce the air purifying effect I was hoping for.
2,Too noisy,"If you need a purifier to keep running at all times, this is not for you. This is way to noisy."
4,Works very well,"My dog and I both have asthma, and my (very small) cabin is decorated in ""early library"", so it's impossible to get rid of the dust. This product cleans the air very, very well. We haven't had an attack since I got it (that's just our personal experience though, it may not work the same for others). I can't fault the quality of this product.However, it's ugly as sin and somewhat inconvenient for a relatively small space, since you have to keep it away from the wall according to instructions. I couldn't do that, since it would then end up sort of in the middle of my living space. LOLIt might be loud for some people, but it certainly doesn't bother me on a lower setting."
4,"Yes, it works, noise and first ""new"" odor as expected","I ordered this item, got here on time. I knew it was going to be a noisy one to start. The new smell, this, it took about 3 days of full usage to get rid of. However, I can tell the air is cleaner and my sinus is less stuffy. The airflow of this thing is very noticeable. Does it cycle the entire bedroom within an hour? May be..., I would not be surprised.I give you guys one more interesting function for those with small children (or kids at heart):This can function as a wind generator for levitating balloons. My son successfully put 3 balloons circling around&above; the unit for 10-20 seconds at a time. This occupied my son for 30 min. Awesome. It occupied me for 10 min. That is a bonus. Make sure to put the unit against the corner of the room.Enjoy!"
4,"Move HUGE amount of air per $, not permanent HEPA","Best bang for the buck air purifiers, It moves a bunch of air per dollar. Is it the quietest at Max 61.6dba? No, but Medium 55.9 dba and low 48.6 dba still move more air than these smaller slim units though. I run mine on max in an unoccupied room and leave the door open for circulation. The lower settings seem to be fine for room conversations and television. As of November 2012, this item ships without a permanent HEPA. I was always skeptical of the effectiveness of a permanent filter and am willing to pay for a brand new filter every few months anyway. I have 2 of these units now. I gave 4 stars, but it is a 5 star value. I would only give 5 to a unit that moves as much air but is quieter. You probably need one of those high end units for $800 to accomplish that."
3,50300 similar - energy hog,"This applies to the 50300 model. The 50250 is almost identical.Power consumption kind of high: 50 watts on low, 170 medium and 200+ on high. Honeywell does not put this info on the box - I had to call them. Even on low it's not too quiet but acceptable. List price for the 50250 which replaces the discontinued 50300 is $249.99. I got my 50300 at Costco (Jan '09) for $160. The true HEPA reusable filter is what sold me. But I guess I'll be paying in electricity: About $50 per year on low (at 11 cents per kilowatt hour) and $200 a year on high."
5,works great but loud,I just want to say if you want clean air. Get one of these. Very loud on the high setting but after a day or two it becomes white noise and you would not even notice. I am about to buy another one for the bedroom.
3,Yes its loud.,"Yes this unit is loud, even on its lowest setting. We keep it on low during times of conversation and watching television. During the night it's on high. It seems to make a difference. I noticed that dust floating in the air is reduced significantly. I've also noticed a decrease in the severity of my allergies. Time will tell. I live in Austin, Tx. I'd recommend it if you can put up with the noise."
5,air cleaner,I love this air purifier. It has different settings from low to high and works great! It was delivered fast and seems worth the price.
1,Chemical smell/Problem with filter,I bought this air purifier for a small back cottage area. It worked really well but after 1 day of use I had an enormous headache and dizzy spell after walking into the room. I unplugged it and waited a day and tried the machine again in the main house where I had the same reaction. I did notice that the filter for the purifier smelled really strong when I first installed it so I'm guessing it's the filter. I have never had this kind of response to an item and have not suffered from chemical allergies in the past.
4,Honeywell 50250 air purifier,"My problem is that I ordered a new item and received a used item. I sent it back, reordered and received same used item. How do I get a new item when that is what I order and pay for?Leona Green"
4,It sounds like a fan!,"I bought this fan to use in my living room with the wood stove. I was hoping that I would see a decrease in the amount of dust in the room. I didn't really see a decrease in the dust but the air seemed better. It sounds like a fan, therefore we don't run it when we are in the living room watching tv or on the phone. We usually let it run all night and all day while we are at work. We have only had the fan for about a month so I have not had any of the other complaints, like unbalanced blades or that it stopped working."
2,"Large, Bright and Loud","I live in a small one bedroom apartment and I wanted to buy an air cleaner for the bedroom. I should have done my due diligence as this purifier is much larger than I thought. This is definitely not a table top unit. The unit is very loud. One of those that cycles from high to low, so brace yourself when you first switch it on. Even on low settings, it's louder than my AC. The light on the power switch is very very bright. It emits a blue light that illuminates the entire area where I put it. I had to tape a piece of cardboard over it because it to block the light. Even then the light is still very noticeable."
2,Don't waste your time,"i dont know why i bothered... i knew this was going to happen. i had to return this filter because... it SUCKED.it was sooo loud but didn't make much of a difference in amount of dust or the air.i do think that it does somewhat work because i left it on medium and went away for a week. when i came home, my apt wasn't as dusty as it would've been, but it still didn't justify me keeping it. heavy to lug around. and is an eyesore."
1,Used Item broken sold as new,"This item was received with a taped box and directions to install pre-filter when opening the bottom the electric controll panel fell out. That was not the worst yet, no prefilter or filter present. I called to return and have to wait 5 days for another try at replacement unit. If second try gets a used item I will seek refund. I can't rate item until I get one that is in working order. I see others received used items as well sold as new be careful. I am hoping for a new factory sealed item in the second try and will post evaluation of product then so my rating is related to amazon not the product."
2,Honeywell is the best,This is the best you can get.This is the best you can get.If you are not moving air you are not cleaning air.TI
4,I was going to buy this Air Purifier..,"from Amazon. But then they went and kicked the WikiLeaks site off of their overflow servers, caving into to illegal threats from Joe Lieberman. So I vote with my dollar, and am buying the very same product from NewEgg.Actions have consequences."
3,Need for Allegies,Rather noisey but gets the job done. Once you get used to the noise at higher speeds not really a distraction unless you are watching TV in the same room
2,Don't Buy,"I bought this product because of the lifetime HEPA filter and thought the Honeywell name represented quality. However, the machine was noisy at all speeds and the motor siezed up after about one year of use. The warranty had expired and the cost to repair was not worth it."
2,Noisy albeit somewhat effective,This particular design is noisy and not particularly effective. The drum with the carbon filter placed around it is a pain to get on neatly or correctly. I finally got rid of this thing and got a Kenmore and Hunter both of which are quieter.
2,Smelly and loud,"This air purifier is really loud, even on the lowest setting and the air that is pushed out is like having a box fan on. Not so good on colder days. The worst thing is that this gives off a wet dog smell. When I change out the filter, it is fine for a couple days, then the wet dog smell returns. It is strong! Blue light is annoying. Upset I spent so much money on something i cannot use comfortably."
5,Works great,"This purifier is what I was looking for. Before buying this I was skeptical about the performance but finally I just gave it a try. We do cook everyday and most of our cooking (Indian cooking) involves a lot of spicey preparations. Be it garlic, fish or whatever. I just need to run it for an hour and a half and smell is gone.Hope this review helps."
4,air cleaner,"Great product. Rather loud on highest setting but gets the job done. Set it on high while you're gone and let it do its magic, then turn it down when you return. No problems."
4,Great air filter/background noise machine,"I had experience with this model before, and although at first it appeared noisy, the white noise grew on me. It blocked out the outside noise of NYC streets. Over the course of 3 years I used the last one (It was on loan), it worked without any problems. The main complaint is the bright light. It is hellish and was a major pain in my sleepy eyes.Now in a new apartment closer to the street, I wanted a machine to do three things: 1. Circulate the air in my room. 2. Filter the air. 3. Create ample background noise to block of the traffic and train noise. I was able to purchase one machine that does all three. So far I'm very happy. As to the light? I've taped a piece of foil over the control panel that I flip back to turn on the purifier and flip back to cover the light. It works well enough and doesn't flap in the wind."
4,good one for a small space,"I brought it to help clean up the air in the basement where my kids play all the times in summer. It works fine as you can feel the difference from a distance vs near the purifier. Since I have a fairly large basement (800sqft), I feel at least I need put 2 down there... In terms of noise from the fan, it's quite loud when the fan runs at full speed. But definitely not as bad as a HEPA vacuum. When people play or watch movies, you won't feel it much, especially at low speed."
3,"Works well, but loud.","This seems to work well as an air filter.It is pretty loud. I have to leave it on low when in the room.I like that it has a permanent filter, but I'd recommend vacuuming it outside with a non-hepa shop vac to clean the filter. Otherwise you'll just be transferring the particles to another filter or back into the air."
4,Easy to set up,"I just received our Honeywell 50250. It was very easy to set up. It is sort of noisy but no more so then our box fan. The only thing I notice that is negative is I smell something funny when it's running. Maybe it's just fresh air that I don't even recognize any longer. Who knows. I'm waiting for hubby to get home to see if he smells anything. Aside from that, it's big, it sucks in and put out with great energy.I know I haven't sneezed all day so that in and of itself is a blessing. With 6 dogs running around there is a LOT of dander floating around."
5,Best purchase yet from Amazon,My son has COPD and this hepa filter is making breathing so much easier for him. It also cuts down on my allergy attacks. I am glad we don't have to get rid of our furry pets to enjoy better air.
3,Probably works but sounds like a plane,"I bought this based on the reviews of it being the best filtration. Well, it might work but it's so loud, even on the low setting, that we could not keep the filter in the living room. Be prepared for a very large and loud unit if you purchase this."
1,"Very loud, unusable, poor filter design","Even on the low setting this filter is really loud from even another room. The medium and high settings are like having an airplane in your front room. I don't see how anyone can actually use this. I wish I could leave it on to see how well it filtered, but it's simply way too loud. The filter design is also very fragile, and due to this mine was crushed on shipping. This can be fixed with a new filter, but still a cheap design for the amount of money they want. I will probably not buy another Honeywell product after experiencing such a poorly designed piece."
3,"Beware, I received used items","I ordered 2 of these units from Amazon after paying twice as much for the same item at Home Depot. When they arrived they BOTH appeared to have been used. Neither of the units were in their protective plastic bags and one was missing the pre-filter. These were not labeled as refurbished but had obviously been returned. Amazon is sending replacements, but something is wrong with the system."
4,"good product, good price","We purchased the Honeywell 50250 several weeks ago after a fair amount of research. The filter works as promised. We both noticed great relief from allergies and sleep better too. It is a bit on the noisy side, we have it on low at night, and have gotten used to it. No problems at all."
4,"Its okay, has its pros and cons like everything else","Pros: Cleans the air well, can tell a difference in my home. Hepa filter never needs replacing and the pre filters are inexpensive and easy to clean.Cons: Expensive, A little on the noisy sideI would recommend this unit to others and have recommended it. Overall a good buy and not disappointed."
5,Great Purifier,"This purifier was even better than I expected. I hardly ever have to dust in my bedroom, where I used to have to dust every other day.It is a little loud, but not so much to disturb my sleeping."
3,"Strange and dysfunctional family, but good characters","Gowdy has quite an imagination. This is the most dysfunctional family I've read about (right up there with ""Fall on Your Knees""). There is homosexuality, promiscuity, lies, secrets, and the silent Joan, who is the youngest daughter, thought to be brain damaged but extremely intelligent, and aware of her families betrayals in her own way.I am still trying to decide if I liked this book. The characters were interesting and they did draw my interest. But the story is way out there...certainly not a mainstream read. Gowdy's style confused me a bit at first by changing timelines often, and once that settled down I could follow the plot much easier.An interesting and somewhat shocking read...not sure that I would recommend it to others."
4,Marvelous Work from a Wonderful Canadian Author,"Barbara Gowdy's Mister Sandman is a wonderful find. It is amazing to discover how much fun and quirky the book and the characters are and, yet, somehow the writing always reaches deeper just when the reader does not expect it. The book creates emotion out of chaos and pieces together a novel of the heart that a lesser writer would have made straight forward and senimental. The author has simply made it strange turning into unusual turning into delightful turning into moving and then coming back again. These are characters that are hard to forget, particulary the baby Joan, a truly unique creation. It is great to find a Canadian author of such talent."
5,Desert Island Pick,"This is an amazing book! It's well-crafted, funny, sad, sensitive, mystical- all of the elements of the story come together for an ending that is perfection! This is a novel EVERYONE should read because it will change the way you look at ""ordinary people"". I cannot rave about it enough!"
3,Nice top,"I like prAna. The material is stretchy and the shirt hasn't lost it's shape after many uses/washes. I never have to adjust it, no matter how hard the practice is. My only complaint is that it feels a little hot, and when it gets sweaty, it doesn't really wick the sweat away from your skin. All in all, I don't think that's much of a problem, and would purchase prAna again."
3,Not really as pictured,The color is lighter than it was when it arrived. I also didn't find the rouching at the bust line to be very flattering. It went back.
1,prAna racer back top,"I don't like this top at all. From the reviews, I was expecting a nicer fabric, with more support. I'm very disappointed."
3,"ivory, not white","This is very ivory colored, not white at all. It is soft and somewhat sheer, so I wouldn't use it for ashtanga or hot yoga in the ivory color. The Sabin cut makes the girls look a little weird, they short of lean to the sides. Still, very comfy."
2,nothing like I expected,I EXPECTED this to be for the gym to sweat in. It is more like a chemise. It is a cotton blend ( does not wick moisture away from you) the built in shelf has NO support at all ( I would NEVER do a 5K in it) I'm not gonna go through the hassle of returning it; I'm just going to keep it for summer as the pattern is nice and will match with anything.
3,A strange mix,"Miles Davis' trumpet combined with J L Hooker's mumbling and groaning Delta-Blues? Plus Taj Mahal... What a strange idea! Than again, Miles loved strange musical mixes...I guess in a contemporary film noir this might work very well (I don't recall seeing the movie) and, indeed, at times it even works well as independent music, but basically, it's much more of a pleasant background music for blues fans..."
5,THE HOT SPOT IS BLUES YOU CAN USE,"THIS SOUNDTRACK (THE HOT SPOT) IS ONE OF THE BEST BLUE'S AND JAZZ,SOUNDTRACK THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD.JOHN LEE HOOKER IS AWESOME WITH THE HUMMING,MILES DAVIS IS EXCELLENT ON HIS HORN.THIS IS A MUST BUY SOUNDTRACK.IF YOU LOVE DOWNHOME BLUES THEN CHECK OUT THIS SOUNDTRACK."
3,Boogie children all grown up,Heard a bit of this on a late night FM station and knew I had to have it.John Lee Hooker and Miles Davis jam with Taj Mahal and a host of other cats doing what they do.It says written by Jack Nieitche the late great Columbia A&R man/producer but I think he just assembled them and turned on the mics.Its long on atmosphere and short on new ideas just some uber cool noise from these pros.So many of these cats are gone with Dennis Hopper(director of the film) being the latest.Taj carries on of course but you will never hear the likes of the guys in one studio again.A minor classic .
4,Misleading Picture,"I thought this would come tied but it didnt. This was my first bow tie and I was looking for something of high quality, that looked nice and that was no fuss getting on. This seemed to fit the bill until I got it and realized I've have to learn to tie it myself. So far no luck with that. It looks great and the quality is beautiful ( I got it in green) but for my first bowtie I wanted a sort of ""starter kit"" before getting into the real thing. Product needs to be described better."
3,"Good for the beginners, terrible for experienced players","This book is of a good help specially for young players and beginners, giving pictures of positions and explainig rythms and dynamics, but it's very simple for a more experienced player. The musics on the CD are very basic, usually with a keyboard help giving the chords and rythm, but in a very slow pace."
5,superlative,Sutter elaborates on critical issues that are ignored or treated superficially by other authors especially exception safety. The practitioner who does understand the contents of this book is doomed to make serious mistakes and I am certainly going to design and code with a much more critical eye.
5,It worth 6 stars.,"You can't find similar discussion on exception-safety, namespace, casts, ... Even Scott (arthur of ""effective C++"" and ""more effective C++"") says he fell into traps discussed in the book.It is as good as ""Design Patterns"", if not better. And the arthor will write a following volume, and I am waiting for it.zlan@hotmail.com"
3,Code hackers only,"I think that this book gives an amount of details that nobody is able to handle. If you have a concrete problem with a resemblance with one of the chapters, ok, read this chapter. But don't look for something useful the 99% of times. I have been swallowed by the amounts of details. Go to C++ Gotchas if you are a beginer or non-literat programmer that don't want to read Stoustrup reference.For sure there're lots of funy details about C++. But if you like hacking C++, go to the source... This means Stoustrup ""C++ programming language"" and ""Design and evolution of C++"", then if you understand these books (not so easy) then go to exceptional and all of this.Recommendation: Buy in pdf format (also the ""More exceptional"" volume) with the two volumes of ""Effective C++"" and in case you have any convoluted and strange problem look at them using search."
5,"Exceptional, really!","It's one of the best c++ books I have ever read, Herb has used simple words and explained wonderfully, I would recommed this book to all c++ developers. Have fun.zlan@hotmail.com"
5,"An invaluable, indispensable reference and guide.","The John Muir Trail runs 210 miles through the spectacular Sierra Nevada mountain range and serves as a connection to numerous trout-fishing waters.

Steve Beck's Trout-Fishing The John Muir Trail is a complete guide to this magnificent wilderness route, , illustrated throughout with color photos, and includes detailed information on planning and preparing for a trip to the John Muir Trail, fishing along the trail, fishing tackle, hiking gear, hiking tips, the top twenty trout streams, fly recommendations, and a great deal more. Whether novice angler or experienced fly-fisher, Trout-Fishing The John Muir Trail will prove an invaluable, indispensable reference guide."
3,"by me, my self, and I. Erick",Hi I'm a reader of the book Frozen Fire and I think that the book is really good for kids my age and above.This book is very interesting and is based on the real way of living of the Eskimos. On this book Matt's friend Kayak teaches Matt survival skills.
3,Frozen Fire,This story is about two young men named Matthew and Kayak.Matthew and Kayak get lost when they're looking for Matthew's father because they think the Matilda went down and the search team can't look for them because there is a lot of fog.
4,Frozen Fire,Frozen Fire is based on a true story about two boys who became lost in the Arctic and had to survive by their wits. Matthew is a boy from Arizona and his friend Kayak is an Eskimo boy. They combine their unique skills to help each other survive the hardships of their ordeal. I recommend this excellent story about friends and survival in the Arctic. It was very exciting.
1,Zippers lining already broke,"When I first got this bag, I was so excited to use it. It has a good amount of padding on the inside and the bag itself feels durable.I purchased this on 8/13 and my zipper liners already broke. I can no longer use the zippers and they fell off track. I may have gotten a defective one but I would expect a bag at this price wouldn't fall apart in just a month. I hope customer service is good about this."
5,Perfect size and protection.,I was a tad aprhensive buying this with the fear that this case would be too big for myManfrotto 190XPROB 3 Section Aluminum Pro Tripodwith myManfrotto 502 Video Head MVH502AHbut it fits perfectly with a little bit of space to spare! I can easily fit more plates and screws in the zippered pouch as well. Solid zipper and good stitching. I'd recommend this to other videographer/photographers.
4,Good bag and plenty of room.,"I needed a tripod bag for my Manfrotto 055XPROB Pro, this bag is perfect for the tripod which I also bought from Amazon along with a Manfrotto ball head. This is my first tripod and bag, so I can't compare it to other bags. However; the price is reasonable and as I said the bag accommodates all my needs with plenty of room."
1,Total waste of time,"Did you ever get trapped into doing something, you recognize pretty quickly it's a waste of your time, but you keep hanging on in the forlorn hope that if you just give it a jolly good try, somehow it'll magically get better, even though it never does? Then it comes to the end and you regret every moment you wasted wading through all that crap, and wonder what the heck possessed you?This movie is that situation.It is a pointless, jumbled, disconnected series of vignettes featuring mostly uninteresting immature self-centered people in boring, meaningless interactions. The quickie sex scenes are basically every bit as boring, meaningless, and uninteresting as the characters involved. The only one I had any sympathy for at all was Nick, and I couldn't help thinking over and over that he really needed to grow a pair.If you're into 2 hours of watching self-absorbed people be self-pitying and obnoxious, then this movie is for you."
1,waste of time,The only point to this movie is that it's a vehicle to show a few simulated quickie sex scenes.wish I could give it 0 stars!
4,Pleased with this purchase,"I'm amazed with how long these batteries last. They truly do fully charge in 15 minutes or less. The batteries have no memory so you don't have to fully discarge the batteries before recharging. My only complaint is that with regular rechargeable batteries the indicator never lets you know when they are charged, whereas with the 15 min. rechargeables the light goes off as soon as they are charged. I guess the important thing is that is does recharge any type of rechargeable battery. You just have to know about how long the type of batteries you are charging take. When in doubt just plug it in over night."
3,Poor quality images don't do justice to Seuss Secret Art,"I love the art work, but the image resolution in this book doesn't allow for the intricate details of Dr. Seuss pieces. As examples, in ""Lion Stroll"" you can't make out the faces of the lions and in ""Green Cat in Uleabourge Finland Subway"" you can barely distinguish the figure let alone recognize it as a cat. If you saw the ""Dr. Seuss & The Art of Invention"" exhibit, don't expect the images in the book The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss to capture the full magic of the originals. I am hoping that a higher quality book is available or in the works."
5,Surprise,"The art in this book is much different from what I expected from Dr. Seuss, but not in a bad way. This book gives a new insight into his mind. I particularly enjoyed the sculptures because it really brought life to some of the characters that he has come up with. For all Seuss fans, I hightly recommend this one."
3,Not a coffee table book!,"Coffee table books in my opinion are large, heavy books. This is thin and should be listed as a regular book. Ordered for a teacher who loves coffee table books for the fun photos and info and had to return. On the other hand, if you love Dr. Seuss this has the cool back room art you don't normally see. So good if you're interested in the other side of Seuss besides Hop on Pop."
4,western woman,This is a very nice book. I would mind having any of his art hanging on my walls. My favorite pictures are Western Woman and Lonely.
3,Review of Secret art of Dr Seuss,Read before giving it as a gift. Knew what to expect and it lived up to the expectations.
2,Meh.,"I was expecting a lot more from the videos from Goo. There are a few good ones such as Dirty Boots and Kool Thing, but the rest are nothing more than bland lo-fi recordings of the members of Sonic Youth."
1,Not a Fan of the Misty Mate Fan Ring,"I have used other Misty Mate products and have always been pleased with them so when I saw this fan ring I ordered it. The ideal looks great, a ring that can be mounted on the front of your fan to put out a cool mist. At every point that there was a tube to a connector, it leaked. The spray nozzles also dripped and in my attempt to tighten them, one broke off (they are plastic). I ended up cutting off the end of each section of tubing and reconnecting it and eliminated the nozzle section that broke off. This made it functional. I only paid 11.99 for it so it was not a major investment and not worth the effort to return it. I would definitely not recommend this product."
5,"A Classic Bedtime Story in the Style of Sendak's, Where the Wild Things Are","Humphrey's Bear is a classic award-winning bedtime tale very much in the style of Mauric Sendak's, Where the Wild Things Are. It is the story of a young boy named Humphrey who, much to his father's dismay, goes to bed with his teddy bear. As he dreams, Humphrey's front yard becomes the setting for a seafaring adventure in which his teddy bear becomes a large and rather bossy shipmate.Humphrey's Bear has a rich and colorful text which makes it perfect for sharing as a read-aloud story. The text is complimented nicely by dark illustrations which evoke a sense of mystery and adventure.My four-year-old daughter really enjoys listening to me read this book. She isn't bothered by the fact that the teddy bear becomes a bossy bloke, and it doesn't bother her that Humphrey awakens to find his father holding the bear, as if he was planning to take it away as his son slept. Maybe these are things that only an adult would notice."
1,Can't believe that I wasted any time here,"I can't believe that a publisher actually would publish this thing, I hesitate to call it a book. Every other sentance is '... it was like ...' The story is told from a 3rd party viewpoint but he jumps into and out of the perspective. Not to mention that the main character appears to be a manifestation of the authors over inflated ego. He makes the character a super hero of sorts but it is transpartenly thin by the use of the 3rd person taling about himself that he is only stroking his own ego. The story appears to be a collection of short stories woven together by the thinest of threads. It is a shame that they killed a tree to print this garbage."
5,A very plot heavy book.,"This book was incredible. It had every thing from geneticly designed species to little nono ticks that can rearange the molecular structure of just about any thing, and a amoeba like species called Toolies. Its Nuts! But at the same time it had a intriuging plot and kept me reading for hours on end. What really gets me though is when Sentry (thats me)gets his head chopped off by Hone's finger laser. That is just sad. Specially since Sentry is one of the best charecters in the book. But thats life. But in closing the charecters were intresting and actually had a personality (very vivid personalities)and the book has a plot where you can see whats ahead but you are surprised when something different happens than what you expect. I give this book 5 Stars."
4,A companion release to the mans 1995 Australian tour,Some of the sweariest comedy on my shelf this double CD is good value in that it all comes from his Australian tour of 1995 - apparently Perth. As such it is all coherent rather than being and odds 'n' sods collection of bits and pieces from all over his quite lengthy comedic career.Delivered all in his conversational style the stories he relays to his audience are delightfully stupid in essence and run the gamut from discussion of serial killers to pythagoras! Certainly a broad enough platter for any comedian to draw inspiration from.While this product is showing up as discontinued on this site if you really want to score yourself a copy of this quite funny show then you should dig around a bit - Connolly has been quite popular in Australia for many years now and enough copies of this were lurking around at the time that I'm sure this must be available somewhere.
2,Stupid Marketing Tricks,"This slim manual comes with a CD rom and six ways to slice-and-dice marketing data. But the programs on the CD rom are crippled, so you have to pay if you want access to the more interesting features. And the features you do get are not user-friendly, not graphical, and look like a cheap man's version of marketing software.The manual itself introduces a handful of quant marketing methods, but in the hurried pace of a writer who does not want to explain the model and is trying to get their manual to print before the editor changes his mind. The models were briefly and poorly explained, with little business context. Might make an okay reference text if you already know the models, and when to use them. And the software might make a nice going-away gift to a new MBA student. But overall, I found this little pamphlet a waste of my time and money."
1,Dead!!,I was born and lived under this fool! I saw many people die for NO reson! I am glad he is dead! Viva Rey Juan Carlos!
3,"Sharp, Nice Looking BUT...","After we purchased them we discovered you're only supposed to wash them by hand. We're too busy for that, so we use the dishwasher and they have developed what looks like very tiny rust spots. Not a big deal, no health risk, but it's just an FYI."
2,Neat looking...and that's all.,"Seriously, for as good as their mixers are, their knives are really, really disappointing. Flimsy, dull, easily bent and broken. Within the first week of use, our paring knife bent a full 90 degrees at the tip and needed regular re-straightening before it eventually broke off altogether a couple months later. The steak knives are now following suit, and the handle of the chef's knife has completely seperated from the blade. Gah! Don't waste your money."
3,Won't last if you use dishwasher,"My husband made the mistake of running these through the dishwasher. They are over a year old in my kitchen and handles are cracked, knives have rust spots. I am trying the silicone handle ones next and I won't be letting them hit a dishwasher!"
3,I expected better...,"The knifes are a very deep and pretty red, but you better not put them in the dishwasher, they will start to fade on you fast. They could have been sharper too, I had to sharpen some of them immediately."
4,KitchenAid Knives,"We purchased this as a gift for someone. The price was right and ordering it on Amazon was easy. We had it shipped directly, she seems to like them quite a bit."
1,false advertisement,they show you the kitchen aid cultery that cost 129.00 and then they show you the 49.00 one when you see it online they are the same style when you receive the mess the 49.00 one is totally different and smaller I am so upset I dont know what to do jc pennys has the 129.00 one for 99.00-
1,Shift pad wore through in 3 weeks,"I would not buy these boots again. I bought these Teknic Defenders at a M/C show in Feb and within 3 weeks of light riding the shift pad wore completely through. I've had a pair of old engineers boots for over 12 years and a pair of Tour Master Response short boots for around 3 years and they are still holding up well.So I don't think there is anything special about my shift lever or how I shift.There was also a defect on the inside near the zipper that caused a corner to dig into my leg above my ankle. I was able to fix that. After that, they were quite comfortable and warm.The dealer from the show has been trying to contact Teknic for a couple of weeks with no results.[...]"
4,Should be in the collection of any Kim Wilde fan.,"Kim Wilde produced some good songs. 'kids In America' is a classic. Her remake of ""Keep Me Hanging On' is good. 'View From A Bridge' is cool. A great CD for the highway."
1,I did not receive this item,"The idiots at the US Post Office gave me a tracking number and said this was delivered, but the 8 dollar per hour fools did not actually deliver it.They send me endless email responses telling me they will look into it. They answer my phone calls and tell me the same thing.I don't trust the USPS. Send my next package with UPS."
5,Kim Wilde: HOT HOT HOT!!!,"Britney Spears, eat your heart out! Kim Wilde is the hottest '80s chick period. Her music is awesome, and her image is so sexy. Her songs are wonderful: ""Kids in America"" is a new wave classic, her remake of ""You Keep Me Hangin' On"" is still dynamic, and there are several other British hits on here that are all great.She is my favorite female vocalist, and I would kill to meet her. If you want proof that British girls are sexier than Americans look no further than Miss Wilde."
3,I've played it over and over and I still want more!!,"From the second I had this CD on my hands I've played it several times over and over and I still keep on skiping some tracks that are just to fill up the CD.I was expecting to find some hits I didn't remember, but there's no number one ""off-the-record"" hits here!!"
5,Exceptional!,"""You Keep Me Hanging On"" and more nicest songs of the 80's that is why this album is really worth buying."
3,Out with the Playhouse,"What a disappointment to all. Our kids, 5,5 and 8 found this fun-hut to be a not-so fun hut. Our 5 year old daughter uses the sleeping bag out of it. The rest was poorly designed to set up as a play house/tent..what-ever. It was not a good purchase. I knew I should have bought a different tent, but chose this one and now I will invest more money to get the tent I should have purchased in the first place. The sleeping bag itself is useful and durable, so all is not lost!"
3,"Creepy, but not too scary","I enjoyed The Legacy of Hilltop Drive quite alot, even though it wasn't all that scary. Sure, there are some creepy scenes, but the movie didn't scare me. Despite this I liked the film, in which a kid goes to stay with her grandparents and gets spooked out. There aren't many times when special effects are used, but the one main time when they are really makes you jump! There are quite a few scenes that remeind you of ones from The Exorcist and Poltergiest, and even though they have been done before they are still quite spooky. Quite a good film."
5,Boo! I,"I saw this movie years ago,when it first came out.My brother lived in Houston,Texas and knew exactly where this house was.He promised to take me to see it.He passed away in 2001 never having the chance to take me to section 12.My mothers' relatives could see the dead. That is what made me watch the movie. I also have the book.I only thing I missed in the movie was all the relatives that died of cancer were not shown."
4,Watch Box Holder,"My husband was thrilled with this box to hold all of his watches. You might think he has 20 arms to put them all on. Now he is able to keep them clean, safe and tidy. What a concept!!"
3,Not needed on a 1995 Suburban with 7.4L engine,"Even though it shows up as being an emmissions part for my 1995 Suburban with 7.4L engine, it was not. These engines EGR systems are controlled electronically."
5,A hero you can't resist,"To be honest with you, I usually steer clear of romances with babies in them. But I couldn't resist reading Tina Leonard's book after seeing the book previewed in Romantic Times. And I was not disappointed--the hero is ""such a guy"" that he will steal your heart away. Why can't every town have a Brant Durning? I loved this story so much, I nominated it for Romance Writers of America's ""Book of the Year""."
5,Excellent Pump,This pump performs very well. Installation is easy and it worked first time. Very well made.
4,Aspie (and all) marriages are works in progress,"In this book a woman tells of the joys and struggles of living with a husband and children who have Asperger Syndrome. She also draws on the experiences of others who have had lived with ""Aspie"" partners. She honestly describes her own difficulties understanding and translating her husband's reactions into her own more emotionally demonstrative frame of reference.I got the impression that she would have liked her husband to write more about his perspective on their relationship. He does give some information but he is not an ""express your emotions"" type of guy.I have refered several people to this book. It is good for individuals who are learning to appreciate and deal with a family member with Aspergers. At the same time this book has something to say for any couple who despite vast differences, strive to understand each other and make a long term relationship work."
1,Worthless,"This books reviews were misleading. This is not a ""self help"" book. It is more of a technical book. I returned this book which was a total waste of money."
5,"Outstanding photos, great reading!!","I checked this out from the local library a couple years ago, went to find it at numerous book stores only to learn it was out of print. Amazon was able to find it, it is a wonderful coffee table book, anyone that opens it becomes glued to it. The photographs are beautiful, the stories are great to read. It comes with maps detailing miles of old timber rails, I have been able to find some of the old grades using the maps. If your a railroad buff, this is a must have!!"
3,For Promotional Use Only? Not For Sale?,"This album was released in April, I ordered it here in June and it finally arrived in July. I opened the package to find that what I had paid in excess of $20 for was a promo version (not for sale!!) that didn't even have every song listed on the CD! I have been ordering from Amazon for 7 or 8 years now and I can honestly say that this is the first time that I have been disappointed in an Amazon purchase. I will try and find a legitimate copy of this album and try to forget the money already wasted in this endeavour. I will think twice about ordering music from Amazon in the future.As far as what of the album is there on my CD? It rocks, just as I knew it would. I bet the songs left off my CD rock too. If you want to find out, DON'T buy it from Amazon."
3,ATTN K. MCDONALD,"K. MCDONALD, can you share with us who you bought this from so we won't make the same mistake? Help ah brotha out!"
5,One small book leads to another very big BOOK,"I found this book by reading a new effort by Anne Rice about the childhood of Jesus and then going on to read her reviews. In them, someone recommended this book. And I am so glad they did. Mrs. Rice is working within the traditions of the Catholic Church. But this book is working with true and abiding spirit. This book gives us a Jesus whose divinity is truly believeable and a Magdalene speaking with a voice of passion, intelligence, and a deep understanding. It's more than brilliant. I think it's inspired...by God, if you think that way. But certainly by all the creative Muses. I laughed and cried and smiled all the way through, and closed it sadly. One hates something so wonderful to end."
5,A big book in every way!,"This book kept me enthralled from first page to last. I admit I had to look up a few names and had to read one or two paragraphs twice (philosophical concepts I hadn't come across before), but it was worth every effort. My whole idea about religion is in turmoil now. I think this book has changed my life. I know that's a big statement, but this book is a big statement."
1,unreadable,"I was looking forward to an imaginative and in-depth novel. Parts of this are almost intriguing, but they become lost in attempts at Biblical language. I quit before ending the novel because there was too much ""And now comes a donkey. And with the donkey comes so-and-so. And so-and-so might be the son of so-and-so else. And now into the room comes my father."" Not very exaggerated, either. This is how the language sounds, and how boring and irrelevant most of it is. She would have done better to just tell the tale in her own way and get on with it. I'm surprised this got published as is, but if you can weed through it for the ideas, you might find it worth your time? Notably intriguing was Mariamne cross-dressing to become John the Lesser, and Salome cross-dressing to become Simon Magus. Definite potential here."
2,Not Impressed,I thought the writing was incoherent and rambling. The author used too many names that had no meaning. The thought that a female could hide herself in a male dominated society was laughable. I could not finish this book.
4,"Full of Cultural Detail, But Not My Truth","This clever novel is supposed to tell the story of Jesus through the life of Mary Magdalene. It is well written and includes a great deal of historical and cultural trivia regarding life in ancient Israel and the surrounding areas. I learned a lot and found the story very entertaining; however, in this version of events, Jesus was not the literal incarnation of God, did not perform miracles, and did not rise from the dead. As I am a Christian, this conflicts with my personal beliefs. I enjoyed the book and appreciate it for what it is. This is truly a work of fiction. Many Christians would be offended by the explanations Biblical stories presented here. I am not. People have the right to believe whatever they choose. Personally, I believe Jesus [Yeshua] is The Son of God. (And I think He loved Mary Magdalene very much.)Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel ""To Be Chosen"""
3,hard to recommend...,"The subject fascinates me. The writing style is superb. The author does a wonderful job of taking known Gospel stories and weaving them into this work of fiction with delightful twists. Time is easily lost and the pages seem to turn themselves. So why only 3 stars and no recommendation? The ending. We all know the ""end"" of the story of the Gospel of Jesus and I was very much intrigued as to how the author would retell it with a Gnostic twist. But intrigue turned dissapointment. I left the book with a feeling of: Is that it? Is that the climatic end of the story of Yeshu? Eloi! Eloi! This fine story deserved a much better ending."
5,So good to know,"Thank you, JRW, for your ""review."" It took a lot of doing for me to get a copy of this phenomenal book. Evidently, the copy my Dad got me for Christmas was one of the last of the Eio copies. It was top of my Christmas list, so he really tried hard. And now I understand why it was so difficult. Now that I've read it, I can easily see why a very big name publisher would snap it up. If they don't mess it up by trying to change it, it's going to last and last, like The Last Temptation of Christ or like any beautiful work of actual meaningful literature. Best Christmas present ever."
5,An intense futuristic thriller,"This is an excellent story. Gibson is definitely cutting edge in his writing with regards to incorporating technology and creating new terms. Everything that I've read by him has been based far enough in the future to be new, but close enough that the world is still real and not made up of flying cars and alien races. In other words, cyberpunk but try not to get the negative feelings about that word that a lot of people get. Instead this is an intense thriller incorporating virtual reality, designer drugs, new age weaponry, new religions and many other things which quickly pull you into this world rather than your own. It centers around two people: one an ex-cop and ex-rent-a-cop and the bicycle messenger. They quickly find their lives colliding over the theft of a pair of sunglasses. You definitely should read this and other novels by Gibson; I believe that he will continue to be a driving force in cutting edge suspense."
5,Top Notch,"This is my favorite William Gibson title. Gibson displays a keen sense of humor in many small, wonderful ways. Considering this was published in 1993, and probably germinated and was written between 1988-92, you have to sharply admire such detail as a TV show called ""Cops In Trouble"". And this was before Rodney King, the L.A. Riots, the O.J. Simpson case, and the Haitian beating victim in New York City just last week. Science Fiction as a High Art. The Best"
5,gibson's best,"here is gibson getting out of his neuromancer series'rut (everything was a slow downhill after neuromancer).wholly different, its more like fiction written in thefuture than like fiction written about the future. hedoesn't stop to explain every little new piece of technologynor does he condescend to make every new thing somepolitical statement about the present. his most engrossingbook yet."
3,"Like other Gibson, only more so","Virtual Light left me kind of cold, but it wasn't until after reading it that I realized why: it is *too* Gibsonian. The usual Gibson textures are there, with a few delicious nuggets like bridges becoming squatting grounds and police state satellites, but in other areas his technology vision seems constrained to everyday objects like laptops and airplane video games. The real fault here is the incredibly light plot. Things seem to happen for no reason, and I found myself skipping ahead, looking for the next techno-description. Plot has never been WG's strong suit (quick, anybody remember the plot of Count Zero or Mona Lisa?) but the rewards for enduring it here are comparatively thin. If you're looking for post-Neuromancer-era Gibson, pick up Idoru instead."
3,"Not Gibson's best, but still pretty good...","As a former San Franciscan myself, I liked his vision of the Bay Area's future. And I always love the detailed landscapes he creates. I always feel like I'm getting a real glimpse into the near future when I read his work. However with this novel things begin to feel a little formulaic for me. His novels all seem to start with loosely related story lines that gradually grow closer together. Still, a very fun read."
3,Great story...false hook,"After reading Virtual Light's description on the back of the book, I was extremely interested in the fact that virtual reality was going to be a major factor in the story. However, the glasses hardly had anything to do with the story itself. I kept waiting for the importance of the glasses to become relevant, only to be disappointed by the dismal truth (which I won't reveal), and could hardly understand how stealing them could ""get you killed!"" Give me a break! However, Gibson's story telling is captivating as always, and his descriptions of San Francisco are splendid. I was compelled to buy another of his books as a result of reading it, and hope to enjoy it as well."
4,Future....Or is it now?,"Well, I read all the reviews, and was quity surprised by all the different opinnions, and i won't argue with people that didn't liked it, it is their point of view, and it is good that way. For me this book was great, the plot was just an extention of what i read in ""specialized"" newspapers, the characters where attaching, the technology was so damn close of what whe have here and now, maybe not his best work, but a great work indeed, i liked it and i just wanted to tell i liked it, as i liked all of his work."
1,what a snore,"zzzzzzzzzzzz. A dreadful waste of time. No plot, no story, lots of endless running around to no purpose"
1,Virtual Light: Did you say cyberjunk?,"You William Gibson fans have got to be kidding. I slogged through 60 pages of ``Virtual Light,'' then rang up the white flag. It wasn't as bad as Anne Rice's ``Violin'' (I got only 50 pages on that one), but it was close. There's a reason why much science fiction is dismissed as little more than weak plots and lousy writing, and ``Virtual Light'' is a case in point. The characters are cartoonish, the writing mediocre and unsubtle (Aaron Pursley -- gee, uh, is that Elvis? Duh.), and the plot about as interesting as a George Bush speech. In closing, let me say that I'm not an anti-sci-fi snob. I loved ``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' and ``Voyager,'' though not nearly as good, is still pretty entertaining. But there's something to be said for craftsmanship and intelligence, be it in science fiction or any other creative endeavor. Ernie Torres."
2,Waste of Sci-Fi/Cy-Fi potnetial,This book was OK. It was enjoyable and I read it fairly quickly. I didn't enjoy it as much as Snow Crash (Neal Stephenson). The main point of the book Virtual Light (?? don't get me wrong but I assumed this was the main topic) was totaly under developed and wasted. Some of the imagery was nice but I do feel that there was a lot of things that were left out. As said before-charachter development. I never realy felt like I was in anyons head. This seemed like a poor excuse for a novel from someone what would only get publish as he was before.
2,not enough Virtual Light,"I really liked some of the ideas in this novel, but it doesn't seem like Gibson really runs with very many of them. The title, the cover, and the back intro of the novel, suggests that it will be about this cool virtual reality glasses, but they really play a small part of the novel, the reader barely gets to see them in action. I liked the main characters, even though it takes about 200 pages for them to really meet, which seems abit odd. I don't think this is one of Gibson's better books, but don't let this one stop you from reading some of this other novels, especially Neuromancer."
4,They set a SLAMHOUND on Turner's trail...,I bought this book in paperback and I plan to purchase it in hard back for my collection and read it again (and again). It is the third book in the series (if you count Burning Chrome) and is almost as enjoyable as Neuromancer. This book is a mix of Tom Clancy and The Matrix. I recommend reading all the books in the series. I really enjoyed them.
3,"For cyberpunk fans certainly; for others, not a priority","This isn't Neuromancer, and in some respects I worry if the success of that book has spoiled Gibson for all the others, because he has put in what made the first book successful (dystopia, out-of-control technology, bizarre but plausible human subcultures), but somehow it just doesn't come together as well as his other works. The plot is all right for the first half, but it delves into the deus ex machina and contrived for the end and an entire plot thread involving a fascinating character is harped upon for many, many chapters and wasted. Not to say that this is a bad book; I enjoyed it a lot, but it's not a classic of the genre. If you love Gibson, then you'll love this. If cyberpunk-style SF is a sometimes thing for you, give this one a miss."
2,Not as good as Neuromancer....,"Anyone who has read any other of William Gibsons' books will find 'Virtual Light' totally unsatisfying. However, it still manages to grasp you until the 2/3ds of the book and after that it seems like there is a rush to finish the book."
2,Virtual Light lacking,"I enjoyed Mona Lisa Overdrive but Virtual Light grew tiresome. The plot lacks substance and Virtual Light, lacks any virtual reality. I thought with the theft of the high tech specs, the book was going to be an interesting read.Maybe I'm just tired of the quirky, ""tongue and cheek"" dialogue that Gibson and Science Fiction has unfortunately restricted it self to over the last couple of decades. The author thinks that he and the reader are sharing some inside joke throughout 350 pages and it gets old. Give me some of that ""old fashioned"" science fiction with plot development, characters and suspense, fear and challenges. The Science Fiction as well as Cyberpunk writers could learn something from James Patterson, Michael Crichton, or Arthur C. Clarke."
1,Just a bunch of prose strung togather,I agree with all the people who gave this book 1 star.I wasted my time on 30 pages of this thing and still had no Idea what was going on.It seemed like the writer was just stringing sentances togather.I know 30 pages is not much but it should at least give you an Idea about the story.This one did not. It was just 30 pages of confusing mumbo-jumbo.
2,A ripoff of Stephenson's Snow Crash,Read this before I read Stephenson's Snow Crash and wish I'd skipped this one - truly enjoyed Snow Crash but found alarming similarities - messengers as heroes - butt kickers as side kicks - big time money folks who are the enemy - if you're looking for this type of book - pick up Snow Crash instead!
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Your future may not be bright if you are wearing these shades.Gibson's technological level regresses from that of the Sprawl books. No cybernetic implants here, but old fashioned gear like googles and gloves for connections.A lowly courier gets into trouble when lifting the wrong pair of glasses - a super advanced gear prototype with some startling abilities.Through in a down on his luck investigator and another shady, seedy tale follows.3 out of 5"
2,"So I should give Neuromancer a chance, eh?","This was my first William Gibson read...I really enjoyed Stephenson's Snow Crash and I saw all the positive reviews of Virtual Light and it looked like a good book for a long plane flight, so I gave it a shot. It's a virtual book, alright: several flat textbook main characters, a whole bunch of superficial people drifting in and out, and a simple ""something got stolen and lots of folks want it."" Suspense? Action? Yawn. I did finish it, but only due to the long layover caused by weather problems. The contrived ending reminded me of watching a soap opera attempting to wrap up all the problems in two days."
4,Bridge series,"The first in the bridge series it introduces two central players, Berry Rydell a out of work cop and Chevette, a San Francisco bike messenger. Throughout the story the Golden gate bridge that was made unusable by a earthquake and now functions as a squatters paradise/no mans land looms in the background. This novel is Gibson's first tenative steps toward contemporary fiction. It works, just cutting edge enough to feed the tech heads with solid story and plot lines.Even though I still yearn for razor girls and console cowboys Vitural light was a great read. think of that..Gideon's Fall: When You Dont Have a Prayer, Only a Miracle Will Do"
3,"Great tool...... but come on, it is only a biscuit joiner!",I have used this machine many many times but never owned one. Yes it is very nice as far as biscuit joiner's are concerned. I have a dewalt that was given to me that honestly does a fantastic job considering the brand. The price on this tool on Amazon at the moment is 879.00!!!! Uhm buy a Festool Domino for less than 600. It is a way better machine and is so much more versatile than a biscuit joiner. Seriously once the Domino catches on everywhere the biscuit joiner will be extinct!
5,"Excellent, exciting, enchanting","Excellent book showing a great deal of beautiful art from the Taos artists at the beginning of the century. The book does and excellent job of telling the history behind each painting. The book is also very inspirational to artists. I suggest this book to anyone interested in art, anyone who is an artist, or people interested in art history."
2,Can be a lot shorter and to the point,I read the first chapters and feel I have wasted a lot of time. The basic ideas on UbD is quite straightforward that one can grasp them by spending 30 minutes looking into Wikipedia or other introductions on the web. But this book spends thousands of words to make it more confusing than necessary. I agree with some reviewers that it can be more concise and spend more efforts to give out practical procedures to design a good UbD lesson plan.
1,Arguably the worst book ever.,"It's about how to teach ""better"" but it's full of ideas that are an ok concept, but extremely odd to introduce and will meet great opposition from students. Also it's really boring and we had to spend an entire semester on it"
3,UGH!,This was a required text book for a graduate class. It is one of the most poorly written text books I have ever had to read!
5,"About nature, people and miracles","Miracles on Maple Hill is a story of an ordinary girl, Marly, whose dad just came from war. Like many of the other men who had been through war he did not come back as the cheery man Marly had remembered him. But when the family moves to Maple Hill, Marly's great-grandmother's old place, for the summer, things brighten up a bit. Being close to nature and wonderful neighbors, Marly wants to stay here forever - especially if her dad feels better here. And the miracles are always here too."
3,Syrupy but adequate,"This is a somewhat interesting piece with ""back-to-the-farm"" as its basis, written and set in the post-WW II period. Think: ""Field of Dreams"" but instead of baseball, maple trees and maple syrup is the common thread (""If you tap them, they will come""?). Also, the book addresses adult subjects such as psychological damage from WW II in a very matter-of-fact and appropriate way. However, the book doesn't really deliver anything extraordinary. OK for your 10-year-old girl to read, or to read to her. However, it's not on par with ""Little House in the Big Woods"" or ""The Young Master."""
2,Miracles On Maple Hill,"When Marly and her family move to her grandma's old house on Maple Hill up the road form a sugar camp, she and her brother have many adventures including pancakes, mice, flowers, cows, schools, maple syrup, and a hermit. When the car gets stuck in the snow miles away from the house, Marly, quite by accident, discovers Mr. and Mrs. Criss, the owners of the sugar camp. Through Spring, Summer, and Fall their friendship develops and Mr. Criss teaches her many things. At the end, Mr. Criss has an accident, and Marly and her family have to make the maple sugar just like Mr.Criss does in order to keep his business running. I don't recommend this book because the adventures that Marly has are not things I like to do. You might like this book if you like books about friendship and nature."
2,Missing Something,"This book had many miracles, hence the name Miracles On Maple Hill. But there was something missing. Oh yea, thats right, flavor. If you don't like reading those books with a bunch of the same words in it then this book is not for you. Sure, Marly (the main character) is young but still. I lost interest of the book near the end. Even though I do that on most books. So if you need some of that spice, then this book is not for you."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"This DVD turned out to be such a disappointment. I was expecting something along the lines of the HBO documentary on Club 55's pageant but instead got an over-produced DVD with not much appeal. I thought the editing and the split-screen slow motion sequences were unnecesary and ambiguous. The original HBO series showed much more nudity and showed the models in such natural states. There was no backstage banter included in this one, The original documentary showed the participants in a nude outdoor funfest. This DVD had them in some type of bikini with a sponsor's name on it. This DVD was much too commercial and overly edited and produced. Was not natural at all and was thusly a big disappointment. I would not recommend at all buying it..."
3,a bit too few...,"A lot of beautiful young black women. But they have been a bit avaricious with the complete nude scenes, less that a minute for each girl (Men buy this DVD only for that). And the girls keep on their shoes... The lighting is neither ideal. Next time, please ""pure nature"" in daylight, and without shoes!"
1,Could Have Been 90 Percent Better,"This DVD was such a disappointment, a waste of time and money. I wasn't really eager to see nudity as I can see that 24-7 in movies, dvd or cable. What I did want to see was a nicely produced event featuring the beautiful sexy black women that were on the cover. I prefer the title SHAKE DANCE, which gave an insight on the women and their stories. It's all about the production. I would not recommend buying this."
5,more than nice dvd,This is one of the best mid price production video featuring women of color. You get to see a little bit of their personality in interviews and see them strut their beautiful bodies as well I recommend
5,someone know,"ok i want to know the song that the winner dance at the stage, something like ""go girl... like dynamite"" what is the name from that song?"
5,Easy Solution for Wall Mount Center Channel Speaker,"This is the same unit selling for $29.99 elsewhere on Amazon. Install was easy, and it has no trouble supporting my hefty 32lb center speaker."
2,Speaker bracket,Not the best speaker bracket....I would not purchase again. Currently looking for a replacement
5,Brilliant ballad song!,"I've got Kavana's comment for this song. he said;""This song is one of my favourites on the album (INSTNCT), actually - I've never done a ballad before! It's about a friend of mine who died of cancer, and writing it was great therapy in a way. Hopefully, this is the defining one for me.""This is big ballad song. it makes you cry..... Kav's a great singer/songwriter!"
2,Not for families searching for Daycare Centers,"Unfortunately I found the book to be too slanted towards family home care or nannys - these are not viable options for everyone. I found there was no fair balance given to daycare centers. While the checklists/questions were comprehensive the author's overall condescending tone put a damper on the information presented. For anyone whose main alternative is a daycare center, this is not the book for you - save your money."
3,Most of this information applies only to families looking for a nanny.,"Most of the information in this book is fairly common knowledge. The book is geared for young parents who are looking for a family child care provider or a nanny. If you are looking for quality center-based care, I would recommend more recently written publications."
5,"Great rhythm, lyrics and voice!","I haven't bought a cd in a while that I liked to listen to from first to last song. Mat Kearney's voice is fantastic. Even when I haven't listened to the album for a while, I find myself singing his songs to myself... Recommended!"
4,Great CD!,"It's nice to know that I can get all my Christian CD's though Amazon. I had such a hard time going to department stores-they never sold a great selection. As far as the CD goes, it is great. I really do not like rap music, but this CD made me look past that."
2,Lose the Rap Thing,"Kearney needs to decide whether he wants to be Chris Martin or Eminem, for never the twain shall meet. Several promising songs are ruined by the regression from melody to rap, frequently - and jarringly - in the middle of an otherwise pleasant track. He has a good voice. Why he's wasting his time with the whole rap thing is beyond me."
2,Sedate Rap,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for a friend who mentioned liking the track, ""Nothing Left to Lose."" Two days later I was asked about the disc. I had figured that if an artist has one likable song, they should have more, and it's worth paying them money for it. CDs are the end of a long road, reward time. Then my friend played the CD to show me something. The guy started rapping?! I first guessed that amazon had mistakenly sent me a soundtrack to a comedy, but nope, it was the correct CD. Not every track is horrible, but enough to wipe that happy, expectant smile right off your face. Nothing left to lose? How about $6.99 with Super Shipper Savings"
2,An illustrious distinction,"I heard Mat Kearney's title-track ""Nothing Left To Lose"" and was intrigued by him. I though the entire album would be filled with the soulful ruminations of another singer/songwriter and I was right, for almost half the album. There are six songs on the album that are very good and show unique wordplay and inspired singing. The other seven songs, Mat raps along to the acoustic music. By making the ill-advised move towards rapping, Kearney joins a select group of artists who should never, ever, under any circumstances, be allowed to rap. The group is made up of celebrated entertainers like Rodney Dangerfield, Madonna, Lil' Wayne, Puff Daddy, Paul Wall and now Mat Kearney. Six good songs should warrant a better rating than two stars, but the rapping is so unbearable that the value is decreased. Hopefully, the sychophants that surround him will have the huevos to point this out to him and he will make an entire album with beautiful songs, if so I'm on board."
2,Disappointed,"After enjoying ""Nothing Left to Lose"" on the radio several times and finally learning the artist's name, I decided to purchase the album. My expectation was that the style of this song would carry through the rest of the album. Some of the songs do, but the rest of album is rap. Needless to say those songs are being purged from the music library as I write this. Next time, I'm checking out the entire album samples before I purchase."
3,Mat Kearney=Nothing Left to Lose,"A gift to grandson, haven't heard it personally but have been told it is great!"
5,awesome first cd- great music,"mat kearney's style of music is unique, fresh and new. i absolutely love this cd. i became an instant fan the first time i listened to his cd."
4,The next big thing,"Saw Mat in Richmond, VA as the opening act for Train. At the time, we had never heard of him. After his set, he went to the souvenier table and signed autographs to any and all. Even had giveaway postcards to promote this album. I got one signed and later heard his music on a number of TV shows (The Unit, Grey's Anatamy, etc). I bought the album here at Amazon and have really enjoyed listening to his distinctive style of music. Very easy listening with a simple straight forward approach. This album is the type you can listen to over and over."
5,nothing left to lose,"first off to the people saying that they hate the ""rapping"" he is doing in some of the songs LISTEN to the lyrics those are some of the deepest on the album! I dont like hip hop but i love mat's ""rap"", ""spoken word"", talking really fast whatever you want to call it!my favorites in no order.in the middlebulletnothing left to losegirl americarenaissance"
3,Okay,"Mat Kearney is a great musician however he is more of an MC than a singer in this one. The songs he sings on are good, but unless you like rap, this may not be for you."
4,Nice change of pace,"This cd is a nice change of pace. Great lyrics with meaning. No regrets purchasing it, however, it is a bit different from his other cds."
4,good music,"Heard Closer to Love on XM radio and had to get a copy of that song, so ordered Mat Kearney's CD. Love the song and the other selections are pleasant too. Recommend it."
2,Few good songs,"I normally don't post reviews, but wanted to here. I bought this CD just for the song ""Nothing Left to Lose"". I *love* that song; Mat Kearney has a beautiful voice. However, I don't care for the 'rap' style songs that are included on this CD. So if you're a fan of Mat's ballads, better to download them separately rather than buying this CD."
1,Wow,"After hearing his newest cd, ""City of Black and White"" which is brilliant, I also picked this older cd up. I was shocked. Such a great voice and then the rap begins. Yikes! For those of you thinking of picking up his new cd, good news........no rap! So hopefully he's figured it out and we won't have to hear him rapping on future recordings because this cd is junk. Save your money!"
3,Loved the songs without the rap,"I agree with the other reviewer who said lose the rap. The rap is annoying and ruins the song. He has a great voice when he's singing, not rapping."
2,Too eclectic,"I love artists who think out of the box and try something different in music. However, I think that Matt has tried too hard to be eclectic. Nothing Left to Lose is a great song, but then the album goes from ""poppish"" to indie sounding music then to what I wouldn't term rap but just talking. I listened to the album, and there is absolutely no continuity in this album. Just download Nothing Left to Lose and skip the rest."
2,Great Title and Cover Artwork,"I bought this book several years ago, and tried many of the recommendations. The book was filled with flowery descriptions of 'nutritional supplements' and their effects that in almost every case vastly surpassed the reality I experienced while enacting the suggestions. This book does have limited merit, but it was clearly a stretch for the authors to expand the amount of information from brochure length into a smallish paperback book."
3,Decent Compendium but Very Shallow Understanding,"A better book than some others on the market but still just a collection of ""facts"" drawn from various sources. Little understanding of the deeper processes or issues involved. I would have much appreciated some critical first-person reviews of the various potions - if the authors have the nerve to recommend a substance, they should have had the nerve to try it out themselves first - and the honesty to report their real experiences or lack thereof. For example, bromocryptine has a lengthly chapter but the authors obviously never tried it themselves or they would have painted a much more complex and useful picture of its effects. Nor do they understand what its psychosexual effects are - much different from what standard medical usage would suggest. Reads like a poor high school term paper from someone who did a lot of notetaking but little thinking or re-writing."
5,Walk on the dark side,"Her Galahad is an emotional rollercoaster that leaves you slightly breathless.The things that have happened to the characters in the past aren't pretty, but the hero and heroine have the strength to fight their way out of betrayal and triumph over acts of terror. I found this journey through darkness to a happy ending emotionally satisfying. If you want to take a walk on the dark side of love, this novel is a must."
4,An excellent debut for author Melissa James,"HER GALAHAD is a complexly woven story of the power of love to sustain through dire hardships and bitter betrayals. Tessa and David's search for their daughter is poignent and engaging. Ms. James' prose often reads like poetry. She is a rising star in the publishing world- definitely one to watch.On a side note, it's disturbing to know that HER GALAHAD is based entirely on truth. Aboriginal peoples have been unjustly imprisoned, stripped of their name and separated from their birth families. Ms. James has done an excellent job of proving that real life is stranger than fiction."
5,Wonderful Read,It's a fasinating love story. It really makes me want to search out more books about Austrailia. I'd like to find more books from Melissa James too. She immediately pulls the reader into the mystery. Jirrah has his job cut out for him helping Tessa. It soon becomes apparent their destiny is to be together. Wonderful book. Lots of emotion and well written.
1,Jiraaaaaaaaaaah!!!,"Reading the previous reviews, it looks like the author has a large family. Her Galahad was a chore to read, with every plot known to man thown in randomly in an effort to make the story interesting. I tried to visualise the love scenes but the combination of bucking, spasms, load roars of ""Jirraaaaaaaah"" and something about dolphins gave me a spasm of a different kind. LOL. Hey - maybe it was meant to be a comedy? In that case, keep up the good work! If readers are looking for a good Intimate Moments - maybe try Jill Shalvis."
1,Disappointed reader,"This review is based on only reading the first few chapters as frustration wouldn't allow me to continue. Tension is not created by the overuse of adjectives, overreactions and melodrama. Melissa, your idea was good, a pity it takes forever to wade through the waffle before you get to the point. Not only could I not finish it, but I'm tempted to return it to the publisher for a refund, just to make a point about respecting the readers."
5,A TOO TRUE BLUEPRINT FOR THE ROVE/BUSH CAMPAIGN TRAIL,"watch this film and be afraidveryveryafraidThis is where we are nowTHe parody of the Reagan staged ""shooting"" is incredible and bold, the send up of the phoney ""leftist"" nature of Saturday Night Live is right on target, the rest is just plain scary it is so, so true.even the manipulation of GOd and religion for anti-religious and uncharitable politics of greed . . . this we see today.THe reference ot his sheep-bots as his soldiers, ready to die in a war for oil . . .Bob Roberts is a prophet. Also get his EMbedded. And Bulworth."
2,Chilling little satire,"Although the script was written in the mid-1980s, ""Bob Roberts"" doesn't feel dated. Instead it feels like it was written today about the current state of American politics. The title character, Bob, is a conservative folk singer who runs for the U.S. Senate, but the cynical political machinations easily belong to politicians of any stripe. What struck me after watching this movie was how easily lead and deluded we are as citizens. While I thought that the message of the movie was right on target, I didn't care as much for the mock documentary style of the film. It kept me at a distance from the characters and, as a result, I didn't care as much about them as I might have done."
4,truer today than when it first came out,"I saw this film when it first came out in '92, and thought it was okay, but rewatching it during the 2004 election season I was appalled by how many of the absurdities depicted had come true, with cynical pandering and manipulation at every turn. The only thing it's missing are voting machines that count backward! The title character, played by Tim Robbins (who also wrote and directed), is a right-wing folk singer pursuing a senate seat, running against an incumbent played by Gore Vidal. The songs and album covers are very funny, and there are many cameo appearances.DVD extras include three commentary tracks, 22 minutes of deleted scenes, stills, 3 music videos, cast notes, production notes, a trailer and tv spots.Worthwhile viewing, good extras."
4,"biting, clever & unconventional","The first writing/directing feature for Tim Robbins (The Player, Shawshank Redemption) is a biting 'mocumentary' on the functioning of American politics. Robbins plays Bob Roberts, a would-be senator, followed across the US by a British documentary crew during his campaign to be elected to Congress where he will ratify the use of US military forces in The Gulf. The problem is, Bob Roberts is a fanatic right-wing racist already renowned for his racially discriminatory folk music.While many will be put off by the unconventional nature of the film, and American pride is sure to be wrangled by a lot of what this film says, 'Bob Roberts' is nevertheless a fantastic watch and a great predecessor to more successful films such as 'Primary Colors.' If you have any interest in the machinations of American domestic politics or racial discrimination then this is a film worth owning for repeat viewings."
3,"Starts Well, But Goes Downhill","This movie starts off strong as a parody of politics in general, and conservative politics in particular. It does a good job in its parody role, too.Unfortunately, the latter part of the film gets into uber-conspiracy theories linking all of the great scandals of the Reagan-Bush years into one massive plot. I'm unsure if Robbins meant for the film imply that there was such a great linkage, but, considering its very political nature, I must suspect he does feel that there is truth behind his fictional accusations. And I've grown quite tired of claims of massive government conspiracy.So ultimately, I'd say this is worth watching, but should be taken with a grain of salt."
1,A Staggeringly Biased and Unrealistic Movie,"The basic idea behind this movie is that anyone who is to the right of Tim Robbins politically is a hypocritical fraud. He creates a group of characters who embody the left's worst stereotypes of Conservatives and then proceeds to let us know what awful people they are . It's the kind of thoughtless agitprop that can only come from someone who's never actually met a Republican.If you've ever had a political discussion that was more nuanced than a lite beer commercial, this movie will leave you cold."
1,Socialist dribble,"If you are a liberal or a socialist, pretty much any left wing paranoiac you will love this film.It's entire purpose seems to be that of putting on screen all of the bile that spew from Robbins and Sarandon.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time."
