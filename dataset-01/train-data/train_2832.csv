2,rca whp141 headphones,"these new headphones use 2 aaa rechargable batteries, included, and only hold a charge for 8 hours before sound starts cutting out. i have an old pair of rca 900mhz headphones that need replacement (6-7 yrs old) which used 2 aa batteries and would hold a charge for at least a week. maybe the batteries are super cheap so i will try quality rechargable batteries and if that doesn't improve performance, back the headphones go."
4,Nice for the cost!,I purchased these headphones for my husband who likes to stay up late and watch TV without disturbing others. He says they are fairly comfortable but get a little heavy after some time. Range is good. Definitely worth the money.
2,RCA wireless head set - poor quality and performance,The wireless range for this head set is extremely limited. One must be confined to a room and cannot wander throughout the house for lack of a signal. There is a frequent noise that comes through the headset which is annoying. Overall quality is very poor.
4,Works as expected,"Plug it in and it works, just as expected. I didn't give 5 stars for comfort because, in my opinion, the headset was a bit too large (not snug enough) and they just are not adjustable.Sound doesn't get 5 stars since it's just not going to cut it for the audiophile, but as far as TV viewing goes, I think they're just fine.I couldn't rate batter life since I haven't had them all that long."
4,Works great! But battery problem.,"The headphones themselves work fantastically! I bought the headphones mostly for late-night TV watching by my husband. He can watch TV as late as he wants and I can sleep.The sound is really crisp and clear. The TV can be muted and the sound still works on the headphones. The headphones can be hooked up to work on the TV in my upstairs bedrooms but the headphones still work anywhere in the house, upstairs or downstairs.The reason I am only rating this four stars is because the batteries that came with the headphones do not work. Not sure if they stored them too long, they are too cheap, or what. But I went ahead and bought rechargeable batteries at the store and replaced them. The batteries haven't been a problem since. I love having the docking station to recharge them each day."
4,"Easy to install, sound is great, affordable.","I didn't expect the sound to be so clear at this price. My husband was very pleased. Now he can watch his neverending football games in the next room while I watch my home and garden channels. The headphones fit his big head perfectly. The only problem, he hears no background sound so if a truck crashes into the front yard, he will be oblivious. I highly recommend these headphones if you are looking for something that costs in the $30-$50 range."
4,Works well with newer televisions.,"Bought two for two different tvs. It plugged into back of one no problem but the other required a 3.5mm female RCA to stereo adapter, which isn't included."
4,Recommend,"Very good stereo reproduction. Set-up was easy and fast. Much less expensive than ""Ea**"" which require constant upgrading....new proprietary batteries, ear buds etc. I've ordered a second unit."
2,"they work, but not well",even from very close range these headphones have a high amount of statici'd look for a better pair if I were you
1,quality of product,poor quality in construction it is made China It is a little comberson to use but then I only got intermitent use as the power was intermitent
2,Malfunctioned,"Returned it for malfunction, then moved to a better Sennheiser model that I'm satisfied with. This seemed like a generic rather than a brand name product because of the plain box and simple packing."
4,If you are a big head this will suit you...lol,wanted these headphones to watch films on my surround sound without disturbing my neighbors. Great for the price but the fit is quite large and no way to adjust it.
5,RCA whp141 900mhz wireless headphones,"To me the double arch (across the top of the head) looks a bit goofy, but to it's credit the design works very well. So much for ""looks"". Of course the performance is what counts, and in this case, the performance is excellent, at least as good as or better than other units I've had in the past,(include wireless and wired types). I'm talking about sound quality AND comfort."
4,EXCELLENT iTEM! EXCELLENT SOUND!,"These are very easy to use, they come with rechargeable batteries so your not always replacing batteries, the are very comfortable and adjustable. They use 3 different channels for connecting and sound excellent."
4,Nice sound,"I bought these for my son because he works a different schedule than we do (we're first shifters and he's a second shifter0, and he'd been keeping us up late into the evening while he watches TV. We just hooked this up to the analog outputs of the DVR and now quiet rules the night (except between his ears). The headphones don't work all over the house, so when he goes downstairs for a snack, he has to turn off the headphones or we'll be treated to static. However, I still recommend this system."
2,"While it lasts, it works great (7 mos.)","Bought this item in mid-February 2012 from Amazon. It worked great--for a while. My family member who is hard of hearing (even with hearing aids) was able to fully enjoy watching TV and streaming movies. After only a few months, one of the battery springs broke. Had to wedge a sliver of something conductive in order to keep it working. Now (August), the on/off switch won't slide to either position--seems to be absolutely stuck in the middle. It is too late to return it--I will try contacting RCA via their website, but I am skeptical. Am not a happy customer."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"I can't say that I love it or hate it. The ear pieces are huge so they can be uncomfortable if you're resting your head against a recliner. The sound quality is acceptable but can exhibit interference on occasion. There is a lack of bass response but overalll not too bad. As you can infer from my review, I'm right in the middle on this. Eventually, I'll purchase a better unit but for now, I'll get by."
5,Great Buy,Can't believe the quality for price of these Headphones. I may be buying more. It was easy to set up. I would recommend this to my friends.
4,medical use,"they do what I needed them to do, I use them to monitor telephone conversationsbecause I am hard of hearing"
5,Fantastic sound!,"I shopped around awhile, looking for headphones to replace the cheap set I'd been using. I use a hearing aid, and functionality with it was a big deal. After checking out Walmart's offerings, I found positive reviews for this set and immediately ordered.I love them. After the initial battery charge, I've been using these for Pandora radio, my iPod, my iPad, my TV. Fantastic sound, I can walk all over my house, even in the garage and porch. Excellent headphones!!"
1,Transmitter broke after 8 months,"Transmitter broke after 8 months, replacement offered for $$$ but a lot of hassle. Decided to go with something else. DO NOT BUY!"
2,not hi fidelity,"i got these to replace my advent AW770's and i'm finding it hard to describe how much worse these sound. i guess these sound as if i put the advents into a paint can. i'm really disappointed, the advents are louder with much more bass punch and nicer treble. i guess you don't know what you got til it's gone..EDIT: for audiophiles or anyone thinking of using these as reference: these headphones have a crazy limiter in them which squashes the signal if you try to raise the volume. these were cheap ($20) but i can't wait to return them!"
1,Really Bad- Terrible,"If you are serious about music or even listening to music, these are the worst things you could buy. The crackling sound that is generated by these headphones is dreadful- this was the worst buy I have ever made on headphones and I wish I could send them to headphone hell."
2,Worked for about three weeks,"This is the second set of these headphones that we have owned. The first set physically fell apart after several years of daily use. They had a good run. After about three weeks, the set I bought last month started working only when we were within about two feet of the transmitter. Unfortunately, I have already thrown out the packaging, transmitter that came with it, etc., so I'll just have to eat the $38."
1,Unusable,You can only use this in front of the TV. Will not work through walls w/o annoying clicks & popping sounds and static. This replaced some wireless headphones that I wore right out. That were twice as good at half the price. I could walk around the whole house and hear them with no problems. I never thought I'd ashamed to buy an RCA product but I am now.
2,Sound and signal is excellent but,"First thing, this product has a very good quality.Second thing, I received this product as refurbished. They stacked it in the box (not the original box), not wrapping, scratches around the earpieces... It also doesn't have manual.Last thing, this product I received doesn't work well because of the On/Off switch had problem. I sent them for a replace.I am thinking to keep or not because the price is very good. Amazon should change the conditional for this product to be honesty."
1,faulty wireless headphones,RCA WHP141B 900MHZ Wireless Stereo Headphones. I sent the first order back because the batteries did not work after 24 hours of charging as described in the manual. Amazon quickly replaced the item and they arrived today. The little disc on the right headphone that opens to the battering housing would not open no matter what was tried. These are also going back and you can be sure I will not ever purchase electronics from RCA again. Shame on you RCA. Just how long have you been in business? I am 80 years old and grew up experiencing reliable RCA electronic items. May I suggest a revamp of your quality control?
1,Equipment Did Not Work,"The A/C adapter would not fit properly the base properly. When I was able to make it fit momentarily, the feedback was unbearable."
4,Good for the money,"Considering the cost of these headphones, especially as I bought them used through Amazon Marketplace, I am really pleased. As some people have said, a lot of the hiss can be removed by turning the volume up on your TV/Computer/Stereo and turning the volume down on the headset. As I only use this for watching movies after the baby has gone to sleep, the lack of audio fidelity is inconsequential, next to the bonus of being able to watch at a good volume. I wouldn't love to use this for strictly listening to music, as I think then you would notice the lack.My only complaint really is that the headphones aren't all that comfortable. After 30 minutes, I can feel some pressure on my ears. Also there is no sizing adjustment - just an ineffectual automatically-adjusting strap that doesn't really work for it's purpose."
2,The couple weeks it worked was great,"Used this for a couple of weeks and then one day I put it on and there was nothing. It came on but I was unable to get a signal. I changed channels, kept the headphones on the charger when I wasn't using them and tried unplugging them but nothing has worked since. Feel very unsatisfied."
3,They do the job but are not a Sony.,The quality is fair and the sound average. The material around the ear is a bit stiff. They serve the purpose but there are better selections available.
4,RCA Head Phones,"They Do What I Bought Them To Do , Give me the Ability to compose In Privacy! that;s about all!"
1,hmmmm that's a lot of static,"I know these are an inexpensive pair of headphones, but the cheap, poorly constructed design is only trumped by the cheap sound that is transmitted through static, or the pulsating power through the headphones that makes it seem like someone is messing with the volume control. The double over the head band does not allow you to adjust the comfort of the headphones, and they seem to rest rather lose on my head due to the design. Again I wasn't expecting much, and had set my expectations low, but do yourself a favor and spend an extra $20, $40, or $60 and get a pair of headphones that won't end up in the trash 5 days after you purchase them."
1,Do not work,I put the batteries in the headset and plugged in the base to charge the headphones but nothing happened. The light to indicate that the set was charging didn't illuminate. I left the set plugged in for two days and still nothing.
1,Can't find the right adapter to use it with,"I purchased this for the sole purpose of TV use. Needless to say, the adapters that come with it do not fit into the back of the TV. I have purchased several different ones and it would seem I need one the same size as the one the cable plugs in with. Cant seem to find one though so they are of no use to me. If and when I actually locate one and get to use them, I will let you all know. If anyone knows of the correct piece, please let me know."
1,not happy at all,"poor bulit quality, can't move the battery cover. I ended up with opening it with a screwdriver then of course broke the stupid cover.Sound quality is extremely poor, the endless buzz will drive you nuts. Really hate this poor headphone. Even the one I bought from a 2 dollar shop is better than this crap."
1,Does not fit well,"I just received my RCA wireless headphones. Iopend the box to find very cheaply made headpones that i found to be extremely to big for a average head size adult with no way to adjust for a tighter fit would not even stay on my head by its self, sending them back tomorrow"
1,find more info before buying this one.,I was looking for a headset for my hard of hearing Mother-in-law. I needed one that my Father-in-law would be able to hear the TV at a lower sound as he isn't hard of hearing. No where did I see that these would only work for one person and the other couldn't hear the tv. I have a sony set and love it because I can use it without disturbing the volume of the tv for my husband. It doesn't tell you on the box either. It is probably fine for one person who doesn't want anyone else to hear the tv.
1,wireless headphones,i bought these headphones for my husband and he did not care for them so we ended up giving them to a friend.have no complaints regarding the service though.
1,Don't waste your time. No stars. JUNK,"I bought this product for xmas for my son. I just found out that they didn't work. He didn't tell me and now I'm outside the return window. The phones don't work. They never worked. I checked the power supply and I'm getting 12VDC but the power LED doesn't come on and the phones don't charge. These earphones are junk. I buy a lot from Amazon and I'm usually very happy with my stuff. Although this is an exception, everything I look at is now suspect. I'll be sure to check out items before I send gifts. I can only hope the printer ink I bought will work. I'm not ready to use it yet and it will probably be too late to send it back. Amazon should be a litte more picky when they offer things for sale. I'm quite upset that I can't send this junk back.Bo Stauffer"
2,NOT READY FOR TV USE... DISAPPIONTED.,"CAME WITHOUT THE RCA PLUGS TO PLUG INTO MY HD TV TO LISTEN TO MY PROGRAMS AND SEE THAT PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THIS HAD TO BUY THE RCA ADAPTER PLUG... MY SON GOT OTHER RCA PLUGS THRU AMAZON FOR HIS STEREO THAT WENT FOR $1.60, BUT TOOK A BATH ON SHIPPING CHARGES... HE'LL BE GOING TO RADIO SHACK FROM NOW ON FOR FUTURE ELECTRONIC NEEDS TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL STORES. SO DISAPPOINTED. I'LL BE BACK LATER WHEN I GET THE RIGHT CORDS TO REVIEW THE QUALITY OF THOSE HEADPHONES."
1,Cannot open battery compartment,I have no idea how these headphones perform as I could not open the battery compartment (a common problem in previous reviews).
4,quality good,"I bought these for my mom, who is almost deaf, and even with hearing aids has a hard time hearing the t.v. She loves them!! They were a little difficult to hook up, but once we got it, she's had no problems!"
2,Very poor,This item did not work. I hooked it up two sources and all I got was a buzz. The instructions were poor as well
1,noisy and doesn't look original,"The box doesn't look like the same product sold in stores at all. Things were just thrown into box, no wrapping at all. No user manual. It's either not original or used. The one sold in stores has wrapping for all parts. Sound quality is very poor, a lot of statics sound on the background."
1,RCA WHP141 worse HISS I have delt with,I bought pair of these for game playing and OMG the static/hiss is so bad in them i end up with a headache. I am still looking for a great surround sound set of wireless headsets that does not SEND OUT SO MUCH HISSSSSSSSS> STATIC.. these to me are horrible for gaming and tv ..
1,blah,This product is a bit of a hassle. Takes 16 hours for the intial charge. the docking station is cumbersome. I was lucky and found it for cheap so it just barely makes it worth it but get a good blutooth logitech and save on the drama.
1,constant static hiss makes these unusable,"We ordered these for me to use at work and are returning them due to a constant static hiss.I noticed that the featured positive review even states, ""When you first turn them on ... you hear hiss but once you have sound coming through it disappears."" In actuality the hiss is always there, and the reviewer just stops noticing it when audio is playing with it; it's like tuning out the sound of an AC; the sound doesn't actually go away.As a video editor there is no way I can edit with these since there is a constant static that would make it impossible to edit sound. Even if you just want good quality audio for recreational listening these would be unacceptable.Also, the volume level on them is pretty low, needing the volume to be at full blast to equal what it was at half-volume on other headphones."
2,RCA WHP141 900MHZ Wireless Stereo Headphones,"Well, I had hoped it would be as good as another one that I have but unfortunately, it is not. It has static even if I am only 8 feet away. Sorry."
4,Nice unit to watch tv,These headphones are great with good quality sound for watching TV while the spouse is sleeping. Only negative comment would be the size. It would be nice if they were just a little smaller. Otherwise a good choice for the money
4,Great sounding headphones,"Headphones have excellent sound. Only catch is that they do not adjust very well. Otherwise, the price was a deal for the quality of sound delivered."
2,Not a good rating,"Unfortunately, there is a crackling noise when I move I head in a certain direction which is very distracting. I will be returning them and hope that there won't be a problem as I'm unable to locate my invoice. I'm not sure if there was one in the box, so if you could supply a duplicate copy, I would appreciate it very much."
1,They sucked!!!,There was always static in them no matter what channel that I switched to. They also did not fit well.
1,Wouldn't stay turned on,"I never got to really use these because the base kept turning off. This was a waste of money. I don't think the term ""refurbished"" is applicable if the product doesn't work"
3,"They Sound ""Wireless""","Maybe it's because I live in a subdivision where I can see no fewer then twenty Wi-Fi connections. Maybe it's because I have a baby monitor and cordless phone. I don't know. But there is a buzzing and popping sound in the pair that I bought. I also can here interference sometimes when I have my phone or Xbox 360 controller too close.Overall, they work for what I need and at a decent price. Once the sound is pumping through, the buzzing is hard to hear. I have noticed that when playing Xbox it's really cool to be able to hear ""where"" the enemy is coming from. Something that I did not get with my pathetic TV speakers."
5,too much to trouble to rate everything,"works great, great price, all the products i have bought are what i expected. but i don't have 16 words to describe each one. I should not have to explane every thing. I give every thing 5 stars. that's it. and now i have to title it. too much trouble."
5,excellent,"Excellent sound and very good distance, over 100 yards. Rechargeable battery lasts over 20 hours on a charge. Has a very comfortable fit."
3,Ok for tv,"These headphones seem to work ok. Sometimes the reception is a slight issue, but pretty good most of the time. I use them to watch movies late at night because I work nights so I'm up late and dont want to wake everubody up. They sound pretty good for movies but not very good for listening to music. When I try to turn up my stereo for sound it doesnt get any louder so only volume control for music is the dial on headphones which I dont much care for. But overall they are ok for the money."
5,My Savior!!!,"This product was my savior. My living situation doesn't allow me to turn my T.V. up loud, and I am hard of hearing. So, I bought these headphones.Although they didn't come with instructions, they were really easy to set up. My living room is big, and I like that I can move around and still hear. The sound is crisp and the headphones block out the sounds around me.I would recommend these to anyone who likes to have their T.V/Radio/Computer up loud, but can't. These are cheaper than most wireless headphones, but you get just as much as if you bought the $60 ones."
3,RCA WHP141 Wireless headphones,"The RCA WHP141 900MHZ Wireless Stereo Headphones have a cheap and cheesy feel to them and there is just about NO base to the sound.When first shipped I got a bad unit and had to send it back, but they did replace it no charge. Have been using it on my TV/entertainment center for over a month and it works fine as long as you find the right audio levels betwen the entertainment center and the headphone or you will hear static noise in the background nomatter how from the transmitter you are. Once you've played with the sound levels the headphones have a great stereo quality, yet tinny because of the lack of base, but you get what you pay for and for the price it's not bad."
3,head set,"Ear phones are a little bulky. There are 3 frequency settings to choose from, 1 didn't work,2nd has a loud hum, 3rd was ok. I have to turn up the volume on my stereo and turn down the volume on the earphones to eliminate hiss."
5,wireless headphones,"Great product, excellent sound, durable, sturdy, fits my head well (and is adjustable), good quality, good brand name. It comes with a re-chargable battery so you don't have to mess with those pesky triple (AAA) batteries. You do need to remember to turn it off and plug in the charger every time you are done using it, and that is not an issue for me. If you have children using it, they will probably forget to plug it in after each use and the battery will die. For me, this is perfect!"
4,Head phones,The RCA WHP141B is a good buy. It would be helpful if the instructions were a little more explicit. Finding the correct plug in is not simple is some installations
1,No Adjustment Whatsoever,"I bought this item , sounds good if you can keep them from falling off your head, there is no adjustment to make it fit your head, seems they thought everyone on the planet has a big head. If you move around they keep sliding off , this sucks. So i guess i am going to either try and return them or just give them to good will.. i would not suggest anyone buy these. They should have told you in the item description that the head set is NOT ADJUSTABLE IN ANY WAY..."
3,Good Price,The price is good. The setup was easy. The only problem for me is the volume. It seems as if it is preset from the factory and doesn't get loud.
2,RCA WIRELESS HEADPHONE's,"Great Price and they work pretty well really.We can't complain about them.They do get fuzzy if not charged-up so keep them charged,and i belive everyone would enjoy these headphone's.The Price Is Right And The Sound Is Good,You Would Be Surprized What you can here with these on.UP-DATE-HEADPHONES Stopped Working So IN THE TRASH THEY WENT."
3,Wireless headphones,I like it dose the job specially when your spouse is asleep.One down fall it dose make this loud popping noise out of no where once in a while .I have read it on another review before. Thought to give it a try anyway.Can some one tell me what is that popping noise ? It's not static.
3,you get what you pay for,"these are definitely entry level headphones, they are stereo and come with rechargeable batteries and a 3.5mm to headphone adapter. Note: the batteries require you to Fully charge them for 16 hours before first use then discharge them fully and repeat the process 3 times in order to avoid the ""memory effect"". I took off one star for the cheap batteries and one for the charging method of having to plug a cable into the headphones, although there is a cradle, the cradle does NOT charge the batteries. if you want to connect these via the analog audio out (red, white) on your TV or receiver you will need to order the 3.5mm to RCA Stereo Male Cable that amazon is showing as an add on item."
2,"Audio quality acceptable, lack of adjustment in headpiece: Unacceptable","for the price the audio was fine, I was not expecting Sennheiser quality.The headset had a retractable band that goes over the top of your head. They would barely stay in place. Not suitable for a small head. Fail!"
4,Met all my expectation,Was like the old pair I had replaced after 10 years. Used every morning and audio quality and t=range are excellent
2,it was too good,I got this wireless head sets for a gift to my wife she and I try to open it fron the side like it say on the instructions but it did not work it was stock I have to use a screw driver to try to open it and one of the 2 clicks pop the battery is not holding in place I have to use a carpinter tape to hold it in place I will not buy wireless any more and I back to my old fashion headphones
1,Refurbished headphones did not work,Product arrived and seemed to be poor quality. The wireless headphones did not connect to the base when turned on and configured properly. The sound quality was poor and had to be played at maximum level during the intermittent times the headphones connected to the base. I was very unimpressed and disappointed. I returned the product through Amazon.
1,you get what you pay for,"Looks great but i could not get more than just statitc. NO SOUND, and complicated to set up. do not recommend."
3,Does not work with Optical Audio,Check your TV audio output connection first before buying. If you have a newer Television that has an Optical Audio out connection these will not work with out a converter which is another fifty dollars.
1,Piece of junk!,"These headphones are junk. I really really tried to give them a chance. I tried to live with the constant static but it just is not worth it. Does not matter how close you are to the receiver. Buyer beware, these are junk!"
3,jacks opinion,"The unit is just alright. I am sure that the more expensive headphones are much better. I have an older model of the RCA wireless head phones and they performed much better all around. I have used them almost daily until they were damaged. I thought that the new headphones would be a good replacement, but they are not as good as my original set."
4,Good Value for the Money,"I bought a pair of these for my son so I will not constantly be yelling at him to turn his music down. I connected them within 10 minutes and they sound great, with range of at least 50 feet. I would say they are 90% as good as Sennsiemer headphones I paid 4 times as much for."
3,Okay headphones but ...,I bought these wireless headphones for use with my TV to replace an older set of RCA phones. These phones work well enough but not as well as the old phones did. There is a marked difference in the sound quality and the phones encounter a lot of interference even at short distances (under 20 feet). Well worth the money but I hoped to get the same quality that I had with the earlier RCA headphones.
3,Good price,Good product with a reasonable price. The re-chargeable batteries don't hold much charge. You will need to replace the batteries with two regular alkaline batteries.
4,RCA Wireless Headphones,"I am enjoying the RCA wireless headphones ordered from Amazon. They arrived promptly. Were as advertised. Worked perfectly out of the box. They have great fidelity and are light weight and comfortable. I wear hearing aids, and can use the headphones with or without the hearing aids. A great feature that my last headphone did not provide. I'd purchase them again and recommend to anyone looking for a high quality, inexpensive headphone. The only slight negative, is the head band size is not adjustable. I would like to make it fit a little tighter."
1,Busted in a day...,"Busted on the first day... After using them for the first time, put them on the charger and the cable connecting the headphones to the charger got jammed and would not come out (I could feel something wasn't lined up properly in the jack). Maybe this was a fluke... they were nice otherwise. Light weight and good sound quality and range. Just really annoyed about having to return them..."
4,Great Price for wireless headphones,"I bought this basically because of the price. It's priced extremely well for what it is. Mine was new and open box, and had some scratches, but being the first wireless headphones, I thought, who cares. This is a cheaper unit. The sound quality isn't that great, but it's not that bad either. I use this for a TV in my bedroom, so I didn't expect or need much. More of a trial than anything. I'm not disappointed either. It's powered via two AAA batteries and charges via a cord you have to plug in. If you are looking at a basic unit, this works well!"
2,Advertised as new,"The head phones were advertised as new and had definitely been used. They had a stain on an earpiece, stains on the piece that rests on your head,and the directions had been copied on a single piece of white paper with print so small that you could barely read it. They were also packaged looselyin the box. They work but were not new."
2,Poor quality.,"I got the RCA WHP141 wireless headphones as a Christmas gift, and the quality is poor.I originally had a pair of JVC 900 MHZ wireless headphones for about eight years, and the quality of the audio from my computer was very good. You periodically would get a little static here and there, but it was minimal.The RCA WHP141 headphones generate a constant background static when I try and use them with my computer. Furthermore, there isn't any way to fine-tune the exact frequency you are operating at. (This can be helpful, especially in situations where neighbors have other wireless devices set to a similar frequency.)IMHO, these aren't good at all. You can probably find better remote headphones out there. (It's possible you may luck out and they might work for whatever application you're using them for, but at best, it's a crapshoot.)"
5,WHP141 Works with '04 Durango,"I purchase a set of these to try with my overhead DVD player on my 2004 Dodge Durango and they work great! They replace the factory MOPAR RF headphones (P/N 04685936AE) which sell for $110 at the dealer. The RCA are the same Freq 912.5 MHz. (Note, I do not use the transmitter that came with them, the overhead DVD acts as the 912.5 MHz transmitter)."
1,Fire hazard..very hot batteries!,Loved the sound. Noticed burning smell while they were recharging. The batteries were extremely hot and melting their compartment. Very scarey and disappointing as I really liked these wireless headsets. Returned them ASAP. Afraid they would burn the house down.
2,One doesn't work well.,I am having trouble with one of the two headphones I ordered. The other one seems to work perfectly. I am going to swap locations to see if one of my tv's is not sending the right signals via the headphone jack.RCA WHP141B 900 MHZ Wireless Stero Headphones - Factory ReconditionedUpdate: Both units appear to be working normally now.
3,They are Better than the Sony,I bought the Sony and after a few months lost one side. Bought these. They are big and bulky and the battery fit was defective and loose and intermittant. Had to tape the batteries in place but they now work OK.
3,NICE HEADPHONE,"I WAS EXCITED WHEN I GOT THEM BUT I COULDN'T USE THEM UNTIL I BOUGHT THE WIRE THAT GOES TO AN RCA TO STEREO SO I HAD TO WAIT ANOTHER WEEK UNTIL THEY ARRIVE. THEY WORK FINE , THE AUDIO IS VERY CLEAR... I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"Despite the many negative reviews on this item, I decided to try it out. What a horrible product! How can a company come out with this garbage? The hiss is horrible. There is NO REASON you should have to do anything such as increase the volume of your stereo in order to minimize the hiss. The hiss shouldn't be there at any volume, but it is! Don't bother to buy this, unless you feel like experimenting with it. The manufacturer needs to properly shield this item to avoid that intolerable hiss."
2,noisy and height not adjustable,1. noisy (background white noise + intermittent diconnection and reconnection with a short loud sound that feels like slapping ears)2. height is fixed and I cannot make it fit my head
2,quality is weak,"can be alot of background static, always at least a little when using with my computers, have tried all 3 different settings and different locations"
5,RCA WHP141B 900MHZ Wireless Stereo Headphones,"These RCA wireless head phones are ideal for wearing while watching television or listening to stereo music that isn't appreciated or even aggravating to others in the home. There are a number of examples that I could provide, but, I'm sure that each of you could probably top mine. Essentially, however, it allows me to watch a television show, listen to it clearly, while my wife is in the same room reading a novel on her Amazon Kindle in absolute silence. It has been a great innovation in our life style!SMS"
1,worst purchase ever,"These things worked for approximately 3 minutes, i kid you not. They are total crap both in quality and design. They're clunky and are not garbage. I wouldn't suggest anyone buy them. I guess that's what i get for buying cheap ones."
1,Do Not Buy,"Bought this product a few months ago and after only using them a handful of times, headphones stopped working... Dont waste your money!!"
2,RCA WHP141B 900MZH,"They don't work. I bought them to use with my tv. The only reception I get is with the radio, and that is not the best reception."
2,NOT NEW,"claimed NEW but nothing packaged, I don't think it was new! Box looked like a Chinese copy and headphones worked like one too."
3,Ok product,"""It's an ok product. Worth the price but don't keep expectations high for that price. The voice quality is not very good. Just ok. Hissing sound whenever there is silence. Plus it was not clear how to connect it to a HDTV, found it very difficult how to proceed when I saw there was no headphone jack on my HDTV. Google helped with that but I wish the sound quality was better."""
4,RCA WHP141 Wireless Stereo Headphones,"The RCA headphones really resolved our TV viewing problems. My husbandis hard of hearing and used to blast our TV volume to the point that Iwas unable to join him to watch our favorite programs. No batteries,they are rechargable! He feels completely comfortable wearing them.He usually uses them for several days before recharging. RCA is a rep-utable and reliable brand. We whole heartedly recommend these head-phones."
3,charging light goes out,When I first got the headphones they worked just fine- did exactly what I expected. However the red power light goes out after a while which seems to me is an indication that it isn't working. After a while of leaving it unplugged it will go on ( for a while) upon re-plugging.I'm going to re-try to see if its not working before contacting the supplier.If it is OK the headphones should have a better rating; if they don't work a lower one.
3,Worked pretty well while they lasted.,These worked decently. There was a whooshing noise while they were on. It was sort of a white noise that was always there. It was minimized by turning the headphone volume down and the TV volume up. They stopped working altogether after a few months.
1,PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!,THE TRANSMITTER WON'T EVEN POWER UP. CAN'T EVEN TEST OUT THE HEADPHONES TO HEAR HOW THEY SOUND. DEFINITELY WILL BE RETURNING. DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Dissappointed,"No matter what channel I use, there is a snap, crackle and pop. They are made for a much bigger head and the band is not adjustable. They fall off if I am doing anything but standing upright."
5,Great Wireless Phones,Wow I have nothing but good things to say about these wireless phones.As long as you keep the input level up to a good strong level they will sound great! They work for about 6 hours on a charge.Be sure to wait until they have fully dischargedand let them charge for about 6 to 8 hours.The tone is very good on these phones.I can play music on my PC and walk allthe way out in my yard and they still work ! They are a very good deal for the price !
3,Some crackling,"For the price, they do transmit sound wirelessly. But they do have some cracking and popping to them, but not something to overwhelm the sound. They are loud to others in a quiet room, but to be fair I have bag hearing and have to turn them up a bit. I bought them primarily to use to watch TV with while my wife had to work or vice versa since out tv is next to our office. It works great in this regard, but if she is sitting next to me reading, she can hear the sound in the background.I know that these aren't noise cancelling, and didn't expect them to be but it's just something I wanted to make known to others if they thought that this item was."
1,Headphones were DOA,Headphones were a disappointment. They did not operate on arrival. The instructions stated I needed to charge the headphnes for 8 to 10 hours which I did. U I also needed to purchase a cable extender so I could connect these headphones to my tv. Those cost $15.00 which I cant get back.
1,RCA wireless headphones,I bought the headphones and noticed that the RCA y connector did not match my cable set. I had one on hand and used that. Setting the set tochannel 1 worked with the PC and TV. The sound was great and range excellent. The next day I tried the headphones and they did not work. Itried to switch channels and tried to plug into tv and pc with no luck. The green power light shows on headset and base station - but not thestereo light. Just wasted $50.
2,"""Refurbished"" Phones were Terrible","On the package, these headphones claim a ""crystal clear"" signal up to 50 feet. I couldn't get rid of the static and intermittent popping noises when I was standing RIGHT NEXT to the base station. I changed batteries to a brand new pair, I tried switching the signals on the base station and tried several different mounting locations for the base, all to no avail. In short, these headphones were terrible. I would have given them one-star, but I must at least accept the possibility that the claim that these were ""refurbished"" was a scam just to re-sell a defective pair without actually fixing anything. This may say more about eComElectronics (who I bought these from), than about RCA, but I'll never know.Thanks for reading,-CL"
5,Stereo Headphones,My husband finally decided on the wireless headphones that he wanted. He uses them at his office to cut out back noise. They headphone were delivered in a timely manner and in wonderful condition.
2,Not New Condition,"RCA WHP141 900MHZ Wireless Stereo HeadphonesI purchased this as a Christmas gift. It arrived promptly, but the inside packind was in very poor condition. The headphones looked used. They charged OK and seem to work OK, but I ordered NEW not USED. I order often from Amazon, but will rethink any other electronic purchases."
2,Low quality all around,"These were refurbished and no care was taken in repackaging the item. They were very cheap feeling, looking , and functioning. Spend a littler more and get something nice."
3,Haven't tried it yet - but mine was USED,"I opened the box and the headphones were scratched and the booklet had writing in it, obviously from the original owner. I don't buy used things. EVER. I was very disappointed. Disgusted even. But that's not an indication of the quality of the product, just the shadiness of the seller. It's charging, i will try it to make sure it's good then i will see if i can return it and go buy it somewhere else, NEW. If its not good, i will buy another product. I will post an update."
4,peformance is good - price is great,I read a lot of reviews before choosing this pair of wireless headphones. I'm not an electronics expert - so I don't know why there are so many complaints about hissing. OUR EXPERIENCE IS GREAT. These are being used by my teenage son who absolutely loves the freedom of listening to his music anywhere in our house; and I love not having to hear it. I am glad I didn't waste money on a more expensive product - these headphones are performing well and were a fair price.
4,rca headphones,"light weight and comfortable, good sound with no hiss. Only problem is there is no warning when the batteries are getting low, just a loud pop sound in the headphones and then they are dead. Batteries that come with the headphones are short lived so plan on getting replacement batteries"
4,difficulty,"head set was uncomfortable and heavy, my mom (who I bought it for) could not use it so gave it to my sister, havent been able to figure out how to use it on my tv so the other one is waiting for me to have time to figure it out. But a good value"
4,good but not great,"Wireless functionality: 5/5Comfort: 4/5Audio quality: 3/5These headphones provide a great value, but do not meet my expectations in audio quality. They deliver adequate sound for enjoying visual media such as a tv show, but I would not recommend their use for music."
2,Poor Quality,"After using for about one month I can't hear anything out of the right hear. Also, there is always interference. All 3 channels have interference and only 2 feet from cradle."
3,"""All of our products are brand new and have a manufacturer's warranty."" GSI","I ordered ""RCA WHP141 900MHZ Wireless Stereo Headphones"" and when the item was finally delivered, the package was in very poor condition as were the headphones themselves (had scratches on it and dust all over). I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my stepfather and paid full price for a brand NEW item, not old and used. I'm ready to send them back and expect a full refund for the item.Update: I was able to get a refund for the item thus added 2+ stars."
1,Frustrating!,"I just received these headphones and couldn't wait to try them out. Well, I can't even get the battery compartment open after numerous tries and getting someone else to help. I found out that other people who purchased them have also had the same problem, and one even resorted to using a razor blade, which I'd rather not do. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
5,great headphones,i just got these and they work great.they feal good on the ears and get good sound.
1,total junk !,"bought this for a gift for my wife to replace one that was getting ragged but still works great ( not the same brand ). unit required charging the rechargable batteries which I did unit would not turn on. something was rattling inside one side of the headphone and there was no protect for the headphones in the box, just stuck in a box and taped close. DO NOT BUY TOTAL JUNK !"
1,Huge disappointment,This product is a huge disappointment for me. I bought it for my husband to use while watching TV without disturbing the rest of the household.I can not figure out how to even hook it up to my TVI will be returning it soon.
1,disappointed,"I bought on October 19, 2011, two headsets and received on December 26, 2011 only one, moreover, sent a package without any protection and after the attendant phone service was very bad mannered saying only send the second receiver ear if I took a prior claim, that is until now not received the headset, I've paid more than 2 months and nothing yet. How should I proceed?"
1,crap,Sound fades in and out like waves and goes from one ear to the other making me dizzy. It doesn't matter if rechargeable batteries or regular batteries are used. Total crap.
1,Disappointing,"A few years ago, I bought a product called ""The Logo Creator"". It was an excellent value. I needed to upgrade, so I bought the LogoDesign Studio Pro. I figured that it would be the next step up in features and flexibility. Wrong. It comes with only very basic graphics that look like what goes into a grade school program. Nothing professional about it. To get good fonts and even simple ""swooshes"", you have to buy the add-on packages. I wasted my money."
1,Just Horrible...,"when deciding to update my current company logo, I thought - hey, this says ""professional logos made easy..."" on the box. Basically it sucked. Could not import any of my own extensive library of clip art, and the art that came with the software was horrible. Could not create a simple name logo without an opaque background, so what I created was essentially useless, unless inserted onto a solid white document."
1,This Is Adware that you have to pay for.,"When you open Logo Design Studio v3.5 you are blasted in the face with a large advertisement for a legal services website. And this is with the registered (paid) version 3.5.There is no way to remove this advertisement, I have complained to their support department and have been totally ignored.I do not pay for adware, however in this case, I was tricked. They added this advertisement and called it an upgrade! I could find absolutely no functionality improvements.Needless to say, I will not be doing any more business with this company."
1,"Inconvenient, bulky, waste of money","I bought this rig after nine years of cinching my waist with an old fasioned tool belt. It sounded like a good idea, but once I put it on I had a terrible sinking feeling. In fact, I felt like I was going to suffocate. The suspenders are too bulky and you can't move without being very aware of them. The bags don't hold their shape and move away from you when you reach across your body for the opposite bag. The bags are too big and I kept losing my Vise Grips horizontally at the bottom of them. The tape measure holder on the bag is too small to hold my regular 25 foot tape. The whole rig is just way too cumbersome and irritating to wear. I put it away after two weeks and got out my old 11 pocket belt. I will happily wear it and put up with the dents in my waist, all the wiser for the experience."
3,Take Carefull Consideration!!,"I purchased this belt set last January and I was impressed with how it relieved the stress on my lower back. I was also relieved of waist rot from conventional tool belts. The suspenders were easy to set up with the instructions included. Break in takes about a full week. Pouches do hold lots of tools.As hotter weather came along, the suspenders hold a lot of sweat (later they began to smell). But I also noticed it was very uncomfortable when the suspenders wouldn't allow for your upper body to cool off. My shoulders also began to chaf.As for movement, the system doesn't cling to you. But working in very close quarters, (i.e. lifts, steel joists, some scaffolding,etc.) it was easy to get hung up and scrape against walls.I am considering selling my suspension belt, but pondering the fact that its not a bad set to own if you switch between this system and the belt a few times a year. That way I wouldn't wear out body parts to quickly."
4,Everybody Is Different,"I thought I would like this tool system. I have all the same complaints about my old tool belt as everyone else. Hurts the lower back, makes bending difficult, etc.... This suspender system seemed like a good idea, and it is. Just not for me. I tried it around the house for a few hours and noticed that when I reached over my head, the stiff shoulder pads pushed on the sides of my neck, though these may get softer with wear. And that my shoulder muscles had to lift the entire weight of the bags when reaching upwards.Also, these bags are BIG and WIDE! You will have to be careful if you are a remodel carpenter, walking through finished doorways and hallways.Still, this rig is very well made and if you need to carry lots of heavy tools and want to give your lower back and your waist a rest, this may work for you. It's a trade off."
5,HOLD A TRUCKLOAD OF TOOLS AND YOU DON'T NOTICE!,"I HAVE BEEN USING TOOL BELTS SINCE I WAS AN APRENTICE WITH A TIE ON NAIL POUCH. I WAS LOOKING FOR A BETTER NAIL POUCH AND STUMBLED INTO THIS. AFTER I ORDERED IT I WONDERED WHY I WOULD SPEND THIS KIND OF MONEY! AFTER GETTING IT I WOULD NOT GIVE THIS BACK.IF YOU GET THIS YOU WILL BE SURPISED AT THE QUALITY, IT'S GREAT. THEN PLAN ON TAKING TIME TO GET THE STRAPS ADJUSTED, THEN WHEN YOU DO LOAD IT UP. YOU WILL FIND PLENTY OF ROOM FOR ANYTHING YOU WANT AND A VARIETY OF LEATHER HOLDERS.SO DO YOU BACK A FAVOR AND TRY THIS!"
1,good belt? cheap rivets,I received my beltless bag system with a poped rivet right out of the box. Although the shoulder strap and bags are heavy duty and well made occidental uses cheap hollow rivets which could not stand the strain of being stuffed in a box for shipping without having one pop. Return!
3,Won't know fully about product until after Christmas.,Purchase for teenager as present. I did inspect the box when it arrived and all items are included as listed in advertisement. Have no idea yet how it will look when put to use but I don't see why it won't work since ingredients have been commonly known to produce good henna results by users for a while.Would suggest 2 dispenser bottles and a little more ingredients for the price though.
2,Doesn't work properly!,"I bought the Henna Kit for my daughter and she has struggled to get the ink to flow out through the metal head of the bottle. We have tired clearing it with pins etc...nothing has worked. It has not been fun, only frustrating! And it was not cheap for what we got!"
5,THE ONLY HENNA PRODUCT I'LL EVER BUY!!!!,"This is the best product I've used so far for quick, easy, beautiful results. The quickest way is to buy pre made paste, but I've ALWAYS been disappointed. I just mix this up the night before I plan on using it (with the included solution) and it always turns out great. I also separated the powder and solution into 3-4 equal parts, because a small amount goes a long way. It lasts a long time, and the refills are a great price. The only henna product I'll ever buy!"
5,Great product,"This kit includes everything you need to create henna tattoos and is great for henna artists of all levels. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. I particularly like the patterns on the stencil page (one pattern appears on the box cover). Overall, I enjoyed using this product and plan to purchase it again."
3,Just got it in the mail...,"This is my first time trying Mendhi so I bought this kit to see if it's really for me. In the instruction booklet, there is a recommendation to fill the dispenser tube with toothpaste to practice with because, according to whoever wrote it, the henna has the same consistency as toothpaste. I did this and I had NO IDEA how freaking difficult it is to squeeze out a design! I'm going to have to train (as in workout & condition) my hands and fingers to do this.I played with it as much as I could yesterday and, even though my hand is sore, did some earlier today. I notice improvement in my hand strength already & I'm looking forward to creating some great designs in the near future.The package arrived quickly, in good condition with all parts included."
4,GREAT,"Watch out for leaks in your bag. Will stink up your room (euculiptus oil? maybe) just sitting in the box. Depends how you like that smell. Art stencils are transfers that look like a cheap xerox copy paper with designs folded in your box. Supposivly transfer with the oil, dunno they looked cheapy hand drawn with 2 tribals in there. Much harder than it seems to draw, much like drawing with toothpaste out of a large needle but you have to let it stain the skin. Directions say for 6hrs i did 2 30min coats and got a dark burnt orange look."
1,Just horrible - waste of money.,"First of all, the kit comes with NO instructions whatsoever. I had to find directions on the website.Next, the henna apparently is supposed to last a month, yet I used it a week after it was mixed and it created almost zero coloration.You also have to mix all the henna at once, so unless you're going to put 30 designs on yourself at the same time, it's a complete waste for this expensive kit for one or two designs!Also, my design lasted only five days, as opposed to the WEEKS advertised (and I've used henna before and it has lasted the weeks it was supposed to).I'm extremely disappointed and will never buy this product again."
2,Poor results...,"Bought this kit to touch-up a henna tattoo received while on vacation that was beginning to fade. Not sure if this product didn't wok because of the existing henna on the skin, but it didn't darken the areas we wanted to touch up, and then new areas we added on were pretty light compared to the ""authentic"" henna received on vacation. We're disappointed!"
4,great product,after i applied the henna to my hand i left it on through the night while i was asleep (somewhere on the directions it says you get the best results doing it that way) so far its been 4 days since i have had it on. it came out very dark like a mahogany reddish brown and is just beginning to fade. this a great product im still looking for a henna that last a month... if thats even possible. if your looking for henna that stays longer than a week and is very dark... THIS IS IT! :c)
4,perfect for a girl's night in!,"This henna kit is a really great addition to a girl's night in; last summer I used this with my daughter to create some really cool designs on her, ones inspired by the images in the packaging. Creates a very exotic look without a permanent commitment to a tattoo. Comes with everything you need to apply the henna and the directions were pretty clear and specific about how to get a good result.I will say that drawing on skin is a little harder than I expected; I found it was a good idea to have a few extra drawing ""tools"" around to help - clean toothpicks are a good idea and some q-tips for blobs or where you change your mind.The product does takes its sweet time to dry/set up so having a movie/dvd handy to pass the time is also a good idea.Pleased with this purchase and recommended."
1,Hard to use the applicator get clogged too easy.,"Hard to use, the applicator get clogged too easy. I'm not very happy with this one it just will not come out even. Results look bad. Maybe it was just a bad batch, to old I don't know but I'm not happy with it."
2,Applicator hard to use,"This kit overall is nice, but I had to give it so few stars because of the squeeze applicator bottle. You have to squeeze so hard to get the paste out that your hand will quickly start hurting. I would recommend buying henna cones. They're much easier to use even when applying detailed designs and won't tire your hand out so quickly!"
5,A Must-have for Post-Secondary!,Mark Zust is an amazing author! His advice is direct and to the point while providing the blind humor that goes along with navigating a path out there in the world. His views are well-rounded and accurate. I'd recommend that ANYONE looking to continue their education read this book!
1,Worse than I remembered,"I love classic science fiction, but Burroughs has written much better stories than this one. My biggest problem is with men of this time period trying to write love stories. Somehow these male authors think that it doesn't matter what either the male or female characters do or say, that in the end it's perfectly reasonable for the woman to fall into the man's arms and proclaim she's always loved him. Gag. It's also ok for the men to force the women to leave their homeland because, of course, the men can't ""waste their lives"" by staying. Since this book is actually 3 short stories, there were way too many characters to keep track of. And few of the characters were unique enough for you be able to distinguish one from the other."
5,A story of redemption,"A young boy is a pawn in a custody fight between his grandparents and his broken mother. While at first it appears that there is one victor in this case, the author draws out the complexities involved in such cases and adequately shows how no one wins when the custody of a child is at stake.I found this story to be one of heart felt redemption. While the opening scene pulled me into the book, it is the young boy's voice that forced me to keep reading. This novel is tragic, tender, and most of all very real. The writing is artfully crafted and the plot, while sometimes predictable, does not disappoint."
5,Strength in Character,"I really enjoyed this book. Brandon the lead character always was able to emotionally hold onto himself from a very young age. When he became a born again, thanks to God's Hospital, in times of weakness, his faith in Jesus seemed to get him through. He was a very bright young man and turned out to have a very good life and seemed to do right by other people. I would recommend this book to people that are psychologically geared with a Christian angle. Thank you for writing this book."
2,THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE,"I love to read, but the writing style of this book is so amateurish, it was like pulling teeth. Hundreds of names of insignificant people, and events that added nothing to the story. The Blake family should have hired a professional writer. A great story exists here but, the writing style is so annoying, you lose focus"
3,Introductory!? This is not an introductory book!,"The book goes over the basic model building method of data analysis, but lacks the simplicity needed for an introductory course. The syntax and grammer was inappropriate for introductory level students. Use Sprinthall...that is an introductory text."
5,Great price. Easy to program.,"I searched online for the Keyless entry replacement for my 2001 Nissan Sentra.I found one on different website for $59 but ended ordering one from amazon to save $10. I am glad I did, it works great on my Nissan 01. yay !"
5,Great book,"This is a great book! In the light of the current condition of the US, this book is exstreemly relevant. Suprizingly it was written more than 20 years ago."
2,Book not practical enough. too wordy.,I studied a B.A.E.E. and did a subject on robotics. I didn't find this book very helpful.
4,Excellent guide to the history of the dodo bird,"This book represents an excellent guide to learning more about the dodo bird, and its history. The authors cover historical observations and debates by scientists about the dodo, eventually coming to a consensus on what the dodo was and how it behaved. Full of beautiful pictures as well."
5,One of the best Rally games ever made,"If you like Rally and Off Road racing, this deep game has excellent graphics, tunning before any race, and a good variety of climates, events and tracks in America and Europe."
3,RallySport1 better than RallySport2,"The driving and scenes are more realistic on RalliSport2, but it's not as much fun as RalliSport1. RalliSport1 gives you better courses and better cars to begin with. It also seems like RalliSport2 takes a long time to download...more so than RalliSport1."
3,Worked for me but Strawberry tastes like crap,"I love Vanilla, personally. It rates 5 stars.I'd also add other items to the diet for some variety, but variety isn't that big of deal to me. I can live off a bag of potatoes and Louisiana Hot Sauce for a couple of weeks and a pot of beans and veggies. So Slim Fast works for me.What's the true secret to all these diets? Eat less, exercise more.No, apart from training the mind/body/appetite to adjust to fewer calories, Slim fast doesn't teach you how to eat a proper diet, but we already know, don't we? What baddie foods can we do without? Cut them out. Don't even pause in the aisle. Which are indispensible? That's all you grab from that aisle. Move on to the produce section. Dip into the baddie foods once a week; splurge. That's my plan, anyway. Figure out how to cut the baddies you don't really need. Drink lots of water. Do all the boring dietary stuff, but try to shift focus on to other activities you can enjoy that don't involve food."
5,excellent,"I am very happy what those verious artists did for the refugees, giving them their best and though they have been through the same, i hope they are feeling it and deepest. i love this cd and i am goin to buy it."
4,High crusade was a night of fun reading,"I found this book very fun to read. The basic premise of the story could happen. Although I found it stretching the limits a little. That aliens have massive technology, yet lack any real experience in warfare because of it being so long since they were opposed. The characters were entertaining, as was the plot line. The basic premise that a primitive, and superstitious people could take control of such a deep technology is a little absurd. But, it was fun all the same.Not a perfect book, but a very entertaining one at least."
2,Dull dynastic politics,"I never thought I'd find a Jane Lindskold book that I didn't like, but I have to say (sadly) that I really couldn't get on with Through Wolf's Eyes. It starts out excitingly enough. Firekeeper is a feral child, brought up by wolves. The descriptions of her life with the wolves are utterly fascinating and quite wonderful (Lindskold out-Kiplings Kipling here). But all too quickly the story degenerates into soap opera when Firekeeper comes back into contact with humanity.Years ago, it seems, Prince Barden led a colonising expedition out into the wilderness. Nothing has been heard from him since. However, if any of the Prince's children are still alive, they could be heirs to the kingdom. The throne is vacant and a claimant is needed. Earl Kestrel goes searching in the wilderness.You can write the rest yourself, and you won't be wrong. Dynastic politics and aristocratic intrigues are dull as ditchwater. Even Jane Lindskold can't make them interesting."
2,Sharp decline from interesting beginning...,"I read the first chapter or two of this book before buying it. It caught my interest and held it for the first 200 pages. However, from that point on the book loses focus on the most interesting character, Firekeeper, and moves through several other characters points of view. Why the author chose to do this is puzzling. None of the other characters are much more than cardboard cutouts. Why leave a strong, interesting female lead (when there are so few) to interact with several rather typical ""also-theres""?I struggled to finish this book and was very disappointed with the second half. Went to the bookstore and read the first couple of chapters of the sequel. Also very disappointing. A shame really. A nice (if not original)concept, but poorly executed."
2,"A fair start, but overly long and tedious in places","This was a reasonable debut, though it didn't blow me away. I enjoyed the premise of the female Mowgli, who is raised by wolves with the intention of returning to the human world, though obviously I think Kipling did it first, and better. There are also a few standard constructs that made me roll my eyes, and I found the text fatty and sloppy in places, where it would have been improved with a brutal edit. But overall the world and the system by which it operates is an interesting one, and the insight into the combination of woman and wolf, as opposed to the overdone wolfman, is fresh. I recommend it with a bit of a reservation. You might want to preview the library's copy first and see if the price tag is worth what you are seeing."
5,Wonderful!!!!!,"Through Wolf's Eyes is a Wonderful book, and one that you wish could go on forever. It is about a girl who is brought up with Royal wolves; bigger, stronger and smarter than regular wolves. She is taken in by an Earl, and many people believe her to be the King's niece; daughter of the King's son. This is just the start of a marvelous adventure. If you like animals, some magic, and a fantastic heroine, this is a wonderful book to read."
3,A review for her first three novels..,"I've finished the first three novels, and though I did enjoy reading them, my biggest complaint is she puts in a lot of description which I felt could've been left out. Especially in ""Wolf's Head, Wolf's Heart"" and ""Dragon of Despair.""I will get the forth one, when it's out in paperback."
4,Very intiguing. A good fantasy medieval book,"If you're looking for a book with magic, animals, and castles, this is the book for you. Not much focused on romance as it is more on adventure and war and the ongoings of Fireseeker. Fireseeker is a young woman who was raised by wolves and learns to adapt to human life with the help of Derian Carter (her peer as well as her teacher). Fireseeker is believed to be the long lost daughter of a Prince. Throughout the story, she learns the human way of life and the social structure of royalty. A very long book, but interesting. Kept me going while on a flight back home. There's a sequel for this one called Wolf's Head, Wolf's Heart, but I've yet to read it."
2,Basic story okay but a lot of useless information,"The basic story was okay, but I found myself skipping pages and pages of lineage information, succession information, etc. that really wasn't important. I gave it 2 stars because I don't think I'll be continuing on with the series."
4,Not just for the feminine hand!,"Being the first time I have read a book from Jane Lindskold, I wasn't sure what to expect. I really enjoyed reading Through Wolf's eyes, the end left me wanting more. This book is not just for the feminine hand, it's a book guys would enjoy as well. It has action, drama, and mystery. The were a couple of things that bothered me though. All throughout the book I kept wondering what really happened to Prince Barden and his people (how did the fire get started that caused the loss of so many). The other thing I was curious about but was never really answered was how Firekeeper came to possess the all important knife and the flint; where did the one who gave them to her get them? Overall I think this is a book definately worth reading. I look forward to finding the second book Wolf's Head, Wolf's heart and hope that maybe some answers will come to light with the same excitement and intrigue as this first book."
5,Interesting and true to itself,"I picked this book up as a lark not really knowing what to expect, but liking the title I thought I'd give it a try. I really was not disapointed. The book seems on the surface like many other fantasy novels. A girl is raised by wolves an must conform the human world etc, etc. However, however the book is much more than that Firekeeper is an interesting and dynamic character and Blind Seer just as thought out and remains true to his own character. Its interesting that book has so many characters, but I never really found myself overwhelmed or thinging that people were flat. In fact, many of the characters evolve in completely unexpected, but believable ways. You may finding yourself loving a character you once hated. The whole world is equally rich and full. Overall, I loved this book and speeded through it. The rest of the series is equally enjoyable and I would hightly recommend it to everyone who enjoys great characters and a fast fun plot."
5,Through a Fantasy-Lover's Eyes...,"I LOVED THE BOOK. I would recommend it for anyone and everyone. The history behind Firekeeper and the wolves who raised her is believable and a visible factor in the story. Many other fantasy books have the same baseline but cannot make it real for the readers. Through Wolf's Eyes, however, transports you right into the middle of the pack.Jane Linskold has a perfect balance of plot and characters- the characters are intriguing and well brought out, and the actual story is a satisfying length for those who love to read, but does not drag on for those who don't. The unexpected twists of plot and agonizing dramatic irony keep the pages turning!"
2,Love nest,"It has plastic on the inside. My budgies were not interested in it. And when I put one of them in the love nest bird nest, they didn't want to stay in it."
1,ANTOnline is terrible,"Me too. I bought mine directly from ANTOnline, thinking I could avoid the problem this other reviewer had. No luck. ANT sent the wrong color and refused to take it back. They tried to blame it on me saying that the UPC code was the same as listed on the website. Boneheads. If I do not get what is pictured, it ISN'T RIGHT. I gave up trying to reason with their zombie customer support and disputed the charge with my credit card issuer. When will these online retailers learn?"
1,Trashed it out,"After reading the reviews I decided to buy it as I was sure you cannot go wrong with the simple deviceI was wrong.Junk that cannot be even mounted properly.The parts cannot be assembled to perform the job.Asked my farther to correct precision problem so the parts will fit.Even after that, it is chewing on meet or vegetables and has no power to grind itI trashed it out. Happy scrap metal collectors!"
2,Dated and Tired,"With the whole disco genre making a resurgence via House and Dance music, this collection of songs by Cerrone take you back to days of champagne/cocaine and water fountains inside glamourous clubs. If you're into listening to ... disco sounds this album is for you, however you'll get tired of listening to the similar sounds that underly the tracks and they quickly wear thin.Stand out tracks include Standing in the Rain and Give me Love. Bob Sinclair should stop going back to past disco artists and make his own original music, like most other dj/producers.I suggest you check out the Larry Levan (Paradise Garage)cd or Francis K (Essential Mix) cd, or Mancuso's Loft compilations for a better range of tracks.ps: don't buy this cd for all those rediculous remixes of Give Me Love - they are shocking, and the A&R; person who thought it was a good idea to mix and remix one song over and over should be drop over the middle of the Amazon and left there only with a discman and those remixes."
5,Chain great durability,I got this chain over a year ago for my boyfriend and it is still brilliant and has kept its shape. He wears it everyday nearly 24/7 and it goes perfectly with its sterling silver pendant. Delicate yet very durable and great for piecing together jewelry that you wish to keep and wear for a long time.
5,Better than expected,"I ordered this chain for my husband. He wanted something that he could wear everyday with a small medallion. This totally fit the bill, it is substantial, but not big enough to look like he is wearing it under his dress shirts and t-shirts. The length is perfect "" dog tag"" length. He has been wearing it everyday for a month; so far no problems at all. I would recommend this chain for men and women."
3,The Word and The Spirit,though the title speaks of reclaiming your covenant with the Holy Spirit the book does not deal with that specifically which is why I purchased it.
4,"Old is Good, But not Better","Disclosure -- I am a big switchfoot fan. I found them with the Beautiful Letdown and Oh! Gravity which are excellent, 5-star albums. The lure of getting three more albums for one low price was definitely appealing. After listening to all of them many times I can say I am glad I purchased them but this isn't a 5-star purchase. The first album Legend of Chin could be left behind. Personally, I didn't get much from that. The second album New Way to be Human is the gem (as many others have suggested). Learning to Breathe is good but not great. So I am giving this 4 stars. If you want to spend slightly less (granted it is slightly since this is so well priced) then just get New Way to Be Human."
4,Switchfoot's best work?,"Although I haven't listened to Switchfoot's two most recent albulms (Oh! Gravity and Nothing Is Sound) I consider New Way to Be Human their best up through Beautiful Letdown. Learning to Breathe is also great. If you don't have these albulms, by all means you should buy them at this price."
5,The most rockin thing I've ever found,"I was just taking a leisurely stroll through the local wal-mart. I thought I would stop by the music section to find what was new... what an amazing thing I found... THREE SWITCHFOOT CDS!!! I do believe that these are the best that Switchfoot has to offer. They have changed drastically since these early albums, these are softer, but still rocking... You need this item... seriously."
5,What ever floats your boat,"Good, well-made float-valve. Won't fit my application (my fault for not measuring correctly) but otherwise nothing wrong with them. Easy bend-to-adjust float arm makes these simple to adjust in place. I ended up getting a float valve with a much shorter overall length that better fit my application."
2,I'm a simple man who......,"I must be an idiot, but this games controls are very frustrating. I feel that a keyboard is necessary to enjoy this game. I found myself spending half of my time looking in the manual to figure out what 2 button combo I needed to use next, and the other half of the time wishing I was playing Syphon Filter. I liked the atmosphere (I am a World War II buff). I like the idea of the game. The execution is too difficult. I am supposed to be playing, not figuring out the controls. There are some real nice features to this game, but you might need a keyboard to discover them. I hope someone enjoys the used copy I have made available...."
3,Interesting but hard.,"I had this game for about 3 days before I returned it. It had it's moments. The concept is great and controls are decent, although I don't think anything will ever top a mouse for a first person and third person game. Without some sort of auto help to aim this game is pretty hard. You just can't aim and react fast enough with a standard DC controller. The AI of your mates who follow you around is horrible too. Always getting killed or stuck somewhere. Rent this before you buy it. Rainbow Six is a much better game."
4,A great way two kill two hours,"This game is thoroughly interesting. Despite the fact that your troops have a tendency to be insubordinate and get themselves shot, and the controls take a while to get used to, this game is worth every penny. I would recommend it to anyone interested in a game that actually challenges you to think a little."
3,good movies/ bad aspect ratio,"both movies are great, only draw back is that one movie is 2.35 aspect ratio and the second is 1.85 aspect ratio and its not labled as such."
4,okay movies,"The mind is a fascinating thing....I remembered both films differently than they are....not quite as good. The DVD is a great buy (2 movies for the price of 1), and delivery was fast."
3,I'd like to review this prod.....Time to change your battery!,"Funny how times have changed. My newest laptop can run over 8 hours without a charging. My oldest, which now uses this battery, runs about 2 hours before needing another charging. And this is just web browsing.I'm not sure how long these ran when they were new, but 2 hours seems a bit weak to me.With that in mind I'm giving it 3 stars."
3,For Patient Souls......,"I've used this little guy probably a dozen times over the past couple of months, and overall I've been very satisfied.However, I am someone who is willing to spend about a hour cranking and cranking for about 8 cups of flour.If you're not in a rush, you want to tone your arms, and want a very simple machine to grind flour and meal and such, this is a good mill for you. Turn on some music, roll up your sleeves, and let your mind wander while you grind away. The simple, delicious taste of freshly ground whole grain flours in your cooking and baking will make it time well spent. I really like it.On the other hand, if you're someone who wants to quickly grind a large amount of what-have-you and get on with your life, this is not what you want. Output is slow, it's a little on the rickety side, and you definitely have to speak up to be heard over it."
1,Don't Waste Your Time With This Mill,Don't waste your time with this mill. I bought mine about a year ago but never really used it until recently. I gave it to my Mom to grind wheat berries for bread and she used it only twice before it completely fell apart and the pieces won't fit back together. Its a total loss and was a waste of money.
3,Grain Mill,The item came quickly but was not the brand name ( Back to Basics)that I ordered. Actually have not had a chance to use it yet.
4,good... for hippies and mountain men...,"takes about 20 minutes to grind enough for a loaf of bread. noisy and squeaky. coarse flour. good for an emergency standby, but anyone that uses this day to day has more patience and energy than me."
1,There is not enough time in the world...,"...to produce enough ""flour"" for any recipe with this item. I tried it with oats, which should be pretty easy, and found myself having to shake it every 30 seconds because no more grain was coming through. After a good 20 minutes I had processed half a cup at most and found a lot of oat flakes in the ""flour"", which is definitely a misnomer.Get yourself a cheap coffee grinder instead, it's going to be a lot faster (and yield better results)."
4,Seems like it will work well in a pinch,I ordered this grain mill to have in case of an emergency. I set it up and ground some wheat and it seems to work very well. Not a very heavy mill but I think it will do just fine in case of an emergency. The price is right too.
5,Wonderfully easy to use,Nice sturdy grain grinder. Easy to assemble and use. I don't understand the complaints from some about the effort required to produce a cup of grain. I thought the machine was remarkably efficient and took relatively little effort. Think of it as exercise for your arms -- you would pay for the privilege at a health club.
1,Had trouble - adjustment impossible,"Used this with Spelt and Corn. No chance to get anywhere with corn. Too hard. Was able to get spelt cracked, but difficult to get flour. It said you could adjust the setting, but was unable to do that. The amount of cracked spelt per time spent was poor. 15 minutes of cranking yielded about a quarter cup. Would find something else to use."
3,Does NOT make flour,"Folks, no matter what anyone here says, you cannot get real flour out of this mill. It does great on making Cream of Wheat. I ran a batch through 8 (Yes EIGHT FRIGGIN TIMES) and it will not come out as flour. I did use this to make a couple of rustic loaves of bread, but cakes and gravies are totally out of the question. I suspect that many of the people who are claiming one pass will create cake flour work for the company."
1,Vol. 46 What I did on my summer vacation.,"It's awfully hard to watch an average fly fisher who can't deliver a fly in the middle of so many Red Fish tails. Then when he does hook up, he has the drag set so light a small Red takes him to the backing on a 8 weight. I don't need to buy a video to see what I saw on this one. Plus, there's something wrong about an ad for a reel in the middle.The guide was very good thus the 1 star."
2,Don't Bother With this Pamphlet,"I love Kiefers other book, the POWERMIND SYSTEM, and I highly rate it. This book is just a rehash of; The Powermind System, Think and Grow Rich, The Science of Getting Rich etc etc. The content is not brilliant, it is presented in better form in the above mentined books.This pamphlet type of book is the product of a marketing guru, trying to sell a product by inventing an intresting name. I am not saying the content is terrible, but there are better books on the market than this, at a better price, which will help you in just the same way.Forget this book and buy the; Powermind System, Science of Getting Rich Wallace D Wattles, Born Rich by Bob Proctor or Think and Grow Rich by Napolean Hill instead. They will all help you more than this book.Not recomended."
1,This phone did not work,"Well the phone I bought from Hassle Free cell turned out to not be Hassle Free at all. I bought a razr from them and they mailed it to me, it did not work. Then they mailed me a replacement. It did not work either. The first one shut itself off randomly. The second had wavy lines all over the screen. I love the razr but ordering this has caused a months worth of stress since I am still waiting on a refund. Order a razr, but don't order from hassle free cell."
5,Pete Seeger Alive Forever,"Watching this video brought me back to the 1963 Newport Folk Festival which he co-founded. Pete has always been a master at getting the audience involved which enhances the experience of the concert. He is a great multitasker as well in the way he plays, sings, shouts out the next verse to be sung, changes his tone to better blend in with the audience without missing a lick.If you know about Pete and his life and are a fan of folk don't miss this video. It will keep the songs, style and spirit of this great man alive long after he gone, which hopefully won't be for several more years. Although his voice now quivers a bit he still puts his heart and soul into his work. I don't say performances because he does so much more."
4,Still good after all these years,"In spite of being a bit grainy black and white, the flavor and charm of Pete still comes through. thank goodness someone had the foresight to tape it - probably one of the first ever concert videos! Just pure fun to watch - sure takes you back a few years (ok, more than a few). Any Seeger or Weavers fans will be happy."
1,Waste of Money,"This is a very, very poorly designed, low quality product. It is NOT completely airtight (there is an opening on the top/front of the can) which causes numerous problems (odors, bugs, etc.). The ""boot"" on the inside of the can that does the compacting is smaller than the size of the can so food squishes up around the unprotected ""boot"" and you end up with food in the hinges and on the upper sides of the can that make a real mess when you open it to add more garbage. After using this product for 5 days with numerous problems, we also determined that it is a bad idea to have a compactor this large as it means that your garbage is staying in your kitchen longer (decomposing). If you really want a trash compactor, buy an electric one. Otherwise, spend your money on a SimpleHuman garbage can which is what we did after throwing this product in the garbage."
1,Amazon sent out old broken item as new.,This product may be okay but I'll never know. Ordered new from Amazon and received an old broken item. Had to send back in huge box and pay shipping to send back. Now am hoping for refund of item and shipping. Wouldn't you think they would check item before sending out since the manufactures box was smashed and old looking. Item was scratched all over and the main shaft cracked in half. Stay away from Amazon. As you can see I'm peeved.
1,do not buy,it ran for about 5 minutes before the engine seized. i had to find repair shop to take it to. had to wait 3 weeks before they could look at it. only to be told that it would not be covered. i had the right oil mix in it but they told me i did not. i called mtd the maker of the tiller and they gave me the run around. do not waste your money.
3,Good for small gardens...,"This is for your small flower bed or maybe very small vegetable garden. However, if you're looking to cultivate a big area, then I suggest investing in something a little bigger and perhaps a tiller that has the tines in the back."
3,Yard Machines 121R cultivator/tiller,"Must follow starting instructions exactly or it won't start. Works great for what I'm doing ( regrading a few inches of ground around house that settled ). Paid $199, $20 cheaper than Sears, free shipping and no sales tax. Good light-duty machine for the money."
1,Pass this one up!,"Yep, hard to start and doesn't work very well. Too easy to bury in soft dirt and to hard to break new soil with it. I've used lots of tillers and different cultivators without a problem. This one broke after five uses but I had owned it a year. Went out to start it and it wouldn't. Husband is a mechanic for small engines and even he couldn't fix it. This thing stinks! I'm going to buy a DR or a Mantis..."
2,Horrible starting,"This is the hardest piece of equipment that I own to get started. The thought of going through the starting issue makes me not want to use this. Once it's started, it works fine."
4,Pleased.,"This is a great value and the product really does work well. I don't know if it has the power of the Mantis cultivator I see on TV, but it sure is a lot less money and does the jobs I need done. The only complaint I really have is that the muffler blows back at you will you are working with it. It would seem that a better position could have been found for the exaust. But still a great product that works."
3,pull cord broke,"The pull cord broke,any idea or suggestions as how easy it is to fix ,is it worth the money."
1,***Cultivator with a Lifespan of 5 minutes,What a piece of trash? I'm sure that the manufacturer knows that this machine is completely useless!!! Just used it for the first time today. After just 5 minutes it seized up and won't start again. How do I get my money back for something that only worked for 5 minutes?
5,Great little machine,"I have only used this for a couple of weeks and think it's great. Light weight and easy to maneuver. I live at 7500 ft above sea level and the only thing I have noticed is I have to let it warm up for 30 seconds before using. Plenty of power. Would not use it to bust ground for the first time, too light. Follow instructions to start and it will start every time (sometimes it might take 2 or 3 pulls)."
1,Yard Machines 121 Cultivator,"I placed an order for 1 Yard Machines 121 Cultivator and received 2. I sent 1 back. I opened the shipping box and found it had no back wheels as shown in the advertisement, on the shipping box, and on the instructions inside. I called Amazon and explained the situation and they said they would send me another. Well, they did. Exactly the same. It had an 8"" roller instead of the two wheels as advertised. I returned that one too. Amazon did retun my money. I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS TRANSACTON."
5,The Guide to Happiness,"Although somewhat academic in style, this book is important for those wishing to explore the keys to being in the state of happiness. The author describes happiness in terms of four levels, with Level 3/4 being the ultimate goal. Along the way, he explains the difference between extrinsic and intrinsic rights and how the issues of abortion and euthanasia fit in.An important book to read for those in the pro-life movement or on the fence, or those wishing to explore the philosophy of happiness further."
1,"Is the author happy, or healthy for that matter?","What on earth is this guy talking about? Pop in a human being, let him roll through the Hegelian system of abstract cogs and wheels and out pops Mr. Happy. This guy's ramblings rival the opium dreams of William Burrough's ""Naked Lunch"". In fact, he must have smoked something stronger. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Love this bundle!,Works great! I have no problems at all. Set up was easy. I am not tied to my desk anymore! I love it. Well worth every penny!
1,Plantronics CS50/HL10 BUNDLE,"I had ordered the Plantronics CS50/HL10 BUNDLE ( 66664-01 ) from the seller and it was advertised as used but in good condition. When it arrived the ear piece was damaged, there were faded/worn/missing sticky pieces/substance on the product. If it was advertised as it's actual condition I could have opted not to buy it."
3,Plantronics CS50 review,"Not that comfortable. Seems prone to interference. When it works, works well. The HL10 ""lifter"" is nice."
5,This unit works,"Just be sure that you know what kind of umit this is. There is a lifter that attaches to the phone that actually lifts the headset to get a dial tone. The type of phone you have can make a difference. That said, the unit performs well."
2,SPRI 45cm Fitness ball,"This product is too fragile. I am pretty light person and once I was seated on it, I almost hit the floor. I just returned it to Amazon and bought an anti-burst Everlast. I am pretty happy with it!"
5,THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!!!,"Windlord is a great book. It is an andventure/fantasy book. It tells the tale of how Falon quest to find his uncle to teach him to be a Windlord. He then goes to free his parents and defeat Balor, the evil magician. This is the best of the DeDannan Isle tales. This is one of my favorite books."
5,An Irish myth classic.,"I can't quite tell you how much I love this book! Simply, this is the book that started me reading, I read it first when I was around ten and I'm now 18! Brilliantly told, engaging characters and a gripping story. The only minus perhaps is the fact it's over so fast! Look out for the other sequels Earthlord,Firelord and (Sealord)??."
5,You must have Vol 1 and 2 in your collection.,This is salsa. These albums are a classic collection from Fania. An excellent choice for introducing salsa to someone or adding to a collection. Everyone who loves salsa should have these.
5,What a Releaf!,"Being a new mother, this book has been a big help! My husband and I have found Ms. Lansky's advice to be very sensible as well as benificial to both us and our daughter. This book was recommed to me by a friend. and I would pass this information on to anyone I know with children."
1,Complete waste of money,"What a waste - this camera is absurdly small, bad quality, and the shipping was unreasonably high."
5,Higher Level of Thinking!,This book inspired me in more ways than I can describe. Hillman Curtis is a genius and I cannot wait for him to write another book! Thanks Hillman!
2,It's not as good as I expected.,"I was quite disappointed after reading this book, the Process part at the very beginning was pretty good but when it comes to Inspiration and Practice, I felt that it was just a waste of money and time. I thought Hillman can do better that that?"
3,"Ok, I guess","Had to get this for schoolHas some good parts in it. But overall it was only so-so. I had a single lecture from my professor and it was WAY better then this entire book, but I guess it's all relative. Perhaps when I get further into the New-Media world I will appreciate this more. I don't think I would have gotten this if I did not have to, but I like it enough to keep it around."
1,All Style and No Substance,"I bought this book with the hope that I would learn something beyond the basics. Instead I had the pleasure of going through 11 pages of color charts, basic XML, how to find inspiration, and hardly anything to do with Flash itself. Isn't that what this guy is noted for? He's still siting the same Web sites as he did in Flash Design V4. Wasn't that book published a couple of years a go? Where's the Flash? The book is beautifully designed, but this is simply not enough to give it a higher mark. By the way, the design wasn't even done by Hillman Curtis. It was designed by Rooster. Good thing Hillman is using MTIV for all of his projects. Save your money."
4,This band is a lot of fun!,"My roommate brought home this CD and we had a blast dancing around and listening. The band's influences include Dave Matthews Band, Barenaked Ladies, Phish and more. As I said before and will say again...this band is a lot of fun! I hope you enjoy it!"
2,His story of the Civil War.,"This is an encyclopedia of questionable ""facts"" regarding the military prisons of the era. The author may very well have used sources from the period but as a Vietnam vet, I know that ""war stories"" must be taken with a grain of salt."
5,Substantial Pillow - Great Quality,Great value compared to the department stores (watch this item though - the price tends to fluctuate so buy it on a dip!). The only down pillow I have ever used where I don't need to fold it in half or sleep with a second pillow. Very full and fluffy and nice high thread count cover. Was able to use the pillows right away (the pillows didn't need the usual airing out often required with new down). I love these pillows and would recommend them to everyone!
5,Cloud,"This pillow is truly the best. It's like sleeping on a cloud. I gave it 5 stars because that's exactly what it is. I know it's a little pricey, but well worth it."
5,Great book!,This book does not give new schemes or gimmicks. It reminds you growing a church comes for staying with the vision God has given and following his word.
5,When God Builds A Church,"If you liked the Purpose Driven Church by Rick Warren, you're going to love WHEN GOD BUILDS A CHURCH by Bob Russell. This is destined to be a classic and a ""must-have"" book for every pastor and church leader in America. After you've read the book you'll want to visit the Southeast Church in Louisville. But, be prepared...you'll never be the same again."
4,Good Even If You Don't Like Mega-Churches,"This book, ""When God Builds a Church,"" contains biblical principles and real-life examples for building a strong, evangelistic church. Although I am opposed to the mega-church model and much of the church growth movement for doctrinal reasons, I recommend this book because the general principles it advocates are sound and can be adapted for use in congregations anywhere, without necessarily embracing the big church idea. As a missionary in Brazil, South America I found this work to be encouraging, and hope to implement many of its ideas in a new church work here."
1,Fraternity REcords 50th Anniversary,"I would have given this disc, a minus rating but there isn't one. Because there wasn't any track listing I took a chance anyway. Because the song I was looking for was released by this label. So if your looking for a cd version of the ""Two Of Clubs"" only hit ""Walk Tall""it's NOT HERE !!!!So don't bother, most of these cuts are pre-sixties, most I had never heard before."
4,Almost Perfect....,"The video and sound playback on this unit is pretty awesome. The only thing that kind of sucks about it is the short battery life. I was only able to get about 2 hours of movie time per full battery charge. My solution to the short battery life was to pick up a batterygeek dvd battery which gave me an additional 7 hours of movie time per charge. In short, if I could go back in time I still would have bought the AMW-M520 however I just would have picked up that extended battery pack sooner."
1,Would not recommend - no warranty,"I just purchased this item and even though Amazons website says there is a warranty, I just got off the phone with amazon customer service and they confirm these are refurbrished units and were going to update the website to indicate that there is in fact no warranty provided."
3,Not a good investment!,"It would have been a great buy. I bought back in May of '06. I used it on a trip to Jamaica, and for movies in bed. Unfortunately, all of a sudden, the screen has gone completely black and you can't watch anything anymore. The features didn't work well, the menu button never worked. I was happy but after occasional use, it is already not usable after only 8 months of owning. I wouldn't recommend for anything other than the big screen. Very disappointing, not a good investment."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this player with the impression that it is an all region DVD player. Turns out that this isn't one. The remote sucks, doesn't work well with it, if at all. The only BIG positive is the screen size. Can't find one as big as this one at this price."
3,Ok Product,Not the greatest in terms of build quality but it does work and at this price point it is acceptable.
3,Portable DVD,"This product is ok , but don't take it on a long trip, the movie you will see wont last, ( half the movie will be seen)."
3,"a hassle, but good in the end","Bought this watch as a gift for a very good friend of mine. He absolutely loved it, but needed to take it to a jeweler for repair, as it didn't work. The jeweler told him it was a fake and he couldn't fix it. HOWEVER, amazon picked up the item and delivered a new one upon my friend's request. It wasn't a super fast transaction, but it was fairly simple and my friend is now pleased with the watch he has."
3,it's ok,my son LOVES team umizoomi...but doesn't like the umigames in the beginning. he would rather have more episodes of team umizoomi to watch.
1,Don't waste your time,"I have yet to find a fishing game for Playstation that delivers, and this game was no different. Overall, there are several flaws with this game. The major one being that you only use one button the entire game. Push THE button to cast (you cannot vary the length of a cast), push THE button to reel in the lure, push and hold THE button to land the fish. There is the option of choosing a free fishing mode or tournament style. The tournament is the absolute worst part of the game. Each round lasts 3 lousy minutes....and you cannot increase the time. The only thing that Take2 has done an even remotely good job of is the graphics of the fish...but the novelty of that wares off mighty quickly."
3,Very good Christmas gift!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I gave this game to my teenage cousin and he loved it. So all I can write is what he said: Totally awesome!!!!! Its phat!!!
1,Absolute BS,"This is an art book, with interesting pictures of wrestleing from the past fifty years, male and female. Which would be great, if that's what they were selling. They're not. That's why the book is bound in plastic in most stores, unlike other Taschen coffee book titles like Eric Stanton, which you can readily page through in any normal bookstore that carries it."
5,Excellent!,"Lets be short and to the point, this girl doesn't know how to put out crap, this is another beautiful album. Get it now."
4,Viva Laura!,"Laura won the in the new artist category at the Festival of San Remo in 1993, at the age of 18.We hadn't seen a new album in two years, I was beginning to get worried. Laura is very popular in South America but she just doesn't seem to have taken off in the U.S. I think she will be doing an English album next. In the meantime, check out her fan website, it's one of the better ones out there. This Spanish version of this CD is very good, although I prefer the Italian. My favorite? ""Un error de los grandes""--the sentiment rings true."
2,Don't buy this!,I bought this scanner 2 years ago and it's worked okay. Several times I ran into some gliches and it didn't scan well when hooked through my priner.We just recently bought a new computer which came with Windows XP and this scanner is not compatable with that program. I might as well throw it away! Anyone want mine for free??? LOL!
3,Not for slow glass.,"I couldn't wait to get this thinking I would save some dough by not having to purchase a high dollar telephoto lens. It is quality built and it does work BUT... It does not work well on my Nikon 55-200 f/4-5.6 (kit lens). It ""hunts"" for focus constantly and never finds it. After reading the enclosed pamphlet, it states that this item is not designed for use on DSLR's. I never saw that in any product descriptions. It will work with manual focus but so far I have not been impressed with the picture quality. I'm glad I didn't pay full price. I will hold on to it until I can try it on a faster lens. Hopefully, I didn't just throw away my money."
5,Not a pro,"Bought this to have the extra mm's. It takes a lot of light and little to no movement.With that said, it works very nice. I put it on a 300mm lens. When I go to 300 I usea tripod. You have to manual focus at around 200mm. I'm ok with that, it's what I'm usedtoo. It will also take a lot of light(of course).If you think you are going to get actionat a distance think again. If you want static or very slow moving objects in good lightit does a nice job. Price a 500mm lens and you might think the same. I'm not a pro, just likereally nice pictures."
4,camerabug,Product works properly with my Nikon D300s camera and Nikon 18-200 lens. Also worked with the Tamron 200-500 lens for Nikon. No warranty information from Tamron came with this product. Unlike my Tamron lens it didn't have official Tamron USA logo either. I suspect this is not authorized USA product and probably doesn't have valid warranty. Otherwise no complaint. Delivery was prompt.
3,review,another decent video fro next level fly fishing. I like it more for the flies than the techniques. I still recommend to others.
4,Hilarious!,"Seriously, if you really listen to this CD, it's absolutely one of the funniest comedy albums around. Some of my favorites include: ""Aliens?...nah, what is that"", ""I need some help over here"", and many others. I would give it 5 stars, but as someone else mentioned it is simply one loooooonng track, not several. However chopping up people for food would be a favorite track. It's nice to see that he's not just indiscriminately chopping people up, but as a source of sustenance. However, flushing unused parts is not environmentally friendly, and may lead to some serious plumbing problems in the future. Again, really listen to this CD, and you'll get a good laugh."
3,Alive... sort of,"I recieved the plant in a cardboard box with packing peanuts. When I pulled the plant out it had very pale green wilted leaves with brown spots. I'm pretty good at bringing plants back to life, and horseradish is pretty hardy, so we'll see, but it definitely did not arrive as pictured."
3,looking for root!,didnt arrive as pictured. arrived seemingly gone! but apparently there was a root in the soil that sprouted after a few days! looking forward to a plush plant and root! i lovehorseradish!
1,Boring,I bought this CD due to the fact that I love the HedKandi label and the review I saw on this site. I now realise how seriously I was duped. This really is an awful and dry and boring compiliation. Most of the best tracks are already found on other exceptional Hedkhandi albums. Such as Deeper and Beach House 2&3. As well the Nude Dimension compilation 3Unless you like hard driving trance I suggest that you give this compilation a wide berth. Save your money and get the above CD not only will you get the choice cuts that are included on Ibiza Base but you will also find some other delightful tracks.
3,"Good varierty, but not the best Hed Kandi compilation","This complilation has some good tunes, but many of them have been over marketed on other compilations, including other Hed Kandi productions. I don't know if it's just my copy, but some of the songs sound like they were recorded from vinyl, and have scratches and jumps in the middle of songs. If this were a mix, that might be ok, but I think there are many other Hed Kandi cd's out there that would be more worth your money. I would try the first Es Vive compilation."
5,Packed!,"A good thing about Jack Dangers is that he is not out to rip people off. For real. The songs in this 2 cd set are no exception. The songs are full of synth work, signature pounding drums, and elements of musique concrete. Fans of Dangers will recognize traces of earlier efforts in this album, but will be unable to deny that there is something new, too-- an almost indie element of raw and distorted sounds, perfectly capturing the agression, assertion and frustration of being into the meat of the beat. The second disc contains examples of ambience as hilarious as it is proficient-- as restless and unable to sit still as it would seem that Dangers himself is."
5,Another Genre-Defying Masterpiece from the Godfather,"Jack Dangers has pioneered so many electronic musical genres over the past 2 decades, it's almost impossible to listen to dance music without hearing his touch these days. Whether it's the alternative hip hop scene he forged in the late 80's, the 'big beat' sound he became associated with in the early 90's, the first footsteps into jungle he took, or the more dub-inspired route his work has gone since, anything this man touches is worth a listen. Although most of his work is instrumental these days, his biting raps & Lennon-like vocals on social, environmental, and humane issues fused some of the most intelligent lyrics with a surrealist view that stands apart. If you've never heard of Jack or Meat Beat Manifesto, do yourself a favor and buy everything you can find by him!"
3,Not what I expected,"I thought these were a little pricey but was willing to pay it for the convenience. However, these parchment rounds are very thin, not quality I would have expected. Additionally, when the description says fits 8 or 9 inch, it really is only 8 inch. Wouldn't order again; too much money for the quality."
2,extreme ops / flight of the intruder double feature dvd,"i only got it for flight of the intruder. wich was a good thing. intruder was a great movie. but extreme ops was really bad. weak plot, even weaker story. the only redeaming quality would have been the breif nudity. if it wasn't a dudes skinny ass. at least it was cheap"
2,"Ok, what are the other guys here smoking?","I felt compelled to write a quick review after reading 3 5-star reviews. This album does not deserve 5 stars, it's by far the worst effort from PotUSA, and this coming from someone who owns every album, has seen them live 3 times, and pretty much grew up on them as my favorite band for at least 8 years. This album might be worth owning if you want to claim you have every Presidents album, as it's relatively unknown, but there was only 1 track that actually stood out for me: the last one, which I've seen used on MTV during a skating show. A few others might make you smile, but mostly this album shows how uninspired the Presidents were during this time period. Thank god they came out with Love Everybody, which isn't exactly an incredible album (the entire middle of the album is instantly forgettable, but with songs like Monkey River and Jennifer's Jacket it saves itself). 5 stars? Bah. I'm being generous when I give it 2."
4,cool,"glad they are back. If you like these guys, you gotta check out jason Trachtenburg's REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE produced by chris. It's great!"
4,there back,Freaked out and small is PUSA's best record to date. Any old fans of the band should buy this record. They haven't lost a step in there three year abscence
4,A Welcome return to the office...,"Very glad these guys are back. This is easily their best outing since the first album. Truly inspired stuff, as quirky as ever, genuinely funny in places.Favorite songs: Tiny Explosions, Tiger Bomb, Last Girl On Earth, Jazz guy, Meanwhile Back in the City, Jupiter, Death Star. That's almost all of them, I know. Just buy the album."
5,Awesome! The best of the best!,"This is one of six books the author edited of recipes that won blue ribbons at state/county fairs - and each is absolutely awesome. Every recipe is clearly written, shows the name and location of the contributor and the fair(s) at which it won a blue ribbon, and is preceded by a brief description of why it is so special, where it originated (e.g., long time family favorite), etc. Everything I've tried has been sensational, and there are many more that I can't wait to try. Don't miss this one!"
5,B-52 Photo Essay - inside and out,"There are a lot of books about the B-52, and why not, since it was first flown in 1952. This book was published in 1996 and covers all of the versions of the B-52 up to the H-varient, which is still in current service. Most books give you a lot of narrative and a few photos, this is the other way around.2/3 of the photos are in color showing the interior and exterior of this giant bomber. There are also 3 pages of color plates showing camouflage patterns and line drawings to help the reader see the crew positions, landing gear and other interesting tidbits.The target audience are modelers, but anyone who is interested in really seeing this plane without actually being in/on/around it will be pleased. I was, am glad I have added it to my collection."
2,incomplete,"if you are a doctor with a PHD, you will love this...if not,try and figure out what all these parts are without a chart, because there is none and none available from seller."
3,Loved it... yet dissapointed,"I really like this locket as far as quality and it's unique design. However there is one big flaw. On the actual place for the pictures there is not a lip to slip the pictures under. You would have to just glue them on and there's nothing to secure or hide the edges of the picture, which in my oponion would look tacky. So, unfortunately I'm gonna have to return it."
3,"A small, abridged, collection.","I was disappointed to find this only a very small collection of some of the 12,000 hymns written by either John, or Charles Wesley. The publisher readily admits inside the front cover, that they picked only some of the ones they thought would be accepted in the church. They also admit to changing archaic words in order to ""make it more accessible"". This, coupled with the lack of some of the verses to well known hymns by the Wesleys, such as the 3rd verse to ""And, Can it Be?"", make me wonder just how accurate the others are.Still, it is a small collection for those interested in hearing a small portion of some of the lesser known hymns by the incredibly linguistically talented Wesleys."
4,Fun Album,I got to know of this band while living in Europe for a while. This is a fun album and I enjoy popping it into the CD player now and then.
3,Not a Verse Translation,"Don't get me wrong, the translation is fine, but if you're looking for a verse translation of the Eclogues, the Georgics, or the Aeneid, look elsewhere. Unfortunately, I had to purchase the item without knowing whether it was verse or prose, since none of the reviews indicates that it is, in fact, prose. I suppose I can't have too much Virgil, but it's nice to know ahead of time, right? Well, now all the other people in the world looking for a verse translation of Virgil's works (all twenty of them, right?) will know that this isn't what they want."
5,2007 Tahoe Mats,I am very pleased with my Premium Rear Cargo Floor Mat. The color matched the interior of the grey carpet in my truck and the quality of the mat appears to be extremely durable. The fit is taylored to fit my Tahoe and exactly what I wanted. Amazon prices were so good that I purchased the other Floor Mats for the ront and back seat.fhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IZOCLU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
1,Just Awful!,"I am not a fussy person and will eat just about anything, but these ""Just a cheese snak"" was really bad! I can't even begin to describe the taste. I acutally threw the whole order away. Take my word, keep away.Just The Cheese Snack Chips Pizza -- 2 ozJust The Cheese Snack Chips Pizza -- 2 oz"
4,Electric Jug?,These guys have a very unique sound which probably comes from their main lyricist insisting on writing and usually performing while tripping on LSD. This is the same guy you plays an 'electric jug' which is apparently just a jug with a microphone attached to it. This gives them one of the most unique sounds ever and actually complements most of the tunes instead of driving you crazy like you would think. If it hadn't been for the happy accident of like the film 'High Fidelity' I wouldn't have known who this band was when I read about them in the book 'The Best Music You've Never Heard'. I bought this album on the strength of those two things and have been happy with it. 'Scarlet and Gold' is my favorite song on the album with a great bass line.
4,Something else,"I like real-time strategy, but I actually wanted the board game too. If you wanted the board game, try under board games. If you like real time strategy, this one is good, pick it up."
3,Axis & Allies,"Its a little more difficult than I thought but my son thats 14 has no problem playing this game,but I guess it comes with the times I'm 47..haha"
5,golf balls,"I really enjoy my new golf balls and for the price, you can't beat them. I live in Africa and these balls are really expensive here, so I am really happy."
3,Titleist rewashed balls,I purchasaed thirty Titleist Pro V1 AAA Recycled golf balls. About twenty were clean unmarked balls.Ten had logos and other marks on them. These are good practice balls.
4,Great Balls,The balls look very good and the only reason I did not give them 5 stars was because I have not had the chance to play with more than a few so far. They all look relatively new but some have definitely been played more than just once or twice. Definitely a great deal and I would recommend the company and their balls to anyone.
3,These are okay,"These balls are pretty much what they say they are. They look like balls that I would pick up on the course and play. They are in reasonable condition. The only disappointing thing to me is the age of some of these balls. Based on the markings, it appears that half the balls I received are more than 5 years old, and some of the them appear to be closer to 10 years old. I was not expecting all of them to be 1 or 2 years old, but 10 years seems a bit much..."
1,"Bad, very bad","those ball are far away from very good, even from good, those balls are very very used and old, I received a lot of ball branded, and in very bad conditions, and the worse, I recieved practice's ball."
5,good value for money,"These Titleist balls are those that are lost on the courses but then salvaged by the greens keepers or others. They are cleaned up and then packaged. Overall I am quite pleased with them. Since they are from different sleeves, you might need to mark your balls before you use them in a group. I would recommend the use of these balls."
2,wouldn't order again,"The quality of the balls in this package were not AAA in my opinion, more like ""B"". Several of the balls had scuff marks from trees and/or cart paths. Also, the overall look of the golf balls were very gray or dingy. Makes me think they were in the water a long time. I wouldn't order them again."
3,Mostly good balls but included 4 Practice balls,"Most of the balls are in good shape, 4 are practice balls so not worth much. About 70% of the balls have logos on them but overall decent quality balls for the price."
2,Not what I expected,"quality was not what I expected, some of the balls were shag ball quality. 2 of the balls had small holes in the covers and several had cart path rash. There were maybe 5 balls that met my expectations. Buy some new mid price balls you'll be happier."
3,AA not AAA,"Overall I was happy with the quality of golf ball, however, some of the balls were marked up enough to bring the rating to AA."
3,its just good enough for the price...,Friends of similar playing habits and handicap...a little disappointed as these balls dont last more than one round...high expectation or being a little greedy...
3,Get what you play for ..,"The balls were Pro-V's but were inconsistent. A few were out of round, covers appeared water retrieved but most of the balls were perfectly fine recycled balls. I've played with Pro-V x-outs and now these... I would buy e x-outs after playing & comparing with the recycled balls. Consistency is important."
3,get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for.. Most all have scuff marks or some amount of paint missing, so for the total cost being so cheap, the quality is justified."
5,Best cd I've heard in a long time,"This is one of the best cds out right now, better than nelly was when he started out. Every song is tight, Pretty Willy is making his way up to the top, he's bound to be the next Nelly or even better. Pick this cd up now! Hes got some cool ... beats to his songs and he gets his point across with little/no cussing."
3,Tha Lou Has Another Hot One!!!,"Once again the Lou (St. Louis) has raised a star. Pretty Willie is HOT. He has some slammin' tracks on his cd. I personally enjoy Roll Wit Me, Lil Piggy, and You Suella. These are some very good songs. Pretty Willie has a great style. He kind of mixes R&B wit hip hop to make his songs sound good. If u like to lay back and listen to good music, then this is the CD to buy."
3,Good,"the first 5 songs on cd 1 is worth the price. Rediculously good. CD 2 starts of good as well. but both cds are like you are driving along a really nice stretch of highway by a cliff, and all of a sudden you drive off the cliff. I dont get what oakey was doing half way through both cds but they just abrupty fall off and cease to impress or keep my attention after. I would buy the damn thing just for solar stone's day by day, thats the standout track in my mind, a standout track in my whole record collection at that. but that is just my opinion"
4,Refreshing,J'ai fais l'achat de plusieur C.D. Mais je reviens constamment sur celui-ci. Il a une touche sur cette album que je ne retrouve pas sur d'autre et ces tres malheureux.
3,CHECK THE IMPORT VERSION,"This CD is very good. However, the original UK edition is much deeper and trancier"
4,A really great CD but...,"A really great CD but I must say that the first 2 tracks on disc two just really don't appeal to me. Although, the last two tracks on disc two (especially Deeper Love) are beautiful. There usually has to be a track or two on an Oakenfold mix that I just cannot get into and to me it is the beginning of disc 2. I really don't get the mixing complaints from other reviewers but I have about a dozen dance, techno, CDs and may not have experienced great mixing yet."
1,global underground:new york-paul oakenfold,"i'm a big oak's fans since year 97', i've bought this complation set without checking any reviews about it, i've followed my instincets about him and i'was very dissappointed later after listining to the set of cd's,the tarcks on cd1 & cd2 were mixed in a bad sequence plus the mix more like amatures or beginners in this set, but i've to give him credit in prefecto travilling complation, the oppossiet good sepuence and flawless mix."
3,HELLO,"I PERSONALLY LIKE THIS ONE, BUT IF YOUR INTO MAINSTREAM DANCE ECT. THEN THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. SOME OF THE SONGS KIND OF LACK SOMETHING BUT OVERALL THIS IS A GREAT CD THAT REALLY GEATS YOU MOVING. I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE FIRST SONG ON THE CECOND CD."
1,Pual can do better,"I have this CD and the beat is too monotonic. I honestly think Pual can do much better I just feel that this isn't his best work if you want to hear Oakie the listen to tranceport or save your money, and get something by the Ministry of Sound they never fail to disapoint."
2,"Good songs, terrible mixing","Paul Oakenfold spins these songs in the most pedestrian, predictable way imaginable. The songs themselves are good, but the mixing is...is...well, its not really there, is it? Case in Point: disc two, where he just throws songs together in a pastich way without any real transition. From Drum and Bass, then, the intricate trance of ""Leaving Planet Earth"" to ""Air""--which has been mixed elsewhere, to glorious effect (IE: Ian Ossia's Renaissance vol. One [import] from last year). Here it is just thrown in. It doesn't seem like a lot of thought or care was really put into this mix--it's just the greatest hits. Whereas REAL DJ's like Sasha and Digweed or Dave Seamen or Nigel Dawson construct tight, intricate epics, Oakenfold just churns out product, like Tranceport, which is good for the first five or six songs.Maybe it is worth paying for in vinyl, so you can mix the songs yourself. He does, after all, offer full, undoctored mixes."
4,"Consistent, good music choices","I think Paul Oakenfold is a little overrated, but I still enjoy buying all his cd's. This one is probably one of the better ones of late--maybe a little better than the new and popular ""Tranceport"". If you can't buy both ""Tranceport"" AND this, buy this one first."
3,Good but there are better,"I would reccommend A perfecto record, over a underground, but if you like the underground series better, then this is probably the one to get.I like Another World, Flouro"
3,good lounging ammo,"This is solid. There are many good loungy and slower beats very appropriate for upscale bars or whatever, but it is a little lacking in anything organic. There's a couple symphonic rythms here and there, but overall, and I know I'm going to incite people with this, it does not really do anything fantastic or inspire greatness. A little too digitized or ""casio"" for some people, I wouldn't really recommend this for those on the fence of the techno-dance-electronica genre."
4,Interesting Retrospective,"Legacy Okenfold, deeper house but less dramatic carry through. Still a good trip, however, and well worth the coin.This isn't Resident or Tranceport, just a different side of Oakenfold. And a very good side at that. I thought Fluoro was wacked. Travelling has its moments. GU7 pre dates Resident, and is just deeper and slower.Oakie has different shades for everyone... so forget the pseudo trance 'experts' - there is no such thing - and pick this up if you liked the all popular Tranceport. GU7 is no Britney Spears."
5,Trance at its best,"Paul's Global Underground clearly surpasses any other of the series. His trancy, yet altogether thoroughly enthralling music leads listeners into the new sound of music while making them dance till exhaustion in the process. Those who have seen Paul perform can say with satisfaction that this album is an exact reflection of his capabilities and talent."
3,mellow trance,"this cd is everything that a clubber wants to hear after a fun night in the club...great for the long ride home. the beats are relatively slow and the songs are very melodic. this is not, however, the floor burning trance that oakey plays in person. if you don't have it, get it. if you do have it...listen to it next time you leave the club. and don't skip around between songs. be patient and enjoy."
5,So smoooth ..you will be in deep space at no time,One of the best mix DJ'S ive heard in awhile. the CD generates an atmosphere with deep trance and capitivates your soul into infinite bliss. This CD is hynoptic and is brilliant.
5,Hits you like a gunshot wound to the head,The one line summary is a sample line from song one on disc 2. and it is the absolute truth. Oakenfold is the man the myth the DJ with the power and skill to keep the bodies rockin all night long. His skill are amazing this Cd will never let you down when you need to feel the groove to dance all night weather in a club or your car the music is powerful entrancing and just amazing
4,GU NY Oaky,"Ok, ok hes not the greatest mixer on this cd but who cares? The track selection is just amazing and CD 1 and 2 will blow you away. I reccomend this to anyone who likes the old Oaky, not the washed up mainstream dj he is today."
2,Not as good as Tranceport and Resident at Cream,"I am a big Paul Oakenfold fan, but this album was a total disappointment. I love the progressive house/trance he spins, but this record does not contain that. If you see him live, he does not play this type of stuff. If you want to hear real Oakenfold, by Tranceport or Resident at Cream."
3,a different perspective,"this is an interesting look at immigration and immigration policy in the United States. rather than accuse or scare people with facts that aren't always true, Borjas chooses to present straight facts that relate to employment, educational, and economic data. it makes you look at what is going on in our country from a different perspective. the chapters do tend to get redundant after a while though."
2,a source for anti-immigrant and frequently false information,"Mr. Borjas is well known for several things:1. His relationship with the Center for Immigration Studies, an admittedly right wing policy institute whose goal is to markedly decrease immigration and support the Republican Party. This organization consistently sends to the media negative sound bites, which are unsubstantiated, clearly biased, and in many cases false.2. Fabrication of unproven doctrine, such as migrant labor decreases both the income and jobs of poor Americans. He has stated that this was conjecture when he originally wrote this and uses this in many of his subsequent writings without objectively proving this.With this background, it is very difficult to accept any ""objective"" statements from this ""scholar."""
3,Running out of steam already,"The first volume, consisting of the content of issues no. 1 and 2 of the comic book series based on the fictional comic book characters from Chabon's novel, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, was much more successful than this second installment, taken from nos. 3 and 4. Maybe the ""try harder"" rule about sequels applies here, too, but the quality of both art and plotting is much lower and the tongue-in-cheek fictional comics history that made the first volume such fun is almost nonexistent in this one. Give it up, guys."
2,Great fit but poor sound quality,"I bought these to go jogging with a minidisc player. The fit is terrific: they stayed on my head with no trouble during a two-hour run, and my ears felt no chafing, pinching or any other discomfort at any time. Unfortunately, the sound quality is poor. Unlike the full sound of the headphones that came with my minidisc player, these headphones have a tinny, trebly sound that makes a number of instruments sound shrill (including saxophone, trumpets, and strings) and can make a rich, gutsy voice sound throaty. It's sort of like listening to AM radio. The sound quality is not awful, but it's not good enough for me. I wish I had spent a little more for better sound."
4,comfort AND quality,I am using these headphones with my CD player when I am at the gym. I wanted some that wouldn't get in the way and would stay in comfortably. I have tried the regular ear buds before but sometimes they would become akward or would shake a little loose after some time on a cardio machine. These earhuggers are soft around the ears and have an adjustable volume on the cord. Great for working out. If they last me for awhile after bring thwon in my gym bag over and over than they deserve the 5 stars!
3,What they were made for.,"I wasn't sure if I should buy these headphones because of the mixed reviews. I did buy them and I had to write a review for them. I have to say that the sound quality is not the best but the reason I purchesed these headphones was because of the size, I needed some headphones that I could carry around in my pocket, bag, ect. and I couldn't take my ""studio"" style ones everywhere so I decided to get these. For the price I think they are an ok buy."
1,Breaks easily,"Only a few days after I bought it, one side of the headphone broke down. No sound would come out of it, and when it does, the sound would crackle every now and then that I just had to take it off.It's happened to me twice with this product. At first, I thought it was just sheer luck that I got the defective product. Unfortunately, I couldn't return it because it was already opened. But when I purchased another one, it happened again.Don't buy these. They're low quality and will break down easily. Save your money and buy a better quality headphone."
2,Bad Sound,I bought these headphones and while they fit reasonably comfortably the sound is awful. The mid range is way too high while the bass and treble (especially the bass) are cut out. I'd avoid buying them unless you use them for listening to spoken word of some kind.
2,Giving false info.,"If you look at the Tech. Data on the AV-2000, it says it puts out 33mm, but that would be false since some of the best headphones out there put out that much, and I mean studio stuff. So I looked up these headphones on another site, and found out that they are only 13mm, and a ... cheaper. I can't tell you where, but you might want to look before you shop. This does not make these bad headphones though. I might just buy them."
1,Grey spirituality for diehard liberals stuck in the 60s,"What does reading these essays do for me and for other readers in their twenties? Like Sr. Joan, these writers point the way to the past, not the future. All right, the 60's happened. Get over it. Puh-leaze. Meanwhile, the rest of us have to figure out how to live the faith here and now, stuck in the middle of this scandal-ridden Weak-Land called ""american cathoicism"" They may aspire to be a Catholic mod-squad, but they come off more like the Flintstones. Perhaps they should have all gotten themselves ordained by the Peace Corps."
5,An Excellent and affordable product,"Well,this thing is cool, I can save mp3 and hear them later, that is the principal use for it."
4,Have You Been to Jail for Justice? CD,"I didn't know about this song, but when I got arrested for demonstrating on behalf of voting representation in Congress for US citizens who live in Washington, DC, the so-called capital of the free world, where we pay federal taxes but have no vote on how that money is spent, a friend told me about the song. It's a great song."
3,BOOTS !,"Bought this CD for one song, Megadeth's cover of ""These Boots are made for Walking."" A blistering version that never made it on Megadeth's own rarity & B -sides CD."
1,This battery is defective,"My old battery lasts about thirty minutes, that is the reason I bought this one.well...this battery only lasts about forty five minutes!!! No big improvemet!I'm very upset about this purchase."
2,Boring and a waste of time,I have always enjoyed Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine books and eagerly looked forward to this one. I couldn't put it down for about 1/2 of the way through and it went steadily downhill from there. I persevered but regretted it when I finished it as the characters were so unlikable and uninteresting as was the premise which was unbelievable. I simply didn't care about anyone in this book.
1,not up to snuff,"Barbara Vine, Ruth Rendell's alternate penname, has produced a lugubrious ""mystery novel"" that is much more ""novel"" than ""mystery,"" and a glacially-paced, uninvolving novel at that. Her characters, unlikable types engaged in bizarre pastimes (climbing across Maida Vale rooftops), will not engage your sympathies.Vine/Rendell invokes old cliches, several more than once, like how in the eyes of 20-year-olds, people of 40 seem ancient. These are commonplace observations, adding to the tedium of this over-long book.Reading ""Grasshopper"" will make you reach for an Agatha Christie classic as a tonic! Christie's deft plotting, well-defined characters, and brisk narrative will brace you up after Vine's lumpen book."
1,Another disappointment,"This latest Barbara Vine novel was such a disappointment; an overlong, insipid story line whose characters were unbelievable caricatures. Had it not been by BV I would have given up well before half way. Following on the equally disappointing Chimney Sweeper's Boy, it's clear that BV has, for the moment, run out of ideas. It's difficult to realise that this is the same author who gave us such wonderful books as A Dark Adapted Eye and Asta's Book - so densely plotted, so full of menace and so unputdownable. Please Barbara/Ruth, wait until you've recaptured your old form before disappointing your fans in this way again."
5,I don't know which book some of the other reviewers read..,"...but the one I read was magnificent. Much like ""The House of Stairs"" and ""A Fatal Inversion"", ""Grasshopper"" deals with the trials and tribulations of a mismatched assortment of roommates whose good intentions lead to disaster. The prose is tight, the characters are fascinating and occasionally infuriating, the criminality is sometimes troublingly ambiguous, and the story is first-rate. My only disappointment? That I finished it so quickly! Stop reading this review this instant and order the book."
2,Not worth the time,"I've generally enjoyed her other works, with their often obsessive and creepy themes, but this one didn't do anything for me at all. A very odd story, with very odd and unpleasant characters. I pushed myself about half-way through, hoping for it to get interesting; instead it just got wierder and wierder. I didn't care how it came out, and quit reading it."
1,A tedious surprise,"I had saved this book to read on a transatlantic flight and looked forward to it, since I have liked all the Barbara Vine novels before--liked them very much (except for Grasshopper). I was surprised to find it tedious and dull, manaaged to get through half of it, and when I came home, threw it away."
2,"Poorly written, dull","This novel is really poorly written, the characters are all unlikeable and boring, and you are strung along throughout the entire clunking thing by promises of ""secrets"" to be revealed, which, once they are revealed, are pretty anticlimactic and serve only to make you dislike the characters even more."
2,Not one of her best,"I am a huge Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine fan who puts immeadiately down whatever else it is I am reading when a new release comes out. I can't say how disappointed I was in this novel; it started out so promising with an introduction to psychologically fragile and scarred characters, as per her usual, but then it seemed to go off in so many different tangents that it was impossible to tie them together, or at least tie them up, at the disappointing end. I would rather reread on older novel (One Across, Two Down;No More Dying Then; A Dark Adapted Eye are some favorites) the read newer novels like this. I enjoyed The Keys to the Street and hope that her next novels are up to par with these and that Grasshopper was just an abberation in an illusstrious career."
2,Huge disappointment,I've read almost all of Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine and was greatly disappointed by this. The characters were well developed but the plot plodded along and by the end I wasn't intrigued or even interested in what was going to happen.
2,Could have been shorter,"This is a 400 page book that could have been 300. The reader has to wade through the descriptions to get to the plot. And that hopping back and forth from the past, when they were 19, to the present drives me nuts."
2,I have to admit i was dissapointed,"I think Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine is one of the greatest authors of our times, but I found this book boring,long,and meandering, much as I felt about The Chimney Sweepers Boy. These are the only two in a long, long line of great stories, that I did not care for. Please look for earlier Rendell/Vine books, The Bridesmaid, Going Wrong, The Face Of Trespass, Make Death Love Me, King Solomons Carpet (fabulous), The Killing Doll, A Fatal Inversion, The House of Stairs, the list is endless. One bad apple does not an orchard make, and her orchard is superb."
2,Even the title is bad!,"I am an avid fan of Ruth Rendell/BarbaraVine, so I purchased this new hardcover as soon as it came out, assuming it would be as wonderful as her others. I was certainly disappointed. The book didn't grab my interest, but I kept picking it up and reading it, hoping it would get better--it didn't. The assortment of misfits that she assembles in this story did not capture my interest or my sympathy. Sure, they have their obsessions and their phobias as many of her characters do, but Ruth Rendell makes them so unlikeable, that I did't care what happened to any of them. The ending seemed hastily put together, with a feeble attempt at tying up all the looe strings. Save your money and borrow the book instead!"
2,Didn't receive tea that I ordered,"Have ordered the strawberry tea bags for over a year, this order I received strawberry sensation tea bags. Don't like the strawberry sensation, wanted just strawberry."
5,The tastiest of the Ahmad flavored teas,"Authentic strawberry scent and flavor, very tasty both hot or iced, the best one in the Ahmad lineup of flavored teas, not because I'm a fan of strawberry fruit but because this tea is mild tasting yet full of flavor (while the other Ahmad varieties have a less authentic flavor and leave a generic bitter taste in the mouth which the strawberry one doesn't)"
3,Very Noisy,"After Installing the new fuser in my HP 4250, the printer became very noisy while printing. Print quality seems fine so far."
2,Should have learned my lesson from The Phantom Menace,"Better than The Phantom Menace though not anywhere near the caliber of the originals. The novels of episodes I, II and III read like above-average fan fiction, and I can barely relate how much I'm saddened that this series is considered cannon. Since reboots are all the rage now, why not toss these three in the garbage compactor and start over?"
4,Made me feel 8 years old again,"Subject matter was intense for my seven year-old niece, but wasa catalyst in getting her to talk about her own insecurities, likehaving to leave a favorite teacher behind, or having close relatives move away. Anyone who has ever had to deal with separation anxiety in young children will find this book an immensely helpful resource. Beautiful illustrations. Schmaltz-free text was perfect for her as she is able to sniff out overt sentimentality a mile away!"
4,a advanced book in a begining look,"yes, I think the guy from Stanford is right. Apostol just wants to put everything in your head and perhaps the only one enjoyed is himself.A begening student should never start with his works, but with the "" first course of calculus"" of the great profesor Serge Lang, that will be a right way.But, however, when one has entered the land, Lang's book is not enough, he should continue with ""anylisis math"", that will be the best way."
3,Couple your Calculus with *ENGLISH*,"I've only browsed Apostol's Calculus and came here to see what others thought about it. Consider this a review of the reviews: these reviewers may or may not understand calculus, but one thing's for damn sure--none of them understand English. May I recommend Strunk and White's Elements of Style to these reviewers?"
2,Calculus Volume 2 (Tom M. Apostol),"This book contains a lot of information, and is rigorous, with many proofs and a vast array of problems. However, it is weak on worked examples and in explaining the concepts clearly. Diagrams are kept to a minimum. I used this book during an undergraduate Calculus course, and found that it did not help me to grasp the fundamentals of the subject. There are much better books available e.g. Stewart, which cover much of the same ground in a much simpler format. In my experience, only the ablest students were able to benefit from Apostol's dense writing style and scarcity of worked examples. Apostol does, however, include sections on matrix algebra and calculus which are not available in many other textbooks. There are also solutions to many of the problems at the end of the text."
4,Informative and interesting!,"Fun little book with abundant photos (mostly quite small though) and interesting detailed text. Detailed, but not overly technical or boring. Too bad there is no deck plan of Imperator/Berengaria!!! Had there been, my rating would be a solid 5 stars! For the price, highly recommended for the passenger ship connosieur."
4,Review for EarHugger EH-510 Middle Ear Headphone,"These headphones are perfect for teen bus rides or long trips where there is limited space for extras. Their sound quality was great for this type of headphone. All-in-all, I gave these phones a four star rating for their sound quality but somewhat uncomforatble earpieces."
2,looking for Sedona,I was looking for specifics on Sedons. The Lonely Planet doesn't share much about the gem of the state.
4,Although I didn't see any drastic weight loss ...,"Although I didn't see any drastic weight loss with the Slim Fast Chocolate Nutritional Meal, I did feel that one shake filled me up as though I'd eaten an entire meal. It had a delicious flavor and not that """"chalky"""" taste that so many diet shakes have. It was very easy to prepare in just a few minutes. I was able to easily prepare these at my office with little or no cleanup. I'd recommend these to my friends and family."
2,"I found the product to have a grainy, ...","I found the product to have a grainy, """"diet-y"""" taste. I found that it tasted best when blended in the blender with ice, milk, and bananas. This seemed to hide the taste. The product alone mixed with milk was not appealing to me. I wouldn't recommend this product to friends or family as a choice in weight management, from a flavor standpoint."
3,disappointment,the video was descent until about half way through. the second half of the video has nothing to do with steelhead fishing the olympic penninsula. i expected the whole video to be about the title.
3,not what was expected,"This product was not what I expected it to be. I was looking for a pouch with some firmness to it, not a hard case, but not a floppy bag either.I guess I mistakenly got the impression that the bag would have more firmness to it. Also, the picture on the product page on Amazon shows logos on the bag and there were no logos whatsoever on the product I received.The product was not suitable for the use I intended it for. I might re-task the bags to be used for a bag for portable headphones, but they did not work out for the use they were intended for."
2,Very thin,Very thin and flimsy...not for expensive glasses at all. Does ok if you aren't too concerned with scratches.
2,Print Shop 12,Graphics okay but the navigation is way too lengthy. It is way too frustrating when error message comes up and erases all that you have typed/arranged. Would not recommend this product after trying to print a sign for the past hour!
1,insane,This is a great product its the best software of its kind. But if they think I'm going to swap 10 Cds when I have a DVD player there are crazy. I have PrintShop 10 on DVD and I love it.
4,Hallelujah!,"Delightful series for Dame Thora Hird. Very different from her character in Last of the Summer Wine, but somehow more of the Thora as she lived life."
4,M820e Does the job for me,My M820e has functioned well for me. I'm running on Wind-NT 4.0.My son uses it on his laptop running Wind-98. I bought mydaughter one for her laptop which is running Wind-2000. Note that you have to download a revised driver for Wind-2000 fromthe HP web page. Not clear why other reviewer didn't downloada driver for his Wind-2000 o/s. HP web page says this isrequired.
1,Poor Product,"I don't know if you can attribute the poor quality to the products prior treatment, or if it is the new driver that needs to be installed to run the thing w/ windows 2000, or if the product just (stinks) but I can tell you one thing....I would not buy it again if someone paid me!!!!!!"
4,Gran album de Serrat,"Editado en 1970 y un gran éxito de ventas en su tiempo, Mi Niñez no alcanza probablemente el nivel superlativo de discos como Mediterráneo o Dedicado a Antonio Machado (al disco le falta un tema súper clásico, como Cantares, Mediterráneo, Tu Nombre me sabe a Yerba o Para la Libertad - la excelente Fiesta es lo mas cercano aqui a un tema clásico de Serrat). De todos modos, es un gran disco, con muchos otros temas muy agradables de escuchar, como Señora, Cuando me Vaya, Muchacha Típica, Como un Gorrión, Si la Muerte pisa mi Huerto y Amigo Mio. Muy recomendable. El sonido, como en otros albumes de esta etapa de Serrat deja algo que desear - seguramente, en España a principios de la década del 70 la tecnología de grabación no estaba a la altura de los países mas avanzados del mundo y eso lamentablemente se nota en el transpaso a CD."
5,among the best spanish music-poetry,"If you dont speak spanish or catalan, dont buy it, or for that case, any of his works. Serrat is the foremost poetic spanish singer, rigth up there with Leonard Cohen. Any one wishing to learn something about Spain, its people and customs, as well as to have a most delightful musical experience, must buy this."
2,Poorly described,"The description of the item was not complete enough to determine if it was the correct fit for my use. As it turned out, it was for a smaller engine and I ended up making my own gaskets."
4,Joel Harper works it,"I have been going to a Y custom cuts class weekly and wanted a home activity. This fits just what I wanted. Mix and match 2 different warm ups with 3 different body focus routines, for as little or much as you can stand. Always 2 or three levels for how strong/experienced you are helps. Background music is a bit lame, but the quality of the instruction overcomes any shortcommings of the music background. Content of the instruction was very good.I received the DVD in a Tyvek envelope and the inside case was cracked. The quality of the DVD recording was just adequate. Spotty and speckley at times, like it had been over-recorded or done on less than stellar equipment. I know that this is not ""Great Performances"", but did expect the quality to be better for a ""new"" disc. It had tape on the edges, but I did wonder if it had been repacked after being viewed.All in all, for about $15, I was satisfied. NN"
2,BORING AND VERY SLOW,This dvd is fine if you're quite elderly or in very poor shape and want to do something. I would not recommend it to anyone not in that category. Joel doesn't even appear to be in great shape.
5,Just what I needed,"Playing in the cold was awful when I had to use a metal mouthpiece, but now I have this one and it's perfect! It's very comfortable to play with and looks great too! Also shipped to me on time! Great buy!"
2,OK,"I teach a dual credit HS Geology class & only show the parts about the volcano blowing up & the ashfall segments, otherwise, thisDVD is disappointing to me bcs it rambles on about how people were trying to leave, etc.There was very little scientific info."
5,NOVA- In the Path of a Killer Volcano,"This video is about a devastating eruption of the Mt. Pinatubo Volcano. It is an outstanding narrative of the events. Pinatubo had not erupted for hundreds and hundreds of years. It is in the Philippines on the island of Luzon.What makes this so fascinating is that for the first time ever in history America had one of the largest Naval Bases there outside of the U.S. And it was right in the path of the eruption. The video shows the scientists trying to obtain data while everyone was fleeing. If a viewer wants technical don't buy this.But anyone that wants excitement, action and seeing an incredible eruption, this video is for you.You will be watching the death of a large U.S. Naval Base that was not attacked by a human enemy.For some the entire event was horrible and scary. Pop a bag of popcorn, get comfey on the couch and enjoy."
5,Finally a voice like mine.,"As I face the eminent journey of my daughter into her own puberty and adolescence, I have read many books which have provoked much thought and worry as well as comfort. I did not realize though until reading Promiscuities how the voices I was listening to; while familier, knowlegable, and full of wisedom; weren't mine.I am 34 years old, close to Naomi's age if I calculate correctly, and for me this book gave words to a confusion I have held in the background of my consciousness ever since my youth. I don't know what the inclusive ""generation gap"" is for true appreciation of this book, but I'm in it!Thanks Naomi!"
5,The Talk of the Town,"It is an excellent conversation piece to share with your husband/boyfriend, friends, daughter and mother. It touches on so many issues that are too ""weird"" to say outloud. It really makes you think about your sexuality and your desires and your relationships with both women and men in a way that validates them for the first time ever. It is thought- provoking and informative. You will read it, love it, and pass it on."
4,Well Worth Your Time,I found this book to be a facinating study into what it meant to grow up female in San Francisco in the 1970's. Having grown up in rural america about the same time as Ms. Erlich I found the accounts of growing up in San Francisco as facinating as I did find growing up female. I found many of the stories both shocking as well as facinating. The phenomological research method imploid by the author clearly presented the material in the humanistic manor it deserved. In short I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like a glimse into this world
1,"Too bad, it was a good idea","If Wolf had wanted to write about her fast, furious and unique upbringing in San Francisco, she should have just called it an autobiography. But to market this book as a glimpse into the life of any American ""woman coming of age""? Garbage. To compare the experiences of a young woman growing up in The Haight and running around in The Mission to young women in anytown, USA is absurd. Most didn't even know what a strip club was until long after they had their first experiences with sexuality. And the stuff about the mothers of her time dancing nude and tripping (hippies in San Francisco)? ""We"" didn't know that mother. The author might as well have been raised on a different planet. The clincher was the story of her experiences as a giddy twelve-year-old in Israel. Israel? Give me a break."
2,sloppy,"Promiscuities is interesting if viewed as a book detailing one woman's coming of age. However, as a more serious feminist view, it is a poor read. Ms. Wolf claims many adolescent anxieties common to both sexes as uniquely female problems and fails to really dig deeper than the superficial. Her treatment of anecdote as ""evidence"" is irresponsible and to agree with her conclusions requires a strained point of view. With vague and imprecise writing, this is a sloppy effort. Ms. Wolf can and has done much better and most readers would be better off passing up this title."
4,Thought provoking and worthwhile,"Promiscuities may not resonate with everyone, but as a member of Wolf's generation, it definitely did with me. She does a wonderful job of explaining the whole 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation in which girls live regarding sexuality, with anecdotes from her and others' personal experiences.I fail to see why the book has gotten so much criticism for being anecdotal and personal; at no point did I feel she was trying to pass it off as hard science. I think Wolf explains beautifully the whole paradox of what it means to be female in post sexual revolution society. I would not only recommend this book to young women, but to parents, particularly fathers of girls about to enter this stage, because I think it will be a real eye opener."
4,Saved by PROMISCUITIES,"Naomi Wolf, called ""naive"" and ""sloppy"" by middle aged reviewers, speaks to a younger audience in a voice that is frank and concise.I first read Promiscuities at the age of 15 while in the south of France on my first ""summer program"" experience...bought the book as something to read on the plane but wound up completely engrossed over and over again. I was away from home for an extended period of time for the first time in my life...confronted with sexuality from all angles. Wolfe's words, her stories and anecdotes, made SENSE of the ""rites of passage"" I was unconsciously experiencing.Heartfelt thanks to the author, a woman who is not afraid to ""tell it like it is"" and who offers sincere advice to young women in the world today."
3,Definitely dare not speak for all of us.,"Puh-leese!!! I still can't believe that anybody of my generation seriously liked ""Tonight's the Night"" as anything other than a bit of satire. I think Rod Stewart is so cheesy that he is bound to become the Wayne Newton of our generation. Young girls wanting a boyish older man!!! That ought to make pedophiles happy!!! Certainly not my case!!! That's for starters. It's always interesting to read anybody's memoirs, but for a book supposedly about desire, it talked a lot about events which transpired, but very little about feelings, either emotional or physical, nor much about hopes and dreams, and how they were formed by such events. I probably had a more sheltered or restricted adolescent life (or did I?) but my emotional life was much richer. Also, there was too much talk about what was ""learned"" from said events, without much questioning of those lessons. What's the matter, in your adolescent years, were you so docile that you never got angry?"
1,This book is a waste of your time!,"Now, I consider myself a feminist and a young, progressive woman. But I found Wolf's Promiscuities to be the dumbest book I have ever read. It is boring, first of all, and it is shallow, and why would anyone waste their time even writing a book like this? I can hardly get her point in writing this. If Naomi Wolf is what our generations' feminists are like, heaven help us! I felt very disillusioned reading this book. It was basically a glorification of promiscuity. That is not a feminist stance, it's a great ""hurray!"" for men. ""We get to sleep with as many women as we want!"" What ever happened to feminists like Germaine Greer who say that ""no sex is better than bad sex."" Hello, my promiscuous fellow women! Wake up! You are fools! There's a reason why so many single promiscuous women are unhappy and depressed. Get a head on your shoulders!"
1,"hesitant to express ""rage"" about the book's insipid thinkin","Dressed up in rhetorical lace stockings and punctured with logical holes, promiscuities propogates the worst in modern ""feminism"" with its regurgiation of retro dichotomies such as good girl/ bad girl and madonna/whore on a level more simplistic than the iconography displayed on a Madonna CD album cover. What's infuriating is that in this new game of narcissistic feminism, she might well playa def ear to legit. criticism of her book and consider insted that her outre, risque thinking is in fact because she has touched so many buttons. pity for th girl in the exquistite painful throes of adolscent sexuality to happen upon a book lacking in any imagintion and intelligence. Good girl? Bad girl? Please. Why doesn't she become a grown up womand and write for grown up women?"
1,a very slight commentary:,Why do people care so much what other people think about them? This book is more of a whine and a moaning lament on what the author imagines other people think about this and that and so-and-so. I believe a true liberation of spirit would come from simply stating: Who cares what you think?
1,Hated it.,"Wolf's book is a memoir, plain and simple. She can dress it up with social commentary (complete with the use of tired jargon like social ""scripts"") and she can fill pages with gross generalizations on the adolescent experience of girls, but in the end, it's just a memoir, and Wolf's publisher did her a great disservice by marketing this book as anything other than a memoir. The reader comes to the book with high expectations and puts it down feeling duped."
1,Not what I expected,"One would assume that the celebrated author of Fire With Fire and The Beauty Myth would no doubt break fresh intellectual ground with her report on female adolescence, Promiscuities. However, one would be assuming way too much. While Ms. Wolf can work wonders with the manipulation and interpretation of facts and statistics, her anecdotal attempts in this book fall just short of pathetic. Dull, simple, and obviously contrived, her memoir-style prose is an insult to all women, especially to those outside of the narrow scope of her focus. I wouldn't recommend this flat, lifeless, unimportant work to anyone."
3,It doesn't support Windows NT,"I just want to remind potential buyers that this program CANNOT run on NT, only on Windows 98. I just received my order from here. But I have to return it. What a hassle!"
2,Can be a nightmare to setup,"First I had to add a second hard drive ( this is normal ) but I had to upgrade my bios since it did not recognize big drives.Then, setting up the card propelled me back in the 80's: interupt conflicts with the Video cards, shutting down the machine several times, moving the cards to different slots,etc...Still did not get it to work. By the time their tech support concluded that maybe I got a bad card, I past the 90 day waranty period and I am [upset]."
1,It's no good for PAL DV Cameras,"Before buying this DV card, I looked carefully to see if this card is only for NTSC systems. Surprisingly, this info is not available anywhere and after hooking up my PAL DV camera, I ralized it's not working ... total waste of money as I am outside the US and returning would cost as much as what I spent on the card."
1,Pinnacle support sucks,"I do not own this particular product, but have had the missfortune to deal with Pinnacle support because of one of their other products running havoc with other programs in my computer. Programs that they admit should have nothing to do with the Pinnacle product in question and that do not interfere with my Pinnacle product. In my opinion Pinnacle support is a lazy bunch of people doing whatever they can to avoid working for their money. They will return your emails promptly but only to let you know they won't help you."
4,Great product for beginning editors,"I've been very pleased with this product after I got it installed successfully. My computer was installed with Win 98 (first edition) and it just would not work even after installing all of the patches and updates from Pinnacle. I upgraded my machine to Win 2000 and it has been very stable since. Also, my machine is an AMD-K6 400 MHZ, 128MB RAM with a 10GB drive and I would say that this is the bare minimum that you can successfully capture and playback videos using this product. Anything less than this would take forever to render your videos and your storage would dissappear within minutes. I've used Adobe Premier at my employer and it is just overkill for just editing family/vacation videos and the learning curve is large. I've found that this product provides a more than enough editing features for the home user without being too basic to make it useless. I give it 4 stars only because of the hefty hardware and OS requirements."
2,BE SURE TO RESEARCH OTHER OPTIONS,"Pinnacle Systems has an EXCELLENT name in the business of DV.HOWEVER, there are many different solutions out there. (Even though Amazon only offers three products by Pinnacle at this time, check out Pinnacle Systems's site for more information. Also check out Adobe's page for links to other solutions.)Be sure you are getting what you need. In short, be sure to research the different packages that are out there. Firewire is pretty much firewire, since it has to conform to IEEE-1394, but the software packages differ greatly.Myself, I'm gunning for something that has Adobe Premiere bundled with it."
1,Pinnacle is a nightmare with support,"I work for a major university as a digital video expert. I decided to go with Studio DV and Premiere in order to have both an introductory (iMovie) level solution and a prosumer (FCP) level solution on my home PC. I figured I could use Premiere and my wife could use Studio DV.In a year, I have never successfully used the software. For awhile, I gave up and only used Premiere under Windows 98. Now I have moved on to Windows 2000 and I can't even get the firewire card to work with Premiere. So, in the end, even the card they sold me is worthless and now I find myself having to go purchase a new firewire card.I have decided to buy a new solution that includes Videostudio 6. It gets good ratings and I know people who use it with no problem. Also, I have been to their site and they do a good job of support.Do not buy this product and do not buy the idea that ""Studio DV is the iMovie of the PC."""
2,Maddening Program with amazing possibilities,"Since installing Studio DV I've had to install the newest patch, correct several filename errors (the patch changed them to DOS fomrat), moved the capture card to several different slots, tried to free IRQs, and written/called tech support too many times. I still have not been able to complete a single project.This product has great possibility -- being able to capture and edit home videos for under $100 is, perhaps, too good to be true. I know some have had luck with the program but I recommend anyone who wants to purchase this first go to the Pinnacle Support Pages first and see what others who have purchased the package have gone through."
3,Studio DV is great once you get it to work.,"Studio DV is easy to use once you get it to work. Win 98 SE is bare minimum Operating System. Windows 2000 is much better as it support larger hard drives and more memory. With FAT32 file size is limited to about 20 min of video but I've done 1.5 hr of video with NTFS formated drive. For Win 2000 if the hard drive(s) don't go into DMA try turning off DMA in the BIOS. Also, programs like NERO CD ROM burning software interfere with outputing video to tape (it took me 6 months to figure this out) and require a complete unistall (beyond what Windows does)."
4,Lovely music,"If you want to have the choir of an English Cathedral on tap, them this series of cds is for you. Whilst Anglican chant does not have the greatness of plain chant from which it derives, it nonetheless has a lovely english charm. It will evoke fond memories of vistis to english cathedrals where the former greatness of England (an England rooted in faith) takes architectural form."
3,"Neat watch, too large","Nice, quality watch but EXTREMELY large, which makes it very heavy. It seemed to me to be more for a man's wrist than a woman's. I returned it and got an Invicta Baby Lupa instead. If you're in to very large watches, then go for it."
4,Panasonic Hybrid phone,Very satisfied with the Panasonic KX-T7736B speakerphone. I have 4 hooked up to our phone switch and have had no problems. System works well for our business
5,Must have if you have the KX-TA824 control unit,Good office phone and a must have for the KX-TA824 control unit. Makes programming a cinch.good quality overall a good bargain
5,good deal,I took a chance in buying a used product and was very pleasantly surprised. a new one would cost me almost $100 more!!
4,Great,The SNK NEOGEO Pocket Color Console in blue is a great console that lets you experience old games in a different perspective. Overall this consol is Fun to own.
2,neo geo,"The product picture included 6-games, it came with no games at all just the neo geo pocket. I feel I have been misled! otherwise I would have bought the one with six games from ebay. very unhappy being misled!"
2,Directions Unclear,"The directions are unclear on this product. It says to use a drop twice a day, but does that mean just a drop or an eyedropper? I need to know. I have been using a drop twice a day since it arrived, but have yet to see any difference in the chewing and scratching with my Jack Russell."
2,Didn't work for my dog,"While this product works wonders for my friend's dog, my dog did not fare so well on it. I would say its at least worth giving it a try if you're looking for a natural treatment for your dog."
1,It might work well for,"This product might work well for some things but it did not help reduce the inflammation of arthritis in my dog (a 9 year old femal boxer-black lab). It increased the inflammation. Thought it helped for about the first week, gave the recommended dose to her on a regular basis, with food. Yucca intense was the only medicine (herbal or otherwise) I was giving her. And I began to notice she was not herself. Very anxious and easily frightened. Which is not at all part of her personality. I stopped giving her the yucca intense and not long after, about 36 hours, she calmed down, was moving better and wasn't such a chicken. Overall I am not impressed nor am I disappointed because I was not expecting a miracle, just something to ease her pain. I wouldn't recommend this product because it seems to have a negative altering affect on the brain."
2,Yucca Intensive,"I tried this because of the reviews I read here, but it doesn't seem to affect my dog like others. My dog is about 80lbs and I have more luck with the AllerGFree, which I started first because this was out of stock. The taste turns him off, but after mixing it in with his canned food and dry, he will eat it. I have not seen any noticeable change in the itching my dog does after using this for about a week or so. I may discontinue it in another week or so if no other positive signs occur."
3,Worked Like a Charm...For a While,"Like so many other reviewers, I tried everything to help soothe my dog's itching during the summer months. I would try to manage it with benadryl (recommended by the vet), medicated shampoo, a vitamin C supplement for dogs, and Omega-3 supplements. Once a year I would give her a prescription of prednisone, which stopped the itching, but only temporarily. Then this Spring I started using the Yucca Intensive, and I was amazed. The itching totally stopped. Now, however, after several months, the itching is back full force. I don't know if pets build up a tolerance to the extract, or if it has a short shelf life. Either way, while she got total relief for quite a while, I suppose we'll be back at the vet's to get a prescription of prednisone."
5,Works for my Dog.,"My Boston Terrier had bad allergies,scratching,licking her paws.My Vet gave her predisone,which did work,but the side affects worried me.she was gaining a lot of weight,etc.we tried this prouduct with immediate results.Our jodie has not taken predisone for about two months.Stopped scratching and licking her paws."
1,Be Wary of Water Consumption,"I was giving this supplement to my dog to aid his recovery from an injury. I'm not sure whether or not it actually helped, but the dog was enormously thirsty while taking it and had several accidents in the house. I've stopped giving him the supplement and his water consumption is back to normal - no accidents. I didn't see any mention of this side effect in the description, so was surprised. I don't think I would recommend it since most animals who have the symptoms that may be helped by this are very likely slowed down by their symptoms and unable to get outside quickly."
1,Hm.,"In other reviews it clearly says that this product works miracles on dogs with bad hips, which is what drew me to purchasing it. However, after 5 weeks of giving doses after doses to my German Shepard she still is having hip trouble. So I would not recommend buying this. Also, the smell of the product will down right make you gag. Hope this helped."
3,Just Another Remix,"No Real Insight Into a Reimagining of these Overplayed Rap Songs With an Exception of a Few. With a Title Like 'Shady Experiment', I Was Imagining More Eminem in All of These Other Songs but to My Dismay He's Only on About 3 of the like 30 Tracks on This CD. Speaking of Which, What the Hell? Who Puts 30 Tracks on a CD? I Should Have Read the Fine Print but Joey Fingaz and Chemical Kickdrums Suck Some Major Ass While Marshall Does His Thing. Best Track Has to be the Remix to Forgot About DRE."
5,Good pan,"Bought this pan a few weeks ago and have made several pies since then. Great pan, easy to clean, nice size, good depth and it doesn't have one of those awful non-stick coatings that always flake off and quickly lose their non-stickness.Would definitely recommend this pan."
4,"Deep, heavy pan","A nice deep, heavy pan. I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but plan to try it out this weekend. The only issue I have with it at this time is that the inside edges of the fluted part are a bit sharp and rough. I didn't notice any of the other reviews mentioning this. Will have to be careful around them. (Had considered returning it for a replacement but quite frankly, too lazy.) It's not a HUGE problem, but for the price I was a bit surprised by the defect. Would still recommend the product though."
2,"Not 10.25""","Purchased this pan for a specific recipe (Emeril's Pumpkin Pie) requiring 10.25"". It is, in fact, the 9.5"" pan I purchased last year. Great pan, bad info. Had to return it, very disappointing because this size is impossible to find. Probably have to go to a specialty kitchen supply store."
4,beautiful,"These are all audio clips from the closing hymn segment of Ernie's TV show. If you like your gospel songs in bites of more than two and half minutes each, then this is not for you. That being said, the songs here are beautifully sung by Ernie and a wonderful choir. There is even an uncredited performance by legendary folk singer Odetta. The songs are familiar, the arrangments just ""out-of-the-box"" enough to be satisfying. Beautiful music from one of our most inspiring and talented singers. Note: one song has a strange sound and laughter. This was a Christmas show. Ernie was singing to children. One of them was either startled or moved by the spirit because he let out a tiny exclamation of sorts. The audience--and the rest of the performers onstage--laughed. I know because I saw this performance on a DVD about Tennessee Ernie Ford."
4,Excellent read.,I'm new to McDevitt and this was a great starting place. Good characters and a story that pulled you in and held you.
5,Great book,"ANYthing by Jack McDevitt is worth the purchase price. I've read everything by him that I could find, and he just never disappoints!"
2,Booooring!,"This book is 310 pages long. The first 240 pages describe a 'literature review' by the heroe of the book. If you like to read about people visiting libraries and reading through obscure books (that's right, you're reading about someone else reading), then this is the book for you. Finally, on page 240, the lead character flies of into space to solve the mystery that's been slooowly building.I like this author, but this book has awful pacing."
4,Interesting,"Good character development. Interesting technical concepts, but not overwhelming. Has a few good plot twists on the way to an exciting conclusion."
3,Thoughts on A Talent for War,"I found A Talent For War to be a very enjoyable read. An odd mix of genres; archaeology, war & SF. Oh, and don't read the blurb on the back of the book - it gives away the end"
2,"Not at all engaging, very little character action, very plodding story","I actually purchased this on audio and was unable to finish it. By the mid-point it still was plodding along, with Alex researching his uncles work, yet it had almost no character development to grab me and pique my interest. I was not at all engaged by him (Alex), or even the subjects of his research, and finally I couldn't take it any longer. I gave up, and frankly didn't care. I would not recommend this novel."
2,dusty,"This book was a strange experience. It was, in large part, the story of a story. We follow a very dry, and somewhat dim hero unearthing dusty histories, reading over his shoulder snippets describing vast adventures as if through smoked glass. Minutes are devoted to characters we never see again, and events that deserve far more explication are lovingly set up and then casually abondoned. On the plus side, if you are patient, the ending suddenly rouses to slam-bang action and poignancy that ties the whole effort together at long last."
2,Very Slow,"I am now halfway through this book and just can't continue. Normally I hate to quit a book but this one leaves me no choice. The book starts off with a mystery but there is very little action and nothing interesting has happened yet. It also doesn't help that large portions of the book are looking back at events that happened far in the past (of the story timeline). The origin and motivation of the alien telepath race is also unclear. It's really hard to care about anything that happens.If reading about characters visiting one library after another to research history appeals to you, get this book. If you are expecting an exciting sci-fi war opera, avoid this book.Oh, I'll concede that once in a while the character goes into a simulated reality to observe the war events (space battles). This is the closest thing to action this book has. Maybe eventually the characters find whatever MacGuffin they are searching for, but I won't bother to find out."
2,Action is plodding,Go ahead and skip to the next installment in this series. Summary: they are looing for a ship that was lost in the war.
2,Slow and meaningless muddle of sci-fi and mystery,I found myself constantly wondering why I was reading this book. Not a good effort from McDevitt who has written some entertaining if not totally original books; Chindi comes to mind. The book is based on a mystery whose answer lies at the end of a merciless litany of uninteresting and half-developed characters. I often read a secondary character's name and had that feeling that while I'd definitely seen it before I had no idea how they related to the story; then I would realize I didn't care as they would undoubtedly have little impact on the story. Skip it.
2,The SMELL is unbarable,"While the ball is fine, the smell is disgusting and even though i've had the ball out of the box and inflated for 2 weeks, even having left it outdoors for most of that time and washed it with soap and water... THE SMELL WON'T GO AWAY.The smell is so powerful it overwhelms my entire apartment, and is a complete waste of money at this point."
3,Good but not great,"I've always wanted to use REAL pie weights instead of beans. So I caved in and bought these. If you really need to use REAL pie weights, these will work great. They are heavy enough to do get the job done. However, I'm still going to use good ol' fashioned beans!"
2,Baking pie weights,Very disappointed. I thought this would speed up the process but it did not. The crusts seemed to take much longer to bake.
2,Will get a different type next time,"These were coated with white chalk-like dust when I opened the package. The case doesn't hold them after it's opened, either. They spilled inside my cabinet drawer because the lid on the case wouldn't stay closed. I will buy another kind."
3,Get 2-3,"As others have written, one bag of these is scant coverage. Get two or three. They're cheap, and it sucks to not have enough to properly do the job."
2,Didn't like them at all!,"Everything people said here is true: powder in the package, cheap plastic box, they sick to the crust, washing is a headache, drying is a problem... :("
3,Not as good as I thought,I washed the weights before I put on my pizza dough but still feel have clay power on them. Other thing it is not cover my 8inch pizza dough.
4,They have adequate weight,"They've discolored a bit. There could be a few more in the set. But, there are enough to work ok. A bit overpriced but what isn't these days?"
1,good songs poor recordings,"I would have rated this CD higher, if it were a higher quality of CD. the recordings apear to be very poor. some of the songs obviously had the speed incorrect, and some of the songs were not the least bit acurate on the speed. some very serious production problems, aparently in the duplicating process. I almost returned the CD as a reject. this is unfortunate, as some of these songs were very good songs. Please wake up compose and dominion records. this problem was in both your products."
4,Good basic unit for the price.,"Good basic unit for my intended use, which is transferring audio tapes to my computer for conversion to cd."
1,Defective out of the box,"Item was received in factory sealed undamaged box but when opened it was discovered to have a defective cassette door, Item returned for refund. Refund postage was disallowed even though I was assured that it would be refunded.P. Graygray"
3,Damaged goods,"The tape deck arrived at my door in what appeared to be an original new factory box, but the door for one of the two tape bays was ajar and would not function. I could have taken the hour or two to repackage it and return for an exchange, but decided my time would be better spent tearing the unit down and fixing the problem. After some effort I fixed the door and the unit works fine. Since the unit appeared that it may have been out of the box before, I'm not sure if this was a shipping issue or I was sent a broken deck.Good buy for the money and this TEAC works fine, but be aware of buying so called ""new"" products over the internet. I usually like to buy electronics at a store were the can be easily exchanged, but low end tape desks are not variable at retailers in my area. Maybe I just had bad luck with my shipment, or this online provider?"
3,Cassette doors a poor feature,The plastic pieces related to holding the doors closed are very delicate. The one on the right side fell off and the plastic pin holding it broke. I now have to use a rubber band to keep the right door shut!
3,Not bad for the price,"Unit duplicates tapes well but is a bit noisy. There's no way to adjust tape format , ie standard, hi-grade or metal. Also, you can't adjust volume during dubbing process. Haven't tried taping from external source but the manual says that volume is adjustable in this mode."
4,great deal,Easy to use I'm not a professional sound man but for people wanting to make copies of tapes it does the job. Has auto reverse and dual cassettes. The best deal for what you get. Easy to operate. One negative: you can't reverse or fast forward BOTH ports simultaneously. Not a major issue
5,Very pleased,We listen to audio in our house much more than watch video so our electronic equipment is important. This piece fits our needs very well as it has gotten and will get a lot of use. It is easy to use and sounds very good.
5,A very good find for the price,"I purchased this deck for my Dad to play his old cassettes. I was not looking for anything hi-tech and expensive. I got this one for $98.00, much less than what similar products were selling for at Fry's Electronics. It is easy to hook up, easy to use, and the sound quality is great for our needs. The unit is quite large, so if your shelf space is limited, you might want to check the height measurements before you order."
5,Exactly as advertised,Needed for a job which had an old requirement of a dual cassette deck.This is just what I needed.
2,Poor quality cassette player,"After owning a Teac tape recorder since 1983 that I was very happy with, I wanted a second one so I purchased this unit. What a dissapointment. It cliked and clanked when the tape engaged. It didn't have a earphone jack--my fault, I should have looked closer. After a couple weeks of use it wouldn't accept the audio feed in order to record so I returned it."
4,IT'S THE RIGHT PRICE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARENT MADE OF MONEY,"WELL WHEN I SAW THIS PRODUCT I SAID I HAVE GOT TO ORDER THIS , BECAUSE THESE DAYS ITS HARD TO FIND SOMETHING WORTH HAVING FOR LESS THAN A HUNDRED SO MY HAT COMES OFF TO THIS PRODUCT AND I HOPE THERE ARE MANY MORE TO COME"
5,cassette deck ordered unnecessarily.,"It worked fine, but then I discovered that the unit it was replacing was not working because my cleaning crew had loosened a critical connection. I decided to continue using the older unit until it fails,rather than discard it prematurely. I will keep the new unit, as it willprobably be needed soon. The other one is from 1986."
4,Real find!,This is a very simple to use dual deck that sounds great...I found the controls to require a feather touch. The solenoids controling the transport are loud. The transport itself is smooth and noise free. This is as good as it gets at twice the price.
1,Worked for only 2 weeks,"I went for the lowest cost machine, but that was a mistake I won't repeat. The TEAC W-600R worked great for two weeks (about the time it took me to dub 15 tapes to my PC). Then, the drive mechanisms in both bays stopped working and the machine began to produce loud clicking sounds. No amount of turning the machine off/on or hitting buttons worked to correct it. The unit is junk and is being returned."
4,"The next ""Big Thing""","If you like todays music you'll love these guys. Their raw sound is whats missing from todays music. Althought the production of the CD could be better they will get your attention with songs like ""Stop Me"" and ""Tribe"". These song have an upbeat feel to them ranging from a pop sound with a touch of punk. Then there's the song ""Tomboys"", a little on the comercial side which is sure to be a hit if it gets radio airplay. The rest of the CD definatly is worth a listen because each song is well rounded and stands up with todays music."
4,Storm Signals,"In the 1930's new literary forms appeared, and Lincoln hastened to try them. Storm Signals was his contribution to the mythology of the Civil War, in which, as he pointed out, Cape Cod played a minor role"
4,The only food my iguana likes,Tried many different types of iguana food. This one seems to be pretty nutritionally balanced and the colors/flavors are enough to make my picky iggy eat it. Smells like fruit loops when you open it up.
5,The Healing touch of Jesus,"This is a powerful book. Dr. Lee has managed to give the reader the opportunity to truly experience the ""healing touch of Jesus"". Because of the interactive format, it invites one to look at his own illness with the hope that only faith can provide. I highly recommend this book because it empowers one to find a path to healing through the power of Christ."
1,lasted just over one year,Mine broke just about one month after the one-year warranty ran out. I am still trying to find someone to fix it.Grrrr.
5,Excellent value for the price!,"I purchased the CD changer to replace an old technics single disc unit. I like the carousel design vs the magazines, particularly being able to change CDs while another is playing. I received the unit quickly, and it has performed flawlessly. It may not have all of the features that some more pricey units have, but it has worked great for me from the start! Definitely worth the money."
5,GREAT PLAYER !,Great CD player ! The carousel type is much better than the magazine type. Very reasonable price too.
5,Simple,"A simple CD-player with 44x sampling by a reputable manufacturer. (The laser did not read the discs, but it was happily exchanged for one that did.) If one is burning one's CDs, the old 2x sampling players will skip interminably. In a world of evolving complexity, simplicity of a basic CD-player is quite adequate, and a pleasure. No CD-R, Jpeg, etc. or other modern features!"
1,Another DOA unit,"I should have read these negative reviews. Mine just arrived. The tray opened and then it ceased to function like so many here. I was about to order a replacement and then I read these reviews so it is a refund for me, this unit is a loser."
1,No good.,"Didn't work out of the box. Called customer service; sat and listened to message saying ""you are number four in the queue"" for 30 minutes; hung up. Sent email to customer service. Received reply one week later. By that time I had returned the item to Amazon. Should have read the other reviews here before I bought it."
1,Last time I buy anything from jvc,"I noted in one review that the tray came out when turn on,this also happened to me then it began to skip. When I pressed the open button nothing happened although it showed up on the led then I tried to shut it off and I had to press the button three times. it has been out for repair twice I now have the same problems. When I called customer service I felt that they gave me the run around. In all as I said never again will I buy a jvc product."
3,Wouldn't buy it again,"The first one I ordered, the carousel tray wouldn't close (seems like they would have checked that at the factory), and with the second one, I hold my breath as the tray grinds to a close. Inexplicably, you can't load cd's while the unit is playing. Other than that, it plays cd's -- which is what they're supposed to do."
5,JVC XL-FZ258BK 5-CD Changer,This JVC CD changer was delivered quickly and at an affordable price. I have been using it for more than a month now and it is excellent. I hadsome concern over a sophisticated piece of machinery being delivered by mail but it has performed perfectly. I would strongly recommend this CD changer to anyone.
1,Unreliable.,"I am very sorry I previously wrote a favorable review of this product. I have had nothing but troubles with mine, and I have had mine replaced by JVC TWICE, each AFTER they were sent in for repairs, but were not really repaired. My brother's also has troubles, but he has decided to live with it, given the fact that JVC has not been able to give me one that actually works properly. Yes, it plays the CDs, but most of the time, when I turn it on, the door opens on its own, and the carousel turns, and then the door closes again. During that time, it will not accept any commands. The second one had a more serious problem with the disc exchange feature. I WILL NEVER BUY A JVC PRODUCT AGAIN. Given my experience with 4 new, factory sealed players, ALL of which were defective, and given the fact that they were unable to actually repair anything when they attempted to do so, I think they must be the worst company I have ever had the misfortune of doing business with. Do not buy this."
1,Good Changer While It Lasted,"We ordered this changer last December and it arrived in perfect condition - so far, so good. It worked great for eight months.But then it totally froze up in mid play with five CDs locked inside. Since we live in Hawaii and would have to ship the unit to Honolulu for service, we were concerned about the condition of the trapped CDs (and their eventual return). Trying to contact JVC for ""customer service"" is a total joke. They have an 800 number with the usual menus but it is impossible to talk to a real person. The only option was to e-mail them which they said they would answer in five days. Customer service? Well, ten days later we get a standard form e-mail telling us to ship the unit to Honolulu (which we already knew) with no mention of the concerns expressed in our e-mail about the trapped CDs.Our search of the internet turned up enough horror stories of JVC ""service"" that we've decided to heed the first rule of those who find themselves in a hole: stop digging."
5,An excellent DVD player for the price,"This is my second JVC CD changer, I gave the first one I purchased five years ago to my mother and it's still working like a champ. This player has excellent sound and the controls on the front panel and on the remote are well laid out. The disk exchange feature is nice, you can leave one disk playing while you swap the others. The only downside to this player is on the programming, you cannot add tracks to a program once it is entered, doing so stops the program and you have to start over again. This is mostly annoying when you are recording to MD or tape and realize that you have forgotten a song."
5,"Very Good Value-great shipping, too!","While I have only had this unit for a short time, it performs just the way it should. I hope it continues to be a wonderful value!"
3,A basic introduction to political scandal before Clinton,"The author does a good job of introducing political scandals since Watergate although gives a brief history of scandals of the past. Her main point is that while the nature of scandals has remained constant, the public pursuit of scandals has increased through a more agressive press corps, proliferation of ethics laws, and a dramatic increase in government oversight through Congressional inquiries and special prosecutors. She also does a reasonable job of demonstrating the effects of a scandal on the individuals it involves whether they are guilty or not. An enjoyable read but a bit obsolete since political scandals have been revolutionized by the Clinton administration."
4,"Finally, a pocket system worth carrying!","I don't know how they did it but SNK made a game system this old arcade rat loves. Forget the game boys, Neo Geo Pocket is a real grown-up with the power to deliver graphics, game play and great feel in a walkman-sized package. Try Dragons Wild or Bust a Move and you'll see why this is the best value in its class."
4,The New System in Town,"NeoGeo Pocket Color is truly the next generation of gaming. Although the system currently does not have very many games, almost all of them are worth every penny. The most recent game, SNK vs. Capcom - Match of the Millenium is the funnest handheld game I have ever played. The screen of NeoGeo is about the same size as the Gameboy, but that is the only similarity. NeoGeo's screen has a lot more colors that Gameboy and is considerably brighter and easier to see in any lighting condition. The controls of both systems use two buttons on the right side, but NeoGeo has a joystick insted of the D-Pad of the Gameboy, making controlling games more precise and easier on the thumbs, especially fighters. Overall, NeoGeo is much better than the GameBoy Color and should start giving it some serious competition pretty soon."
4,Neo-geo pocket,I love the neo-geo pocket.It's very fun.As soon as it came to me I opened it.I LOVE THE NEO-GEO POCKET.BY THE WAY IT IS WAY BETTER THAN A GAMEBOY
5,Outlasted all my other equipment,"I bought this monitor in the late 1990's, primarily for print design. Since then I have used it for motion graphics and 3d modeling/animation. It is just now starting to show it's age (time to get a new one). Most monitors last 3-4 years but this one lasted almost nine years! Oh, and the picture/color/resolution is top notch. LCD monitors may be the rage but I am tempted to stick with what works, especially for graphics applications."
4,Can't use Scan button,"I bought this one (after a lot of research) and the primary reason was Brother. I felt that meant quality. I also liked the price and the rebate (which I haven't yet recieved). I think it is a good one but I spent three days trying to get the scan button to work. After uninstalling and reinstalling and doing about everything I could think of, I finally gave up and called the 800 number. POW! It was THEN that they told me the button on the scanner would NOT work with Windows ME. I had to use the software program ""Paper Port"" in order to scan. The program comes with the scanner and it turns out to be a good program but I was disappointed that they didn't make that clear before I bought it. Aside from that I am satisfied (so far) and would recommend it if you don't mind not using the scan button on the scanner. As I said, the Paper Port program is a good one with multiple uses.. Good luck!!! ~Bill"
1,I agree...POS most definitely!,"I've never written a review before but found time to write a review on this POS because I've never been more mad at something I've bought before. Yes, it truly is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. I too have problems with the color ink running out all the time yet have never even printed in color. This happens within TWO WEEKS! Anywho, you get the point. Don't buy this fax machine....please, whatever you do, don't do it!"
1,Piece of CRAP!!!,"Do not buy this peice of crap!! Learn from my mistake. I should have researched this product before buying. Instead, i was fooled by the good-looks, low price, and many features.I agree with all the other posts about the ink cartridges. Most of the time, the thing won't receive faxes or print b/c one of the ink cartridges is ""empty."" But, in fact, the cartridge is half full!! Every couple of weeks I'm having to run to the store to buy more ink...and I don't even use the stupid thing that much. And, it won't print in b/w without all colors being completely full of ink. I will NEVER buy another Brother product again."
1,Machine Error 41,Printer is less than six months old. Eats an unbelievable amount of ink. Always getting paper feed errors. Must be on before turn computer on or can't print. Just got FATAL machine error 41 which means it will have to be returned to Brother for repair. What a total piece of junk. NEVER EVER BUY THIS PRINTER!!
1,I agree - will NEVER buy another Brother printer,"I agree with the last two reviews,which are the only ones I read. My biggest complaint is also is that when it is out of one color of ink, you can not print in ANY color. I almost never print in color, yet I have to replace my color cartridges every couple of months. My blue quit printing all together, then the other day it quit printing because ""cyan empty"". Give me a break! It doesn't even print in Cyan! How could I have used the ink in the new cartridge I just put in (because I thought it WAS empty when it quit printing in cyan).Never again!!"
1,POS Piece of Equipment,"I would like to first thank David Coberly for his great advice on tricking the printer with electrical tape -- this worked great for me too. Thanks to this advice, this printer isn't totally worthless, at least now I can print and copy black. This printer is indeed a piece of crap. I will be shopping for a new one. The only consolation, is that I bought it used and only paid $20.00."
1,I've never been so frustrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,If one ink cartridge is out all printing stops!! What if I want to print in B&W; and only blue is out?!?!??!?!Having one ink out even effects the ability to scan?? Why!!! THere's no printing!I'm going to savor the moment I take this baby out to the back yard and apply my sledge hammer to it.
1,The worst POS ever,"This is my first review on Amazon, I couldnt resist it when I seen these other reviews about this MFC unit, Please do not buy this junk as it will not work,I bought this as a standalone Fax machine because it was on sale, I receive about 1-2 faxes a month, After about three months it would not accept a fax I was expecting as one of the color inks was empty!!!!I only received black faxes.. WTF.. I never even received one color fax and it was empty. I replaced the color cartridge and then about a week later the same thing happened, I had to replace them all and then I got an error message on the screen,I think it was error 41.Brother replaced the unit but within 1 month the replacement (BTW Refurbished replacement) went on the blink, I didnt even bother trying to replace or repair, Went to the landfill and I recomend all other users do the same. Hope this stops someone else from making the same mistake. :)"
4,It is good,For the reveiws that say you have to replace the ink if one goes out it goes to the setting you have it on. I changed my print setting and it prints just fine also as for the noises they can be turned down to or set to a certain time when you are not there. I like it and it is the best compared to the crappy ones i have had in the past
3,toss up.....................................................,"I've had my multifunction for sometime and LOVED IT!I did get the infamous error 41 and I was stumped at first. Okay I called, and yes it's a wait for someone who is dependent on their system! BUT hey, I now have a refurbished one.BEFORE Error 41 entered my world I also only despised that you can't print off of the black ink. Ink is costly for this machine. I too often find that I also must revert back to a Lexmark that came as a bundle with my computer.It's a multifunction that should function with what it has!"
1,Dual Listing? See MFC3220C (no hyphen) reviews FIRST!!!,See reviews under Brother MFC3220C Color InkJet Multifunction BEFORE BUYING THIS UNIT. Seems like this is just the same printer listed again in order to avoid the bad reviews. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
1,Disappointed,"Based on all the reviews I purchased the MFC3100C model about 10 months ago to replace a HP printer I had used for 3 years. I use it lightly for home use and have not even had to replace any of the print cartridges yet. The outbound fax portion and scanner still work great but, unfortunately it will not feed paper in from the rear sheet feeder any longer. I am very disappointed in the quality of this printer. I think I will hook the HP back up and start looking for a new all in one not from Brother."
1,Beware,"Seems like a great buy, but the unit shuts down when it 'thinks' the ink cartridges are empty. I'm replacing FULL cartridges after only about 50 B/W pages. I'll try replacing one time, but if this continues, I'll have to replace the unit. NOTE there is no manual override, the printer will NOT work if it thinks a cartridge is empty. My cost? 50 pages for $20 of ink, 40 cents a page. Use Kinkos, it's cheaper."
1,You get what you pay for,"This thing looks great, but I have had two major problems1) The printer will not print if it thinks one of the ink cartridges is empty, which happens often when they are not empty: it has happened to me with nearly new cartridges. It essentially renders the device useless. Anyone know how to work around this? Please post a review if you do.2) The paper feeder does not pick up paper unless I manually hold my finger against the tension arm. Clearly inconvenient, especially if you want to receive faxes."
1,Machine Error 41,"I had purchased two different models of Brother all-in-one machines. One of them is MFC3220C and the other one was also MFC model and I forgot the model number. The machines I purchased had issue with ""Machine Error 41"" error. This error is displayed when the print head is bad or clogged up. On the internet, many other buyers of these machines were complaining and frustrated with this error code. I called Brother support and they had sent me a remanufactured machine as a replacement. The machine they sent also has the same issue and it lasted only 5 months.Don't waste your money on this machine!! After experiencing the same issue on two different models, I decided not to waste my money on any of the Brother all-in-one inkjet machines."
2,poor video,"I know they say don't run your video through your receiver, but I tried and it randomly dropped the signal for just a second or two which left me with flashes of blue. I thought it was my DVD and cable so I hooked them directly to my tv and they worked great. Then I sent it back and got a new one, but it did the same. I sent that one back and bought an Onkyo tx-sr702. Gee, what a great picture and sound! No dropped picture! It even seems to enhance my HDTV picture."
1,Fools Gold,"If your goal in buying oldies music is getting the version you remember, this isn't the compilation for you. The artists may be the same but in most instances either you're getting the original singer and different backing band or a newly recorded rendition that just sounds ""wrong"". There was a certain ambiance to vintage recording gear and the same song recorded today just will not repeat the sound it had on the original 50s or 60s track. The only tracks on this that are the original artist AND rendition are ""The In Crowd"",""Come Go with Me"",""Wild Thing"",""Town without Pity"",""What's Your Name?"" and ""Red River Rock"". The Little Richard tunes are credible versions though clearly re-recorded.BOTTOM LINE:Skip this one...."
3,Decent Re-recordings,"Unless the writing on the CD says Original Hits by the Original Artists, you're going to get remakes. While the record companies need to stop trying to ""fool"" their customers, these new recordings aren't all that bad, but, of course, if you're looking for the original recordings, you'll be disappointed. Clearly, the buyer needs to be told in advance whether songs on a CD are remakes (good or otherwise) or the original recordings."
4,For the Money you can't beat this,"I received this scanner and found it in excellant condition. Just as it was showed. Installation was a breeze, So simple. and I compare it with my other scanner which I paid twice as much and has outdone it in everyway. The simplicity of operating this scanner has never been so easy. I would recommend this scanner to anybody."
2,Installation Problems,"This is my second scanner. The software for the first one loaded without problems three years ago. I have spent a minimum of four hours trying to get my computer to recognize this Agfa scanner. Online tech help resulted in an e-mail message referring me to a URL which does not exist. Hopefully, it will be up and running before the warranty expires."
1,Not pleased with product,This scanner does not include a feature to descreen photographs scanned from a magazine. Without the ability to perform this function the scanner is essentially useless if your main purpose in purchasing the scanner is scanning magazine photos. This was confirmed with Customer Service at AGFA.
5,Simple Inspiration,"I recently came across this lovely little booklet while on a mother's retreat. Published initially in 1994, it provides affirmation and thoughtful encouragement for moms who work -- while probably aimed at moms who leave home to work, its basis in scripture and references to Proverbs 31 are really relevant for any woman who needs a little TLC, some perspective on the tremendous amount of giving she does every day, and a reminder that it's all from God. I keep it close by when I need a reminder in the midst of all of my daily craziness that my vocation is worthy, a blessing and a gift. Share this with a beloved girlfriend, and pick one up for yourself too!"
4,Old But Gold,"This book is an excellent introductory book to graphical data analysis. If you are an advanced reader, this book is a good one to have lying around for reference (especially since it costs so little and does not take up much space). The book relies heavily on the use of S-PLUS, a grapical and statistical analysis program. One thing that this text lacks is quantity of examples. The text is also lacking in that there is a lot of material in simple paragraph format rather than broken down steps of procedures. However, the quality of the examples that are included is very high and they usually encompass theoretical concepts completely. With that said, this book covers a wide variety of methods of analysis ranging from simple histograms to advanced data transformation and also touches on a bit of probability."
3,Wrong size: a 10-inch shield fits a 9-inch pie plate,"My Pyrex pie plates are larger than standard. They're 10"" pie plates instead of the usual 9"" plates. So I figured that a 10"" pie crust shield was what I needed: 10"" plate, 10"" shield, right?Wrong. This 10"" shield between one-half and one inch too small in diameter to fit what's called a 10"" pie plate -- which I learned, after getting out a ruler, is actually 11 inches from outer edge to outer edge. A 10"" pie plate apparently has an *interior* measurement of 10 inches, and if the crust goes up onto the edge, then the crust ends up being more than 10"" across.So I'm going to keep looking... hoping... trying to find a substitute for making little tents with aluminum whenever I put a pie in the oven. Wish me luck: I think I'm going to need it.Meanwhile, it will cost as much in return shipping as I paid for this pie shield, so I'm going to see if one of the neighbors wants it."
2,"Great concept, needs better material","I bought these because I was sick of creating foil shields on the pies I bake. I love that these slip perfectly on and off. However, I've found that since they're made of metal or aluminum, they actually conduct heat and cause the crust of the pie to darken faster than the center--which is exactly what I DIDN'T want it to do. That said, I have to admit that while the edges of my pies look darker than the rest, it hasn't come out burnt as it would if I were to bake the pie without any sort of shield.I'm planning on buying another brand's--something made from silicone instead."
3,"10"" mrs. Anderson's 109 Pie Crust Shield","These shields are very sturdy and work well on a regular 10"" pie pan, although they do not fit on a 10"" glass deep dish pie pan which is the reason that I purchased them."
4,Works Like a Charm,"One of my biggest challenges in baking pies is to ensure that I don't burn the crust while baking the pie itself. This shield really did the trick. It fits my best pans, and I don't worry about my crusts any more. I also took another reviewer's suggestion and sprayed the inside with oil prior to placing on the crust, and it worked like a charm."
3,Doesn't fit glass pyrex pans.,"I'm going to return these because they don't fit 9.5 inch glass pyrex pie dishes with the tabs on the sides, and that's what I have most of. I'd love to know about pie crust shields that would fit."
5,Great Time Saver!,These save so much time when cooking pecan pies. I used so spend 10-20 minutes cutting aluminum foil to put around the edges to keep the edges from burning.
1,pie shield???,The cheap flimsy ring was not what I had expected; it was not worth the money. Don't waste time or money on this. The photo is deceiving.
5,A must have for pie 'bakers',"I swear by these shields. When baking a cherry pie, I had used the shield to prevent a burned crust, (forget the part about 'stopping the pie from bubbling over') but when I removed it with about 15 minutes left to go the filling almost did 'escape' from the pie and make a real mess in the oven. It is so lightweight that it will not effect any crust designs. I am using the 9"" on my 9"" pie pans and have no problems at all, the fit is perfect. I would recommend the shields highly."
1,Mrs. Anderson's Pie Crust Shield,Within 10 minutes of the pie crust shields being on the pies the crust was burnt. Pies came out better without a shield.
1,way too small for pre-made 9 inch pie crusts,"this is for 9.5 - 10"" pie crusts. Most pre-made (store bought) pie crusts are 9"". It DOESN'T cover any of the crust to keep it from burning. Useless! DDD---, FAILURE!"
2,Shield doesn't fit any of my pie plates,"The problem I have is not the oft mentioned being too big, but the cutouts for the handles of the pie plates are too narrow for any of my three (different) pie plates. To get them to work I have to extend the side cut-outs with tin-snips making the sharp. Very disappointing overall."
5,Very pleased! Good doing business with you!,"I am very happy with my purchase. I love making holiday and non-holiday pies and trying to keep the crust around the edges just browned instead of burnt is always an issue; but with my Pie Crust Shields, I can make a perfect pie everytime!Thank you again!"
5,No more burnt crust,Nice aluminum crust shield. Easy to wash and not as heavy as the silicone shields. Didn't smash my pie crust as did the heavy silicone.
2,9 inch shield is too small to make 9 inch pies!!!,"I should have read the other reviews... doesnt fit my 9 inch pie pan which i bought along with this... the product saids fits 8.5 pies to 9 inch, which means its on the small side.... now to get a 10 inch shield for 9 inch. waste of 5 bucks."
3,Doesn't fit!,"I bought these for 9"" pyrex pie plates. Good idea but they don't fit. They are labeled for 9"" pie plates and the pyrex plate says 9"" BUT the shields don't even reach the edge of the pie plate, never mind shield the crust. I don't know what pie plate they would fit, but if you have pyrex, you better go larger."
4,Almost,"This is a nice kitchen helper but unfortunately it is just a little smaller than the 9"" piecrust I have always made with a fork crimped edge. The crust edge needs to be back inside the edge of the pan a bit."
5,Can't bake without it -- a must have,I am well known in our community for my delicious pies. They often sell for $100's at church and city auctions. I have used these pie shields for years and would not bake a pie without them. The shields do a great job of assuring that I don't have burnt edges on my pies. I spray it inside with Pam non-stick cooking spray and put it on the pie before it goes in the oven. Remove it when there are 15 minutes left in the baking time. Your crust will be perfect when the pie is done. The shields are worth every penny of their low price and go right in the dishwasher. They can be used over and over and are so much easier (and more environmental) than trying to fit aluminum foil around the edges of the crust. Get two for when you bake at holidays.
2,Doesn't fit my 9 inch pie pans,"Will not fit your nine inch pie pans if they have any kind of rim. They do fit the nine inch disposable foil pans, so I decided to keep the shield. I have some old pie pans from Baker's Square and this shield fits them. I have to use the 10 inch shield for my 9 inch corningware pie pans."
1,Make sure to order a size up!,"I'm writing this in the hope that prospective purchasers realize they need to order a size up. Measure the *outer* dimensions of your pie plate. My glass Pyrex pie plates are 9.5"" inside diameter, just over 10"" outside diameter. This shield will not work with my pie plates.This is truly disappointing because I have a Mrs. Anderson's pie shield and it is *wonderful* to use - so much easier than fashioning one out of bits of foil. Once you get the right size/shape to fit your pie dishes, you will love it.The other issue with this pie plate is that it will not fit any pie plate with ""tabs"" or handles on the sides (also the case on my Pyrex dishes). It is a solid ring all the way around with no indentations (the way my current one has) to fit around the tabs. So even if this thing were the correct size, it still wouldn't work because of the tabs.I think the only pies this shield would protect are those made in those little disposable alumnium pans."
2,Wrong Size,"Very disappointed. Made 2 9"" pies and wanted to use my shields for the first time. They did not fit. I should have gotten the 10"" ones for a 9"" pie."
1,Mrs. Anderson's 10-inch PIe Crust Shield,"I don't know who thinks this will cover the edges of a 10-inch pie plate. It absolutely sits on the top of it. Nice for a 9 inch pie, but not for a 10 inch pie. I was very disappointed in the inaccuracy of the description. After having paid shipping and then return mailing, I was MIFFED!"
3,works but was hard to remove,"wish it was teflon coated, it would have been easier to remove after my pie bubbled over and washing it would have been a lot easier."
4,helps a lot,I use this product whenever I make a pie. It definitely works to keep the crust from burning. Others that I have tried do not have a wide enough space underneath to fit down tightly on my glass pans.
1,"Beware: Description is dead wrong. Does not fit a Pyrex 9"" pie dish.","The description of this item reads ""...Excellent size for 9"" frozen and homemade pies. ..."". Sorry, this is dead wrong!The inside diameter of the lip on this shield is 9 1/4"". The inside of the lip on a Pyrex 9"" pie dish is 8 7/8"". The outside rim of the same dish is 9 7/8"". Bottom line is the advertised dimension of this shield is approximately the size of the shield, NOT the size of the dish its expected to be used on which is somewhat counter-intuitive.I suppose that you need to order the 10"" shield to fit a 9"" pie dish. The 9"" shield probably would fit an 8"" dish, And, if you have a 10"" dish you're just out of luck. I don't know if this is typical of all shields or just this brand.I've rated it poorly not because it doesn't work. I've rated it poorly because the incorrect description caused me to order something that is absolutely useless in my application."
5,Good things come in small packages,"This is the most effective leadership book I have ever read. It is straightforward and real. It contains all of the information that leaders know, but don't want to hear. What is significant, is the title. It's not titled, ""Listen Up, Manager."" It's ""Listen Up, Leader."" Leaders must influence, engage, and enroll employees. Managers complete tasks and oversee. This book provides all of the employee thoughts and whispers that you may not hear. The content is invaluable and timeless. Everyone in leadership needs to read it. Ten times better than ""Who Moved My Cheese?"""
5,Excellent,I enjoy this author's work. He is to the point but has a point. This book is about real world leadership problems and what you can do about it. It is not a leadership strategy book but a guide on interpersonal relationships.I enjoyed his Monday Morning Leadership even more. Both are excellent!
1,excellent advice!,"This book is simple to read, to the point, and is absolutely on the money in my opinion. An excellent book to give to new supervisors!"
5,Best Purchase of the Year!,This book was my best purchase this year! I recommend for any police officer or academic who's interested in understanding the relation between the victim and the police.
4,absolutely fantastic book on SVG,"The basics it has. It introduces you to the coding needed for a great start into designing SVG. A few header errors may frustrate in the beginnning, but with a little reading, they can be overcome."
1,Horrible,I bought a small travel size bottle of this stuff since I was going on a trip and it was cheaper than my usual contact lens solution (Opti-free Replenish) so I used it and my contacts were not clean and they could barely stay in my eyes. I had to keep taking them out and using more solution to clean them. So last night after getting back from my trip I used my usual lens solution and my contacts are all better now. If I could I would have given this product ZERO stars.
1,Very irritating after a few days,"I've used ReNu and after about two days of soaking my lenses in the solution I noticed irritation and stinging soon after putting my contacts in. My sister had the same exact problem, so I know it couldn't have been the lenses. I use Amo multi-purpose solution and it's always been better. If you have sensitive eyes I would recommend using something else."
3,Neo geo cup,"THis game is fun at first, but when you play it a long time it gets boring. The contols are easy, but it is hard to pass and score. i wouldn't recommed this for a older child but for younger children it would be fun"
2,don't like it,I don't like it because it makes my thread becomes too loose and I retighted and it becomes loose again!
2,The Complete Chinese Cookbook - Hardcover (Mar 1993) by Jillian Stewart,"This book has a full page picture for each recipe but, sadly, the recipes are not very good. There are a few nice looking ones but the rest range from the uninteresting to the downright unappealing. There appears to be little in here that is more than only vaguely Chinese. I would not even recommend it to beginners."
5,Great recipes!,"We purchased this cookbook several years ago and liked it so much we purchased 5 or 6 more for friends! Ingredients are easy to find and recipes are quick, simple, and DELICIOUS!I have a friend who would like a copy, and I have been searching for her, but now find the book is out of print...PLEASE reprint. This is a GREAT cookbook!"
3,Full of Lead,"First of all Johnny Angel above has no idea what he is talking about. Zan left the band of his own free will thinking that he could have a better solo career without them. The band was then forced to look for a new singer but found one in their bassist Tim Skold which is not really a stretch since he shared lead vocal duties on the first Cd anyway. This Cd is a set of demos including a cover of The Ramones ""53rd and 3rd"" from the second coming disc recordings which has nothing to do with the change in style that they took on in the bands 3rd and final effort Violent New Breed which only had Skold and Harry from the original line up on it. Violent New Breed is more industrial driven where as Second Coming and this I Want More EP are pure rock driven tunes with catchy riffs and hooks and a rhythm section that is missing from the other two. There is a lot more focus on the music than the first disc and Violent New Breed. Over all this is a great companion to the Second Coming cd."
5,Outstanding! The best of the best.,"This book is outstanding. Although a number of authors have collected and published winning recipes from county and state fairs, this book (along with the others in the series by Margie Jensen) really stands out. Each recipe is preceded by a very helpful explanation or description -- proving that they're tried and true, and often family heirlooms. Every recipe I've tried has been extraordinary."
2,Sexual Laws of the Middle Ages,"This book is a detailed, difficult to read chronology of sexual morality laws from ancient times to about 1563. It deals mostly with canon law. It explains civil laws as well but not as in dept as I was expecting. It is filled with footnotes. The information provided in the book pretty much answered all the questions I had on sexual laws in the Middle Ages. The problem lies at the end of the book. I do not recommend reading Chapter 12. It is filled with the author's own liberal and modernist opinions of which I was not impressed. As a matter of fact I was highly offended as a practicing Catholic. Do not be deceived by the Catholic award on the back cover as I was. The author's views are clearly not Catholic. Had the author not expressed his own liberal opinions and suggestions I would have enjoyed the book more."
1,Defective cameras,"The Canon S400, S410 and S500 have all had serious reliability problems. Read the reviews on this website and you will see that many customers have had a mysterious 'memory error' and/or the lens jamming (E18 error). These problems have shown up at about 18 months on all of these models. Since Canon hasn't fixed the problem in over 3 years since it first started showing up, I wouldn't want to bet that the new SD300 camera won't also turn into a paperweight after 18 months.Oh - I forgot to mention that Canon will 'fix' the cameras for $150. Nothing like turning a defective camera into a profit center."
2,Review Canon powershort SD300 4MP,"I bought a brand new camera which I expected in a seal box/container. However, I received my camera in an open box, which I think it might be already used or it is a returned item. So far it function ok. I hope it perform well"
5,Perfect little camera,"I bought this camera looking for something compact, and something high quality though. That is exactly what I got. I love it because it is so small, it fits nice in the pocket, and if you buy a carry case it is still small enough to wear on your belt without discomfort. I really enjoy this product, it takes great pictures, and it was a great price too, i saw it in stores for $100 more at some places."
4,large screen in small package,"given the diminutive dimensions of said big time. Seriously, I'm not much of a gizmo guru, but the camera takes good pictures. I'm just afraid I'll swallow it in my morning eggs."
2,LCD screen cracked,"I had mine for about 3 weeks before my LCD screen cracked as well. If you find that it is hard to believe, (...). The camera, itself, takes good quality pictures, but the LCD screen is much too fragile. I sent my camera in and they sent me a bill of $114.05. I had heard from other people that they were not willing to waive the fee, but I decided to give it a try anyways. I simply asked the representative why my camera was not covered under warranty and immediately she says, ""Okay.. this will be a ONE TIME free repair"". So, if your LCD screen was cracked.. send it in, give them a call (nicely), and they'll fix it for free. Once I get it back, I'm selling it and buying a different camera. =)"
5,Nice camera and very inexpensive!,"I love this camera! It works, and now I can take pictures of my beautiful one year old son! I am really thankful to Jack for selling me this camera. It shipped so fast! I recommend him 100%."
5,Canon Powershot SD300,"Great camera for the price, compact size is a huge plus, battery life is above average, and with a larger memory card (512mg) I rarely need to think of charging the camera or emptying the stick. The video quality is surprisingly good, and the photos are everything I would expect and more from a pocket digital camera. Overall, I am thrilled with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a point and shoot digital camera."
2,Too fragile - avoid.,"I strongly recommend not buying this camera. What you get in features, you lose in robustness. The battery cover is plastic and flimsy. The worst is the large LCD screen - there is absolutely *no* protection against minor knocks. My screen cracked after two weeks and I honestly have no idea how it happened (and have to pay big money for repairs)I wish there would be a digital camera that is as robust and well designed as my iPod...."
3,"Great Camera, but suffers from terrible red eye problem","I actually waited for Canon SD300 to come out for about 3 months. I got it as soon as it was out. The feature set is great. I like taking pictures in the manual mode. That way I have control over ISO settings, exposure, white balance etc.The picture quality is fine. Not over the edge but decent. The biggest complaint I have with this camera is the red eye problem. The problem persists even when you turn on the red eye reduction. If your subject is looking right into the camera, you will get those devil eyes almost every time. I've had other digital cameras where I never had to turn on red eye. And with this camera even when red eye reduction is on. The results are terrible. I am truely disappointed at this. Canon!! You're better than this...you could've done a better job!!"
3,This WAS a very good little camera,"Before the LCD screen gave way, this was a very nice camera. The screen breaking my have been my fault, because i take every ware with me, like snowboarding in CO. and to the beach in bermuda. it had nice features and was extremly small and compact. When snowboarding i kept it in my jacket pocket and you couldnt even fell it. It seems that im not the only one with an LCD problem if you just google SD300 LCD you will see some other complaints."
4,Canon Powershot SD300... great camera!,"The first SD300 that was shipped to me was defective. I was concerned that maybe the camera was a bad product overall, but I know many others that own Canon Powershots who love them. I decided to give the camera another shot. I exchanged the defective one for a new SD300 and I LOVE the camera. The flash does not have a long range, so indoor shots are very dark, but I love the LCD screen and for the purpose that I use the camera, it is perfect for what I need. It is tiny, and that was an important feature for me. It is sleek looking and the zoom is decent. For basic memorabilia, this camera is perfect. For anyone looking for a nice camera that can fit in your purse and keep track of all the important events in your life, I highly recommend this one! For anyone looking to start their career in photography, there are far better cameras out there to suit your needs."
3,Research What You Want Well,"Moving up from my Minolta Dimage x20, I wanted a smaller camera with greater megapixels and better video. The SD 300 gives you that and more. My challenge is what I took for granted. You can not zoom while taking video with the Canon as you can with the x20. The was a big downer. Also you can only date stamp a photo in the postcard mode (1600 x1200). Again I could date stamp all photos at any quality level with the X20. Since I store and view all of my pictures on computer, visible dates are important.The SD300 is good little camera. Just know what you like and make sure you get it when looking to upgrade."
3,Amazing size but the red eye function doesn't work,"Great size, great features, fantastic movie mode. The image quality is okay - not great, and the red eye function doesn't work. If the red eye function worked, then I would rate it a 5 star."
2,Small Size and Great Video can't offset quality/blurry photo,"I have owned an S400 Canon and have been very happy until it recently died. So, I sent it to Canon for repair and decided to go ahead an upgrade to the latest/smallest version of the Canon compact camera.The size, feel, weight and video on this camera are incredible. I wouldn't want it any smaller and the video far exceeds the quality and duration of the S400. However, I had over a third of the photos come across as blurry and the image wasn't quite as clear as this camera's predecessor.I am not a pro photographer and use this strictly for fun/recreational use. I don't have the ""serious"" camera but only one everyday camera.I think Canon is close to a perfect product but needs more work.With the success of the S400 and S410 versus the number of negative comments against the SD300 (and quite a few positive), it is clear the Canon gave up a little too much to compress the footprint of this camera."
5,It actually does everything it said it would,"So the reviews usually hype up things that end up not being that important afterall, but I just got this camera and it really does do all those things they said it would.The movie mode is amazing. I got a 1GB card and this doubles as my videocam.It can take really close up photos, which makes it very useful for work.Photo quality and color is great, as with all Canons I've used in the past.The burst mode really does work. I can take 10 photos in a few seconds while moving. I tested in this in the shop and got clear photos of the entire showroom.My other top choices were the CasioZ55 (gorgeous, but movie mode not as good), and the Pentax Option S5 (strange coloring, didn't like the last optio I bought for fathers day). In the end this Canon was the best choice by a slight margin and I got it for an amazing price."
5,"Great pictures, very small!","This camera is incredibly small (it can fit inside an Altoids tin). The pictures are just as good, and the flash is good enough for darker scenes. The video mode is convenient, but not very feature filled. I am not a serious photographer, but everything I want to capture, I can. In some cases, there were two compacts, this one, and a Sony Cybershot, and the Canon had superior low light pictures."
1,LCD Cracks when menu button is pressed,"I bought the SD300 for the holidays, but the LCD broke when I pressed the menu button on the back. This happened three weeks after purchasing the camera, and Canon's warranty won't cover the problem. To fix the camera, the cost is a whopping $155.00! I consider this a defective design and I certainly do not recommend this camera to anyone."
1,Fragile LCD spoils a wonderful camera,"I loved this camera, for the first two weeks. The, after a day in the moderate cold (above freezing), the LCD cracked -- which some quick web searching reveals is a common problem with this model. I'll be sending mine back to Canon for repair (at their expense, I hope, though LCD cracks are in the words of the warranty a sign of ""abuse""), and I look forward to its return. It's a wonderfully tiny, very fast camera that takes good snapshots and movies. I'd give it five stars were it not for its fragility."
2,The Dreaded E18 strikes again,"This is a pretty good camera with some drawbacks, but apparently CANON has a lens problem that I wish I had known about before I got to Cancun. The Lens jams in the open position and then all you get is a small ""E18"" message before the camera shuts down. Resetting the camera has not worked. Apparently this is a continuing problem from other models so do your research. Hopefully Amazon will credit me, since I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. I should be okay till January 31st, otherwise it would be off to the repair shop...and that is as good as buying a reconditioned item for full price. Wait and see if others report this problem."
1,LCD cracked after 2 weeks,"LCD cracked in my pocket 2 weeks after we bought it. Didn't sit on it, didn't bang it into anything. Loved this camera otherwise. Great movie mode, navigation, etc.I read the reviews ahead of time indicating that it was fragile, so was very careful not to abuse it. I suppose I could've bought a case or screen protector, but figured it was at least engineered well enough to survive in a pocket. After all, previous cameras and cell phone lcds always have.Luckily, J&R; accepted the return and refunded my money. Feature-wise, I haven't yet found anything else I like quite as much as the SD300."
2,"Sharpens well, but motor gave out after 10 months...","I purchased this sharpener (from a different store) in January of 2012. I loved the way it could sharpen our kitchen knives. We used it about once a month on about 4 knives. After 10 months the motor crapped out. Wouldn't you know it, but I can't find the purchase receipt for this item, so I'm out of luck on the warranty. I really should just take the time to learn to sharpen knives the old-fashioned way--no plastic gizmo with plastic parts that are bound to break!Update: If you take the top casing off and remove the plastic fan blade you can clamp a drill onto the shaft and use its motor instead. Works great! All sharpening will now have to be done in the shop rather than the kitchen, but it's making the best of the situation."
1,This thing sucks.,"I have been sharpening my own knives for over 30 years. While time consuming I can sharpen a knife that you can literally shave with. I had hoped this gizmo would be a quicker way to sharpen kitchen knives. After multiple different attempts to sharpen different knives, I have decided this is junk. It is so bad that I could put a better edge on a knife in 2 minutes using a concrete block as a sharpener. I have two friends that have the same result."
1,Poor Performance,"I purchased a Chef's Choice model 310 today. My plan for its use was to sharpen our kitchen knives. I had previously worn out ceramic stones and diamond dust coated stones over the years. I have a few very nice pocket knives I also wanted to sharpen. The literature accompanying the Chef's Choice 310 warns that this electric sharpener will sharpen beyond your expectations. What an understatement. My comlaints are as follows. The motor is loud, as if the bearings are loose and poorly lubed. The side edges that guide the blade grab the knive's edges which causes the ""sharpener"" to stop turning. The diamond wheels scar and deface the finish on the blade. The diamond wheels leave deep gouges that cannot be removed by the finish wheels. Although ii is ""assembled in The USA."" It is made in China. I'm taking it back to the Bass Pro Shop where I bought it, and looking for a better alternative."
1,Maybe I also got a bad one,This Chef's choice model 310 was purchased last year and just tried now. Read the directions carefully several times and then followed them. Stage one left a very rough edge and certainly not sharp. Stage 2 smoothed out the roughness left by performing stage one but the knife was NOT sharp. Then took the knife to my old manual Chef's Choice sharpener model 460 and that quickly left a nice sharp edge just like it has been doing for several years. I should have stayed with the model 460.
4,Not as good as a professional sharpening or by hand but...,"Even though I normally use a diamond sharpening block and know how to check the angles of the bevel, I have to admit, this device is quick and easy.It gives an acceptable edge as long as you use it according to directions. It is convenient, as it can sit on your counter or be pulled out of the cupboard in a jiffy. So you tend to keep your knives sharp. The problem with hand sharpening is that it is finicky work that takes time. This is faster and easier, so you tend to do it oftener.A sharp knife is actually a safer knife as it cuts easily. If you force a dull knife, it can slip and make a nasty cut. (The worst cut I ever saw was with a knife too dull to cut wax. It had no edge, but made a nasty, torn gash. The user was forcing the dull edge through wax and got injured.) So keep your knives sharp and in a block and use them with respect. This sharpener will certainly help you do that."
5,"Simple operation, very good results","I have a small collection of not very expensive knives ... chef knife, slicer, boning knife, santoku knife, assorted paring knives. Before each use, they get treated to a few strokes with a sharpening steel. Always thought they were pretty sharp.The difference after being sharpened on the 310 was very significant. The test was slicing tomatoes thinly and they all worked much better than before.Operation is simple. Felt slightly awkward on the 1st knife, but you get the feel of it pretty quickly, and once you do, the process goes very smoothly.With a product like this, who needs to spend a fortune on knives? Some time ago I bought a KitchenAid santoku knife at Walmart for ... I'm going to say ... $15. First use was a disappointment and it's been sitting idle since. Ran it through the 310 and now it's a winner ..."
2,just OK,"This product can take a knife that was never sharp and put an edge on it, but, My best knifes that I use all the time, it does very little to make them sharper. I am not impressed with this item."
2,Jack Aikins,"I was sharping my first knife and it quit running, The next day I thought I would try another knife and it quit running as I was sharping it also. So I think it was defective and returned it. I haven't ordered a different one yet but need a knife sharpener. When I do order one it will have to have the grinding wheels."
5,Nice,Inexpensive - perfect fit - easy to install !! Exactly as described on site. Great purchase and makes the bike look a lot cleaner.
5,Perfect,"I have anemia, and my doctor has recommended that I take iron pills for the rest of my life. He recommended SlowFE, but it made me incredibly sick, and I did not absorb it well. I switched to this product 4 or 5 years ago, and I love it. It doesn't make me sick at all, and it absorbs well. My doctor is also happy with it. The pills are mini, but are still a little on the big side. At first I would gag if I accidentally tasted one, but I've been taking them for so long I don't notice the iron taste anymore, I actually just notice the vitamin C, which is not a problem. Would definitely recommend."
5,Wow.,"If just the groovy cover alone doesn't already make you want to buy this single, the songs certainly will. No, Not Now is one of the best songs on Make Up The Breakdown, it has it all. Catchy vocals, great keyboard, bass, guitar, creative drumming. This songs takes several turns throughout, so it's very unique. The live version of This Town gives the listener a taste of the live Hot Hot Heat experience. It's great. And 5 Times Out Of 100 is a lovely reminder of how wonderful the EP Knock Knock Knock is, so you should also buy that when you purchase this single :)."
4,not as good as i expected...,"it's a very good shaver, but i expected a closer shave... it's really hard to shave under the jaw and it's really anoying to have to pump the gel... but on the bright side, it's really great for people with sensitive skin because there's hardly any irritation, also the battery lasts for over two weeks (and i have to say i use it every day and sometimes twice a day...). all in all i do recommend it and i think it was a good purchase.."
5,MOTOWN IS DOING RIGHT BY DIANA,"This is a must for any true Diana Ross fan. First of all, you get the original solo album remastered and then alternate versions, four songs from the aborted Bones Howe album and then the topper, a live version of ""Something's On My Mind"" from Diana's first solo tour. I was in Diana heaven. Now if we could only get Motown to release TCB and GIT on DVD! This reaffirms why that first solo album was always one of my favorites!"
3,Diana's first solo project after the Supremes!,"This album was Diana Ross's first solo project after leaving the Supremes in 1970. This album has some slow tracks on it such as ""Dark side of the world"", and a cute track called ""Keep an Eye"". This album also has what would become Diana's signature song ""Reach out and touch somebody's hand"". This album was not the monster smash that Motown would have hoped it would have been for Diana's first solo gig without the other two girls - actually, Mary Wilson, Cindy Birdsong, and Jean Terrell, Diana's Supreme's replacement, beat Diana to the top of the charts in 1970 with their hit record ""Stone Love"", and ""Up the latter to the roof"", much to Berry Gordy's chagrin. Diana would actually have to release a few more albums before she got the really big hit record she needed to solidify her solo freedom, and she actually didn't do that until ""Love Hangover"" in 1975."
5,The Essential Miss Ross,"In the hands of writer/producers Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson, Miss Ross comes across as sexy, confident and very soulful. Her acting skills are on display on such tracks as ""Dark Side Of The World"" (confusion and sadness), ""Now That There's You"" (joy), ""Reach Out And Touch (Somebody's Hand)"" (optimism) and of course ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" (confirmation). The arrangements by Motown vet Paul Riser simmer with grace and excitement (check out the thundering horns on ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough""), while the background singers sing with gusto. The four excellent alternate cuts produced by Bones Howe (Fifth Dimension, The Association)would have been perfect for her second album, the slightly pop-oriented EVERYTHING IS EVERYTHING.This debut album is essential Diana along with SURRENDER and THE BOSS, two other Ashford & Simpson produced albums."
3,The Interim Rocks,"I've had this album since I was a little boyso I was not drawn to buy this for the originalmaterial. It's the Bones Howe stuff that interestedme most. I Think ""The Interim"" is Ross' mostbrilliant vocal performance ever. She does ok with""Lines"" and ""Stoney End"" but those were much bettersuited for Marilyn McCoo and Ms. Streisand Thealternate tracks are merely filler here.I think 1971'sSurrender had the better batch of Ashford and Simpson songs though."
5,Delightful,"If you like well acted, well written comedy/dramas, you will love this. The main character is a brilliant-but-unappreciated detective whose real passion is cooking. He wants to retire and run a restaurant, but his boss, who knows that his own rise in the police force would not have been possible without him, blackmails him into continuing to work part-tme for the department. The characters are interesting, and the stories are well plotted. I have the second season, and eagerly await the third. (Check out New Tricks, too - another winner.)"
4,"So far, so good","Have only watched 2 of these as yet, but am already intrigued. This policement reminds me of an overweight Columbo, but the endings aren't quite as pat. I love the idea that he just wants to open his own restaurant, but his boss keeps him from fully retiring, due to his excellence."
2,not what it could be,"As a lover of all things mystery and most things British, I'd hoped this series would be a winner. Unfortunately, it just didn't cut it for me. While I enjoyed the characters and set up there are just too many misses in the mystery department. I think it's because far too many times the detective acts so out of character for one in the police. I know, I know, he's 'out' of the department, but that makes it worse. It's not unorthodox methods, it's reacting in a way that no real detective would consider.I wish I could see season 2 to see if they 'fixed' this problem as I enjoy so many British mysteries such as Rosemary and Thyme, Midsomer Murders, Poriot, etc. Pie in the Sky would have a lot going for it...if it would just take ITSELF a bit more series where the mysteries are concerned."
2,Clymer manuals,"I've purchased about 6 different books so far by clymer for different marine engines. All the books are incomplete or missing ""need to know information"". I buy them because their better than nothing. I've been to about four different mechanic's schools and already have an understanding of mechanic's. The books give me some helpful information on specfications, etc. For the money I buy used books if possible, knowing they don't cover everything. Even factory books don't cover everything and they cost 3 times more than these books. Some information is better than nothing."
5,Johnny Seven,"""Complicated Mind"" follows on the heels of Johnny's 1997 gem ""Joy and Sadness"" and 1995's ""Big Medicine."" Those of us who've seen Johnny play like to think of him as New York City's best kept secret. I first caught Johnny Seven while having a few drinks on the Lower East Side. I was blown away. And I thought Lou Reed was street smart. This Bronx guy is to NYC like Springsteen is to NJ, just a little grittier. With this latest release I don't think Johnny is going to remain a secret much longer. This is what rock and roll was meant to sound like. Go Johnny Go!"
5,Johnny Rules,"As a personal friend to one of the members of this band, I think that this, their third CD is the best one yet."
5,Breathless is great!,"This book has a fresh viewpoint! I was so relieved that this wasn't another cop on leave, never love again, partner dead, carry all the guilt typecast! The characters were presented in new, believeable ways. I was surprised several times by how the story turned...it didn't fit into any of the ""usual"" plots. Great book for a rainy day. Well written, funny, smart, developed plot and lovable characters!"
4,Great Scanner but not yet for Windows 2000,"Love this scanner: easy setup, high quality. Unfortunately, bought new computer with windows 2000 as operating system. HP scanner web site says HP will have W20000 drivers out in Spring, try NT 4 drivers in meantime. Don""t work for me, miss my scanner very much, hope they mean Spring 2000!"
3,Don't buy the s20xi,"If you want this scanner buy the plain s20 and do not buy the s20xi. The difference is in the software that comes with it and, for approximately 100.00 more you get to be the proud owner of software that is 2 years out of date and, in general, junkThe scanner works fine"
2,Do NOT get this. Go for a Minolta Dimage scanner!,"Do NOT get this scanner. Get the Minolta Dimage Scan Elite (or the slightly lower end if you want to spend same price as this one.) I did quite a bit of research before deciding on this scanner, so I'll sum up for you what took me many hours. I also considered a couple of the lower end Minolta Dimage scanners, as well as the Nikon Coolscan and the HP Photosmart S20.Essentially, they all promise to scan 35mm film, and with an adapter, it can also do APS. However, promises are just that - empty for most of these scanners. The problem with the Photosmart 20 is that it doesnt have a proper ICE image cleaner and film scans poorly. The Minolta line is MUCH better.This one is OK if you dont mind some bad scans and a SLOW SLOW tiem for each scan. Go for a Minolta, in my opinion."
1,Not Recommended !!!,"You have been warned...do not buy this scanner!It dates back to the Windows XP days, and HP has never updated their software. You might be able to get it to work in Windows 7 in XPMode, but good luck!Even under WinXP, the USB communication was always flaky.Scan quality is good. If you can buy one for $20 at a garage sale, then it might be worth it."
3,no win ME,This scanner worked really well for me (I scan a LOT of negatives). The only complaints are:-noisy scan-DONT WORK WITH WINDOWS ME! There are no drivers and this makes it very hard when I depend on this scanner for work! So I need to get a new scanner now :(Besides that it scans well
2,Blech - it's really bean-y,"I have read so many wonderful reviews of garfava flour over the years. I finally gave it a try by making the pancake recipe on the back (with an egg substitute).I tasted the batter and was overwhelmed by the bean flavor. One of the things I liked about the online reviews was that people said the flour wasn't bean-y. I figured the bean taste would not be an issue after cooking. The finished pancakes were better than the batter, but still too bean-ish for me. I was barely able to get down two pancakes and that was after soaking them in maple syrup. I gave the rest to the dogs.The flour was light and the texture of the pancakes was very close to pancakes made with gluten. I can see how it would be a wonderful gluten- and grain-free option, but I can't get over the bean taste. Ew."
3,This is a good product and it works ...,"This is a good product and it works to relieve my eye irritation. My biggest problem is that it's really hard to use. I like eye drops better than eye ointment. But other than that, it's a good product. I feel like it works better than my eye drops."
2,The product was difficult to apply and I'm ...,The product was difficult to apply and I'm not sure that it helped. I prefer eye drops as opposed to this product.
2,I'm not certain what the purpose of this ...,"I'm not certain what the purpose of this product is. The packaging certainly didn't make it very clear. I think it's for dry eyes. However, this product was gel-like and very thick. I was hesitant about putting this in my eyes. Because it's so thick, it blurred my vision for at least an hour, which was worrisome and irritating. I don't think it did much for dry eyes. I won't be using this product again."
5,Great product,"This is a great product, endorsed by the Mayo clinic and without irritating eye preservatives. I had been suffering from undiagnosed blepheritis for years until I found this product. I can't continue to use it because the postage and packing is exorbitant from Sams and I can't find anyone else who sells this particular version. It is disturbing when some distributors charge so much for p&p when others charge one sixth of the price for the same type of product."
3,eye lub,"lubricant is a bit difficult to put into the eye as it doesn't dissolve very quickly, so sometimes it just fall onto the lower lid and not into the eyeball itself"
3,Functional,"It does the trick! I always wanted to make square quiches, and now my dreams have come true!"
1,RUSTY -- RUSTY -- RUSTY,"Upon receipt this item was perfect, and did its job well. I made beautiful quiches with it. I liked it so well I bought a second one! However, over time, and I have owned them for probably 8 years now. They are nothing but RUST ... I have taken care of them well, handwashed, dried completely, stored safely to no avail. I can't cook anything in them anymore for fear of the rust leeching into my food. I would not recommend."
4,Girlschool - 'Screaming Blue Murder' (Castle Music) 4 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1982,as 'Screaming...' was the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal's(only?)all-female band's third record.Very nice job on the CD reissue.I wondered as to WHY I've never seen this title in stores before,apparently this is it's first pressing on compact disc.You get the album's original ten rockers,like ""Live With Me"",the ass-kickin' ""Don't Call It Love"",""Hellrazor"" and ""Flesh&Blood"" plus eleven(11)bonus tracks tagged on from a 1982 BBC Radio One In Concert shindig.I mean,come on!Who could possibly resist?A must-have."
2,"too fast, and DRM sucks","The workout is too fast for chair exercise at some points of the video for seniors to do, and trying to get this off my main computer, and onto a DVD is a crock, Amazon should not be selling stuff like this with such restrictive DRM, they don't do it with there Mp3's, why do it with this??? 2 stars for effort."
2,Not really chair exercises,"There are positive aspects to this video. The work-out has integrity, but there are too many exercises done standing (yes, really!) and the pace isn't user friendly -- too fast with not enough explanation of the movement. Paul Eugene is cheaper and does a much better job."
1,Gave it away - useless DVD,"Most of the time these reviews are correct, however, I teach Tai Chi/Chi Kung to seniors and thought I would do a varied workout in chairs so I ordered this on previous reviews. Even though seated my seniors could not do the repitions this person is doing. To me chair means there are limitations for the person doing the exercise so movement need to be modified, which is not the case with this DVd. Just felt I wasted my money!"
1,Put your clothes on...,I didn't even order it.I turned on the trailer and the sweat shirt was off and the bra was all there was.Yuk.Who wants to look at that?
2,Not really as easy as it sounds,I purchased this video for my sister who has disabilities but does chair aerobics at the senior center. She enjoys exercising at an easy pace but this video is too fast for her to follow. Even the older woman in the video looks bored or annoyed at times.
4,Go For It,"This is a great video for all of us who need to sit. It provides the option for a more rigerous work out if you perfer or if you can work up to it. It will keep me going for a long time,"
2,Not for everyone,"If you have any mobility issues, this is not a video workout for you. It is fast-paced and does quite a bit of standing exercises. The older woman in the video looks like she's in a lot of pain and discomfort throughout the entire program and the guy gets lost trying to follow the female instructor.So, if you've got joint pain, difficulty standing, or decreased range of motion, I would not recommend this video."
3,"Good exercise, bad sync","This is a good set for people like me, recovering from foot surgery, that don't want to turn into a complete lump. The exercises are as strenuous as you want to make them, and she makes it clear which person to follow. You'll work up a good sweat! There is a problem... the music must have been inserted afterward. If you're listening to the music to get the beat for the exercises, you're out of sync with the leaders. If you're listening to the leader, you're out of sync with the music. So, consider the music as background, and just go with the leaders."
3,Not for EVERYONE,"I bought this DVD looking for an exercise I can do while recovering from a knee injury. The title IS ""Chair Aerobics for Everyone"", but it's not for anyone that can't move their legs.When I'm recovered enough that I can bend my leg, I think I will enjoy this workout. The title is mis-leading tho."
4,Pretty good,"It's surprising how well exercising from a chair can get your heart rate up. This is perfect for me because I have bad knees and, when they ""act up"", I'm unable to exercise the ""normal"" way. However, these chair aerobics DO require the use of your legs to really get things going. If you're wheelchair bound, it may not be the aerobics for you."
5,Spoken Word,Really enjoyed the movie. The story is timeless and crosses all cultures. It is the story of a prodical son. The New Mexico setting is beautiful and especially appeals to me. I recommend the movie.
5,Outstanding,"A beautifully written and acted story about the ultimate importance of family, authentically laced with the unique culture and heritage of Northern New Mexico. Bravo!"
2,Disappointed,I was going to give it to our daughter who has 8 cats but it wasn't funny enough and tossed it.
4,Pretty darn good!,This is my first CD Player in a very long time and I am glad I purchesed it. I love the fact it has a control[don't cll me lazy] but I find it annoying to walk across the room just to switch the cd or skip a track when you can lift a light piece of machinery and press a button or two then go back to what you were doing before. This is defiantly a good buy!
5,Excellent purchase,"This is an excellent knife sharpener. Easy to use and very effective. Sure beats long sessions with a sharpening stone, even more so when you don't know what you are doing. Highly recommended."
4,"Sharp knives, takes practice","I've owned one for five years and my knives are razor sharp. It took me a little practice before I realized I was using it correctly, though. The directions could be better, and the machine doesn't provide any feedback to distinguish proper sharpening. _Cooks Illustrated_ magazine found that they could get knives sharper with this device than with the higher end models."
4,sharpener,"overall a good product, took time to learn it, but it is worth learning and using. I had several dull knives and it did a good job of putting edges back on. Important, do follow the instructions.Chef's Choice 110 Professional Diamond Hone Sharpener"
3,Haven't Totally Decided,"I've used this once for all of my knives. I bought it because a friend recommended it and loved it. I found it not so easy to use properly (keeping the knife at the proper angle) even with the magnetic sides. The blades do get sharper but I think they should be even sharper. The unit leaves tool marks on the blades kind of like serrations. Maybe it's just me. I will try it again when I want to take the time to do it, but right now I'm not impressed. I do believe I should have just bought new better knives."
3,Works well for wide blades,"Works well for wide blades but narrow blades get sucked down next to the wheel and beveled at a very shallow angle. Also sometimes the knife handle interferes with the housing, preventing sharpening of the last inch of the blade. Also puts a rather rough edge on. But it does get a very sharp edge on a chefs knife very quickly. If I was to buy again, I would probably avoid the magnetic knife positioner of this model and go with a more expensive spring positioner model."
2,Only good for kitchen knives,"The way it works, it pulls your blade through. This sounds good in theory, but I had a hard time controlling it. For me, it took off too much metal and it was difficult to get the curved part sharp (hunting knife with more curve then the average kitchen knife). For pocket knives or any blade with a guard, I found hard to get them close enough to sharpen the entire blade. I would give it 4 stars if it had a disclaimer that it only works well with kitchen knives. Maybe that is supposed to implied as it says Chef's Choice, so I give it 2 stars instead of 1."
2,my own fault... for not shopping around,it is easier to take things back to a local retailer if you think something is wrong with a product. i believe the sharpener wheels are misaligned so the knives are being unevenly sharpened. it does take off metal. i'm going to do more practicing and not on my top of the line knives.
1,Caveat Emptor,"This thing is a ...joke. Yes, I've tried everything suggested in the instuctions, including holding my hand just so. Curiously, it'll make a grocery store rubber paring knife about as sharp as it will make real carbon steel knives. My guess is, that was the design goal. If you want to sharpen your rubber knives, this is your machine. It does a lot of impressive vibrating and stuff but it doesn't really sharpen knives. If you want one of these, mine will be for sale soon on e-bay."
4,happy,"Over the years, I tried a variety of sharpening methods. But none of them worked very well so I put up with dull knives. Until now.The Chef's Choice sharpener does a superior job.I found the more you use it the better results you will get.Practice makes perfect."
2,Just not what I'd hoped.,"I knew that any powered sharpening system was suspect, however when I received the 110 as a gift I gave it a try. It is such a poor sustitute for an easy hand powered system like the EdgePro. No comparison. The 110 scratched the face of my expensive knives. It produce only a moderately sharp edge. I am now only sharpening with the EdgePro System. Wickedly sharp knives in half the time and no worries about scratching the face of expensive knives. The EdgePro takes less metal and produces an edge that this machine can't touch. Do what you want. I'm sticking with a system that works. EdgePro."
5,Best Value,This is the first automatic sharpener I purchased. Far better than manual sharpening and my son recommended this one which he has. Does a great job on non-serrated knives. I now use some Japanese knives received as gift which were dull. I priced other models and makes and the Chef's Choice 110 is a best value.
1,Chef's Choice 110 sharpener,I sharpened three Henckels knives and did not obtain the razor sharp results that were promised. Have not sharpened the rest yet. Would not purchase again.
2,really run of the mill...,"there's just not much distinction between tracks on this disc. It's slightly pretty melodic trance, a bit of harder ""darude"" sounding stuff, but it just doesn't really get into your soul. There's a tiny bit of vocal here and there, and an occasional riff that catches your attention for a moment, but for the most part, it sounds like the kind of indistinct ""rave"" track used in any club scene of any movie in the 1990s. Track times:1. Armageddon (5:24)2. Feel free (6:44)3. feelings (4:48)4. Angel dust (8:04)5. The best (3:21)6. Exodus (4:58)7. To the rhythm (6:57)8. Future trance (5:51)9. Universal nation (5:57)10. The hurricane (5:36)11. Touch me (7:14)12. The orange theme (5:39)"
4,Still a Standard Text,"Very well written and with a comprehensive explanation of the basics of advanced quantum theory. This is the place for understanding about computing propagators and Feynman diagrams to arbitrary order.Plus, the Dyson equation! At last, you can find out what made Freeman Dyson famous amongst physicists. You can decide whether this ranks in importance to Feynman's and Schwinger's discoveries.The problem sets are nontrivial. Which will be appreciated by you, AFTER you have attempted them. (Whilst you are in an allnighter, trying to finish a problem set, your opinion may differ!)The book does not cover superstrings, because those came after its publication."
2,difficult read,This is a classical book referenced by many papers. But it is not easy to read. The notations are out-of-date
5,Great S-Matrix Theory Development,"Very clear exposition of S-Matrix theory. Unfortunately, it is hard to find all the pieces in any one text; even for just these few points, it is worth picking up the text just for those few sections that clearly derive the formalism."
4,Great insight on the many -particle systems,This book is a clever and classical textbook for physics graduates who wish to go beyond the one particle quantum mechanics. Its many problems helps establishing the concepts of field theory.
1,Disappointing,"This book is a real disappointment. Chloris, the title character is a then 11-year-old coping with the suicide of her father some three years earlier, a selfish mother who isn't even nice to her and her pampered princess of a sister, Jenny. Jenny narrates all the Chloris stories and the favoritism the mother showers on Jenny is sickening. Poor Chloris had to contend with the fact that her father squandered her inheritance, leaving her nothing while spoiled little Jenny gets it all. The stupid mother slaps Chloris and treats her like dirt whenever she is angry at her which is frequent. She never seems to relate postively to Chloris and appears to be conditioned to disapprove of anything connected with her. A must miss."
1,DEPRESSING,"Poor Chloris has a lot on her plate. A favored, bratty younger sister, a father who committed suicide some three years earlier and a mother who shouldn't happen to a mongrel dog. Chloris' father squandered all the insurance money that she was supposed to inherit, but leaves bratty Jenny well off. What a bummer. Chloris has a vain, spoiled, immature mother who craves the attention of men. After remarrying a man named Fidel Mancha, Chloris rebuffs Mancha and refuses to let him adopt her or her favored brat of a sister.I hated the way that disgusting mother would go on slapping sprees to Chloris. I also hated the way she would talk against Chloris to goody two shoes Jenny and refer to Chloris as ""your sister."" That mother belonged in the wastebasket. This book is a real downer. Skip it."
4,TEAC W-860R Cassette Deck,"Good Audio quality, many options for reasonable price. However the transport mechanism is too noisy and cassette comparment covers/eject nobs substandard (poor). Overall a good Deck.Challa S.Dubai"
4,Women rule,"Abby McCall is a garden architect living in the UK when she receives news her sister, Libby, has disappeared. Libby, a research scientist living in Alaska, has developed a device that could make her rich, or dead, if the people hunting her get their hands on it. In spite of a bitter estrangement, Abby battles the bitterness of the Alaskan winter, and memories of a romance gone badly, to rescue her sister.It's nice to find an author who writes a solid action thriller in which both the protagonists and villains are strong, smart, yet realistic women. At the same time, they are not over-the-top, anti-men either. Elements of the plot were a bit over the top. The romance was somewhat unnecessary and, at times, annoying. Carver is no Stabenow but I definitely found myself quickly turning the pages through this non-stop read."
5,"Villa -Lobos, I love Him","Stravinsky is reported to have said on hearing a piece of music, ""Oh, that is bad, it must be Villa-Lobos."" Well, he is right. This is not music that Stravinsky would have liked, but it is music that I love. After having grown up with music from the 17th-19th century, I was immediately taken in 1960 when I purchased a 33-rpm recording of a String-Quartet by Villa-Lobos. From that point on, I continued to enjoy most 20th and now 21st century music. These string quartets are among my favorites and I would recommend them to all who enjoy great music."
2,Poor workmanship,I purchased this item because of a good experience with other company products and a family reommendation for this particular item. The diamond stone has not been fixed exactly parallel to the sides of the wooden base casing and so the lid cover does not sit squarely on the base. It is not worth sending back from Australia but if the manufacturer wishes to distribute internationally they need to do more than just have US address and telephone in the internet age.
3,"Decent stone, never needs maintenance","I have had mine for many years, and it still is perfectly flat with the original grit. However, you must remember that this is a coarse stone. I would recommend a 4000 grit water stone to finish the job."
5,Milk Carton Holder,The product is exactly what I wanted. It will meet our needs perfectly. There is nothing more that I can add.
5,milk carton holder,"I looked all over to find this product. I used to get them at The Container Store, but they quit carrying them.This one is actually better anyway because there is more room for the carton and milk spills along the carton don't cause the empty carton to stick to the holder like the ones from TCS."
4,a bit of nostalgia,I was looking for one like we had when I was a child. My mother-in-law has arthritis in both hands and can no longer grip a milk carton. This was just what she needed. The only thing is...I should have bought two!
5,Handy Handles!!,"The milk carton holders are very sturdy and allow me to use 1/2 gallons of milk and juice. I have arthritis that is progressively getting worse and these ""handy handles"" allow me to function well in at least one area. Thank you for them."
5,Handy Handle,I purchased this item for a family member that has difficulty handling half gallon containers. They are pleased with how it works. It fits both plastic and cardboard milk containters. It fits well on shelf on the door of the refrigerator.
4,High End Mountain Bike at great price!,Shimano components thru and thru. Suspension is great. Excellent build quality. Highly recommend.
4,Takes a lot of abuse and keeps on going,"This Mongoose just doesnt die. I take this on some rough rides including a lot of 1 and 2 foot drops but it just keeps riding smooth while it is taking the beating.The quality is not what I would call amazing but it is still decent. It turns on a dime and the tires are holding up really well. There have been times where my buddies have gotten stuck and I have not because of the tire treads and the gearing so I think it is a bike that it worth the money if you like rough going in the woods, etc."
5,Absolutely Great!,This product is really great. I think it is more than what I paid.Tire is little lower quality but don't have any complaint with it.Great to buy! and great to ride!Go with this bike
5,It's a steal.,"I can't believe I got this bike for $180. Almost paid for a similar one from Sports Authority last Chirstmas for $299. I don't expect this to be a serious mountain bike. I am a small guy and I am not a serious biker, this one is fantastic. Love it. You cannot beat the price anywhere.It took me about 1 hour to remove and assemble together, Need only 3 tools. Pretty simple."
5,Great Looking Bike,Ordered this from Amazon for 149.00 with free shipping.Was upgraded for free with DHL 3 day.Received very fast.Bike was easy to put together with a few allen wrenches and a flathead screwdiver.Front tire easy to put on with quick connect tension lever.Upgraded seat to a gel filled.Bike is a 24 speed with frnt disc brakes.Just completed assembly in a short period of time.App. 15 minutes/Comes with instructions/You install handlebars/Front tire and disc brake/Slide seat rod in and air tires and assembly is complete.Reflectors are preinstalled.Great buy and a great deal.
1,trailer dolly for super light trailers,"I tried to turn an empty U-Haul trailer around with this thing. Talk about some work. It was a dual axle trailer, so that may have made it worse. Unless your working with a light, single axle trailer, I don't recommend this product."
3,Lightweight,A little lighter weight than I had hoped and there were not directions as to how to put it together. If there wouldn't have been a picture of it don't know if I could have figured it out.
2,Not what I expected,"This pan was not what I expected. The trees are too shallow and provide enough product as a spritz cookie. It did arrive on Christmas eve, but I probably won't use it."
1,It's February and the watch don't work!!,"I'm not sure the reason, but it's bearly been two months since Christmas and this watch no longer works. I will try to contact the seller in hopes they will make good on this sale. If so, I will print a new review. Thank you."
1,"Easy to revise History, hard to impress historians, me to.","The facts remain unchanged Arnold went over for money. He was an ignorant bigot that would have stood out sooner or later as a paranoid glory hunter, frustrated elitist. His character was that of what he was trained for, a merchant, his country became the only commodity he could deal. Peggy Shippen, the valley girl of her day made him think it was a great idea-Duh!. He occupies a place in out history that he deserves. He was deserving of every vilification that his countrmen and those he took up with could heap on him. Professors of history have to write books periodically. It is a good thing that we all do not have to buy them. I returned mine to the public library. Joseph D. McMillan Charleston, SC"
4,"Reveals the real BA and his spirit, like reading a novel.","Kirby tells this dramatic story in a very accessible style; his book reads almost like a novel. Instead of feeding us wives-tales and caricatures, Kirby gives us a real human being, and shows us both Arnold's brilliance and the beginning of his fall. Stops at the Battle of Saratoga, rather than taking us through the treason, because the fundamental change in spirit has already occurred by then. For a continuation of the story, read the more scholarly flavored Benedict Arnold, Patriot and Traitor, by Willard Sterne Randall. Both books give great insight into revolutionary politics and leadership. Randall especially quotes many original sources."
3,Good on the First Half,"I agree with reviewers who said the first half of the book was most compelling. It really was, and I loved it.But, then the family moves to Sydney and there are absolutely endless pages of the author's education in various schools.A page turner, as in I turned a lot of pages and skipped them entirely.It's beyond me why this book was a best-seller."
4,Inspirational Story for Girls and Young Women,"This book describes the journey taken by young Jill Ker (Conway) as she transitions from an outback to academic lifestyle. The first 11 years of her life are spent at Coorain, the family sheep farm in Western Australia, where she and her family face oppressive heat and isolation before an 8-year drought and the death of her father drive the Kers east to civilization. Between caring for her aging widowed mother and adjusting to a typical social adolescence, Conway grows to appreciate the delicate balance between duty and desire. A bright student, she studies honors history at the university in Sydney before eventually moving to the United States and becoming the first female president of Smith College. This book not only provides vivid descriptions of both Australian landscape and culture but also is a great inspirational story for ambitious, academic young women everywhere."
5,Absolutely loved this book and the narrative,"The Road From Coorain is one of the best books I have ever read. I just watched the film version and it, too, was excellent. Jill Ker Conway is such an accomplished storyteller and author - to be admired for her insight into life and the workings of humans. I have ordered all of her books to be loaded to my Kindle and I cannot wait to start the next book. Excellent writing."
2,Mostly boring,"Jill Ker was born in 1934 in the west of New South Wales, Australia.She grew up on a sheep ranch.She had her share of troubles: her father drowned, possibly it was a suicide, when she was 11. At age 14 her charismatic elder brother died in a car crash. In her 20s her mother began to lose her mental balance. Jill studied history at the University of Sydney and at 25 went to Harvard.Her childhood on a sheep station has some interest, but the details of her unremarkable academic studies are tedious.She comes across as an introverted person who found it difficult to make friends.She had little fun in life: no jolly japes, no humorous anecdotes.Her self-centeredness and lack of humor make for dull reading."
2,Book--The Road from Coorain,"The book was advertised as new, which it was, but it must have been new several years ago as the pages were yellowed with time. I was disappointed as this was a gift for someone."
1,The Life of a Bitter Egotist,"The main problem with this book is that the author is not unique, but thinks she is. I noticed as she was griping about her school she made the same point several times. She was having trouble understanding the lesson plans because she was not used to them, being a poor alienated bush girl. What she fails to realize is that EVERYONE has problems with schooling at a young age. Everyone wonders why they have to take speed tests in multiplication, when the problem could be solved with a little time.....Ps: That first chapter, you know, it's supposed to GRAB you. Rambling on about the topography of a gritty barren nowhere-land for thirteen pages...well, it's not exactly fascinating. ..."
1,My mother's dead so I can trash the old broad!,"... The first part describing the outback was great. As the book progresses it gets boring. I haven't skipped through so many pages in a book since I had to read about the Phoenicians in high school! This is a fine example of academic reading, ie has no direct practical application."
4,An Excellent Choice - The Road from Coorain,"I'd recommend the The Road from Coorain anytime. I thought Jill Ker Conway's description of Australia was wonderfully descriptive. I felt I was there as she described her life in the bush as well as the city. Her ability to convey her feelings and her understanding of her situation growing up in a less than idealic life came through the pages as each situation developed. The book left me admiring her strength of character and understanding.Unlike a book I recently read about the life a a political figure, I found Jill was able to touch on the emotion and struggle that life had dealt her and potray an understanding of the impact on her life. Definitely worth reading."
4,Fascinating look at the childhood of an independent woman,"Jill Kerr Conway went from an isolated Australian sheep farm in the bush to become the first president of Smith College. Her insatiable curiosity, her obvious intelligence, and her ability to transition from one culture to another with remarkable ease all account for her rise in academe.The best part of this book, IMO, is the first two thirds; after that, it gets a little pedantic, almost as if she knew she'd finished with the good stuff and was just hustling along to get it all down and be finished with it."
4,A enjoyable read,"Despite the fact that this felt long for just one volume of an autobiography, I liked it.And no, I am a male and I still didn't think she was being a sexist in pointing out discrimination. She let the story speak for itself."
3,Fascinating at first. Pedantic in the end.,At first I could not stop reading and was highly fascinated by both the content and the way this book was written. In the end the book became a bit pedantic and longwinded.
5,This book was an extrodinary peice of work.,I enjoyed this book emensily. The detail in this book was brilliant. I would recommened this to everyone.
3,Read the first part; skip the ending,"This book's premise had a lot of potential and the parts describing what it was like to grow up on a sheep ranch in Australia are great However, it goes downhill at the end as the author seems to start simply cataloguing facts. Near the end the author seems more and more self-absorbed and generally arrogant (as if the intellectuals of the world- those who think rather than do--are somehow superior to the those who actually both think and do). It's such a switch: from a little girl who was a hands-on, practical doer to a grown woman obsessed with obscure intellectual pursuits. One question: Why did her brothers seem so useless compared to her as children?"
4,Norelco T870,"I read several reviews of this trimmer before I bought it. This is the first trimmer I have ever owned so have nothing to compare it to other than the results. So far I think it's a quality trimmer. Following the directions it does exactly what it says it will do. The only problem for me is that there are no attachments included for contouring the inner,around the lips curves of my goatee. If you have a full beard and just need to control the thickness and outer contours I think this will work great. I haved received several compliments on my beard and moustache since I started using this trimmer. For the price and quality I would definitely recommend it."
2,Poor Choice,Be careful with this trimmer. The settings change without warning and the next thing you know your beard is gone. The vacuum unit is a joke. I recommend a cheaper trimmer without all the bells and whistles.
2,Vacuum does not work for me,"Not sure why, but at least 10% of my hair is not sucked in by the vacuum, which defeats the purpose, you still have to clean and there is still hair in places hard to clean..."
2,She Fell Among Thieves,"This was just a bit too campy for me. The two stars I gave it were for the sets and wonderful scenes. The actors were about as hammy as possible and the dialogue and story line really quite ridiculous . I cannot remember a really good chuckle. It came off more like a freak show than a farce. I purchased this dvd because one of my favorites, Judi Dench, was supposed to be in it and I did not see hide nor hair of her. WHAT HAPPENED.I usually love British period pieces. Just felt this one was trying too hard or not enough, I have not decided.Loaghaire"
5,Love this Darren Shan series!,My 12 year old daughter was struggling with her reading and this was the first book series that has caught her attention! And then my parents gave her a Kindle! She's hooked!!!!
5,I got lucky,I got lucky when I stumbled upon a Darren Shan book last year. This is good quick fun and just enough scariness and situations to pull it out of the teen series genre in my eyes but neverthess thats where you will find it.I started and read all 1-12 back to back with only a pause waiting on 12 to come out. GREAT STUFF HERE!
4,Allies of the Night,"In this book, half vampire, Darren Shan, full vampire Mr. Crepsley and Vancha March, and little person, Harket Moulds return to this city when they heard of killings which they think are the vampaneze. While they're at the city they find out that Darren was set up to go to school. When Darren was at school he relizes that his English teacher is his old ex-girlfriend. Also in the city Darren encounters with an old friend, R.V, who now was a half-vampaneze. As Darren , Mr.Crepsley, Vancha, and Harket are in search for the vampeneze they join up with Darren's old best friend Steve Leopard. As they are encountered with their enemys, they found themselves betraid by Steve. The group of vampires and little person, runs into a delima whether to save his old girlfriend or to kill the Lord of Vampaneze.If you love thrilling and action packed books then you will not beable to put this book down."
5,Allies Of the Night:Book 8 in the Saga of Darren Shan,Very nice!!! Loved it and must get to reading the 10th when mom buyes it!!! I enioy the whole series!!
5,Mother of reluctant reader,"My 12 year old son is not an one who reads for the general pleasure of reading. However, he loves this series! He discovered the series when there were only 4 books. Since then we have waited eagerly for each new book. I have ordered each from Amazon so it can be delivered as soon as it is available. I hope the author keeps writing!!"
3,OK,"I wasn't crazy about this one. I did not like the whole Debbie thing, I don't get why bring her back, makes the story so cheesy (sp?)."
2,I waited on the edge of my seat for this!!!!,I read the first Curque Du Freak book at girl scout camp when I was 11 since then I have read all the books out and waited on the edge of my seat for the next one to be released but I think that Allies of the Night was the worst book I have read in a long time. I love the books and yes I think they are very predictible but i could see what was comming next from a mile away! Im not one to critize overly but this book was just bad. You might think it was a good book but I feal i wasted a perfictly good $16.00.
4,The Best of Darren Shan,This book is the best of Darren Shan's amazing series! The reappearance of familiar faces makes the book unpredictable and even more thrilling. The bloody battle and suspenseful end make this book a must read for all who enjoy action/horror!!
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"Okay, I waited almost one year for this book to come out. I'm not going to give away the story, but to be honest, this is the most boring of the 8 books in this seires. But, if you plan to keep up with the Darren Shan character, you will need to read this story. Darren confronts the Vampaneze and runs into some old friends along the way. The story is very limited in ghoul, and does not portray Darren learning or displaying any new super-human skills or fighting abilities. In fact, it's a bit of a let down. I'm sorry. I don't want to spoil your fun. I have enjoyed reading all of the books in thisseries, and enjoyed this one too. Just not as much as the others. I felt you should know this going in."
4,Nothing here see. Keep looking,"If you LOVE tennis maybe you'll like this game. If not, don't waste your time. This is not an awful game, don't get me wrong. Everything is just too average. Average soung, graphics, color.I am guessing this was an early release and NEO GEO was trying to get a quantity of games to market quick. In most cases they did a good job, however this is not an example one one. There are just too many better games for the NGPC."
4,NGPC Pocket Color Tennis,"I agree to an extent with some of the other reviews, as I personally always like to see games with a variable 'difficulty' setting. That indicates that the games stays with you as you get better.I do think the game can be alot of fun, and is very addicting. I think it is worth getting, and would recommend it."
2,under-whelmed,"Ball is very difficult to inflate: The adapters don't stay in, and when it inflates, they don't come out. I still don't have it inflated properly & I've been trying for 2 months.Also, there is no ""exercise chart"" that I can find in the package."
2,"Price was great, I can see why it was so low.","Nice idea but the projection on the bottom are useless as teats on a bull, which they resemble. The things do not do a good job of keeping the ball from rolling away but they do make it harder for you to move away from your desk.Packaging was weird. According to the instructions the inflation piece is attached to the instructions with a piece of tape, the plug, on the other hand, is supposed to be attached to the ball with a a piece of tape (it wasn't, it did not come with one but I had plenty). Why this weird system? perhaps they believe you can't figure out the difference between an inflator and a plug so they must be delivered to you via different media."
1,Horrible rewetting drops.,These leave my eyes feeling even drier than before! These are definitely the worst rewetting drops I've ever tried and I won't be repurchasing.
5,GUNG HO IS VERY GOOD,I really like gung ho it is a great comedy film. It is one of my favorite movies and features a good amount of great 80s music. Very funny.
5,"I CAN DREAM, CAN'T I?","While most of us probably don't have the opportunity to stay in many of Europe's elegant hotels, we can take a peek inside them through the pages of this volume which is as luxe as the hostelrys it features.Included are urban retreats, townhouse hotels, country inns, castle hotels, and manor houses. All are shown with both exterior and interior views.And, all are beautiful, comfortable, and extravagant."
3,por los pelos,"Los discos de Steve Howe son los únicos que, salvo Fish out of water y, por supuesto, la obra de Bill Bruford, merecen la pena escucharse, fuera de la onda de Yes. Los experimentos AOR de Squire con Conspirancy, las blandenguerías de Anderson, la inacabable serie de discos serie ""B"" de Wakeman, etc. dejan a los discos de los Yes en solitario muy lejos del listón marcado por el grupo.Los discos de Howe no solo tienen una calidad más homogénea sino que son los únicos en los que son reconocibles algunos de los trazos que hacen de la música de Yes lo que es.Este disco en cuestión no es el mejor de la serie, ni mucho menos, pero, al menos, mantiene el tipo. Siempre se ha criticado la voz de Howe, sin embargo creo que se adapta estupendamente al carácter de estos discos que siempre tienen un cierto regusto a ""obra inacabada"". De cualquier forma en este disco solo canta en 3 temas."
3,"Not bad, but nothing special","I was quite excited to get this album knowing who was playing on it. I thought it would quite interesting. Alas, it was just another good Steve Howe album. Nothing that special on it that you haven't heard a bit of from his recent albums. I thought this might deviate a bit more since it was touted as a ""band"" rather than a solo album.Notwithstanding my minor disappointment, it is a very fine record. Really good songs and top notch playing. I am sure you'll enjoy it, but if you are looking for something different from Steve Howe then don't be shocked if you don't find that here.I'd actually recommend you get the Steve Howe Rememdy Live DVD instead, to be honest. THAT is WONDERFUL!!"
5,Great fun!,I have 3 boys who play with this all the time and love it! And it has already survived 2 months of use! I am impressed and so are they!
5,Great for Older Kids!,"Both my sons, ages 6 an 9, received this for Christmas. My 9 year old LOVES it! He has had no problems loading or shooting it at all. My younger son (6) can't seem to get the hang of it. His darts keep jamming and won't shoot when he pulls the trigger. It's not the gun because he has the same problems when he tries to shoot his brother's gun and my older son can shoot both guns well. So, this gun is TONS of fun, but probably not for littler children."
1,No competition with Nerf,"Well I had 50 dollars one day and decided to buy this for $24.99 thinking it'd be awesome and be a good competition for Nerf. I was so wrong!!! First of all it isn't fully automatic which is a big setback when you have Nerf wars with your friends. Instead, it was semi auto which wouldn't be so bad if it didn't make sooo much noise and didn't constantly jam. You can modify it but you have to know what you're doing with an electrical motor. Even if you did modify it it'd still be a pain unjamming it. Oh and the bullets fall out real easily. I have to say it is pretty darn durable though. Overall, don't buy it unless it is only $10. Thanks for reading.:)"
4,Like airsoft for 5-year-olds (in a good way),"Probably the best semi-automatic Nerf weapon I have ever owned. Okay, so it's the first semi-auto Nerf gun I've ever gotten, but still... I recommend it, but be careful with it because if a dart is pushed out a LITTLE too far, it will get caught and you have to turn off the gun, unclog the dart, and then resume. Also, it really gives you an exercise while trying to find the lost darts! I highly recommend this gun."
1,Thumbs down.,"We purchased this product for our grandson it didnt last 15 minutes before the on /off switch malfunctioned. it sounds like it has a short circuit. When operating this product the ""rapid fire"" cannot operate as advertised due to lack of air pressure causing a miss fire and the darts jam up into the gun barrel and tearing the suction cups off the darts. The battery compartment door screw was stripped for the start."
2,fun toy but some problems,I brought this toy for my son for Christmas. he loves to shot it but it is so hard to turn off that when he plays with it he can turn it on but has to come to me to turn it off. it is also a battery hog just today we had to change the batteries 3 times. We are planning to use his Christmas money to buy a Nerf Long Shot.
2,Tommy's problem,This toy looks cool but is bad for stealth missions because it's battery is somewhat loud when the gun is on. It shoots far and fast but it isn't compatible with normal nerf bullets.
3,Fun concept,"My son bought this ""Blaster"" several months ago just as a form of harmless entertainment. The darts frequently get stuck in the chamber and are not snug while in the magazine. If the front of the gun is tilted towards the floor, some of the darts fall out. All-in-all, it's a fun and safe toy."
1,Do Not Buy This Gun,"Short and sweet: This gun stinks. This is the first day I have owned it and it hasn't been able to shoot thru 20 darts without jamming. In fact, it jams so much that I have already retired it to the corner of the room. I have tried the darts that came with the gun and other brand darts. They all jam, it doesn't matter which ones you use.I don't understand how this gun made it out of QA testing. Someone, somewhere along the line should have said: ""But, guys, it doesn't really do what it is made to do. You know, shoot darts""Terrible, terrible, terrible."
4,TONS OF INFO ABOUT A GREAT ERA,THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION OF STORIES AND INFORMATION ABOUT A VERY GOOD TIME ERA. AFTER THE WAR AND TO THE PROSPERITY OF THE 1950'S. THIS BOOK IS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND HAS A TON OF INFORMATION. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR THE REAL DIEHARD AND HISTORIC BUFFS OF BASEBALL. A GOOD EDITION FOR ANY LIBRARY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
2,Hidden Agenda,"Though Jackie Robinson appears (rightfully) on the cover of this book devoted to the period of baseball's long-overdue racial integration, the author's motive is to nominate Commissioner Happy Chandler as the true author of that history-making event. As a number of other reviewers have pointed out, that argument doesn't hold up under its own weight."
2,Don't buy it,"These scissors are very mediocre. I used them once. They are heavy and difficult to use, especially for women whose hands are not as strong. I got pretty tired half-way through cutting a cornish hen. They cut okay, but it was a lot of work.I took them apart and washed them, and then the springs won't let me put them back together. The scissors won't close, so I can't put it back in the original box to store.I'm currently looking for a new pair of poultry scissors..."
1,Bad design,"The first time I used these shears the spring bent and would not allow me to close them (i.e., cut anything) and there is NO WAY to fix the spring. I'm trying to find a replacement spring, but I suspect that will be impossible or expensive.Very disappointing."
3,Replacement spring? Who sells it?,I love my shears. Affter five years the big spring broke. Nobody seems to sell it .Anybody know where I can get it
4,Fills a gap in the literature,"This is a well-researched, easy-to-read academic work on the issues surrounding adopting children from China. The authors write both from first-hand knowledge as well as from results of a survey that they conducted via the Web over the past few years. It fills a gap in the literature on this topic.The book covers topics such as how and whether to impart knowledge of Chinese culture to adoptees, the legal issues involved in intercountry adoption and statistics about how well adoptees do after they've been in the U.S. with their new families for several years.It is a useful guidebook for those wishing to adopt a child from oversees, especially from China, and it is also useful for those studying adoption in general."
3,"Good, not great...","Good album, but missing the energy of some of the previous albums. I think Velvet Touch... is still their best album (although I am dying to get my hands on the Christmas CD). At times, Supersonic Guitars just sounds flat. I also agree with previous reviews that the production isn't as good. Previous LS albums have some snap to them... this one sounds a little muted. These guys really rock, but just not very much on Supersonic Guitars. By yourself an early Christmas present, and see them live."
2,Skip this one - buy all the others,"This just isn't Los Straitjackets to my ear. The tunes generally lack melody - where are all those great surf style hooks? It's all replaced by a ""heavy"" sound that misses the fun that the Straitjackets are known for. I also think Ben Vaughn's production work is sorely missed. While the recording quality is good, it has a gritty feel that would be more appropriate for an R&B record. I hope their next CD will be a return to form."
2,Uninspired and poor sound quality,"I have to agree with Bochard. There is something wrong with the sound quality of this recording. There is no presence; its like listening to a mono recording. The first three songs are also quite ordinary. The rest are good, a bit more laid back than many Los Straitjacket songs, reasonably inventive, but the playing is not as inspired as on previous albums.I too have all their albums, but I'll burn the few songs I like from this one and sell it back. If you're looking to pick up an album by these guys start with their first or second album; if you're a fan wait for this one to appear on the used CD shelf."
1,Supersonic Guitars in 3-D,"THIS IS THE ONLY THING THIS BAND HAS DONE TO DATE THAT COMPLETLY STINKS. THEY BILL THIS AS ""KILLER TONE"" THEY KILLED THEIR TONE. POSSIBLY SCREWED UP BY THEIR NEW PRODUCER. I OWN EVERYTHING THEY'VE RELEASED TO DATE AND ITS ALL BEEN GREAT UNTIL NOW BUT, I'LL NEVER BUY ANOTHER RELEASE OF THEIR'S AGAIN WITH OUT HEARING IT FIRST. THEY STARTED OUT USING VINTAGE FENDER GUITARS AND AMPS,THEN THEY WENT TO DIPINTO'S CHEAP KOREAN JUNK. NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE USING LITTLE BATTERY POWERED JUNK AMPS.THE CHINTZY 3-D GLASSES ARE WORTH MORE THAN THIS CD AND ALL THEIR DIPINTO'S COMBINED"
4,An Authentically Good Novel,"This book is very well written. The characters are rich and their reactions are real. Specializing in psychology, I may be too critical of the characterizations of the mental disorders brought out in ths book. Chemistry is a haunting, sophisticated and satifying work. This is an exceptional book that generates real emotion - it's not to be missed - it makes you want to known what's going to happen to the characters from beginning to end."
1,Boring,"Not even one star. Book so boring, I putt it down without even being half way through it. Forget this one."
4,great blue filter,This is another blue rosco filters with lush red tones. Really good looking with an incadescent on skin tones. Not for video use though.
3,Reliving Classic Rock,"These guys are straight out of the 70's bastion of classic rock, i.e. Skynyrd, Bad Co. and Eric Clpaton. Songs like the bluesy ""Stranded"" and the acoustic ""Ginger"" remind us of those days of yore. ""Wait For Me"" has a John Mellencamp-like opening. Guitarists Jake Roche and Nick Goodale show their chops off on songs like ""Eyes,Life,Change"" and ""Can't Live."" Their fat sound draws comparisons to Stevie Ray Vaughn, but a little more restrained. The bands named above are the obvious influences and sometimes the music comes a little too close to imitation instead of inspiration. That Michael Barbiero(Tesla,Guns'N""Roses) mixed it tells you this has nothing to do with the angry rock of today; which is its strength and curse."
2,gives the illusion of sharpness,"If you have a knife that's not very good to begin with, it might be okay, because it does make a sharp blade to some extent. However, the sharpening surfaces are set at a broad angle such that it doesn't last more than a few minutes. And if you have a high-quality knife with a finely-sharpened blade it will actually worsen the edge each time you sharpen it, until eventually it never reaches the sharpness it originally had. You're better off with a simple stone - it's no more difficult and much more effective. In five minutes I had my paring knife back to incredible sharpness after this sharpener had been just taking metal off the blade and leaving it dull."
3,Serrated Knife Sharpener,"I purchased this item for sharpening serrated knives. It seems to do an adequate job. I was disappointed in the fact that it only sharpens the very tips of the serrations, not the whole knife blade. My tomato knife, however, is much better at cutting up tomatoes and other vegetables than when it was dull."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This knife sharpener does not work well and isn't worth the money. If I still had my sales receipt I'd return it to the store. It barely sharpens my knives and I've followed the directions, read and reread them to make sure I was following the correct procedure. Don't waste your money on this product."
2,not so great,this product ended up being cheaply made and doesn't work too well. It sharpens knives slightly but not to the hone that is described in the manuel.
2,Fails the test of time,"When I first got this sharpener I was pleased with the results, but not impressed. It didn't give a razor edge. I know that there's a compromise between sharpness and a long-lasting edge so maybe my expectations are what's at fault. After having used the unit for about 6 months, however, I'm even less impressed than before. It seems to take longer and longer to get a knife to even acceptable sharpness.I'm back to looking for a good sharpener."
2,Not satisfactory,"I found this product very unsatisfactory. After 20 minutes of working with a Chicago Cutlery knife, some edge was produced but still not as sharp as factory edged. This product might be alright to throw in a camping box to be used where there is no electricity, but certainly no more than that."
2,"Not Exactly ""Razor"" Sharp or Easy to Use","I found this sharpener difficult to use. It did make my knives sharper but not ""razor"" sharp as the ad claims. Additionally, the last half inch of the knives were especially hard to sharpen because of the curve. I could never really tell if I was holding it right and making the rollers turn requires quite a bit of side pressure which causes the knife to ride up. After playing with it for an hour I decided to return it. I want a sharpener that makes it quick and easy. I can spend hours sharpening all my knives by myself with my whetstone anytime. I intend to keep looking -- maybe an electric sharpener is what I need."
2,Ruined my Henckel Four star serrated bread knife,"This piece of junk ruined my expensive Henckel Four Star serrated bread knife! It didn't sharpen it, it filed the serrations down. It worked fair on my other knives."
3,meh worked for a little while never worked great for me.,"For the price I found that getting a 1000/6000 combination water stone worked much better ( admittedly it's more work and effort) for me than this, which is what I got to replace this when it stopped working. Especially when you consider that if you are just pulling this thought you have a very small area to wear out."
3,A good document,"Richter and Schubert match perfectly.This version of the D.958 sonata is totally different from the one recorded on studio the same year.We here have sheer respect of the score:hardly any right pedal in the last movement,as requested!!!The songs without words are new but not very captivating to my taste,although very lyrical.A pity some part of the recital was left out:Brahms op116 and more of chopin nocturnes probably played in bis like the one on the cd.As for the Debussy I prefer the Carnegie Hall version of these Images but who would miss out any new Richter ? No-one!!"
4,Good for those with and without road rage.,"An easy read. The book contains insight for those of you who are not prone to rage, helping you to understand those who are, and aids in avoiding those who are. The high-blood pressure types who act out on the road can get some tips on correcting their poor habits, perhaps saving their own lives, and at least preventing a heart attack!"
3,"I'm OK, It's OK","If you like self-help books, this one will appeal to you. It has all the usual checklists, self-assessments, and affirmations. The book is useful in picking apart what's at work in a one-on-one situation of ""road rage."" However, I disagree with Larsen's notion that otherwise well-adjusted people just turn into monsters when they are behind the wheel. The author needs to write another book in which he probes more deeply into the life situations of road-ragers. He has also proposed, in this book, a ""report card"" system for drivers, that has postively Orwellian overtones. On balance, the book is well written, with lots of real life examples to keep it readable. One of these examples contains a glaring omission on the author's part; see if you can find it."
3,great if you've been drinking,This is a charming collection if you're listening just to sing along. Recomended for parties in which the surrounding noise will be too loud for real listening.
1,Zero stars,"Why can't we rate things as zero stars? This book richly deserves a 0 or possibly a negative number. Once again Sair has put out a trash item to foil you as you strive to acquire the LCA certification. It's easy to tell that no one at Sair gives a *(&% about quality control or actually producing worthwhile materials. If you are still interested in Linux certification, why not try LPI or RedHat. They at least spellcheck most of the materials they put out.If you are really interested in learning about Linux I highly recommend the Craig Hunt Linux Library published by Sybex. I especially like the Sys Admin book by Stanfield, et al. You won't learn bupkis from the junk Sair is putting out."
5,"Filmi, Cute, Romantic Comedy","Those of you who love the filmi dialogues and acting that a good Bollywood flick provide will enjoy this film. Imran shines as the chocolate hero Khush to the free-spirited and loveable Katrina - Dimple. While the premise of boy meets girl while searching for a bride for his brother and then falls in love with her is formulaic, the film is anything but. Sure there is some of the typical Bollywood twists and turns, but the film continually surprises by throwing a creative solution to a problem. The music numbers are catchy and fun, and the cinematography is fresh. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Just as advertised,This is an excellent set of kitchen Shears. High quality and easy to take apart (and put back together) for cleaning
4,Angsty and intense,"Very well written...almost Dostoevskian, with a similar sort of religious existentialism. Wiesel makes the best argument I've ever heard for the so-called ""cycle of violence""---but unfortunately, it's equivocal. The plot involves a distinction between cold-blooded acts of violence and those committed in the heat of the moment, but the theme depends on ignoring not only this distinction but any distinctions among any uses of force whatsoever (most significantly between an aggressor's initiation of force and the victim's retaliatory use of force in self-defense). Still, the story is very suspenseful and makes an excellent read. Three and a half stars."
3,"Flawed, but still has it's moments","This book would have been better served as short story in an anthology. I thought there was too much padding in order to make this a ""short novel"". Even as a short novel, ""Dawn"" barely exceeds 80 pages.To address the content of the story, the main theme is the futility of the cycle of violence and reprisal. The narrator is assigned to execute a hostage in a nationalistic conflict. The story illustrates the narrator's internal moral stuggle in carrying out his task. There are some flashbacks to the narrator's youth, which I thought used some mixed metaphors and didn't contribute much to the story. But nevertheless, these are largely interpretive to the reader.Certainly not as good as Night, and probably some of Wiesel's other works. But someone interested in reading more Wiesel might find some value in this book."
3,Confusion,"This book had a very slow start but as you read into it more, it got better. I did not have a very strong liking for this book because of the mindset the main character was in. He seemed to be going insane with his own thoughts and haunts of his past after he joined the Freedom Movement. Also the slow start to this book didn't have anything to catch my eye and reel me in. For people that like real life drama's and books that make you feel like your apart of the story, this is a good book for them."
3,"Cheap car charger works, but breaks","I've purchased this same car charger from eForcity before (this is my third one), and the last one I had broke in the same manner. When I pluged the device into my cigarette lighter output, it snapped most of the way apart. My second one did the same thing, except came all the way apart. I was able to snap it back together (that was super easy), but then it didn't work. My first one from the company did last a couple years, however.So with this new one breaking, I looked on the company's website for return info and there was an email address I was supposed to contact. I did that and customer service responded within a day or two and said they were sending me a new charger. The replacement charger arrived about four days later, and I didn't have to take the time to return the broken one (I did ask where it should be sent to). I guess you get what you pay for, but customer service was great; I wish there were two places to give stars to!"
3,Shallow Overview of Medieval Costume,"This is probably a great book for the beginner, but if you are looking for either a serious study of medieval costume or a how-to, you will probably be disappointed.This book goes into a lot of detail about medieval costume with little documentation to back it up. There are no tips on construction and no actual pictures. Instead, the author relies on romanticized line drawings of people in costume with the emphasis apparently on the people, rather than the costume.Once again, however, if you are an absolute beginner with little to no knowledge of medieval costuming, this book is an economical way to catch-up. It has a very wide scope. I did not note anything blatantly wrong, and the drawings, unhelpful as they are from a construction viewpoint, do show the costumes in context and as they would actually appear on the (idealized) human form."
3,Great place to start,"This book is pretty good to get a basic idea of shapes for each given period, but that's about it. Unfortunately there are no seams shown, and while it's a very small detail, there weren't cod pieces in most places where there should have been. Small, but very important, detail. None of the illustrations are original (photos or reasonably accurate drawings of sculptures, rubbings of engravings, etc.) and all have a sort of 1940s feeling to them which kind of detracts from the accuracy. The text part is pretty decent though, and if you use it for ideas in conjunction with a more construction-oriented book, you'll have a pretty good chance of making something accurate. Of course, if you're just looking for ideas on how to clothe a character in a book, it's great."
5,Triple Feature,"This was a great buy! I expected three movies on one disc, but there are actually three movie discs inside. I love Audrey Hepburn and Jennifer Love Hewitt, and these movies are terrific."
1,These spikes must have been old.,"My chinese palm is in worst shape now than when I used these. I dont think the spikes were potent enough, or they were just plain old."
2,not really what I was looking for,"I bought this as a replacement exercise ball for my teenager. Unfortunately, when I saw it as a gold box special, I was misled by the ""one ball for all"" description. A 75 centimeter ball, as I discovered, is for those 6'4"" and above. Not the case at my house. It would have been better had it come with an exercise mat. The sporting goods stores around me (Sports Authority, etc) sell a set including ball, pump and mat for $19.99. I would have done better buying one of those"
4,"Good ball, bad pump","I bought this for my husband, he is 6'4. At first the ball looked so small, like it could never blow up big enough - but it did. He hasn't used it much so I don't have much feed back on that end. However when he first pumped up the ball, after recieving it, the pump broke."
1,What a joke!,"This book is nothing more than an embittered ex-wife's attempt to make money off her accomplished husband's fame! Everything about it is a rip-off, from the outrageous mimicry of Andy's book covers, to the fraudulent use of the regiment's Insignia, to the size and placement of Andy's name in relation to the author's. I highly recommend Andy McNab's books if you wish to read tales of thrilling true adventure by someone who has paid his dues in sweat and blood.On the other hand if you wish to read the whinings of someone who has done nothing but marry someone who HAS done something...then , by all means, read this book! After all..SOMEONE has to read it...there isn't enough fish and chips to wrap to use up all those copies!"
1,yawn,"well I am not menopausal but I am a female who does dishes after I get home from work. I am also a big fan of Andy McNab's writing and recommend his books to anyone.I'm glad to say I didn't buy this book but rather mooched a friend's copy. No offense to the author it's nothing personal. But despite all the naughty bits this book is BORING and offers no insight. I will stick with my B.Davies and Andy McNab books, thanks."
1,Shameless attempt to make money,"To be honest I haven't read the book, but looking at the front cover and reading other reviews it's an obvious attempt to make money from her ex husbands success. She apparently tries to make mcnab come off as an insensitive something or other but being in the army is a very demanding and stressful job, adding a family to that doesn't make it any easier. McNab put his life on the line for his country while she did the dishes. No need to say who has more of my respect.Personally I don't like to read the whining of a menapausal woman. I'm sure this book will appeal to many bored housewives but I doubt that fans of mcnab will be too pleased with it."
4,I can relate to this book,"My ex-husband is in the same occupation and my heart goes out to this woman. I doubt she did it for the money, I think she just needed people to see the other side of this big club of Special Forces. As far as the review from sugarmonkey, I can only assume that you know this woman as you are ""personally"" attacking her. You say all she did was clean house, do you know that for a fact? Anyway I myself enjoyed the book and I think it is sad that if you have never been in that situation, how could you be so judgemental? Curious?"
1,UNHAPPY,"I KNEW ANDY, SHE HAS WRITTEN A LOAD OF DRIVEL THERE ARE LOADS OF SAS WIFES THAT ARE MORE THAN HAPPY WITH THERE LOT FRANCES NEED TO GET A LIFE AND THIS TIME HER OWN I AM JUST SORRY I HAD TO GIVE THIS BOOK ONE STAR"
4,Good product,"I don't tolerate most calcium products at all. However, this one I'm doing OK with. I mix a scoop in with a smoothie and don't mind the taste at all. I take extra vitamin D and magnesium with it to aid calcium absorption since that isn't included in the product. Hoping to stabalize and improve my bone density."
5,"Excellent, lively performances, good sound","King Oliver may have been on the decline at this stage of his career, but this is still very good stuff. If you like New Orleans jazz, you'll enjoy this CD. The sound compares very well with other recordings from 1929-30."
3,"UNFORTUNATELY, it's another ""JSP"" release.","Unfortunately, it's another ""JSP"" release. Having purchased one other JSP compilation, the Golden Nuggets Of Gospel, I should have known that the CD would have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for liner notes. I mean they could at least have included the dates of recordings. (JSP cons you into a purchase with flashy graphics.) Fortunately, unlike the Gospel collection which had a mediocre and pathetic music selection at best, this does have a fabulous handful of gems that have not been cleaned-up to DEATH (like Jazz Legends Duke Ellington: The Bubber Miley Era 1924 -1929 - ughhh!!!!) BUT they include WAY WAY TOO MANY song re-takes (if not duplicates!) in this collection. Be fore-warned. If this wasn't the case I might consider giving it ..... at least 4 stars despite JSP - those CROOKS!"
5,"If you liked The Blind Side, You'll love C3K",This is based on a true story of two brothers in a frantic cross country pilgrimage to see Roberto Clemento get his 3000th hit. It's a sweet and touching story that will have you in tears - from both laughing and crying. A great movie for watching at home with your family!
5,chasing 3000,we live in Pittsburgh and have always been fans of Roberto Clemente! Hubby and I were at the game where he hit #3000!! Bought the movie for our 3 adult sons who remember him and the night he died. It was GREAT to see scenes of Pittsburgh!!! Movie is very touching!!!!
2,Chasing 3 Stars,"Family-friendly, but flat, forced and formulaic. ""Chasing 3000"" is loosely based on a true story, but the real brothers never had to travel much more than an hour to see the Pirates. In the movie, they have to travel 2400 hundred miles and their road trip is more bland than beguiling. The best thing about the movie is the archival footage of Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente, but even this is handled clumsily, as the footage sometimes doesn't match the narration. I loved some of the shots of PNC Park, but the closing crowd scenes looked amateurishly faked. Here's hoping that this year's edition of the Pirates fares better than ""Chasing 3000""."
4,Happy Memories,"This was a pleasant surprise because it turned out to be better than average movie.Since it was based on true story and was set in Pittsburgh (my hometown) with familiar names and places, it brought back good memories about Roberto Clemente's run for his 3000th hit.This is movie I forwarded onto teenage grandsons to enjoy."
4,If you respect Roberto Clemente and his legacy,"Having grown up near Pittsburgh in the eary 1960's. My admiration for the man and his skills were very high. He was a hero to most, if not all, Pittsburgh area boys during his days as a Pirate. The movie brought back many memories and feelings of that period of my life. A wonderful movie."
5,Good things come in small packages,"I studied long and hard for good speakers. I found that in these speakers. For the price, they're a great buy for quality sound. I'm impressed. I'd recommend them to people are looking for very good sound at a right price!"
5,Great little speakers for a little price,"I have had a set of these for about a week and a half and they are great. CDs, DVDs and games (all with strong bass tracks) sound great. The footprint of the speakers in nice and small; but the sound is B I G! The rebate makes this set especially nice."
4,Good speakers - Bad service (Yamaha),"I am very happy with the speakers they are great. They are not the loudest out there but it's amazing that they are as loud as they are considering the satelites fit in the palm of your hand.My only complaint is that Yamaha was offering a rebate when I bought these speakers and I sent in all the nessecary stuff, reciept, rebate form and the UPC from the box. Then I got a postcard from Yamaha saying that they needed the UPC. And since I sent them the original I was out of luck."
1,Good for Windows - bad for Mac,"As a professional Internet media designer, I will never recommend you to buy this speaker system. When I brought this system one year ago, and believe me it works fine with most Windows Base systems that I work with, but for the Mac, I really recommend a Harman/Kardon Speaker System. Crystal Engineer Sound."
5,2002 Front Wheel Bearing,"Great product! Can't beat the Timken line for OEM replacement. There are cheaper bearing and hub assemblies out there but they are Chinese junk and don't last. Unless you like installing wheel bearings and hub assemblies, go with Timken."
5,If this is what you use,"It's some great bargain! I got three, then free shipping, then a $10 rebate for buying Boston items. Better than that, you won't find."
4,"I use the product to clean, rinse, and ...","I use the product to clean, rinse, and disinfect my contact lenses. It does a very good job for all of these functions. I'll switch to the product after I used up my current store-brand one. I recommend this product."
4,It seems to work fine. It compared well ...,"It seems to work fine. It compared well to the other brands I've used in the past, and the price is in the same range as well. Unless it was on special, though, I'd just stick to my regular brand."
3,This is a new product for me. I ...,"This is a new product for me. I usually use a different kind of solution. In general, it's so easy: one solution for cleaning, storing, and disinfecting. However, I found that it didn't clean well enough for me. I used it the first day and the next day, I felt discomfort. Then I took my contact lenses off and cleaned them with Boston solution. Day after day, I had the same feeling. I won't recommend it to my friends and family."
3,This product was ok and I'd buy it ...,This product was ok and I'd buy it if my regular brand was not available. I'm not really comfortable using a brand that I've never heard of. I don't like the shape of the bottle -- round is so much easier to hold. I think the product itself was fine.
3,"good, solid",Good outing from a solid prog outfit. Nice moody atmosphere. I actually think it gets less interesting and almost clumsy when it strives for the edgier hard rock moments. I am still finding my away around this more recent crop of europrog stuff. My impression is that these guys are a bit generic.
4,Fine first album,"I bought this CD after their second effort,Second life syndrome, so its hardly surprising that this is not quite as assured. Now that does not mean it is not a good CD, it still contains heady, intelligent rock with just the right amount of melodies, all out brash riffs, stunning ""musicianship"" all round. They each play their instruments with great accomplishment and tenacity and are worthy of being rated next to Porcupine tree, Pink Floyd, and thoroughly deserve such acclamations. If the improvement continues with each CD these guys release they may find a huge popularity and an eager audience for live shows! I recommend this to any prog fan and suggest you listen to the samplers on amazon or the prog archives, feast your ears!!"
4,Superb performance...... almost excellent,"Absolutly no dull moment, WOW is an accurate description.Band comparisons are pretty close, very very original and unique can't get enough, but this is all there is for now till the next album..... CAN'T WAIT ! ! !If you are reading this, it's a keeper...."
3,clear power,"The debut album of one of the best progressive bands nowadays. Riverside make an impact with his prog metal powerful, mix of instrumental prowess (excelent guitars by Grudzinski) and melody vocals by Mariusz Duda. Instant elaborated classics like ""the same river"" or ""the curtain falls"" combines with more lyric songs like ""loose heart"".A very good cd surpassed later by his 2th ""Second life syndrome"" and his master work ""Anno domini high definition"".Higly recommended."
3,Not Bad,"This CD was hyped as the best in ""Modern Prog"" available in the reviews I'd read.Maybe I don't know what Modern Prog is as I'm a geezer from the Gentle Giant, Yes and ELP era but to call this stuff Prog is pushing it, much like bands such as OSI, Dredg and Oceansize. It seems that Prog is any band that has a diversity of styles or musical approaches that defys catagorization gets put into the Prog bucket. That being said, this recording is OK, I really like the title track alot. The rest of the thing sounds very Pink Floyd inspired and tends to ""noodle"" around a bit. But all in all I'm glad I bought it, I think the hype helped to underwhelm me.But don't take my word for it. With the right mixture of booze or drugs it might be the best thing you ever heard."
1,Big size,"When i get this watch, i am not really happy because the size is too big for my wrist. And it is good for teenager, but not for me.It is not my style .. i am sorry...maybe i should give to my daughter then..."
4,Teac AG-D9100,"I bought this receiver for $250.00 (CND) at a costco surplus store in 2002. I am not sure what year this model was made, but it has mostly worked. Good sound for what it cost, but in the next few years I was seeing Sonys with S-Video and Component video on sale for the same price.My biggest complaint is that the front video 3 stopped working a few months after I bought it, but this is minor considering there are 3 others that still work.The remote is huge and hard to operate, but it does work with my no-name CD player i bought at a garage sale (likely made in the early '90's).A decent receiver for what I paid but with newer models with DTS and component video switching I would not buy another one today unless it was used for a cheap price."
3,Good reference but too detailed for most readers.,"This book is a valuable reference, however, I think it is probably too detailed for most readers. If you're a warehouse manager or plant manager looking for information on improving your material handling and storage areas you may not appreciate having to wade through enormous amounts of technical specs and references to obscure material handling techniques just to find the information you needed. I'm not saying that this book does not have valuable information, only that it also has enormous amounts of information that you probably don't need. If you're a material handling engineer, you may want to have this on your shelf. But for the rest of us, try the book listed below.The same author has another book ""Warehouse Distribution & Operations Handbook"" ISBN 0070440026 that is outstanding, and I would recommend buying it first."
4,Helps,"If you are starting your practice and don't want to come up with your own policy book, this is a great tool for reference! We have used it in our practice and it has been well worth the price."
4,Policies and Procedures you can use for a medical practice,Very good policies and procedures. A CD is also included so you can easily download them and make needed changes to fit your practice.The way the policies and procedures are ordered was a bit confusing at first.This is making my life as a new office manager much easier.
2,Not Worth A Hundred Bucks,"I bought this voice recorder because I wanted something that I could hook up to my computer. I didn't want to get an olympus because it was such a hassle to hook up to the computer if you don't have the drivers, which are very difficult to find on the internet. What I can say is that the Olympus VN 240 PC that I had borrowed from a friend is built much better than this one. This feels very light and cheap, while the olympus was much more durable and better quality. Also, there is no way to turn off this recorder except by removing the battery, otherwise the menu always stays on, which I'm sure will drain the battery by the time I actually want to use it. The only reason this recorder was worth the bother was because I got it on sale from oregonscientific.com for $29.99. DONT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS RECORDER. You are better off spending 60 or 70 bucks on something else."
4,Great product at a great price!,"Easy to plug in and use, call qualities are very clear, it even has a Skype Approved stamp on the packaging. If you need a cost effective solution to buying a headset for Skype or any other computer application, this product is your best bet."
5,perfect for gaming,"I needed a headset to use ventrillo to play video games. I have an expensive one that wraps around the back of my head, but it is very uncomfortable because I wear glasses. I like this one because it only covers one ear and you can wear it on either side if you suffer from the debilitating problem of ""hot ear"". It is very light weight and I never have any issues with it. A++ would buy again."
5,Excellent price,I really have not had much of a chance to test this product except when I purchased and it it was a great price for what I needed.
2,Labtec 341 mono headset,"Headset does not work as well as the Axis 301 from Labtec, that it replaced. Sound is somewhat scratchy."
1,mic wont work for recording,i got 2 of these headsets for an online spanish class for me and my brother and neither mic works when we try to record. no answer yet from sellers.
2,okay,"It was an okay mic but the headset is not very strong and mine broke after a little while.Sound quality wasn't that great either,I guess because there's only one headphone.I honestly wouldn't recommend it."
5,Nice Headset for the Price,Bought this for someone in the office I work with. She wants to do podcasting and it was a reasonable price for a quality item.
2,not useful for the traveler,"Really disapointed that the new software has no voice directionswhen driving MS streets & trips is worthless unless you have a co-pilot. On company trips I cannot use unless I stop every mile to get directions. Graphic are good, MS support are useless and never respond to email"
2,Sad end to a great series,"This declined from a 5 star to a 1 star. The plot - what there was of it - got more incoherent and nonsensical until the end made no sense AT ALL.I don't want to spoil too much, but apparenty CSIS has about 4 employees, the cops mainly try and keep American criminals from hurting Canadian criminals, and the average Vancouver crime gang could be scared off with a nerf gun.Also the CIA wants to make Canada merge with the USA. Like big pharma would let THAT happen - we'd get all their cheap drugs."
4,very disapointing,"i bought this game because of the name. i still think baseball stars for the nes is the best baseball game ever...this miniature version, however, isn't. the create a team and player modes are gone. the stat-tracking is gone. and having a baseball game on a small screen is very frustrating when you are trying to field the ball. the most frustrating aspect of it is having to wait for the screen to pan to whoever has the ball before you can do anything... and even then you can't throw the ball from the outfield all of the time. i kept playing this game over and over, thinking maybe i was doing something wrong, but i don't think i am. the games is just that bad! i do have to say one thing though... the batting part of it can be fun. a home-run derby feature would have been nice!"
3,"Mildly interesting story, but poorly told.",The story is very bizarre in a mildly interesting way but the writing style leaves much to be desired. It seems like it was written by a teenager that is trying too hard to be eccentric.
3,Not bad....if you can go through the whole book!,"I'll make it short.1st part was an okay story. That they fight the Old Ones with a bunch of thelepaths....humm...okay... why not... But it could have been better for having read all other books from Lumley, which I really like as one of my favorite authors with HP Lovecraft.The 2nd part...Aye! I'm not that into space pulp and time travel. 80% of the book is on time traveling in a clock. Didn't like that (and even less with that robot planet which made me think of STAR WARS R2D2..!). But once Titus Crow was on foot and then when a story involving other characters where taking place, like in the Roman Era (very nice) or in Elysia, then it was a good read.At the end, closing the book... I want to know more so I will go on and read book #2. I would give it 3 1/2 stars.If you like Lumley, give it a try... you might like it."
1,You've got to be kidding me!?!?!,"By using an A/C Adapter with ANY type of hand-held system, you are virtually taking the word ""portable"" out of ""portable video gamimg systems"" such as Neo Geo Pocket Color, Game Boy Advance, etc. In this day and age, who in the world wants to be connected to an wall-socket while playing video games? Or, worse than that, plug this A/C Adapter into an extension cord, then plug the extension cord to the wall outlet ... what a mess! You're better off spending your money on any of the new-wave ""high-tech"" batteries on the market today, such as Duracell's ""Ultra"" or Energizer's ""E2 Titanium"", both proven to last longer in high-tech devices. Better yet, go purchase the ""3-in-1 Worm Light"" for Neo Geo Pocket Color...which includes a re-chargeable battery pack w/charger."
2,Quality has gone downhill,I bought one of these years ago and have had no problems. However I just bought another one and the safety latch didn't work right out of the packaging. It would keep opening under the spring's pressure. I noticed that the quality of the plastic seems lower than the older pair that I had. I'm not sure if that's the reason for the defective latching mechanism.
1,Are you kidding me????,"you want $38 for this toy? They retail for about 13 to 14 dollars, it is such a rip off, Amazon should not allow this and I am a good customer who has spent thousands of dollars on Amazon.com and I am about to throw in the towel....these toys are the best but this price is absurd!"
5,Cool car you should buy it.,"Very cute car, durable as well. My three year old drops it , unfortunately throws it as well. It has gone down stairs, and even was put in the dogs water bowl. It still works fine and we are still on the first set of batteries. Very cute A+"
4,Jade,This one pretty lady . It is completely understandable the way she has gone to survive her marriage.It reminds one of sleeping with the enemy. The plot was great.
3,Great Trash!,"These films are not great by any means. They are not excellent thrillers, they are not free from cliches, they are not good movies, but that doesn't mean they can't be enjoyable. Enjoying trash has a validation for great films and even good films. But what these two films are entertaining in their way. Though Jade is accredited with fall of David Caruso's acting career and reduced him to CSI: Miami. And Bless the Child did nothing for Kim Bassingers career. Jade was written by pulp writer Joe Eszterhas and Bless the Child was written by three writers one of which was probably more known and stays better known for his television writing. For the low price that Amazon is offering these two movies, the offer is wonderful, and you shouldn't hesitate in grabbing them up.But, because the movies aren't great, I couldn't bring myself to give the films five stars. However, the price is definitely a five star price for what you get. You can enjoy these products, and have fun with them."
4,Spoof on teen help books--good reading for Middle Schoolers.,"This is a good book for the Middle School set to read. It's about a girl named Franny Dillman who creates an interesting life based on teen problem books that her mother brings home for her. Franny's mother is concerned about Franny reading ""adult"" books in her closet by flashlight such as Jane Eyre. Franny feels as though she has a boring, tranquil life so to shake it up and make things more interesting, she imagines her life along the books she reads. She makes her life parallel to the plots and the people she goes to school with into characters out of Jane Eyre.Her mother, wanting to help Franny adjust properly with the real world and her imagination gives her teen appropriate books that just make matters worse, but the situations are hilarious!"
3,No click when tightened,"This cap fits my 2002 Mercury Sable but it doesn't ""click"" when it is tightened all the way. It even says on it to tighten until it clicks. Not sure if it is defective or what."
2,"Works, but...",A strap to hold it to the filler tube should be included. I'm afraid I'm going to leave it at the gas station.
1,A huge disapointment,I had never heard of the 'International Symphony Orchestra' before and now I know why ! This extremely poor quality CD was a huge disapointment. Listening to a poorly composed and even worse performed disko-like version of John Williams's Star Wars theme was painstaking. This CD was definately not worth it.
2,Poor remix of popular sound tracks,"I was definitely disappointed with their renditions of popular theme songs. They are not even close to the original version. If you are looking for clasic sound tracks, stay away from this CD. If you don't mind them modified, then you'll enjoy a couple of the tracks."
1,Very Poor Quality,"The CD player gave out within a month of use. I bought this product because it was so cheap...I got what I paid for.In short, don't buy this product."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!,"This thing is a piece of crap, the cd player doesn't work right and the speakers suck. STAY AWAY"
1,Wont crimp with compression tool?,I have been crimping F connectors for probably close to 30 years and have never seen this before. I have the correct compression tool and these things are so stiff you cannot crimp them. Waste of money!
3,"Instrumental design techniques, sqaulid prose...","What this book is: a large collection of exciting and dynamic projects, virtually a must-have resource for its striking and dynamic style of presentation. Jones presents a full exploration of what may be termed 'machine-design', and his examples are wonderful specimens of craftsmanship.Of course, with so many architects, his complete presentation is overloaded with visual goodies, i.e., ""eye-candy"". One wishes he's spent more time in making his verbal presentation more lucid. The text is confusing, jumbled, and affectatious. It may be fashionable to speak about architecture in lofty, disjointed metaphors, but instrumentally helpful it is not. It is ironic that with such a cut-and-dried, what-you-see-is-what-you-get approach to the design of buildings, Jones has chosen render his thoughts so murky.It is, nonetheless, a wonder to peruse: the honesty of utilitarian pieces and the import of machine-design strategies is a marvelous gift to architecture."
4,Important Exploratory Architecture,"Since the early nineties, I've been an avid fan of Jones' architecture, using the tectonics of the machine as the driving force in his designs. The illustrations and models are extrordinary to look at and study and offer an adaquate summary of his career (although I wish he included more detailed accounts of his earlier works).Wes Jones' architecture may not be practical from the humanistic or economical point of view, but the machine architecture he practices continually evokes compelling examples and images which inspire me and other fans of design to search for innovation in our field.My only complaint about the monogram is his pretensious writing style which is difficult to follow - much of it pure 'train-of-thought' writing, it seems.If you find Jones to your liking, however, Neil Denari will be another architect you'll enjoy."
5,Style and Comfort - impressive,"I have always been a huge fan of Skechers shoes but was a little apprehensive buying it on Amazon. Surprisingly I realzied that shopping online for shoes is no longer a problem, thanks hugely to the sizing chart and numerous pictures of the shoe.The shipping was fast from Amazon and the item arrive well packaged.These are some of the lightest shoes I have ever worn with high level of comfort. Considering they are sneakers with no laces to tie makes them unique. The shoes are very cool/chic looking and as one reviewer already mentioned: there is a glue like thing around the shoes (brown in color) that could have been avoided in the design.Overall, I am very impressed with the shoes and highly recommend it."
2,Some good recipes but too few even for this series,"If you consider the target audience and the size of the book, it is OK and by no means intends to be an authority of the subject. Contains typical Greek recipes, some simple and some rather complex (such as the dolmades or spinach pie). Did not include my beloved Pastitsio either! An easy and delicious dish which would be great for kids to make.This is available in places as a PDF so look around and get yourself a bargain rather than the expensive hard copy book (I have the entire library of these books)."
2,Not original hits,"This cd may be the original artists as the cover says, but the songs are definitely not the original hits. It has a lot of great songs if you don't mind remakes. I prefer a cd with the original songs by the original artists. A big disappointment."
3,Not Sure.....,"Some of the songs on this CD, do NOT sound like the original recordings. Also, sounds a little TINNY to me. Nice to have all these songs on one (1) CD, but could have been a better quality recording."
1,"If you need a fax machine, don't get this.","It's a simple scam that these MFC things do: if you run out of any one of the color inks you can't receive a fax. Oh by the way, we never print or copy color on it. The color inks just dry up after a while and your fax machines just stop working. Now you have to replace the color inks just to receive a black and white fax. Did I mention, to completely replace the inks in this printer/fax/scanner/paper weight, it costs nearly as much as the fax machine itself?I seriously believe that the all-in-one machines are just a big scam in general. Save the land fill and buy only what you need, not what they say you might need."
5,awesome cobra lightbar,"excellant item, looks great on my bike. I found the instuctions easy to follow for installation. Had it installed and wired within a half an hour. I would highly recommend this item, especially at the price on this site, other sites wanted at least sixty dollars more for the same item."
4,Good Product,Good product overall. The instructions could use improvement. It helps if you have a working knowledge of electric wiring. Not as easy installation as the description stated. I had a friend who is knowledgable about motorcycles and electrical wiring mount the light bar. He had no problem.
5,Mister Underrated!!,"I had this collection on both cassette and vinyl,and in my opinion this was one of the best albums ever made by a male vocalist.It's a crying shame that it wasn't promoted the way it should have been.This album is the bomb.There are no fillers on this album,every song is a bonafide hit had it been properly promoted.As a matter of fact this album is very much responsible for my oldest child because it put my ex-wife and myself in the mood everytime we listened to it.Heart of Gold is one slammin' ballad.I sang this in a few talent shows myself and I recieved a lot of love for it.My other favorites off this album were You Turn Me Out and Still Waiting,but as I said the whole album is off the chain,and I am going to get my hands on it again despite that being a costly endeavor because it's well worth whatever I spend on it."
4,The best monitor I've worked with,"I'm an art director, almost crazy with color perfection. My G790 's been with me for five years. During this period, and thanks to its many color controls, I've managed to fine tune it as I never could another. And I'm talking about Sonys, Apples and one or another lesser brand.My G790 is sharp, with no out-of-focus areas, luminosity is very consistent. And I'm using its full viewable area.My system is a Mac, the video card an ATI Rage Orion, but I once had an iXMicro 128 connected to it. Doesn't matter, it had the same amazing image.Maybe I'm lucky to have been blessed with an exemplar one. But I'd rather pass it to Viewsonic. This brand captured me with this monitor. Give it a try if you're considering a new monitor."
2,Weak conclusion to a poor trilogy,"A group of nobodies goes through a series of adventures and then rises to the highest reaches of power - in other words, basically every other fantasy novel that typifies the worst of the genre. Such predictable tales, when well-written, are enjoyable, but this is just more of the same old, same old. Not recommended."
3,Best in the trilogy but still no masterpiece,"I read this trilogy ages ago when I was a kid and the fact that I remember so little shows that it was nothing special. Many others have said that the writing style is very ordinary and this is true in that it did not stand out at all. There was some interest in the plot, especially in this third book, because I remember that there was actually some organic action in terms of the resolution of the trilogy, as well as characterisation which seemed to have been better than the previous two books.If you are a Forgotten Realms fan (which I'm not, I was given the books) then the added interest of this as a background story as well as connections to the world of the Realms will probably outweight the negative aspects of the book such that it may be worth reading. Otherwise, it's fairly pointless to read the trilogy. If this book was stand-alone, it would have been quite good but the trilogy as a whole is less than spectacular."
3,Nice for beginners or younger readers,"An enjoyable, casual reading book. This book easily appeals to a wide variety of readers, but seems to be targetted to younger readers. I feel this book, and the whole series for that matter, was written in a fluent literary fasion with nice wording, but lacks maturity and often gets repetitve, dwelling in factors that no one wants to hear.On a positive note, the plot is very original and deserves praise for the thought that went into it. If you are a fan of dragonlance or any of the forgotten realms books, go out and buy this series. If you have a tendency to throw books out the window in frustration, or cringe at the thought of reading something you could have written in highschool, I would stray from this style of fantasy literature."
5,Fantasy Classic,"This book carried the perfect ending for the first three. And the later book Prince of Lies expands more into the ending of the avatar trilogy. This book and the other two books in the avatar trilogy are classic works of art, i was hooked by book one of the avatar trilogy and couldnt help but read the other two. A must read for all Forgotten Realms fans."
1,How Not To Build a Church!,"Jack Hyles' manual is nothing more than a manual of how to build a church his way. As a former student at his college, we students were constantly taught out of this manual, as if it were the Bible. The concepts that Hyles puts forth in this book and from his pulpit should make any normal person chringe. I would not recommend this book to anyone let alone a minister."
1,"How To Turn Church Into A Business, No Sweat","You'll love this book, if you think of church as a way to manipulate others' need for Christ into a business opportunity for yourself! There is little to recommend this book to a minister concerned with building people; much to recommend it for the man (or woman) who entered the ministry rather than some other, more physically difficult, way to earn a living. The potential buyer should carefully check into Hyles' scandal-ridden mininstry before purchasing this book."
4,Wonderful comedies!,"If you are a fan of comedies, you will certainly enjoy these three films.They are definitely some of my favorites."
3,A spirited farm girl joins the circus for a summer.,"Roxanne tastes life on the backlot when she joins the circus where her mother grew up. Under her grandmother's watchful eye, horse-loving young Roxie jumps from the Wardrobe department to a riding act of her very own. But a determined farm boy from back home wants her to leave the spotlight to become his wife. A pleasant romance/adventure set just as WWI breaks out in Europe, this novel has an unusually independent heroine for its era, and her choice at the book's end is refreshing. Also interesting in its depiction of the circus as filled with international acts and sophisticated talent, instead of the more usual bland stars and skulking bums working part-time behind the scenes."
4,Better than Game Boy,"Compared to NEOGEO Pocket Color, Game Boy Color is a fossil. If you compare the graphics on both systems, NEOGEO wins by far.The NEOGEO is a 16-bit CPU, and Game Boy is a 8-bit CPU.I got a NEOGEO for Christmas.It is silver with clear bottons and joystick.I have the game 'Bust-a-Move'. ITS GREAT!"
4,A great new system for the world to enjoy,"This video game system is great, and even though it isn't very noticeable right now, it will be a major competitor for the Game Boy Color system, and is very compareable. The two systems are the same size, only the Neo Geo Pocket is horizontal instead of vertical. The system also has a bigger screen with sharper and more colorful graphics. The joystick is a bit hard to use, but you will get used to it. The one major gripe I have with this system is the fact that there aren't really any standout games right now. I do like the fighting games and I have Neo Turf Masters, Sonic Pocket Adventures, and Dark Arms: Beast Buster 1999 which are all good games, but they aren't very noticeable. Still, I'd buy this system and make these games noticeable, because the games and system deserve it."
4,Neo Geo is amazing,"The Neo Geo Pocket Colour is an amazing hand-held console and is a huge step above anything the game boy can produce. Playing it is very like playing a SEGA Megadrive, which is amazing as this thing fits perfgectly in your pocket. It is smaller than you think. All colours are brilliant, images are crystal clear. There really isn't much bad to say about this. It is a brilliant price and with games such as Sonic Pocket Adventure this console has a right to be succesful. You should help make that happen by buying today."
4,Best small games machine,I bought a neo geo pocket for for my 6 yr old son But have notbeen able to put it down myself It is a much better games machine thanthe other Machine made by Nintendo (my daughter had one in june) well done!
5,snk neo geo pocket color concsole,"I just love this thing. I think that game boy color cannot compare to Neo Geo color, because its smaller, better graphics, and it can play up to 40 hrs! I just love it. theres no better portable gameplay than neo geo color!"
1,Beware of fake reviews!,"I believe that most of the reviews for this product are phoney. If you look closely, many of the reviews from different ""gamers"" have a quality to the writing that seems very phoney. Like some ad exec. is trying to write like a teenager, but not doing a very good job. Many of the reviews slam Gameboy, and tout the the up and coming popularity of this product. AND, all of them mention ""40 Hours on 2 double A batteries,"" undoubtedly a good thing in portable gaming, but rings false when it is in almost every review. I think this company is trying to launch a false wave of good reviews in order to push their product. Also there's like 150 reviews which is very high for any product on Amazon.com. This may be a good product, but I would be careful buying it based on what may very well be biased feedback."
3,???????????????????,Ive never heard of this system. I never saw it in stores or anything. How have people heard of this???
4,A Great System,"I have 10 games and they are all good. there may not be many games for this system yet but I can happily say that there is not one Bad game on this system.for some strange reason snk won't release any game that plays like garbage, i guess unlike nintendo they have quality control..BUY IT NOW!"
4,Not as great as expected,"I did not find the system to be as good as the hype. The first thing I didn't like was how the actual screen is only part of the black area which is a little annoying. Next the graphics didn't seem too stunning on a few games like Samurai Showdown 2. The control however magnificent it is, doesn't make that much of a difference. You can even get an add-on for the game boy color so it has a gamepad like the NGPC(the NGPC still has a better one though). Overall it is an ok system. Maybe a few more commercial games, better customer service from snk, and more support from the USA would make this system a better buy. I recommend getting the sonic bundle which includes the new sonic game and the NGPC if you really want to buy this system."
5,Questions from an interested buyer,"The Neogeo Pocket Color in Ocean Blue looks like a great hand-held system. I always thought about getting one, but never got around to do it.Does this Neogeo Pocket Color console in Ocean Blue really comes with six games? If so, which ones are they? Please, write back, somebody."
4,Neo Geo Pocket Color is the best,"the neo geo pocket is an awesome portable game system. i just bought one not to long ago and so far i have bought two games. Metal Slug is great, its just like the one on the arcade. they have the tanks and everything. king of fighters r2 is pretty good too. you have so many characters and you can earn new characters also. theres the mode when u can earn new things such as guns, armor , and many other things. as i said earlier this console is the best. if your looking for a good hand-held game system you just found it..."
4,Very good.,"Just a warning, I'm not an expert on tea and this is the first loose leaf tea I've tried. The biggest difference I noticed with this tea compared to bagged is the body. The body was full and silky smooth. The flavors were pretty subtle. I thought that the black tea dominated and the chai spices were there but in the background. Compared to say a Tazo chai which is in your face, this tea is there but you really have to pay attention and dig for the flavors.If all loose leaf teas have this much body, I'll be drinking more tea in the future!"
4,Great Tea!,"I am a beginner with tea, having been a coffee-drinker for 50 years. Among all the teas--and I have tried many in my initial tea-tasting phase--I count Ineeka Whole Leaf Organic Tea among my top 3 favorites. One unique thing about this tea is the way it comes packaged, each container having pop-out paper sides that fit the tea over the cup so you can pour directly over the leaves. it's as if each container is its own diffuser."
2,Music good but CD skips,"The music on the cd is just what I expected and I enjoy it. However, the cd is defective and skips."
2,Better books exist on the subject,"As a chief steward on private yachts, I'm always on the lookout for good books on napkin folding. Unfortunately, this isn't really one of them. There are some good folds but, the instructions are difficult to decipher. Of the 44 different folds offered, I've used about two."
2,Other books offer more ideas,"Hmmm. Other, similar books offer up to 94 easy folds, so this may leave you feeling short-changed. Only buy if you know you're unlikely to need more than 50 types of fold."
1,Returned original and replacement - neither worked,"Tried 2 units on Windows XP Pro system. Both had tremendous noise at both low end (rumble) and high end (whine). Driver required immediate update for WinXP installation and still was not Microsoft Certified. Software changes channels randomly at times and keeps going back to channel 1. Remote is a pain. Contact with Customer Support could not resolve software issues. For $70, I was willing to deal with all this, but then software stopped working altoghther and I am returning both the original unit and the replacement."
3,Not so good product,"I returned this product because the package was not complete. And when I tried it on my computer, the picture was not clear at all. I was quite disappointed."
4,Does It Really Work?,"I purchased one from Amazon.com and it took me close to 40 minutes to figure how to get it up and running. Not exactly user friendly. It had 3 serial numbers -- the software uses it own serial number off the CD and not the unit serial number as was expected. It took three tries to install in XP with the first attempt telling me it could only install in SP1 and not SP3 as was in my laptop. Fortunately, I had a Haugepauge TV Card before and knew how to work through the XP Window issues. It worked as advertised once it was installed correctly. The unit does get very HOT when operating so don't place on painted surfaces or anything flameable. It's small size is neat and makes for a mobile TV with the laptop. Now if only they had a mobile antenna..."
1,Software Doesn't Work with my new Dell XPS media center edition,"Unfortunately, this nice packaged piece of hardware is useless as the operating software will not load on my computer. Others online have had similar problems. Customer service and FAQ's unable to fix the problem. Beware..."
1,Don't buy it,"It indeed does not work as expected. I can't say too much, because after 1 month I still didn't manage to use it -- and I'm an expert computer user.Besides, it is much bigger than advertised. They show a photo of a credit card to give the user an idea of its size, but in fact the device is much larger."
1,dont but this product,"Bad Bad Bad software, says it captures to mpeg4 it will not, remote will not work, a/v out of sync when rec, documentation is 1 piece of paper. If you doubt me find the msg boards on msi and check for your self save your cash and buy somthing else."
5,A powerful first novel,"What a vivid account of life during a time when the general public knew little about eating disorders and abusive relationships! It makes me feel much more sympathetic towards people whose behavior appears strange. While it describes complex family and social environments with strong religious overtones, this book is also a gripping story - hard to put down and with a great mixture of humor, emotion and drama. A wonderful first novel - I'm looking forward to No.2!"
2,Arrived broken...twice.,"The platter is larger than expected and seems to be made of fine glass, HOWEVER, after two attempts to recieve platter intact, I gave up, because both platters arrived with the round glass ball 'feet' broken off. They need to figure out how to construct and/or package this platter so the balls stay affixed to the platter."
3,good yet bad,"when i came across this movie, i could not wait to see it.i patiently waited two months and finally bought it.boy was i upset!!the movie starts nice and simple, soon you get into it and begin to cope with the characters, then, at the end you are left with a bitter sweet feeling.i would watch this movie only if i were in a depressing mood!"
1,Terrible Movie,"This movie sucks. After watching it, I threw it in the trash. I don't even want to have it in my home. The acting and the storyline are as lame as it could get, and it did. And that's a shame because it could have been so much more. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE."
4,immense desolation,"As an expatriate Sandgroper, this narrative was quite entrancing. The authors have clearly spent much time traipsing through the vast areas of Western Australia. Arguably, they have seen more of it than many of its locals, who tend to be congegated in the Perth metropolitan area. Thus, somewhat ironically, a ready audience for this book might be people in Perth that wish to get out and see more of Australia's largest state.Overseas visitors should be cautioned about the book. Even though it does give the size of WA, the sheer immensity and dearth of people may still be surprising. Twice the size of Alaska, and with scarcely 2 million people. Well over half of which are in Perth. The book strives to convey the feeling of desolation once you leave Perth, and you should do well to keep that in mind."
1,Lack of Publication Date,The lack of a publication date on the amazon site makes it difficult to know what year the book was published.
3,Something to kill the time,"This was the first book that I have read by Philip Kerr. The book had a pretty interesting story line, but the writing was sub-par. His use of words didn't reach out and grab you. The suspense was their minus the imagery of necessary to be a good book."
3,Very educational.,"The story was for the most part very interesting. Some of it seemed very far fecthed. Philip Kerr did an extrodinary job of research for this book. Learned alot about mountain climbing and the like. The characters were a bit boring. You had the beautiful brainey scholar, and the brawney rough neck tough mountain climber, their names were Stella Swift and Jack Furness. Almost like a soap opera."
3,"Fantastic thriller, but lacks realism... impossible lucks..","Very thrilling, but needs more characterizations as well as REALISM... Story line is just a typical action made-for-movies type..."
2,Not a Thriller,"The book jacket contains wide acclaim for Esau. While the book is a good read, even a non-scientist like myself can see through the thinly veiled ""scientific"" descriptions of the novel. The plot is very loose and choppy. Incidents happen too obviously -- e.g., a mountian climber breaks into the National Geographic Building by climbing a sheer wall through an open window, a dead mountaineer from earlier in the story is found in a crevasse discovered by accident. The conversation is canned and the ""thriller"" aspects are sometimes interesting but not thrilling.Comparisons are made between Kerr and Michael Crichton on the book jacket. Actually, the novel seems closer to Jules Verne style knock off with the same interesting but now dated material -- think Journey to the Center of the Earth updated to the 1980s (yes, 1980s)."
4,Enjoyable read,"If you're into ""fictional anthropology"" (which I am) you'll enjoy this book. I'd have preferred it if Mr Kerr had left out the secondary political plot, but I suppose ""conflict"" (if you can call it that) sells. The mountain climbing factoids scattered throughout the book were very interesting and certainly made me think twice about trying it myself! Enjoy."
2,"Read once, then throw away.","The story is rather fun--a search for Yeti on a forbidden mountain...but the characters and situations are very trite, and set-up. I believe the author had dollar signs in his eyes while writing this, with the idea of selling it as a movie. For instance, the token black character is a dead ringer for one of James Earl Jones' usual typecast roles, and the author even described him as having a ""voice like Darth Vader."" When the author of a book is already casting for the film version, I doubt his motives. The token brainy female character is a college professor who talks dirty to her students. Gag me with a film reel. The author should try selling screenplays direct to the studios, rather than trying to write the novellization first and hoping Spielberg notices..."
2,Terrible Disappointment,"As I was reading this novel, I looked at the jacket several times to verify that it was actually written by Philip Kerr. This certainly isn't close to what one would expect of such a fine author. The characters are one dimensional, the dialog silly, and the plot ludicrous. Characters act in ways that simply make no sense at all and the story itself is ridiculous. A very disappointing effort by Mr. Kerr and hopefully just one of those misfires every writer produces once in a while."
2,disappointing,"This book was a tough slog. The first half of the book dragged and I wondered why it had been touted as a thriller. The second half of the book improved once the yetis were introduced, but it still failed to take full advantage of the storyline. There seemed to be too many characters and the subplot didn't really contribute to the excitement as I think was intended. Instead, it drew away from the main interest of the story, which was, in my opinion, the yeti. In all, the book was very disappointing and could have been much better."
5,Captivating,I love the stories behind the Yeti more than Bigfoot because there seems to be a greater possibility that this human exists. Kerr brings this possibility closer to reality. A thrilling adventure into the highest mountain range in the world.
2,Exciting premise falls to a poor ending,"As always, Kerr has done an incredible amount of research for writing a book. The science and political backgrounds presented here make the story very realistic even for those who find the idea of a Yeti far-fetched. Unlike some of his other books, the technical rarely impedes the flow of this story.However, endings are Kerr's weakness and this book is no exception. We are introduced to two fascinating Yeti characters who are the stars of the story and yet Kerr has them walk out of the story never to be heard from again, and this is significantly before the end of the book.The ending itself is very contrived and convenient and is of a much lower quality than the rest of the book. This seems to be Kerr's unfortunate hallmark, and it is really too bad.In sum, I can't recommend this book despite the promise it holds. No one likes a let down after hundreds of pages."
1,"Yes, it's a ""thriller"" but technically terrible.","One star only because there's no ""zero stars"" option. As a requent traveller and climber, both in Yosemite and in Nepal, I was aghast at the inaccuracies which had absolutely no bearing on the story except to aggravate a knowledgeable reader. THE El Cap, in Yosemite? The Lammergeier a ""small bird?"" A Sherpa named Harke Gurung? Sahween? Changabang another name for K2? Khatmandu? I suggest that those familiar with climbing and with Nepal save their money."
2,"Good concept, poor execution","The premise of this book -- finding a genetic ""link"" between man and apes on a remote and dangerous mountainous region -- is fantastic and compelling. However, the characters in this story are disappointingly two dimensional. Occasionally, the plot took a few unrealistic turns that, although readable, did nothing to do justice to the book's premise. Worth a read, but buy it second-hand."
1,Better to read the book yourself.,"I may have enjoyed the story if it had not been dramatised in such an extreme fashion. Should the words themselves not create excitement, drama etc.? Well with this audio rendition I will never know."
1,A lousy best-seller by a writer who usually is vastly better,"No basic aspect of the science in this book is right, altho Kerr captures some misc. details from Roger Lewin's book *Bones of Contention.* All sorts of specific ""real"" touches make it all the more frustrating that Kerr shows no understanding of how academia works, how grants, fieldwork and labs operate, or how evolutionary theory operates. I'd guess that after several brilliant books such as his ""Berlin Trilogy"" with anemic sales, Ker decided to churn out a potboiler which would pay off big-time. Let's hope this book finances a decade or two of outstanding books and does not scare educated readers away from Kerr's other books!"
2,Sophomoric characters but good adventure,"ESAU begins with the death of Jack's climbing partner but does Jack show any grief? Hell no, he watches what happens with curiosity. Later on, he drinks too much. The love story between Jack and his lover is equally devoid of convincing emotion. Kerr knows how to build plot and suspence - which is no mean feat in itself, but oh his characters are so stick like, the violence is gratuitous - come on, the CIA guy is psychotic?, and there is no subtlity of human interaction or realistic emotions. It reads like a Chinese meal; half an hour later, you're hungry for substance."
2,"I shoudn't have read ""Neanderthal"" right before this one.","For the first 180 pages, I couldn't put it down. Then it just got to dragging along. I read John Darnton's ""Neanderthal"" (a great read by the way), right before this one and after a while, I felt like I was reading it again. If I'd of continued on with it, perhaps I'd of liked it a little better, but I doubt it. It just couldn't hold my interest."
3,Two-thirds of a good book,"For the first two-thirds, I thought someone had actually written a good book on the yeti: well-paced, intriguing, and making good use of the sparse data available to create a believable picture of this alleged mystery animal. Then it fell apart with two unbelievable events in a row. First, there was the local holy man talking to the yeti and having it follow his orders. There's no evidence that the yeti could be smart enough to follow complex directions, and certainly no reason it would want to. The other howler is the parallel search for a downed satellite. When a satellite re-enters, you do not get a nearly-complete pile of wreckage: you get some bits of burned metal maybe the size of cornflakes. I was genuinely saddened to have a promising book come to such a ridiculous end."
2,As bad as a cow chewing frozen grass on a wintery eventing,"Three words-- endless, meaningless metaphors. Come on, enough is enough. An example, ""the icycles fell from the mountain onto his face like a thousand white lemmings jumping and dropping to their imminent doom, screaming as they fell"" or something like that. Cheesy! There was so much drivel that I just couldn't take it anymore. The man writes in cliche's. Compare him to Crichton? Heresy."
2,Not so hot on the Callaway HX Hot 35-pack,Pro: Shipping was free because I am a prime member.Cons: Several looked old. A couple have scrapes and a few have stains.They can only pass for a B-Grade and I thought I was buying A-Grade.
4,excellent quality,This is my second purchase of these balls. They are of excellent quality and I have never found a better price anywhere. My wife plays these balls exclusively and she is very picky about the golf balls she hits. She says that these balls are exactly the same quality as the factory new ones that cost much more. We will definitely order more in the future.
3,not impressed.,"Looked great but started noticing that some of played horrible off the tee. Honestly was losing like 40 yards, as if they were water logged or something. Some are okay, just unable to tell until you hit them unfortunately."
2,Not EXACTLY what I had imagined...,"Once I re-read the product page after I had received these golf balls, I did the age-old ""head-smack"" and called myself a few names that weren't exactly PG-13... So don't do what I did and expect halfway decent golf balls... These are not it. They are not in good shape at all. They were probably yanked out of some woods somewhere and not so much as even washed before thrown in a box and sent to my door. Completely my fault; however, disappointed nonetheless. Just buy a box of new Warbirds, you'll be way happier."
4,Not One HX Hot Ball included,I received 36 HX Diablo Tour. All are in nearly new condition. A couple look to have been hit once. There are no printed logos on any of the balls. Four stars for misleading product title.
3,Recycled golf balls,"Some of the golf balls are ok, some feel like you are hitting a rock. I use them on holes where I think I might have a chance of losing the ball! (I just started golfing last year)"
4,Good value,"I received a good selection of balls, most in very good shape. A few of them had logos, but most did not. But for the cost of approximately $8 per dozen, this was a great value, especially for someone who loses golf balls in the woods."
4,great value,"I am not good enough to warrant $30 per dozen golf balls; but I do like Callaways. for this price, it seemed worth it and I have to say, they look good. ALL BRANDED, ALL IN GOOD SHAPE, NO SCUFFS OR SCRATCHES. a COUPLE OF ODD LOGOS AND A COUPLE WITH MARKERS, BUT WHAT THE heck, they work, and the price was fantastic! I don't think I will buy ""new"" golf balls ever again!"
2,HX Hot AND Hot Plus,"Did not have the problem others have noted of different brands in this lot, but there were 3 different versions of the HX Hot in mine. I got about half of the HX Hots that I ordered (that had 2 different looks, no biggie), but also receive about half of them as the HX Hot Plus which is a softer ball. Not to pleased about that, but happy with a good deal on these balls."
4,Good Value On Used Callaway Balls But ...,"The golf balls arrived in a plastic egg-like carton. They were all in excellent condition. However, on closer inspection, 4 of the 36 balls were a different Callaway model than HX Hot. They included 4 CX3 Hot models, which are a much cheaper (and under-performing) model which can be purchased new at discount stores such as WalMart very imexpensively. So all in all, it's still a great buy, but be aware that you may not receive a full count of the balls you expected to receive."
2,Not what I thought,"Do not order the product if you are expecting these balls to be ink or marker free. Received a set of 72 golf balls and at least 1/5 of them had markings all over the place. I know when you order recycled golf balls that you get some scuffs or discoloration, but I did not expect to find everyone's ball line up or individual demarcation. Little disappointed, how the person who is getting them as a gift is more thrilled than I am. Just wish the product details were a bit more specific on what you would be receiving. I expected logo-ed golf balls from specific events and vendors, but not this."
5,"As described, great deal","Unlike some of the other reviewers, I received my balls today and I'm happy to report that they are in excellent shape. All of them are the same style (Callaway HX Hot), and 32 of the 36 are ""A"" quality. The remaining 4 balls I would rate a B or B+, only due to a very minor scuff or two. I am very happy with my purchase."
4,Boss MR-30 Marine speakers,"Just what I needed for the space available.Also, Amazon had a complete view of the product so it was easy to see the speakers not just from the front."
4,"A good idea, but...","I tend to be pretty clumsy, so i thought the neck strap would be a good idea. It is very sturdy,(at the widest point, 1-1.5 inches), once around your neck it's not going anywhere. The only problem I have is that it's too short. It seemed long enough when I got it out of the box, but when it's on, the game is only 8-10 inches away from your face. It's not so bad that I would return it, but I was a little surprised. Overall, I don't always use the strap, but when I do I'm not worried about dropping my Neo."
3,not a workout for me!,I am 39 and have been doing the Firm since I was 18.The Firm Basic Series is a good idea for shorter workouts. But this is just not for me. I don't even break a sweat....
1,Waste of time and $$$,"Ok, the intructor stinks, she loses count of reps, is never in synch with the music and she just doesnt motivate me at all. The workout itself is SO easy and the cardio section doesnt work you into a sweat at all. Dont even bother."
3,"I love The Firm, but this tape has some problems","While I love The Firm, and the exercises are extremely effective, this particular tape has three problems. The instructor doesn't give ample warning of position changes, she loses count of reps and worst of all in the low impact aerobic section she is not in time to the music. All in all the exercises work fine, but those three drawbacks make it a bit jerky trying to keep with her. You have to ignore her timing completely in the aerobic section and watch the other exercisers on the tape (who are also ignoring her and working in time to the music) This is the only tape I've seen her have these problems on. Your best bet is to rent it first before you buy to be sure these factors aren't as bothersome to you as they were to me. Tracie Long is the best Firm instructor and I recommend her workouts to any others."
2,"Disappointed, but still a Firm Believer","I consider myself an intermediate exerciser, but this tape I would recommend only for first-timers/beginners. For the reviewer from Canada who remarked the tape is over before you know it, that's because it is a rather short workout, and very easy. I hadn't even broken a sweat yet, and the instructor was already into the final stretch! The music is uninspiring, and the workout choppy, meaning you only do a few repetitions of one move before quickly moving onto the next, and so on.... This video I would skip, and spend your money more wisely on The Firm classic workout series."
4,Good overview,Good overview of memetics and an introduction to the debate over the viability of memetics as a science.
2,I hate this phone,"I hate this phone! I have had it replaced 3x because it has broken down. My srceen went out, there was a constant eco, and the sound went completely out. I have only had the phone for one year. Camera clearity is poor, and I used to like the way it opens but now its just anoying.Its cute but thats it."
1,nice look but useless,"initially i fell in love with the cool flip of the phone.but this phone has a tendency of breaking (same with my friend who had the same phone, and always happen to all motorola phones with the sound anyway), and i must emphasize that i have always been very careful with my own phones.- first the sound. all in a sudden the sound is gone, and the speaker has to be used if you actually want to hear what the other person across the phone is saying.- THEN! The charging wont work. Not the charger, but the actual phone cant charge.So then my phone is literally disabled.I spent another 25 in fixing the phone.I didnt use it though, just used my other because I really couldn't be bothered with it anymore.Then later when I decided to use it again, it worked for 1 more day, then the sound wont work again. I dont even know whether I should bother fixing it again.I highly recommend you not to buy it!"
4,Great Phone...but not the North American version,"I ordered this product from Amazon directly (not from a third party, although it appears amazon doesn't sell it anymore), and while they sent me a new, functional, phone like I had ordered, it is not the US version. The first hint was that when I opened the box the charger was the continental Europe-style charger (two round prongs). The second hint was that the spellings of some of the menus are in the Queens english (""Personalise"" for example). The phone is working fine with my US provider's SIM card (Cingular) and they did include an adapter for the charger, but it sticks out of the wall almost 5 inches now as a result. 4 Stars for the phone, but 2 for Amazon for not making it clear what I was getting."
4,PEBL Phone,"I recently bought this phone in preparation for some travel abroad. I'm now using it in Brazil, and have had no problems with it. It's compact, durable, and easy to use. I particularly like the magnetic closing action that makes it easy to open, close, and use one-handed."
1,TERRIBLE,"Phone arrived DOA, after company sent 2 replacement batteries phone still did not work. Sent replacement phone, worked for the first charge and now it's dead. If you plan on wearing the phone on a belt phone case, the phone will flip open on its own."
1,USED is not NEW,"I order this phone NEW from amazon. I actually can't say anything about the phone itself, because I didn't get to use it at all. First of all I ordered a NEW phone and the one I received was defenitely not new. It had all the plastic sheets on it, but it was udes before. So I returned it within 5 minutes of receiving it. I am very dissappointed with amazon. I don't think I'll order anything from them again.And the phone doesn't support the my faves plan from T-mobile. Well, just the graphics of the phone doesn't support it....so you may be able to call your faves for free, you just won't have the symbols on the screen....which is a big turn off for me."
1,Returned ASAP!,"Had the Motorola Razor and it got damaged so I decided to try this PEBL. With the Razor you can use a bluetooth ear piece and just push one button and say only the name of who you are calling. This feature I use all the time due to my hands being dirty at work. With this stupid PEBL you have to say all this junk like name dial or digit dial then finally the persons name. All these extra voice commands are not cool. The PEBL does not ever recognize what you are saying through your compatible earpiece and if it does then you are too irritated to talk to anyone. Then I dropped this phone only one time from out of a faulty case on my waist, wow! it sure dents and scratches easy! I will not be using Motorolas any more, I think they are bad for me."
2,I'm just doing it for the consumer,"I'm only wasting time on this review, because I felt like I had to. The cell looks great, but it doesn't works like it looks. The keypad marks on the screen as soon as you are in hot areas. The faceplate has awful quality and has bad signal."
2,overpriced,i got this phone because it looked nice and it does. but in terms of functionality and usability it is at the bottom of the list. motorola interface is very counter intuitive and it took a bloody long time to send one text message out. to top it off the pairing of bluetooth devices didn't work autmoatically. everytime i wanted to connect to my toyota prius i had to press about 6 buttons. i got tired of this and ended up selling my pebl. if you want a real phone get a k800i by sony.
2,AFTER TWO WEEKS PHONE BROKE,"i purchased the phone two week ago and all of sudden the phone is broken. I have yet to have dropped the phone, and it did not fall in water. the screen came in already broken and i just noticed it now..never again will i order from them because i have been ordering from amazon a really long time and this is the first time something has came into me messed up..10 thumbs DOWN!"
3,worth checking out,"Amazing that Musiq's latest debuts at #1 while Lathun's debut does zero business as the albums are remarkably similar in feel. Lathun wrote and produced most of this and it promises excellent things to come. As it is, some of the more laid-back numbers lack real personality with pedestrian arrangements but the more up-tempo tracks like Not Ready and Love Won't Let Me work really well. The undoubted highlight is the duet with India.Arie - When Love Came In. It swings!"
4,Easy Summer Read,A bright and open treatment of a serious subject. Full of first hand knowledge without becoming stilted. Populated with a host of interesting characters.
3,Silly story,A very silly story about a seagull that loves to eat-happens to be a family favorite from the 80s so I had to have it for my grandchildren.
4,The best handheld ever.,"Still playing that game-boy color? Well stop, take it to a video game store, and sell it, now, take the money, add a little bit of your own, and you have enought to buy the neo geo pocket. The neo geo is the best handheld ever. It has 2X the processing power of the gameboy. more than 5X the ram, and it can handle megabytes, not just megabits, it also has a mini-joystick that workes almost perfectly on fighting games of all kinds."
4,Already worth it after a few games.,"I own both a Game Boy Color and Neo Geo Pocket Color, and the NGPC gets *much* more use (yes, even though I played through Pokemon). Basically, the NGPC is worth it for Sonic, Card Fighters Clash, and SNK vs Capcom Match of the Millenium alone. Upcoming games like Megaman and Faselei, and current games like Metal Slug X, are like the icing on the cake. The system is pretty obviously more powerful than the Game Boy Color, one look at some of the great graphics (Sonic especially) will convince you. Also the thumb pad / joystick is VERY nice and comfortable to use, and the system feels better in the hands than thr GBC (your hands dont get as cramped) Do yourself a favor and grab this system (I fly alot, and wow do airline flights fly by now than I have this system. if only it had Tetris! But Shangahi is a good substitute)"
4,NGPC is Da Bomb!,"This is simply amzaing little system. It is superior in every way to the Game Goy Color. I strongly recomend buying this system. I also recomend some of the great games for it like Metal Slug 1st Mission, Metal Slug 2nd Mission, Gal's Fighters, SNK vs. Capcom, Fasili!, Dark Arms, Puyo Pop and the Upcoming Neo Geo Audio that will play MP3s! I was kinda nervous at first purchasing one, for fear it would'nt be good, but I went ahead and bought it and boy was I suprised! Get this now!"
5,Great Summary of Incan Architecture Through Experimental Archaeology,"This is an excellent example of experimental archaeology, especially in the attempts of the researchers to figure out both how the Incas moved several ton blocks, but also how they shaped them into interlocking walls for their architecture. The archaeologist on hand attempts to use hammer and pressure flaking techniques. The sweeping views of the mountains are beautiful. Later, people native to the area work to create a traditional rope bridge made of dried grass. Fascinating! This was required viewing for an archaeology class, but I brought it home and my 8 year old daughter watched it with me. We both couldn't get enough! It's a shame they didn't have time to talk more about the counting and record-keeping systems used by the Incas, but it did at least answer the question of how they did so without having a writing system."
1,deceptive advertising,"This is not about the secrets of the Incas. This is about a few good old boys who try to do what the Incans did. If you are looking for history, look elsewhere. If you like watching what Tanya did to Bob on a reality TV show, or that sort of thing, this is for you. Such a ridiculous waste of time and effort."
5,Exactly what I wanted!!!!,"I first saw these boots in a department store but they didn't have them in my size....I ordered them online and was so happy when they arrived!!!! The leather is such a beautiful color and soo soft!! The more you wear them, the better they look!!! My favorite thing about these boots is the almond shaped toe-it is way more comfortable than the pointy toe which has been popular for a while, and the heel provides great support without looking chunky. These are my new favorite boots!!"
2,"Hot Boots, Good Price, But they're Going Back....",I purchased these boots as a Christmas gift for my wife and she loved them. BUT...she could only look at them. Regardless of the fact that she is petite and wears a size 6 shoe- with no zipper or elasticity in these boots she had no way of getting into them. They're on their way back.
5,Love it!,"I wear this scent all the time and often get compliments about it. It is a clean, light scent. I first discovered it in Ireland and I was so glad that I found it on line. Shipped quickly. I would use the seller again."
3,"Reminds me of ""Coast"" and ""Irish Spring"" bar soaps","I was so excited to receive this Inis perfume, which I bought exclusively based on the rave reviews I saw here.Unfortunately, it isn't for me. It indeed smells very fresh and clean as other reviewers describe, however it's too heavily citrus for me and smells like a cross between the ""Coast"" and ""Irish Spring"" soaps marketed here in the U.S. Actually, I might prefer the smell of those as they are less citrus! The citrus note gets stronger the longer you have it on, too.I agree that the scent is androgenous, could definitely work for either a man or a woman. If anything, it's maybe more on the man side, but just a tad.Scent is a very individual thing, so reviews aren't the most reliable in this category. It may be the right scent for you, it just wasn't for me."
4,so fresh n so clean,"Inis has a very fresh/crisp/clean scent that I love. It's kind of a subtle scent and not overpowering, which is what I like about it. It's also very androgynous so a man or woman could wear it. Whenever I wear it people always sniff and make comments like ""what are you wearing?"" and ""mmm! you smell so good."""
5,Thrilled!,"Perfume came quick and was the highlight of my mums Xmas! She wears it everyday, and can't wait for the lotion to arrive"
4,Unisex,"Although this cologne/perfume met my expectations as a guy it didn't exactly do the same for my wife. Not to say she didn't love the cool, refreshing and clean smell of Inis but it sure wasn't womanly in any sense. I took a chance and went with it due to the ratings and what reviews I have read. Before you take the chance on purchasing this product just remember that it is unisex, for both male and female. This product does smell amazing in the aspect of difference but its something I'm sure that me and my wife will not purchase again. I love the smell of this fragrance and you won't be disappointed in purchasing this item, just remember that it's unisex. Nor girly or manly smell, just clean and refreshing."
5,Best scent ever,"Crisp clean smell, I always get compliments when I wear this .the scent lasts also. I use it with the lotion for layered effect"
5,Nice fragrance,I bought this because of the good reviews and I like it a lot. It is a very different than what I usually wear. Men or women can wear this.
5,Wonderful Perfume,"I was able to get this perfume in Ireland and it is very hard to find it in the states. Most perfumes make me sick and I get headaches, this one is very soft...just don't put A LOT on. It also changes depending on who wears it.Also I received it very quickly!"
3,Smells wonderful but not for me ..,Seller Celtic Croft is amazing. Received my package within 48 hours!Inis smells wonderful however it is not for me. While it is listed as Unisex I think that the smell is slightly more masculine than feminine- all of the women in my family agreed. The scent reminds me of Nautica Voyage for Men.
2,Excellent,I first bought Inis cologne in Ireland in 2001 and have not used anything else since that time. I will go to great lengths to find the cologne. I am very glad it is now being offered by Amazon.
5,excellent,"I bought my first bottle of Inis spray cologne in Ireland. When I came home, everyone loved the scent and asked where they could buy it. I ordered from Amazon and it was here in 2 days. Wonderful!"
3,"Wonderful, except it leaks!","Love this and the Body Wash. It has the best smell to it. I first purchased this in Ireland and fell in love with it! But, when I received the bottle in the mail, the box was soaked with the Cologne and now anytime it falls over, it leaks...and I have no idea where it leaks from. But, I love in nonetheless!"
1,broken,"I brought this for my office telephone and it was broken, light continuously blinked! Better off buying directly from Plantronics to ensure it works correctly."
2,Not what I expected,"What I was looking for was some type of ""On Air"" light. Although this does alert so, it has random light patterns that confuse the onlooker. If you don't mind something blinking at odd interval and are ok with explaining to every person what the light means, then go for it.Thanks!"
4,"Functionally works well, but my co-workers don't notice it.","Easy to use and set up, works reliably, but in my workplace people walk in and see me facing away from the door, don't notice the light and start talking to me while I'm on the headset. I'd like to see Plantronics come out with a brighter or larger LED version, but otherwise, it works as advertised... now about those darn co works that don't pay attention to it, I don't know how to fix that!"
4,Good indicator light if the bone heads at work would check it...,"It is a good product glad I bought it. Now, if I can get the bone heads at work to check to see if it is on before walking up talking to me."
5,Great Gift,Fast Delivery. Given to my daughter as a birthday gift and her and her friends had a great time with it. Recommend it to any one thinking of a tattoo.
2,Not happy,"This henna is not what i expected. After following all the steps exactly, the end results were less than perfect. The color was very light and it only lasted a few days not 3 weeks as promised. Not happy at all"
2,Not very useful,"Not very useful. The readings are all over for various materials. Many perfectly dry materials (like drywall and wood) give mid-range readings, in the yellow zone. It cannot be calibrated for correct readings with any given material, so you don't know if a high reading means moisture or is just normal for that material combination. You need to calibrate it against a known-dry piece of identical material(s), not always practical.The auto-off feature is ridiculous. It shuts off after 1, 2 or 3 minutes without regard to measurement. It will shut off while measuring. Even the cheapest tools I own are smart enough to shut off AFTER 1 minute of INACTIVITY. Unacceptable at this price point."
1,cheap,"This car charger doesnt even work on the SK2 pagers. Looks and feels cheap quality materials, I would advise not to buy it."
1,doesn't work after a week,"It worked fine when I first got it, and then about a week after I got it, it would only work if I held it into my phone a certain way, which was not only inconvenient, but it would make my hand cramp up... Eventually it just stopped working all together and its too late to return it. I would not buy this item again."
1,IT SUCKS!!,VERY CHEAP!! VERY USELESS!!!! IT DID NOTHING FROM THE FIRST TIME RECEIVING IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! VERY DISSATISFIED!!
2,Wish I'd avoided this one.,"Cassette section failed within first year. Tapes auto-reverse and auto-stop randomly. Tape counter inconsistent.It takes a looong time for CDs to be recognized.CD controls are insensitive. They need a good solid click to activate.CD audio plays through the tape outputs, as well as the CD outputs.Wish I'd avoided this one and bought separate units."
4,Teac recorder,Good for both CD and Cassette tapes with easy functions for those needing user friendly features. Sound is very good for cassettes.
2,TEAC AD500 Integrated CD/Cassette Deck,I have been looking for this type machine for a long time. I was disapointed. It broke down right away. Guess I am still looking.
4,Good Book,"I bought this book to help me with a presentation for a class I took in college. It has good information about a topic that is not widely discussed. I considered buying Freud's book, but this one seemed much more readable. I am happy with my purchase."
5,Overdue collection by Canada's best SF short-fiction writer,"There's no doubt who is the best Canadian writer of short science fiction: it's long been James Alan Gardner: Hugo finalist, Nebula finalist, Aurora winner, and Writers of the Future Grand Prize Winner. This collection was announced some time ago, and at last it's finally here -- and well worth the wait. All of Gardner's stories are excellent, but the standout in this volume is probably ""Three Hearings on the Existence of Snakes in the Human Bloodstream,"" which just totally kicks butt. Gardner is a brilliant stylist, a sly social commentator, and extremely witty in a clever, mordant Douglas Adams or Monty Python sort of way. Truly a wonderful collection; stands beside Ted Chiang's STORIES OF YOUR LIFE as one of the best single-author collections of the last decade."
3,Pretty good first collection: 3.5 stars,"I enjoyed most of these stories, but Gardner didn't seem to have quite enough first-rate stories to fill a book. ""Sense of Wonder"" (1999), a Bisson-style short-short, was my favorite. Quite a few dusty workshopped-to-death pieces -- though all were previously bought by someone. Amazing Stories, for many of the weaker ones. Caveat lector. YMMV, of course, and anyway I'm lukewarm about Gardner.Happy reading--Pete Tillman"
1,boring...boring...boring,the stories are not what you called good nor imaginative. do not waste your money.
5,"Excellent 12""","This is a really great 12"" skillet. As the name indicates, this is a deep-sided 12"", which renders the footprint a little smaller than other 12s I've used, but only by a half-centimeter or less in diameter. It's heavy (though not as heavy as the Analon pan it replaced), and when full the helper handle really comes in handy for moving it around. Heat conductivity is even and consistent. For the price I paid (it was 30% off) I'd say it was an acceptable buy, but at full price I'd call it a bit rich for most people's blood."
3,works but not very durable,I was able to successfully bake a pear tart in this pan but after one use I noticed that the bottom part was warped on one side (a little bent along the perimeter) and after two washes the hinge has already started to rust. Can't imagine I'll be using this pan much longer.
5,Great book,"These mammoth books are a great intro to certain subjects. although they arent really big theres a lot in there and its fun to feast your eyes on all the great pics . You can""t miss with this one or any of the mammoth books!!! Buy em love em !!"
4,great ideas.,"I bought this book a few years ago and it has been borrowed multiple times from some of my very artistic friends. They use the images as ideas for paintings. I bought it to make my parents think I was a nut when I first moved out. mission accoplished. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the female body, all types are represented in this book."
4,"Does the job, doubts about longevity","Got an identical set on eBay from the source in China for $25, free shipping.Pro: works! The receiver uses AAA batteries, easy to find.Con: not build to last. Using duck-tape to keep things together might not be a stretch in the future. The controller uses an odd size battery, maybe expensive to replace. The controller doesn't have a on/off switch. So I take the battery out when not in use.Look on eBay and it's not hard to find. I am not a seller or in anyway related to the seller(s)."
3,Poor Craftsmanship,"I gotta say that this product has been working ok so far. The only problem I have with it is that the craftsmanship isn't that great. It just feels cheap, like it's going to fall apart. That is the reason for the 3 stars, but then again, if you have a 30D like me there aren't any cheap alternatives."
1,Piece of trash,"i wasted my money, it work only some times and only a couple feet of distance, very dissapointed."
4,Terrific product,"Works just as described, long range, no problems. I set it up with my camera outside next to the bird feeder and started snapping away - got some great shots of birds taking off and landing. It comes with a battery which was dead upon arrival (hence the 4 stars - would have been 5), so I thought the product was not working. A new battery added like $12 to the price of the remote, but even so it is much cheaper than the Canon remote."
4,A great addition to any Kennedys/Jello fan's collection.,"While this book does not have really great information on the band, it does contain some rare and little-seen photos from the early eighties of the band members, their performances, and their artwork. This is an unauthorized book, and the back cover contains a word from the band telling the reader what they did and did not like about the book. It does not have any information on the band after 1983, so I feel it was written extremely prematurely.If you are a Dead Kennedys or Jello Biafra fan, you will almost certainly enjoy the pictues in the book and the little bit of accurate/interesting information about the band and their careers"
3,"Great Band, Mixed Review","Actually I give this five stars for being a unique glimpse at the early Dead Kennedys and the punk rock scene in the Bay Area (pictures of Jello's campaign and wedding alone are worth it, especially if you were around 11 when all of it was taking place). But the unauthorized business is just not right nor in keeping with punkgeist, and for that I have to give it one star. Averaged out, that's three stars. Thanks for the peek into early punk culture, though."
2,Brief,"I should have checked the fine print. This book is more like a picture/scrap book, not an indepth autobiography as such. Was disappointed additionally with the waffer thin size of this book. I should have listened to the DK and not brought it."
2,Alright book but...,"This book is not up to date niether is the scripts that are for download. ALSO and must importantly, there is no support for this book. I emailed the author and got no response. Not so great for beginners. Try another book."
2,Know nothing about PHP? Stay away of this book...,"At first sight, it looks a nice book and after you notice its hundreds of pages you may think ""I've found THE book to start learning PHP"". Nothing could be more wrong!! If you know nothing about PHP just stay away of this book. It's not well structured (you hardly find what you want by using the index), the author wastes paper with silly advices (not speaking about the first chapters which are really needless) and the examples all along the book don't work as an invitation to keep reading it... I bought it as a victim of a good marketing operation but now I sell it together with MySQL Bible on a good price to those who don't believe me."
5,Its a great book for PHP beginner,"Its a great book for PHP beginner like me, the explanations and the codes are clear to read and understand. However, the author is very helpful that she solve my problem through email. She is very helpful for me to catch on the PHP."
4,A Profound analysis of Argentine nationalism,"The book commences with a retrospective analysis -- thorough and complete -- of Argentina's history from viceroyalty to Peron. It traces the deep social roots of Spanish conquest and creole development within Argentine society. These concepts build upon one another in an outstanding work that explains Peron, his politics, his psychology, his return to the Casa Rosada from exile, and his country. There are too many historical/political characters for the first-time Latin American history reader, but definitely recommended to all interested in the region's past which somehow lingers on."
2,You Don't Need It,"The only part of this book I really found interesting was the authors' development of corresponding personality disorders with each of the types...Which I don't feel was adequately developed to be worth the buy. Basically you can see that they've managed to correspond types with personality disorders, but I think ""The Wisdom of the Enneagram"" is more informative in terms of using Enneagram information to stop negative patterns of behavior.Personality Types, The Wisdom of the Enneagram and Discovery Your Personality Type (the personality test) will compose a solid library for any Enneagram/Hudson Riso ethusiast."
5,To anyone on their quest to understand personalities,I'd recommend this for both someone who's new to the Enneagram and for those of you familiar with it - it will fit you both!! I simply love this book! It's practical and it's my favourite Enneagram-book so far because of this. There's growth recommendations for every type and the types are also described in depth and as an introduction.
5,First Amazon Experience,"I've written a few papers in college about Amazon.com and this purchasing experience backed my research about the company. Your customer management system is top notch, as is your product quality. I didn't buy new but the book I received can easily pass as unused. This has been a great first experience and I will definitely continue to use Amazon.com for future purchases. Thanks!"
5,"A ""Must Read"" for Educator or Business Executive","As I read Marshall's book, I found myself wishing that I had had this as required reading in graduate school! There is so much to discuss, from self-awareness (i.e. whoever asks the questions controls the conversation) to classroom management to parent education. As a faculty, we chose this book as our summer reading. Everyone...and I mean EVERYONE...(approx. 25 faculty members) felt this was one of our best picks yet...and we've read some awesome books over the years! In addition to faculty discussions, we hosted a parent session to have a conversation on the parenting chapter. By and large, the parents were so excited by the stimulating conversation, that they asked for ways in which they could integrate the concepts at home! Marshall's concepts and strategies have the best interest of the child in mind. Truly a win-win...for students, teachers and parents!"
5,"Very practical ideas in a reasonable, rational text","Discipline Without Stress, Punishments Or Rewards: How Teachers And Parents Promote Responsibility & Learning by education and child development specialist Marvin Marshall is a highly positive guide for teachers and parents seeking to helping young people learn without putting overwhelming pressure upon them in the process. Introducing a system to help parents foster accountability and positive life skills, chapters of Discipline Without Stress, Punishments Or Rewards set forth very practical ideas in a reasonable, rational text easily accessible to lay readers. Discipline Without Stress, Punishments Or Rewards is first rate and thoughtful book, highly recommended to teachers and parents of children at all grade levels from preschool through high school."
5,Pass it on...,"I love Marv's ideas. I pass them on to my students studying to be teachers at Cal Poly State University in San Luis Obispo, CA. I also pass them on to my MA candidates who are already successful teachers. He offers a wealth of ideas and puts a positive spin on that precious component of success -- attitude!"
1,Too Much Cat Nip,"This is a study in short attention spans. Jerry Lee meanders, banters, does everything BUT finish a song. I always have loved the Killa, but here he seems a little too stoned--or not stoned enough. However, if you like your doses of boogie woogie brilliance in nanoseconds, this is the disc for you. As an added bonus, you get the thrill of hearing tape being rewound."
4,"Great game, not very durable","My whole family loves this game (we call it washers), and I have given it as a gift many times. I just wish it was more durable. The box gets pretty dinged up, and we have had to super glue the cup in the middle after it comes off. But we've tried some other brands and this one seems to be the best. Because it's relatively cheap we just assume we will have to buy a new one every year/every other year or so."
3,"Great backyard fun, lacks durability.","I had my family over a few weekends ago, and we played the heck out of this game. It was a blast. However, after a heavy day of use, the bottoms became disconnected from the sides, and one of the plastic pipes broke off. I was actually able to repair all this stuff quite easily with some screws and small nails.The game is easily portable with the latches and handles. The coating on the washers makes them easy to find and seems to be pretty durable.."
3,Broke with first use,"I bought the Washers kit for a backyard BBQ we were throwing, and it was a crowd pleaser and great fun ... until both cups broke (became dislodged) from the boxes. Needless to say, the good times ended after that. It's a shame the quality of this product was so poor. I suggest saving the money and making your own."
1,Poorly Built,"This product is poorly built. The very first time we played with it, one of the plastic tubes broke off after being hit by a washer."
3,Broken on delivery,"The circle insert was not attached to thte box when we opened it. We have rescrewed the insert back into the base. We'll see. I didn't have time to resend it back (or incur the cost). Other than that, the purchase was smooth."
3,"Great game, poor quality","This game is loads of fun, but the construction is POOR! One of the pvc pipes broke off during the very first game! We glued it, hopefully, it will hold up. Look around, there are other games that have better construction."
1,Be Real This Movie Sucks,"Ki Toy Johnson Was in the movie for like 3 secs, she didnt get naked, when she started to dance she taken off the stage. I'm from ATl, GA and i've seen the same chicks they show nude in this film cant even get hired at an ATL strip club, even if they gave it up as easily as they did in the movie. But if the purpose of this film was to mislead Ki Toy fans into purchasing a KiToy film he did a good job, but she was not the star in the movie, her name was just in the credits. Also, this film CANNOT even compare to Ice Cube's Player's Club."
2,"MOVIE NEEDS WRITER, DIRECTOR, AND ACTORS","Women, for various reasons work at a gentleman's club in Atlanta that caters to primarily an African American audience. The owner of the club is being shook down by a police force detective, who desires one of the dancers. The movie contains nudity, but not enough to be called soft core. The movie contains acting, but not enough to call it cinema. F-bomb and hip-hop music. There is no real central plot."
1,Terrible,It was terrible. It was the worst independent film I've ever seen. The acting was horrible. I could have made a better movie myself. Don't buy it.
4,This movie reminded me so much of The Players Club.,"Even though I liked The Players Club, I'll have to admit that I like The Naked Truth better."
2,"a Poor Man's Player's club,but good eye candy","i wasn't feeling this Movie as a Actual Movie,but the Chicks were happening. it took alot off the Player's Club.much like that film,it wasn't about the acting but the visual. same thing here.good for watching,but it never gets into the next level.a decent low-Budget movie at best."
4,Pick n' Choose,"This book is a good source of various combinations. It is loaded with assembly details and tips on sources for high performance components that work. I'm going to build a proven combination the next time I build an engine. This book is a very enjoyable read and the results should prove very interesting. The selection runs the gamut in terms of size; 383, 406, 408, 427, 454, all small blocks!"
2,"YEP the tracking is not good, Microsoft wins this and by much.","Hi all,I have both, the V400 and the Microsoft 6000, the V400 has many problems, seems like the laser engine has many betas still to go, the tracking is awfull, constantly stopping and restarting, the precision also is too bad, is very difficult to give in the target with this mouse, more if you try with CAD applications, any person, even the basic PC user will notice the bad quality of the laser mechanism.Is true, is a nice looking mouse, i have many logitech products that are really good, from the presentation bluetooth mouse to the laser one, this V400 seems to break the line of quality logitech has always had.Kinda disappointing,I'm uploading pictures of my mouse (Logitech V400 orange), so if you want to have a mouse to look and show, the V400 could be a museum object, but if you want a extreme machine, the Microsoft 6000 is the one to go.GreetingsSergio Claver from Lima, PERU :)"
2,Something in this mouse is wrong !,"I have the same problem others reviewers write down here before me. A pitty I didn't listen them before.The accuracy is terrible awfull, many times, I move the mouse, and the pointer star to move erraticaly or doesn't move at all. No precision, and do just the contrary that the add says ""all terrain"". I have many friends that have the Microsoft mouse for notebook, and they no have problems where I have.The relatively good news, is that with time, if you play a little with the setUp, you reach an acceptable beahvior, but ... nothing compared to a normal old logitech mouse.Eduardo."
1,V400 is awkward to use,"I just purchased this mouse and have used it for 3 days now. It works well as a mouse, but it is very uncomfortable in my hand. Having to use your index finger for the forward & back buttons is awkward. It also doesn't fit your hand well. I would not recommend this unit. I am returning the V400. I originally had a Microsoft notebook mouse which works well and was comfortable to use; but I was specifically looking for a notebook mouse with forward & back buttons, the v400 seemed a good idea until actually using it... I'd love a smaller version of the MX1000.Note: the logitech software that comes in the package is an older vesrsion that does not allow the forward & back buttons to work with the Mozilla Firefox browser, you have to download a 47Mb update from the Logitech support site."
1,Worst laptop mouse ever?,"I purchased this mouse to replace my trusty Logitech V200 and have been nothing but disappointed. This mouse has serious tracking problems. It will track ok on a piece of paper, but if I use a mousepad, desktop, or surface of my laptop it consistently loses track of the cursor. As much as I would like to carry around a blank piece of paper to use with this mouse, this is NOT the reason why someone buys a laptop mouse that claims to have an ""All Terrain Laser""My advise, stay clear of this mouse. It is the worst optical mouse I have ever used in my life."
1,The worst mouse I have ever used.,"I had this mouse for half a year. I suffered from this mouse a lot :(. First of all, the battery won't last for a week if you keep mouse awake. I am using rechargeble battery (Sanyo Ni-MH 2100 mAh). I also have a microsoft mouse, even though it uses two battery instead of one as V400, the battery can support me for half a year. Second, the focus of V400 is not good. Sometimes you can see the cursor is shaking without any movement. These days, I found a new big problem. The mouse is frozen when windows xy starts up. I thought it was xp's problem, eventually I figured out it was my V400 mouse. I had a very good impression with logitech. But this time, I will double think when I buy anything from logitech."
1,WORST MOUSE EVER,"Horrible mouse! Incredible lack of precision, the cursor moves are inconsistent with the mouse move... It might look nice and it is compact but ... it will drive you insane if you need a bit of precision on the screen. Spent hours playing with the settings... in vain. I have changed the mouse pad several times, no difference ... Total waste of money, very unpleasant surprise from Logitech."
2,It is not great!,"I tried using this mouse for several days thinking that I would get used to it. I bought it because I liked the USB that snaps in- I tend to lose things easily. The extra buttons are a great feature. I also thought the laser would give me better accuracy. Well, I'm not a fan! The accuracy is not good compared to my cheapo logitech optical mouse. The tracking is awful. Plus, it is not very ergonomical, my wrist started hurting after only 30 minutes. I returned it!"
1,Waste of money,"All you get is a small plastic brain mold, some plaster of paris and some little thimbles of paint. The whole project lasted 4-minutes from start to finish (not including the overnight setup of the P of P). A real waste of money. We hoped it would have other projects and directed activities about the brain, but nothing. Buy ""Mind Blowing Science"" instead. My duaghter is always driving me crazy wanting to fo their projects! They are educational and fun. Avoid the Bulging Brain!"
3,Hack Job,"The critique of John Champagne's Ethics of Marginality in the introduction of this book is just plain shoddy and careerist. Munoz states that Champagne accuses Marlon Riggs' Tongues Untied of vilifying white people; in fact, Champagne's critique says the film vilifies gay, white, s/m culture. Munoz accuses Champagne of ignorance of Essex Hemphill's poetry--poetry Champagne himself discusses in the very same chapter in which he analyzes Tongues Untied. Apparently, Munoz is so interested in making a name for himself that he doesn't bother to read carefully the sources he cites. Perhaps Champagne's critique of the figure of the privileged marginal just hits too close to home for NYU's Munoz."
3,Interesting but vague,"I like this book but I have to say the author makes many vague references to individuals using nothing other than their name (Mr. Jones said.."") It left me wondering just who these people were and how reliable their info was. After reading it I did a little research on my own as he mentions a man named Polycarp who claimed that the Christ he knew lived to about 50 and died of natural causes. This is interesting because the Polycarp I read about was considered a saint and a early founder and supporter of the christain faith. Anyhoo, I still liked the book though the wording was odd. It is one of several I have read that simply reaffirms that the christian faith is a rip off of prior pagan and mythological beliefs."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this book at a time in my life when I was quite anti-Christian, but once I got into the book I found myself defending Christianity from an author who obviously hated the Christian faith and just wanted to discredit it. Some of the things said in this book are out right ridiculous. Also the title is a bit misleading sincee most of the book is about Christ and Krishna and their similarities. Yes the book does actually mention sixteen saviors but a few of them are a bit ...loose. I don't know when this book was written but the sentence structure is really awkward. That being said most of the actual fact stated are trtue as far as I can tell. In short, read it if you can, but don't pay money for it."
5,Very good read with alot of enlightenment.,Great! It was well worth the wait. A book that will be a value to my collection and will be read on numerous occasions.
3,Very enlightening.,"I've been longing to read a book like this and I'm really glad coming across this title. It is really very interesting, educating, full of information, historical and unknown facts. It is very enlightening and an eye opener. The book should be read objectively without taking into consideration one's religion or belief. It is a mature title that requires mature minds for a mature comprehension.In some chapters, the author tends to identify Jesus as the founder of Christianity and the Gospel writers as Christ's biographers. Such is not all that correct because Christ never founded any religion and He knows nothing of the so-called New Testament.This notwithstanding, this is a book anybody wanting to improve and widen his or her religious knowledge should read."
4,Square dance music,It is a good cd if you know the steps to square dancing. we didn't but had fun with it anyway.
5,So Fun!,These are so fun and easy to use. My 11 year old is eating her breakfast cereal with them. It is nice you can use even disposable chopsticks and it is easy to wash.
2,Confused!!,"I must offer a caveat at the beginning of this review as we have not actually used the chopsticks holder. Based on the photographs of this item I expected to receive two sets of holders for a boy and a girl. In fact I was apparently arbitrarily sent just the boy. It was not clear to me that this would be the case and had I known I would have requested the ""girl"" for my daughter.If this turns out to be a question of order fulfillment problems I will amend this review accordingly."
1,It's a piece of trash-- don't waste your money.,It doesn't work for Sidekick Color either. The connector is far too small and has too much play inside the SK's socket so you will get a charge indicator for a second then it goes away then back a while later-- all of which amounts to the device actually depleting the SK of power and not charging it. Don't bother buying it because you'll just throw it away as soon as it arrives.
4,Poster.,"Great customer service. Resend a second poster at no charge when first one was defective. I havn't received the 2nd poster yet, I assume it will have better packaging than the first. Good merchant!"
1,Shipping Oxysept instead,"Ordered a bottle; they sent me a bottle of ""Oxysept"", which is the replacement product. Given that I can get Oxysept anyplace, and paid the extra shipping specifically because I wanted Aosept instead, I'm kind of annoyed."
4,Great message!,"""As a grad student, there are times when I feel the pursuit of happiness is making me miserable, but I never quite realized why. Then I received Dr. Frank's book as a gift. His message rings loud and clear, ""whining is anger forced through a very small opening."" There many insights in this book for me, and I have purchased a few for my friends. Everyone can find at least one message in Dr. Frank's book that will help them attain their own level of Peak Performance."""
5,Love Gatorz,"I have three pairs of Gatorz (in different frames) and I love them. I bought a pair for personal use, a pair with the transition lenses as safety glasses for work and bought my wife a pair after she kept stealing my Gatorz (Radiator). Fantastic company with a great warranty/repair process. We sent my wives in to have th lenses changed to a different style ($49) and they came back pretty much brand new. After two years of use, I can give this product and company 5-stars. I too hate buying expensive sunglasses because of lense scratching and losing them, but these are worth it and if you damage them, you can have the lenses replaced for a very reasonable price. Check the website for all the different option. You can have your own sunglasses built, custom for the same price."
3,be careful please before attempting this workout,"what they should warn any woman about before buying this dvd is that you won't be able to use it until about 5 months after you give birth. i tried at 3 months and sprained my back. it's embarrassing to admit that after looking at the cover of this dvd because it looks like anyone can do it, but this dvd is hardcore. women still have the relaxin hormone from pregnancy that keeps our joints loose and has us thinking we can do more than we can, which is why a much more subtle workout and walking is more recommended than this. i will attempt this dvd again because the workout is great, but i will wait a couple months so that i don't get stuck another week on painkillers."
3,eh...,it didn't really get me sweating like i thought it would- like all the reviews said- it was good for toning but i was looking for more cardio too. i will go back to my denise austin.
2,disaappointed,"This is not a horrible dvd, but definitely not one I will use often. The ""boot camp"" theme is taken a little far, and somewhat cheesy in my opinion. In addition, the music - if you can call it that - is mainly just background noise to this instructor. She doesn't move to the beat of the music or count it. (I'm an aerobic instructor and this really gets on my nerves; some people may not mind it) If you like good music to get you in the mood for working out, don't buy this video! The overall workout is a good one, and I like the way you can customize your workout by using several different options."
4,"the most ""doable"" exercise DVD I have ever owned","I really like this DVD. It makes it SO easy to fit in exercise every other day. The 12 week program starts at a very appropriate level for new moms and slowly builds. I find this so much better than a DVD that is intimidatingly hard or long at first, or too easy. I know I will stick to the 12 week program because I look forward to doing it! It's so short that it doesn't matter that baby is not ""included."" You can easily squeeze it in during a nap or even just have him watch.I have one disclaimer: I would not recommend this DVD to beginning exercisers or brand new mothers (I started this DVD about 10 weeks after birth). It does not include enough information about alignment or safe technique. But if you are experienced and already know a thing or two- go for it!"
3,A little too corny,"I'm actually in the military and found this work out to be a little too corny. I wish she would have called it something else besides postnatal ""bootcamp."" Maybe she could have called it ""The Best Postnatal Workout"" or something. It's not a bad workout, just didn't mesh with my personality. I need something a little more intense to prepare for my job again like jogging, balance ball workouts, and weights. It's a great idea though!"
1,Music and scenery was sooo annoying,"I ordered this dvd after delivering my first child. I found the repetitive ""taps"" music annoying. In addition, the scenery of the video was so cheap. I could not get past the poor quality of this video. Also, the exercise scenes did not flow into one another...I had to keep forwarding it a little bit. I was not pleased at ALL!!!"
4,Great Workout,"Let me reiterate that I am the laziest human being to roam the earth...I got by because I have always been super thin naturally. I knew I needed to get in shape after my second child but I was hesitant to try a bunch of workouts because of my severe diastasis recti. I know Lindsay is one of the FEW trainers who addresses this issue. I look about 4 months pregnant despite being about 108 lbs and 5'3"".Anyway, this workout is hard but completely and totally doable. She makes it EASY. If you actually do it 3x a week like she recommends (I don't---I'm lazy), you will see results fast. Even with the occasional workout, you can tell this works.I gave it 4 stars but it probably deserves 4.5"
2,Disappointed,"I regularly exercise yoga, hiking, elliptical, walking and P90X. I exercised through my entire pregnancy and had a quick natural labor and birth. I waited the recommended amount of time to start working out and waited a couple extra weeks to start this video. I hated it. I went back to all the above listed workouts and hadn't had a problem but I thought I could use something specific to target the new mom problem areas. My jiggling belly and new breast feeding areas hated all the jumping around. (Maybe TMI, but just saying) You can get aerobic activity without jumping jacks etc. I also think the video is difficult and requires a super in shape person to keep up. Not to mention the bad music, cheesy back drop and I found all the different options difficult to navigate and keep me moving. I am back to my usual workouts and I am back to my pre-baby weight without this video by 4 months. I wish I wouldn't have wasted the money and I am still confused by all the high star ratings."
4,Great postnatal workout!,"This DVD is a great way to get back into shape post baby. What I really like about this DVD is that it encompasses all types of workouts - yoga, pilates, weights, cardio, kickboxing. And I like that you can choose different interavals and mix it up. I've been doing this for 3 weeks now and I've already lost 10 pounds!"
5,The BEST way to get in shape again!!,"I absolutely LOVE this postnatal DVD. I'm about 7 mo's postnatal from my first child. Before starting this DVD about 3 weeks ago, I hadn't exercised much at all for the past year and a half other than some mild, occasional yoga and a lot of brisk walking due to back problems and fear of hurting myself again. But doing this DVD makes me feel athletic and in shape again! I played soccer in college, so I'm comfortable with getting a good hearty workout, but I was seriously afraid that Lindsay would be harsh and too tough on me. But, Lindsay is super upbeat and has a very friendly demeaner. Her exercises really do tackle all the muscles plus leave me feeling tired and breathing better than I have in over a year. It's the perfect workout to do while my baby takes a nap!And I also LOVE the pre-made exercise routines for each week. It makes the decision process of figuring out this DVD very simple."
4,It is what you make it,"Great work out. Was in good shape before pregnancy (long distance runner), this video is a great way to get back into shape. You can make it as hard or as easy as you like. Have the opportunity to change up each work out, add on to it, or make it as short as you like. The background is a little cheesy but its all about the workout right? The cool down is very short, I add extra to it on my own."
5,EXACTLY what I was looking for!,"I was looking for a workout that would ""reasonablely challange me"" and that is exactly what I found! I needed something that would get my in shape (especially my wrecked core) without trying to get me to do something that I am not capable of and this hits the mark! I love that they show different levels so that I can be continually challange. Also, I love that the workouts are broken down into short intervals so that I can tailor a workout to my time frame! Highly recommend this!!!!!!"
4,Great workout!,This workout is great and you have so many options to go at your own pace. Its great for starters and there are also levels that keep adding on to workouts which would be good for people that have worked out quite a bit through their pregnancy. Some of these are very tough workouts but I can feel the burn. No pain no gain!
5,don't have to be a mom...,"I love this dvd and I am not a mom yet! I bought this dvd in March of 2008 and I can say I STILL use it in rotation with other workouts. You can always add weights to keep increasing strength. Lindsay challenges you to push your limits without becoming annoying like other dvds I've done. I experienced noticeable differences in my physical strength, especially after following the 12wk build up program. Overall I lost about 15lbs over about 5 months doing the dvd about 3x a week and watching what I ate. I learned how to change my workouts to keep challenging my body. Of the dvds I've bought, this has been my favorite Lindsay Brin workout. It is fun, challenging and varied. However, none of her dvds will disappoint."
5,Super DVD,"I am very pleased with this DVD. Lindsay Brin understands how challenging it can be to work out seriously post baby. This DVD provides intense workouts that can be cutomized depending on how much time is available. I really love it, and feel like I'm getting that much closer to getting my body back. The best exercise DVD I've seen for new moms!"
4,Post Natal,"This workout dvd is great because you can pick and make your workout however long you want. If you baby starts crying you can cut it short if he/she is doing good you can keep adding 10 mins.After doing it for awhile the warm-up gets really boring. The cool-down is kind-da a joke, I always have to stretch more on my own after the cool-down. BUt over all it's a great dvd for Post Natal!"
2,opened package,Two bottles were purchased.The wrapper one on of the bottles was opened. I thought they would be new and upoened.
3,2 squared minus 2,"Enjoyed the selection titled ""Encinitas"" Title based name on suburban north san diego county city. Song was also used in a recent Movie."
2,2 Squared Minus 2,It was okay. i have heard better. if you like her music you might like this CD. I have heard better from her.
2,Empira Falls,"Bad luck, we were not able to play the DVD due to failure in region code. We did not know such a thing."
3,No Closed caption for Fat Man & Little boy,There is no closed caption or english subtitles for Fat Man and Little Boy. I could not understand one word in three they were saying. The other side of the disc had closed caption. I have not watched it yet. My father worked on the Manhattan Project when he was 26 years old. There are many technical errors. Tickling the tail of the dragon happened at Oak Ridge-not New Mexico. Fritz Foltz
2,bulky battery pack makes for difficult listening,"I thought this player would be cool because it has such a long playing time, but the stupid battery pack that lets you have the extra long time is bulky and doesn't stay in the plug on the back of the player. If you don't plan on using the player as a portable CD player, you should be fine, but if you are thinking about carrying it around, this isn't the player to spend $ on."
5,Good product,This has become a hard to find item. It works well for my purposes. I highly recommend this for people with eye disorders.
4,DIVE INTO THIS BOOK!,"Jeri Howard, private investigator is in Monterey for a restful vacation (or so she hopes)! But she immediately finds herself in the middle of several mysteries -- mutilated pelicans, mysterious accidents at a trendy restaurant and her own cousin accused of murder! This book keeps you interested and moves along at a good pace. Having visited the Monterey/Carmel area, I enjoyed the familiarity of sites mentioned. I am a new reader of female p.i stories but highly recommend this book to others who enjoy this type mystery. I'm glad there are several more Jeri Howard mysteries waiting to be read!!"
5,very funny,enjoyed this movie everytime i've seen it good concept and great acting funny all the way through for anyone who likes a good comedy
4,Overlooked Dreyfuss Gem!,"Often overlooked Dreyfuss film with great character work by the supporting cast and great comedic timing by the lead. Director Pytka created a fine comedic pace with a limited plot, clever editing and a great cast. If you like Dreyfuss comedies, try this one!"
1,let it ride and lucky numbers,"Excited to get these two movies on one disc, however both were corrupted at the worst time, and it didn't get any better. The movies kept stopping and not restarting until the skip feature was used, losing some of the content, four or five times, on both movies. BIG BUMMER"
2,Disappointed,I was dissapointed after reading this book.Must detail was missing and I was left asking many questions.
2,Vague rehash of better books,"""A Guide to Manufacturing Native Replicas with Modern Tools"" might be a more accurate title. Nothing new offered here, just skimpy information that lacks many details and has the feel of material skimmed from other, more informative books. Birch clearly has experience with some of the skills yet his ability to translate knowledge to paper is lacking. Someone who knows what they are doing can fill in the often large gaps in the information, but then they don't need the book, do they? I always look for the one piece of new information that merits the purchase of a book and was hard pressed to find one here. I should add that Burch is a ""professional"" author and writes from that vantage point rather than from that of a practitioner of the skills he covers."
3,overall good,"I bought this book as a resource to learn a little bit more about practical home-made tools, specifically the Cherokee style blow dart gun. It mentions this process and finished product but not in the detail it does for making arrowheads (flintknapping) and crating up a long bow. If your looking for a book for ether of those things including making shafts for arrows this is it. I'm glad I bought the book overall, its much thicker than I originally anticipated as well which was another plus. I rated it only as a 3 because of my anticipation for a more in depth section on weapons. I would buy it again however"
4,"Making Native American Hunting, Fighting, and Survival Tools: The Complete Guide to Making and Using Traditional Tools",Good fast informative read.
2,Disappointment,This manual is very expensive for what you get. It looks like it was published with a copy machine. The illustrations are barely discernable if at all.The manual is a struggle to read. Certainly not what I would expect for the $34.95. I would expect better at half that price.
