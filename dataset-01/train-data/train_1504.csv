3,Unsatisfactory Compilation,"To abridge ""Starless"" is a real mistake, the piece is perfect in its long form ... really, the original albums in question here are so good that you should seek those out instead of spending money on a 4-CD ""sampler"". After appreciating those, you won't have any use for this.I recommend buying 3 of the original albums/CDs instead of this. I'd buy the albums in this order of greatness/preference :In the Court of the Crimson KingStarless and Bible BlackLizardLarks Tongue in AspicRedIslandsIn the Wake of PoseidonAsbury Park, NJ concert without overdubs (available from Crimson web site)instead of ""USA"""
1,Item is not as pictured,"I was sent a polished brass pull vice the antique brass that is advertised. I contacted the seller and was told that I could buy a product from them that would turn the polished brass into antique brass. When I pointed out that the product picture on the amazon site was antique brass, I was told that it was just a picture of the product but not necessarily the item. I find this misrepresentation fraud."
3,Being Frank from Virginia,"I purchased my Jet 13"" Planer/Molder at a trade show for $695 in 1997. I previously used a 12"" Delta for my furniture and finished carpentry work.For some reason I haven't bonded with it after 10 years. I haven't got it out of the 10fpm mode because it seems like it was going to stall in some oak and hickory lumber even at a light setting. The biggest gripe I have is with the old fashion wedge system of securing the blades which takes me about 20 to 30 minutes to do (the Delta spring loaded system takes about 5 minutes). I guess I'm going to give it another chance since my Delta fell off the table onto a concrete floor."
5,UnderGroundKangz got a Underground Thang,"This album is a great second solo album for Bun-B, and a must for any UGK fan. 'Damn im cold' is an example of them country rap tunes, with that southern twang, with a bluesy guitar riff and nice groove. The album has all the types of tracks i like to hear without sounding the same; ridin music, club music, music ya girl will dig, old school, and towards the end of the album the feel switches up to very political, reminiscent, and heartfelt with the tribute to Pimp C. UGK is one of the best rap groups bar none, look into ALL THEIR ALBUMS (anyone can be a one hit wonder, these guys been doin it since the late '80s) RIP PIMP C"
1,Censored!,"I love this album but its censored! One of my favorite songs is basically a series of blank cuts censoring who knows what. Amazon, please mark your products when they are censored. Anyone who buys something assumes they are getting an unedited version unless it is marked otherwise. Such a disappointment."
3,3 stars for this one....,"I agree this one was a little bit commercial, but over all good album. Something you need to hear is the new Lil Keke ""Seven 13 Hustlaz"" check it out that album is hot on the streets!"
3,Step Back for Bun-B,"Everyone else has been giving this cd like 4 and 5 stars and saying that its on point with everything else that he has done. I disagree with that. I feel like II Trill isnt even close to being on the same level of a cd as Trill was. Trill was on fire, II trill is a little more commercial and poppy than Trill. Overall he had a few good tracks but I listened to it about 3 times and was pretty much done with it. Yea Pimp C is missing from this album, but that cant be an excuse cause Pimp C was only on one track in Trill. It just aint that great and I would expect more from Bun."
2,Music as a Money Grab,"I grew up on East Coast rap such as Schooly D, Public Enemy and BDP, but I never thought that it would bias me in any way towards quality hip hop. I must be wrong because people love this CD and I don't. The sound that emanates from the ""dirty south"" is all about being gangsta and spending money foolishly... topics that I found tiresome in the early 90's when it was still relatively fresh.There is one song that makes an attempt to address social issues, but it comes off as contrived due to the rest of the album's topics of interest. How can you rap about local politics forcing one into a life of crime as being a bad thing when you glorify the fruits of your ""labor"" the rest of the album?"
2,disapointment,All the hype for this cd and nothing delivered. I was toltally disapointed in Bun-B for this one.... I mean I figurred he had alot to rap about with loosing Pimp-C but I guess his train of thought was elsewere.... O well Im not loosing hope in one of the greatest but this albulm was defffiantly garbageee.RIP PIMP C
4,"Good Short Stories before bed, but not ""Classic""","I bought this book for my daughter's 5th birthday so we could have a good bedtime book. The stories are classic in the sense that they have some of the original characters and some of the original themes, but they are slightly condensed. For example, we read the story ""101 Dalmations"" one night, and the story ended happily but prematurely. My wife and I looked at each other quizzically because we knew there was much more to the story, but my daughter enjoyed it. It appears some of the stories are edited to fit in the short format, which is fine if that is what you expect. When I read the other reviews and the description, I expected full length stories. This book is very good and we thoroughly enjoy the stories, but if you want complete stories that are ""Classic Disney"" you won't get them here. Prepare for a slightly condensed version of classic stories. Overall, still a great product."
4,Shame this was discontinued,"It's a shame this volume was discontinued--there are some good stories here and it is an excellent value. The illustrations are very nice. The writing is OK, but nothing special. It tends to be rather bland--somewhat more than a condensed description of what happened in a cartoon--but it does the job. The stories themselves are obviously appealing to kids, and our little boy liked most but not all of these stories. He particularly enjoyed some that you might not expect, like ""Bootle Beetle's Adventure"" and ""The Old Mill."" You can see video versions of these on YouTube, by the way."
5,Excellent resource,I found it to be a very thorough exegesis of the text and helpful in seeing the organic structure native to Mark. Worth having and working through.
2,Much potential but underwhelming,"The back cover summary was an instant sell for me; singer from a band I like writing about the influence of a band I like, with the added depth of adolescent discovery of music in a time before the internet made indie rock accessible to anyone. Being a music nerd, I wanted to read some hardcore fandom over The Replacements. I learned nothing about the band that I didn't already know. This is more of a musing of Colin Meloy's coming-of-age with music in general. It doesn't seem to fit with the 33 1/3 series.Also, I wanted to see more of a voice in the writing. It's not bad, and there were snippets where I thought, Yes! This is what this book should be! But too much of it meanders in a very basic fashion that feels more like a book report than an inspired memoir."
3,File under autobiography,"Now I love the Decemberists and even enjoy the Colin Meloy sings Morrissey Ep but if you are looking for in-depth, fly-on-the-studio-wall-type account of this seminal album or even if you are looking for breathtaking critical rundowns, you should look elsewhere. The book is charming as autobiography but reads as a weak entry in this series when read against the tour de force of say Franklin Bruno... yes I know they all almost read as underplayed compared to the boook on Armed Forces but I didn't buy those."
1,This was worthless had nothing to do with the Replacements!,I have bought other books in the series and I was hoping this would be a description surounding the making of Let It be by the Replacements. I was interested in the sounds and the songs and the methods for making this great record. What I got was the memoirs of a flavor of the month indie rock singer talking in way too much detail about mix tapes from middle school. I think choosing this kid to write about such a great band was a mistake.This book has very little to do with the Replacements.Collin is qualified to write about the Shins perhaps but not the Replacements.
1,False Advertising,"I have never listened to The Decemberists and now, after reading this book, never will. Thank God I borrowed it from a library rather than plunking down my hard earned cash for it. After reading the installment in their series on In Utero I was shocked - SHOCKED - to be confronted with the self indulgent and lazy prattle in this slim volume. Not only is there precious little about the album (which I thought these books were supposed to focus on the making of), but this autobiography is also peppered with editorial mistakes, e.g., the use of ""it's"" when ""its"" would have been correct, describing a car doing a ""360"" when he actually meant ""180"" (a mistake that's ""Presidential"", in the Bush sense). Please, 33-1/3 publishers, exercise a little quality control."
1,Just Don't Get the Point...,"I've been a Thrash-metal fan since way back in the 80's. I remember seeing t-shirts here and there of Wehrmacht, but never actually heard them until now. I must say that the other reviews are right on as far as the description of their sound, but I personally don't care for this band one bit. Just a lot of very fast NOISE to me. I don't think they sound like any of the mentioned bands, either. Their sound is very unique; just pure speed. The vocalist is terrible, but I did find some of the guitar work good. Sorry, but don't get this if you're expecting to hear early Megadeth, Slayer or Kreator... These guys were their own sound. They sound way-more like punk than metal..."
2,Not terribly impressive,"Well-known classicist Sir Kenneth Dover once described Hans Licht's absurd book on Greek sexuality as a ""very bad book."" One can't *quite* call Bova's book ""very bad""--that honor has to go to David Gemmell's two forays into ancient Macedonia, LION OF MACEDON and THE DARK PRINCE--but this is far from a *good* book. For a man known to complain about bad science in novels, this reviewer finds it terribly ironic to see such bad and/or outdated history in this one. Bova might do well to take his own advice and stick to what he knows: science, not history."
4,Another winner in awesome series!,This is fun and exciting reading. Ben Bova is a literary giant in this genre.
3,Entertaining,"I can't vouch for the historical accuracy of this one, but I will say that I was quite entertained. A fast, fun read, no more--but sometimes that's exactly what I want."
2,A Poor Choice,Don't bother with this product. It's not well made. The reservoir lacks a cover (a bizarre design choice). The water flow control is clumsy and imprecise.
4,Flossing replacement (almost),"I use it as a regular flossing replacement so I only need to floss intermittently. It fits on the faucet bench and I leave it there permanently. I always empty it after use, and add a dash of listerene. My first was faulty and leaked - I bought it at Amazon so they sent me a new one, shipping paid. It has been 5 years and it has finally stopped working (the washers eroded). I might try the QuickBreeze faucet extension next, but I will be buying another one of these as well, or maybe the newer ""Ultra Water Flosser"" if it fits on my bench and offers any benefits. I like the adjustable jet stream.Pros: cheap (get what u pay 4), works exactly right.Cons: cheap plastic product - not designed to last, noisy too."
2,Not worth the money,"For a book titled Clinical Information Systems, you would think that would be the contents. Unfortunately it is not. Old re-hashed arguments about CPOE, a non-informative review of security, a little touch of imaging IT and that's about it. Nary a mention of clinical systems such as laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, clinical documentation, etc. A rather disappointing product. I have serious reservations about the rest of the texts from this publisher after reading this publication."
1,Does not include what it says it does,This seller will not return any email correspondence and ships an item different from what is supposed to be received. Not recommended
4,great product!,The product was shipped fast and it is a great product love the video not to hard to follow if you have done step areobics before!
2,Disappointed,"Anyone who likes a very fast paced, highly choreographed routine should like this. It is probably a good work out, if you can keep up. The moves are changed to quickly. You'll need to learn the routine before you can complete the workout. Too much of a hassle for me."
4,An interesting choice for MTV,"While I respect and enjoy the majoroty of the bands on this compilaion, I must say that this is the first time I have seen MTV acknowledge Taking Back Sunday and Brand New. They are both bands who have released soid albums but are rarely publicised. However, I don't understand why MTV would associate the bands on this album with Road Rules-a show mainly affiliated with mainstream pop and rock. Regardless, the album contains good music... The bands choose what labels and companies they want to work with, and they deserve to be rich and famous. They've worked for it."
4,"they put the ""this RULES!!!"" in Road Rules!","First of all, I completely agree with the other review of this CD. I didn't want to support MTV at all. They DO exploit bands. But, I couldn't resist buying this CD, because it had so many artists I like. I also found out about new bands by buying this CD. I was already a fan of AFI, and several other bands on this CD, but I found out about a lot of new songs. If you're a punk, alternative, or hard rock fan then I suggest this CD, but resist buying it if you CAN cuz it DOES support MTV which is bad. DL the songs!"
1,Boycott MTV !!!! It is the ANTICHRIST,"Why would Roadrunner put their good name on a CD with such Horrible music (with the exception being the Deftones a great band)the rest are just a bunch of Kid pop punk (New found glory need to be shot)and crappy Emo bands.C'mon this is roadrunner, a record label with such awesome artists such as Soulfly, Type-o negative,Killswitch Engage, Coal Chamber(R.I.P.) and at the time of this release Fear Factory. They couldn't put tracks from the aforwementioned artists on the compilation? WTF? They Might as well have put Rap or Brittney Spears on this load of crap! One star because of the Deftones otherwise...No stars, no way!!!"
5,Great South African tea,"I was brought up drinking this caffeine free tea at home in South Africa and now my sons enjoys it so much that I'm considering buying in bulk. He drinks it with soy milk and a little honey, and can't seem to get enough of it.I'm just glad I'm able to get it here in the US now.Buying it like this is also a much better deal than in some stores."
2,Stale tea,"Although this tea is shown to be best by 13/10/11, it was prepared on 14/7/2010, which was over a year ago. I can see now why it was only $11 for 160 tea bags. The flavor of the tea seems dull compared to other Rooibos teas I have tried. I suspect it's stale. Buyer beware."
5,freshpak rooibos tea,thanks soooooo much for promptly attending to my complain. i got the package and must say again that i was really impressed with your customer service. Merry christmas....toni
1,Not real rooibos,"It did not taste like the original product from South Africa, in fact it felt like a rip off. Dissapointed"
3,A few of the better channels (not really UFOs),"This tape includes actual footage of a few of the better channels working in the late 1980s. One of the best is the entity called Bashar channeled through Daryl Anka. There's also a segment with Lazaris. I think both of these entities claim to be highly evolved (quasi-angelic) extra-terrestrials, so perhaps that is the UFO coneection. There's a brief audio clip of Seth (through Jane Roberts) and some comments by Rick Stack who is stil involved with spreading the word of Seth. The tape was interesting to me because I've read a great deal of channeled material but had not seen the phenomenon take place. Its only on VHS but the small price is worth it if you are a fan of this stuff like I am."
1,Don't Bother,This movie is awful. Sound and audio are terrible. Jim Carrey should be embarrassed.The only thing that could help this movie is to turn it off.
1,"Idiotic, boring, nonsensical waste of time","The acting was stiff and vapid, the filming was grainy and amateurish, the story was non-existent. A good Rx for insomnia, this forgettable piece of rubbish has only one redeeming quality: Seeing young Jim Carey trying to make the most of a boring script and insipid role."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst movie ever. Jim was only 21 years old when he made this movie and there is ABSOLUTELY nothing funny about it!95% of this 60 minute movie is Rita Coolidge, Ronnie Hawkins, And Bill Champlin singing and a bunch of skiers skiing. Take my word for it Copper Mountain(A.K.A Club Med.) is eeeexxxxttttrrreeeemmmeeellllyyyy BAD!If you want to see a funny Jim movie watch Bruce Almighty, Ace Ventura or Liar Liar instead. Even Jim himself has said this movie was a big mistake."
1,Just plain bad,"I rented this strictly out of curiosity since I heard it was bad. Guess what? IT IS. The plot here is almost non-existent. Jim Carrey and Alan Thicke, in Before They Were Stars mode, star as two single guys who go to Club Med Copper Mountain for fun and thrills. Jim can't be himself around women and scares them off, and Alan wants to be the world's best skier. That 20 minute plot is wrapped around 40 minutes of music. It is almost makes no sense. The film (all 59 minutes of it) also makes the now-defunct Club Med Copper Mountain look like a pretty boring place. This also reminded me of those specials they used to release in syndication to independent television stations during the 80s. The DVD does not have a start menu, no features, and repeats after it is over (which I guess is to torture the viewer)."
1,I will give you this movie.,"This movie is terrible. Do not buy it. Really, I'm not exaggerating. I will give you this movie free of charge. You'll have to send me a SASAE, but other than that, it's yours for the asking. After you watch it, we can go for drinks and talk about how truly terrible it is. Perhaps a pact to slit our wrists or trepan our skulls will follow, which is more fun than watching it to be sure."
1,A Glorified Commercial,"This thankfully brief title cannot even be called a movie; it is a glorified ad for the ski slopes and entertainment at Club Med. It is only worth a viewing if you REALLY have to see a young Jim Carrey doing good impersonations of Steve Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. singing Mr. Bo Jangles. And if you want to see what Get Smart's Hymie the Robot has been up to! Otherwise, you would have to be a fan of skiing championships or the musical performers (see other reviewer's comments for musicians' names; I forget who they are) that dominate this overlong commercial."
1,Minus 5 stars,"I bought this video because it was closeout cheap and had Jim Carey (the early years) and that I knew could be bad, and it was. I can't believe someone rated this 5 positive stars. Young inexperience comedian Jim Carry was at his worst. As they say ""his stik was broken"". This was a music video gone wrong...someone called it a movie. And what was the sheet and rope used for? I have no idea. I may have missed the best scene. I really like Carey in SOME OF HIS LATER VIDEOD, HE WAS SUPER! However, I tossed this disk in the trash. P.S. I have no idea what ""piece of shaith"" means, but it but it came up as a suggested tag and it sounded bad so I used it."
1,This is not a comedy.. It's not even a movie,"This supposed comedy is only 60 minutes long. And that's the one good thing about it. Much of the time consists of concerts with various artists I haven't heard of. The rest is a series of unfunny scenes with no plot. It's not worth wasting your time or money on, even if you're a die-hard Jim Carrey fan. Even he isn't funny in this one."
3,Actors get better with time too...,"I live in the old Club Med building at Copper Mountain Resort and when I saw this movie I had to have it. It is old and kind of boring, but still an entertaining item to own."
5,A family favorite. A must own!,"Glen Rounds both wrote and illustrated this true story about a summer that he and his sister spent trying to figure out how to get onto a gentle horse and ride it. The boy is about 8 and the girl looks to be about 6. The brother and sister have a close, loving relationship and they have a ball despite many thwarted efforts. These young children show wonderful problem-solving skills, creative thinking and perseverance. The old gentle horse even comes to love these children although he does not make it easy for them. Repeatedly they struggle to get their short bodies upon the horses' back only to slide off and fall to the ground (uninjured). My two boys aged 3 and 6 love this story and beg to hear it over and over. I found it by scanning the stacks at the public library; now we must buy our own copy to keep. Just a very cute story with simple themes, it is ""good stuff"" for the soul."
2,Great until the very last page,"I purchased this book for my horse-loving six year old. There aren't that many picture books about horses, so I thought this was a good find. Thank GOODNESS I read the book through before giving it to her. It starts off so nicely and delightfully tells the story of an old stray horse that the kids befriend. They have a lovely summer with the horse. Then you are hit like a brick wall with the last page: the horse is abruptly taken away from the children to the ""high pasture"" never to be seen or heard from again (presumably to die). I was horrified. My child is sensitive, especially about animals. She would have been terribly upset by the way the book ended. So, I just cut out the last page and gave her the book without it. What a real shame to ruin an otherwise delightful book."
4,Keeps Those Records On,"The past few years really haven't brought much in the way of newer artists for the music industry that sound just simply fresh and soulful. What I like about Corrine Bailey Rae is her simplicity and tone with her music. It just feels beautiful and elequent with each tone on her breakout single, Put Your Records On, the second track from her debut album. The song is a delight to listen to. I like this song a whole lot because it isn't overconjured and it just is a great down to Earth song. I just really am expecting much more from this promising voice down the road. She sounds delightful.Song: B+"
4,corinne is refreshingly talented,"in a world where many famous singers don't actually have much talent, Corinne Bailey Rae is a lovely addition to the music scene with her beautiful, unique and warm voice. It is so relaxing to listen to, and very carefree. This album is perfect for summer!"
4,Left wanting more!,"I love her music. However, I didn't realize until I got the CD that there are only two tracks on it. It was like getting an old 45 record or a demo tape."
2,WHERE'S the REST of the CD?....I was confused!,"When I first played the CD...I thought my CD player was broken...or that there was something wrong with this new CD! However, in checking the case a little closer, it said: QUOTE ""2 track single, EXPECT TO PAY NO MORE THAN $2.00."" UnquoteI paid three times that amount without being told I was getting 2 songs.That's not truthful advertising or honest pricing! I'm NOT disappointed in the singer, Ms. Corinne Bailey Rae, but I surely didn't realize I was paying that much for 2 teeny songs!! signed...""disappointed in the marketing!"""
1,rip off,"I understood this to be a 2 cd deal...when in fact it was 1 cd and a single with 1/2 songs included on the original cd. I paid $8 bucks for 1 song and was displeased to find that i could not return it as it had been opened. I like the artist so i didn't fuss but the set-up was shady...""buy these 2 for this deal"" when in fact it was a one song deal. SUck!"
3,Put This Record On,"This single and the CD it comes off of won't live up to all the hype -- just not that distinctive and authentic -- killed by very mediocre production. This record can't decide if it wants to be jazz or radio friendly R & B pop. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean we all don't need some really great cd's to sip coffee, wine, drive and clean too. This is one of those records. Nothing ground breaking but nothing upleasant either."
1,Sounds like Norah Jones in a Strait Jacket yikes!!!!,this voice be having me Scurred on the Real. i can't get with that singing at all. my local channel been playing her song&I just don't get it. sounds like Norah Jones in a Strait Jacket to my ears. avoid this.
3,OK...but....,"I used the black kit in my 2012 Tacoma with a Pioneer single din head unit AVH-P6300BT. Issues were that the bracket (made of plastic) had too much flex in it, such that, the overall unit did not seal flush vertically with the stock console. There is a small space about 1/2 way down the console/kit interface. If you press on it it you can get it flush but the bracket has too much play in it to seal the space. If a metal bracket was included this probably wouldn't be an issue. Also a CON, the insert around the head unit is a bit warped and doesn't quite fit flush. There's some sag in the center above head unit.All in all, it's worked out OK for what's available. Got the silver too, this did not match my interior at all....why I went with the black.Had to drill out the two slots in the pocket to fit cables for a scan (OBDI) and subwoofer volume control."
4,The Real Representer,"I think its fair to say that after this album Ghostface could lay claim to having, at a meagre total of two, one more dope album in his catalogue than any of his other Wu brethren. There's isn't much that's clever to be said about this one: the soulful beats bang from start to finish and Ghost holds it all together wonderfully. There are a couple of nice cameos from Raekwon, Method Man, and Redman (""yo weed got more seeds than ODB!""). If you like 'em loud and funky, this one's for you."
4,Wu-Tang again!,"This album silences everyone of you m@*haf&*kers who said Wu fell off. Supreme Clientele delivers only built for cuban linx-quality rhymes over dope liquid swords beats in an extremely tight and well produced album, just check Wu Banga and Buck 50. Ghostface flows passionately like he did back in the day and all the other Wu members fit into the album like puzzle pieces. Only rza can put together a mind blowin, beat kickin production like this. My one complaint other than the fact that raekwon isn't on enough tracks is that rzas Bobby digital style clashes too much with ghosts real, street, dark style. I dont know what the hell rza was thinking with some of those BD samples. However, this doesn't effect the overall flow of the album. This is the only true wu album to be released since Wu forever, and the album reminds you why you came to the Wu in the first place."
4,"Really good, but not great.","Bottom line with this album- HOT BEATS AMAZING STYLE. However, despite Ghost's unique voice and his interesting vocabluary, I sometimes wonder what the hell is going through his head when he spits rhymes that make no sense. OH WELL, he still manages to make this gibberish very entertaining, unlike Cappadonna who just sounds like an ... in his crazy rhymes. Supreme Clientele is still a sweet Wu Album."
5,in a class by itself....,"It's going down as a classic. It's definitely got alot of influence on alot of people who started after this album dropped. His other albums are pretty decent too but, this one defines ""street philosophy"", ""most unique versatile beats"", and ""lyrical wordplay at its best"". One of the few Wu-tang solo efforts to stand out on their own from beginning to end. ""Tical..."
5,cd full o' lovin,"Holy cow! I've been waiting a loooooong time for this cd. I was not disappointed. Ghost is sick. This is one of those classics albums where you put it in and press play. All the guest spots are ill...RZA is the mack dad as usual. Meth, Genius, even Redman blow up. Ghost is back...and hopefully the clan can follow suit."
3,"good cd, not great.","Okay, so I'm probably being a little hard on this album. It makes me feel bad giving it a 3, but I am really not feeling this album as much as everyone else seems to. It is really just average in my mind, with a few standout cuts on it. One thing that really bugged me was that the last few cuts were skits. There were also way too many skits, some of them being longer than most of the songs. Not good Ghost. My favorite has to be track #3 ""One"". The beat was on point and the lyrics were ill. The CD was easily worth the money that I got it for at the used shop, but I dont know if I'd be satisfied w/ it after doling out [more than that]. So I say listen to this one before you buy, because you might end up disappointed."
5,Nice,"This CD is off Da Hook. Ghost Drops heavy flows and beats that catches you off guard. His monolouges are catchy too. When you first pop in the album you expect to hear that same old rap flow by Wu Tang, but Ghost accually changed his whole flow. That's what keeps you in this game and he flourishes it. This is a great album."
5,Classic Tony Starks.....,"I love this CD. Ghost can sometimes come off wierd with his lyrics. He lyrics can come off like Cappadonna, but thats only a rare ocasions. The whole CD is a wonderful redemption for the Wu. A must for any hip-hop fan."
4,Tight-arse CD.,"This CD is one of the best Wu-sides to date. Ghostface is the storyteller of hip-hop. Like Bob Dylan with a voice and a beat. It's a bit confusing track # wise. The only place I've seen an accurate listing is HERE. But, that doesn't take away from the music any so go buy. Meanwhile, I'm gonna go buy Liquid Swords."
5,His best to date,"Supreme Clientele is SUPREME, my favorite out of his other recordings. I love this album."
4,Slammin' LP,"This is the best solo album from a Wu-Tang artist except ""Liquid Swords"" by the Genius. Supreme Clientele is a good, consistant album with great production and lyrics. On the first track ""Nutmeg"" featuring the RZA was great. There is many other great songs like ""We made It"", ""Malcolm"" but the best track is ""Wu Banga 101"" which features Raekwon, GZA & Cappadonna. This album is not a classic, but this album is very far from garbage."
5,Tony Starks does it again!,Back in '95 I didn't think it was possible for Ghost to top his first album (Ironman). But he came back five years later and did it again. This album is one the illest cds i have. If you are a true wu-gambino you are missing out on one of the top hip-hop albums of 2000. Buy it and Buy it now!
5,supreme clintele,"one of the best hip hop albums of the year.beautifully mastered beats from the rza and tight lyrics by ghostface.if you thought ""ironman"" was good,this will blow you away.this album has the usual hip hop beats but enhanced and it also has bits of jazz,and all kinds of sounds and noises,straight out of rza's bag of tricks.this is tight!!!"
5,ghostface killah brought it back,"from beginning to end this cd is good.it's not like the first ghostface killah cd, but it's just as good.if your a true wu fan dont sleep on this album, it's tight.there are a lot of wu-tang clan members that appear on this album, and thats great.rza gets of dope on ""stroke of death"".there's not much to say about this cd, but get it!"
2,This is not the album to redeem the Wu,"I really wanted this to be good. But I was disappointed again by the Wu. There are three problems with this album: the beats, the lyrics and the vocal delivery. In other words, there's not much I can praise about it. The beats are mostly repetitive samples from old soul tunes. The soundscapes are at their best dull, and at worst irritating. The lyrics are too esoteric - Ghostface Killah's jargon is often unpenetrable. The lyrical content becomes unintelligible and is reduced to background noise - which is great if you're looking for wallpaper music. The vocal delivery is flat and monotone - there are no interesting changes in rythmn, tone or accent. Very little to please me here. As a fan of the Wu's early work, I'm disappointed again."
2,Supremely disappointing.,The only things that saved this album from getting only one star were the excellent production and the guest MCs. Ghost himself was just very disappointing. His lyrics just didn't flow. He sounded like he was just out of step with the beats...they just didn't blend very well. The fact that the music and the vocals seemed out of sync tended to grate on my ears...I just couldn't listen to the album for very long. Major disappointment. What happened Mr. Starks?
2,nearly completly wack,"This cd almost completly sucks.Not one song rates to 5 stars.Only 1 song is worth 4 stars(apollo kids).And then there r 3 songs that get 3 stars,and then the cd suxxx.The remaining good songs are Saturday Night,Wu Banga,& Mighty Healthy.Other than than those 4 songs,the cd sux.TOP 5:the 4 songs i stated previously,Appolo Kids,Mighty Healthy,Wu Banga 101,& Saturday Night"
1,IT'S SORRY! U WANT A GOOD ALBUM?........GET ME!,"I thought it was very sorry! I was xtremely dissapointed sincec it was my man ghost, but u can still always get my album......""Beneath the Surface"""
3,Pretty Good CD,"This is a pretty good CD. Many of the bachatas were good, but not dancable (or at least not fast enought to be a good dancing song)"
1,SELF CENTERED,"I was deeply disappointed in this book. I thought it went on and on and on with out getting anywhere. While I was saddened over the writters daughter, he isnt the first to have a sick child nor, will he be the last. Way to much oh poor me. Do not waste your money on this one. I might check it out of the library if it was the only book available. On second thought I probably wouldnt.This author was totally self absorbed. PLEASE feel sorry for me.I hope he has a day job."
2,A wanna be,If you think this book gonna make you reach you are wrong . It's a nice written book with littel information
1,I want my money BACK,"5 Reasons why not to buy this product1. It squiels like a pig (high pitch sound) 2. Its slow 3. Tech support is in India 4. When you upgrade the OS it goes even slower. 5. THE WORST UP TIME I'VE EVER SEEN. I really wanted to use this for a cross product (mac,pc,ps3, and Wii) node to a fast internet connection... I didn't get that. Trust me please look else where. In the end if they don't give me a refund I'll have to say I'm going with D-Link :)"
3,VPN that is only compatible with Linksys products,"This is a nifty router and pretty to look at, don't get me wrong. You plug it in, bring up the controlling web page, and soon it will be connected to the web and to both your wired and wireless machines. Problem is, I bought this router to tunnel into a Lucent IPSEC VPN gateway at work. I also tried to connect to a Netgear VPN router. In both cases, some of the options you need to make the connection work are missing. Put simply, use of this router to tunnel to an outside VPN gateway or router will probably not work unless you are going to connect to a Linksys (or perhaps a Cisco) solution. Linksys tech support, while good, can only demonstrate that the router functions with their own equipment (which they easily set up by remote management of my router). In conclusion, for VPN from the router to an outside VPN gateway or router, it appears that the WRVS4400N will only support Linksys at the other end of the tunnel."
3,Needs Firmware Updates - Has Potential,"Otherwise a good buy for small or home offices... This device really needs a firmware update to correct its inability act as a DHCP relay. Tech support is aware of the problem, but has no ETA for release of the new firmware fix.I have heard others complain about that WRVS4400N's wireless-N is not all it's hyped to be in terms of extended range + speed. I personally haven't witnessed this problem yet.On the upside Linksys did release the device OS to the OpenSource community, hopefully we'll see some good Linux distributions for it soon."
1,Horrible Product,"I'm a networking professional, this router is nothing but trouble. I had to constantly reboot the router as it would stop providing wireless service to my network. I had to disable most of the security services just to get it to work for more than 24 hours.Just a bad product, period."
1,Terrible product,This routers locks up at least once a week. Firmware upgrade did not help a bit. I bought it seduced by many features it has offered. Big mistake.
1,"High pitch sound, Wireless Drops out","The title pretty much says it all. Was a very promising product. Unfortunately, that's all it was... a promise.My unit makes a high pitch noise that will drive anyone insane.The wireless either won't grab an IP address or it will drop out shortly after.If this product isn't recalled, then there is something wrong with the world."
1,One of the worst products from Linksys,I have multiple linksys routers and this one had two very powerful processors instead of usual one but the performance is terrible. I believe the firmware is full of bugs. The wireless draft.N is unstable as well as my connection to the internet. My connection speed was variable between 10mbs to 10kbs with no apparent reason and I was disconnecting almost every hour. I returned the router and put my old one back and everything is back to normal.
1,"Useless, wireless cuts out frequently","The wireless cuts out frequently and the VPN was difficult to configure. If you're set on this product, wait until the next firmware update--at least."
1,The worst wireless router I have ever bought,Drops wireless connection everyday. I have to reset it everyday. Wireless range is very poor. It is not worth the price. I am using the latest firmware 1.01.03 which is released on 10/25/2007. No improvement even after the firmware update.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE,Problems ive had includes the device randomly forgetting configuration. I also patched the device to the lastest firmware and the device started needing to be rebooted every two to three hours. I located the issues on their website from over 6 months ago and they where all known issues with the firmware that they recommend. When i voiced these concerns 'in a very constructive manner' on their forums they removed my comments from the forum. They sell this device as business class yet support it like a 30 dollar end user print server. This is the most dissapointing network device i have ever owned. Do not buy this device!
2,Big Problems with VPN,This router has major VPN issues. Check the Linksys forum for details.Basic routing functions seem to work ok.
1,Horrible router...stay away,"After having several Linksys routers I kind of trusted the brand, well I wasted my money on this one, it has nice features and that is why I found it attractive but simple things like enabling the firewall will block remote management, there may be a workaround but you don't want to buy this thing to spend hours of googling workarounds, so far that is what I have done, simply put don't waste your money. So far I have had no luck on getting the VPN going...will update when I get it running but it is not straight forward as you would expect."
4,Very Good Product,"I put off buying this product because of the reviews others left. I wish I hadn't. The product works as advertised and I can attest that my Wireless G connection was around LOW with a High gain Antenna. I added the new Wireless ""N"" Card and Router and the connection went up in signal strength and in terms of Bandwidth. I will say that having installed several Linksys products, I find that NOT using their setup disk makes things much smoother for me at least."
1,Waste of money and time.,"I bought this router for its vpn capabilities (or should I say lack thereof). After a week and trying multiple firmware revisions, configurations (including alternative vpn client software), and tens of hours troubleshooting I'm giving up. I wasn't ever able to connect via vpn. This router is a waste of money. I used to swear by Linksys products. The last two have been Cisco branded, expensive and nothing but trouble."
2,Noisy and no SSL (?!),"Nice router, though it lacks a crucial business item in that it does not provide port forwarding for port 443 (SSL). That means that OWA will not work behind this router. You can connect to SSL sites, but you cannot host a SSL server. All Exchange Servers require SSL nowadays. Ugh.Also, the unit is quite noisy. It gives off a high pitched whine constantly and is only abated by pulling the LAN ports, thus making it worthless.Linksys has these bugs listed on its website dated from back in November..."
1,Expensive junk,"This router has been nothing but an expensive pain, a black hole for troubleshooting, and Cisco/ Linksys stopped supporting the first versions of it very soon after I purchased one. Obviously, they would like to pretend they never made this device. The N wireless is slow, disconnects, and has no range at times. Perhaps disable the wireless and use it as an expensive little switch? Not sure it can be trusted for that. They should have been recalled! We tossed this in a corner and switched back to a reliable 54G we had around."
1,Already failed,"I've been looking thru my past Amazon orders, because I was certain I bought my 4400N from Amazon. Alas, I couldn't find it, but one thing IS certain: this product has already failed. I'm guessing I bought it very shortly after it was released, since it would have been one of the most highly-touted products in it's class. I'm very disappointed in this router. There's no reason for a product like this to just stop functioning."
3,"VPN and remote WoL, beware!","I bought this router to add VPN capability to my home for when I'm traveling. Unfortunately, it does not support PPTP VPN connections (such as that built-in to Windows). Furthermore, QuickVPN does not run on Windows 7 machines, so you can forget connecting by SSL VPN (which is supposed to support individual computer connections). I suppose connecting the IPSec VPN tunnel from one router to another router would work fine, but I could not get it to connect to my computer even using Shrewsoft IPSec VPN client.Also, if you would like to use the Wake-on-LAN feature remotely, forget it. Cisco does not allow it. With my old router, I could wake my computer from hybernation remotely, connect to it with VNC, and then put it back into hybernation when I was done - from anywhere on the internet. Not with this router. I'm exchanging it for the Engenious EVR100."
2,"Great Ideas, Poor Implementation","I got this router for my home office, where it serves as our Internet gateway and then connects to a switch for distributing the LAN.The features are good conceptually, and many of them work fine, but there is one key issue with this router: it kills Internet connectivity. Its core security feature, IPS, turns our 35/35mbps FiOS connection into roughly 20/12, and it prevents our FiOS Video On Demand from functioning properly - video looks totally corrupt and scrambled. Switching off the IPS immediately resolves both of these problems for the most part, but the video signal remains slightly (but noticeably) distorted.If you're looking for a good router, either sacrifice security or buy something with a faster processor."
2,Router doesn't work,"I even called my provider to help install this thing, but still It will not send signals to a computer that is onky 40 ft away. I wasted my money."
5,Time to update all these bad reviews.,"I have owned the WRVS4400N for about 2 years now and stumbled across all thes old outdated reviews, so I thought I would update them. It is true, when this router first came out, it had some issues, however a few firmware updates later and the issues are gone. This is an excellent router and I highly recommend it. The negative reviews featured on this page are outdated and no longer apply. If you find one of these at a reasonable price, buy it. The combination of features and available settings is exemplary and they all work flawlessly."
1,WRVS4400n LOCKS UP.,We have a small business network and purchased this router primarily for internet access. The router LOCKS UP several times per week and must be powered down/up to get it restored. Even that proceedure can take 2-3 attempts before you get it back up. This major problem makes the router unreliable and completely useless in our application. We spent MANY wasted hours trying to trouble shoot this problem and believe it may simply be a design flaw in the product. We will be relocating it to the dumpster and researching a higher quality product from a different manufacturer.
1,"Lots of bugs, intermittent operation","I purchased this wireless router for my business so I could VPN into my local network. I also purchased the corresponding N-PCMCIA card for my laptop while in the office.After spending many hours with my IT guy, this thing doesn't work.- The browser based setup utility is slow and hangs a lot.- We never could really get the VPN to work (the QuickVPN software would lock up the entire router).- The router would intermittently drop the wireless connection.Wireless-N isn't fully baked yet. The little it did work, we found that the 12X speed is a bit of an exageration.+ The only this thing is good for is an overpriced 4-port switch....This one is certainly going back to Amazon."
2,Only the basic works,"If you are looking for a basic router, it will probably work. However, if you are planning to take of the VPN functions beware. For reasons still uknown, this router doesn't work with our VoIP PBX. Linksys has confirmed the problem, but has yet to provide new firmware. Ended up having to swith it out with a WRV54G. It is old, but it gets the job done...."
2,BAD EXPERIENCE,"router WRVS4400NMy router failled and i try to fix it Downgrade router from 2.0.2.1 to 2.0.1.3, reset it to factory defaults and put the settings back manually, but finally this is not was possible.CU did testing and the router continue with the same problem.I tried disabling IPS and setting in the wireless, but still the sameproblem. I determined that the router is defected.My advised to get get router RV220W which anexcellent choice."
4,works great,I got the cisco WRVS4400N router very quickly. I had a few questions about setting up the vpn and remote access. The tech line was very helpfull and got me going. I will buy another one of these for my home when my old one goes out.
1,Useless paperweight,"This router is now obsolete. You cannot get support for it anymore. The one I own also locks up everyday now. On really hot days, it will lock up and seize multiple times. You have to pull the power cord and restart it. Kind of useless now. I am going back to my old buddy, Netgear."
3,The solution....Not,To allow a Linksys N router and Cisco router to work together is a sad tale of woe. I spent over 16 hours of phone-in tech time with both companies to resolve the problem. In the end I sent back the Cisco router as it couldn't configure to work.
2,Mac users do not get this product,"I read all the reviews and still bought this Router. I was so disappointed with it out of the box, meaning it is much smaller than pictured and weighs nothing, it had to be crap. I tried to return it to office depot but they would take it back. So Im stuck with it and have to use it Easy enough to set up but for some reason it loses the signal on our Macs every so often. Several times a day where you have to turn airport off and on again to get it to work. We also have a PC and that works fine. We have a big house and the wifi coverage is pretty good.I'm not looking for a Router that works all the time and not some of the time.I can not recommend this product."
1,"New Edition was available, book excellent, price a scam here.","This book is several years old, and a new edition is available at less that half the price. The new edition is the best source of information and guidance available. If you are putting up an antenna, you need this book, just don't buy the outdated editions they are selling here on ebay at 2 or more times the price of the current edition. I hope this helps others avoid falling into this trap."
1,Shop Fox D3227,The product I recieved does not match the description. It seems the backing plate does not align precisely so when you clamp a large piece of material the miters do not precisely align.. The product I recieved is not the light blue as pictured. It is black cast iron and it arrived covered with grease. I would return it but there is a ten dollar restocking fee.
3,A Crooked Mile,"A Crooked Mile tells the story of several families from Bolton, England, both rich and poor, beginning after World War I. It follows the life of Megan Duffy, a girl born to a large family without much money and focusses on her connections with family, friends, and the various townspeople as she grows older.I didn't greatly enjoy this book and couldn't really relate to the characters or the scene it was set in. The author didn't give much background on the class structure and level of poverty at that time in the UK; this would have been helpful, but I saw a five star review on amazon.co.uk so maybe I'm simply not British enough for this book...although modern British chick lit is one of my favourite genres. The book really dragged in the middle for me and I feel this is where I lost touch with the characters and didn't really care what happened to them. The three stars is due to an enjoyable last fifty pages."
4,What an incredibly helpful book!,"The book does a really good job of telling parents about some of the best public schools in NYC. The author also lets you know about the differences in philosophies, facilities and programs, to help figure out what would be best for your child. I hope it gets updated soon!"
1,Terrible,"The writers try to build a convincing case, and do that with lots of references. But adding lots of references doesn't make a good book.It's very easy to point out what is wrong from the sidelines, which is exactly what the writers do. No real alternatives are given, and those that are suggested are extremely expensive. If an air attack would cause 50 billion worth in damages, spending 40 billion is okay according to the writers.If you would want a book telling the Bush administration finds it difficult to tie their own shoes, look no further. This is the book you want.What decided me to trash this book was the opinion of the writers that not only Turkey should join the EU, but joining Egypt wouldn't be a bad idea either. A clear proof the writers have absolutely no idea whatsoever about Europe. I rarely throw away a brand new book (bought this last week), but this goes in the rubbish bin. Pathetic."
3,What went wrong,"I will be short and succinct in this review. The authors contend in this book that U.S. military interventions are jeopardizing the war against radical Islamists. They describe terrorists' use of the Internet to spread their ideology, the role of Christian evangelism in foreign policy, and the influence of Muslims in America.The authors also share their opinion that there have been no more attacks in the U.S.A. because of the easier targets given to the terrorist in Iraq. But believe that they will strike America again as they share the many failures in Homeland Security. This lack of security in the U.S.A. may be sobering, but sadly not surprising."
2,Weird Paris Guide Book,"After the Griffin & Sabine books, was looking for more of the same, but this one does not quite make it."
2,fun to read not very guide-able,"As an off-beat book that sems to be about Paris this was amusing but of limited value. The book is too cheeky and cute to serve as a useful guidebook. I felt lost on some entries - as if it was necessary to already be an insider to get the references made on some places.If I already knew Paris well, I might have appreciated this book. Don't know. But it did not seem to be very useful as a travelogue that I'd carry with me next time I trek over to the City of Light.A bit too wayward, and not enough of a guide. Beautifully typeset, I might add, which means a lot to me, But not sufficient for me to keep it and pop it in the laptop's carrying case."
4,Juice MAshine,"I bought this for my 5 yr old nephew. He is in love with it! The toy arrived only about 2 days after we ordered it and it wasn't supposed to arrive till about a week later. Very easy to use, just read the directions :)"
3,this was a gift,"We got this as a gift for my dad, he loves steele drum bands. When we found this we were very excited, it arrived impressively fast. We were surprised at how small it is and it is very delicately balanced on the stand. I realize it may have been intended for display only but we were under the impression that it was to learn how to play. My father likes it and since we don't have $600 or more for a big one it worked out fine."
4,Heavy and serious history,Heavy as in full of meat and flavor. This is a book that will make you change the way you think about slavery. It was worse than imagined.
2,Disappointing,"This could have been a really riveting book, had the author let the facts speak for themselves. It is clearly well researched and filled with compelling statistics and personal stories. Unfortunately, the author tries to do the reader's thinking for him, and in so doing, his agenda smothers his objective."
2,Dreary and Boring,"I was looking forward so very much to reading this book. There has to be a lot of material out there to put together an interesting history on the Slave Trade. However, I think I will have to look elsewhere as this book was a hard slog to get through. My attention wavered constantly as page after page read the same. I don't dispute the author's facts, apart from being slightly skewed against whites, but the way he put it all together didn't make this book a page turner at all. It was a good lesson on how to make an interesting and important topic boring."
2,Interesting topic but very dry and pretentious writing style,"As important as the topic of slavery is to America's shameful historical past, I found this book a particularly dry read. The facts are there and the subject was of great interest. I just wish however that the author had used a more accessible writing style. I slogged my way through to the end of the book; but it was was certainly not a page turner. Rather it was almost an excruciating task. I read many books on history and especially American history. What could have been a fascinating book was for me one of the most boring reads on the subject."
2,Another book on slavery.,"Though many have lauded this book, it seems to me that his argument is that slavery was bad. He makes some interesting points about how the market effected the character of slavery, but I ultimately found it tedious."
2,Disappointing Read,"Slavery in our country's history was grievously wrong, wrong, wrong...but this book was dry, dry, dry. It left out very basic details and was bogged down in the author's repetitive, plodding musings. My mind would drift trying to get through one paragraph (and the paragraphs are quite wordy.) I wanted to soak up this book and its information. Unfortunately, it was just too dull and overwrought, and I came away knowing merely a bit more about the New Orleans slave market than I did going in."
4,Very good,"This book looks into the slave trade in the American South and explores each slave as an individual, not as commodities. This book elaborates on the motivations of the slaves and slave traders during the time of forced servitude before the Civil War."
1,This is a kid's book?,"It says ages 4-8 for this book. Here are just two of the many non-4-8 year old quotes contained in this book:""And then, attack! Suddenly, the shark charges the cage. Its mouth is open, its rows of teeth bloody and bared. The diver waits, helpless.""""The jaws of the white shark are so strong, they can bite a person in half.""Sweet dreams little Billy - don't have nightmares about that big shark with its rows of bloody bared teeth biting you in half!"
3,Authoritative referemce that needed editing,"Useful for the reader, like myself, who knows nothing about handguns. But wordy, poorly organized, and assumes knowledge of guns (&gun acronyms) that novice readers don't possess. Still, this is apparently the only up-to-date reference available on all aspects of handgun ownership, so worth owning for that reason."
1,Busted the 2nd time it was used. Junk!,"1st project: Sewed 4 sheer curtains and all was fine. 2nd Project: Hemmed 4 cotton valances, it stopped feeding the fabric, called Brother they said to take it to a repair center in a town of 2,000 people an hour away, then go back a week later to pay for the repairs and pick up the machine. Why would anyone take two 1/2 days off of work and pay to repair a sewing machine that breaks so easily? The same is true for all Brother products. So I've learned to buy from companies that locate their service center in convenient locations, like the city of 500,000 that I live in."
2,Great... when it works,"EXTENSIVE bobbin problems, thread tension problems, etc. I've had this sewing machine for years and have never been able to do much with it because of all the problems I've had. They tell you to go get it serviced, but that costs just as much as getting a new crappy sewing machine.When it actually works, it's simple and easy, but multiple pieces randomly stop working all the time and if you are not very experienced with sewing machines you will never know how to fix it- the manual doesn't help at all.I plan to buy a new sewing machine soon; I'll be dumping this one on craigslist."
1,Horrible.,"Cheaply made and difficult to use! The threading mechanism is cumbersome; it requires a pair of tweezers since the movable arm does not come high enough to get the thread in. This is either a defect of this particular machine, or the entire model. The sewing thread and bobbin thread often tangle and jam up the machine, making a simple mending job into a mess. I have tried adjusting tension but there is no remedy to this situation. I do NOT recommend this machine."
2,"Started out strong, but failed in the end","I thought I was getting myself a real gem based on reviews I'd read, unfortunately I was wrong. I have owned this machine for just under 2 mos and it's already having issues w/the lower bobbin. I called Brother and though helpful w/troubleshooting, we couldn't fix the problem and I was instructed to take it to the closest service center which unfortunately is 36 miles away...would not really recommend this machine based on this experience."
5,Easy to Use,"Even though I worked as a seamstress in the Navy for about a year, I cannot really say that I am trained as a seamstress. I hemmed pants, added patches, and created (on an embroidery machine) patches then sewed them on uniforms, but that is really all basic stuff. I did learn how to control a really powerful sewing machine.It's been over seven years since I used a sewing machine but the Brother LS2125 25-Stitch Function Free Arm Sewing Machine was relativly easy to set up and is easy to use."
3,Ok but keeps tangling....and catching,"I was excited about this machine after reading some great reviews. It worked as I expected, not great with heavy materials but I wasn't expecting it to anyways. Great little machine but somehow the thread keeps catching on the rotating inner arm.... no where near where the thread is it is almost like the tension wheel is giving out and the thread is bouncing and catching or something. I have adjusted the tension etc and no luck. when it catches you cannot even move the needle. You have to unscrew the front plate of the machine and sit there with tweezers and a stitch ripper trying to pick the thread out and it is VERY time consuming. I was not very impressed to say the least. I will be taking mine back and getting a different machine as this is too much of a hassle and I have read that other people are having the same problem. Just a heads up."
1,Fell Apart and no warranty support,"I received an LS-2125 as a gift from my daughter and was initially very pleased. Until I tried to use it to sew a button hole in a shirt. I had to adjust the button hole stitch but when I touched the adjustment knob, it fell out of the machine (it is plastic. why companies use plastic for machined parts escapes me).I contacted the company for warranty service and they informed me I would have to ship it in at my expense and pay for return shipping and any repair work that is performed...this is MORE than the cost of the machine.I also got the distinct impression from both the customer service folks at Brother & the nearest authorized service center (which is over 70 miles away) that I got what I deserved for buying their low end machine. The service center owner said he would be glad to sell me a machine that is reliable and works...sooooo let this be a warning! Do Not Buy Brother Sewing Machines!"
5,Great first sewing machine,"I bought this sewing machine after doing much research on the internet and through my local Singer dealer. All the ""toy"" plastic machines are just that, toys. They do not hold up and end up frustrating the new sewer because they do not work long. This machine was easy to use and had all the basic stitches so that my 7 year old granddaughter was thrilled and able to thread it and sew right away! The only thing that these sewing machines made for children do is provide fun, easy sewing projects. With scrap fabric and a little bit of time, you can come up with these easy first projects. The machine is sturdy and could last her for years and years. It cost just a little more than the toys and I highly recommend!"
3,Nice little sewing machine,I purchased this machine as a starter for my nieces who had never used one before. I didn't want to invest a lot of money until I knew if they would stick with it. This machine has served its purposes well. It was easy to understand the manual and has plenty of features for a beginner. I'm now considering buying another so each can have their own.
2,Not so great,This machine worked well at first on really simple stuff but is not good for the long haul or anything more complex. The thread becomes a rats nest on the bottom and messing with the tension can take years! This is great if you will always use thin fabric and sew in straight lines.
4,A Pleasant Surprise!,"I thought this was going to be terrible, but it isn't. In fact, it is a solid blues rock effort. Tyler's vocals are in top form as they morph to fit each blues classic and you just have to hear the guitar work for yourself. Definitely not for blues purists, but you will dig it if blues rock is your bag. The boys from Boston have brewed up a batch of blues rock bliss!"
5,Execellant !!,"The best Aerosmith in years. Maybe they just took a break from all the top forty ambitions and record company demands to pay respect to the blues? I don't know? But I do know that this is a pure, honest album thats not over produced. You can sense that they enjoyed doing this and I for one am glad that they did. It restores my faith in a band that I started listening to back in the days of ""toys in the attic"" and ""rocks""."
4,Aerosimth on Blues,"Aerosmith did a fine job on this CD,these guys are no stranger to Blues,one song comes to mind is ""the big ten inch"".I give this CD a Thumb up."
3,What's with the name?,"Aerosmith doing the blues. Not a bad idea, not a bad CD. The boys do a pretty good job on the covers. But if you want real blues, buy a Buddy Guy CD, or a Feddie King CD, or a Albert Collins CD. The Grind is a pretty good song, not really blues, but catchy."
3,I like this but......,"I like Aerosmith but this sounds a bit produced (like what doesnt, sorry guys) . If the Stones did these songs it would sound like you were in the room with the band. No frills. I wish the Stones would do an all blues album. The Stones did some blues songs at times. Time for more."
5,As Good As It Gets!,"I am a diehard Aerosmith fan and I think that this ranks right up there with all of their best work. Every single track is great to listen to over and over again. The harmonica sound is terrific and I love Joe Perry in ""Back, Back Train"". This is definately one CD that will spend alot of time in my player."
5,One of my 3 favorite AEROSMITH albums. So blues-y but still rock. Love it!,"Honkin On Bobo is one of my favorite Aerosmith CDs (and I have a LOT of Aerosmith CDs).So blues-y but still Rock. Sounds like old time Aerosmith.In my humble opinion Aerosmith shares the title of Best Band EVER with Led Zeppelin, AND they are STILL making sweeet music with all original members present & rockin out!I just got my copy of the brand new CD that was released a few days ago. MUSIC FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION. All NEW Aerosmith rock and roll songs! I've only had time to listen through twice but already love a lot of the songs."
2,"HONK, IF YOU'RE A BOZO...","...and you think this is music. if you have spent any time or money on this band, since the mid 1970's, congratulations you are a bobo. its been soo long since they did anything worth listening to, even the Stone Temple Pilots laugh at them. whats with the extra star you ask? well, i'll say this- at least Steven and Joe have aged better than Mick and Keith."
2,run of the mill but better than there past decade stuff,Aerosmith was a Band that I use to dig before they got so predictable to the point they were just going through the Motions.this album is a Blues Cover Album which is suppose to showcase them.it has soem decent runs but is lacking soul&the Production just seems kinda there.after a while like with Eric clapton's Robert Johnson cover album you just are ready to go onto something else.
2,No soul on this one!,"I'm a big Aerosmith fan. I love these guys and I have almost all of their releases, but this Honkin'on Bobo, I have to say, is not good. Lack of soul, lack of seriousness. It seems they are playing just for the fun of it. Some songs really seem to be out of tune! No, sorry, but this is not the Aerosmith I'm used to. ""Never loved a girl"" is the only good cover performance, and ""The grind"", the only song written by the band, is just ok. But the rest of the CD is drowning in the sea of frailty! I didn't like it, and if you are a conservative of the Music Party, you probably won't like it either!"
1,Pseudo Blues from pseudo band,"This band should have packed it in after 1977. Possibly the most overrated band in the history of bands. Not only is it bad, it's downright irritating. Steven Tyler is an extremely bad joke gone on way past it's prime."
2,"Can you say ""Gravy Train?""","It's too bad a once good band like Aerosmith has to resort to covering old songs to keep their fading career going. The music is not bad, but c'mon...artists are supposed to be original. AC/DC covered the song ""Baby Please Don't Go"" back in 1974. You are 30 years too late Aerosmith. The AC/DC version and the original Big Joe Williams version are superior. If you're a die-hard Aerosmith fan I guess you'll like this...if not - stay away, far away."
1,...oh lord...,"When this thing came out I had just recently gotten into Aerosmith, and to my luck my local library had all of their 70's albums just sitting for me to plunder to my hearts content. Then this thing came out and I remember reading how it was going to be some sort of return to the blues days or whatever they were peddling it as. Not only is it bad, but is completely uninspired too. I can't even commend them for a good effort, because so little effort seems to have been put into this. Their debut up until Draw The Line is where I similarly draw the line with interest in their catalog."
1,"Sorry to say, Aerosmith laid an egg with this one.","I saw from (some of) the other 164 reviews (so far) that this was reviewed very positively. All I can say is it did absolutely nothing for me. I LIKE the band, so I'm not trying to dog them. I saw them as far back as Cal Jam II (with Foreigner, Heart, Nugent, etc), and have 15 of their albums going back to 1973, but this is the first (and hopefully ONLY) one that doesn't even have one good track. It's just boring. I won't argue with the many others who like it; I'll just say it's not for me. If you're new to Aerosmith and like them, I'd suggest you get the album ""Rocks"" or ""Toys in the Attic"" instead of this one (for early albums) or ""Pump"" or ""Get a Grip"" (later albums). This just isn't that same polished hard rock I knew and liked and expected from the guys. Again, the BAND is hot, no question, but this specific album is a dud."
2,"Love the band, hate this CD","I've been a huge Aerosmith fan since the mid-80s. I've loved every CD they've put out since ""Permanent Vacation."" (Okay, I take that back. I only half-loved ""Nine Lives."")But I'm really not a blues fan, and I just couldn't get into this CD at all. Make no mistake, if you're not a blues fan, you probably won't like this album.Here's hoping they come out with another CD of original Aerosmith material sometime soon..."
1,Yuk,"This Cd stinks of a 7 day old corpse. Its old songs redone, nothing new. Why cant Aerosmith write 14 or so new songs and realese them, is their creativity shot or what. Dont buy this cd it is awlful."
2,UNORIGINAL,"I so much wanted this to be a great album. What a wasted opportunity. Aerosmith has never been subtle, but subtlety is just what they needed here. You want to hear a great blues CD get Boz Scagg's homage to the great ones ""Come On Home"". Get ""Toys"" or ""Rocks"" if you want a great Arerosmith CD. ""Honkin on Bobo"" is an overinflated, overproduced, Rock Album wanting to be the Blues. Sounds like every other Aerosmith album done since the late 1970's. Nothing original here."
1,Less than 1 star- perhaps a quasar,"This new Aerosmith platter is one huge heaping pile of dog-doo. I feel completely ripped off by a band that I used to absotutely looooove. No imagination ventured, nothing gained by owning this crap. Stay away. Don't even buy used. If you get this fecal matter for a present, discard in the biohazardous waste bin with the used needles and jimmy caps. Dammit, Stevie-boy, how many facelifts will it take for you to start writing some quality material again? Apparently all those 'Ludes and Mary-Jane tokes back in the 70's did cause some brain damage after all. And Joseph Perry, how could you let your good name be associated with such excrement? I would expect it from Whitford, but not YOU- of the Toxic Twins!!! This music is so obsolete it makes me retch. For God's sake please listen to some Led Zep albums and get back to me in 2 years. We'll keep the light on for ya!-David J Newman 2004"
2,less would have been more,"This is about as much a blues disc as the latest Britney Spears disc. Aerosmith took a bunch of already over-recorded songs and literally beat them to death. Pounding drums, wailing guitars, screechy vocals - to say it's over produced would be putting it politely. They should have gotten a producer that is familiar with the blues to show them that not every disc has to have songs tailor made for arenas. With so many good REAL blues musicians out there having their recordings virtually ignored, the publicity these guys are getting should be a crime."
4,Excellent CD!,"""Honkin' on Bobo"" is one of the most exciting, fun disks I've heard in a long time. It's hard driving good ol' rock and roll that will get your foot to tapping everytime. You can tell the band was having a rollicking good time as they were making this music.If you're a blues purist who only likes to listen to the original artists, you may not like this CD because it's way more hard rock than blues. I happen to be a fan of both genres.I like this Aerosmith music even better than their classics of 25-30 years ago. You'll never hear any of these songs on hit radio- maybe that's why I like it so much."
5,Back to the Roots !!,"Remember ""Rocks""...""Toys in the Attic""...""Night in The Ruts"" and ""Done with Mirrors"" ? This new album bring back the stage ""rock n' roll"" that make the Aerosmith one of the best rock n' roll bands of the 70's and 80's !!The ""punch"" returns with good melodies and rock guitars making this album one of the best surprises of 2004 !Special attention for Joey Kramer...plays better than ever !!BUY NOW !!"
5,EXCELLENT!,I love Aerosmith so anything they put out I would love but this is one of their best albums!
5,CLASSIC AEROSMITH,"THE GUYS ARE AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME WITH THIS ONE.AFTER 30+ YEARS THE TOXIC TWINS SOUND BETTER THAN EVER.THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BANDS OF ALL TIME,NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.I'M JUST HAPPY THAT I WAS PART OF IT."
3,Don't Get Me Started...,"These guys haven't made an honest effort at making music in over 20 years; They sold out and started making ""product"" instead. Now, after all these years, they decide to make a real rock 'n' roll CD, and it's decided during the mastering process to crank the volume so high that the peaks clip and the overall sound becomes very compressed! I have a volume control, so why do they feel a need to do this? This band can't win for losing."
2,Great Album Title / Lousy CD,"Aerosmith's idea to do a Blue's flavored album was a great one, nice package, catchy Album title, but then the music doesn't deliver. The first four tracks are decent, but after that it just goes downhill. Not enough variety in the style's of songs, and the vocals aren't as bluesy as they could be. I love the title ""Honkin on Bobo"" just not enough of it, ('bobo' the harmonica that is), to make this CD worth picking up."
1,not worth it,"this aerosmith album is just another way to generate money. It sounds contrived without real emotion. Sure, the bobo is bluesaerosmith style, buttttt it is very mechanically performed. Themajority of the songs are pure filler which would be okay as a cover in several cds. Their true blues-rock songs are still from the 1970s bar none. It tries to recreate their 70s style without the hunger which they just don't have anymore."
1,Aerosmith Getting Back to Their Roots?,"I was very disapointed with their attempt at producing a Blues album. I love their usual music for what it's worth (pop-rock), and I know that they could do Blues if they really put their heart and soul into it, but,just like Jonny Lang's new album...,they didn't. I don't think that is showing much respect for their customer's intelligence to try to push this garbage off as Blues music. It is an insult to the Blues industry. Even the little harmonica on the keychain was not of the right key."
2,Another great band bites it...,"What a lazy, half-hearted, boredom-driven, self-serving pile of aerocrap. I LOVE Aerosmith and have seen them in concert no less than 9 times in different cities. They are the Gods of arena rock, having written some of the greatest rock classics of all time. But this album was just ridiculous. I'm not sure who's worse, Clapton's ME AND MR JOHNSON or HONKIN ON BOBO. Buy ANY other Aerosmith CD and be blown away. At least in Aerosmith's case, you don't have to go back to the sixties or early seventies to find it."
5,The boys are back!!!!!!!!,This is exactly what rock and roll needed...real blues/rock to shake rattle and roll off the funeral durges that pass as rock today. Want to remember how much fun and visceral rock can be? Pick this puppy up.This is the best rock album that I have heard in five years.12 out of 10 stars.
4,Aerosmith sing and play the blues!,"This album doesn't rock as hard as Aerosmith's predecessors. They do an excellent cover of BABY PLEASE DON'T GO,which was a hit in the 60's for Them,who originally recorded it. That was Van Morrison taking the lead on the original recording just several years before going on his own. This album is so bluesy that they should have had guest artists like Eric Clapton,B.B. King and Ray Charles,who died shortly after this album was released. It's a cool album,though."
4,honking on bobo,"Honking on Bobo, from Aerosmith has turned out to be a relatively good Album. Aerosmith used its blues roots and pulled out yet another Chapter in the Aerosmith saga. It is a little disapointing that it is not the Aerosmith that we all have come to know and love. As, with Aerosmith the older music is what will always be the best.But non the less the album does hold power and some amazing tunes that are so easy to relate to and to understand. This album is a definet must for any Aerosmith fan and will definalty be an album to remeber."
4,Glad this album came out!,"This is a pretty cool album if you are into the blues and Aerosmith. I think that ""classic Aerosmith"" fans and hard-core blues fans could possibly be disapointed though. Not that they don't do the songs justice. The truth is that this album comes from the heart of the band. They didn't record this album to make money, they recorded it because they love the blues and they wanted to do it Aerosmith style.Honestly, the best part of ""Honkin"" for me was the only orignal on the album, ""The Grind."" It kicks serious [...].The only problem I had with the album is that there isn't enough soloing. I would of liked to hear a Perry improvised blues riff."
4,Its about time,"This is the best Aerosmith album since pump. It's everything you would expext Aerosmith to sound like in a blues format. What there blues lacks in pain it makes up for it with sincere sleaze. I can't wait to here Baby please don't go live. I have the same complaint that I've had about all the modern Aerosmith albums, THE GUITARS NEED TO BE LOUDER IN THE MIX."
4,"Blues-Rock, that is","I think it is funny that the record company and the band promoted this as a Blues record prior to its release. This is a blues record only in the sense that Disraeli Gears by Cream or Beck-Ola are blues records.Honkin on Bobo is a Blooze-Rock record that Rocks with a capital R and would not have been out of place in the early 70's. This is a stunning return to rock and roll form for a band that has made way too many trips to the power-ballad ATM in recent years. Keep it coming guys, I love it."
5,Too bad I can't give it more than 5!,"I give it five stars, two thumbs up, and three snaps in a ""z"" formation! This album is like a musical ""O"". I have been anxiously awaiting this album for years - long before they announced they were going to record it. I am a die-hard Aerosmith fan, and it does my heart good to hear the Boys from Boston lay it down like only they can. Fantastic riffs, smokin' vocals, driving rhythms. Tyler's voice is a perfect, sultry, gritty match for the blues. They have written several of their own songs, covered a couple of famous ones, and given the blues in general a whole new fresh Aerosmith spin. They returned to their roots and cranked out a great album. I think this could be their greatest effort since ""Toys"". (And the harmonica key chain really plays!) Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the Aerosmith you have been waiting for!"
2,Ladies and germs....AeroZzzzzzzzzzz,"From the opening announcement of ""Ladies and gentlemen..."" I had a sinking feeling about this album. That intro sounds like it was the tenth or eleventh take and, thus, loses all of the spontaneity it was meant to convey. I've listened to ""Honkin'"" several times and I just don't love it. Being picky about album artwork, I have to mention that the Photoshop-enhanced cover of the CD looks really fake. Why couldn't they have real lipstick on that harmonica from a real woman's real lips? That might've been cool. Might've been. Anyway, there are some good songs (or good PARTS of songs) on here, but overall it fails to impress me much. I was kina hopin' for an album that sounded more like their 1973 debut (my personal favorite), but this sounds like all the other overproduced, modern releases by Aerosmith and I just don't buy that these guys are REALLY having fun anymore."
3,where is the harmonica?,"Even my kids were too young for Arrowsmith, still there is nothing like great music from wherever it comes from....the jacket suggests thre is a harmonica here, somewhere, if you can get past the high energy of the cd to hear what appears to be a featured part of the album, the harmonica.."
1,about the worst cd ive come across,"Drunk guy blues music, not even close to rock. This band worst album to date. They used to experiment with new styles, and be cutting edge, but this is washed up music that was popular in the late 70's"
1,The Worst Ever,"This is whithout a doubt the worst CD i have ever heard. I know these guys are major sellouts but to rip off someone elses music, and then make it sound so bad, it should be illegal. With Creed and Phish breaking up i was happy but if Aerosmith could go, i would then see God's work, and know for sure he is out there."
2,not old school,"Spare me the ""old school"" ravings of this album. This is the same glossy Aerosmith that arrived with ""Permanent Vacation"" and no older than that. If you like that style, this album is fine. To me, it comes no where close to exploring the depths and talents of this band, it is merely more bubble gum rock, over the top and far away from that great rythm and blues band that gave us ""Get Your Wings"", ""Toys in the Attic"" and especially their first self titled album. Old School Aerosmith fans, do not get your hopes up, nothing has changed."
2,"Pendantic, and that's A Bad Thing.","The author seems to think that if a job cannot be done efficiently using a certain programming style, then the programmer is a bad person for wanting to do that problem.If, on the other hand, you work for a living and want useful information and not condescending attitude, try the books by Adams and Brainerd."
2,Poor Intro to Fortran book,Positives- Has all the neccesary information to begin programming in FORTRAN.Negatives- Too much text to for explaining such a simple programming language. Examples are incomplete and useless. Not a good reference text. I suggest using Intro to FORTRAN 90 for Engineers and Scientist by Larry Nyhoff.
5,"Good plot, deep characters",I thought this book was good because of the way Mr. Ishiguru developed the story of a self-diluting butler that doesn't want to face the fact that his employer was a really bad guy. I was impressed that he made an otherwise uneventful butlers life into a story epitomizing how people fail to see the truth of what was directly in front of his face.
3,Confusing,I was waiting for what i thought were to happen but the main character just throws away the oppourtunity! It is also a confusing book to follow so it was very unappealing to me. I only read it cause i had to for my english class.
4,Different kind of book,It is told in the first person about the life of a excellent butler. It really made me think of my work ethic. It should be the same today. It is also about interpersonal relationships with family and people we work with and how respectful we are of them and our bosses.
5,It was the Butler,"Ishiguro masterfully uncovers the life of Stevens, a prudish butler, who is as strait-laced and bitchy as they come. Stevens lives comfortably sheltered from responsibility while his every decision is regulated by the rules of aristocratic England, until World War II shakes up the aristocracy, making his world obsolete. No longer able to let rules of propriety guide his every decision and relationship, he fondly recalls the golden days of his prime, when he passed over all chances for intimacy with a cold-hearted precision that is all the pride and glory left him in the remains of the day.Ishiguro's portrait of a cold-hearted man of duty is beautiful and touching, even when it ought to feel chilling. He offsets Stevens with the one possible romance of the butler's past, Miss Kensington, who opts in the end for a harshly imperfect love."
3,umm...,the book came fast. it was in pretty good condition. i haven't been able to read it yet tho. but i hear it is a really good book! so im kinda excited about reading it when i get the chance.
2,Like Watching Dust Settle on My Grandmother's Finest China,"There is a reason why there are so few books written about the lives of butlers: they're BORING! Indeed, half-way through and I think I shall retire this book in favor of re-organizing my linen closet."
2,"good literature, annoying story","If you read for fun, don't read it. Really, the man's only talking about himself. bla bla bla. The story is confusing, the butler reminds everything so disordently, ah."
5,Beautiful,This book has a dreamlike quality as the narrator drifts easily through time with the tides of his memory. The story is masterfully subtle and most of the story is told between the lines. Haunting.
3,"Subtle, subdued, like a slow car drive through the country","This is one of those books that doesn't blow you away with a sensational story, shocking plot twists, or edge of your seat suspense. It's not that kind of book. I almost wish it was an assigned book for a class or for my book club so I'd have someone to talk about it with because I think it would prove to be much more rewarding that way. Unfortunately, I don't have that luxury, so I am forced to just take away from it what I can, which is that this book is rich in character, but somehow lacking in something that I can't quite put my finger on. It reads like an old classic, or something akin to Gosford Park in terms of modern adaptations of the comedy of manners theme. I would recommend it, though, but only guardedly, with friends who are interested in Victorian novels (because that's how it feels)."
4,"this is an excellent book, but...","...why on earth a reader thinks this has anything to do with Japan or Japanese culture is beyond me. If the author did not have a Japanese name, that would never be said. Ishiguro has lived in the UK all his life, and was raised there from the age of five. There is not one word about Japan or Japanese culture in the entire novel.This is a wonderful - and thoroughly English - book about the distortions of memory, the burdens and joys of duty, and about love and lost opportunity."
5,A Love Story,"I have not read all the other reviews; just some of them. They are very accurate in analising the plot and the historical backgrounds, but the ones I've read forget to say one very special little thing.First, let me say that, of course, there is a socio-political dimension in the book - every good book carries one - but that is not, by far, the most important thing about it.But those who perceive the book only by its ""class struggle""* and historical dimensions have fallen, I think, into a subtle trap: Remains of the Day is, indeed, a love story.______________________________________________________________________*It is time we are done with that, isn't it?"
4,"Great book, different from movie","I am writing to refute another user's comment that the book was ""very faithful to the movie."" The book preceded the movie, and therefore was not in a position to be ""faithful to the movie."" Second, the book and the movie are quite different. The most major difference is that the movie conflates Mr. Farraday and Mr. Lewis into one character. The movie has Stevens serving Mr. Lewis, who is supposed to be the same man who attended the conference years earlier. There are numerous other smaller differences (such as the names of the Jewish girls and that in the movie they are refugees), but to say that the movie is a faithful representation of the book is simply inaccurate."
1,Classic example of the desperation to find a modern classic,This book was abominably boring and pretentious. The protagonist was about as much fun as a roll of sandpaper Charmin. AP English classes every year are being forced to read this mind-numbing drivel. It must stop!
4,A great trip through time......,"Take a trip to the English side with a beautiful and entertaining novel. Love is truly there, but let's say in a very English way....If you are looking for a good read this Spring I could not recommend a better book."
5,Prisoners of our own personality,"Most writers are taught to tell stories about characters who change. This book is the most beautiful and heartbreaking story of a character who cannot change. Ishigura brings us deep into the heart of a man, a butler, who is tragically set in his ways to the point that he forsakes both family and true love. It leaves us begging the question about ourselves: What faults in our characters cause us to overlook happiness and responsibility in our lives"
5,Thought-provoking,"This book deserved its Brooker Prize (and more). Take a well-written, understated story of a butler adjusting to a new (American) gentleman, put the butler on his first road trip, have the memory of his butler-father intermingle with his trying to make sense of his new world - you get this thought-provoking tale. What are the limits of professionalism and loyalty? How does one maintain these qualities in a world in which their definitions appear to be changing? How does one admit to themselves that clinging to old ways leave one unable to read correctly present situations much less respond correctly? These questions are explored in a tale of grace and humor. Recommended."
4,A Masterly Work,"This is the first novel I have read of Kazuo Ishiguro and I could not resist sighing reading the beautiful prose. The portrayal of the butler, his detached restraint and attempts to be the epitome of ""dignity"" throughout his career-- while extraneous circumstances sway his ideals and the gradual overwhelming realization of the barrenness of his tenuous beliefs, marked by the ultimate realization of a life wasted, transform the novel into a mesmerizing psychoanalysis of man's feeble relationship between his self and what he projects. Amidst the ruins of a fading empire and ways of living, hope still persists of a beautiful ""evening"" of life. Marvellous."
3,A Perfect English Butler lacks a true sense of pathos.,"After reading the reviews here and seeing the movie, I boughtthe book with a great sense of anticipation. The plot: a reviewof the life of a perfect English butler who has the twilightof his years to look forward to. Perhaps the movie gave toomuch away, but I did not find the book amongst the more engrossingthat I have read. The last five pages are the only oneswhere I got a sense of the pathos of the character. Read ""ThePostman"" instead and see what I mean."
5,Fantastic--even better after you've seen the movie!,"Usually, movies and novels don't mix. If one is poignant and relevant, the other is utter crap. In the case of The Remains of the Day, though, this is definitely not true: the movie actually *enhances* the book, and vice versa.This novel takes place in post-WWII England, laden with pre-WWII flashbacks. The story of Stevens, the obedient butler of Lord Darlington, is not for the action-adventure lover: it is a quiet, almost meditative story that contemplates love, war, obedience, the working class, and patriotism. The story is slow but rich; if you liked The English Patient or Schindler's List, you will enjoy this book.I had seen the movie several times before I settled into the novel; I have found that it's especially pleasant if you can hear Stevens in your mind in the voice of Anthony Hopkins."
2,"More than likely, a millstone.","The rating is not for the music--all of the tracks are classic 1940s Bird sessions with Miles on board, so the music is unequalled even when it has to compete with grating surface noise. But this is another of those European misrepresentations that spikes sales and suckers the unwary consumer by using the same title as a more famous and popular recording by the artist. Having recently wasted my money on a similar ""impersonation"" of a cherished session (Sinatra's ""Close to You""), I'm learning to read the fine print.In not so fine print, incidentally, is the manufacturer's flagrantly false claim of ""High Quality Sound."""
1,terrible sounding collections,This is the worst sounding Donny Osmond collection I've heard. You are better off getting either of the other compilations put out on the Curb label. This cd sounds overly bright and shrill.
3,Great- but all the Old albums are available on CD now!,I bought this prior to the release of the two-for albums. I no longer need this one.
1,CD Scratchy,"The CD was very scratch. The music sound like it was not very clear,would not buy it again. Would sent it back for got to."
3,"Roy Walker says ""Its good but its not right""","Its not a bad album at all but i think its missing something, the songs are too repetative and aren't diverse enough to make you want to keep listening to it. Not bad as background music but could do a lot better."
1,I would have given it 0 stars if it was an option.,"This is actually the worst book on networking I have ever read. It does not live up to the claims on the cover in any way. Either the author goes into tedious detail on trivial points or he skims lightly over more important ones. In no way does this book tie together the concepts and present the design of a real network. If you want disjointed, detailed descriptions of smallest pieces of a network, this is your book. However, this book will not describe how all of the pieces of the puzzle fit together."
1,The Networking Handbook,"Save your Money... Of the over 200 books I have studied on networking I must say that this book is the most disappointing of any book I have ever seen.Ed, Save a tree put your hundreds of pages of protocol analysis recordings on the CD-ROM and please give us Timely, searchable and up to date RFCs not just a copy of the RFCs form the FTP site. Give us some Value added !"
4,Great Reference,I bought the book to use as a reference and found it extremely helpful. My work requires reference material and this is one of the books I have.
2,strictly collectible,"well its bad brains,and its live. the mix doesent come close to the fatness of""youth are getting restless""live. and h.r. just sounds mental and drugged out, spewing incoherent babble in between jams most of the set. where is the energy? it sounds like an off night. but if you love the band,it certainly belongs in the collection. maybe if i just got really out of my head hammered,i would be right there with h.r.and it would all make sense. i highly recommend ""the youth are getting restless"" live in amsterdam 87. it crushes all over this one...peace"
5,"i disagree completely! recording, hr, energy ARE PHAT!","I was there, too!Listen for yourself. Dr Know is playing perfectly. Hr is jovial and singing like on Black Dots. Darryl mixed the record as only the bass player could (this is normally a Reggae label-so you think they can record bass tones?). Earl is a god with drumsticks. I've seen this band 5 times, in all, and onless u have an early 9:30 Club show, you have here a winner. makes the major release St. Germaine recording sound like a toss off."
3,not the best but..,"im being a bad brains fan since 1996 i liken them very much. but this album is not so very good HR sounds if he had taken a coup` or something he sounds very depresed and bored when he sings, and its all slowdon very much, and my favourite song isnt in it Let Me Help and jah love. the good thing is that it sounds spaced out and thnigs like that. i like his ep rock of enoch better br HR-solo band / peace out Ras TafarI"
4,Don't know of anything like it!,"There are many well-written books on the history of mathematics. They differ in structure, focus, and target audience, but they essentially cover the same material as each other. This is the only pop book I found on the history of statistics.I teach a high school algebra and statistics class, and I have my students do biographies of mathematicians. People like John Graunt, Adolphe Quetelet, and Florence Nightengale, who may get brief mentions in other books, find the spotlight on them and their lives' work in this book. Because of this project, I have become familiar with the body of mathematical historical and biographical literature, and I have not come across anything that remotely shares the focus of TRIUMPH OF NUMBERS.As we move to the increasingly data-driven society outlined in Ian Ayres' SUPERCRUNCHERS. I. B. Cohen has written an important book by outlining of the development of data analysis."
1,"Absurd, bogus, bigoted,ridiculous and outdated","I'm an agronomist and I live in Brazil.I like to read books.I tried to read this trash-book, here in Brazil.About twenty years ago, an american lent this trash-book to me.This book is absurd, bogus, bigoted, ridiculous and outdated."
5,Perfessional,Best hammer head ever made. The handle will need to be replaced at some point and I suggust a hand crafted one to match the awsome'ness of the titanium head.
4,Fun to Swing,"After using this hammer every day for a few weeks, I don't ever want to pick up that famous blue handled hammer I used to swing! Despite the handle coming loose soon after I started using it, I still wouldn't give it up. (A quick call to the manufacturer and a new handle was on its way at no cost to me) The magnetic slot to start nails with is the envy of the rest of the crew at work. I thought it was kinda gimmicky at first but not anymore. This is a great product. I hope you find the review helpful in making the pricey investment."
5,Amazon & Caesars Man Are the Best,"I was extremely satisfied with both the service and the price I received by purchasing Caesars Man from Amazon.This is my favorite cologne and I cannot purchase it locally. I searched the internet and found the best price on Amazon.The cologne arrived in a very timely manner, in good shape, and I will continue ordering this excellent product from you."
5,Loved this fragrance for years!,"This cologne has been around quite a while, but has become difficult to find in local stores."
1,Let It Be On Whatever Shelf You See It On,"Not that my expectations were very high, but this volume in the series is a big disappointment. It often reads like a mere set list for the recording dates; and since Matteo offers very little analysis or insight, the useful information in the book could probably be boiled down to 10 of the small pages.Of the volumes in the series I've read, this is the only one that I consider disappointing. For the quality of writing and information, the best volumes are in my opinion and this order: Erik Davis on Led Zeppelin IV, Hugo Wilcken on David Bowie Low, Mark Pollizoti on Highway 61 Revisited, Bill Janowitz on Exile on Main Street, Andy Miller on the Kinks Are the Village Preservation Society. All of those are worth reading. Go elsewhere on the Beatles Let It Be."
3,Beatles' End,"Steve Matteo's entry into the 33 1/3 series is a solid, but fairly uninteresting account of the Beatles' last album and the Get Back sessions and documentary filming. The problem with writing a book about the Beatles is that it's all been said before and Mr. Matteo doesn't really offer any new insight into the sessions."
4,Not A Bad Read,"The 33 1/3 series is really a great idea, functionally however many of the books merely rehash old articles and interviews.The Let It Be volume, however is a noble attempt to bring together information from many sources about the recording of the album, the mood of the Beatles and their collaborators, a decent degree of technical information and the situation surrounding the album's initial shelving, it's place as the best band in the world's swan song, the re-release of the alternate version in 2003 and the upcoming re-release of the movie which has been under wraps for way too long. Definitely worth a read by any Beatles fan."
3,"Well, how much of a Beatles freak are you?","If you're a die-hard Beatles freak, you might not learn much from this, as the ""Get Back"" sessions are well-documented, both through official sources and the multitude of bootlegs from those sessions. If you're a novice fan wanting to know more about those sessions, this is a great introduction. Not too much personal opinion inserted, just a factual accounting of the sessions, much like the ""In Utero"" book. If you're a Beatles fanatic, chance are you've already got this book-if not, add it to your collection. Personally, I would've preferred another Beatles album (say, Revolver or Abbey Road) be given the 33 1/3 treatment."
3,good chronicle,"The author provides a good chronicle of *when* particular songs were recorded in various sessions, but he doesn't say a lot *about* the songs. I would have liked to have seen more about the themes and musical structures that the Beatles explored in the Let It Be and Abbey Road sessions that overlapped. Still, this is a good resource on these sessions."
1,Disappointing,"I have read several of the books in this excellent series, and I've been a Beatles fan since I was a very small child, so it's a bit hard for me to give this book a one-star review, but I have to. It's a huge disappointment. Yes, there are a couple of interesting anecdotes and funny stories, but the book's author seems to have been bridled by the need to somehow cover *everything* --and in doing so, his book is missing what the Beatles had in spades: heart."
3,does the job but not worth the price,"poor casting, poor paint job---half wasn't painted, handles falling off etc....paid too much even at half the price, not sure it would have been worth it"
4,Poor Casting Quality,"The press works great, but the quality of the casting is really poor....I would be ashamed to put my name on it if I was Shop Fox....I have some other tools of theirs and the quality is great. If they want to maintain their reputation as a great tool supplier they really need to have a look at the casting house they are using for this press....The really great thing about buying this press thru Amazon.com is the price, with the shipping, the press was at least $25 cheaper than anyone else..."
2,Don't Bother,"The plot concept in this book is interesting, but the execution falls flat. Blackthorn should have stuck to writing a political treatise if he wanted to share his ideas, instead of insulting the memory of a dead man by putting extremely unlikely words into his mouth.Blackthorn is not a very good writer. The action is stilted and sometimes confusing, the dialog isn't believable, and his metaphors are truly awful. The characters are one-dimensional, and the reader knows exactly what will happen at the end of the book from the very first page. It's cliched and almost boring.In short, if you're interested in the revolution and Cuba, read a biography of Che. If you want to hear a painful rendition of Blackthorn's political ideals (based on Plato and Thomas Jefferson's conception of the ""republic"") - don't bother even then. Read Plato and Jefferson and spare yourself this book."
1,Identity revealed,"The mysterious, ""internationally known,"" author of this novel is none other than Gary ""Monkey Business"" Hart, former Senator from Colorado. His warm regard for Che Guevara is typical of the fuzzy-minded generation which always thought that ""Dr. Castro's"" bloody tyranny would turn out well."
1,Skip this book,"Skip over this book if you are looking for a basic book of jewelry making techiniques. It does have a few pages of techniques but most of it some very odd jewelry, even sculpture, not anything the average person would want to make."
3,Salt and Pepper,"Salt and PepperI am going to tell you about the book Learning by Heart by Ronder Thomas Young. This book was about a white girl, named Rachel, living when blacks and whites did separate things. Her family has a maid, named Isabella, who teaches Rachel that it doesn't matter what color people's skin color is, but that you should be nice to everyone. I thought this book was okay. It's a little slow at the beginning but the exciting parts are closer to the end. All together I thought this book was good and it also had a good message to it."
4,Very helpful,"I use my JessEm router table a lot so the different sizes really help. However, they do not lock down as tightly as the original that came with the unit and they sometimes vibrate loose. Not much of a problem but very annoying."
5,Safety plus,I have needed this for a while. I am now able to use more bits more safely. The way they lock in is also particularly helpful. A must have to be safe and efficient.
3,falcon Dust-Off Disposable compressed gas duster 3.5 oz can,"product very handy for if you do not need a large size can when cleaning your elecronics (IE;computer,printers etc.)"
4,The Beauty of Self-Control,"This book is very rich in the material presented. The fact that it was written from a different time period made it at times difficult for me to grasp, but overall it was a wonderful book! A spiritual minded person with good understanding of how books were presented during that time period will enjoy this book!Sandy Woodruff"
5,Utterly fantastic,I must have been waiting for this book.... and I sincerely thank Mr Ardagh for his great service. A tremendously useful book for all who struggle with the evolutionary process. You will be comforted. You will be encouraged. You will see how normal the struggle is and..... that you are so not alone. We ALL struggle at some time and to some degree. We ALL suffer paradox :Onwards and upwards... great humanity... how DO we caringly live IN matter and at the same time live the Truth that ultimately nothing matters ?
2,Jump on the Hogwash Enlightenment Express!,"Soon to be a motion picture at your local IMAX theatre. :)A research project turned marketing exploit. The made-up words ""Iago trance"" and ""translucence"" are so pompous I had to laugh, still how does one name such things? I'm sure the poor author was only trying his best to convey. A fine attempt, if way to long and wordy. Maybe just a magazine article instead of a thesis?I expect more and more of this type of book to be coming out, to all our entertainment or lack of."
2,Borrowed wisdom & alot of mindstuff,Much of it just didn't ring true.Keep it simple with Eckhart Tolle or Ramana Maharshi & there might not be a personality left to be translucent.
4,Amazing Compedium of Advanced Wisdom,"Ardagh has done us a great service in bringing together the wisdom of many of the people whose ideas will rule the world in this century, if we have any future at all. One star withheld for the difficulty of the typefaces used, both of which bid fair to send you blind in any light less than optimal."
2,Superficial Vanity Press,"There's nothing in this book that could not be learned during one hour net-surfing the more mundane, hum-drum satsang sites on offer.Nick ""Arjuna"" Ardagh is first and foremost a new-age entrepreneur not a true spiritual writer.His latest book reads like piece of vanity marketing for those quoted. However, it fails to go anywhere but to the superficial which is exactly what we don't need.Arjuna is reasonable at spotting conceptual trends but is not sio able to follow them to their conclusion i.e real freedom. Just see any of his video presentations over the past few years. This book is any no-brainer with little practical value.I'd recommend any books by Lee Lozowick, Adi Da, Dave Oshana or Lobsang Rampa over Nick's latest offering."
1,cerel bowls,"I have a collection of several different Emily Henry dishes, plates,casserol dishes, desert plates and cereal bowls. They are all red. I am very unhappy with the bowls because you see every place a spoon or fork has touched the inside of the bowls. I have stopped collecting her dishes because this is imbarrishing and too expensive to hid in the cupboard.Nell"
3,Nice if you can actually install it.,"The Frigidaire 15,000 BTU conditioner keeps a pretty large room cool, creates a moderate humming sound and has a terriffic energy star rating.Setting up this beast will make you want to jump out of a window, be prepared to spend hours, many hours. The instructions are poorly written, the illustrations are unhelpful and the construction of the front piece is shoddy at best. Good luck trying to get it to snap into place. Mine didn't even line up with the frame."
3,IS NBC ANTI AMERICAN?,"this movie depicits how many journalist really are. they donot support their countries.they want that 'big story' at all cost. they think they want to tell the truth, however, they do more harm to their country with their biased reporting than the enemy, in fact the american news media has been a great support to terrorist...i liked the scenery,the actors were good and did a great job of protraying journalist,the characters read like a mike hammer book. the terrorist were depicted as terrorist, the US was depictied as the bad guy killing women and children (who have been know to protect terrorist)....it is interesting to see movies that americans make to put down their country and these very people should move to china. maybe then they would be better american movie makers.no good John Wayne patriotic movies for 21st century americans."
4,A Very Good TV Movie,"This was a very good TV movie about reporters, and how they cover the stories, while trying no to become the story. Jeff Goldblum was excellent as was the directing and the writing. I easley see this becoming a series if they want to."
1,Leaves too much to desire,"I had great anticipations for this movie, I hoped it would explain the middle eastern conflict in great detail.I would learn about the moslem fundamentalism that went from fanatism to terroism. Unfortunately, the characters in the moviewere painted in a b-picture black and white fashion. The scriptemployed klischee's but no information. It seemed like the script writer has never touched foot in this area. It also had the feel of a formulated action - adventure movie, with some middle eastern flavor thrown in. And not even a suspenseful one.The talent of Jeff Goldbloom was entirely wasted in this contraption of a movie. If you want to watch a good movies aboutthe middle eastern conflict, watch ""Bravo two zero"", ""The one that got away"", ""Kandahar"" , ""The Beast"", ""Marooned in Iraq""and ""Kedma"". Do not waste your time and money on this b-picture."
5,Soul Bird: Whiffenpoof by Cal Tjader,I still have my 60's LP of this recording and didn't realize until now that a remastered CD is available! This is a wonderful album any Cal Tjader fan will enjoy! Every track is 'special' in some way. You will listen to this CD over and over again. It sounds especially wonderful late on a rainy night...peaceful....calming.....wonderful music.
3,good product,"The product has a good quality plastic, I do not gave it 5 starts because it didn't came on the color shown on the description and there is no place to choose it or modify it"
4,Durable and handy,"I am very pleased with this set. I was pleasantly surprised at the sturdiness and durability; I expected them to be a bit flimsy considering the price and picture shown. Yes, the fork is not so great at stabbing, but it is difficult to find a toddler fork that is. The spoon is just right and the carrying case is compact and perfect to throw in the diaper bag. It is a little annoying to not be able to pick a color, I would have been miffed to get a pink set, but mine was green with a white case, pretty neutral.Edit: My original review mentions being pleased about the sturdiness based on the price; well, I probably paid about half of what this set is currently being sold for (appx. $17). I would not purchase this product based on the current price."
3,"good set, case stays closed, colors unpredictable","They do say,""colors may vary."" Mine are bright pink. I have a daughter. I might have been upset if I had a son.I like the set though. I bought them for a road trip. I take the all over the place now. They stay clean and separate from all the stuff in the diaper bag. Yes, you could use a plastic bag for the same purpose. So, so I need this set? No. Do I use this set? All the time.Just a note- my other toddler flatware fits in the container too. Not at the same time, of course, but instead. Thus, I don't have to worry about the right flatware being clean.The spoon is deep enough for cereal with milk. I think the shape works well. The fork- pretty mediocre. It is hard to get forks right I guess, dull to be safe, but still useful. This one is safe, but don't expect to poke anything (not even roast potato! We tried!)They are cheap though, and I use them all the time, so it gets a few stars."
2,A compilation of very uneven quality.,"I'm sorry to report that a lot of the versions on this tribute compilation are pretty substandard. You can understand why some of the bands are obscure. That being said, I can appreciate that hardcore Accept fans might still want to own this one. High-quality standouts include Steel Prophet and Sinner's versions of their respective songs."
1,music for pansies,"this is the worst band I've heard in a while. I live in San Diego and all the people in my high school think that they are god. Even the girls that just like pop and music what's played on mtv. Save the money and buy real music, not pop-punk trash. (if you don't believe me listen to punk rock girl)"
1,absolutely terrible,"this cd was a great disappointment. after being plugged numerous times byt absolutepunk.net, i had the preconcieved notion in my head that this was decent. they're not even bad, they're absolutely terrible. the cd has no substance, just people playing bad songs with bad lyrics (listen to ""high school"" for an example) that have no emotion of meaning. search the freebie bin for this if want a copy, or download it."
1,an over-produced and over-hyped disappointment,"about six months before this CD came out, I got my hands on some of their music on audiogalaxy. I fell in love, and nothing could come between me and getting this CD. apparently, the songs I had downloaded had not been mastered to the point of KILLING THE SONG, quite unlike this entire CD. there are two songs I can honestly say sound like the should be mastered the way they should be. two. this was the biggest waste of $...I've ever spent. don't buy this CD, unless you're one of those sadist kids who like to hear wretched examples of pop-punk."
4,Pretty Catchy Cd!!!,"This band impressed me ALOT with this album. They are pretty similar to Starting Line. A pretty basic pop punk cd! They are actually starting to get big. Their song ""ON MY WAY"" is on MTV's Perfect Score movie... Give em try!"
4,Talented band with alot of energy!,"I personally think the cd is great,the songs we're writing very well.. and I also think that these boys have alot of talent,I saw them during the Warped Tour, and they put on an excellent show...They also earned my respect because how sweet and fun these guys are, I hung out with Marc,Trevor,Jon and Jordan after the show, and they are very sweet..I hope these boys get big one day, they deserve it by far! Good Luck Boys.. And Have fun touring!"
4,Pop (Punk?) Boygroup,"Right now this kind of pop (punk?) combos like NFG, The Starting Line, Mest, Good Charlotte... are very popular in the states. Off By One has that same kind of style, they have great melodies and mostly dumb lyrics about girls like all the other. There are better bands with better lyrics you can listen to, but I would also prefer listen to Off By One on the radio than to any other pop ....I think these bands are more like boy groups with guitars, but I love it too! Maybe this will be the next hype, boygroups with guitars!!! Ok, listen to ""Change"", ""On My Way"", ""Cinderella"" and the cover of ""Torn"", great singalongs, thanks guys for a couple of sunny days in Germany !!!"
5,AWESOMENESS,"I first heard of Off By One from one of my friends and he told me to listen to the song change. It became my favorite songs and then i heard 2 more songs by them, Been Alone, and On My way, i liked them so I decided to get the cd. I love this CD! i listen to it almost every day!"
5,"Off by One , Is the one",Off by one has put out a CD that I think defines modern rock. Every single song on this CD offers a fresh sound that stays close to it's rock roots that brings complete satisfaction to the rock lover. I wouldn't be taken at all if this band became the next biggest rock sensation. Only if their record label would help promote this band more just let the public hear this amazing band and the crowds and crazed teens would flock.
5,You should be dancing,Very simple but effective house. I love the distorted backups and the vocals that drip with attitude.
2,Romance is here where?,"Okay the plot is almost completely improbable, of course a little suspending of reality is in order when reading this books. But this was just silly.I read it about a week ago and only a few things are sticking out in my mind. The female character's ability to get stuck in a really dumb situation. Her very comical beef cake brothers(think SNL's ""I'm gonna pump YOU up!"" skits) The male characters nastiness, I wouldn't want to be stuck having a kid with him, he showed almost NO redeeming qualities, he's pretty much an idiot when it comes to people too.The romance in this was nil, also. I wouldn't reccomend it unless you just want to read this whole series, even then...meh."
3,Fun Old-Time Jazz,"I was disappointed in the fact it was recorded in MONO. It would be much more enjoyable in Stereo, but it is what it is. I still recommend it for fans of this style."
5,Awesome Text!,"This book is user-friendly, and students really like it. The only thing they don't like is the price, but, every intro text like this is over $100 these days. I really love this text for teaching my introductory classes."
5,Really Comprehensive Book on Insurance,"After reading the basic ""insurance of dummies"", I wanted something with greater depth and detail. This book achieves this purpose, yet it is very easy to read.The layout is excellent with thoughtful advice. As a consumer it has enhanced and my respect for the business of insurance and immunized me against the usualmedia diatribes against insurance companies and the insurance consumer."
2,Too long...,"I usually enjoy these types of books, but I found it difficult to get through this one. Some excellent ideas concerning a variety of topics."
5,Apologetic Resource,This book challenges me and also provides a rich resource to use apologetically against every sort of world view. Somewhat dated but still relevant.
4,"Great read, mildly flawed...","Very intelligently written, this book is an excellent outline of the ""Christian Worldview"" for those who are interested in sharpening their own thinking on it. His ammo for debunking the current state of ""naturalistic"" and ""post-modern"" thinking is good, but I think Chuck is stepping out of his area of expertise when he critiques modern culture, especially music. So a couple of the last few chapters drag the book down a bit. But it was otherwise an excellent read, and I highly recommend it to people who struggle with what it means to be an intellectual Christian in this modern age."
4,A Complete Look at the Christian Worldview,"If you didn't know, Charles Colson spent time in jail for the Watergate thing. Now, while I don't hold that against him (he has since become a Christian and now runs a prison ministry), he does still seem a bit too Republican for me. I can't stand Nixon, and he still loves the man. But, Colson knew him personnally, so maybe that makes a difference. But anyway, that really has nothing to do with this great book he wrote. This isn't a book on apologetics, but just an overview of how a Christian should veiw the world and why other worldviews don't adaquatly explain everything we need to know. It can get a little slow towards the middle, and I paused halfway through to read The Mark (Left Behind #8), but I enjoyed it."
4,correction to Brent Hudson's review,"The cowriter of this devotional is Anne Morse, not Nancy Pearcey. And yes, Anne, did a phenomenal job on the book."
3,Too Much Book,"I have tried hard to like this book; it was lent to me without my asking for it. I knew I should read it, so I did. But why didn't I like it? Why was it such a big relief to get it off my desk? Everything in it is true, real, and important--the fault must be in me. Too scholarly? Couldn't be--I have an earned Ph.D. from the Univ. of California. Too pessimistic? Too many problems laid in my lap that I can't begin to solve? Too humorless? I just don't know. But I'd love to hear from someone who felt the same way and perhaps feels as ""not OK"" and guilty about it as I do."
3,Not What I Expected-Not What I Wanted,"I'm sorry folks (the other reviewers), I can't see it. This book does nothing for me. As a Christian, this book offers little that is new and I must wonder what the big flap is all about. If I were a non-Christian, I doubt that this book would convert me - it may even alienate me. The authors have an amazing grasp of the obvious and spend so much time in trivial matters that the important concepts are buried. I am told that Charles Darwin (dirty words) read books with a pen knife in his hand - cutting away the unnecessary lines and passages and discarding them. I am afraid of what would be left if I did that to this book - two covers, maybe!!! I'm sorry I spent the money I did in buying the book, and I'm sorry about the time I spent reading it. The authors have tried to do too much and have not done it well. The size of the book makes it to large for a paper weight, perhaps I can use it to prop a door open. Have to find some use for it."
1,how now brown cow?,"Say hi to the worms for me, Chuck! I laughed, I cried, I vomited as I read this marvelous parody of Lenin's ""What Is To Be Done""? Colson has not achieved the wonderful sense of political purity that pervades most of Lenin's work, and his sex scenes, while vivid, are not particularly compelling. But I was grateful to hear about his menage a trois with Ann Coulter and Ted Bundy and wish him many happy returns for his ""new life."""
5,It all makes sense now!,"If you have ever wondered why Christians have certain politics, or are always bushing certain agendas (Pro-life, anti-homosexual, Creationism vs. Evolution) then this is really the book for you. This is one of those books that I carry extra copies of, for people who have those questions. The underlining theme in the entire book is that everything has to do with what we believe (our worldview). I highly recommend this book for anyone who is in a position that they are willing to truly consider why a biblical worldview is the only perception that can effectively address all avenues of life."
4,Who Will Read It?,This excellent book has over 500 pages - over 600 pages including the Study Guide. If it could somehow be condensed to under 300 pages I think more people would be apt to read it.
3,Modern Worldview at its best,"Colson does a good job in this work of breaking down complex worldview and theological issues to the common man. While many texts on these subjects leave readers scratching their heads, this book breaks it down for the average reader. While one could maybe do without the long winded stories in the beginning of each chapter and skip to the meat, this is still none the less a good book. Nancy Pearcy adds her expertise and that helps shore up some of the more complex issues. One caveat to this book, it is done from the perspective of a very modern thinker who can put just about anything into a formula. If that is your style, you will love this book. BJoseph Dworak"
5,A POSTIVE ENDORSEMENT,"This book, clearly describes a World View which every student and adult should follow and live by. It is established on sound reasoning, personal experience, and the Word of God. I heartily endorse it to all."
4,If it only were practiced in his organization,"The book is compelling, no question about that. His insight into the Christian worldview is on target. The book should be read... and applied. Especially by the executives of the organization he is the titular head of.Before he is canonized, I'd encourage you to interview former employees of his organization to find how the Christian worldview was applied to them. Like the Wizard of Oz, the appearance is one thing, the reality is quite another."
5,Colson's best yet!,"Typically if you like Chuck Colson's stuff, you like all of his stuff. This is no exception; however, if you have found Colson a bit dry and analytical in the past don't assume that is true for this book. Having Nancy Pearcy as a co-writer has improved the readability of this book markedly over previous volumes.As far as content, this book is a winner. Colson looks at how Christians must relate Christ to a world that no longer shares a similar worldview. He structures this in a classic Reformed pattern of Creation, Fall, & Redemption.Some of the material covered in this book is expanded from Colson's previous book *Kingdoms in Conflict* but this book is far more readable, passionate, and practical. This is one of the best books I have read in three years. A must read for every Christian wanting to intelligently deal with the issues of our day."
5,Shamefully Unknown,"Dave Petitjean is a great, great artist. I have been listening again and again to these stories for at least 20 years. Everyone I have played them to has loved them. It is not really the stories themselves, although they are great, that make them interesting, it is the way he delivers them. Most ""comedians"" nowadays bore me to death or irritate me rather than make me laugh. Dave Petitjean's are ""clean"", universally appealing stories. It is a great shame that Dave Petitjean has not achieved the same level of fame as many ridiculous, talentless comedians who do not reach up to his ankle. Another great comedian in the same category, but even harder to find, is Texas folk-humorist Bob Murphey. Both of these have the same country-folksy, universal, clean humour and terribly effective delivery. You will not just listen to these guys once and discard the CD (or tape or LP), you will listen to them for years."
5,Stands the test of time,"I read this book over 25 years ago and have always remembered what a facinating premise the story had. We passed it around our family and were all enthralled by it. Something brought it to mind just recently, and I had to look it up and buy a copy. I will pass it around the family again. You won't regret reading this one."
3,It's okay.,"It is a good product. It helps my joints, but I prefer Oscal Extra D3, because the D3 vitamin impproves the calcium absorption."
4,Not too big,I ordered these calcium supplements when my husband couldn't take the larger OS Cal with minerals. I'll be taking those. These don't make him complain or refuse to even try them. Very effective for the purpose.
1,Rambling,I found this book to be a rambling and at times difficult to follow. The author writes in a lengthy style and at times they are disconnected. I enjoy this topic of writing and prefer the older authors but in this case I would not even recommend downloading the book.
2,Brilliant but no pictures,"This is a work of genius and should have been spellchecked, proofread and someone should have had the respect to add the plates to Kindle. A disrespectful Kindle edition. Needs much more work to be useable for research.Why not make it cost something? People would still get it."
3,"Great read, but very poorly converted.","This book is a very interesting read, particularly to those who have great interest in ancient religions, beliefs, and mythology. The conversion of this very absorbing title does leave much to be desired, however. At the end of every physical page the page numbers have been left in. Also, at various stages throuhout the book there are extra commas put one after the other. At a few points there are up to 8 or 9 together. Despite these flaws, I would still recommend this to anyone with a love of ancient lore."
3,Very Interesting,"This was a freebie that was very interesting. It was very informative and somewhat overwhelming in its facts. I like learning about other religions and beliefs...especially ancient ones. Of course, the entire time I'm reading this, I have visions of ""The Mummy"". It was a good, fast read."
3,Interesting Read,"This book was an interesting read; a stepping stone for newcomers entering the world of Egyptology. The introduction into the Taut was displayed fairly well, and by the middle of the book i got a basic idea about most of the characters.It was great to learn about the legend of Osiris, and the great Gods who were before him (ex.Tem, Ra), and also about how the early Coptic Christians adapted most of the ancient Egyptians belief into Christianity.Overall it benefited my knowledge base."
2,book of the dead,biography of the author was instructive. The book itself wasn't very interesting for me. One must be a real Egyptologist to appreciate
1,Bad title,"This is not the ""Book of the Dead"", but rather a book ABOUT the Book of the Dead. I would rather read the original translated manuscripts myself than someone else' interpretation of them."
1,did nnot purchase this,i did not purchase this and and don't know why the request for a reveiw was sent to me. amazon does not always work so well.
3,"Oh, Osiris!","As a long time fan of ancient Egyptian study, I wanted to pick this up to further understand a fascinating culture. This version is not for the casual reader and offers a rather in-depth look at the scrolls intended for burial and embalming of a body as prescribed in the 'Book of the Dead'. I tend to lean towards more educational depictions of historic cultures and this fit the bill. It is lengthy however and doesn't lean to the narrative, but will still give an enlightened view into ancient Egyptian funerary practices."
4,Book of the Dead review,The Book of the Dead was referenced several times in my favorite series Stargate SG-1. It was very interesting to read and learn how the references played out in the show.
2,False Advertisement,"This product claims to fit mostly all INDOOR FAUCETS but it doesn't.In 2 very frustrainghours I tried 3 different ones encluding my 2 bathrooms which have 2 different faucetsmy kitchen sink which has the long neck, and as a last attempt I actually tried it onmy outdoor water spigot which is totally useless even if it did fit because it's to water myINDOOR plants and don't think I'll be wanting to go out in the cold weather to connectto an access point that should be working INSIDE the house.Out of all the purchases I have made over the years with Amazon, this is the first onethat I am forced to return and except for the other 2 items that came with the orderthat I will be re-ordering more of, I don't plan on making my Annual Christmas orderthis year and will go to the companies web sites instead.Claber 8583 Koala Indoor Faucet to Garden Hose Connector"
5,Saved my budding interest in gardening!,"This is a very simple connector that can attach a standard garden hose to a standard faucet. The instructions are a bit lacking (just a few pictures on the packaging), but it is fairly straightforward. I've had issues with water spraying all over the general sink area when the attachment was not secure enough, but I also managed to indent the faucet head by securing it *too much*, so watch out for that!That being said, this has been well worth the $9 I paid for it and more. I only recently started gardening and the daily 10+ trips back and forth with a watering can were almost enough to make me want to give it up already!I highly recommend this product as long as you have a standard faucet and hose."
1,This poorly designed connector will damage your faucet,"I purchased this to connect my washing machine to the kitchen faucet.Unfortunately, once attached it mostly just sprayed water out between the white gasket and the faucet.We tried several faucet nozzles to see if they would work better with this connector. But none did.The device even dented the top of the faucet when I tried to tighten the connector to get a snug fit that didn't leak.I have a typical kitchen faucet, nothing fancy, if the design of this connector worked it should of worked well with my faucet.So now I need to replace my faucet, as well as replace the the Claber 8583 Koala connector with something else that will reliably connect a hose to a kitchen faucet."
3,it didn't work in any of my faucets,"It seems like a good product (it seems pretty sturdy) except it didn't work in any of my faucets. I've even tried it my sister's and my neighbor's house and it didn't work in theirs either. I think it only works on the type shown. The only reason I didn't return it: it's too expensive to return compared to the price to keep it. I'd rather give it away to friend/relative/neighbor who can use it. It looks like it could work if you have the right faucet, that's why I rated 3 stars, otherwise it would 1 or none."
1,Ridiculously small... Will not fit on any faucet in a modern home.,"I don't know what they were thinking when they made this device, but the opening is so tiny that it would never fit on any sort of faucet in a modern home. Sending it back today."
1,Will not fit most indoor faucets,"I tried it on all 5 of my indoor faucets. Directions were non-existant and, while some claim it is intuitive, it's not really. Once I got some further instruction I figured out that ut will not work on the vast majority of sink faucets. The faucet must be narrow enough (max about 1 inch) to fit into the adapter. So fancy wider faucet casings won't work. And the bend in the faucet must be less than about an inch max (bend to spout). There must be a bend in the faucet of 90 degrees or less. Claims to fit most...I would guess it would fit very few."
4,Here's my directions since it only comes with a picture.,Just got this connector so can't give it 5 stars yet but so far so good. Before ordering I read the reviews and decided to get it and figure it out myself. Start out pulling apart the 2 pieces by pulling down on the orange band (quick release). Now you have one part to screw your hose to and the other will be on your faucet. Your faucet will ultimately be pressed into the white rubber seal. Adjust the connector by turning the black flang so your faucet head with fit into the opening. Press down the orange top so the faucet presses into the white seal tightly. Turn on water...no leaks? Tight enough! Click your hose with its piece into the connector on the faucet and you're ready!
4,It works for me.,"Luckily I have a faucet that this connector fits. After adjusting the connector to faucet seat to achieve a good seal it worked as advertised. Your faucet should be no wider or deeper than 1 1/4"". During the process of attaching the connector make sure faucet to seat interface is perfectly centered. I can't wait till it's time to water again :-)"
2,Won't fit traditional simple garage sinks,"What you don't see here is the picture on the packaging - of a BATHROOM sink with a VERY short piece pointing down (where the water pours out) after the bend. My garage sink has a vertical section of about 2-3 inches after the bend, quite common, and it would not fit. I wish the description were better, I could really use something like this."
4,"kinda slides, but best in market","i use theh Claber 8583 Koala Indoor Faucet Adapter for a hose to spray off the decks of my apt, it works but does leak at the faucet. i drape the faucet with a towel before i turn on the water. no other complaintsproduct link; http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BPFYG4/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,Did not fit any faucet,Did not fit any of the 3 different types of faucets in my house. I guess the adapter will only work for a very specific shape/size of faucets. The manufacturer should be much more clearer about this.
2,not as pictured or useful,"Arrived this morning -- haven't tried out the ""connect-to-faucet"" part yet (although I am somewhat concerned about the small size of the hole -- not sure what kind of water pressure I will get)-- but the lower connector arrived with a FEMALE end (not the pictured, and useful, male end) -- so I now have to go out and find a compatible MALE end so I can actually connect a garden hose -- careless on their part"
4,NEEDED ATTACHMENT,It took a little effort to understand how to attach to faucet as instructions are not that great. Once attached it worked very well.
2,Doesn't work on my kitchen faucet,Was very excited and then disappointed that this did not work on my faucet - description should come with visual and better description of what faucet types will work - Harriet
3,good but not so good,works well but not where i need it in the bathroom works on small kitchen faucet but ones without an agressive neck or laundry sink.
5,Super easy indoor faucet connect,Like all claber products it does what it is supposed to very easily. Was very easy to connect and provided a leak free faucet adapter. Would recommend if need indoor hose connection.
3,Seventies Teen Idols,"The Osmond brothers ruled the UK charts in the heyday of teen-pop in the early 1970s. They were ultimately more successful in Britain than in the USA. One Bad Apple was the first hit, and was soon followed by chartbusters like Yo-Yo, Down By The Lazy River and the experimental, eyebrow-raising Crazy Horses with its impressive neighing guitars. Other hits include Goin' Home and Love Me For A Reason. This delightful collection of up-tempo pop and love ballads also includes their version of He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother which is quite good. You will love this album if you were a teenager in the seventies and you remember the times when The Jackson 5, David Cassidy, The Partridge Family and the young Michael Jackson were making headlines. As teen-pop goes, this music has aged rather well as measured against the output of a lot of today's Boy Bands."
3,Over looked and underated gem.,"This movie deals with the very real issue of what happens to a person who has had to kill in self defense(especially when it is not clear that it was necessary.) Kristy McNichol's performance in this film is very moving, and easily one of her best. The film is a little difficult to follow at certain times and is definitely out of the box in some ways but is certainly worth watching, and a staple for any Kristy McNichol fan."
2,Deservedly Ignored,"This ""Dream Lover"" (not to be confused with the 90's James Spader/Madchen Amick film of the same title) is a stinker. It was the kind of lazily written film in which they depict how crazy the psycho-killer guy is by showing him lifting weights, cos, you know, the scriptwriter saw ""Taxi Driver"". It did the same thing for Kristy McNichol's career that ""Fresh Horses"" did for that of Molly Ringwald."
3,Keith speaks,"Trio tribute suffers from Jarrett's near-exorcism of possessed grunts, groans, hums and howls which plague otherwise crisp delivery. A shame little more restraint was not involved- the centerpiece extended jam with some tasty covers on the side with these three made for nice potential, only partially fulfilled."
3,Too many distractions,"I purchased this c.d. because of the glowing recommendation I read on this website. In fact, this is not one of Jarrett's better albums. The verbal distractions are horrific: buzzing, grunting, groaning in alleged ecstasy. You can hardly follow the music at times.I've heard Jarrett play Bach and Monk superbly. If he would only keep his mouth shut when swinging!Oh yes, the piece For Miles is abstract and not particularly interesting. The distractions are at a minimum, however."
3,SUBJECTIVE AND NOT INSPIRING,"THIS BOOK IS EXTENSIVELY A SORT OF TRAVELOGUE-DIARY, WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PERSONAL ACCOUNTS. IT READS LIKE A RECORD OF VOYAGES, WHICH IT IS. ANTHOLOGY IS A BETTER DESCRIPTION. THE AUTHOR KNOWS A GREAT DEAL BUT THERE ARE NO NEW REVELATIONS HERE. A BETTER ORDERED SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT WOULD HAVE BEEN PREFERABLE.A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY."
5,great,"Like The First Time by Francis RayA few woman get laid off due to bad economic times and one other wants to get with them to do something she's put off her whole life.One is good at selling, one at making beauty products and one has all the money. They can go in together and make it work.Although they put their all into this project some of their spouses or loved ones think they have made a mistake. This book followstheir lives and how they are able to accomplish it all and what they've had to give up for it.Such an awesome idea for things you can do at home but it's more work than just for one person on their own.Such a diverse group of women, strong, easy to keep track of them and their loved ones."
2,"Very Boring, long and dragged on","This book dragged on and on - and not in a good way. It was way too predictable, and I felt that most of the time nothing was happening. I agree with the other reviewer that said the dialogue was non-believable (It kind of felt like a grandma speaking slang to try to sound cool with the grandkids - but she's doing a poor job of it).I'm actually surprised about all the positive reviews the book received and would be interested to know the general age category of the reviewers (im guessing older.) I would have left my rating at one star but I like the fact the girls reached for their dreams to start a new business - so for that, it gets two."
3,Ray Knows Romance!,"Claire and Brooke lose their 9 to 5s. Claire turns to her friend, Lorraine, who convinces Claire to tap into Claire's underlying skills and start a business. Claire solicits the help of Brooke and the three ladies create Bliss, the shop and product line. In between making the business a success, Claire, Brooke, and Lorraine deal with the ups and downs of finding and sustaining love and happiness in their personal lives.Francis Ray writes about love and romance with a sincerity and purity that is first-rate. The pages of this story ooze with love, lust, and possible lost - so much so that it makes the book hard to put down. I could see myself as a fly on the wall as the story unfolded. Truth be told, I found myself tearing up in some moments. Darn shame - LOL.This is the 3rd book of Ray's that I've read and have in my collection and she has yet to disappoint. Good stuff here! 3.5 stars!"
3,Good but slow,"This novel caught my attention on the first page and it lasted to about halfway through the 350 page novel. There was about 100 pages I really had to push myself through because the story seemed to stall. And then the last chapter was just too pat of an ending. I thought Claire was really going have to fight to win her man back from his own inflected prison, but that didn't really happen. I also wanted a bigger can of whoop arse when she finally stood up to her brother. Lorraine and Hamilton weren't as dynamic as the other characters and I also thought the conclusion of their strife was too pat. She said nothing more than what she said the entire book to turn him around. And what was Jana's plan? Just go in a room and stand there? same for the Bliss shop? I thought someone as cunning as she was portrayed would of had a better plan. Again the last half of the book I was skimming and the book still seemed long."
5,This is a Must Read,I really enjoyed this book. The Man of Bliss concept was just brilliant. I loved how the women stood strong for what they believe in and conquered. If you are not sure about the author this book will make you change your mind.
1,Stinkola!,"This book is ridiculous. Although the story isn't horrible, it's isn't particularly involving and the incredibly hackneyed dialogue and descriptions are laughable. Try reading a passage out loud and see if ANYONE would speak like that. You'll sound like a fool. How did this get published?????"
3,"It was okay, just missing something....","I wanted to like this book more, but it was just ""ok"". Some of the banter between the two main characters was clever and I had hopes, but I was disappointed overall. Despite what other reviewers have said, I do not think the characters were well drawn or fleshed out in the least. The characters were not described in enough detail to form a mental picture of them. There were little or no ""personal peeks"" into their lives, some idiosyncrasies that help define their character, or demonstration of their emotional state. Reading the book was alot like reading a resume, dry, factual, no personality.I thought the plot might save the day. It didn't. The ending was....messy? under-developed? lacking realism? It just had no teeth. I think the author is worth looking into later on, once she has some more experience under her belt perhaps?, but the book is a miss."
1,Needs a little fact checking,"Usually I enjoy this type of literary tripe. Easy reading without much effort. However a simple wikipedia search would have greatly helped the author.The most egregious bits of misinformation were:1. The description of the USS liberty incident. The author give the number injured as the number killed.2. When the protagonist (an aging US senator) blithly hops into a UH-1 iroquois helicopter (yea sure he has 3-4 hours a month to stay current in this beast) and is being chased by a Bell Jet Ranger he says that the Jet Ranger can do 300mph. Acutally it has max speed 139mph the same as the UH-1. If he wanted to get away he could climb since the UH-1 has a service ceiling of 18,000 ft and the Jet Ranger 13,000 ft."
1,"false historical ""facts""","I CHOSE THIS BOOK FOR TWO REASONS. ONE WAS THAT IT WAS RECOMENDED BY H. COBEN WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS, AND THE OTHER REASON IS FOR THE DEDICATION TO THE USS.LIBERTY.I KNOW THE LIBERTY INCEDENT, AND THE WAY THAT IT IS WRITTEN AND DISCLOSED IN THIS BOOK IS COMPLETLY CHILDISH. THE AUTHOR HAS A COMPLETE CONCTIPATED IDEA AND A DIARRHEA OF WORDS, THAT WITH A LITTLE RESEARCH AND A LITTLE MORE EFFORT WOULD HAVE PUT THIS SUBJECT IN PROSPECTIVE. (SHIP WAS SUNK WITH ALL HANDS???? REALLY)AFTER THAT FALSIFIED STORY THAT THIS BOOK IS DEDICTED TOO, I HAD TO STOP READING.AS WAS COMENTED BY OTHER READERS, THINGS HAVE TO MAKE SENSE, AND THIS BOOK DOES NOT. IT FALLS SHORT, AND THEREFORE NOT WORTH THE READ."
3,Superficial and a bit outdated,"At the end of 2008, be aware that this book is a bit outdated in his content."
3,"A Cheap, but Brief Thrill.","This is a very cheap knock off of Grand Theft Auto. Maybe I expect too much, but this has very crude graphics and sound effects. The music is quite good though. Even so, it is addicting for awhile to steal cars, shoot people, run them over, and take on a whole city's police force. The missions are not as important as collecting points, which in some ways takes the long term fun out of the game. For me this game was fun for a month or two and now it's no longer on my hard drive. I suppose it's the best Mac owners can do without GTA. I can't imagine anyone paying the original $29.95 for it."
5,A Fascinating Look At World War 1,"The Complete Story of World War Iis a comprehensive look at The War To End All Wars. Produced by CBS television in the early 1960s and narrated by actor Robert Ryan, this unflinching 26 episode series rates right up with Victory At Sea as an early television war documentary. From the political intrigues that led nations to war, to life in the trenches, to the first air battles, all the way to the sad end, television just doesn't get much better than this. World War 1 was the first war able to be truly documented on motion camera. I'm glad this documentary was produced while the then almost fifty year old film was still viable. Who knows if it still even exists today. Highly recommended for history and war buffs."
5,Our War History with across the ocean,"It is very, very good and goes into great detail. This one of the times I agree with one of out Presidents. President Wilson was one of the better presidents. He stated he did not want us in this war.You really should see this complete story of World War !. Germany and Russia was really the bad guys. Their people utterly starved. We betrayed a lot of times by both countries. We were a happy country at this time. You will see Stalin come into power You will see Hitler as A young man. The Americans did suffer a lot of losses.You will see how this led into WW2. You will see President Truman on a horse in the war. Both Roosevelt'o.and Herbert Hoover. I hope all of us American.will see this,dvd.. I did know anything about this War.. It explains a lot of today."
3,Jarring Music,"This series on World War I was fairly thorough, and there was much footage that I had never seen before, especially from non-western sources. Unfortunately, the music was jarring, or grating. The tunes, the music seemed not to match the scenes at all. After a while, I came to expect some scenes of soldiers being blown to smithereens while accompanied by some happy dancing jig music, or a torpedoed ship sinking with men floundering and dying to the sound of a loud, happy Polka Song.But beyond this mismatch of scenes and music, this series was good."
5,Who Doesn't Like Annie Hall.,It's Annie Hall. Who doesn't like Annie Hall? Really good movie. Important to have in your collection. ... ... ...
5,Don't Forget the Rest of the Crew Here,"Pat Flynn is flat out one of the best guitar players you don't know you have heard. Since the breakup of Flynn's former band, New Grass Revival, he has worked as a studio performer. New Grass Revival was even more iconoclastic than The Mavericks. Both groups suffered from a refusal to stick to accepted categories, which the music industry was not elastic enough to accept. Flynn's solo CD efforts haven't taken off, but he may be sticking too close to hearth and home and not promoting them.Dave Pomeroy is a good guy and a great performer, also. I don't know anything about Rob Ickes, but just the fact these guys let him play with them says a lot."
5,CD review,"I loved this CD! Raul Malo's clear, strong voice blends well with the acoustic instrumentation. What a pleasure to listen to!"
5,Great Cd!,"I have been a fan of Raul's ever since I saw him sing ""Make the world go away"" on the Nashville celebrates the Ryman tv special several years ago. I just love to hear him sing, and this cd isbeautiful. I have been playing it since I bought it and the rendition of Blue Bayou is very haunting. Great job and the instrumentals are first rate. Highly recommended."
2,2.5 stars,"When a ghost of ancient Pompei is given the chance, he takes it to inhabit the body of a time travelling scientist, complicating an already taut situation. Rick has re-entered Mackenzie Cates' life and their passion has been reborn, but since neither is into menage a' trois, they need to get rid of the two thousand year old ghost living inside him, reunite said ghost and his doomed love in the far flung past, and save the world.With more of a backstory explaining the how this time travel scenario functions, the main plot probably would have worked better. Being thrown into the middle of what felt like an established scenario felt a bit off, detracting from an otherwise intriguingly complex situation."
2,Nothing Special,"I'm a big fan of anything having to do with time travel -- have just always been facinated by it -- and I typically enjoy how it can be incorporated into stories. However, this book left a lot to be desired. The writing was choppy, the dialogue was often cheesy, and although the concept was interesting (having to travel back to ancient Pompeii to correct a wrong to save the future) it just never got all that interesting."
3,"Lots of information, but not enough on marketing","The book on a whole was useful, but if you were looking for a book specifically on internet marketing, you might be disapointed. The book starts from the very beginning (e.g. how to connect to the internet) I found it to be too basic at times. I bought the book hoping to find out more about different marketing trends and strategies. It does touch on most areas, but the book itself was too basic. I did not get the detail that I wanted. The book did not cover specific trends such as one-to-one marketing or Permission Marketing. The concepts were mentioned, but the terms were not used. This might be because the book was published in London. On the whole I was disapointed as I did not get the specific informtion that I needed. Instead I got the bigger picture. For a beginner, this book is perfect."
5,An incredible review of God's love,"I highly recommend this book! Batchelor brings a unique approach of telling a story in Mary's life and then follows it up with a short Bible based study section where you can make an application to your life. I love this book and if you are interested in learning more about the love of Christ, I believe you will enjoy it too!"
1,A Very Misleading Title,"Be forewarned that this book is not at all what the title suggests. It has absolutely nothing to do with the Gnostic gospel attibuted to Mary Magdalene. Rather it takes a very fundametalist view of the role of Mary Magdalene in the Gospels of Matther, Luke and John. Batchelor uses Mary as a means to cover a number of subjects that are only loosely related to Mary's role in the Gospel stories.I would definitely NOT recommend this book if you are looking for something to challenge you both spiritually and intellectually."
1,Didn't measure up,I have performed extensive research on Mary Magdalene. According to the research -- this is a fabrication from someone who only utilized one resource as its gospel reference material.
4,well done collection,"As a sequel to Ms. Pianka's COVENTRY COURTSHIP this novel continues the stories of the Thackery sisters, Amethyst, Emerald, and Topaz. Each sister has her own novel and by far the last about Topaz is the best. Each sister fits a certain stereotype: meek, bluestocking, and rebel. Yet each one has her own unique voice and their interaction together and with their guardian, Udora is well developed. I did find the heroes lacking in depth and wished they had been more diverse. However, the sisters by themselves are enough to make this collection well worth the read."
3,Not what I expected,"I consider myself a major Allison Moorer fan...The Hardest Part earned a permanent spot in the cd changer in my car and I know every word to every song by heart. I cannot describe it, but that cd makes me FEEL different than anything else out there. Allison's Alabama Song is also excellent and something I really enjoy listening to. So I keep trying to give Miss Fortune another chance, and believe me I am no prude, but can't get past the lyrics in some of the songs. The whole Ruby Jewel story just rubs me the wrong way, and drinkin' songs like Yessiree don't seem to fit on a ""girl's"" cd.The production ""texture"" of this cd is definitely Allison all the way, and has that beautiful sound she offered with the first two, so yes, it is still better than most of the [stuff] available out there. I guess I just like her songs about two-timing jerks and disfunctional relationships a little better."
4,Allison deverves moore,"What do A Moorer and BadCo's Paul Rodgers have in common? Both of them could sing the phone book and it would sound great. This album is a bit different than the first two but it is still an excellent album and I do not undrestand how countryradio can ignore Allison. Cold in Califirnmia, Soft Place to Fall and Alabama Song are better than most of the homogenized feel good tunes being pushed by Nashville today. She deserves a lot more attention than she gets. Allison would have to change her music like Sara Evnas did do make radio play her music. I hope Allison never does."
2,Wrong title-Should be Misfortune,"I am really glad that I listened to Show before I listened to this as it has a lot of songs from Miss Fortune, but much better versions.I'll explain the 2 stars,1 is for Allison's great voice,though not loud enough in the mix, the other is for Allison's material,lots of good songs here.This is the strangest and worst production of any record I've ever heard and I've heard a lot as I do country reviews. I love Allison Moorer,I made ""Show"" my pic for best Country CD of the year.All I can say about the production is weird.The Nashville string machine is used way too much and lots of strange horns,any guitar except for a couple of very nice sparsely produced songs is buried in the mix.That's All folks."
2,If you liked her first two records as much as I did...,"...you'll find this one real tough going. This is a distinct departure, from the alt-country sound of the first two records to a more ""Nashville"" sound on this one. And we're talking a Nashville sound that's reminiscent of country/pop from 35 years ago-- one of the songs sounds like something Bobbie Gentry might have done.She should shake hands with the producers of this record and run like blazes away from them. The songs are overproduced, some vastly so-- it was like they couldn't leave a good song, or her performance, alone without seeing what instruments and background vocals they could layer on. They made lab rats out of some of this music. If a song really needed that kind of help it shouldn't have been on the album.Still, I bought it, and if you are an Allison Moorer fan you will want to buy this CD, because she's a gem even in an effort like this."
1,Miss Fortune,"HiIam really a fan of Allison moorer,However i was really dispointed with this cd. The songs and words in my humble opinion were just not up to par for this classy singer,However im not giving up on her,I would not hestate on buying her next cd,I just think she was trying too hard on this one,and it, to me was a flop.Thanks for allowing me to share.H. ..."
2,"A weak effort, not up to her other work...","Don't get me wrong, a weak effort from her is better listening than most of what Nashville puts out. Her other two records are just much better. This one does not bear up (or even invite) repeated listening. The music is unispired and the lyrics are pretty ordinary, some of it is even trite. If this is your first purchase of this artist start with either of her two previous studio albums, This one is a disappointment."
2,y&t-in rock we trust,"this is one of my personal all time favorite albums,i grew up through the 80's and this album was an inspiration."
2,Needs work,"In ""A LIfe"" there are some parts of the novel you can skip over without losing the essence of a good story. Although this book gives an example of a real-life situation with consequences and resolutions there are too many tangents. I believe it dosen't take that many pages to tell the story of D'Ray Reid. Mr. Hill writes good beginnings and great endings but loses objectivity in the middle. Even in the ""despair"" part of the book, D'Ray is having fun. After reading Ernest Hill's ""Satisfied With Nothin'"" and ""A Life"" I am now a little skeptical about buying hs next work."
2,Design needs more work,"I found the Sonin 2000 to be difficult to use. The largest defect is that if you make an error in entering data, say trying to add 3 feet to 5 meters, the calculator properly tells you that you have made an error, but then it essentially locks up. You can't get back to where you were in the calculation before the error. It has a memory register, but you can't just put a number there, you can only add to the number previously there. Also, the buttons and legends are too small and the feel of the buttons is not very good. (Sometimes the button doesn't make contact when you think it did, and you get thrown into errorland on the next key stroke.)(Sonin didn't reply to my email inquiry about the error problem.) I'd look into other calculators."
1,Don't Bother...,"From the day I got this calculator it started ""Freezing-up"". It would just stop accepting inputs from the keypad. The only way around it was to hit the RESET on the back of the calc (and why is that there?). TOday it froze up for good. Reset would not clear the problem. Customer suppert suggested tapping it on the table to free up any stuck keys (another known porblem...). No luck. Removed battery to try for a cold boot. Still no joy. Managed to break the display somewhere in there. Circular file for this POS."
3,Buttons,The buttons stick on this sometimes but other than that it serves its purpose pretty well. Was a good value.
4,It fits!,"In stealing the radio, the bad boys made a bit of a mess of the console. So I had to rebuild quite a bit. But once I got the harness in place, this unit fit very well. The instructions are poor and there are a few installation options and steps that I had to figure out, but in the end, and for this price, I would say it was very good value for money."
5,Great Shower Chair,"This chair is great! I had one already but, this chair is a great improvement on the old one. I feel safe when I sit on this chair!"
3,Great for showers not for tubs,"I got this chair for my dad but found it to be awkward for him to sit on in the tub...it took up too much room and it was hard for him to get into the tub. We got a ""Transfer chair instead and it allowed him to sit down on it outside the tub and slide over to get into the tub. Better for our situation. I think this chair is better suited for a walk in shower."
4,"Good story, nice edition of the novel","This is a nice edition of this novel. I hadn't read any of Wharton's books, though I've seen several film versions of some of her work. I saw the movie Ethan Frome with Liam Niesson which sparked my interest in the novel. I wanted to compare the two. The book is very short. This is a good edition of the novel because it has some pages of discussion of Wharton's writing style and meanings of events in Ethan Frome. That was a plus for being new to her work. The plot is interesting and I enjoyed Wharton's writing style."
5,Could not find any error...,B. Tupper made me recheck if I received the correct proe wildfire version 2 book from tickoo or not. Because in my book i did not find the error he has writen in his review. I think he tried to write for another book...I am liking the tutorials in this book. Thanks to proe company also for making circular array easy in this version.
5,really useful i like it,really convinient! i save alot of space and also i use it to storage other stuff!!! comes handy...!!! i will buy more
4,Just fine,My only small issue with this is that the prongs that hang over the door are bending up and making my DDs door difficult to close from time to time. They seem a little bendy. We are using it to store American Girl accessories!
5,"Love, love, love it!",AMAZING! Such a space saver im buying two more for my son's room and my bathroom!My shoes all fit perfect int he spaces and I never have trouble finding them!
5,love this!,This is a must if your shoes are scattered all over your closet floor like mine were! it's been hanging on my door with 12 pairs of shoes in it for over a year now. it has not broken one time.
4,Sturdy and Cheap,"I bought two of these over the door shoe organizers to put in my bathrooms for lack of shelf space. The clear pockets make it easy to find what I'm looking for. They're really useful to organize much more then shoes. They arrived quickly, were very cheap and appear to be sturdy so far."
4,pretty good,"It is pretty decent for its price, except for the hangers that go over the door. The hangers are not wide enough to fit my door"
5,Great for storage other then shoes,"I wanted these hanging organizers to store my cleaning supplies in our bathroom and for toys in my children's bedroom.They are doing exactly that. The organizers are good quality. I am sure they would be great for shoe storage, too."
4,Didn't went to put it down,One of the best and enjoyable books that I have read in some time. It is a blend of real world events and fiction.
5,GREAT REFERENCE MATERIAL,"This is a great book with in-depth and authoritative account of the subject.The author takes a comprehensive approach in dealing with topics such as Separation and Dehydration,as relates to Oil and Gas, supporting his account with easy diagrams and calculations.Each topic ends with a review exercise which forms the highlight of the material covered.All relevant equations are carried out in an elaborate, easy-to-understand masterful way to support the account.In a gist, such an easy-to-follow presentation makes the book a great resource for anyone.Both students and instructors will find this book so compelling in the area of oil and gas processing. It receivesmy highest recommendation, worthy of sort for anyone in the industry; professionals and students alike."
5,love it,Put it in and let it play.... worked fine... cant complain the boys love it and all the disc work without a doubt thanks again.
4,Pleased with purchase,Grandson loves the Fresh Beat Band and he is really enjoying having the entire second season of the show. I made a wise choice.
1,None of the discs even work,"I am going to see about getting a refund, none of the four discs in the case even work. They will not play in either of my DVD players."
5,Well worth it,The dvds contain all episodes of Season 2 (19 episodes total). We play it in our dvd player in our minivan for our 2 year old son and he is mesmerized...he absolutely loves it.
1,Very upset,My 2 1/2yr loves this show! I was so excited to get the DVD for her. Pretty mad when only one disc out of 4 work :-/
1,Fresh bead band is gread but amason demand not gud,"Fresh bead band is gread but amason demand work only on pc , i cant play on dvd or on media player"
2,Lousy and Poor DVD quality,"Same as what i have on Season 1 DVD, the quality is very lousy and poor! I cannot play the DVD finish or always black screen at the end of the movies. I also can't play it at my car, really lousy on it."
3,DVD,Not exactly sure why - videos play in portable DVD player for car.videos play on laptop - but DO NOT PLAY on DVD player hooked up to TV.Bit disappointed and no response from seller as to exchange orquestion why this would occur.
5,Gwinna is a wonderful and enchanting book.,"Gwinna is a girl who was given to her parents by the mother of owls. Untill her twelth birthday, Gwinna never knew who her real mother was. Then, on her twelth birthday, her real mother wants her back and the real adventure begins.The pictures in this book are wonderful! Barbara makes it seem like everthing is glowing and enchanted in her pictures.The combination of the touching story and beautiful pictures will make an impression on you you never thought a book could give"
5,Childhood Memories,I Adore this book. When I was young I used to take my mom to the library and force her to borrow it time after time for her to read to me and so for me to read for myself. I remember walking into the library and racing upstairs to the children's section much to the librarian's chagrin for my running. This book is beautifully written with exquisite pictures which are actually paintings done by the author. A wonderful story of a girl growing into a woman and the adversity she faces. This is a MUST READ. I bought it so I can read it to my children and they can read it to their children's children. I am 23 years old and I read it again once I bought it for the first time in years. The magic is not gone from this beautiful tale. Each chapter has a magic to share.
3,confusing,I purchased this along with a Proselect cooling system refil thinking I was buying the fan and the refill but instead I got a refill and a refill with a holder for the refill..no fan. it's pretty conusing.
1,"Don't buy, not worth it",This fan does not put out enought circulation for a small dog pen. I would not recomment this product at all. I wasted money on this product.
2,Tiny Tim deserves better,"Mr. Plym's book is a huge disapointment for Tiny Tim fans. Those looking for graphic detail of Tiny's sex life and masturbatory habits will find plenty to chew on, but those looking for a deeper portrait of the man better look elsewhere. I am suprised that Mr. Plym knows so little about Tiny's life and music. Especially the music!!! Tiny was a living archive of American popular song but none of this seemed to rub off on Mr. Plym who shows little interest in mentioning any of this. BTW, Tiny Tim had many many managers and agents during the last 20 years of his life and everyone claimed to be the ""best"" friend. Tiny's memory deserves better than this petrified hunk of wood fiber."
1,"So bad, it's tragic.","Plodding, slow-moving and obviously a fabrication to anyone who knew anything about Tiny Tim. This is not even worth a glance at the public library."
5,A GOOD READ! WONDERFUL SHOWBIZ BOOK,"I enjoyed this book immensely. This book about a ""misfit"" is so insightful, often hilarious and truly heartfelt. I couldn't put it down. What I loved about it was the story of a person who normally wouldn't even be on the public radar, but he manages to actually have a career, survive being made fun of, and turn it all around. It's quite a deep book."
2,Whats the difference between the 8th and 7th eds?,"The book itself is OK at best. The author makes use of OK examples but has some very good questions. Too bad its hard to solve the more advanced questions he asks from the examples given.In compairing the 7th and 8th editions there is almost NO difference between the two. I think I ran accross under 10( at most) total changes, and they were VERY minor. Why print another edition? More money to charge university students is probably why.Oh, and I did very well in the 2 semesters...so Im not just bitching either!"
2,Wrong Book,Somewhat of a misleading description that led me to purchasing the wrong book for my math class. Had to return it.
1,Hated It,"Book was required for an introductory Calculus class. Many of the explanations of the concepts were just to technical and complicated to understand. Worst yet, there were no answers for half of the exercises at the end of the sections, and the steps to solve the ones that did have answers were never explained. I did have a good professor who explained how to solve many of the problems in a much simpler fashion than this book. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has not had any exposure to calculus before; as a matter of fact, I do not recommend this book at all. I can not say here due to Amazon's review policy, but there are some books out there that can explain this subject in a much easier and thorough way."
1,Horrible text on an already difficult subject,"This was a horrible text book. It does not help with teaching, or with explaining the topic at hand. Instead it gives examples,which would be fine except the examples were not like the exercise problems. The book left me confused, and with plenty of questions for my instructor. I hated this book, and looked for better books to get me through the class. Alot of money for nothing. There are better books out there."
4,"Mixing of Techno, Rock and Hip Hop","I just have discovered this group, and I already like them. I have found this album in the 'techno department', which is a bit curious, because the music is above all 'rock', excepted the intro (ambient) and 'For Fourty Days' (jungle/drum'n bass). And 'High on your own suplly' is really wonderfull. This CD is becoming one of the most played ! I absolutly don't know the other albums."
4,Not as good as the first two but a good variety of tracks,"'Getting High' has many more tracks with rock elements than their previous two albums. Many of the tracks have previously been available on singles or as reworked remixes. There are a couple of strange tracks as usual such as ""Heart go Boom."" Fans of Electroglide and Millennium Fever's ambient elements might be disappointed but overall the album is a superb blend of dance and rock. Well recommended if you like your Chemical Brothers and Orbital with a bit more acoustic drum 'n' bass."
4,overall good,"@440 makes good music... all different kinds, from Beast-Boys like guitar anthems, to trip-hop to everything in between. Those of you who saw Lost In Space, the theme song is included as well. Worth a listen, if you like it, try ElectroGlide In Blue"
2,Far from as good as their first,"After a exelent first album they are back again. ""Stop the rock"" is probably the album's most popular and famous song since it appared on the video game Fifa. We also got ""Lost in Space"" another sound track song which they make their version of and ""Heart go Boom"" that had some airplay, decent but quite predictable so to say. ""For 40 days"" is a slow dance track, ""The Machine In The Ghost"" too with some funky beats, also the simular ""Perfect Crime"" should get a mention. So there are a few great songs on this album too, but to be honest this album is far from the other one in quality. Many songs are just too annoying, too much vocals that kills the song and too much ""rock"" into the music, some songs even remind me of Metal-rock. If they could have sticked to the sound of the few songs that acually were good, and not made so many boring fillers this would have got a better vote. The fiasco of this cd might also be the reason why no 3 album is out yet."
2,Pass!,"i was really hoping that this cd was good because i had heard two songs from where i worked (four forty days and stop the rock) and i thought they were great. but the rest of the album was like ""huh! "". i didn't mind most of the rock guitars but on some songs, there was talking that really bugged and didn't fit the songs. i didn't enjoy the album so, for the first time, i returned the cd. it wasn't even worth the seven dollars that i paid for at Tower. so pass on it."
3,Average overall,"I'm not the worlds biggest techno-music fan. But I like rock-techno music. Apollo 440 does it very well on about half of the tracks. If you like ""Stop The Rock"" you'll like the half that I like. If you like traditional techno music you'll like the others. Other tracks I like include ""Stadium Parking Lot"", ""Lost In Space (Theme)"", and ""Heart Go Boom"". The rest are just boring. Overall rating 6-6."
3,Uneven but Gorgeous,"The Cd is all over the electronica map but each track is tasteful and some are down right brilliant. If you like massive attack, bjork, andy wallace, tricky, hip hop and/or the ibiza series than this puppy is for you. Just dont expect consistency- its triphop to drumandbass to light raggified house."
3,1-2-3-not pain free yet,"I haven't read enough of this book yet to see if it will be helpful, but life could definitely be more easy than is described here. The author has his own health clinics and profits by both the book and getting clientele from it."
4,Pain Free 1-2-3,"This is an excellent summary of conditions and products, both natural and prescriptive, for combating pain. The writer describes different types of pain that result from various types of conditions, and avoids technical jargon. In some instances his explanations appear to be simplistic, especially in suggesting products without empirical foundation. However, it is a great primer for those seeking pain relief."
4,My cats love it.,I don't know if it really helps with hairballs or not but my cats look forward to it every morning.
5,A WONDERFUL SATIRE,"Like many viewers, WOODY ALLEN often annoys me by talking too much in his movies.However, when he makes a satire as good as this one,i like him very much.This was his first real good comedy ,that you could enjoy from the beginning to the end.It was a great idea to make fun of RUSSIAN culture, and like many of the movies he made, WOODY is often a master in choosing the music appropriate for his projects.PROKOFIEV'S troika from THE LIEUTENANT KIJE SUITE is such an enjoyable gay number ,very well used here.WOODY and DIANE are wonderful, and many of the gags are side- splitting.If you don't laugh at this one,there is a problem with you, you need a psychoanalysis."
4,Woody Allen's Love and Death,One of the fun movies from Woody's 'wacky period' as I like to call it. Totally off the wall and fun to watch.
5,Woody's best comedy,"This is the most imaginative and humorous film from Woody Allen. Well cast and well written. Those with no knowledge of history may be a little confused, but then, ignorance has it's price."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A lukewarm comedy that offers an equal paucity of laughs for those who are and those who aren't familiar with Russian literature, Love and Death is one of the least accomplished films in Allen's oeuvre, containing none of the anarchy of his early films or the gravitas of his later ones."
5,The wittiest & deepest parody or Russia's 19th c. literature,"Even those who have never read Dostoyevsky or Tolstoy, will appreciate the intelligent humor of this film. Those who have read some of the Russia's late 19th century literature, or even watched Russian-made movie version of ""War and Peace"" will find it even more funny. Every time I watch the movie, I discover new parallels, new undertones, new jokes, and new meanings."
5,One of Woody's greatest!,"""Love and Death"" has long been on my list of DVDs to add to my cinematheque. Well, now it is where it belongs..."
4,Bringing Humor and insight to Electronics,"Working in an environment of Spice fanatices who's circuits don't always work, it's a relief to know that I'm not alone. Bob also writes with a humorous approach which requires some wit in the cut-and-dried field of electronics."
5,Oldie but Goodie,"This was written some time ago, but all information is still real and true. Bob has a way with making learning fun. He should have been a teacher; in fact he is in this book. How about more bob!"
1,Troubleshooting Analog circuits,"Who are the 5 star reviewers trying to kid this book is NOT a good book on troubleshooting. I was completely disappointed in this book it really wasn't worth the time it took to read it, but being persistent I wanted to finish the book because I paid a lot for it. It definitely isn't worth the money even or the time to read it, especially for a beginner and certainly not for someone with experience troubleshooting anything electronic."
4,served me well!,They are a bit heavy on the bridge after a while and the lenses do pop after being dropped a couple times..but the glasses are tough and super cool looking.
5,Ray Ban Sun Glasses,"Good quality glasses, arrived as expected and in the appropriate timing. It was definitely a good purchase in all sense."
2,dont get me wrong,"don't get me wrong this sunglasses are super cool and they look amazing in almost every face; I'm giving the 2 star because though the glasses looked NEW (condition under which i bought them) the temple tips were worn out kinda gray. other than that, great sunglasses look soo cool"
2,They don't look like they do here,Nice sunglasses but they do not look like how they look here. Not good for people who have large heads. They are much smaller width even the 67mm is too small.
5,Awesome,This sunglasses are very very nice!.I'm going to use it all the summers that i can.I recommend it
1,"Good looking glasses, poor quality lenses.","It seems that the lenses are made of cheap plastic ( polycarbonate ) which get scratched no matter how careful I was. Is it really Ray Ban quality ?Never again...... The One star is there because I could not remove it....I will add in honesty that I bought the glasses because i really enjoyed the look. Having a wide face( and maybe a big mouth ) the 67mm lens is a decisive feature.In retrospective I feel frustrated by the ease with which the lens got scratched... So good looks, poor quality."
1,Poor quality glasses,The glasses became scratched after being used for one month. I've worn top brand sunglasses for years and have never seen this before. They were always kept in the supplied case while not being worn. Same happened with a pair of RB3421 I've bought for my wife.Very disappointing.
1,Made in China...Not Italy!,"I bought these glasses to replace the ones that I had accidentally lost on a boating trip. I had actually Made in Italy Ray Bans. These were advertised as ""authentic"" ray bans and the image of the glasses even says ""made in italy"" on the glasses. However, I received my glasses and they were made in CHINA!!! Guess what, Ray Ban doesn't make glasses in China they make them in Italy and have since 1937. So these are not Authentic, they are FAKE! I contacted Amazon, spoke with a supervisor, and guess what...they can't do anything other than to refund my money. No accountability for this lying seller who sells fake Ray Bans just refund my money. So not only am I done with buying from Amazon, as this is not the first issue I've had with them, but I am just going to suck it up and pay the extra money and buy the Ray Bans from Ray Ban's site. Complete BS and the folks at Amazon were hardly any help at all. If you want real Ray Bans don't buy from this seller."
3,Nice,"Nice sunglasses, but seems a little fragile and stays that have been made in China. I am not sure about this economic change or if it is a fraud..."
3,Bonitos lentes,"Bonitos lentes, elegantes y de buena protección. En cuanto a apariencia esta de acuerdo a lo esperado, solo que el hecho que sean hechos en china hacen parecer que el material no parezca de una gran calidad."
5,nice style,i buy it as birthday gift for my friend and he like it and replace it with his old one... also am wearing the same :)
1,Not willing to take a chance,"I just received another cd by Jazmine of the UK, which appears to be copy protected, and I cannot copy it to my computer, and I cannot load it onto a MP3 player. I'm not willing to take a chance that this cd by Jazmine will be different."
3,Not the greatest,"A few of the stories really got me hot, the one with the firemen being the most erotic thing I have read in a while. The rest of the book is kinda generic one handed reading. Not too bad but not great either..."
4,Dinosaur Cousins,The book was in acceptable condition and worth purchasing. It was a withdrawn book from a school library.
4,supreme sound,"a really fun album. i was in high school when it came out originally and remember enjoying it then, and hearing it now after so many years i'm still excited by it. nothing ground breaking; anything in hip hop is anymore these days. sadly it seems the last ground breaking thing to come out of hip hop was the genre itself. but, sold beats, many by the rza. excellent flow by ghost. he's got this great 70's soul vibe to his voice, it comes out effortlessly. track 13 has this cool scratch type loop going. dig it man"
1,Sorry I read the reviews.,"After reading the reviews, I decided to give this book a try. Kassy our eighteen year old heroine is so helpless, faints, alas our 31 year old hero thinks she is so beautiful, is so mentally strong, so fragile .... .DUH. The love scenes start after a fourth of the book and seem to be on every page, along with our whining heroine. Almost felt like I was reading and old Barbra Cartland from when I was a teenager. Well that being said...."
3,ok but pretty generic,"Ok as an introduction but does have errors. Example.. p 114 shows a view from Sugar Loaf.. which is looking west, not east as stated.. speaks of Presque Isle Park which is misleading since the photo actually shows Little Presque Isle. A number of photos of old buildings or view do not clearly identify the specific location as to street name, especially annoying if they are no longer standing. A bit frustrating. If the publisher still has this in print then those errors should get corrected. sigh"
3,Not Bad Adam ...,This guy has set the bar pretty high for himself with previous releases. This album doesn't hit me as hard as 'south of town.' But it's been in my truck CD player now for at least two months ad nauseum. The Cajun Symphony in 'Ricebirds' is powerful. The more I listen the more I find is there. Good. But he's been better.
4,Reasonable substitute for a premium specialty knife for the price,"Better than some other lower-cost cheese knives that are ground on only one side, the blade on this knife is ground on both sides but only one side is a serrated grind. This requires some guiding of the knife through a medium-to firm cheeses for a straight cut. The value is there - these are about 1/10th the price of a premium brand. The workmanship is fine, and the handles halves are attached tightly. Give this knife a try and we believe you'll find it meets your needs. These make nice gifts that won't break the bank."
5,took 38 years to finally find a cheese cutter that works. love it!!!,I was always looking for a good cheese cutter well this is it!!! I purchased one for all my kids!!
3,It's OK,It doesn't cut as easily as I thought it would and it kind of hard to clean because of the jagged edges.
3,not for left handed use!,"angle of blade is made for a right handed person, otherwise this is very sharp and will cut as well as any great knife."
2,Cuts well but slanted,"Okay, I read the review that said that the knife cuts in a slant due to it having an extra bevel on one side but not the other, and thought that surely it couldn't be that bad. It is that bad! You have been warned! While cutting, you have to continuously torque the knife to twist it in the opposite direction of the bevel or it will end up cutting an extra .5 inch at the bottom of the slice when compared to the top. This gets to be uncomfortable in my wrist. However, the knife does cut through the cheese easier than other full bladed knives. If I had to do it over again, I would purchase a different knife."
2,ONLY good for soft cheese,"I was excited to read all the good reviews and expected great things from this multipurpose knife.I received it and immediately put it to work slicing a medium to hard density Toscano cheese.It did not slice cleanly - the cheese slices were ragged and crumbled where a paring knife would have probably done a better job.Ok fine. Maybe I'll try it on apples - that's what it's for. Same thing: ragged surfaces where the knife cuts through, uneven and no control. Not an appropriate cutting tool for this fruit.The ONLY thing I think this will be useful for is soft cheese or soft sausage or soft bread.Not what I bought this knife for. Returning."
2,Doesn.t cut cleanly,"This knife won't make a straight cut through cheese - it constantly goes off to one side, creating uneven cuts.Prodyne CK-300 Multi-Use Cheese Fruit and Veggie Knife"
2,Disappointed!,I was very disappointed with this knife! It does not do a good job on vegetables like potatoes and squash. You need to use a lot of force and the cuts are uneven. I had tried a Cutco cheese knife once and was hoping this would be as good. Sadly it is not even half as good. My quest for a good and inexpensive knife continues....
3,Interesting but dense material,"As a former sudent of philosophy, I did look forward to reading this book and then realized how rusty I was. If you need a text to get you started or refresh your failing memory regarding the major literary theories (and keeping in mind that this book focuses on continental philsophy and European history), then I would recommend taking the book one slow chapter at a time. This material is worth studying but is not easily digestible for the layperson. Still, all of it is important, especially the most contemporary chapters. I appreciated Eagleton's references to the major poets and writers (and yes, most of them were men) and the historical background he provided for every chapter. Again, it's not the easiest book to read, but certainly worthy. I especially liked the chapter The Rise of English. That was one of the most readable."
4,first-rate,"when i was at oxford i went to eagleton's lectures. he was as charming in person as he is in print. smooth and jargon-free--crucial qualities for a writer of an introductory text like this one, which is still the best of its kind. this said, it should be pointed out that eagleton, like most literary theorists, has a rather casual attitude towards other people's theories. that is, he likes to throw ideas around and play with them, which is fine if he actually understands the really difficult thinkers like kant or wittgenstein. but he doesn't, and to a professional what he says about these thinkers often seems a little comic."
3,A good survey flawed by Eagleton's Marxism,"Eagleton's introduction to literary theory is extremely accessible, but reflects his own, tragically outmoded, Marxist biases to a degree that is almost comic. Particularly entertaining is Eagleton's paranoia that a critic might have 'Christian leanings', where his language is oddly reminscent of that used by the right about Communism. English Literature seems tragically prone to taking up ideas ignored by other disclipines (Derrida, after all, is largely ignored by fellow philosophers, and Foucault by historians, but both exert a strange influence in Eng. Lit); witness that Marxist theory is still being taken seriously here. Overall, though, you could do a lot worse, and Eagleton's commentary is always amusingly acerbic."
3,"good book, but...","Eagleton's Introduction to Literary Theory achieves a major goal: it spreads high-level relexion on literature throught both colloquial and precise language. However, Eagelton seems to be a sort of dogmatic in important issues, such as the rise of criticism... Did T.S Eliot stated what he did ONLY BECAUSE he was an ""agrarian society traditional white christian""? I'm afraid no one could believe in such a narrow social determinism. Of course his condition influenced his views on art an literature, but I think we shouldn't reduce his thought into such an hermetic structure. Anyway, chapter 2 ""the rise of English"" is an utterly marvel. If you are familiar with Phenomenology or Hermeneutics it may seem that Eagleton rather simplifies. But, we couldn't ask for more in an ""introduction"". In spite of everything I've said, I would recomend Eagleton's work as a excellent and witty book to read."
3,utterly misunderstands hermeneutics,"The author makes claims about hermeneutics which people in the business would not accept from an undergraduate.The book has good use if one's looking to get a quick sense of the most common misunderstandings of and about hermeneutics, phenomenology, and more explicitly philosophical forms of literary criticism.There are a number of much more conceptually sound intros to lit crit, among them Hazard Adams' ""Critical Theory Since Plato."""
3,worth it for greed essay alone,"Most of this book isn't terribly compelling: I think in their (admirable) quests to avoid religiosity, the authors' ideas tend to be pretty thin. But James Ogilvy's essay on greed is really worth reading: a thoughtful way of approaching the place of desire in our lives, which acknowledges that the outer boundaries of desire head into greed.""You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough"", sez Wm. Blake, and that might be a good overview of the point of the essay...."
2,too small print,The dictionary is pretty comprehensive but the print is tiny and too light for easy reading. I had expected a larger book that would be easier to use. It really has no advantage over the Shilo pocket dictionary that is smaller but easy to read.
5,Fiction that makes you feel.,"It is so rare to come across such a beautifully written piece of fiction. Rainlight had me completely emotion filled from the first chapter. The charachters and relationships remaine unforgetable and lovely, even as my heart breaks as I read. I can't wait for her next novel."
2,"Nice attempt, BUT. . .","rainlight is McGhee's first novel, and is just that: a respectable attempt at a first novel.I was disappointed to find how hollow Rainlight was. There is little light and a lot of tear jerking melodrama without much substance. The author completely fails in creating credible characters, let alone allowing each of them to have identifiably different voices.Most of the chinese material seemed like a forced interjection, lacking cohesion with the rest of the narrative.There is tenderness and a sense of loss inherent in the author's tone, but she fails to bolster that with solid, identifiably credible characters. Work on those voices!!"
3,The right idea,The training diary has all the right kind of sections for you to fill in - the only problem is there is not enough room - there should only be one page per day. Otherwise it serves the purpose if you want to discipline yourself and track your training progression/development.
2,Beware: it's not a book,"Although the trainning diary is an excelent tool in order to get a good tracking of your trainning season, and it's helpful for planning yor season, it's not a book.You should better bought Friel's Trainning Bible."
3,CardioChek Triglycerides Test Strips,"They work great, but what they DON'T tell you is that there is only a certain time frame they are good for and will refuse to work after that time. There must be a computer chip in them that determines the age of the strip and won't register after that date. I bought a large supply to begin with, and now over half are of no use to me!"
4,telecom without the intimidation,"Panko succeeds where others fail: to give the reader a 'kind' introduction to telecommunications. Focusing on a basic, introductory understanding of the material, Panko offers clear, simplistic explanations and diagrams to illustrate what would otherwise be dense material. Once this material is grasped, it is easier for readers to move to a more detailed text. But from a cursory standpoint, Panko does just what he set out to do: to give an introduction to this subject with just enough of a 'bite' for students with little or no prior background to decide whether or not this is a field they might like to pursue further."
4,Good resource for beginners,"This book covers all the basics of data communication. It attempts to cover a broad topic by breaking it down into digestable chapters. It starts with the communication basics and elaborates somewhat on widely used standards and protocols. Although this book is certainly not the ""bible"" of data communications, it's depth and scope of information will give the beginner a good understanding of the topic."
5,Flexible Framework Helps Understand Network Protection Needs,"Best impact for this purpose if used with:Microsoft Windows Nt 4.0 Security, Audit, and Control (Microsoft Technical Reference) by James G. Jumes (Editor), Coopers and Lybrand, Neil F. Cooper, Todd M. Feinman [ISBN 1-57231-818-X]"
1,Wrong cartridge size.,Picture and description is of two pack for size 1 cartridge. What is provided is single size 2 cartridge. The size 1 is out of stock so they send you the wrong size rather than say they are out.
2,Don't bother,"If you like slow, painfully detailed stories told by whiny, negative characters, you'll love this book. Otherwise, don't bother. I have to say that the last few pages were pretty good. However, it's not worth it to plod through the preceding 500 pages just to get there."
1,Horrible,"Maybe its because I'm quite traditional but I hated this book, it made me feel bad about myself. Tan writes in a way that makes Asian men atrocites to society in a way thats very derrogatory.Furthermore, she deifies Caucasian men in a way that makes me throw up. Not a good read...NEXT!!!Yet, there were many things very prevelant to the asian culture that did help me understand certain things. Overall, the book really flowed expect when i wanted to stab myself at the end. +)"
1,You may not get the cover that is pictured here,"I ordered this book based on 2 things: My love of Amy Tan's books and the fact that the cover pictured is the one that I had. Somehow I lost my copy of this a couple years ago and I wanted the same one. I can tell that the blue letters in the title are raised just like my old copy. But I feel very disappointed that the seller sent me a larger paperback with a cover I have never seen before, nothing like the one pictured. I'm not going to send it back as I love the contents of the book and returns to Amazon are a pain and cost me more money, but I will avoid items from this seller in the future as I want what I ordered to be what is pictured and listed."
1,Same Old Stuff,"This book has the same structure and theme as the Joy Luck Club. Read the debut and end it. Amy Tan is obesessed with the melodramatic and maudlin, in the process turning her novels into potboilers read only by illiterate female homemakers. Instead of reading fiction about China, why not go there and see it for yourself?"
3,gruesome story,you can take the kid out of brooklyn. you cannot take brooklyn out of the kid. i bought this book because i was a brooklyn girl. it is an engrossing but gruesome story.read it only if you have a strong stomach.
2,Disturbed Earth,"The story was probably good, but the author took too much time with description of each scene and character. He lost me after a while as I kept wanting the story to take off and take me somewhere. I lost interest and didn't complete the book."
2,Are you Kidding?,"I just finished struggling through this book. I had to check to see if this was a self-published door stop. It reminds me of the old school days when 500 word theme papers were assigned on boring topics. Students would just make things up as they wrote feverishly in order to fill up the required space.Nadelson starts our in a somewhat coherent story line. However, about fifty pages into the book she starts making things up as she goes along. I couldn't tell if the hero (Artie Cohen) is a bumbling detective, maverick cop, or mentally unstable schizophrenic. In fact, most of the characters appears to be mental and social misfits. PLEASE, put some sense into the conversation, some continuity into contacts and meetings.Sadly, the ending wasn't worth the wasted time it took to struggle through the rest of the book."
5,Sensually Pleasing,"This is my wife's ""signature"" perfume. When I was deployed in Afghanistan in 2002, a sample of this perfume was in the Holiday Edition of Stars and Stripes. I loved the way this smelled, and got as many of the samples as I could find. I ordered this perfume for my wife as a Christmas present, and kept the samples by the head of my bunk to smell at night before going to sleep. I knew that I would smell this on her when I went home, and it gave me something to look forward to every night. It's my favorite perfume, and I continue to buy it for her."
3,smell good.,"I got this from another place for my love. I paid a little more than what it is available for here. But my sweetheart loves it. It does smell good. The price is also not too high, in-fact it is affordable to my pockets."
3,so so perfume,"I got this EDP for my wife. She did not like it like her other perfumes. When I smelled it, I agreed with her."
5,Never Out of Style,"Been my favorite scent for a long time, and always will be. While I still love the sweetness of Prada, nothing beats the sexy, sultry spice of my Deep Red. Even a gentle spritz before I crawl into bed has me feeling ultra sexy. Out to dinner, or in bed with lace, you can't go wrong with this womanly scent."
4,Sadistic torture stories of male autonomy,This is a definate must see fiction if you are into torture of male's autonomy!! Have been reading it for over 10 times now! Not for those homophobic and those afraid of pain!
1,wrong part for my car,i took my car in and my mechanic said it was the wrong part. i'm not sure what went wrong but i followed Amazon recommendations based on my car's year & model. i wish to return it.
5,Great deal!,"For the price and quality of these items, you can't get a better deal! It would have cost $110 from my local auto-parts store, but by buying through Amazon, I save over $60!"
1,Don't buy it,"I don't know whose feet this was made for but they weren't human. I'm 5'4"" and 120lbs so my feet are not fat or anything. I bought this product to ""fix"" a hammer toe. Here is the problem... the product is actually designed to be used with the big toe, hence if you put it on like on the picture, a big part of it will stick out and you will not be able to put a shoe on. The second problem is that once the shoe is on, it's extremely uncomfortable. I returned this product the same day."
5,Toe Straightener,"I bought this for my one foot because the inflamed tendons on the side of my foot is making my 3rd toe to separate, which can be very uncomfortable. It bothers me alittle to walk around with it on, but I mostly use it when I am relaxing. Seems to work pretty good."
5,Floppy Drive,The 1.44MB 3.5 inch drive arrived quickly. We installed it in our new Compaq computer which came without a floppy drive. We turned the computer on and the drive worked immediately. It has been a month now and we have been pleased with it.
4,Melvins - 'Bootlicker' (Ipecac),"One thing about the Melvins is that one can never be too sure as to what their upcoming release is going to be like.'Bootlicker' is apparently the second CD in a trilogy of a three disc pressing extravaganza as it was put out between '99's 'Maggot' and '00's 'Crybaby'.Vocalist/guitarist Buzz Osbourne and crew showcase their own brand of what I would call part mutated alternative,part psych metal.'Bootlicker' tends to show the band's more melodic side,of which is a good thing.I believe 'Stag' was the last Melvins CD I had before this.Tracks that I thought were good are the sort of laid back ten-minute ""Let It Be All"",""Up The Dumper"" and ""Jew Boy Flower Head"".Definitely a keeper.Might appeal to fans of Kyuss,Nailbomb,Rollins Band and possibly Sepultura."
4,Not a typical Melvins album,"Listen closely and learn. Most of the reviews of this album are fairly accurate. Here is what you get: The closest thing to Pink Floyd Melvins will probably ever produce and release. By Melvins standards it is soft throughout, it is generally consistent with a lot of synth. sounding tracks which are actually enjoyable as compared to the electronic feedback and god awful techno sounds scattered throughout albums like Stag ( which is still a very good album ),Honky ( which bites ), Electroretard ( only worth buying if you want the fantastic nine minute track Youth Of America ), and Hostile Ambient Takeover ( still worth buying for tracks 1,2,3,4, and 6 ). Remember there are no hard or heavy songs on this album. The only really [bad] song is the last song Prig."
5,Better than Colostomy of Density!,"This album is great, matter of fact, I'de pick up all three ofthese 'trilogy' realeases. You can't go wrong with this album.I like all the Melvins' Ipecac releases with the exception of Colossus of Destiny...that album is more painful than doing big fat rails of Ajax."
3,Evil Zac Reviews: The Bootlicker,"The Melvins have done it again! They have surprised the music buisness with a strange, yet cool CD. This album is considerably different from previous CD's but hardcore Melvins fans should appreciate it. Despite the lack of ""hell-music"" I find The Bootlicker to be a great album, and worth the money."
2,This book is about a little GIRL...,"...not a little boy. It tells of a girl taking care of her pretend baby just like Mommy takes care of her baby. Where is Daddy? Oh, Daddies don't take care of babies, of course! Mommies wear dresses all the time, cook, clean, take care of the children, and feed their babies from a bottle like all hygenic modern mothers! And one day, the little narrator will get to do the same since she's a girl just like mommy, too! Not only that, but the entire book is actually a product tie-in for a line of dolls called Baby Dear produced by Vogue Dolls!The book was published in 1962. Not particularly well written even for its time, its portrayal of child-rearing will be objectionable to many contemporary parents. Including me."
1,A complete ripoff,"I ordered a set of two cartridges for my Pitney Bowes postage meter, and paid for two. What I received ten days later was just ONE cartridge. And worse, the paperwork included with the order had NO contact information for the company I ordered from -- not the name of it or the phone number or Web site anything. It just said ""Amazon merchant"" on a generic receipt for TWO cartridges. I am sure this is a deliberate effort to rip people off who buy little things from merchants without keeping track of which merchant they purchased from. I made a brief attempt to find the company's name but it was not worth my time. I simply vowed not to buy inexpensive office products from any of these no-name Amazon ""merchants."" Lesson learned. Go elsewhere."
1,Good fit,The cut out pieces fit well. It was delivered in a timely manner and was worth the price. Good fun putting it together with my 5 year old grandson.
3,Satisfied,"I purchased the CD for the song Shadow Waltz. I could find it no where else. It had been running through my mind for a week, so I decided to get the song out of my mind and in my collection. The rest of the selections just came with the cost."
1,Once-fashionable biased trash,"Some people may have wondered whether it's possible to define human geography in some useful, rational way. After all, people need space, food, warmth, company and so on - surely it ought to be possible to apply human ingenuity to deduce useful and true overview statements? Maybe; but this book is simple-minded garbage on things like 'racism', prostitution, materialism, sexuality, the wonders of Marx and what have you. Huge bibliography of books that could only have been written by force-funded liars. Avoid this, or study it as a sort of textbook example of worthlessness."
2,not worth the money,"I consider the 3G lensbaby a decent value for money (a little on the high side pricewise, at three times the cost of the original, but a fun and occasionally useful lens to play around with nonetheless).The wide-angle and tele extenders, on the other hand, are fairly useless, and way overpriced for what you get. The widest shot you can get isn't very wide at all, and tele doesn't bring your subject appreciably closer. I expected more -- not 12 mm or 200 mm, but not this marginal, optically compromised performance either."
5,More flexibility for my most entertaining lens!,"I love my lensbaby composer, but was sometimes a little frustrated by the set focal length. Wth these two adapters those days are over! The are easy to mount - just screw them in to the front of the lensbaby - and they have added the flexdibility I was chafing to have. More fun for me!"
3,night vision or not,They should tell you that the only way these things work are in a wide open area. Maybe that is common knowledge to those who know about this type product? I wanted to use in the woods but no way that can happen. Any close item causes a very bright glare that causes you to close your eyes.
4,Perfect addition to cardio workout,"This is a great add-on workout to a one-hour long cardio workout where you want to get some strength/resistance training in as well. Kelly's easy to follow cuing is straightforward and the workout has a few unique moves that other weight-training videos don't. I normally go for Cathe, Jari Love or Amy Bento's cardio/weight workouts but sometimes I need a shorter add-on workout and don't want the dread factor of their strength workouts and this fits the bill. I also like her 30 minutes to Fitnes as an add-on to cardio workouts and her more challenging NYC Sculpting, which is a full one-hour weight-training workout."
4,very good total body workout,"This is a good total body workout that makes a good use of one's time. Because it is both aerobic and toning work, it is very efficient. There are good number of repetitions for the toning exercises and kelly does a good job of motivating you without sounding like a drill sergeant. You keep your heart-rate up with the aerobics. The step is used very little, you can do the workout without a step if necessary. For the core work at the end you can lie on the floor instead of on the step. And for the aerobic part you can put a towel on the floor as a mark to replace the step. I like to use the step, but in the past when i was recovering from an injury i avoided using it. The level is more intermediate than advance.the cooldown/stretch at the end is not enough (thus the 4 stars) but personally i do not mind adding a couple of minutes to do some stretching on my own."
5,Good space music is hard to find,"This has good layers of synthesizers, which sound mellow, not tinny. The rhythm machines sound like real instruments, not like a drum machine. High quality of production, as well as techgnically very well written music. And I don't mean technically good, but won't sell. These tunes have depth and jam, if space is your style. Not long slow entrainment like Tangerine Dream. I suppose if I knew what techno was, this could fit."
5,My kind of music,I always get a smile on my face when these songs come up on my iPod. Fit's in well with what I like to listen to.
5,Best mugs!,"These are the best everyday mugs we've had in a very long time. I bought them 8 months ago, we have used them continuously since, and there isn't a chip, crack or stain - quite a surprise, seeing how clumsy we can be! They are large, so hold a really good amount of tea, coffee, whatever. Definitely worth the price.Update (Oct 2011): we have now had these mugs for 5 years - a record for us! Of the two that we use regularly every day, one has a slight surface crack on the inside but other than that they are still in excellent shape. The other two mugs in the set are sitting at the back of the cupboard, patiently waiting for the day that they will be needed as replacements."
5,"a beautiful, rhythmic story about the end of a drought","This memorable story has a strong, musical quality that children and adults will enjoy hearing read out loud. The rhymes and rhythm are strong enough that the listener can anticipate the words and be a ""reader"" simply by listening to the music of this story. It also touches on the relationship between water, plants, animals and humans without being self-conciously scientific. This is a beautiful book that I've read out loud to a classoom of four year olds and a classoom of eight year olds - it engaged them all."
4,A Nicely Illustrated Retelling of a Traditional Folktale,"A very nicely illustrated retelling of a traditional Kenyan folktale, altered to fit the British style of cumulative nursery rhymes, reminiscent of ""The House that Jack Built."" The illustrations are evocative of African artwork, and unlike many children's books that tell folktales, this one omits the near-obligatory animism and spiritism that permeates tribal cultures. However, it also doesn't have the literary form of most traditional tales. The tale of a shepherd shooting a hole in the clouds to water his herd is lighthearted in its delivery, but it also conveys on a child's level the trouble that dry seasons can bring to a subsistence agrarian community. This is good for children who grew up in a wealthy industrialized society where clean water is available at the turn of the tap. Stories like this one may begin to open their understanding to the fact that other people do not have access to the resources they take for granted."
4,A good review.,"The Bringing The Rain to Kapiti Plain, by Verna Aardema pictures by, Beatriz Vidal is about. The Kapiti Plain when there is no rainfall there and all the animals are dehydrated. Little boy's dad is sick and cannot shot the rain down form the big black cloud above the Kaptit Plain. So the little boy has to do the job for his sick dad.I think little kids would be interested it this book because it help to understand some or little world around you. It teaches you to care for some animals and to help people that need some help."
5,Kapiti wasn't a plain in my neck,This book was a nice book and I will like to read it again.I like that the good writer added alot of detail's and the biraddrop a father on kapiti plane and drought.
5,this book is fantastic.,"I love this boook because the pictures are nice and it is like a poem like this line, ""this is the eagle who dropped a feather, a feather that helped to change the weather"". The rhyming words are feather and weather. I recommend this book for all ages."
5,Great Rhythm!,'Bringing the Rain to Kapiti' plain is a delight to read aloud. The rhythm of the words and the growing chain of the narrative draw listeners in while they get a view of what the Kapiti plain is like.
2,"Agonizingly bad, yet amusing...","This movie is terrible. Bad writing, bad effects, bad acting, just bad. If you are a particular fan of one of the cast, though, you might still find it amusing. I love John Piper-Ferguson, and very much enjoyed his over-the-top villain, although he couldn't pick an accent to save his life. He and his giant, lame minion made this movie worth watching once...maybe twice. Now it mostly just lives on the shelf in shame."
5,"partly action, partly fantastic","but still interesting movie - John Pyper-Ferguson , Billy Wirth and Cady Huffman show us a good work. Space pirates, seizure hostages, release of them - all that needed for the good evening with TV."
3,Too much for a novice,"I've only been playing for 6 months and received this as a gift. While I recognize most of the songs, they are just too difficult at this time. I'll look at it again in a year or so."
4,Lots of music,"Tired of buying song books for only one song that you like?There is lots of music in here, from country to rock.I think this book rocks and I will be gitting more books like this in the future.."
1,my review,"Dr. Ernesto Sagás co-authored ""The Dominican People: A Documentary History,"" a book made up of texts from the historyof the Dominican Republic that includes such hits as a presidential inaugurate speech in all its full glory. The texts arepreceded by short commentaries (sometimes just one paragraph) that offers very little insight into texts that are poorlychosen to begin with. The claim to fame of this book is that it is contains these texts translated into English for thefirst time...."
4,Great for real accounts,"I am using this book in dual with another book in my History of Dominican Republic Class in college. This book is ideal for people who want to read real historical documentation pertaining to the countries history. Packed with information. My only complaint is that the narrative isn't really told in a story-telling type of way, but more so through expository evidence."
3,December 5th of 1492 NOT the 6th!,"IT was very disapointing for me to start reading the introduction and find what I though it was a TYPO but then when I kept reading realized that it was not a typo but a fact that they were listing December 6th of 1492 as the day that Columbus landed in the island! If they had properly done their ""homework"" would have figure it out that the day that Christopher Columbus actually set feet in the island of La Hispaniola was DECEMBER 5th, OF 1492. I stopped reading right there because that led me to question what other facts they got totally wrong?????"
5,Placebo is my med!!!,"I dont understand how Brian Molko and crew manage to create something so unique, so sonically perfect each time they release an album, all the songs in Meds are top notch, Infra Red, Drag, Space Monkey and Pierrot the Clown are the cream of the crop here, followed closely by rest, I have been a fan of placebo since their debut in 1996 and each time the release an album it baffles me how they can write something so different from the previous offering, but keeping the PlaCebo effect intact... Brian Molko's wonderful voice sounds as good as ever, this clearly shows a more mature Molko, the lyrics are less intricate than previous albums but pure genious regardless, put on your headphones take your meds and be free!."
5,I don't just like it I love it!,"I have been a Placebo fan since a teenager, I hope that doesn't give away my age, but the band has really grown since the 90's. I love ""Meds"" because I feel we have all taken that part in life where we downfall and just want to get back up but can not do it on our own.Infa-Red is another great track I wish they had in my earlier years to break up with my past lovers. You can feel the passion the band plays as a whole.But I would have to admit the best two songs in the whole album have to be Broken Promises & Running Up That Hill. There is just something that moves a person to tears when there is this soft signing and breaks into hard heart pounding beat. I must admit I love the whole album. I hope you get to enjoy the experience of Placebo."
4,Rock on,"Placebo have always troden a fine line between exceptional and trashy, but however have always managed to stay on the side of exceptional.The latest offering is in my opinion there best release to date. If only for the first two tracks Meds and Infra-red, don't ever put this album on in a car at night by yourself on loud unless you are comfortable with loosing your license due to excessive speed.Waaaay, waaaay good ablum."
1,boring,"this is an unispired, predictable album that I didn't want to listen to a second time. Placebo committed the gravest sin: bore me. Is there a worse way to spend time?"
5,Gradualy then Suddenly,"The first time I heard this album I wasn't impressed. I thought it was lacking from all the other album. Then Infa-Red caught my fancy, followed by Song to Say Goodbye and then slowly other tracks started finding their way on my mp3 player. Its the same thing that happend the first time I ever listend to this band's music, it starts with one song that you like and then before you know it, you have the CD playing over and over again.Its almost impossible to pick a favorite...this album will not disappoint."
4,Great Album,"After reading all the negative reviews and remembering the weak Sleeping with Ghosts I was a little afraid that Meds would be a great disappointment. But it isn't. I think that Infra Red, Follow the cops back home, Because I want you, Blind and Pierot the Clown are songs that easily belongs to the best of Placebo.This album grows and grows the more you listen to it. Judge for yourself."
1,don't buy this album,"it's actually painfull to see how placebo repeats everything they did in the past, but in a very enoying, uninspired way. If you have the first album, without you i'm nothing and black market music- you have more then enough. From there on placebo has nothing to say... I guess that's the tragedy of pop music....The production is awfull, Brian Molko doesn't sound pure at all and the lyrics are so pretentious you really want to go back to the store and get you money back.. bad deal."
1,"You Pay, They Control","Don't buy this CD. The music is fine, but if you are anything more than a sheep you will not allow a record company and/or artist to decide for you what you can do with music that you purchased. I bought this CD and was disgusted by the digital limitations. I am not a criminal/pirate, yet I'm treated like one. I will never spend another penny on this band or a Virgin Records release."
3,Not their best,"Meds is a fine album, but it do not compares to the previous 4. There are no ""hits"" like Pure morning, 36 degrees or Peeping Tom. The whole albums sounds a bit dull, and the first time I heard it I was a bit dissapointed... But it've grown on me a little. My advice: if you didn't like Sleeping with ghosts, this one is even worse. This is an album for those who are really ""into"" Placebo."
5,amazing,"I couldn't wait for the cd to be released in the states, so I ordered it from Amazon UK. I was blown away. There is usually a point that a band reaches where their music begins to get dull and boring. Placebo is nowhere near this point. The music on this album is absolutely beautiful, and I can't seem to get enough of it. It is leaning more towards an electronic sound, so it's not like their debut cd, but more like Sleeping with Ghosts. It's awesome."
4,"Meds is great, but...","Meds is great, butBEFORE YOU BUY THISbe aware that this version of the album omits a lot of the best songs or versions of the songs. The original UK version is by far the best version of Meds.Try to hunt down a less tampered-with version of the album, if possible."
5,This album is one of their best and a must have for placebo fans,"I have been a Placebo fan since I first saw their show in Boulder Colorado in a stage small enough I could have reached out and touched Brian and this CD has to be the best they have put out. The first two were very good, being the first to get me hooked, but after growing up along with their style this is a very mature, expressive and politicaly infused album. Their last was just a preview to this little dollup of awsomeness. The instruments are creative, the lyrics full of expression, androgynously sexual( as always) and insightfull into the ever sexy and mysterious life of the three members. A definate must have"
2,Meds is an appropriate name,"Meds as an album, is not a grand achievement in Placebo's musical capabilities. Some tracks do have a nice pop cleanliness to them that is very catchy, while others seem to lack inspiration. Molko said he was on meds, and i truly believe this album is better if either: you are on any drugs, or you actually have a respect for going back to the old, trying the new, etc. The production value that Sleeping With Ghosts had was tampered down and more repetative on this album, not to mention the lyrics. I am sad to say that this album was actually a disappointment. Sorry Brian, Stefan, Steve, don't let the producer take over your work after its done."
4,meds,"You don't need meds to like this album, although not as strong as the previous releases I still think this is a great album , especially a song to say goodbye is one of their best tracks ever. Again my thumbs up for this great band."
2,Where's the cowbell?,"I have been a huge fan of Placebo for a long time- ever since I saw them on MTV2 ten years ago, my jaw hit the floor and it was ""pure morning"" from then on. Their albums have always been there when I needed them the most, and for that I thank them. However, this album lacked what had drawn me to them again and again- their rhythm section. The earth rumbling baselines; the foundational drumming. Placebo is better then the sum of their parts, and, when this album only concentrated on one part we were left with a deflated ablum. The singing was what it had to be- overall, I felt it was strong. Yet, that is all we were left with, was the singing backed up by some digital keyboarding that would only get a C+ in my grade book. I am a huge fan of minimalism- hell, I even have an Eames chair- I just don't think it works for Placebo just yet."
5,Breach,I ordered this movie one evening and came home from work the next day to find it had already arrived. Fastest purchase and deliver I have ever had! WONDERFUL!
4,"Cooper,Phillippe & Linney at their VERY best","For whatever shortcomings other reviewers may have stated in their reviews one thing is for sure;Chris Cooper,Ryan Phillippe and Laura Linney deliver truly riveting performances in BREACH.When Oscars come around,these three names should get a mention.The ONLY drawback with the film is the slow first 30 minutes.After that....WATCH OUT!.BREACH is a great study in the duality of humankind's nature....""skim milk masquerading as cream!"""
2,BREACH,"The film showed very dark - as though it were all filmed at night with poor lighting. Therefore I was disappointed. The story and acting, however, were exceptional."
3,Lacking action,"In a valiant attempt at bringing some sort of drama and action to a true-life story, the directors seem to have missed the boat on this one. Aside from the fact that the film is uncommonly short for its genre, there are no cliffhangers and moments that leave you at the edge of your seat. This movie is more documentary than drama. I suppose the only suspenseful scene was the ""Can I trust you?"" scene out in the woods. The actual acts of treason committed were poorly drawn out in the movie. Secret recordings and letters? That's it? ""Hollywood"" forgot to glamourize and sensationalize this story a bit. I understand this was the worst act of treason against our country ever, but good lord if there wasn't enough substance to make a movie with, then why bother?"
2,Tone It Down!,Even the greatest songs played at too high a volume sound awful...THAT was my experience of Breach. Both Chris Cooper and Laura Linney's - both of whom I adore - performances were so completely over the top that I found them unbelievable in their respective roles.Asking Ryan Phillippe to smooth it out is close to ludicrous. I'm disappointed that I couldn't get past these head-scratching performances to enjoy the story which may have been interesting.
2,A Tremendous Story Virtually Swept Under The Rug,"Chris Cooper is a remarkable genius... and enjoy anything espionage related... which is why I checked this flick out. ALOT was left out out the film, and ALOT of people SCREWED UP, in many ways being responsible for lives lost as well... though few if any would actually step forward- cowards they are... but that's how it is. May have been a true story, but was so dull, I had to force myself to finish seeing it. Hanssen isn't the only one who should have been nailed to the cross."
3,Fascinating subject matter let down by obvious treatment,"""Breach"" tells the fascinating true story of the final few months in the career of FBI veteran Robert Hanssen leading up to his arrest for being a traitor in 2001. The film reinforces the hypocrisy of Hanssen - on the one hand attending church everyday yet on the other betraying his country and indulging in deviant sexual practices. Unfortunately the film lays things on a bit too obviously especially at the very end detracting from the impact. Ryan Phillipe is good as the Hanssen's clerk Eric O'Neill, sent in to monitor Hanssen in his final few months, but the other key characters Hanssen (Chris Cooper), O'Neill's boss (Laura Linney), and O'Neill's wife are all somewhat one-dimensional."
4,Susan Edem from New ork,I like a good spy story specially when it is true.It kept me on my seatthrough out the movie.
3,good but not great,"The story was just okay. It's worth seeing , but not a movie you will watch more than once."
5,"great commentary by the protagonist,!","I have actually seen the DVD, unlike the reviews so far. The movie is brilliant, and I will not reiterate the reviews of it. Let me add that the commentary is even better, since it is done by O'Neill himself, the young FBI trainee who helped catch the most harmful spy in American history. O'Neill's role in catching Hansenn was classified until this movie, which is why you do not see him mentioned in any of the books about the case. ( And it makes you wonder what else they don't mention.) O'Neill affirms that most of the movie is highly factual: they even use things owned by Hansen and O'Neill as the case unfolded, and many things are filmed exactly where they happened, including Hansenn's capture. O'Neill provides further truely fascinating insights into Hansenn's behavior. Don't miss this."
4,Highly Recommend,"Great story. Chris Cooper, Ryan Phillippe, and Laura Linney do a fantastic job. Loosely based on a true story."
3,Mildly Entertaining,"This movie was mildly entertaining, but I have one major issue with the film... When you make a film that contains technical terms, PLEASE consult a technical advisor to assure you are using the terms properly and pronouncing them correctly. I just couldn't take the movie seriously after the main character demanded an assortment of requirements. They did not have to describe what an OC48 was (They got it wrong anyway) or specify they needed an IP router. That information provides no additional information to the viewer while ensuring network engineers groan in exasperation.Other than that issue, the movie was a mildly suspensful thriller that should be enjoyable for most everyone."
3,slow motion,"being a fan of fast moving action movies or thrillers, I must admit that the Breach didn't fit in perfectly within that scope - and honnestly I found it difficult not to fall asleep. But the actors and the intrigue kept me awake though. Not so bad after all!"
4,Interesting,"Movie is very interesting and mind blogger. It makes you open your eyes for anything you think is suspicious, is suspicious."
4,"""is it worth it?""","The story of the capture of Robert Hanssen, who stole military secrets from the US and sold them to the Russians, that grabs your attention and keeps you fidgeting on the edge of your seat!It is amazing how a righteous individual can be extremely corrupted inside: It's called compensation. Chris Cooper is amazing as Hanssen , nearly to a point that you almost feel sorry for him in spite of how terrible his character is! Watch the amazing performance and ""Pray for us""."
5,FYI,"I'm not sure if everyone is aware that this film is based on a true story of an FBI agent named Eric O'Neill. Eric had only been on the job around 4 years when he was put on the Hanssen assignment. In July 2001, Hanssen pleaded guilty to 15 counts of espionage and conspiracy charges. I personally thought the movie was gripping.War Eagle!"
2,Read the books about Hanson,"This movie is ok, but having read about Hanson I found the movie did not cover much of the psychology of this traitor. It seemed more focused on an fbi employee who was really more of a bit player in the investigation."
4,Exciting Movie Without Excessive Violence,"The story centers on an ambitious federal agent who is selected to investigate and flush out a suspected mole in the bureau. The movie is suspenseful and attention holding without the usual car chases, explosions and shoot-outs. And there is a surprise ending as well. I liked the movie and recommend it.Breach (Widescreen Edition)"
3,Caught with a red hand,"Although the acting is pretty first rate here, the story is dreadful.The script writer is to blame.It is like they waited until the last moments of the story and, then, blew them up minute by minute.He spied for 22 years and they have about a month in this story.Moles in the security agencies are the worst fear,and they put this one in charge of finding himself...There has been a long history of the CIA and FBI being the worst ever at preventing leaks.The Russian A bomb came from such a leak."
3,Not exactly what I expected,I thought that this was going to be more suspense-filled than it turned out to be. It was kind of boring.
5,Uncommonly good,"Breach is a fine film based on the true story of the uncovering of FBI operative Robert Hanssen, the most destructive counterspy in U.S. history. With tight directing, excellent music, and mostly Chris Cooper as Hanssen, this film is uncommonly good."
3,BREACH,"This Movie shows the real world of Unites States secret Agencies Like FBI,NSA, etc, I found it to be interesting and inteligent Movie, Also remeber This is Based on a True Story,"
1,BE SERIOUS,"I'm suposed to believe that one of the previous reviewers was actually a CIA spook? Yeah right, how about buying this nice bridge I just happen to have for sale. The fact the the movie was based on reality does not change the simple truth this movie sucks. It's not just boring, but it flat out sucked. even after watching it for an hour I didn't care who did what to whom. I just wished it would end and put me out of my misery. My advice, don't waste the time it takes to watch the credits, and if a friend suggests renting this movie, shoot them and put them out of your misery."
1,sorry,"If it dosnt have Airplane crashes or hellicopters bustin, or street gangs getting shot up or monsters chewing the crap out of someone, i dont like it!!! sorry i am an action thriller. i hated this one"
1,Might be good if I could get it....,"Why does it say that this movie is available for rental download, but there is no button to accomplish this>?"
3,ANOTHER GREAT PERFORMANCE BY CHRIS COOPER,"*** 2007. Co-written and directed by Billy Ray. Thanks to Chris Cooper's performance, BREACH could please John Le Carré's admirers. The screenplay of Billy Ray's second film, afterShattered Glass, is far from being original but the characters are interesting and Washington has rarely been so cold and blue. A good surprise."
4,"A Well Executed Tale about a Man Who Should Have Been, Well, Executed ...","BREACH is a movie that needed to be made. It tells the story of an up-and-comer in the ranks of the intelligence community, a young husband longing to serve his country as an FBI agent, who gets the seemingly innocuous and unimportant task of digging up sexual dirt on a senior CIA employee. If only the young recruit knows ....From that setup, the viewer is taken into the hard-to-believe-yet-true story of the last days of America's greatest (or worst) traitor. To say too much would be unfair to those unfamiliar with the story. The final effect is more than chilling; though this creep has been caught, the film reveals, intentionally or not, a system in our government that rewards petty behaviors and is likely to produce more of these villains in our future.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book ""Teeth: A Horror Fantasy."")"
3,"Not an action flick, but doesn't need to be","I wish this reviewing system allowed us to give ratings in half-star increments; I wavered between 3 and 4 stars, and my preferred rating would have been 3 1/2 stars. Anyway, I'm largely in agreement with cglambdin's positive review. This is not an action movie. And it's not a typical suspense story either, since you already know ""who did it"" before the movie starts. I thought the most interesting thing was the opportunity to understand why Hanssen, a devoutly religious man with his own strong set of values, would undertake to betray his country, and to watch him slowly self-destruct under the constant threat of discovery. Also, Chris Cooper did a great job of portraying a complex, conflicted, inconsistent character."
4,"A good movie,","but I wouldn't call it screen material. It should have been put on one of the local networks. The trailors made this movie seem like a thriller drama. At every corner I was waiting for the big revelation but what was told didn't even seem real. I actually thought maybe there would be a twist and it was going to turn out that the cia had set up Eric. Obviously, I didn't know that much about the Robert Hansaan story! Anyway, it is a good movie but just not a movie I would put in the theaters."
4,Cat-and-mouse game,"Eric O'Neill, an FBI agent-wannabe, is assigned as a clerk for Robert Hanssen, a man who is suspected of being a double-agent. At first O'Neill is not aware of his boss's guilt, but eventually he is told the full extent of the evidence against him. He is expected to help out in the investigation, and he risks his personal safety to do so. His marriage suffers as his wife feels he does not confide in her because he doesn't trust her. Hanssen is, on the surface, a devout Catholic and he tries to force his practices on Erik and his wife. Eric begins to see what a double-minded man his boss is and he does everything in his power to help in the investigation against Hanssen. This is a true story about the most heinous spy America has ever had with over 20 years of treachery. The movie is well-written, well-acted and it builds suspense and tension throughout."
4,A Good Movie,"Breach is a good movie. Great for a lazy rainy Sunday afternoon. The film is suspensful in parts. The acting good, but somehow it doesn't reach the category of great. I walked away with more questions than answers. That said, I would still recommend it."
3,"An ""Edge of Your Seat"" movie",I really didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. What an incredible movie! It literally will keep you on the edge of your seat!
3,interesting history,"Chris Cooper is the best thing about the movie. The film definately left me wanting to know a lot more about Hanssen, before and after the fairly brief time period covered by the movie."
4,Taut suspense!,"Even though viewers know how this film will end, the writing is so good that the suspense builds pretty much constantly throughout the entire film. Acting and production values are excellent as well. The scenes between O'Neill and his wife were, for me, the weakest element; it just didn't ring true to me that he could keep her at such a distance throughout his difficult assignment. The final scene also struck me as a bit too melodramatic. But the rest of the film had me going for sure -- I'd give it four and a half stars for its genre."
3,Mildly Entertaining,"This is only mildly entertaining and unless you're a real fan of the cast, it's better to invest in other DVD's."
2,Lukewarm Saga,"It was very cold in the theater, there were no scenes that made you laugh, there were no scenes that made you sigh out of anticipation the film tried it's best to grip you but there were a lot of words spoken which led to a rather inconsequential saga. Chris Cooper looked healthy, he acted ok but it was not really the sort of movie you'd watch without falling asleep. After reading the reviews, I thought I was in for a treat, it was just a lathered up brute of a boring film. I might sound like a woman in labour but honestly, this film was an absolute tanker owing to the lacklusture storyline. Not worth watching let alone purchasing. Chris Cooper is boss and Ryan Phillip is assistant to the boss. There is some sort of conspiracy against CC and frankly, I held my interest for a majority of the film but eventually it won and I lost. The Breach was disappointing, I wish I'd never watched it. That's all."
3,Cooper is great...,"...but the pacing and the dreary visuals leaves this reviewer a little cold. Character actor Chris Cooper never ceases to amaze me. He can become anyone quite convincingly. Phillipe is also showing signs of great potential and because of them this film is entertaining. However, the pacing is all wrong. Too many times I was ready for them to arrest him. There's no surprise-no nail biting scenes that leave you perched on the edge of your seat. This is just a film that's little more than a documentary. I'd rather have seen the information on the History channel. The actors are what makes this a three star for me."
3,great movies,"rated for great acting, good plot, good script, cinematography, These are movies which can entertain us more than once! ....5 stars gets a great thumbs up..."
5,Great Movie!,"Awesome movie! If you really are interested in further information about Robert Hanssen, I suggest reading a book or looking elsewhere for accurate information on this event. It's a movie so it's pretty much covered in dramatic twists and turns and they also give credit to some who didn't play a part in that exact role. Overall, a fun watch!"
4,"suspenseful, entertaining thriller","Robert Hanssen (Chris Cooper) is an FBI agent of 25 years. Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe) is a new FBI employee working to make it as an agent. He is assigned to watch Hanssen. He is to report to his FBI superior, Burroughs (Laura Linney, with details. Eric finds he's drawn to Hanssen's religious devotion and personal code of honor. He then learns the real reason behind his assignment; he was hired to help catch Hanssen in the act for selling secrets to the Soviet Union for 15 years. Breach will definitely not disappoint if you are a fan of spy thrillers."
5,LOL,"I enjoy this book not only because of all the hilarious experiences in the author's life, but also because of the warmth loving feeling he had treasured each event. I am touched by his sincerity."
5,Hilarious fun,"High jinks and misadventures in a family with two sets of twin boys -- these are the kids you're glad YOU didn't have! The stories are funny, heartwarming, and just odd enough to be completely unique. I loved it! And the photos that go with the book are hilarious!"
5,This book is a delight!,I loved this book - couldn't put it down once I began reading it. The stories are hilarious and heart-warming. Get to know this guy and his friends and family... A joy to read!
5,Spots out!,"Although I was a little nervous at the beginning, the procedure was not as difficult as I thought it could be. The kit is quite complete and I was able to clean the sensor and remove the dust in the walls of the chamber. The air blower is powerful, you may not want to include it in your carry on bag because of its size, unless you have spare in some of your lens compartment.I am happy again now that I can take pictures to the sky being confident that the old ugly spots are away. Definitely recommended."
5,Cleaning Machine!,This has everything you need to clean your photo sensor on Nkon cameras and Cannon. It also has enough supplies to keep cleaning for some time to come.
5,Sensor Cleaning kit,"I debated over which one of the sensor cleaning kits to purchase, and chose this one by researching farther...I have to say I made a wise decision...because as a first time user of this product....and of cleaning my camera sensor myself...I got the 3 spots that were messing up every picture I took...especially my landscape images that showed the sky.Service was good, received my purchase on time and intact.No complaints from me.....I am a satisfied customershedra"
5,Grateful,I feel honored to have this copy of books from an ancient bible. Just to hold it and look at it feels sacred.
3,Beautiful but Useless,"I too have seen the originals and was captivated by idea and the execution. When they said that they were going to make versions of them for the public I immediately planned to collect the entire set.Now, 5 minutes after opening this (the first I had ordered), I have already printed off my return label.The font is too small and too cramped. Since it is calligraphy, instead of being difficult to read, it would be nearly impossible to read. The dimensions of the book itself make severely awkward to hold while reading.So if you want a beautiful piece of artwork to sit on your bookshelf, buy it.If you want a beautiful Bible to study and read and enjoy, don't buy this. That's not what it's designed to be."
5,The Bible for all times.,"I bought this as a gift. The St. John's Bible will go down in history as one of the great treasures of calligraphy and artistry of the 21st century. It is truly a gift that Donald Jackson, his co-workers and the Benedictines at St. John's Abbey have given, not only to the Church but also to posterity. As a Christian I am awed at the talent that bring alive the biblical texts, making it much easier to meditate on those texts."
5,St. John's Bible,Outstanding illuminations - very spiritual. A must for anyone who wants to read the Bible with a renewed spirit!!!
5,"Great Book, But...","First, this volume is fantastic - great color and the calligraphy is easy to read (something which is lacking in a lot of 'handwritten' works). There's been much good written about this volume already, so I won't rehash it all here.However, I do have one (and only one) complaint about this volume. The binding is weak. I've looked at three different books and they all have the same poor binding.Despite the binding, this book sill gets 5 stars from me. It's just too beautiful."
4,hugo Dark Blue de hugo,"excelente producto para USO diario y casual. Llego a la hora, RAPIDO, niveles altos de confiabilidad. El Vendedor cumplio con lo prometido."
3,It's Okay,"My wife purchased this for me for Christmas and I am not 100% sold on the scent. It's a bit on the light and tangy side (citrus?) and not very ""Manly."" Right now I am wearing it as my everyday work cologne, but it is likely that I will not purchase this again."
1,Counterfeit !!!,"I bought this item as a gift for my cousin. I've just received and I think its not genuine, the box is damaged and there is no gelatin on the box. Yes it's cheap online but no more trust for Amazon."
1,"Do not buy this product, I think is fake","I bought this product because I though it was not possible to have a fake product coming from amazon even when I read it in a review, but the review was right, this product can not be original, I have used Hugo Boss Dark Blue several time, and this one does not smell the same, it smells like a cheap perfume."
5,Good value - fast shipping,Reasearched this line of cologne both on line and in stores. it is a gift for my daughter's boyfriend in Europe and is not readily available in the US other than upscale stores. Price on Amamzon was very good and it arrived in perfect shape quite quickly.
5,Hugo boss,"I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment. I really will by with you other product."
2,PSP Stand,"This PSP item is really not worth the money. The stand has built-in speakers but the speakers have terrible sound. The IR sensor for remote control use has a very difficult time picking up the remote. Honestly, you'd be better off honlding your PSP."
1,Bowed Bottoms,"We purchased this to use on a glass top stove, and found that the pan was not flat.We assume that not all are bowed, but ours was."
2,flimsy,"The non-stick surface is fine, but the pan is no better than what you can find at the supermarket: flimsy, light and therefore prone to hot spots. For $49 I guess I can live with the thing, because one does not use a non-stick pan for any serious cooking. If I had paid $149 I would return it in a heartbeat."
5,Great cook pan,I love this pan. It is great for cooking large amounts of food for a crowd.It is perfect for fried chicken and my husband loved it for making his spaghetti sauce.
1,2 pans -> 2 damaged pans -> poor product quality,"in defense of Amazon.com, the pan was not damaged during shipping. It appears that the nonstick surface has been gouged on both pans. I just got a refund. Poor Quality. Don't waste your time."
2,NOPE,"The lid did not come close to fitting, (the pan was misshapped), lid fit other pans fine, the bottom of pan was not flat & got worse when heat applied, have other cusinart stainless steel pans & they are fine, item returned. Amazon refunded quickly the price of pan & shipping, thank you amazon"
1,Don't buy.,The pan warped the first week of use. Not very sturdy and the non stick coating flakes easily. Don't buy.
5,Great pan,Very pleased with this pan. Great size and even temperature spread. To date no sticking and very easy to clean.
4,101 Ways to Reach Your Community,As entertaining as it was informative and inspiring. Recommend it for anyone interested in reaching out in their community. The ideas were well doumented and detailed.
5,A book for every small group or believer,"The first thing that I thought when I read this book is ""every small group in our church needs a copy!"". This is one of those remarkable books that can transform a church and the lives of a community.It gave me hundreds of ideas for evangelism in my community. It is truly a great and much needed book."
4,Ideas that really work!!,Sjogren has done a great job at putting together many of the ideas that have succesfully worked for their church. We are currently using several of the ideas directly out of the book in our situation and they work great. The simplicity and practicality of this book makes it well worth the investment.
4,"Excellent, unobtrusive, good purchase & price.","Nice low-profile, angled plug (cord goes to the right from the plug...so would be a negative if you needed it to go left--would be 5 stars if it could be flipped somehow or if there were two models as options), definitely white, 3-wire cord is a little wide by lies flat nicely on top of our 1/2 inch wide baseboards. Barely even notice it now!"
4,Slim is nice,I cut the socket end of this extension cord to use as power cord for a very quiet Panasonic exhaust fan for the bathroom that had to be surface mounted. The color matched the tiles in the room. The 16 gauge wires are sufficient to carry power to the fan which provided 18 gauge wires for connection in the built in junction box. I removed one star because I don't like the price.
5,Fits perfect,It is nice and sleek in designIt fits flat up against the wall outlet and the cord is flat!
5,Just what I needed.,I have bookshelves in front of my cable and electrical outlets. This was inexpensive and shpped very fast! I can now put back the shelves against the wall.
2,SHARK WEAK,"SHARK WEEK is yet another in the endless list of SyFy's sharkoramas.This time around, a psychotic drug lord (Patrick Bergin) and his sadistic girlfriend (the always laughable Yancey Butler) drug and kidnap the people Bergin holds responsible for his addict drug dealing son. The usual suspects: the son's best friend who was supposed to handle the sale; the undercover cop who managed the raid;the addict girlfriend; the judge and prosecutor; the investigative journalist who covered the story, and even the EMT who couldn't resuscitate the boy!SHARK NIGHT goes on forever with sappy dialogue and poorly staged shark attacks. Bergin's vengeful scheme is a game pitting the victims against various species of sharks from vicious pups (a hilarious scene) to the infamous great white.SHARK WEEK is interchangeable with all SyFy killer shark flicks and is barely watchable. But rest assured, there'll be more sharkfests coming!"
2,Disappointed,"This book gives a less than desirable description of each symbol. There is no mention of the author's background except that he is a researcher of symbols. It does not list his education and there is nothing in the way of footnotes, endnotes or a bibliography. Most ""researchers"" promote their sources of documentation, whereas we have to assume Mr. Cummings did his homework correctly and is giving us reliable information. I would not recommend this book if you're looking for any kind of expanded knowledge about symbols with documented sources."
1,badly edited,"There are many, many books on symbols and this one certainly does not stand out not withstanding the uninspired content, the editing (or lack thereof) is atrocious from numerous sentences with missing words to appalling grammar - I mean hectically bad - can't understand why the publishers would go to the trouble and cost of producing a book and not get it edited - it detracts from what may have been a worthwhile book. For example: ""... Bellerophon, the handsome young who was blessed... Its horrendous misuse of the English language make it an annoying book to read as on virtually every line there are errors. The book may have something to offer, however if the publishers haven't taken care with the edit it asks the question whether the author has taken time and care with his research."
3,Cross stitch design from India,"Although it seems intersting but I didn't find that much project to feed my hunger.the floss colors are in Anchor & when converted to DMC you will not find all the colorI'll start on the Indian elephant project, see you soon."
3,"very beautiful, for the advanced stitcher","I had high hopes for this book, and it delivered some. The designs are beautiful, but most of them quite large and for the very advanced stitcher. If you have a love for India and lots of time on your hands, this one is for you!"
4,Longest Beethoven #5 in the history of the universe?,"Tempos like Celibidache EMI, but with 1st and 4th movement repeats, make this a 39+ minute LvB #5. Of course it feels a lot more Teutonic and less (shall we say?) Buddhist. Except for a couple of Furtwanglerian pauses, the performance moves and it works. The Schubert is similar to Sinopoli Philharmonia. Sound quality is good radio broadcast stereo from 1968. Vienna Phil in good form; good balances and microphone placement; the timpani and cellos come through dramatically. With the tension of concert performances you get just a few audience noises and enthusiastic applause at the end of each symphony."
5,Watch Yourself With That Orgasmatron!,"Woody Allen's slapstick film in which he plays Miles Monroe who was inadvertently put into cryogenic freeze in 1973 after an ulcer operation. In addition to gags galore, the film is a humorous satire on the woes of modernity and technology.After being discovered from his robot disguise, Monroe joins a resistance movement that is opposed to the fascist regime in place ruled by only the dictator's nose. The regime is trying to reconstitute its leader from his nose and the resistance movement must stop their attempt. They are joined by a wealthy woman played by Diane Keaton.This is one of Woody Allen's best early films with a lot of slapstick and baffoonery. The film is light but manages to include some witty social commentaries in the form of satire. A great film for all ages."
3,Science Fiction version of Bananas,"__________________Sleeper is not Woody's best ""early, funny"" movie, and there's the same soapbox as Bananas, but even the look of the film is better. Although it wasn't just an excuse to set up a banana-peel gag, that scene is pretty d- funny. Some of the jokes have lost their timeliness, but that's the nature of jokes.Considering that Allen put out ""What's Up Tiger Lily"" and inspired (among other things) ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" (a concept that was tired the first day it aired, IMHO), it's not too much to claim that Allen also pioneered the sci-fi spoof with ""Sleeper"". This is a no-brainer, you will enjoy it, just buy it already.""Bananas"" is among Woody's worst, but if you liked that POS, you'd have to be completely brain-dead not to like Sleeper. People who are fans of ""Bananas"" are not really fans of Woody Allen as far as I'm concerned. I don't advocate prison sentences for that lot, but I do lean toward exile on some kind of island prison."
3,An Allen Mix,"Sleepers is an Allen movie with a little more. The one-liners are funny, the political jibes are funny, but the Mel Brooks humor and Benny Hill comedy is not part of an Allen movie."
3,Childish comedy from Woody Allen,"The Bottom Line:Made during Allen's less mature phase of including every gag he could think of in a film without regards for plot or consistency, Sleeper has a few laughs but its vision of the future dated quickly (as they tend to do) and its scattershot construction doesn't help matters--all things considered, it's a decidedly imperfect film from a director still learning about cinema.2.5/4"
3,Woody Allen Splapstick on So-So DVD,"Fans of Woody Allen's slapstick comedy should pick it up on this MGM DVD presentation.The transfer looks a bit soft and grainy throughout the film, but still better than VHS. The sound is presented in mono and that's okay for this Allen film.As far as bonus materials...there's a trailer.Kind of a clunker, but if you are in the market for the movie itself, pick it up."
4,Sleeper,"Woody Allen is Miles Monroe, owner of a health food store, frozen 200 years after entering the hospital for a routine operation. He awakens in a brave new world and must overthrow the repressive government. He is hilarious as he is in all his early films. His comedy derives from a willingness to laugh at himself. He defines comedy as ""tragedy plus time."" Woody was the Graucho Marx of his era. Comedy being relative, different generations laugh at different things. Would today's audiences laugh at the robot bit? Diane Keaton became his counterpart."
3,He should have just wrote songs instead,"Rock n' Roll Love Letter is a kick ass song for Tim Moore, not only for himself but for a number of groups such as The Records, but like the other reviewer, the rest of the other songs sounds like soap. Don't get me wrong, I like The Peppermint Rainbow, The Will-O-Bees, 3's a Crowd, The New Colony Six and Maureen MacGovern, It's just His style of writing songs seems to be fitting for someone else to perform. That's all. OK, for the DUDE that did'nt vote for Me it's like this, He reminds Me of Paul Williams, good WRITER but BAD SINGING, OK????? Like the movie What every happen to Baby Jane!!!!!!!!!! Buy the way, You know how I have the song Rock' n Roll Love Letter set up on my computer. After His song it's Saturday Night by the Bay City Rollers and after that song is Go Bananas by The Banana Splits! You get My DRIFT!!!!!!!!!"
2,Cheap Guitar,"Bought this for our son for Christmas. The strings are flimsy, and the strap only fastens to the guitar in 1 place - at least on the one we received. It sounds terrible even with the strings tightened. If your child is really interested in having something that resembles music come from a guitar, don't buy this one. It's very cheap."
2,Kid's Acoustic Toy Guitar,"My grandson loved the guitar, but sadly it broke the first day. Not worth the money for this toy. The glue broke at the neck where it connects to the body of the guitar. His dad is going to glue it back and it will probably be better than new."
4,Just what I wanted,"I purchased the drill press several months ago and have had many opportunities to put it to use. The first thing I noticed was the condition of the packing container when it arrived. Trashed. You would think a piece of heavy machinery would be packed in more than styrofoam. Putting it together is a challenge for one person. Everything else went smoothly until I went to tilt the table. There is no mention in the instruction manual as the the size of the wrench necessary to loosen the bolt to turn the table let alone a wrench included. I went to the local tool shop that sold this same item and they didn't know either. When we called the authorized service center we got the same responce. ""Don't know"". All in all a great tool. This is one of many tools I have purchased from Amazon.tool crib and I couldn't be happier with the speed and customer service."
5,Oustanding home shop drill press.,"I ordered this particular drill press for the home shop after reading the other reviews. It is perfect. A lot of drill press for the money. Affordable power for the home shop. Packed very well, had it together in an hour. I put it together by myself, but a second person makes it very easy. I like the table, easy to clamp jigs and projects."
4,Excellent drill press...,"Overall, very solid and well built. I am very happy with my purchase, and the free attachment was a great bonus. It was extremely easy to set up, and the manual is good.The good:Built solidEasy to use and adjustVery quietStrong motorThe bad:The table (built my own out of 3/4 baltic birch and it's fantastic.That's it really, it's a great addition to my shop"
4,It's a good tool,This drill press is a good quality drill press. There are some improvements I would like to see. Its closest competitor is made by JET. The below are features that you get with JET (maybe that should be their slogan) that I would like to see with this Delta drill press. Delta needs: A TEFC totally enclosed fan motor to prevent overheating from sucked in saw dust. A larger table. A deeper cutting depth. An improvement in the smoothness of sliding the table out of the way. The current configuration causes the geared rail to bind with the tool base.All in all I do recommend this tool as a contender. Some of the accessories could use some improvements. The mortising attachment fence setup is not very sturdy and difficult to adjust. The oscillating sander is not the easiest to setup and remove.
4,Satisfied with Delta Drill Press,"Delta Drill Press is all I expected. Performs well. Would have liked a retainer clip to hold chuck-tightner wrench to keep from misplacing it. Othewise, okay."
4,Nice press,"I've enjoyed using my drill press so far. I haven't really run it through all of it's paces but so far it's done a nice job. My only complaint about it is that there was quite a bit of rust on the part that you attach the chuck to. I was quite surprised by this and a little disappointed. I was able to remove most of it and it's not too big of a deal, but why would there be any rust on a brand new drill press??? Other than that, it's easy to use, powerful enough for my needs, and the free mortising kit is a nice bonus. If not for the rust, I'd have given it 5 stars."
3,"good product, no accessory",great drill press but amazon didn't ship the 'free mortising attachment $69.99 value' that was promised in the ad.
4,Touch of rust & annoying rattle,"I've had great experiences ordering through Amazon. The drill,along with a Delta Unisaw, were delivered to my garage on time andintact. I'm now a regular customer.The drill did have a little rust behind the spindle, but cleaned up easily with steel wool. I too am disconcerted about the rattle of the plastic pulley/belt cover. Surely Delta engineers could make a minimal change to eliminate it. I took care of it myself by putting some self adhesive foam on the inside of the cover, between the hinges. Now it sounds as smooth and quiet as one would expect.I also had trouble getting 3/4"" plywood under the base, as recommended; it should be attached BEFORE assembling the head. BTW, don't try to get the oscilating spindle sander attachment for this model--it won't work."
3,Dedicated Drill Press,"I've owned this drill press about 2 years now, having purchased through Amazon.com. I'm very pleased with the operation of the machine. The delivery of the press left something to be desired as Amazon shipped via Eagle who delivered in a truck without a lift gate. As the entire package was significantly beyond my capability to get it out of the truck alone (driver was unhelpful), this was a major pain. Once in my shop, setup was typical of a woodworking machine. The drill press is excellent, the setup is normal, the shipping was poor."
4,Workhorse,"I bought this drill press because of the long spindle travel. This travel means I don't have to adjust the table height as often. I find the table size to be adequate. If I need something bigger I can easily attach my own table. It would be nicer if the table tilt could be adjusted without tools though.The only gripe I have is the vibration. You don't feel vibration but at certain speeds the top vibrates and makes a lot of noise. I contacted Delta and while nice to talk to they had no fix for the noise. It doesn't bother me enough to be upset about it.I use this drill almost every day and, except for the rattle, it has been a joy to use."
4,Not Flawless,"I didn't hear the rattling that some other reviewers complained of, but I did have a problem with setting up the Delta mortising attachment. The instructions plainly say ""no special setup required"" yet you have to move the stop collar about 1 1/4 inches to allow for the mortising attachment I bought separately to fit. Not a big deal but when going back to regular duty drilling, you either have to reset the stop collar or give up the inch and a quarter. I chose to give up the length so I could easily switch between operations. Other than that, it is a very solid drill. Speeds are easy to change. All moving parts are solid and smooth."
3,Ferlin Husky,"Disappointed with this CD. Must have been recorded late in his life, very poor quality, poor singing. His songs did not sound like I remember them as a kid. Every body gets old, but don't sell recordings as though they were the original cuts."
3,Good for What It Is,"Ferlin Husky produced a small number of crossover Country to Rock hits. Among them, Gone is an exceptional Roots-Rock ballad. But the rest of the album is pretty mediocre Country. So if you want easy access to Gone and a couple other Ferlin Husky hits, buy the CD. If you want an album that you can sit back and enjoy all the way through, this isn't the one for you."
5,MMA Fanatics Review,"I have to say this book is quite awsome, not just from a Amatuer Wrestling stand point, but Also from a self defense stand point. Oddly in MMA circles we devote huge amounts of time into studying Freestyle takedowns. We often over look the value of Basic Greco tactics. I found the adive on where to grab your oppoent for control to be worth the price of the book. Combine what you read in this book with some Boxing, low kicks, and a few submissions you will have a formatible repitore. Still I have to say this is a book, not a video. If you can't put whats going on together in your mind you might want to but the US coaches syllsbus."
3,"quite ok, except the knife","I have had this knife for about a year.The pliers are quite good for the size.The knife is really bad. Sharpening did not help. I had a Victorinox for 6 years before this one, they cant be compared.If you really need pliers or don't care for the blunt blade, then it is quite usable. Otherways go for Victorinox."
3,useful lessons from antiquated computer designing,"Kidder's prize-winning bestseller fascinates because it succeeds to capture creativity as integrated in an extremely profit-oriented organization. At the same time, we are talking here of designing a computer in 1979 - really an antiquated period, from our present point of view, especially computerwise. However, antiquated as the computer they design may seem to us, the interactions and processes in the high-pressure atmosphere of Data General's young men's thinking tank (hardly any women!) are still interesting to us today. Whether you're in HRM or in some creative occupation, you will find fascinating notions in this book. If you are a decision maker on funding innovation projects, read this book to find the ideal profile of your risk-manager. Always wanted to know what ""mushroom-management"" really means? Read this.Hans Stegeman"
4,Great for IT Professionals,"For IT professionals looking to understand more about how projects were run in the 70s (to compare that with how projects are run today), this book is great. A fine read. The key thing here is that although the technology has changed since the 70s, the management and team structures depicted in _The Soul of a New Machine_ could be in place today. For better or worse. This book should be read by any IT professional who is looking to be part of a technical product team. If only to better understand technical team dynamics."
4,Good read,"Nicely written. A good, quick read. I'd recommend it for anyone interested in the history of the computer industry."
5,Good book. A must for a novice yet to enter this field,"The book really goes on to show, what it takes to put life in the machine.The author does a great job in addressing the various issues of project development and management."
3,The Soul of a New Machine,The contents of the book are out of date. It describes the computer technology in the 70s and 80s in great details. I found it boring and quit reading in the middle of the book.
4,Time capsule,"I found this book to be a very interesting analysis of the development lifecycle of a new computer. What made it even more interesting was the fact that it is now twenty years old, which makes it practically prehistoric by computer industry standards, yet the intensity and method of attack have really not changed all that dramatically for the developers. It's like going back in a time capsule to a fascinating period in this industry. Also adding to the story was the level of access that Data General gave to the author. I would be very surprised if that would happen today, but it adds a level of knowledge that really draws the reader into the story. There were some humorous moments too - I loved the Mushroom Theory of Management: ""Feed them s**t, put 'em in a dark room, and see what grows"". Terrific stuff!"
5,Read this book if you think you have what it takes to work in a start up,"I first read this book many years ago when I was working in a cutting edge computer start up. Seven start ups later, it still provides an accurate picture of that wild, exciting, demanding place called a start up."
4,What was past is relevant today,I found the book very insightful from both a business managerial and information age perspective. My understanding of how computers work is enhanced and the social complexities of an organization under pressure to deliver was well captured. Great read and not mired in geeky vocabulary. On to Mountains Beyond Mountains...
1,boring and poorly written,"I have a strong computer background. I am an engineer not a writer, but how this could have gotten a Pulitzer Prize is beyond me. It is so poorly written that I had to force myself to finish it as I was sure it would pick up in the end....it did not. I cant even recommend it to a single friend in the industry as it really has nothing to say other that a lot of sweat went in this development, but again if you have been involved in any cutting edge development project they are not 9-5 jobs....so what is new. Sorry I spent my time. Perhaps it needs context to appreciate it. The development was fantastic but the book was equality not up to it."
2,FYI: Size of each cone form,"Rated 2 stars because product description didn't include actual size or the material.Material I think is stainless steel because magnets stick to it.Size of each cone is 1-1/4"" at largest outer diameter and 5"" long. I wanted something w/ an outer diameter of 2"", but these would be fine if you want hors d'ouevre sized cream hors. Can't return or I'd get smacked $5.17 for return fees :-P"
3,These forms are not quite what I wanted for a few reasons,"I have been looking for these bakeware ""tubes."" These forms are not quite what I wanted for a few reasons.First, they are sharp and you have to be very careful not to cut yourself.Second, cones' angle is too wide and the dough slides down from the mold during baking making final inside volume too small for filling. It would be nice if they were longer and also had a smaller cone angle, or better yet if they were truncated cones: with the tip of the cone being cut off allowing for more space inside for the cream and the dough will not slip from the shape during baking.Positive: take up little storage space, easy to wash in the machine, not expensive"
5,Cream Horn Molds,Very high quality molds. I purchased these for a 2011 Christmas gift to give along with a Cuisinart Pizelle Press. Amazon shipped both items together. I received them very quickly. I highly recommend these molds as they are of high quality and will last many years.
1,not satisfied,"I was so not satisfied with the product, it is cheap made, i cut myself washing it because the horns were not properly constructed.so dissapoineted, i wish i could return them, but im not sure about their return policy."
2,Great Recorder Zero Technical Support,"This CD recorder is very nicely engineered and has a robust CD burner.One major problem is the total lack of any meaningful technical support.The owners manual was apparently translated directly from Japanese. So, many parts of this are extremely difficult to understand. Worse, if you call or Email Denon tech support they are unable to answer even simple questions.My machine will record fine off an outside source (record, tape etc) but will not copy CDs of any type or any length. I keep getting the same error message ""CDR-short"".Denon customer service knows nothing about this product and the manual does not address this problem.I have never been able to copy a CD with this machine, although I have made hundreds of copies using other CD recorders.Prospective buyers are cautioned that you are on your own if you have problems with Denon equipment."
5,Over a year old and I still love this unit.,I love this CD recorder. Everything with one exception is totally awesome. There is no shutoff on the remote. It is solid state and I do leave it on for days sometimes but I really would like a shutoff switch on the remote. As far as quality and ease of use...mine was a refurbished unit and I've never had a single glitch. The recording quality is superb and the sound level and metering is dead on with my two Sony MD decks and my other Pioneer CD recorder. The Pioneer has a few more features but the Denon is my go to machine. I use the pioneer mainly for playback now. There is a learning curve but I myself found the Denon to be very intuitive. It dupes wonderfully and if you have some copy protection you have to get by you can do a completely analog dupe in real time.
1,Not for Turntable Recording,"I bought this equipment thinking I could record my LP's until I read on page 7 under notes: Do not make a connection to the PHONO jack of the amplifier. Doing so will lead to breakdown. All I needed was my turntable, amplifier and a cd recorder which were not too popular at that time. The Operating Instructions Manual is thorough and complete."
5,NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART,"There isn't anything subtle about Lisa Angelle! In your face sensuality, and no beating about the bush. This lady sings HOT! If your CD player doesn't have steam coming out of it when you play it, better check, something is wrong. I first caught the Video on CMT and was totally mesmerized by it. Got the Single and was mesmerized again. ""Midnight Rodeo"" is just as hot as ""I Wear Your Love"" The Dance Mix is actually better than the album cut (for a change). Will be buying ""Twisted"" as soon as it comes out."
5,"So, where's the CD?","I saw Lisa's IWYL video on CMT and bugged Wherehouse and Tempo Records until they finally stocked her CD single. She is truly mesmerizing and the added video footage on her CD only made me anticipate the release of her full CD --- which hasn't happened. Well, I have been bugging Wherehouse now for over five months. What gives? Let me just sign, ""Anxiously Waiting in Simi""."
5,"I LOVED IT, AND WANT TO HERE MORE OF LISA ANGELLE. SHE'S HOT","I WAS SPEECHLESS WHEN I FIRST SEEN IT. I CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT. I CANT WAIT TO GET THE CD. HURRY AND GET IT HERE.I HOPE EVERYBODY LIKES IT, AND WE GET TO KEEP HER 4 EVER.I KNOW I WILL, IN MIND AND HEART."
5,LISA ANGELLE IS A STAR!,"I loved ""I Wear Your Love!"" She has my full attention - especially after checking out her website and hearing some more of her CD ""TWISTED!"" Check it for yourself - LISAANGELLE.COM - just awesome!"
5,Collectable!,"I have'nt seen these episodes much. But if you love the original episodes, get it! The last episode is what I consider to be the last true episode before USA changed it up!"
2,Season 8 of TMNT,"At this moment, this is the last Season of Turtles that got to get a release date while there's still two more seasons that still need to be released of the original series. While this season was one of the seasons that featured less than 10 episodes and in which started taking the show in a different but darker feel to it. With the new turn around in the series, this was the season and onward in which I never got to watch cause of not being able to catch the show on in my area at this particular season. Although I wish that after this season set was released that the other 2 season sets got a release so that way some of us fans can have at least all the episodes amongst our DVD collections. We may have to wait to see what Nickelodeon does with them owning the franchise to see what they'll do with this series. Overall this set gets a 2.5 stars out of 5."
3,Atmospheric page-turner,"Not particularly scary but immediately engaging, with well-drawn characters. Very readable."
2,Cover blurb oversells the contents,"The cover makes this story sound like a real thriller but it is kind of weak when it comes to scariness, and the plot is pretty thin. To make matters worse, the copy I picked up at a ""honor system"" rack in a commuter train station lacks the last 6 pages so I am bereft of the words indicating how it comes out, but based on what I read in the first 325 pages I'm not all that enthusiastic to lay hands on a complete copy to see if my guess on outcome is correct. The characterization of Rachel Levy is the strongest part, the rest of the characters are painted pretty shallow. Overall, any Steven Saylor, Clive Cussler, or Agatha Christie title beat this one by a mile."
4,Last chance to get XP !,"I work in industrial automation, where almost all software runs on XP, practically only a few manufacturers have stable versions of all their software for newer Vista OS. So... get your XP copies while they last!"
4,Review,"You can make your computer more efficient by using windows XP professional SP2, in place of any home edition.Compare to windows XP home, XP-professional is more secure, reliable and fast with more in built security and efficiency enhancement options."
4,XP Hype,"Needed a copy of XP for my son's computer - this filled the bill at a good price. Me, I am a Mac guy - no more blue screens and hours of downloading updates."
4,Not bad for Windows,"ME, CE, 95, 98, 2000 all blew and XP was the only good one out of the lot. Vista also sucks beyond words so don't bother with it. XP takes 1.5 GB to run itself, Vista takes 40GB thats insane. Just use XP or better yet use Mac OS X. Linux Ubuntu is ok too if you have a masters in computer science to get it to connect to the internet."
3,Good but expensive,"In my opinion, this is the most stable and reliable release of Windows, with an excellent peripheral drivers assortment. Nonetheless the price is still a little too high for the quality."
4,Yeah its XP,"Just as it says on the box. Wish MS (amongst many other multinationals) could treat the Aus consumer better, would have liked to buy this locally but no option."
3,A Necessary Evil,Glad I use a MAC most of the time. Using Windows is like steping back in time 10 0r 12 years.
3,The usual,"Unfortunately I have to use Windows for some of my CAD programs.With a dual boot (bootcamp) Mac pro it works just fine.Windows XP SP2 installs easily from the disk, but its a pain to update as each update spawnsa need for another update. A total of 4 successive updates to get up to date to SP4 et alia.It would be nice if Microsoft/Amazon sold the SP4 release instead of the SP2 releasebut such is life..."
1,Windows Support to end.,"To All Beware:Microsoft end of support date is just 602 days away from the date of this posting. What this means is that there will be no more security updates for this platform and or fixes. If you are wanting to install a new system to a computer, I would recommend Windows 7. Or if you can wait for a couples of months Windows 8 will be released to the public, there is going to be a limited time special on the pricing with the first release. Either choice is up to the individual, I would just suggest doing some research on the net before you make a decision.Here is the link for the countdown gadget. [...]And the link for reference [...]"
2,Used not New,"I recieved the product in a timely manner however the box, which was listed as ""new"" on the website was in fact opened and the key code was no good. I had to call windows customer support to gain a new key code for the disk. I know that with software such as this, once it is used it can no longer be applied to a different computer so I was wary of purchasing it on-line to begin with. Now I feel my concerns were justified and don't feel that I will buy software from amazon again."
2,"Best windows yet, but......","This is Microsoft's most stable OS yet, but ridiculously over- priced. I'll admit, I'm no fan of Microsoft, but I've very few problems with my desktop once I upgraded from Windows me."
1,Now using a mac,"This computer system, although almost universally accepted, can be beaten in quality and flexibility by an operating system that can be downloaded for free, such as the fedora project (a distribution of linux, a OS which can be changed by anyone for free), or bought from software company supporting these open source project with unlimited customer support for around 50 ($90) or less."
1,I can't believe I own this piece of junk...,"I was raised with the understanding that ""if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all,"" but Amazon prompted me for a review... so I feel the need to remind everyone what a terrible load of horse crap this Windows XP really is. I can't believe that so many people around the world suffer with it every day.I bought the ""Professional FULL VERSION with SP2"" to install as a 2nd system on my Intel Mac (so that I can author/test files I create in a PC environment). Yikes. How is this worth $[...]? I think Leopard is going to be $[...]Anyway, this isn't a very good review, but it isn't a very good operating system either."
3,WINDOWS XP PRO,A BIT PRICEY for an opeating system ... WINDOWS XP PRO is excellent ... but I think Mr Bill is gouging too much dough. One hundred dollar price tag would be a bit more humane ... to have 50 billions is a bit redundand is dishuman ...
1,not worth the agrivation involved in the setup,Ok so I bought this horrible waste of time and money to repair an old computer that my dad gave me to keep my larger files seperate from my school stuff. i had to repair the hard drive but that in itself was simple. my issue is with the utter complication of getting this installed. i had ubuntu on the desktop running ok but i needed windows to run my internet service and both my mp3 player and my girlfriends. alas i have been stuck with a lingering black screen everytime i try to install. my guess is that i have to download drivers. or wipe the hard drive but get this microsoft is still stuck in the stone age and requires me to use 3.5 inch floppy discs in order to make a boot disk. i'm still trying to install it and will continue until i succeed but beware that there is little support both from other users and certainly from microsoft
1,and the difference is???,"To purchase XP Professional or XP Home that was the question having already purchased two editions of XP Home, decided to try XP Pro... for what??? because it is named Professional? Oh well, if it wasn't for not being able to port some rather specialized software apps, it would be a no-brainer... GET FEDORA CORE!!! and leave M$ products to those that want to have something to always have to worry about..! If you are not upgrading to Vista, and need to keep XP... use the Home edition. Pro is not worth the difference in cost...really."
2,My Windows XP copy is more advanced.,"My Windows XP Professional system is more advanced. So, I was not able to use Windows XP Professional Full Version with SP2. Can I return or replace what I have purchased from you? Best regards and God bless."
1,Defective Product,"I ordered the product and it was shipped in a timely manner. Unfortunately, the product was defective and I could not use it. I contacted the seller, returned the product and my money was immediately refunded. Will purchase again from Seller if the opportunity arises."
1,Unhappy,I haven't received it yet! I submitted a request for information and haven't even received a reply.
1,Windows runs my life--and I don't want it to,"Over and over again I find that Windows limits what I can do. I am on a very secure network and I want to open up files on my old computer to my new computer. But Microsoft knows better and won't allow me to open up My Documents or System files to my other computer. Isn't this my decision?And now I'm trying to move fonts from my old computer to my new one. Since these are in a system folder, Microsoft won't let me connect to them. And when I try to copy them, it changes the files, so they won't install. And now that I've tried simply moving them, it has destroyed the files so I don't have them on either computer.I sincerely hope that Google or somebody else comes out with an operating system that doesn't try to think for you. I am really disgusted with Microsoft, but they have their fingers around our necks and won't let go."
3,Think before Bay,"I order because of the price. I have received in time!! Whan I open the box I found glue on the reading surface. I try to wash but not success. I return the box(without compensation for the cost of shippment returning) and I received a replacement. This time the CD reading surface ok - Hologramic surface exfoliating. I was able to install with few errors and to make a secure copy! At activation OK, at Updating surprize!!!!!! NON GENUINE!!!!! I start calling Microsoft and after 3 days I had receive a second activation KEY. (ON CD HOLOGRAM IT IS NOT SHOWING GENUINE) Now all it is OK. From the first purchase until I have instaled it pass 72 days!!!!!! Wellcome to Microsoft Quality Product!!!"
4,Running it on my mac,"While Windows generally has been a klunky interface, XP is really finally one of the more finished products from MS. I just recently upgraded to the MacBook Pro and with Parallels I'll finally be able to work with the very few Windows applications that I need. It works great with Parallels."
4,Windows...the 500 lb gorilla,"I have an Intel Mac and will tell you that system 10 is a heck of alot easier to use. However there are times when you need a windows machine. Get boot camp from Apple for free and then buy a copy of windows xp service pack 2 and you can run just like a champ on the windows format. This copy from amazon worked without a hitch and low an behold the 500 lb gorilla was there and running. Oh yes, get a two button mouse! Macs use a one button mouse which limits you greatly when using windows."
5,XP The Way To Go,I am very glad I upgraded to Windows XP. I was able to resolve some immediate problems I was having with Windows 2000 and my computer works much better. The upgrade required some professional expertise but has been well worth it. I would recommend this upgrade to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Windows system
1,The XP is for eXtra Painful,"As I had commented earlier, my biggest business demand is for people wanting to upgrade to Win 2000 from Win XP. I have seen people scream at the XP operating system. I have seen people get peeved with their ""helpful"" relatives who had upgraded their system from Win 98 or Win 2000 without their knowledge. XP is slow, buggy, instrusive and easily infected. It is the leper and syphilic of OS's. Do yourself a favor for your business and your family peace. Avoid XP at all costs. All those other people recommeding XP on other websites(Present Amazon company excluded. I am convinced of their sincerity!), makes me wonder if this is astroturf marketing from Redmond."
1,a bloated unsecure dominator,"Sorry to disappoint the believers, but this OS is way overpriced for what it does. And, it will dominate you instead of the converse."
1,difference between this one and the old one,I would really like to know the difference between the 2002 version Microsoft Windows XP Professional and this one.
2,Oscar G Is Capbable of a Much Better Set,"The anticipation was killing me as I waited for the new release from Murk (comprised of Oscar G....resident of Space 34 in Miami and Ralph Falcon....longtime friend of Oscar G.) Finally the cd arrived and ugh....what a disappointment. The vocals on this one are horrible. Remember back in the day when Darude churned out several formula songs that tried to recapture the magic of Sandstorm?? This is that same crap-o-la formula applied to Murk's ""Dark Beat"" on this garbage dump. The only saving song that even remotely tries to break new ground is ""Baba Sulei""....a very interesting track that conjures up the best of tribal and hard house. As for the rest of the tunes....they get old after the first play....you won't keep this one around very long....either you'll lose it under your good cd's or if you're smart you'll try to pawn it off on the local used CD store !!"
1,Murk Muck,"Excellent example of below-average, low-tempo, techno/dance music that's boring and goes on FOREVER... Four of the ""songs"" are seven minutes or longer and three of the others are in the six minute range. It seems like they'll never end. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen in the music, but it never does. My advice is to look elsewhere."
3,"Kick ass... while, whats there...","So Sam and Dave rock. You probabaly wouldnt be reading this if you disagreed. Im not sure if its just my copy of the cd or what, but mine is only 18 tracks. Im pritty sure if your going to entitle it ""25 Greatest Hits,"" you owe the listener at least 25 tracks. The tracks can suck, but there has to at least be 25 tracks there.Aside from this small problem, the cd is great. It has some of their biggest well known hits, along with a few great songs Ive never hurd them do prior to this purchase. I would deffinitly recomend purchaseing this cd, just beware that it may only contain the first 18 tracks. :p"
3,My review of small book Jeff Buckley,I love this book and when I had time read it on Jeff buckley !Great for Jeff Buckley fan on a good book to read !
4,Freezing Frame Watching Hinalka slap the blind guy,"Let alone that Joe Monks can play a sighted guy, but I couldn't help freeze framing and rewinding to see his reaction when Hinalka kept slapping him.Chance Meeting is a creepy tale. Having read the original story, the film version varies but still gives you that punch in the gut. Joe Monks is on his way up, cause he's one of the best horror writers around."
4,Must Read: For Old South and Old Southwest Research,"For historians or family researchers interested in thesocial history of the frontier and settlement periodof the old South and old Southwest (as in Kentucky, Indiana)this book is a valuable asset.There are vivid descriptions and intense research;theauthor has stated, ""The Dixie Frontier was one of the mostromantic and heroic of the entire continent."" The bookcovers daily life, customs,attitudes, practices - allphases of pioneer living of squatters, planters, slaves,the women,medicine,speech,religion, etc. It's a bookto keep on the shelf for frequent reference."
1,BAD DESCRIPTION,"IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PAGE SAYS THE FOLLOWING THING: Comes in 4 per blister card or Bulk without packaging. And ONLY 20 ARTICLES SENT ME NO BLISTER OF 4 EACH ON, BAD DESCRIPTIONLightsticks Green Bulk"
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased this as a replacement item for a plate I broke and was very diappointed in the quality. The plate is out of round, thicker and heavier, and the painting is inferior. It was made in Malaysia. My original set was made in the USA. If I need other replacement pieces, I will try to buy them used. I used to think Pfaltzgraff was a good and reliable brand. I also need to note that the service from Amazon and its supplier was excellent - it was just a bad product."
2,Pfaltzgraff Salad Plates Made in China,I like the size of the plates. I am concerned about the one I received as a replacement. It's made in China -- should I worry about lead paint? And it's much heavier than other plates. I'm not impressed!
5,Graph tech nut,"it works great with any stratocaster model, no only for Fender's guitar. This product match really good with the graph tech saddles."
5,Make sure you get the right one for your model,"Bought two of these Tusq nuts for my Dlx Player Strats. Looked online to verify the correct nut style and still had to do some filing to make it fit. Take the old nut off carefully (per instructions) and keep as a filing guide. The nut does what is says. Pre-lubrication means no annoying sounds when adjusting string tension. I do feel that it does increase harmonic tonality as claimed too. NOTE: I also added a set of Fender locking tuners for added stability.(BTW, Tusq are also now available in white. See Stewart-MacDonald website & search: Tusq.)"
3,Quality Control Problems,"For what it's worth, the video itself is quite good. Faithful to the book, for the most part."
1,WARNING!!! Do NOT but this DVD!!!!!,"I am a big fan of all things Disc World and I bought this DVD as soon as it became available but have had nothing but trouble I have had FOUR copies of this dvd trying to get one that worked and EVERYONE had the EXACT same problems!!! And I tried them all in 3 different DVD players, all four suffer from pixelation and the third episode will not play AT ALL on all four dvds!!! I would not have bothered with this warning if all four hadn't suffered from the exact same problems which points to errors in the making of the dvds, I hope they get this fixed as soon as possible."
2,It's just not good.,"While very slightly better than the animated version of Wyrd Sisters, this one is still pretty poor. Poor artwork and animation, poor voicework, with a few exceptions. Save your money for the next Discworld book."
3,"Good story, poorly done DVD","Soul Music is a faithful and entertaining version of Terry Pratchett's Soul Music, part of the Death subseries of Discworld books. It is also an amusing pastiche of the history of rock and roll. However, the designers of the DVD made a really dumb decision. Soul Music is made up of a series of episodes. At the end of each episode, you must return to the main menu, select the next chapter, and then play it (and each starts with a short recap of what came before). There is no way to just watch the whole thing from start to finish (something you could do in the previous Discworld DVD, Wyrd Sisters). Why, oh why, did they do something so dumb?"
4,"Good, but long, and broken up into episodes","I am a huge Pratchett fan, and thought that this DVD captured the essence of the book (as well as it can, being only dialog, not the satire of Pratchett's narrative). It was nearly 3hrs long without the special features (interview w/Pratchett, etc), and divided into 7 episodes, which one had to manually go back from the title screen and replay."
3,Science of Getting Rich,"This book is the retitled, Science of Getting Rich, by the same author. Is this the secret? Some good principles along with some bones. Like a good filet of fish, partake of the good, spit out the bones. I don't ask the universe, I ask the God of the Universe."
4,"Easy reading, but too simple to be true?","I thought the book dispensed some very thought provoking ideas. Some which may cause many people great distress, like avoiding at all costs your competitive nature in life and in business. I think some others will not 'get' the author's message of how to accomplish the goal of financial success. I do believe in his prescribed method for success and enjoyed the book, I just wonder if the idea is too simple too be true."
5,A tasty morsel!,"The first release (1990) by this dynamic Boston jazz pianist and composer. Swinging tunes by a swinging trio, with guest appearances by the legendary Herb Pomeroy."
2,So disappointed,"Having 'cut my teeth' on southern gospel with its simple arrangements and heartfelt vocals, I was so disappointed to listen to this slickly produced album of Ira Stanphill's music. His melodies were beautiful and his lyrics so meaningful, but this album with strange philharmonic arrangements behind the voices was just plain jarring. The effect was somewhat like the latest Gaither Homecoming videos - lots of production values but little sincere, real feeling. Wish they had recorded the album at some little Georgia church instead of a big production studio - it would have been a better reflection of the impact of Ira Stanphill's words and music on the 'little people'. As a comparison, listen to LaBreeska Hemphill sing ""Mansion Over the Hilltop"" on the ""Down at the Tabernacle"" Gaither CD and you will know what I mean."
5,Success,"Bought this for my Mum as a gift, as I'd heard her talking of reading Wilhelm Hauff tales during her primary school years in The Netherlands where she grew up. Great success for a gift as she totally loves it. Although this book is in English, it doesn't matter as the stories are the same and I can tell there's a lot of memories comming back for her."
4,Best hiking guide to MRNP,"For hiking, as opposed to climbing, I thought this was a great book. It was easy to read, well-organized, and informative. It was certainly better than Ira Spring's ""50 Hikes"" book.The two authors spent a whole summer just hiking all over Mt. Rainier National Park, and then wrote about what they found. Entertaining and informative."
3,In need of some serious editing,"This book is for beginning programmers only and also in need of some serious editing.I have to agree with other comments which describe this as a poorly written book. I have read other Wrox books and have enjoyed them. This book is torturously wordy. Annoying, unfunny jokes and quips abound. (as opposed to ""fine ham"") I found myself skipping/speed-reading entire paragraphs and pages just to get to the meat of the subject. Fortunately, once you do find the meat, the book seems very helplful.If you have experience in programming and want a book that quickly brings you up to speed on XML and its associated technologies, this is NOT the book. Try O'Reilly's XML in a Nutshell instead."
2,Sadly short,"I purchased this book in the hopes that it would, in fact, be a book. NOPE. It's a bound collection of pictures with a small, gloss-the-surface ""story"" about the history of the originators--Black Sabbath. I'm still waiting for a ""book"" book. One without pictures and quotes from more than one band member (like the ""Oral History"" thing), much like one of the many Led Zeppelin books. (""Hammer of the Gods"" was pretty good). Anyway, I guess I'll keep waiting."
1,Should have come with a coloring book!,"This book was written for those who are either brain dead or in the 1st-4th grade. Decent photos, but a lot of discrepencies with the facts. No real interviews from those who matter. If you are buying this for your young son or daughter, or someone who just learned how to read, this book is perfect, but it insults the intellegence for pretty much the rest of the world. It was a total waste of money, IMO. Skip it!!"
1,"It's in the Subtitle, Stupid!","I should have paid attention to the subtitle: ""When Science and Religion Merge."" Well, they don't. They can't. I can't believe I was suckered.I'll grant that the ""scientific method"" and ""mythology"" are very different intellectual pursuits. I'll even grant they differ in the prism of the world they see. I'll even grant that they offer complimentary perspectives, at least if one accepts polysemy.But they don't and cannot ""merge."" The ""fairy tale"" is that someone believes that they can, namely Rigas. It was there in the title! The scientific method and resurrection of the body cannot merge. They are contradictions! Neither ""FITS"" the other. What a terrible waste I could have prevented.I'll look closer in the future. This is my error. I know better, and yet curiosity got the better of me. The subtitle should have been an obvious warning. Curiosity can sometimes overlook the obvious. I have and did."
2,"Really, it is","""Non-Violent Taekwondo Troopers"" is perhaps the greatest pop song ever recorded, better even than ""In My Life"", ""What You Do to Me"", ""Lexicon Devil"", or "" Be My Baby"". Caglar Juan Singletary (and Art Kaufman) have given something of real beauty to the world. Sublime."
5,A wonderful book for all teens,"Leslie has always had an A+ life. But it all comes crumbling to pieces when Leslie starts trying to be the perfect person. And being the perfect person, means being thin in Leslie's world. It all begins when Leslie gets the flu. She loses several pounds and is then motivated to go on a diet. But her going on a diet would eventually turn her life upside down.Second Star to the Right shows what it's like inside the mind of a young teenager struggling with anorexia. After reading this book I was shocked that this happens to teenage girls like myself. I was aware that one of my classmates was anorexic and after reading this book I had an eye-opening view of what it's really like for someone struggling with this life-threatening disease."
3,Okay.,"Another library copy without any mention of such in the description. I'm not too thrilled with that.As for the book, it was just okay. I was really looking forward to it, but it was kind of bland. To be honest, I can't remember much about it after reading it. I guess I had hoped there would be more of the fantasy, day-dream, safety-from-reality neverland implied from the title.Not awful though, I sat down and read the whole thing at once.Quick read."
2,A Novella that was just so-so.,"This is no a book- at 155 pages it is more like a Novella. Although the book covers the subject, it does not draw you in to the main character and at no point do you see her as anything other than a spoiled, selfish, self-indulgent child who thinks she is selfless. I did not empathize with her. Additionally, the book just ends very oddly. It really was not good by today's standards."
3,"Not as bad as some, not as good as others","First: this is not a BAD book. It's not too poorly written, and it generally holds one's interest, although the narrator can be wordy.However, it's not a good book, either, or memorable. It reminds one of The Best Little Girl in the World by Steven Levenkron, as many have noted, and not in a good way. It feels like a repeat of Best Little Girl, but less frightening. As someone who has struggled with an eating disorder, I can say that it is not particularly triggering. It is also not very hope-inspiring. My overall impression of the book is blaaahh.Save your money and see if your library has it. You're never going to want to read it twice."
4,A good book,"I did enjoy this book when I read it at 15. However, I have given it 4 stars because I didn't feel the beginning was as strong as it could be as it seemed rather slow getting going.But the rest of the book is great. The descriptions of anorexia are excellent. I remember being frustrated by the ending though because I was left thinking, ""But happened then?"" but I guess that's a sign of a good book!"
3,"Interesting, but destructive","I first read Second Star to the Right when I was 13 and suffering from a severely distorted body image. I had just begun to have trouble with eating and was about to plunge into full-blown anorexia. While the book provides a very real account of anorexia, I used it for inspiration (not the intended purpose) and copied some of Leslie's ""tricks"" to make myself sicker. Rather than providing a hopeful, recovery-centered novel, I thought that the book glamorized anorexia and made me feel special because I was sick...I think that Ms. Hautzig could have made eating disorders less appealing (perhaps by discussing the negative consequences), yet I understand that at the time the book was written the author was fighting her own battles. Thus, I reccommend this book with caution-it might be better to read if you have resolved to recover or if you are a bit older...at the age of 19 anorexia not seem so appealing anymore."
5,A deeply touching journey through anorexia nervosa,"Though only 14, Leslie Hiller is dying. Only she is behind her demise. This harrowing tale of Leslie's journey through anorexia nervosa is so thourough and touching that it must be called one of those rare treasures that are read over and over and cherished forever. This book takes the reader through Leslie's mind and her experiences and the ending will bring tears as Leslie finds a will to live after so many months of pain. A deeply moving story that should be read by anyone whose family has been touched by this disease"
2,TOO MANY TRICKS REVEALED,"As with Stick Figure, this book provides too many accounts of ways to fool parents, friends and doctors. While it is realistic, if you are not committed to recovery it can trigger ED thoughts and habits. When someone is in the depth of their ED, the horrible consequences of an ED explored in this book will be ignored while the message justifying an ED will be remembered and imitated."
4,Worthwhile,"This book was a slow starter for me. I initially read the first 3 chapters, put the book down and neglected it for nearly 9 months. I picked it back up one day to find out that once you reach chapter 4, the book really does take off and turn out to be a compelling read. It is beautifully written and is one of the few books that I feel is capable of giving some insight to a non-sufferer of ED's, but like I said, the beginning kind of drags on."
4,Sexy Bad-Boy Cowboy with a Huge chip on his shoulder,"Back of the book synopsis:TONGUES ARE WAGGING!Bubba Gibson's little princess is back in town--all grown up, and her marriage in tatters. Not so high-and-mighty now, they're saying. Imagine Sara Gibson scrubbing rooms at a local motel! And after twenty-odd years, Mr. Chip-on-his-shoulder, Warren Trent, has the nerve to show his face again.He's up to no good at the old Swanson barn, for sure. Whatever can Sara be thinking of, hanging around the man all of Crystal Creek loves to hate?"
4,Love Love Love,It's absolutely perfect in every way. I bought 3 sets because I loved it so much. Simple yet stylish.
2,Not So Pleased,"I do like the pattern, but there are rough bits of steel at the ends of some pieces. Disappointing enough to have me return them."
1,Rubbish,What they do in the name of fusion? I bought this CD because I like Zakir Husain in the planet drums.She uses all big names in vain. She is just a pretty face and should go into modelling
3,"Good Football, Terrible Quality","I got this football for christmas and I really liked it. It it easy to punt and throw. The main drawback is you need big hands to throw it far.The quality is unimpressive. After 2 months, the bottom began tearing and it was impossible to throw.This is like a high school football. It's design is really good, and it spirals better than any football I've ever used. Distance is hard though, the laces are pretty tight and getting a good grip is hard at times. Unlike most footballs, this is easy to throw in the rain or snow."
1,Awful!!!,"What a disappointment! Actually, the CD is appalling!!!! This is the kind of music you hear in southern Spain, not Italy. I travel to Europe 4 or 5 times a year & usually to Italy or Spain. Music is my thing - & I plan my trips around musical performances. I have never heard music like that on your CD in Italy in the 40+ years I've traveled there. Makes me de-value Rough Guides in general...."
4,"Finally, a video with acceptable volume of Chinese","I wanted my kids to truly learn Chinese, not a word here and there, which is apparently the case with Kailan, Walker and Ping Ping, and Culture Cubs (although these are cute). Little Pim actually teaches about 30-50 words per DVD. I gave it four stars, because the intonation was off on a couple of words."
2,disappointed,"I am disappointed with this dvd set. I wish they would have included video of someone pronouncing the words as well. Seeing someone say the words is also important, and, no, an animated panda does not count. Maybe this is less important for older kids, but then don't say the dvd is appropriate for babies as well. I can still use the dvd's for all the positive reasons other reviewers have given, but this seems to me to be a major downside."
4,Amazing,"If you enjoy novels that are completely historical but interweave a story, this is an awesome book. Isabel Allende researched for 4 years about Ines and Pedro de Valdivia and uses her imagination when history fails her. Although written in the context of a woman and her part in the conquest of Chile, there are battles and soldiers and warrior indians too. Great book!"
3,Will we ever overcome our violent nature?,"It is an interesting time to read this book since Chile has been in thenews due to Pinochet's death and the accounts of the killings and torturethat occurred while he was in power. Also interesting,of course,is IsabelAllende's relationship to Salvador Allende and her current comments aboutAugusto Pinochet.I am a long time fan of Isabel Allende's works, but this is not one ofmy favorites. I did not feel as drawn into the characters and story as Iusually am. I did not feel the delight in her language and vibrancy. Yet,the adventures, loves, and events in the life of Ines Suarez werefascinating and deserved to be told. The story of the founding of Chiledrew me away into another world.The book also added some perspective to our current extremely violentworld. Killing and torture has been going on for so many years, it isnothing new, and shows no signs of stopping."
2,Ines of My Soul (not Allende's best work),"When I received this book as a gift, I was so happy and grateful. I have read many of Isabel Allende's books from House of Spirits, Daughter of Fortune, Tales of Eva Luna and others. I couldn't wait to start reading this one. I was so disappointed. Perhaps because Allende was trying to stay true to this historical character rather than letting her imagination take her where it wanted to go. This book is just plain boring. I'm sorry to say it about one of my favorite author's work. I wish her editors would have been honest with her and stated the truth. I read half way through the book hoping for it to get interesting. But it never did. I finally had to abandon it and picked up another book to read instead. Will it put me off reading Allende? Definitely not. She's done it so many times before, she can do it again. Besides, she's entitled to a dud or two. And who knows. Maybe it was just me. Others, evidenced by the other comments posted, loved this book."
2,Sad to Say,"Sad to say this is not our usual Allende. The subject is fraught with violence and inhumanity. These are not admirable people. Their motives and actions reek of shallowness, self-serving, and ubridled egotism. Ines is a remarkable woman, but she canot be divorced from her time and place.Allende's narrative skill and characterzation are not up to par.I will still look forward to her next book."
2,Extremely disappointing,"Having read most of Allende's works, I found 'Inez of My Soul' very disppointing. Her characters were not to be embraced; flat and not endearing and/or people you can hate. Ines takes off from Spain in search of her husband... (remember her character in Daughter of Fortune?) sounds familiar to me. Ines becomes the main backbone of the settlers while searching for Chilean settlements.. nurse/doctor, provider of food/crops, wise and compassionate yet turns a blind eye to suffering of the Indians. What do you think the reference to 9/11 was all about? My book club LOVED Dauther of Fortune and Portrait in Sepia, but I certainly will NOT recommend this book. I felt she recreated too many instances from Daughter of Fortune. The book is tedious and violent beyond necessity."
2,Blah,"Inés of My Soul is blandly written (or translated? or both? I'm not sure), and its plot extremely contrived. I enjoyed the history lesson, but that's not what you want your novel to feel like. And it suffers from that really obnoxious phenomenon where historical novels focus on ideas and details specifically of interest to and which reflect the values of the modern reader. Bleh."
2,Magical Realism or Tiresome Bodice-Ripper?,"Anyone who has enjoyed the beautifully written Eleanor of Aquitaine by Historian Alison Weir will find this a painful and tiresome read. There are details that ring false, and after awhile it was hard to stay interested. After trudging through the Chilean deserts, almost dying of thirst, the troop still has wine to give their wounded warriors? In the springtime, she reports they at last have fruit to eat--what fruits ripen in the spring? An entire battalion of soldiers disguises themselves in sheets--where would there be that many precious and costly sheets in the 16th century? I suppose all of this can be attributed to poetic license or ""magical realism"" but it just rings false and silly. Perhaps teenage girls will enjoy it as a spicy fairy story."
3,have like others by allende better,"I am a big fan of isabel allende; and have read many of her books, but this one was a little too dense with history and seemed repetitive to me. My husband on the other hand, who likes non-fiction, biographies, and historical novels, found this excellent and he enjoyed more than me."
4,No need for Faux Spanish Accent,"This is another excellent Isabel Allende book. I enjoyed Ines' story and learning more about the early days of conquistadores in South America. My only quibble with the book has to do with the narration. Blair Brown is a fine actress and I have enjoyed her other audio books. Here she uses a faux Spanish accent and it doesn't work! She mispronounces the words ""empanadas"" and ""governador"" over and over again, along with other words. I cringed every time and it distracted me from the storytelling. (I can't believe the Publisher's Weekly review says her accent is spot-on. I wonder if the person reviewing the audio book even speaks Spanish!)I think the listener would be better off hearing Ms. Brown use her ""normal"" accent or have the producers' employ someone with a legitimate Spanish accent."
3,Woman Warrior?,"I like the poetic flow of Allende's prose,although in this instance, because of the type of novel that it is of war, killing and conquest, there was not the usual poetry type prose. However, I was spellbound through the entire story and would recommend this book to everyone. As far as the authenticity of the historical facts, as some reviewers felt, I read the book for its entertainment and not for its historical correctness."
2,Not her best.,"I was so excited to purchase and read this new book by Allende, that I may have put my expectations too high. Unlike Daughter of Fortune's Eliza, Ines lacks grace and integrety. Towards the middle of the novel, I had started to skip pages because I could guess what she was going to say and do. Her, ""I am a 16th century woman, hear me roar"" routine got very old after the first few chapters and I wanted something more from her. Humility? Softness? I'm not sure, but what I do know is that with the rich historical tapestry that Allende has proven she can weave, I am disapointed that she didn't try harder in convincing us that Ines was a flesh and blood woman and not just some Amazonian slayer of Mapuche. Ines is too proud, too sure of herself. I regret not being introduced to this historical figure properly."
3,Unnecessarily brutal and descriptive,While this was a good story I found it to be unnecessarily brutal and disturbing. It also lacked the spirituality of Ms. Allende's best books and left me with a bad taste.
2,Ines of My Sout,"This book is difficult to read. I want a story but the history is foreign and gets in the way. That is not Allende's fault. I need to know more about the setting, the history in order to understand it. She writes well, but this does not rank among the best."
3,Not as great as I had expected,"I desperately wanted to like this book but just could not get into it. It took me months to read, which is quite unusual for me. I kept thinking that it would be worth it in the end, but it really wasn't. The writing was just very dry and not too exciting."
2,Ines of my soul.,"This is one of the inferior novels that I have read of Isabel Allende. I could not finish it to the end. The protagonist is a strong female character set on an arduous journey with conquistadors and natives,from Peru to Chile. The part of coursing that distance was tedious reading which had to be skimmed."
3,Cheap Filter,"We all know Fram makes economy (crap) filters with cardboard filter ends etc. However, with purolator, I thought It would be different, turns out, This is pretty much a rebranded fram fuel filter. The ends are plastic which has the habit of cracking and deforming, not to mention being in contact with gasoline!I returned it immediatelyGo with All metal fuel filters from Bosch, Wix, or Napa Gold"
2,WAY too much money...,"...for an brief, inaccurate, and at best an only average book which offers nothing new on the great but tragic actor, Montgomery Clift. Most of it is in fact a collection of annotations from well over 100 different sources - biographies, news clippings, etc.At 150 pages (not including the footnote references or appendixes, which are at least informative), this book was overpriced and underwritten."
1,de capua biography of Montgomery Clift,This bio is a total waste of money and it is the 2nd most expensive among the biographies written. Mr. De Capua is an uninspired writer with a dull writing style whodoes not give the reader any information not previously found in other bios of Mr. Clift. Patricia Bosworth and Robert La Guardia have done much better with captivating writing styles and pertinent information. i have read all the books about Monty and only Maurice Leonard surpasses Mr. De Capua's disappointing treatment of this great actor.
3,Awesome story,"The book came with a yard sale price sticker on it and the inside had initials of who owed it and on the back inside cover there was a library slip. none of this was mentioned in the description from seller. This book was for my own child so it wasn't a present that needed to be presnetable. My child loves the story, not as much as I did when I was a child though. He loves Elmer's voice. the book did come before Christmas, It did ship quicker than was stated."
2,Written to about a 3rd Grade reading level,"This book is fine if you like being 'spoken' to in a 3rd grade manner. Mr. Tribbe could have done so much more with this concept, but instead attempts to sermonize, and the more sermonizing he does the more theologically shaky ground he gets on. Had he stuck to what is known about Jesus' words instead of trying to paraphrase Jesus or worse, twist the intent of Jesus' words, the book would have been more enjoyable and maybe more believable.There certainly is a lot of jibberish out there, and unfortunately I would heap this book amongst the others."
1,Completely Defective,"The CD worked fine when I first got it. I played it about 5 times and then it just clicked off after about 1 minute. I tried different CDs, read the instructions through, and it just doesn't work! Since I threw away the packaging and receipt as soon as I got it, I can't apply for a refund or return it so I really lost out here. I definitely would warn you not to buy this item. Or at least keep your receipt and the packaging so you can send it back if it quits after six playings like mine did. I also will probably not buy anything else by Coby unless I can get a guarantee of return/refund if it doesn't work."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this CD Player in both the yellow and the blue for my daughters, and both are a piece of junk. Oh, they work o.k. if you are sitting still and holding the jack for the ear phone in just the right spot. But I have borrowed both of them for my evening walks and they suck. Any movement at all make the CD skip. I don't know about most people but if I'm sitting at home I play my CD on my stereoor computer. It's when I'm out walking or shopping that I use a discman. The only upside to this is that if the kids break or lose them it won't be any big loss for the price or quality."
1,piece of junk,defective right out of the box. It never happened to me before when I ordered from Amazon. REturning.
4,good product,"this is a good product for the money. it skips sometimes - when bumped, etc, but its a great buy, i'm glad i got it."
4,coby cd player,"once I got one that worked, its great. thanks to Amazon for the great way they handled the problem."
5,These are the right price and the seller got it to me pretty fast,"Some knitters really like the clover bamboo circular needles. Sometimes I do to. However, bamboo 16"" needles do not need to cost that much! So, good ole' Boye has these aluminum needles. They are the right price in this economy, have a range of sizes and let the yarn, be it acrylic or wool, slide on the needles. The points are more angular than the more blunted bamboo. The joints are tapered. Bamboo can have a tendency to ""stick"", some people like that. What ever, the case. These are good go to needles if you are trying to build up your needle stash, or like to knit more than one hat at a time and are a penny pincher like me. If your plastic loop doesn't want to bend, heat it a little with your hair dryer to be more workable. Have fun!"
1,Horrible,Dont waste time on these needles. They are horrible - the tacky plastic cord tangles up and they are useless.Spend the extra few $$ on a decent set of bamboo needles with a wire cord.
3,Cable kinks up!,"While the needles themselves are fantastic, the cable between them is fairly awful. I tried knitting a hat with these three times, and each time the cable kinked up and my hat was more like a Mobius strip. Next time I think I'm going to splurge for needles with a better cord."
1,Cable is awful,"I bought these needles from a craft store and I was so disappointed when I realized that I could not use them. The cable gets twisted and kinks up in the way of your work; it is so stiff that you will have trouble to push it away. I wanted to knit some socks and it's impossible to use these needles for such a small project. Maybe I can use them to knit a hat, but not sure. In any case, I will have to go get myself some better quality needles to finish my project...(I heard Addi Turbo and Knit Picks circular needles are the best)."
4,Question:,"Last time I checked this box set had 3 CDs with about 10-15 tracks each as opposed to this set of like 6 songs per disc, what happened?If you know the answer please email me at admills@ucsc.edu, thanks."
5,always: the only band that matters,"most people know the clash from such songs like 'rock the casbah', 'should i stay or should i go', 'train in vain'...etc. this is a MUST HAVE COLLECTION for fans of the clash. even if you only like their more popular songs! there is no way you will be disappointed. it has all their ""hits"" and some of the less heard-but superb-songs like 'straight to hell', 'guns of brixton', and so so so much more. i adore the clash and this box set is so terrific. you can just put in all 3 discs and enjoy each and every song, from the london calling days to combat rock! A++.two thumbs up."
3,A selection of writings from Price's books,"not much too say about this.. you will either be familiar with the material if you've bought anything before written by Alfred Price...or you won't..Much better to go back to the works from which these are extracted. There are extracts from all of Price's works as far as I can tell, Vietnam, the Falklands, the Fw 190, one or two new pieces and a new overview on how air combat may develop over the decades to come..As ever the writing is precise and skilful...but the book itself a bit of a pointless exercise.."
3,"Fun, but has started to peel","It looks great in my son's shark-themes bedroom, but after it being up for only 3 months, it has started to peel from the wall."
3,"Very captivating, very interesting, very confusing","This book is a great concept and very interesting but at times, very confusing. There were no explanations for different people mentioned in the book (even after reading the book from cover to cover I still am confused about a couple of names mentioned). Also, there is a lot of ""lingo"" used that if you were never in the Army or closely related you would have no idea. A lot of abbreviations were used with no explanations (I have no idea what a O.D. uniform is). Like I said at the beginning -- this concept was great, the letters were great, the book was put together without any history about the nurse, her family, friends, and no explanation on lingo or abbreviations. I am done reading this book and cannot really connect with the people or things because I have no idea what they are talking about. Frustrating!!"
2,I HATE THESE TRIBUTE CD'S,"ok so U guys have to admit...if these guys made songs of their own and were a band of their own they won't be that bad....Imagine them makin a band of their own...they really won't be that bad...that's why I gave 2 stars instead of 1....but NOBODY CAN REPLACE THE REAL MUDVAYNE, and mudvayne is one of my favorite bands....doin a one cover song is okay...but omg they sound nothing like mudvayne and they just kill the songs....as far as tryin to sound like mudvayne goes this band sux but they DO have the talent to make their own stuff tho....and they don't put LD50 songs on here either (one guy said that earlier but I agree with him tho) so yea this CD is just pure crap....this band should make an album of their own tho...they really should"
1,ew,"not even worth half of a star, being a huge fan of mudvayne i was like eh, lets listen to this, my ears have been soiled, terrible singing, you cant recreate a band as great as mudvayne spend your money on something better AN ACTUAL MUDVAYNE CD"
1,Just buy the Real thing,"Why would anyone listen to and much less pay for an album that mimics the original work of an obviously more talented artist. I wouldn't by artwork from Frank Piccasso, a no talented artist who decided to paint a second rate ""tribute painting"". Its bad enough cover bands are infecting nightclubs, lets not let them make albums. Just leave this cd's webpage and walk away..slowly."
2,Broken in 2 years,"I used this occasionally, less than once a month, and today the handle snapped off when I was draining spinach. I though this would last a long time, but was fooled by the appearance. Would not buy again."
5,Misting fountain,so far I am quite pleased with this fountain. Its been in use for several hours per day now for 3 weeks. I wanted something for a visual effect that would also disperse nice aromas of essential oils and could use tap water. The water level goes down 3/4 of an inch after running 8 hours which is not bad since it creates a nice cloud of fog swirling around changing colors of light with a nice background noise of trickling water. I hope it is durable because I plan to run it everyday in my office.
4,Nice Game,"If you are a character tweaking freak, this is the game for you. There are so many different things you can do with the 6 party members you create. There are somewhere around 10 different races and classes to choose from. You can even change your characters to different classes in the middle of the game if you have the proper stats. This game definately lives up to the Wizardry name. Character development is the best part of Wizardy 8. All of the other aspects such as graphics, sound etc. are so-so. It is difinately a fun game to play and will keep you entertained for hours."
1,"Someday, somehow, we're gonna quit but not right now","could someone tell Chad Kroger that the ""sad puppy dog eye look"" died out about 10 years ago?Go buy a little cd called SUPERUNKOWN by a little band called SOUNDGARDEN to hear this type of sound how it was MADE to sound"
4,Really good buy-highly recommend to rock fans,"Nickelback seems to step it up just a bit with THE LONG ROAD. This CD displays some good hard rock sounds. Remains true with Nickelback's previous releases, and rolls out the future hits."
2,"Okay, but repeating and boring, buy the first one instead!","This is an okay cd, but it is somewhat boring, and repeats itself, if u want a good nickleback cd, buy there first one or buy linkinpark or something, dont waste ur money."
3,"Good, Great, and Bland","There are some good songs here, some amazing ones, and a handful that are simply as uninspired sounding as rock songs can manage to be. You'll want to own it for the wonderful rockers that this album contains. But brace yourself for the times you'll want to skip certain tracks."
4,My Favorite Rock CD in quite awhile,"Nickelback is simple. Their guitar riffs are extremely easy to play and follow, and their lyrics have nothing complicated about them whatsoever. I thought about that for awhile, and then relized exactly why I like this CD so much...its raw. Basic emotions and lifes problems are the basis for most of the songs here, and with the music loud and the distorted electric doing that signiture Nickelback 'chug-chug-chug' most of the time, you just can't help but love it. The choruses are catchy and fun to sing (scream) along with, so if you're looking for a very solid, rock CD that you can listen to over and over.. this is the best I've found in a long time. I couldn't bring myself to give it five stars simply because the pure talent isn't there to compete with my other five star ratings, but don't let that deter you... its well worth the purchase."
3,Indecisive................,"I really don't know what to say about Nickleback. If you're into super heavy rock like me(80's Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament,etc), they're not for you. If you like classic punk(Bad Brains, The Clash, etc), there not for you. If you like early 90's grunge(Nirvana, Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam), there not for you. Or if nu-metal's your thing(Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit), look elsewhere. The problem is that their sound doesn't stand out in the rock world; Creed, Puddle Of Mudd, Godsmack , Staind and others are pretty much doing the exact same thing. But the bands I just mentioned do put out solid material, and so does Nickleback. Silver Side Up is better than this,but not by much. Before the album came out, the band said that this album would be a hybrid of Metallica and Pantera,which would essentally make it one of the heaviest albums ever. Though I laughed my head off at the statement, I bought the album anyway. Only get it if you're a hardcore fan."
3,Not their best but it's okay,This CD does not measure up to some of their other CDs but it is a step better than their earliest CDs.
4,Good beginning,I bought the 3 latest cd's before I got this one. It's a good example of their early stuff and a really good sound. For me it was an excelent prequel to music I had already come to like. If you don't already have this cd in your collection it is worth getting.
5,What can you say...,"The best of Nickelback's albums. The power of the vocals, the strength of the lyrics, the honesty of their music is amazing."
1,"Man, i want my nickel back","This is pointless generic radio rock. If you like Chemical Romance, Simple Plan, Fallout Boy and other MTV crapola, then you'll probably enjoy playing air guitar along to this.Pick up some good stuff like...Korn(old stuff), Breaking Benjamin, Green Day(Warning and before), Smile Empty Soul, Lostprophets, Aerosmith, Exies, Papa Roach, Disturbed, Blindside... need i go on?"
1,Pile,"This is in response to the reviewer who compaired this cd to Metallica's Black Album. Compairing these two cds is about like comparing a Kia Sedan to a Ferrai. What are you thinking, you idiot?"
3,Okay Not as good as Silver side up or The State though,Someday Feelin' Way Too Damn Good and Beacuse of you are the only good songs on the albulm if you like nickleback then Buy The State Or silver side up Instead.
5,Best CD Ever,"I think that this is the best CD I've ever heard. I really like Nickelback, this is their best CD yet, and I've heard all of them, trust me. Don't listen to those people who say that Nickelback sucks or their songs all sound the same, because it isn't true. Don't wait, buy this CD now! You won't regret it at all!"
2,More of the same,"Other than better production, this disc is too similar to the band's previous output. Like Puddle of Mudd, Linkin Park, and a dozen other bands, Nickelback talks the talk but keeps repeating the same old steps when they walk the walk. For those who think this is great music, I'm glad you found something to indentify with, but don't get stuck wallowing in the angst."
5,LOVE,"what can I say, I LOVE nickelback! so naturally I love this album. thank you amazon for the 5 dollar downloads each month!"
1,Uninspired,"I like the pants around your knees? You're my favorite disease?These are stunningly and embarassingly bad lyrics. Trouble is, they are better than the music. :+0"
3,Good follow-up to Silver-side up,"""Silver-Side Up"" is a stronger album overall, but ""The Long Road"" has some really great moments. It is a worthy follow-up and will most likely please the fans. I hope that the band continues to make good music, and someday comes out with a truly great album. They are certainly capable."
1,The Long Road to Lameville,This type of music represents everything that is soul-less and wrong about Rock music today. Do not buy this corporate spineless schlock.
2,very disapointing album,"i didnt realy like this album. i really liked ""silver side up"" better than this one. it is totally not worth the money."
1,Argh.,Nickelback essentially sum up everything that is wrong with the music industry today. What else can I say? This stuff is so bad it makes me go cross-eyed.
4,Cool CD...,"Great CD, just loved it, can't wait for more from Nickelback. And Mike, what is wrong with other people liking Nickelback? Just because you don't like it doesn't mean that we all have to go out and buy CD's from ""Flaming Lips"" and ""Mercury Rev."" I definitely won't need to deny hearing them because I have never heard OF them, and anyway, I WOULDN'T want to listen to a bunch of drugged-up losers. You really need to get some looser panties and a puzzle. New panties because they are obviously cutting off circulation to your brain, and a puzzle to give you something else to do besides harass people. Feel better now?"
4,Gimme My Nickle Back!,"Just Kidding. This CD started off on the wrong foot for me, because I didn't (and still don't) really like the first song. It seemed really messy to me. I couldn't get into the second song, until later listening. However, when Someday hit, I was hooked from there on. Every song after is great rock and, for the most part, interesting lyrically. So, if you were a fan last time, drop a dime for Nickleback."
4,Status Quo,"""Long Road"" is typical Nickelback - but that's good. There are only a few tracks which I would consider ""filler"". Otherwise, the mix of slow and upbeat tunes on the track is well balanced. And the lyrics are truly creative. As expected, I'm not disappointed with the disc."
1,"Pathetic, Unoriginal and a little Offensive","Those are the words to describe Nickleback's latest album. They relied on the same formulas for this abortion. There is nothing new here. Same old songs, some old riffs. These guys have absolutly no artisic integrity. Their lates single is offensive and shouldn't be allowed to be played on the radio. It's disgusting and less than subtle. Chad Krouger, please retire, you're not welcome here."
1,Their harmony is like fingernails on a chalkboard.,"Personal preference is everything in music. Nickelback's performances all sound the same to me. Their harmony is grating to my ears. It reminds me of cats fighting. If you like their music then please disregard my comment. If you aren't familiar with their music, tread carefully before purchasing."
2,Poorly Recorded,This CD and the other Nickelback CD's I've bought are heavily compressed. I've been looking at the waveforms and there is a TON of clipping also. I'm very disappointed. I want my money back.
2,Worst Nickelback Album.,"I was pretty excited to get this after having ""Silver Side Up"". I was very disappointed. If it hadn't been for ""Feelin' Way Too Damn Good"" and ""Figured You Out"", I would have given this one star. Thankfully, with their last two albums ""All The Right Reasons"" and ""Dark Horse"" they returned to ""Silver Side Up"" form."
3,"NOT Bad,could be better","Nickelback are one of those bands,you like one day and you hate the other. This cd isn't that bad at all.I think the best track is ""you figuared me out"".All the other track are so/so tracks even the singles so far.this is alt rock music that is mixed in with southern rockish sound,with good guitar.IF you liked Silver Side Up, you will like this cd. I only buy if you are worthy fan,or into nickelback songs. but you can live without this cd,and if anything go out a buy some FUEL cd's."
3,Middle of the road,"Whereas it's better than the previous effort, Silver Side Up, it still lacks the ability to keep you hook from start to finish, too long? maybe, not enough really good songs, also maybe, it's ok but not brilliant, but i may be wrong and you can give it a listen because i still think it's good just might take a while to get used to..."
1,Despicable,"Alright Nickelback fans, please, Im begging you. Before you buy this album, before you give a four or five star review or before you automatically click the ""no"" button at the bottom of this review, do something for me. If you happen to have 2 cd players handy, listen to ""Someday"" and ""How You Remind Me"" at the same time. Beat for beat, line for line, they are the EXACT same song. These guys have absolutely no originality; from the start theyve been ripping off grunge bands such as Pearl Jam and Days Of The New. And now theyre just writing the same songs over and over to sell to the naive, impressionable people who buy this junk and dont realize that Nickelback are only in it for the money. Stop supporting this band and all of its sound alikes."
1,Long road back to the toilet,"Nickelback has to be one of the worst bands of today. No, I'm not talking about talent, they can obviously play repetitive annoying 3-chord riffs over and over till you feel like committing suicide. If you plan on killing yourself for listening to this corporate garbage, barring that you don't go deaf first, I don't blame you. There is no melodic value to this whatsoever. It is sad that Nickelback is a success in the music industry along with other weak bands like Saliva (Josie Scott is the ugliest elephant I've ever seen). They're both pseudo-country. No wonder why the only people who like these bands seem to be the ones who are looking to ""rebel"" their parents' preferred tastes of country. Go get 'em cowboy...yee haw. I think Earnhardt Jr. is waiting outside."
4,Very Nice,"This music is real. Nickelback sings about things that most people try to keep in the back of their closets. It's real without being unnecessarily explicit. It packs enough punch to make you sit up and pay attention to the lyrics, yet doesn't scare the living daylights out of you. Very good, good to play through once in a while. If you really like Nickelback, buy this CD. If you aren't sure, borrow it from someone... and play the entire CD through. Once around will be enough to tell you if you like it or not."
4,A Good Solid Release,"Rock is simply not it's best these days. However, among the few who are always good on their follow up albums, Nickelback has released yet another successful, rockout cd. If you are a fan of Nickelback, this is perfect for you, and if not, this is still a good release. It's not Silver Side Up, or The State, but it is perfect for your collection."
1,ew.,how is it that these creed-clones are able to make a sophomore album?!the music is boring and clichee. kroeger is an egotistical ass not worthy of your money.what a waste of plastic
2,B-o-r-i-n-g,"This is the worst of modern rock. Its boring, uninspired, has no style or memorable songs, and its just... blah. It doesnt help any that ""Someday"" has been played on the radio 24/7 for the past 2 or 3 months. Another thing, what makes these guys any different from Creed? At least Creed had an interesting frontman with a big ego, these Nickelback guys dont have anything that sets them apart from other bands. If you want interesting modern rock bands check out Linkin Park, Blink-182, Good Charlotte or Limp Bizkit."
1,Making the Beast with Two Nickelbacks,"If I had two nickels to rub together, I'd probably use them to buy something. I dunno what, maybe a piece of bubblegum or something. What else can you buy with two nickels? Time was when you could buy a cup of coffee with that kind of money. But that was before my time. It is for these reasons alone that I can't give a rave review to this album, even if I wanted to, which I don't, but wouldn't nonetheless, unless my life depended on it, for instance, if the record producer was holding a gun to my head and I truly believed he was going to pull the trigger if I didn't give a rave review, my sense of self-preservation would supersede my fine critical acumen and against all the musical instincts I possess I would then have to give it a rave review under duress and therefore it would not be legally enforceable as an accurate testimony regarding what I would consider its true worth. Does anyone have a licorice whip I can chew on?"
2,Long Road? Sounds like somebody took the short road!,"Nickelback's The Long Road, the follow up to their previous hit album Silver Side Up, sounds as if it came to soon. The Long Road does have its highlights with the radio staples ""Someday"" and the raunchy Figured YOu Out,but when it comes to the rest of the album there's nothing there. Most of The Long Road sounds like their using the same song over and over, most of the performances are unispired and dual. A major disappointment when compared to Silver Side Up."
4,Nickelback's Best Yet,"I don't care what anyone else has to say about this album because it is the most solid effort yet from the band. You won't hit the skip button too much, which is the mark of a good CD. Nickelback gives you what you liked in Silver Side Up(crisp guitar riffs, catchy coruses, social commentary, angst, etc.) and then some. This is solid hard rock in the vein of 3 Doors Down, Saliva and Ra, not harsh rock(i.e. Korn, System of a Down, etc.) Standout songs include Believe it or Not, Throw Yourself Away(with a disturbing topic ripped from recent headlines) and the first single Someday. If you're a fan of hard rock then The Long Road is well worth owning."
4,Good rock album from Nickelback,"RATING: 4/6This is a great rock album, more good songs than bad songs, but overall they're all ok/good songs. I'll write a rating for each song,01. Flat on the Floor (GOOD SONG 5/5)02. Do This Anymore (BAD SONG 2/5)03. Someday (GOOD SONG 5/5)04. Believe It or Not (BAD SONG 3/5)05. Feelin' Way Too Damn Good (GOOD SONG 5/5)06. Because of You (GOOD SONG 4/5)07. Figured You Out (GOOD SONG 5/5)08. Should've Listened (BAD SONG 3/5)09. Throw Yourself Away (GOOD SONG 5/5)10. Another Hole in the Head (GOOD 4/5)11. See You at the Show (GOOD SONG 4.5/5)12. Saturday Night's Alright (GOOD SONG 5/5)13. Learn the Hard Way (GOOD SONG 5/5)14. Yanking Out My Heart (BAD SONG 3.5/5)The few stand out songs would be ""Figured You Out"", ""Saturday Night's Alright"", ""Throw Yourself Away"", ""Someday"", ""Flat on the Floor"", and ""See You at the Show"". If you're a fan of rock music with a great quality sound, you'll enjoy this album."
4,"OK, let's write a meaningful review for a meaningful album","First of all, I want to go on the record as saying that I enjoyed Long Road better than Silver Side Up. I love both albums, but Long Road seemed like a more mature CD than the previous ones. I was very impressed with what I heard. I think that if you liked Silver Side Up you'll also really appreciate the band's new attempts in Long Road. The songs are much more clear but stick to the grunge roots of their nature. I can't wait to see what else they come up with, I know I'll be impressed."
2,A few good songs BUT,"After reading so many reviewers saying that The Long Road is the best CD by Nickelback yet, I was slightly disappointed when I got it home. Too many of the songs sound the same. Actually, I think the best song on the album is their ""cover"" of Elton John's Saturday Nights Alright (for fighting). Now that song rocks!And I must agree with the reviewer that said the packaging sucks. It does. Who the hell wants packaging like that?So in my opinion, Silver Side Up is still (by far) Nickelback's best album. The Long Road and The State are OK albums but, song for song, they just can't compare to Silver Side Up.But HEY... if you haven't checked out the DVD of Nickelback in concert, THAT is what you need to get. It is absolutely first rate. The filming, the playing the song selection... everything is just stellar. (There is some cursing on it but who the f#@k cares!) So if you like Nickelback, buy that next.FrancoPennsylvania"
1,waste of money,"The State was great, Silver side up was good..........and this is crap.The cd sucks and they didn't even put the real version of 'saturdays alright for fighting with kid rock.If they cared about there fans, they would have put that version.Plus they are a smart band, they re-wrote how you remind me and they are selling like crazy.This album dosen't have anything good about it.All the songs sound the same.Who ever said this album was like Metallica's black album is a pure moron.Buddy, don't be dissin Metallica.Hey Nickelback, I want my nickel'c back.This cd sucks."
1,Wake me when it's done,"One word sums this album up -BORING!!!! , the same repetitve power chords , dull vocals , and strained lyrics which is to say typical Nickelback , anyway it is not NOT worth the price so if you like this music wait till this album goes into the bargin bin . If you want real Hard Rock/meatal go treat yourself to an AC/DC , Guns N Roses or Iron Maiden album !"
1,Do us a favor and get lost on that long road!,"Ugh.Thats the first reaction I get every time I hear these talentless posers on the radio. The singers voice just irritates me beyond explaination and the band can't play. Did you know these guys are signed to Roadrunner records? The same label that has kick ass bands like Slipknot, Murderdolls, and Stone Sour? Sorry, but these fairies just don't fit in with those guys. I just wish all their loser fans would wake up and realize how much Nickleback suuuuuucks.DustinX over and out!"
2,Not pleased...,"I cant help but think Nickelback is losing their edge. The State rocked, silver side up was ok and now The Long Road, apart from a couple of songs, just blows. Sorry if anyone really liked this album (and I'm sure many did) but I cant find anything new or special about it. It sounds like silver side up but worse. Disappointed..."
1,"trash, just trash","Thinking this would be like there last album....I was wrong.Not only is this album pure trash, they didn't even put the good version of 'Saturdays alright for fighting' with Kid Rock.So I just took a nice dump.....and along with that dump, is this cd."
1,Staleback's next sleeper,"After surviving through the nauseating airplay of How You Remind Me and Hero, I was hesitant to listen to anything new from Nickelback. Being a fan of their first album The State, I gave their newest release the benefit of the doubt. Unsuprisingly the bulk of the album tries to cash in on the popular sound of How You Remind Me and comes off as another stale compilation of the same guitars, song structure and boring lyrics. If you're looking for something fresh try Seether or Shinedown. But if you still can't get enough of How You Remind Me, then here's at least 5 songs that sound exactly like it."
4,Nickelback's latest endeavour is a success,"'The Long Road' is a great 4th album release by this soft rock Canadian group. Nickelback will be around for a long time to come with plenty more songs and album releases to come. The magical chemistry that is lost on many bands can be found with this band. My all time favourite song from Nickelback is 'Someday', a deep heart-felt beat with beautiful lyrics and a memorising video-clip that goes along with it.For any fans of Nickelback, you won't be disappointed at all."
2,Melody Needed !!!,"Nickelback is just an above average band.. i know , many would disagree.. but its true. Some of their songs r very good ..but just some ! many songs have the same sound !! I have to say tht Nickelback Needs Melody in their music !! There r no moving ballads and no excellent acoustic numbers at all in all their albums ! i wonder why ? The only great point abt Nickelback is...without any doubt .. Chad Kroeger !! hes a fantastic singer with a great range and a captivating voice !! He shud better go solo !! Nickelback fans plz dont mind... but this is true..they r not making good music despite 3 albums or so !!If u want to hear some great music .. Listen to the band REVIS !! and they will make u forget nickelback (ofcourse not chad )!! Give a try to REVIS !!!"
1,borinig!!!!!!!!,"i would say nickelback always repeat themselves thats really boring!!!!!!!they will come demise!!!!!!everysong is nearly the SAME!so if u want to listen to this album,take your time ,just pick one is enough.if u keep listen,u will get sick"
1,*sigh*,Musically homogenous. Lyrically homogenous. Or just plain stupid. Nickelback isn't gritty; they're more like gruel. Need I say more? I won't because I am lazy and thinking about Nickelback is disrupting my peace of mind.
1,awful,"this isnt a good album. their last one was mediocre but this one is worse, there are 2 songs here that stand out, which are the singles, the rest form a blur of alt heavy rock. if you like this, then this album will float your boat, if youre a real music fan you will probly hate it."
1,Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!,"i am not trying to be a Nikelback hater I am a Nikelback hater and for those that want to join me make this review helpful for you and make use for it because Nikelback sucks......you want some good modern rock music get Audioslave,Metallica,Tool,Opeth,Red Hot Chili Peppers.....hell even Prince is better than this crap Nikelback is backed up by frequent radio plays thats it without radio nikelback is dead and i think they know that thats prob why they pay the radio to play their weak talentless songs 20 million times untill you want to throw your stereo outdie and window put gasoline on it and torch it to death only realizing that you wasted a completely good stereo because of NikelCrack"
1,Generic radio trash.,"Nickelback is a cancerous tumor in today's music industry, simple as that. I don't know how they did it, but pretty much every new song you hear on the radio is this dude rock band. God knows what will happen if I hear ""Someday"" or anything with Chad's annoying vocals again. Please don't support these guys any further by buying this."
4,Good Rockin' Music,"I never really cared much for Nickelback from hearing the song ""How You Remind Me"". But I thought I would listen to this album anyway. I'd have to say, it's defently better than alot of rock bands out there today. Worth a spin"
3,A little to commercial to me,"Sounds a bit like Audioslave. A little too Main-Stream for me. I prefer alternate artists like Beck, Royal Trux and Chris Cornell's solo career albums. But hey, it's pretty good stuff. -Just a little too much.Later-Peace"
3,Not as good as the last CD,"This cd is ok, but I prefer Silver Side up to this one. After I bought it, I listened to the whole thing a few times, and could not get into it, except for a couple songs. Better luck next time Nickelback"
5,Their Best,"If you've liked their previous stuff, you'll love this. If you don't know who they are, you should check them out. It's worth the money, no question."
1,Shockingly ignorant,"The data and analysis are outdated and, more importantly, dangerous!I question the value of having this 11 year old book still in print, when we have made leaps and bounds in the search of the cause and cure of HIV/AIDS since then."
5,Hill's Scient Diet Hairball Control Canned Cat Food (Seafood),"I have a one year old cat and a senior cat. The senior cat--a fussy eater with no teeth--was eating another brand of canned cat food, but preferred to ""gum"" dry kibble most of the time. When I bought the Science Diet, she enjoyed it right away and now prefers it exclusively. In retrospect, I believe the other brand may have been upsetting her stomach; she slept all the time, had issues with hairballs and was not interested in play at all. I had attributed this behavior to her age, but since I switched her to the Science Diet she has begun to play again and her coat is extremely soft and shining. The hairballs have stopped entirely. I'm very glad I bought it. (All of that said, the young cat will not touch it.) So you might test it out before buying in quantity. Overall, I'm thrilled with what it has done for my senior cat."
4,right for the price,"Right out of the box this knife is super sharp.It doesn't hold the edge as long as I would like,but for the price it's hard to beat."
2,A dissapointment,"I was unpleasantly surprised after reading the introduction. Not only was it boring and full of unnecessary details, but it abounds in statements like ""Palestinian disaster of 1948"", the ""massacres of the innocent"", ""Zionist agriculture with its efficient sprinklers and ""mortgaged trees"""" (?????!!!!!!!) etc, that are clearly offensive to Israel.Nobody disputes that the history of the Palestinians is full of tragedy and it is bound to influence the poetic mind, but non-substantiated, overtly political statements have no place in a literary anthology. The author clearly lacks professional ethics, letting her bias affect her work. Plus, the poetry was for the most part mediocre, and some Arabic women poets from the Middle East who have friendly ties to Israel are omitted. I admire Arab culture and have Arab ancestry, but this is not the way I wanted to get into the mind of Arabic women. This anthology told me nothing."
4,Nice tool attachment,I got this to add to the poter-cable MS200 stapler to install vinyl siding. A real time saver on the job
4,Good product for the price,"I have used this attachment for quite a while, and it works fairly well. Agree with another review that the protrusions to align the stapler should be longer. That aside, the adapter works as advertised. It has the advantage and disadvantage of tool-less installation - it installs quickly and easily once you get the hang of it, but have had a couple fall off and get lost on the job site. I prefer the stapler to the roofing gun because it is lighter, the staples are more compact and easier to carry than coil nails, and the stapler is more versatile than the roofing gun. I generally use 1 1/4 staples for vinyl installation, but can quickly change to 2"" staples to install fascia, sheathing, almost anything below 1x or less. And the staples cost slightly less than the roofing nails. Good product - my wish list would be longer protrusions and design that would let the attachment engage and disengage (ie slide or flip in and out). That would change my rating to 5 stars."
2,Total Disappointment,"This watch looks kind o cheap and I did not see the quality of Victorinox in it, it was for a present and I ended up giving it to someone else. Purchased a Wenger a couple of days latter for less and it looks and feels better than this one."
2,Authentic?,"I just bought this watch elsewhere (from REI), and this one is NOT like the one that I bought. The dial numbers are different colors, as well as the hands and the dial face. I just wonder if this watch is authentic, because the one that I bought is very, very nice, and quite beautiful, which doesn't match the impression of the previous reviewer. This one looks a good deal cheaper (and it DOES cost significantly less than the recommended $350 that this watch usually sells for). Just thought I'd let potential buyers know."
1,poor customer service,Over 1 month and still haven't received it. When things go wrong with Amazon they REALLY go wrong!
5,Zatoichi Challenged,"Another excellent entry in the series. The interplay between Zatoichi and the young boy he becomes protector slows down the film a bit. The story behind the boy's father is rather interesting as a glimpse into Japanese culture and what is considered ""obscene"" in pre-modern Japan. This one features some of the best cinematography, particularly shots of the Japanese wilderness and the scenes set in a quarry, where pottery clay is mined, are stunning."
3,That Roar Turned Out To Be Yawn...,"Sorry -- but the phrases ""great"" and ""quick read"" don't make it for me with this book -- the metaphor was almost too much of a stretch -- yes, there was some useful information about dealing with very powerful beings and the stories about actual lion tamers were somewhat interesting, but there just was not 273 pages of material here. My suggestion would be that you read ""The Lion's Tale"" summary at the end of each chapter and let sleeping cats lie."
2,lacking.,This book was disapointing. the sexual tension was drawn out and too sudden. Some authors can get away with this but Patricia didn't. I don't understand the characters motivations and didn't find the characters very likeable. That is not to say the book is crap but it is not at the same standard as i was expecting.
4,I Like...,"I love this girls voice. If you ask me, she should've been the winner of American Idol in her season. Although I love her voice and this song, her CD is lacking (if I am being totally honest). On her first effort out, I think she should've leaned more towards R&B;/Soul/Love Songs because it would've given her the opportunity to again, show everybody she's got chops!!Rick"
4,"Sassy and Classy, a Diva's performer","As Classy a song stylist to ever grace a stage, Melinda Doolittle proved to be one of American Idol's most remembered and talked about artists. Her renditions of known standards made audiences stand up and really listen to songs as if hearing them for the very first time; her voice was amazing, her tonal quality impeccable and her delivery both honest and passionate. Her sincerity, her spirituality and her desire to please and entertain, will make her one of the most enduring talents that showcase will ever produce."
5,"Great performance by a great singer, but...","Melinda Doolittle rocked AI a few years ago, and I (like so many others) was moved by her performance of My Funny Valentine. I was thrilled to find it available for download in its entirety, but I have to say...the background tracking is a bit overpowering. All those violins almost drown her out, and she's not as ""throaty"" sounding in this version as she was when she performed live on the stage. Great song and definitely an outstanding version by one of the greats, but I really wish it sounded more like the ""incredible"" version from AI."
1,Thanks for expances you made to me!,"Respected, I've received my perfumes today and I have to say that I am very angry with you. You wrote that shipping costs are 37.15 USD instead of real costs of 5.95 USD so that I had to pay taxes on this amount that was 5 times more! I sent you more than 3 E-mails till now and I still haven't received your reply. Why are you asking me for review when you don't mind for your customers? This behavour is a shame for one company such as AMAZON. I have no more words for you anymore. Wish you long life. Good bye!"
1,Lack of Information,I learned only when the boilers arrived that they could not be used on glass surfaced stoves. I gave them to my sister who told me she liked them. I have no opinion.
3,Great cheap enamel pots are hard to find,"It's difficult to find cheap enamel pots nowadays, that's why I bought this item. Unfortunately the quality is cheap: no metal guard around the rim * much thinner and lighter than my old Polish enamel pots * the enamel is the type used for roasting pans, which is not totally smooth * after a few uses the enamel is wearing off on the inside bottom of the larger pot * hard to find a lid only and most universal lids are too big * lip is rounded and not designed to hold a lid. If you want cheap coverless enamel pots then this item is ok. If you want quality, durability, and a lid, then look elsewhere."
4,Great light utilitarian pans,I just wish that these pans came with lids. The metal is thin--perfect to warm up a quick soup and the like.
3,"for basic utility, they're okay","I just wanted these pans for temporary use until I moved and could invest in a quality set. They do the basics fine: boil water, cook oatmeal, boil eggs and potatoes. However, for some reason, the larger of the two seemed to lose part of its coating already and showed bluish discolorations on the interior bottom part of the pan. I would have sent them back but missed my opportunity by a few days. They're okay in a pinch for short term use. Also, beware of the handles getting very hot. You must use a potholder to pick them up after they have heated up, but they do cool down fairly quickly after cooking. I haven't used them long enough to know if that discoloration issue is a recurring theme. I would recommend them for emergencies while you wait out a good sale on the high quality stuff."
4,Decent covers,"The only Hammerfall original on here is ""At the End of the Rainbow..."" ""I Want Out"" is a cover of the 1987 Helloween classic tune, and ""The Man on the Silver Mountain"" is a remake of the Dio era classic. They do a nice job here, and Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray (and earlier Helloween) sings a few bars in each tune. However, Joacim Cans is unable to replicate the power that Dio possessed in the Rainbow cover... otherwise, it makes a worthy edition to any power metal collection."
5,I would definitely recommend this book.,"As a heavy consumer of intermediate-advanced italian grammar books, I found this to be more useful than most. The readings are interesting and come from real italian sources. This book emphasizes idiomatic speech and ways to learn on your own. One of the most useful out there."
5,A definte must for Italian students.,"I have been studying Italian for roughly about a year at college. With the possibility I might study abroad in Italy next year, I decided I might as well try to pre-emptively study the language before I resume classes in September. Reading through this book provided so many ""that makes so much sense!"" moments, one automatically feels that they have much more solid grasp of the language after only a few chapters. With real interviews of ordinary people, the book is a taste of what Italian is like, and not a series of scripted dialogues."
4,Teach yourself Italian Extra,"I bought this book to supplement the Italian course I'm doing at Uni.(college) and I've found it a very useful and cost-effective study tool. It is more logically set out than most texts and is relevant and up-to-date. It's major drawback is that it's designed to be used with a cassette (which I don't have) and although it is very good as a stand alone text, I have the feeling that it would be even better with the tape."
1,Worthless,"This is for 1st graders,if you have ever looked at a piece of steel your more advanced than this DVD. Waste of time and money , I purchased 3 of Covells tapes at once ,big mistake .... Nothing to learn if you ever took shop in high school you would be light years ahead of his tapes .Save your cash you can learn more by watching a kids cartoon."
1,Difficult to listen to,"I was unable to listen to the entire tape because I had difficulty 'hearing' the story. The woman chosen to narrate the book has a voice that is somewhat deep and gravelly that I found I had to really concentrate on instead of relaxing and letting the words flow over me as I do with most other audiotapes. At the beginning of the tape, music played in the background - which some people may like for the effect, but it was even more difficult to hear the narrator."
5,All you need in a stapler,I had a Bostich narrow crown stapler that spent more time in the shop than on my DIY projects. I checked around for a replacement and after reading the reviews and finding a great price on Amazon I ordered the PC. It works great and has all the power that I need. I have put several hundred staples through this gun without a glitch. It is light weight and thus no problem in holding it up to overhead jobs such as the soffit job I am doing on the exterior of my home. It is leaps and bounds better than the Bostich I used to have.
5,Durable and Easy,"When my previous stapler ""disappeared"" I was forced to replace it. As compensation, Porter-Cable added a couple of new features that really improve the product. It was already a good, reliable tool.The foot pad no longer falls off into black dirt (I used to keep a couple of spares). An easy adjustment changes the stapler from single shot to ""pounce"". Best of all, the depth is easily adjustable without having to mess with compressor pressure, using the simple finger dial.I used the earlier model to apply cedar shingles to my two-story house and the newer model to put them on the new garage, as well as a number of miscellaneous jobs.This is one case that really is ""new and improved."""
4,Stapler review,Great tool...worked perfectly right out of the box. Just a couple of minutes to understand all the functions then I put it to use.
3,"Not up to Porter-Cable standards, but adequate","I own Porter-Cable finish, brad, and framing nailers that are all excellent. Practically no down time while I've finished construction on my house. None of those nailers have had problems with misfiring. The framing nailer needed some maintenance after one year, but the finish nailer has fired over 2500 times without a hiccup. Not so with this brad nailer. It got about five shots off before it started needing two trigger pulls for every staple. Workable, but annoying. I would give my other Porter-Cables five stars each, but this one is only half as good. I don't have any experience with other brands to compare staplers--maybe stapling is harder to do right? Anyway, it gets you there in the end if you're willing to deal with the need for extra shots."
1,skippy nailer,No luck at all with this crown stapler.The stapler skips every other time.Not recomended .
4,great for the price,"I havent had mine very long so it gets 4 stars .I have fired 1/2"" , 3/4"" , and 1"" staples in various materials without fail thus far . I strenghtened a 250 year old dresser made of old oak and hickory ( no jams ) .I wish it had a empty mag lockout and was oiless but I can live with these gripes .I favor the double action trigger and have not had any double fires to date. I run 80 psi line pressure and then use the depth wheel for tuning further ( If firing lots of staples on rapid fire it will creep a little. In all I love this unit ( Mine came with 1000 1"" staples ),oil and a case."
5,You need this book,This is the one book you can buy that will get you working on all the Unix operating systems. It also works OK for Linux. It is well organized and easy to use. Much quicker than going on-line for answers.
2,typical feel-gooder,when you think someone has applied zen to business practices you think maybe someone has been able to put the zen into some perspective through the real world not just again put the real world into some perspective through zen. people in the real (or should i say ugly) world need to have a bridge built to get them half-way there with some new and very straight forward practices that can be applied. (so far) this book is just a reminder how everyone should practice zen - even busy business people.
1,It's official,This CD proves the Earth is on a one way terror train goin straight to H E double toothpicks! Strap yourself in!
1,Haven't heard it...,"Haven't heard it, just the clips. But those are pretty darned bad, and usually you put the best parts up... and if those are the best.. ick! I'm a classically trained singer, that means I'm more of the operatic pure singing type instead of this ""pop"" stuff which (in my opinion) resembles the sound of hiccupping, but even so, I sware I can perform better pop/rock than these kids! The clip that got me the most was ""A Whole New World"" - it's was so painfully nasal-ly! Not to mention the stupid covers on all American Junior CD's, they try to dress ""cool"" and look like they have attitude. They just look dumb... it's sorta sick."
3,American Juniors CD,Morgan Burke is the most amazing singer in the entire world!! He is my idol!!! visit my website for more info !! http://www.freewebs.com/mburkehot
1,Music Choice Tricked Me!,"I am reviewing the American Junior's 2003 debut, Kids In America.I only listened to three tracks and that's all I could take! Howdid I even get this CD? I was tricked by Music Choice! I was watching Radio Disney when their song ABC (the only song I like from them) came on. They told me it was on this CD, but the truthis, I just found out five minutes ago that the song is really ontheir self-titled soph CD. I gave it to my grandma because it hascover songs she said she would like. Good news, I ordered it froma CD mag for free! Bad news, the three songs are stuck in my head!"
4,Aren't you all being a bit harsh?,"Hmm, reading how cruel some people have been in their reports, I can't help but wonder how many of you could sing on stage when you were 11, or even how many of you can hold a tune in the shower now. These are CHILDREN, and that is part of their talent. Yes, some of them do sound rather young, but they are young. I've been performing since a very young age, but I certainly couldn't have give as slick a performance as every one of those kids manages when I was that age. Personally, I think you should be ashamed of yourselves for slating something which shows true talent beginning.I look forward to hearing more of the American Juniors in the future - I'm sure we will. It's a great album and I'm certainly glad I've bought it. :)"
4,Colors Of The Wind,"Why are people saying they go chills up their spine when Daniellesang this? It was WAYYYY to computerized. It did not show off hernatural, beautiful voice. It was good but people seem to beoverexagerrating a bit. Its not the best on the cd by farrr."
4,America Junior's cd,"I think that this was a pretty good album for their first one. Each kid sang very good during their songs and did an awesome job in One Step Closer and Kids in America. I have to say, I liked Chantel's song Open Arms the best."
1,"Oh My, On You Go, Copy Every song You can Think of!","I can't believe some irritating american kids would copy s club juniors - one step closer who sing 110% better than them (and thats sayin sumthin) and then on da otha album they copy the Jackson 5! Michael jackson sings ABC much better too because he is the King of Pop, and then copy s Club 7, who's next Britney?"
2,It's Okay but then it starts to suck a little,I just used to love them but after awhile I get bored of all there singing it's just so last year I didn't enoji the CD that much and if u saw the show it's enough sorry kids that are talented on the show u just don't do it for me I'd Rather Own every American Idol CD rather than this one.
1,chaos princess,"OH please only heard bit and pieces, and that was enough leave it up to the big kids this was a bad idea gone very bad. Who is ever gonna remenbers any of these youngsters? Most of thier voices have not even matured yet."
1,SO SO WRONG! ENOUGH WITH THE AMERICAN IDOL MADNESS!,"Can this get anymore anoying, what's next, Ryan Seacrest singing?, at least Paula Abdul should get a cd out, it's more worth it, than this, sorry kids I'm not tryin' to put you down, and by means I think you're talented, but America needs a rest from American Idol."
4,Very Good!,"Some of these kids are better then the older idols.The standouts are: Morgan Burke, fanastic on ""Build Me Up Buttercup"" Tori Thompson (who channels Natalie Maines on ""Let er Rip"") and Danielle White, who was voted in last. God knows why cause she was the BEST of them, and this track proves it. She is the one to watch of the band, she has an amazing voice, and actually feels the song, the emotion is right there in it. Amazing. The only bad thing is Lucy Hale, who was amazing on the show, is sattled with a song that is not worthy of her talent. She sung plenty of songs that were better on the show.Everyone else does well too, and I liked most of the song selections."
5,This CD is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,I bought this the day it came out and I couldn't stop listenin to it lol!!! These kids are soooo talented!!!!
4,We re Kids in America Wowwow,"I just got this album , and i thought its fantastic album...Of course my favorite is song Kids in America, i have the original one sang by Kim Wilde, who can top it off Kim Wilde...many pop stars tried but didn't work, however, i think American Juniors did a great job.Other songs cought myattention, Open arms, One step...Over all its very FUN listen to."
4,Good Sax!,"Not only is Joe Johnson a good musician, I admire the fact that he is donating a portion of the proceeds to further research of lupus. Very worth cause, and very noble!"
1,Will it ever end...,"I absolutley loved Perdido Street. This was a boring, drawn out book. It seemed to drag on forever, and I couldn't wait for it to end."
2,Not Mieville's best work.,"I'm a big fan of both Perdido Street Station and The Scar, compared to these earlier works Iron Council was a huge disappointment in both the writing and story. It was at times very painful to read and I was so excited to finally be finished. If you are new to Mieville, start with Perdido Street Station, if you are a big fan and looking for more from New Crobuzon be prepared to be disappointed."
3,Conceptually interesting,"This book is extremely slow moving. I was almost completely done with the book before I really understood why I was even reading the book.The world is incredibly different from ours because the characters are not human, and not homogeneous. I usually enjoy complex books, but there was so much initial complexity in the character base, that added in with the non linear nature of the story line, I just never got inside the book.The story was interesting, and by the end of the book, I really enjoyed not only the main character, but several of a ancillary ones as well, but as a whole I didn't like the book as it came off as too disjointed."
3,Good Book,"I am a recent fan of China Miéville, and love the world of these books. This book was great for the most part, but ended a little weak. Worth the read I think, but not his best."
1,Read Something Else,"All right, I picked this book up because it had been nominated for the 2005 Hugo. Iron Sunrise (By Stross), also nominated for the 2005 Hugo was brilliant.Iron Council is not. Actually, it's just plain awful. It's impossible to figure out what is going on, who the different factions are, or why we should care about them. Worse, there is no explanation for the rules of how the planet works. It's a bad mishmash of fantasy and steampunk rather than science fiction. And it does not work as any of the above.I'm on page 110 or so, and only because it was the only book I had on a business trip.Don't waste your time with this one."
2,This train moves slowly and the destination isn't worth the trip.,"I have to add my vote to the other reviewers who found this book to be a disappointment. Everything good in the first two books falls flat in this one. I suspect Mieville was dissatisfied also because he completely changed gears with The City and City. That book is a must read and succeeds on all the levels Iron Council fails at. The City and the City isn't really even a fantasy novel but it seems so much stranger and deeper. It takes you to a place you've never been but will recognize-Iron Council takes you to a graveyard of elements of other, better books."
2,Interesting but tedious,"This is my first Mieville book, and it was less thrilling than expected. I couldn't get into the characters or the plot, at least til the very end. I found the language almost trying too hard to be ""unique"", and it made it less pleasant to read. I'll try it again after I read Perdido Street Station, however."
3,Just not the same,"I loved PSS and Scar but just could not get into this book. I figured after I kept reading it would start to gel, maybe after a couple hundred pages. But I never got absorbed, never got into the characters' heads. I kept hoping it would make me feel the way the first 2 books did but unfortunately it never did. Disappointing."
4,Get lost in a different world,The style of the work allows the reader to go there and be there. To have an interesting tale to be involved in then becomes just a bonus.Good read. Read Perdido Street station first though -a work that complies with the same qualities.
2,lacked the texture and drama of earlier mieville,"I keep finding myself wandering away from this novel after devouring the first two bas lag novels. For me, his description of the outlands really lacks the texture of New Crobuzon and the story is missing the drama of the earlier titles. While the novel tries to dramatize revolutionary impulse growing at the edge of a civilization, I think it may be too intellectual an exercise - too abstract."
2,Nothing to engage with,"I had trouble with the beginning of Perdido Street Station, but by the end of the book had to admit that it had been fun. I thought the Scar was excellent. This book just didn't do it for me. I don't think there was a single character for the reader to identify with. Reads more like a history book than a novel. No real plot, no real action. I'll ask around carefully before I buy Mieville's next book."
3,Deserved a Better Ending,"Iron Council is painted with words and phrases, China Mieville has not disappointed me yet on that front. The intrigues and sub plots were deep and complex. His detailed approach to describing exploitation as manifested by the ""remade"" is striking. The authors attempts at describing the horrors of the exploited provide a sense of relevance today, as many of these exploited do work against their own self interest, even as those in power try to end the legendary influence these ""less than humans"" have..The sense of duty the Iron Council adheres to is admirable, they deserved a better ending. I honestly felt his ending was an abdication. Even if he were to write a sequel to this book, the characters in the Iron Council deserved better than what they got at the end of this book. Those characters deserved closure, even if that closure would make you sick with grief."
2,Bas-Lagomorph,"The review by stnmikita almost exactly reflects my own view of Iron Council. Perdido Street Station and The Scar are exsquisite (PDS being the best). But I bogged down in Iron Council and did not finish it. I am re-reading PDS and enjoying it more than I did the first time, if that is possible. Out of my respect for Mieville I will go back and give Iron Council another go."
3,It was OK,"The storyline and the writing is very good, but I had a hard time getting through this Bas Lag book. Maybe it was because I had a hard time caring for the main characters of the story, yes they are fighting an injustice in their world but I didn't really care. I'm not sure why. The Scar is by far the best Bas Lag book and the characters in that story are much more appealing. I think that The Scar's story is much more engrossing than Iron Council"
3,Falls Short of Perdido St. Station and The Scar,"Read this on its own terms. If you read this expecting something better than or as good as Mieville's other Bas-Lag books, then you will be disappointed. Iron Council is a slow starter. If you can last for the first hundred or so pages, then you will be rewarded with a more richly-textured view of Bas-Lag. I again marvel at Mieville's imagination. His detailed somaturgy is a pleasure to read."
1,Disappointing,"I have the German version of this book and it is really, really fabulous. This, as another reviewer said, is woefully elementary and thus very disappointing. I got it very in expensively in good condition but I would not recommend the purchase of this unless you are a super beginner."
3,Poor quality plastics,"After 2 practices with them on, the plastic piece that holds the scratch band broke...So I had to take those scratch bands off, and I feel a little bit less secured for my knee.But even though I don't recommend this pair of shoes, overall, I would recommend NB because they have quite a good expertise in basketball equipments."
2,FYI: Size of each cannoli form,"Rated 2 stars because product description didn't include actual size or the material.Material I think is aluminum because magnets don't stick to it.Size of each rod is 3/4"" in diameter and 5-5/8"" long. Diameter is too small for cannoli IMHO...really wanted something 1.5"" in diameter. Can't return or I'd get smacked $5.17 for return fees :-P"
2,cannoli forms,I was disappointed in this product. They advertise it as having a 1 in dia. but it was only 3/4 in . They still worked though.
3,only place to get themI,"I needed to get a set of cannoli molds because I'm gluten free and wanted to make them for the holidays. I couldn't find them anyplace but here, so I ordered them. They came in a reasonable amount of time, but they were much smaller than what I would ordinarily have used. I won't send them back because it was difficult enough to find them, but these are for the mini cannolis, not the usual size. Buyer beware (and yes I read the description, I just thought they were the size I wanted and there were not many choices)"
4,Work great,Easy to use. My husband was very happy with his gift. We had been looking for these for a while.
1,crap - these are not real cannoli forms,"these are simply metal tubes. a real cannoli form is not a full circle, it is rolled so that you can squeeze them a little bit to get the cannoli shells out without breaking them."
5,Yummy,"Love these, they arrived fast and in great condition. I make Cannoli's all the time now. This is good since San Antonio have no good bakeries they are all hispanic not italian, french or polish."
2,Not the best,Very small in dia and length would be better nearly twice the size.Well made and finished. But bigger is better some times
2,Inferior Quality,"The Fox Run Cannoli Forms, Set of Four are inferior quality. They are not even stainless steel. In fact, they look and feel more like tin. The diameter is significantly smaller than stated and several of the ones I received had dents on the side. I do not recommend Fox Run Cannoli Forms."
2,WHAT ARE THESE THINGS MADE OUT OF??? ANYONE?,I guess my question would be what are these things made of? Are they metal or aluminum? I don't cook with anything that is aluminum since for years many of us in the science community clearly know that cooking with aluminum increases your chances of getting alzheimers.........I don't want this. But the ad does not state what alloy this item is and not only that it does not state where item is made. I prefer buying from US of A. Not China......... Support our country please!!
5,this cable does the job,"used this cable to run from my router to my netgear switch, which I have my ROKU plugged into. I bought all of these here at Amazon: cable, switch, and the Roku."
4,I really enjoyed this book,"This was a book which stayed with me, I guess because it was very personally told unlike so many biographies, and even some autobiographies. The woman was a Jungian practicer, and the Jungean way of perceiving life is evident throughout. The details were simple, directly stated - the book was very engrossing."
1,"Applies to the $9.99 ""high quality paperback"" version only","This text is amazingly useful, and as a text alone, I would give it a 5-star rating. I purchased it on Kindle, realized I needed a paper copy for my research, and bought the $9.99 ""high quality paperback"" version.However, this is literally the ugliest book in my house. It looks like it was constructed at Kinko's. I don't know quite what I was thinking here - perhaps that it was a placeholder icon instead of an actual version of the book. The cover actually does say ""HIGH QUALITY PAPERBACK"" and ""AFFORDABLE AND HIGH QUALITY PAPERBACK BOOK EDITION"", the spine is blank grey, the pages are not very firmly set, and the font is a faded Courier. Unless you are a college student who will never touch this text again after your class is over - please, please find a different edition."
5,Gods and Fighting Men- by Lady Augusta Gregory,Lady Gregory has written a very precise and easily read translation of some of the best of Irish mythology. Originally written at the turn of the ninetteenth century it still holds today.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Celtic mythology and lore.
2,on and on...,"I'm glad this book has been kept in publication because it is a kind of historical record, although it would have been nice if Forgotten Books had shown more respect and spent more time keeping the typos down.It seems the book is a compilation of stories, a bit willy-nilly. The problem I had was the style of story telling and the endless droning effect it had on me. And, the stories themselves were often comprised of various people going about Ireland or the world whacking each other over the head. Even though an occassional nobility of character was mixed in that didn't save the tales from a dreary sameness as to how one interacts with the world.Gotta give it a 2."
5,10 years later,"There is often a stigma associated with the reunion album - people are generally left thinking if the band can actually live up to their former esteem and make an album that doesn't just make one nostaglic but enthralls the listener...i am happy to say, Lifetime's new self-titled album - does just that. It's hard to believe that Jersey's Best Dancers came out ten years ago taking that the band sounds like they could have put this album out right after they put out JBD. Lifetime (album) is filled with catchy pop-punk Yemin guitar hooks and Ari's introspective lyrics - Its refreshing to hear something like this after the scene's recent domination (or drowning out) of the youth crew revival sound. Thank you Lifetime, you surpassed my expectations."
5,Bravo 2 the Pied Piper of R&B,"Now ya'll can't go wrong on the man. Y'know R. Kelly. Don't even mess w/ the R. if u don't luv him or else maybe you'll try 'em out 4 instance. That s**t was bangin when I catched on the radio and on the Music Choice channel to see it's good. I just wanna congrats on R. Kelly 4 doing such a good job. I'm proud of his success he did on his last 2 albums ""Chocolate Factory"" (2003) and ""Happy People/U Saved Me"" (2004) (y'know the one I haven't copped yet). I'm still a big fan to the musical genius himself who puts out great stuff. Look forward for his next album to drop ASAP in the summer or so. my main man MisterMaxxx is such a huge fan 2 the R. Y'knowwhattamean.Yeah the R. could be known as the Marvin Gaye of our time 2day. I give 4.5/5, 10/10 (A-) for doing such a wonderful job. Can't wait 2 hear the rest!!!"
3,R.'s the only one that can get away with this,"When I first heard In The Kitchen on R.Kelly's Chocolate Factory tour two years ago, I had a feeling this song was going to be big. Now two years the song has finally been released as a single and it's really nothing special. The lyrics are very corny and amaturish but because he's R. Kelly he can get away with it. Let a REAL singer like Gerarld Levert or Johnny Gill talk about Tomato Soup Cans and bread rolls the public would have a field day. The second song on the CD Trapped is nothing more than Down Low Part 2 with the vocals sounding worse, I mean R, sounds like he's smoking a crack pipe or something. The final song In The Kitchen remix is a tad bit better than the oringial because you can groove to it more, but why Mr. Kelly decided to talk nonsense for like a minute before the song started is beneath me. Here's hoping that the future singles are better than this."
4,Excellent roofing/siding nailer,"I honestly wanted to buy the Bostitch and it really is a better roofing nailer. I went with the P-C because it was almost $100 less, is lighter, and came with a case. Not being a big, burly carpenter I need tools that just don't weigh so much. The P-C was an excellent combination of all the criteria important to me. After using the RN175 for a while I find it to be well balanced, reliable and easy to use throughout the day."
4,All About the Blues,"Bought this box set recently in a store discounted to $18. Unbelievable value at that price. I have lots of blues compilations, but few are as good as any one of these CD's. The music is original; many songs are not ""standards"" or are engaging variations, and most importantly, overall give a real feel of presence. Listened to all 4 on a car trip and felt like I spent the night in a top blues club. In two words: Real Smooth."
3,Gospel greats tribute Dottie Rambo,"This tribute to a wonderful singer/songwriter is somewhat mixed. It starts fairly slowly and low key. The program then moves on with some of the gospel music greats including Vestal Goodman, Jese Dixon, The Isaacs and many others. Some of the groups are a bit thin. The Speer family consists only of Ben Speer (not that you can really hear him much) and two unidentified relations. One or more of the songs received overwhelming applause, but evidently only due to the loud singing!. Then again how can you miss when you have greats like Jesse Dixon, Dottie Rambo and Vestal Goodman singing together. Dolly Parton and Dottie singing Stand by the River is a real treat."
3,I expected more,"Body Shop is a household name and a corporation with an atttitude. Anita built the company on her beliefs and always stood for what she believed in.I was a little disappointed with this book. I was expecting to read about how she started the company, what drove her to start, her fears, etc but what I found was a book filled with her philosophies mixed with her story on how she grew her business. If you're doing an MBA, yes by all means, this is a great book as it gives you different and fresh business perspectives but if you're looking for a ""how I made it book"", you may be a little disappointed."
5,"How businesses can be about public good, not private greed","Anita Roddick is the founder of The Body Shop and is a leading spokesperson for corporate social responsibility who has used her successful business acumen to demonstrate that business decisions based on moral leadership is a sound and profitable model for today's competitive and global marketplace. In Business As Unusual Roddick charts the ups and downs of her business, while sharing her vision of how all businesses can be about public good rather than private greed. Her own company, The Body Shop, is an example of her message concerning corporate responsibility and commitment to human rights and social issues with its 1500 stores serving 86 million customers in 47 markets and 24 languages. Highly recommended reading for MBA students, aspiring entrepreneurs, and corporate managers at all levels of responsibility."
3,Neutral,I am sure it will work for someone very much into cutting sandwiches for their child but this one is bigger than the normal slice of bread
3,IT'S OK,"NOT BAD FOR WHAT IT IS......GOOD GIFT FOR ANY STAR WARS FAN WHO LIKES TO COOK..... NOT TO BAD OF A PRICE FOR THIS, JUST SHOULD BE A LITTLE LARGER"
3,Size,"It's a little smaller than I was expecting, but I think it will work just right:) Can't wait to make the cookies:)"
3,Is Little Pim for little kids,Little Pim is an ok dvd but it really does not hold my granddaughter's attention for long ...It would've been nice if the french was followed by english.
1,Not a good resource,"I have used this book in a college level French class. It was a very big waste of my time and money. I was totally unprepared to continue on in French, and I had a professor to whom I could pose questions. It is confussing, frustrating and poorly organized. If you think using this book is a replacement for taking a class to learn French, you are misled. I would only recommend this system to people who at one time knew French and want to stimulate old knowledge. For first time learners, this is a bad resource."
1,"I don't believe the so-called ""immersion"" method","An adult needs all the help his mature abilities can bring, including the language he knows to mirror and bridge the language he is learning. The ""French only"" method seems to me almost idiotic. It didn't work for me and I know I am not alone. I love French and have kept my eyes on all the self-study French courses available in the States.Besides, French may not change much but the video is around 20 year old."
4,good sound,I am a new violin player. This is a good set of strings for a student violin. They have a nice sound. I would buy again.
4,Kontum Lessons,"As a fellow Vietnam veteran, I found Paul Reed's diary memorable and moving. All of us should be thankful his mother saved his keepsakes which motivated Paul Reed to follow his heart and reconcile not only with the man who wrote the diary but also with himself. The book is well written and reflects the author's courage in facing an incendiary time in his life and the life of the nation. His book contributes to the healing process."
4,Gripping,"Ignore the Publishers Weekly review. This book's ""detached"" narrative style makes the horrors of what Paul Reed experienced all the more chilling. Publishers Weekly's negative characterization of Reed is also idiotic -- the book does NOT, in my opinion, give a ""simplistic"" portrait of Reed. Someone must have paid the PW reviewer to trash this book. War is horrible, and this book conveyed that to me better than many others. Get it. Read it."
1,Not even a cap gun!,"Don't buy this if you are looking for a cap gun that fires roll caps! False advertising here. It DOES NOT FIRE CAPS at all! It merely ""clacks,"" when the hammer falls. I looked long and hard to find a roll cap rifle for my son. I thought I had found a winner, but this isn't it."
4,Mixed opinion,"Haven't really had any problem with AT&T so far. They helped me a great deal, including canceling an unactivated account (long story here), port my mobile number, and fix problems on my phone bill. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because the representatives sounded unenthusiastic and not very willing to help. They spoke in monotone that says ""god I hate my job I hate AT&T so why don't you just hang up"" however if you press on they will help you. I've called them 4 times in total (problems solved each time I called), three of them were like this, the other lady was very enthusiastic and pleasant and very very sweet and nice on the phone. I really enjoyed that particular conversation but the rest was just mediocre and blegh."
3,Good Not Great.,"In this film, Abbott & Costello get Abbott's sister enroled in an all girls school.The guys are brought along as caretakers. The best performance is from ""The Man with A Thousand Faces"" Lou Chaney. Some fair gags but not their best."
5,ABBOTT & COSTELLO GO TO COLLEGE,"Classic 1945 Abbott & Costello comedy. Bud and Lou play caretakers at an all girls school, and turn on it's ear with zany results. BEST highlight of the film is the WILD AND ZANY basketball game sequence. Lou disguises himself as a girl to help out his Bixby College. During the game he gets bonked on the head and develops amnesia,and Bud convinces him that he's ""DAISY DIMPLE"", the WORLD'S GREATEST FEMALE BASKETBALL STAR. [Note: All the trick shots in the game were ACTUALLY performed by Lou Costello himself]."
1,Got the wrong book,"They show the third edition in the illustration, but for some very strange and stupid reason they offer the second edition, which is not that good."
4,this girl was crazy.,I read the book. At parts i get bored then it would pick up again. These case still on going. Neither one been put to death yet.
5,Shocking,"I was very happy with my purchase. The item arrived in excellent condition. This is a must read book, I was not able to put it down. The actions of this police was downright Shocking!"
1,No one could remember her?,"Mr. Hustmyre wrote about the life of ms. Frank with the same attention to detail that one would give a mill bred pit bull. Come on really? This book is a waste of time. The same tired true crime procedural formula, with attention to human detail given to only the ""good guys"", and the last half of the book dedicated to a tired recital of the court reporter's trial notes.Another waste of time and cash."
3,Very interesting,"I enjoyed this book. Had a trip planned to New Orleans and was able to actually find some of the historic sites mentioned in the book, which made it all the more intriguing. Motive was not clear to me."
5,Killer with a Badge,"Being a south Louisiana Retired Law Enforcement Officer and very familiar with the actual incident described in this book and knowing the author since his early years in Law Enforcement, I was a little skeptical about this read, but was looking forward to reading it. I was flabbergasted. It is an exceptional book. One that was hard to put down, even for a break. the story he tells was accurate and the way he tells it puts the reader right in the middle of the investigation. Anyone who enjoys Crime Novels will rate the book as one of the best. I recommend it highly. I'm now eagerly waiting for the release of his next book, which I understand is a fiction novel. With talent the author has in telling a story, it can't help but be another great read."
3,nice but expensive,"This short novel stands halfway between porn and romance, a mix I usually find agreeable as long as the writing is good.Here the author exaggerates with her use of vernacular, probably trying to sound realistic.Ms Tortuga tells us the story of Dean and Will, two cowboys in the rodeo circuit: they meet, they fall for each other, the overcome heavy but ""normal"" problems and live happily ever after. Dean is older (we are told he could be Will's father), but the passion between the two is believable: I loved how the author avoids melodrama but conveys an intense and growing passion.Sex scenes are very explicit despite the abuse of adjectives.The price is far too high, though."
2,"Good Idea, Wrong Setting","Whether Noel Hynd (as ""reviewer"" Natalie Hernandez)is taking swipes at Ferrigno or not, he is right.This would have been a much better book if it was set in the Muslim Europe of the next century.Face it folks, if anyone adopts Islam it will be the quickly degenerating Northern and Western Europeans. They will have to beacause the growing Middle Eastern/South Asian/North African populations there will eventually come to dominate and they will force it on native Europeans."
4,More frightening now...,"... than a year ago when I read it. Back then I found it to be a good but disturbing book, hence the 4 stars. The plot is catching, the characters are quite well-drawn but the description of a muslim-led US of A in a quite near future is so plausible that I felt a bit edgy reading it. A year later, when you see the Obama NEW YORKER cover which- unfortunately enough- might be used to be the cover of this piece of fiction, you can't help but think of this novel and that's quite troubling. A must-read and a very good one, to see where extremism might lead us to."
5,Prayers4TheAssassin,This is an unusual read yet well worth the effort. U never know if this will really happen either !
4,4 1/2 stars,"I don't generally read futuristic type novels, but since this has been one of my favorite authors I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did. You'll find yourself wrapped in the world the author has created. He provides a suspenseful and affecting plot that should please all thriller fans. It's also a scary look at what radicals are capable of both now and in the future.Do I see this as the start of a series? Here's hoping, because Rakkim Epps is my kind of hero.Highly recommended."
1,Yet somehow it rated a sequel,"Enjoying this book doesn't require mere suspension of disbelief if you're not an unrepentant dittohead. Rather, much like every character in this book, you have to completely deactivate your brain, because that's the only way you're going to accept the initial premise of rogue Israelis nuking New York City, probably the most stereotypically Jewish city on Earth outside of Israel, resulting in a Fox News pundit's nightmare of the US somehow converting en masse to al-Qaeda-style Islam. Seriously, why would there be a complete transplanting of Arab culture here like some bad episode ofSliders - The First and Second Seasons?Unless this is a satire and I completely missed the joke, this comes off as pandering to a crowd that uses the term ""homicide bomber"" and still hasn't figured out that acting like a bloodthirsty, trigger-happy berserker isn't the best way to sell Christianity in all its variations to the religiously unaffiliated."
2,Never Hooked Me,"I kept waiting for the story to draw me into the book, but it just never happened. If I were to attach a label, I would designate this as a 'concept' work. In other words, without the underlying concept of an Islamic nation governing on U.S. soil, the book really did not offer anything to make it stand out.I'll give the author credit for attempting to tackle a topic sure to make many Americans uneasy, but the characters simply did not lift a run of the mill story. Behind the curtain of the Islamic concept, the general plot could have been easily transformed into countless other political storylines.With a relatively bland storyline, the characters need to shine. In this case, with the excpetion of Darwin, all of the characters have been done before in different settings. I may still give the sequal a chance, as the concept is an interestine one. But, I'm hoping the characters develop some depth and the plot adds some true intrigue."
3,The edginess is gone,"Ferrigno writes some of the best thrillers today, edgy, exciting and well plotted. I tried to suspend belief for ""Prayers for the Assassin, but too much of it just didn't ring true. America capitulating so easily? I just couldn't find it remotely possible. I think there may have been too much of an attempt to promote a political agenda while criticizing the opposite agenda. The writing is, as always solid, and the pace the usual fast clip, but unlike previously interesting characters, none of the heroes are the least bit likable, and almost every other character is shallow and nothing more than cliched.My suggestion would be to take it from the library if you have to read it, but save the cash for a better effort from another of your favorite thriller writers."
4,An Interesting Story,"I admit, a bit far fetched, but the thought of Islam taking over the US is intreging. This is an alternate history and fiction so I sat back, read and enjoyed. I haven't read any of Robert Ferrigno's other books so I have nothing to compare this with. However, I did enjoy the book, it was a quick easy read and did make me think. No I don't think it could really happen, even under the circumstances in the story, but as I said this is fiction."
1,tom clancy meets ferigno,This book is so different and so poorly written that it is hard to believe that it was written by the author of great novels like scanvenger hunt and dead silent. the basis of the plot is clever but the characters and the flow of the story that revolve around the plot are one dimentsional.
4,Fine Thriller,"It's a surprisingly good thriller, with some memorable characters, an inventive plot, and well-realized backstory.The basic premise--the US turns Islamic--will cause some people hangups, but it's a worthwhile exercise. Like the Cold War thrillers that had the US under Soviet rule, the intent is not really prediction, but rather presenting the reader with a believable portrayal of another system within a familar context. The shock of the familiar and the foreign colliding creates a lot of opportunities for a good writer, and Ferrigno exploits them well."
5,As Near Perfect A Thriller As I've Ever Read,"Fresh, exciting, frightening, page turning, stunning, stellar. And scary as hell.You read this book hoping to both God and Allah that this won't happen, knowing how easily it could.Bravo Ferrigno! This is a five star, must read!"
3,Entertaining but weak ending,"I ate up the premise of the book...how could I resist reading about a fictional future of the U.S. that portends the very real possible future of Europe? Despite the premise and the decent plot, the story still seemed like a rushed airbrush of a story. And the ending, which could have provided much more suspense and rich content, was completely rushed. Almost felt like Robert had a deadline to meet."
2,Tepid,"I read this book because the afterward of a Colin Harrison thriller suggested that Ferrigno was an excellent thriller author. Harrison is being too modest: he's far more talented (at least if this book serves as an example). It had some potential, but the whole Muslim America things started to feel stale and forced by the end of the novel, and the action was pretty sparse. Lots of descriptions of American cities under Muslim thrall, but the descriptions never ""came to life"". It had none of the resonance of The Handmaid's Tale, which everyone loves to compare it to. It's a tired, rehashed story of a bad guy chasing a good guy chasing after a girl, with an uneven plot that wears thin about halfway through. The one saving grace: crackling dialogue."
1,open box,"I just received my stapler and the 10000 staples. No problem with the stapler but the box of staples had been opened and re-taped loosely and the 5"" strips of staples were broken into 1"" to 2"" pieces making loading them a real pain."
4,Shipping could have been better,"This is more a note to the vendor. The staples are fine and I had no problems shooting 3/4 of the box on my first project. I purchased a air stapler and 2 boxes of stables (different sizes). All three items were placed in a box and a couple of those plastic pillows were put in to fill the box. Everything was loose in the shipping box and both boxes of staples opened up during shipping spilling 20,000 staples into the shipping box where the individual loads of staples promptly broke into multiple pieces. It took me over an hour to separate the different staple sizes into piles. Forget about getting them back in the box. Then when I need to reload the gun, I had to pick and choose various sections to use. Very frustrating. Suggest that vendor securely tape the boxes of staples shut so they will not open up during shipping, or if you are buying, only buy 1 size at a time and have a zip lock bag ready to store all the pieces!"
1,"good staples, bad packaging","I ordered a couple of boxes of staples and both were open when received. Most of the staples had fallen out of one of the boxes and the were all broken into little pieces. When I ordered a replacement box, I explained what had happened. I received the new box fairly quickly.....it was opened and spilled inside the with some of the staples broken also. Won't order them again."
1,wrong item,it was the wrong item so I had to return it. but I think it would be useful to someonewho would need it.
1,GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR,DONT BUY THE POWER CORD IT GOES TO THE PS3 I THOUGHT I GOT THE WRONG ORDER BUT NOOOOOO ITS THE WRONG CORD!!!!! I GOT SOOOOO EXCITED TOO!!! GRRRRRRR OH SO VERY GRRRRRR!!!!! WASTING MY GOOD MONEY WILL YOU!! WELL I NEVER!!
1,Not for Xbox,"I got this item and it does not fit in my xbox. Now that I look at the site, the description on the bottom of the page says cord for Playstation 2. Don't buy this for an xbox."
1,no power,"The item came in a timely fashion as the shipment details said, the only problem is the chord did not work. :("
3,Its thinner that i thought,When you pint somethink with edible ink you will need a paper that resist enough ink to prevent the paper is lifted
5,great product,so glad I found this product. It is a great price and a super great product. It was all in good shape and exactly as stated
5,Great Product!!!,"This stuff is amazing and reasonable!!! At only 17 cents a sheet, it can be air-dyed any color and cut or paper-punched into ANY shape to be used as an edible decoration on cakes, cupcakes or any other confection."
3,Thought it was rice/sugar paper,"Great product, but I guess it was my mistake that I meant to order rice/sugar paper. Works okay, though. Thanks!"
5,Wonderful!,This paper is wonderful. It made the photos on the cupcakes look really natural. The taste if tried with or without the printing is delicious. Thank you!
1,DON'T BUY THIS CRAP,"I have been a fan of AFI for a while now and this does them no justice. I cried when i heard the classic ""Total Immortal"" covered by some crappy girl pop/punk band. If this is your first exposure to AFI's music I pity you. But at least they are not being covered by britney spears or nsync."
1,THIS IS TERRIBLE,I didn't even buy this CD... but I felt like I had to say something. I listened to the samples and they are extremely terrible. I love AFI more than any other band and hearing some crappy bands try and play AFI made me sick. This is awful.
1,Horrible,"Not only did the Cd sound horrible, but most of these bands in real life don't even like AFI. It seemed like a marketing thing to make money. This is a huge insult to the AFi community."
1,This one's for the junk pile,"This is the most pathetic tribute album to ever exist. I can't believe what these bands did to AFI's music. In a couple of the songs the bands change the lyrics, and completly change the sound of the song. I'm not against covers or tribute albums, but if you're gonna cover a song, especially by a band such as AFI, make it a good cover. Most of the stuff on this cd is just downright awful. I can't believe this was allowed to be done to AFI's music. If you're a fan of AFI, like I am, please stay away from this album, it's no good. I wish I could give it zero stars but I had to settle with one."
1,No!NO!NO! That's just wrong!,All I can really say is that it was a really bad and twisted version of the work of a Genius(THAT GENIUS BEING DAVEY HAVOCK!) and it really sucked and made me want to smash my radio into a millon tiny little pieces! Bad Idea guys!
1,...wow....really?,"I didn't even buy this album (thankfully), but just by the other reviews and the song samples I can tell what a complete piece of garbage this is. I'm actually just pissed off about it.Do these bands actually take these covers seriously? Do they even take AFI seriously?!In ""God Called In Sick Today"" the lead singer sings the chorus as if he's constipated. The whiny brats in ""Days of the Phoenix"" make me want to bash my head into the computer screen.These people should be ashamed of themselves, and I think they owe AFI an apology!!Just terrible!!"
1,What a hack job,"I never thought AFI songs could sound bad...until I heard this. Did whoever put this thing together purposely find the most talentless bands on the planet so they could destroy perfectly good AFI songs? This is almost painful to listen to.Oh, and I hope that Herman Melvill guy who did the last review was just joking around, or else he's the most uniformed individual I've come across...Totalimmortal ""written by the Offspring"", HA!...Good Charlotte being ""underground punk"", HAHA!...Good Charlotte being ""brilliant"" HAHAHAHAHA!"
1,disgusting,the only one that wasn't god awful was girls not grey and it was still pretty bad. overall a disgusting attempt at a tribute to an incredible band that deserves better
1,They just don't deserve the money,"I think this is interesting to listen to, but these guys are just trying to make money off of AFI. The bands are also quite terrible. God Called in Sick Today had to be one of the worst covers on the album. I Wanna Mohawk was terrible too. Not because it was too different from the original song, but because it was made by sluts! They also changed the lyrics, which is something you shouldn't do in a ""Tribute Album"". Weeb stayed pretty true to 31/2, but it was much weaker than the original. I mean, 31/2 was one of the most intense and vicious AFI songs. The band that did Ever and a Day, although weaker than the original, actually knew how to sing! (SURPRISE) Don't buy this album, and don't buy the ""Best of the Nitro"" CD either. It doesn't even have the best nitro songs on it!(It's also another attempt to rip off AFI)"
1,Only one star because there isnt a Negative,"Where on earth can anyone begin to decribe this horror!!!! My ears are angry with me now and never want to hear anything again! Never in my life have I wanted to smash a CD so badly. It is awful. Just thinking about it will give me nightmares. Not one of these bands could carry a tune if it was in a freakin basket!!!! AFI music should be left for Davey to sing. His voice is far too beautiful to be butchered in such a way as these bands did. My boyfriend and I were both even offended by this CD. It is really that bad!!!! Please, especially if you are a musician, DO NOT BUY THIS AWFUL CD. Its so called ""music"" made me sick."
1,Why Aren't ZERO stars possible?,"It pains me to see a band with such passion and talent for music so utterly destroyed by these awful bands. What a waste of money, time, breath, and sanity. Half of the so-called ""artists"" on this cd should be banned from recording any more garbage. This album is the prime example of the opposite of a tribute. It's just awful. Buy ""Black Sails at Sunset"", or ""Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes"" instead of this! Or, if you have listened to this massacre of music, listen to some realy A.F.I. to cleanse this garbage out of your system."
1,"THE BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME, MONEY, EFFORT, ANYTHING!!","Absolutly terrible, not one of these bands are friends with AFI. A GOOD tribute album would be done by bands that are friends with AFI, like The Distillers, Rancid, Tiger Army, and Death By Stereo!"
1,THIS CD SUCKS.,"This was the worst tribute cd i hve heard in my life. AFI is a good band, and it is awful to have their amazing music ruined by female singers who need to get their hands out of their pants and bands who can't play the songs. THE AFI TRIBUTE CD MADE ME WANT TO KILL MYSELF."
3,Great cover cd,"I absolutely love AFI but i don't listen to them 24/7 as apparently the rest of the reviewers do.. I thought this was a great cd. Sure the songs aren't EXACTLY like the originals but that's not what a cover cd is about. All of the bands injected their own flavor into the music and while some of them (Atlantis Black and Weeb) were a little strange, they did give the songs a different feel.. I loved all the rest of the covers. Basically if you're looking for another AFI cd look elsewhere. For the rest of you AFI fans that would like to hear the same old stuff with with a different taste this cd is definetely worth the $10. I would've given it 4 stars if i weren't afraid all these fanboys would hunt me down and kill me.."
1,You call this a tribute?,"More like a complete disgrace to AFI than a tribute. I would love to slap the moron that decided to put Totalimmortal on there. Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome song, but you can't put a cover of a song that AFI didn't even originally do on a tribute album. I haven't purchased this CD myself, but from what I hear on the sample sound clips, I doubt I want to. I would never consider paying money for this trash."
1,not a child btw - BEWARE OF BIAS,"I'm not too sure why you're all trying to compare a tribute album to AFI. This album was supposed to be another artists rendition of the album, not a complete copy of AFI.That being said, the album is terrible anyways. Some reviewers were just lieing to themselves; the selection of artists for this compilation is horrid, and the CD should never have been published. There are a few notable exceptions: GCIST cover is well done, I don't mind it; Now the World COULD have been better, but I think it was descent. That's about it though, everything else is just not worth mentioning.I hope some of you find this review helpful. I agree with a lot of people when I say don't go out searching for this; it's not worth it."
1,i am a huge afi fan.,"god..this cd is HORRIBLE.don't even let me get started on: ""i wanna mohawk but my mummy won't let me get one"" i know..i'm not too familiar with this tribute stuff...but i'm sorry..if a band cover a song...it shouldn't sound COMPLETELY different to the original song. sorry. that's just how it is.some of the songs were so badly covered i wanted to cover my ears cause the sound was so crap.let's just face it, afi are a phenomenal band..it's like islam or something...there are no idols allowed to be worshipped...as in...no idols can represent the true beauty of god...in this case no other crap band can cover and truly capture the beauty that is afi...sorry man. fans...DON'T buy this...it bloody sucks."
1,I DONT thrive on this self mutilation...,"Well, what can I say. The cover looked cool, so I made the hideous mistake of listening to the samples..I screamed in agony ""Oh God..save me!!!"" I was shocked to hear such twisted atrocities of AFI's songs, they made me want to stab myself in the neck with a screwdriver. Seriously! This album would be great for committing suicide to - it would get you right in the mood. I am disgusted to my very soul from listening to this awful crap, so I think I'll go listen to REAL AFI to clean my ears out.one good point---I can now truly appreciate how unique and amazing afi are.YUCK!!!!!MY EARS ARE EXCORIATING!!!"
1,Please tell me that this is a joke.,"i cant believe these bands that re did these songs. They take amazing AFI songs and totally slaughter them. This is an insult to AFI, one of the greatest bands in punk history. Dont ever buy this steaming piece of dog excrement. It is a dark day in punk history now that this ha been released."
1,Oh god!!,"well well well..I can't even put into words how upset i am. First of all, bands that sound like theyre playing in an elevator isn't cool anymore. second of all, IF your going to do a tribute album to this unexplainably awsome band, you should LEARN THE WORDS!!! not even worth listening to.. it'll just piss you off."
1,Actually this is my moms name but I MUST review this.,"Terrible. They butchered most of the AFI songs but the main reason I wanted to write this review was to comment on one of the previous reviews. First of all, ""The Days of the Phoenix"" isn't a hidden track and it's not an Offsring song, it was written by Davey Havok. For that matter ""Totalimmortal,"" is not an Offspring song either. Another thing, don't call ""Very Proud of Ya"" the undisputed masterpiece. ""Undisputed""means that nobody disagrees and people STILL argue over that. The Art of Drowning is my personal favorite. Also, ""Black Sails in the Sunset"" has no racial messages and there is no swastica in the art. That would be your own paranoid conpiracy, and even if there were one Alan Forbes does the art, not the band. Idiot."
1,"Whatever you do, DO NOT buy this cd!!!","I was looking around at BestBuy and saw this cd on the rack. I thought, ""Wow! A tribute to AFI? That's awesome!"" I had never heard of these bands before so I was eager to take a listen. And well, it was a ""Great Disappointment."" When I heard the first song I thought, ""This is kinda bad. But maybe the rest of it wont be so bad."" And let me tell you, it was. I love AFI as much as the next guy does and I can see why you would want to buy this but please do yourself a favor. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT waste your money on this. The singers from these bands are horrible, at least when doing AFI covers. The singing was probably the worst part. I actually kinda liked the Mohawk song but her style of singing did not match what the song was trying to convey. So bottom line, horrible tribute album. DON'T BUY THIS CRAP!"
1,Ear Pollution,"Just hearing the samples makes me sick. I am a true AFI follower and I have every AFI album. These covers totally destroy the art and feeling behind the original songs. This is obviously a way to make money off AFI's recent success. This CD is made for mislead kids who saw AFI on t.v. and thought it would be ""cool"" to get this CD. Any true person who has ""A Fire Inside"" will not buy this CD. But that is only my opinon."
1,to bad there aren't less than 1 stars (-infinite stars),"OMFG WTF was that!!?? I listened to the samples on windows media player and I felt like I wanted to kill these artist, it is no small wonder these bands are underground, they probably have about 3 or 4 fans apiece they suck!!! And the chick/dude wutever from Weeb sound like a chipmunk or some god auful something. Ok I'm dun ranting if you even think about throwing a PENNY away for this Davey, Jade, Adam and Hunter should kill you!!!!!!!!PS- any1 no where i can buy AFI's Wieght of Words CD with 25 rare B-sides??? much apreciated-i'm out"
1,What is wrong with these people?,"..........I think that I might cry, from ...my ears bleeding from this crap. This is horrible, and if someone really wanted to make a good cover CD...I wouldn't suggest doing it with some crappy bands. Don't waste your money, this is trash."
1,terrible,"this makes me want to puke. the best song is the total immortal, and that's only because she's the only singer who gets close to Davey's excellent high vocals(she's a girl) this is the worst covers album i've ever heard"
1,Crap Crap and more Crap,This is insulting to all of AFI's fans...and to them. It was just bad. Don't spend your money on this.
1,horrrible,"i dont think that these bands could have done a worse job covering these songs. It is the worst thing i have ever heard, I am not saying that they are not talented bands but this is a horrible cd."
2,What are they doing????,"Davey Havock is the best song writer ever! Why skrew up their flow? That's just messed up. AFI is great, and outstanding how they are now. They don't need a tribute cd to them that's super stupid and just skrews up the perfect songs that they used to be when they were original. AFI is the best band ever. Don't make their songs sound bad by reduing them. AFI is unexplainabley good, don't skrew with them by reduing their songs, and makeing them suck!"
2,Models with dildoes,"If you need a photo essay of beautiful models masturbating with dildoes, then this is your book. Some quite strange-looking dildoes too. This little tome could have been really so much better. In the introduction, the photographer notes that he only asked the models to be ""insolent and indecent"" in their poses. His instruction was indeed heeded. My own taste in photographic figure studies is ""artistic nudes"" who reflect some class, so this one goes back to Amazon. To each their own."
5,Spur Of the Moment,"I never even heard of Spontaneous before hearing this album. And once I heard the album, I knew I needed to go get it. This is definetely one of the best underground rap albums and I recommend everyone go out and get this CD. Almost all the songs are good and you can play the CD over and over and never get sick of it. A great debut and I'm still waiting for some new Spontane."
5,"""Baby, This Collection is the Greatest!""","Without a Doubt the Ultimate Honeymooners Collection! A Must Have for the Die Hard Fan. No Matter how Many times you watch these 39 Classic Episodes,you'll Laugh out Loud Everytime. This is For Sure the Best Money I Ever Spent. Video and Audio Quality is Awesome. This Collection is Highly Recommended! And Away We Go!......"
5,Finally !!!!!!!!!!,"I haven't seen it yet but I ordered it the moment I heard about it. These were released on laser disk years ago, (I have half the set), and the quality was very good. I suspect these will be good also. I can't wait!"
3,Docked for lack of restoration,"Here is absolutely classic tv comedy, but what a lousy video transfer Viacom has given us - muddy audio, scratched prints etc., as have been noted by other reviewers. Instead of simply using these (probably 1980s) video transfers to make a quick buck, CBS/Viacom should have dumped them and given us new digitally restored versions created from original film elements (should they survive... they do, don't they? Please say they do.)"
5,honeymooners,If you honeymooner fan this is a must gleason and art carney were a great team still love watching it after all these years even if it black and white
5,"No Question, This is the Set to get First...","Not sure why I need to add yet another 5-star review to this set, but I'm a long time fan of the Honeymooners, and this is simply a must-have for any Honeymooners fan. Great quality-- some reviewers complained a bit about the audio on the first episode, which I agree is a little bit weak, but I consider the problem relatively minor. Otherwise the transfers are crisp, menus are nice, packaging is compact-- I just wish the ""lost episodes"" sets were given this kind of treatment.Now, when are they going to start releasing the entirety of the Jackie Gleason Show? Anxiously awaiting that one-- Poor Soul, Reginald Van Gleason, Joe the Bartender, etc... And Away We Go....Reviewed for Amazon."
4,Honeymooners Fan In Heaven!,"As a Honeymooners fan for as long as I can remember I've also been upset when our local tv station (WPIX/New York)first took the show off the air and then moved it to some awful time period in the middle of the night. I also made a tape from the Marathon a few years ago and combined with the commercials the video quality was awful. What a surprise when I had lunch with my old friend, and 'Mooner buddy, David Hirsch who mentioned he had heard CBS/Paramount was planning on releasing the ""Original 39"" on DVD. I went home...did a bit of searching and found not only Amazon had it but had the best price on the internet.I was so excited when it arrived a couple of weeks later...5 discs containing all 39 shows. My only sticking poing (which is why I only gave it 4 stars) why couldn't they also include some more material additional material?Trust me...I'm not complaining...I'm in Heaven!"
3,Good but......,"Just started watching this classic 39 set. Great fun, but the transfers leave a lot to be desired (and I am only halfway through disc 1 so far) When this series was shown on the BBC in the 80s the prints used were pristine. Some of the prints here are awful (the final part of ""Sleepwalker"" is horrible quality), the sound on ""TV or Not TV"" is set so low I have to turn the volume up on my TV to 70+ to hear itproperly. From my memory the laserdisc box sets were, like the BBC airings, very good."
5,"Fun, fun",I got this for my wife for Christmas last year and we both love it. We've enjoyed them very much.
5,I Loved it! A Classic to be treasured for sure.,"Good, Clean, Wholesome and funny, a real LOL Funny. It brought back so many memories. A Classic to be treasured for sure."
5,Funny! Love it!,I still can't believe TV Guide ranked Seinfeld as number one comedy and placed this one number two. I don't care what anyone says this was number one. Jackie Gleason was so funny and wasn't above using anything to make us laugh and that included using his weight. I can watch this collection over and over again especially when late night TV gets boring or they choose to show silly shows like Friends that hardly make me laugh at all. Give me Ralph and Alice Norton and Trixie anyday. These actors live on in this series and deservedly so. Get this collection!A.M Torres Author of Love Child
5,AWESOME!!,"One of my all time favorite shows. Now that I have this set, I don't have to wait and pray for the networks to put it on. The sound and picture quality is superb! I'll be laughing to these for the rest of my life.A must have for any Honeymooners fan!"
5,honeymooners of the 50's,"This was done live every Saturday night in the fifties and is wonderful. Brought back good old memories of live tv and hilarious at the same time. Gleason, Carney and the ladies the best there was."
5,Best single season of television ever,"No review is needed. Buy it ,watch it, love it.""Official space helmet on Captain Video""."
5,Art Carney is the true genius here,"Gleason's characterization of Ralph Kramden is too over the top to me. I don't find anything lovable about Ralph and Gleason's bellowing is over-the-top. Art Carney is the true genius here. Norton's repertoire of body movements is like a ballet. Carney's timing is flawless. His Norton is sympathetic, lovable, hilarious, and great physical comedy.What about this set?The transfers are excellent. I have never seen this show as clearly as it is in this set.There are no extras. That's a pity because there are plenty of celebrity admirers of this show who would love to have contributed their two cents. Phil Hendrie is one of them.The episodes are out of order and grouped by themes. This something that should NEVER be done in a box set. Purists buy box sets. And they don't want any tampering with holy writ.The comedy still holds up. This is a great series."
3,"DVD Quality Laughable, but Great Episodes","The good : all 39 Honeymooners episodes in one collection. The bad : Nothing really done DVD wise to enhance the show. TV or Not TV epsisode has the sound problem, but take a look at the ""LULU"" Norton Sleepwalking episode. The last 7 minutes of that looks like it was extracted from a silent movie. The makers of this DVD set did nothing to enhance the show technically, but pretty much gave you VHS copies on dvd.Only saving grace of this collection : The HOneymooners is a great show and it's nice to have all the classic 39 in one set."
5,"""Hello Ball""","If you recognize that line and which episode it's from than you need no convincing. The Honeymooners is classic TV at it's best. The 39 episodes here are the most familiar , particularly to those of us who stayed up until 11:30 PM every night for years to watch them in syndication on WPIX in New York.WPIX ran the Odd Couple and the Honeymooners back to back and it was absolutely addictive. The Honeymooners has spawned numerous imitations....Kramer on Seinfeld is an updated version of Norton..think about how he enters the room each time....The Honeymooners in addition to being funny appeals to the nostalgic sentiment of anyone who grew up in the 50's and 60's in NY. Everything about it reminds me of my lost youth.Great set to own. I replaced my numerous VHS tapes with ths one boxed set....can't miss."
5,Epitome of classic 50s TV,This is a great set of DVDs. The content is everything you would expect: hilarious classic TV entertainment. The transfer from the old film technology to DVD is superb other than an apparent loss of volume on some episodes. Add this one to your collection! It's the greatest!
4,To the moon!,"I paid $12 for 39 episodes of television history; I would have paid twice that just to see the one with Jackie Gleason on rollerskates. If you have even the slightest sense of humor, you will enjoy these videos."
5,Greatest commedian of all time,"Greatest comedian of all time. Actually would read script once, then would drink and party all week while rest of cast rehearsed alone, then would walk in night of show and just do the show. Expressions, gestures made up as he went....script from memory. Man was nonpareil."
5,Excellent! (AVP),"All the wonderful episodes are here. It's hard to pick out a favorite. Watching this DVD brings back happy memories of watching these hilarious episodes with my mother, father and 4 sisters. The sound and picture are A-1. It arrived early and in excellent condition. This DVD is a must-have. I would absolutely recommend this seller to anyone."
5,Honeymooners Classic Episodes,The quality of old black and white recorded on DVD exceeded my expectation. The episodes are great and keep us laughing whenever we view one. Great family entertainment.
5,Quality presentation for quality comedy,"When I purchased the Classic 39, I estimate I had already seen each episode at least several dozen times. However, like fine pieces of music that you never grow tired of hearing, these classics can be viewed again and again even when you know what's coming next. (In fact, anticipating the next line from a character is part of the fun.)As for the quality of the transfer from the originals to DVD, it appears flawless to me. Both the audio and video are clear and the viewer can sit back and simply enjoy."
2,Annoying format,"I bought this for my dad and thought there'd be an option to ""play all"" or something of the sort. Instead, you have to manually select each episode to watch it, and then wait through the entire into every time!! So if you want to sit down with some pals and watch it straight through, better stick to those old VHS tapes you made when they were playing them on a marathon and you could cut out the intros, etc."
5,The Honeymooners - Classic 39 Episodes (1955),"I bought these as a gift for my grandmother. Lots of laughs and memories for her; this one my grandfathers favorite show. If you don't know Jackie Gleason's character in this, Ralph Cramdon is a cranky guy that is always trying to get rich quick. He is a NYC bus driver and lives a a tiny apartment with a funny neighbor side-kick Ed Norton that works in the sewer. Crazy comedy back then."
4,Good clear video and sound,All the episodes are clear and sound good. This pack is exactly as it is stated. I would like more special features as I am a fan of this old series. But this is definately worth the money.
5,"""Am I coming throught out there?""","I love this box set. For under $40.00 and no shipping how can you complain? The Honeymooners is the best comedy ever made and you won't be disapointed with this set.. Make it a nice gift for yourself and your family this hoilday season.Rest in Peace Mr. Art CarneyRX,"
3,"Wonderful episodes, bad DVDs","We were totally excited when we ordered this set, but when we tried to watch, not so excited. The programs are wonderful--the ones we were able to watch.Picture this, Ralph opens his mouth to say, ""Humma, humma, humma"" and not even one humma comes out. When you finally get the episode working again you are past the line, but grateful the disc is working again.One of the discs would not play at all and two had places where the program stopped and it would take five minutes to start it up again.The Honeymooners was a wonderful program and we have spent many evenings watching the classic episodes, sometimes laughing ourselves silly. We just wish we could have seen them all.Here's our problem, we love The Honeymooners. But we would like a set that actually works. If we return this one, can we exchange it for another that actually works?"
3,Christmas Gift,"I have not heard from the recipient of this gift, other than he was delighted just to have this set."
1,Now it comes out. Bumf Bumf! Had to fill in rate???,"For the past like 7-8 months from the Columbia house club,every month I've been receiving the classic Honeymoonters episodes from Columbia house club at $25 each. Thinking that it will never come out on DVD, I decided to take the plunge and whatever it costs, it's worth it to have these classic episodes.When CBS had the Honeymooners 50th Anniversary special on tv, the clips that they took from the classic 39 episodes were all digitally-remastered. I have a friend who works there and he told me. But I remember you can definitely see the difference.Why in the world didn't they digitally restore it. I don't get it. So charge a little bit more. jeez. I also have the vhs boxed special which I only watched some episodes and is in excellent condition if anybody is interested. But the DVD's that I have from Columbia House could swear are in excellent condition.My 2 cents worth. Rejoice Honeymooners fans!!!"
1,THIS WAS NO HONEYMOON!,I was very disappointed because the DVDs were damaged and could not be viewed AND this was given by me as a Christmas gift! The replacement was also received damaged. No more Amazon DVDs for me.
5,The Greatest!,"Now I can watch any episode I want any time, not when the networks decide it's time to bring this show back.Hiliarious! Good quality.Highly recommend!"
5,Strongly recommended.,I recommend this strongly. Great authentic kung fu action. The story line is kind of confusing and you don't put it all together until after the final battle. Subtle impersonations of Bruce lee are in the movie as well.
4,Mostly I like it,"Mostly I like this frame. It is good looking,well laid out and has inputs for the common flash memory types including xd and a regular usb input for flash memory modules. The picture is good at normal viewing angles, the 800 by 600 screen a very big plus, and it handles 640 by 480 videos fine. I think these are the basics for a good ""frame"".The sound, which is not crucial to me is not very good. You do have to reduce the size of large jpg files to something more moderate or the slide show feature will slow down a lot. The remote is not intuitive.Despite these drawbacks, which I regard as relatively minor, I think this is a nice frame and a very good value."
5,Rich,I bought this item for my wife. She absolutely loves it. I researched as many digital frames as I could. This is one of the better ones. The clarity is extremely sharp. I have a 7.3 megapixel camera because I love clarity. This frame gives you that.
3,"Very good picture quality, but","Picture quality is very good. But, I have tried 3 different Coby digital frames and the SD card reader on the Coby frames cannot read any of my SD cards. I have tried multiple cards, but they cannot read any of them. The same SD card works in my camera, other digital frame and even in this Coby frame if I put it in an SD card reader and attach it to the USB port of the Coby frame. This is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. BTW, I don't use the video, or the sound so I can not speak for that. I only use it as a picture frame."
2,Good but still needs work,It says on the box that it plays most mp4 and avi formats.. What a joke. All videos I tried to put on it did NOT work at all or the sound was really off. I was really upset by that. The picture quality is good and the sound (when it works) is nice as well. It also generates alot of heat for such a little device but oh well.
3,2000 photos max,"Its best to resize your photos before loading them onto the card (max screen resolution of the Coby DP-882 is 800x600). According to other reviews, they look better when resized before loading rather than letting the unit do it. This also lets you load more photos onto the card. But, although you can load thousands of photos onto a 1 Gb card, the unit only displays the first 2000 photos that it finds. This does not seem to be documented anywhere.[[ASIN:B000MFG43A Coby DP-882 8-Inch Digital Photo Frame with Built-In MP3 Player]"
3,Digital Photo Frame: Ok but...,"I gave it to my mom and she was fascinated with it. Great resolution and options overall. The remote control is a must! Although, as I was explaining to her how to use it, everytime I would go into the music files, it would not go back (menu) and I had to turn it off and back on in order to see the pictures. Also, when playing videos with audio, it seems out of frame - either the audio plays after the video or before."
1,MMC Warning,"The rating of 1 is simply due to the >$40 price. This frame is fine at $40. More than that and you would be better buying newer technology digital frames. Amazon prices can, and do, fluctuate wildly. Although posted at >$100 as of this review, I have purchased it at $40 in the last two weeks.This frame is outdated: it will NOT accept the new SDHC (high capacity) MMC cards and Coby has no firmware upgrades to do so."
4,Gifts,Bought two for Christmas gifts and they were big hits. We loaded pictures on them and then wrapped so when they were opened they already had photos on them. Great Gift
5,Excellent High Quality Easy to use !,This is a great product. it has a great viewing angle and woks well showing clear high quality images. I would buy it again in a heartbeat and the price of 115 was good. I shopped around a lot before purchasing.
4,Looks good,"The first one I got would not power on. Amazon was amazing, they sent for it and replaced it within 5 days. That one worked very nicely. The units have trouble with flash drives if they been formated into two drives. Keep with the cheap memory sticks and enjoy the pictures."
5,If you want to save money...,"...in photo labs you must buy this, it works great, I have it in my office at work and its really cool!"
1,bad digital photo frame,As soon as I received this item I charged it for a approximately 10 hours.It worked maybe three four times and then it wouldn't turn on.
5,The best song on the face of earth! I love it ! A must have!,"Since I am a huge,huge,huge,HUGE fan of the WB,i totally fell in love with this song the first time I heard it earlier this year.Wow! it is just such a great song I cant put into words what I feel! you've gotta try this album! i've already got it and i still go on the WB11 web site just to watch the video like,say,at least 10 times a day! this cd rox!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
