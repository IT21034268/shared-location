3,containers with torn seals,"this is the second time I purchased this product. I had no problems the first time, however this time although the siz pack box was sealed, 3 of the individual containers had torn seals."
4,Entertaining.,"I've never read the comics, but consider myself a fan of the character. I picked up the movie for a chance to see Lady Death in a different medium. The animation was very good, coming from the same producer as Batman: The Animated Series, but this DVD is not intended for small children. They were careful to stay true to the character's comic book origins, while still offering an original take. Die-hard comic fans probably won't approve, but this is an excellent straight-to-DVD production for the mainstream. The story could've been more fleshed out, but that leaves room for improvement on [possible] future releases."
3,Eh...,"It did nothing for me.I'm a fan of the comic from back in the day, but this movie fell short for me.The animation was weak - way weak compared to today's standards. It reminded me of the animation for the Spawn Animated series that was on HBO in the late 90s.The voice acting was okay, but the sound quality wasn't all there.The story was fun, but the ""big"" fight scenes could've had a little more punch, and not seemed so one sided.I don't hate, I don't love it."
3,Lady Death's Movie,"I was inmpressed with the animation and detail. The storyline was good, but not all together based on the comicbook story line, but good none the less."
1,MISLED,"oh man what a big waste of money, horrible movie, i gave it a chance and definately came away painfully dissapointed. if you like cartoons, especially He-man then you might like this. for those of you who'd rather watch inuyasha or DBZ or real anime like neon-genesis, you too will be disgusted..."
3,Disappointment,"When I first saw previews of this film, my expectations of it shot through the roof. I thought it was going to be the greatest thing since Jesus. It wasn't a huge disappointment, but they could have done so much more w/ the film."
1,Lifeless,Dissapointing and dull. What is it about animated films and shows being done in the states that makes them all so bad? This one of the worst films I have ever seen. And the sad thing is it probably didn't have to be. The comics (which I have never read) may in fact be quite good I am imagining...I can see the character having some complexity if properly approached and fleshed out...Here you just don't care. What a waste.
2,Could've been better,"To start with, I don't know why this is called ""anime"", this was not made by the Japanese. The movie has potential to be good, but it has too much unnecessary dialog with lots of cheese and the animation is below average."
1,Deceiving Packaging for a poor film,I just finished watching this movie and I can honestly say I am truly dissapointed. I am not very fussy with animation as I am a big fan of the genre but I highly doubt this will remain in my collection. The cover art is soooooo good you just can't wait to get home and watch it but the animation is actually very poor (for a motion picture) and lacks that detail and shading you enjoy in most anime's. It is of the quality of your saturday morning cartoons (I have seen some with better). I also found a lot of the action sequences very repetitive. The story moves too fast and you feel no connection with any of the characters introduced. This is a real shame as I can see potential in these characters.In regard to the dvd the sound and picture quality are fine and it has a couple of extra's.In conclusion don't waste your money unless it's super cheap!! You will enjoy Vampire Hunter D or the short film Blood much much more than this.
4,An Extended Handbook to Microsoft Office.,"EXPLORING MICROSOFT OFFICE 2003 VOLUME 1 is a textbook that is basically an extended handbook on Microsoft Office. The book has what I would consider six major sections: basics of Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, the Internet and the world wide web, and some essential computing concepts. The sections dealing with Windows, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint contain all kinds of helpful hands-on exercises. The Internet and essential computing concepts sections don't have quite as many exercises and contain a little more book rather than hands-on knowledge. To be completely honest, this book is rather boring to read and work through on one's own. However, when used in conjuncture with a class, it makes a great tool."
1,Exploring Office 2007,"I received the wrong product from the customer. I requested 2003 and he sent 2007. Very unhappy, not a good experience with Amazon.com"
1,Code had been used,the code for the online class had been used. luckily the instructer provided a free one out of sympathy
5,Now I Hear the Answers,I bought this book because it was recommended by my audiologist that I see yearly for my check-ups. I mentioned my grandson who is still having hearing issues but still passed every hearing test. It did not make sense to me. The doc said it sounded like an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD.) She said the book was written in layman terms and was an easy informed read. She was right! We (parents too)were able to match his behaviors to the disorders explained in the book. This was such a discovery!The case studies that are in the book gave me the feeling someone had been peeking in our windows. My daughter cried when she read it and we have scheduled an evaluation for APD for my grandson. Buy the book. I bought it gently used and it was well worth its weight in gold.
5,I Knew Her When...,"I have known Teri Bellis for nearly 19 years, ever since we were graduate students in Santa Barbara in the mid-80s. She was a brilliant scholar and incredibly well-rounded person even then. Reading this book demonstrated for me that this remains true. Her writing style is at once lucid and almost literary. When I was recently enrolled in a doctoral program in audiology, I had the good fortune of taking a couple of courses in the area of CAPD (or APD, or whatever acronym applies). Teri's research and writings factored heavily into the mix. She managed to generate in me an ongoing interest in this rather nebulous area of study. This book for the masses should do the same for the layperson. I heartily recommend it."
3,Good but lacks documentation,"Although this book was helpful, I have concerns because there is very limited source documentation for the research. Where is this information coming from and how can I find the original sources? I know ""When the Brain Can't Hear"" is written for parents, but it would be helpful for parents to know where to get more information. I was surprised that there wasn't a list of Works Cited--not a good indicator for a research based book such as this. In several places Dr. Bellis states, ""The research shows..."" but fails to say where to find the research."
1,"Yes, the movie is as shallow and brainless as it looks, awful.","I am flat out ashamed that I have even seen this movie. National Lampoons has really lent their name to so many bad projects recently, scaring a great legacy. This DVD is just bad. Yes, expectations were low, but Come on, I thought it might have a story or some humor. Nope, just Nikki Ziering half naked periodically throughout the movie to capture the dumb male viewer (forced to include myself now), and a bunch of film of idiot College kids getting drunk. After half way, I just hit fast forward, but it didn't make it any better. And the story they tried with the two loosers in vegas...not funny. I am left ashamed of seeing this. Avoid at all cost. Don't even waste the time to rent it."
4,Spring Break,I found this movie to be funny since I like National Lampoon's type of humor. I would recommend the movie at an affordable price.
2,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ***,"This is such a boring game ! It doesn't have too many clothes to choose from and not too many colors and designs ! If you want to buy a Barbie CD-ROM , buy Barbie Pet Rescue !"
3,Mediocre at best,"I enjoyed reading this work, but I still think it is mediocre. The characters and dialogue were wonderful, but I found the relations and the society to be superficial. I felt the matriachial elements were forced in and the love was mostly told and not shown. The most emotional part was the death of Yuri while I felt the love stories amounted to little. And also I feel Yuri was there for too short of a time for the reader to develop a strong relationship with him. The author seems to have just created him to kill him off and make it a non-cliche book where one of the main characters dies. Elements of the society seemed to come into play just so Tess could observe them and seemed unreal. The love was fluid unlike real life (usually)."
4,Barbie as Rapunzel??,"Well, I was skeptical at first, but my daughter is in LOVE with anything that is Barbie so I bought the DVD and the vid game... She watches the movie about 4 times a week, but the game is played pretty much as long as the computer is on!...So... Long story short, the game is rather 'old school' in game play and graphics, but very simple colourful for children... It's a fantastic game with puzzles and dialog that any Barbie fan will love."
5,More on Fruits Bsaket,"I was hooked the moment I got the first disk. it really is an amazing anime full of romance, fighting, and some bonks on the head. if you want an anime that is funny, has some action, and a little bit of every catogorie (crap, did i spell that right?)in it Fruits Basket is the one for you. I highly recomend it to anyone who likes a good laugh."
5,Sweet,"The second Fruits Basket disc is probably the sweetest one of the three that are out so far. More of the Soma's history is shown, and more of the family's intricacies as well. The bonds between the characters are all strengthened and characterization is reinforced. Just more fun cuteness from Fruits Basket!"
4,Straight to the heart,"Fruits Basket is an anime that you watch with a girlfriend. It's warm, fuzzy, and pink, and it knows this. Not saying it's a bad series, it's very nicely drawn and animated. The story draws you in, and the characters are interesting. The soundtrack is lilting and sweet. Heavily episodic though, there is some character growth, but Honda Tohru is in many ways a flat character, making profound changes upon the lives of others though. It's a good series, one that I would recommend, especially if you want to get your girlfriend into anime."
2,Cheaply Made Poker Table,"This table is made of plastic, and has a very small felt surface with no cushion to it. It doesn't work any better than a standard folding table. The quality of workmanship is poor. The latch to close after folding up is not very well made, and doesn't stay closed. This table folds up nicely for transport, but is quite heavy to carry."
4,"Great value for the dollar, not exactly a professional's table","For what I paid, this table rocks! However, it is very light and unless you put it on carpet, the table will slide all over your floor anytime somebody bumps it even lightly. Still, great purchase."
3,Good for the price,"This table is excellent for the price. It's big enough to hold 8 people comfortably but small enough not to take alot of space. I have to admit that after folding it a few times the clasp to keep it folded isn't the best but for the price, i will leave with it."
4,"great construction, a little snug for 8 players","this thing could survive anuclear attack. heavy as heck, but it rolls nicely on its casters. the gaming area is a bit on the smaller side, but it still works well enough. it is a bit snug for 8 players to fit at at once, but 6 players fit nicely. definatly a great addition to game night in the garage."
5,Six stars out of five! WOW!!!,"If you haven't seen the movie, WHY haven't you? I'm a 35 year-old production assistant and boy are my arms tired... but seriously...This soundtrack replaced Donna Summer in my mind as the soundtrack to my soul. I highly recommend this, but you already knew that.Many times my mom has asked me to turn to ""TURN THAT NOISE DOWN!"" but I can't help myself! As soon as I move out of her basement, I might just listen to this soundtrack 24/7. That's 24 hours a day, seven days a week (for those of you who aren't in the know)."
5,Buy it for the Shapero,"The Shapero Symphony is the reason to buy this cd. Previn's version may be much better recorded and somewhat better played, but Bernstein's interpretation brings greater committment and sparkle. The Shapero symphony deserves to be much better known than it is (and not just due to the surpassingly beautiful second movement). Highly recommended."
3,just buy the dvd,"It's nice that amazon has made this available for streaming,but it can already be found on dvd, & usually cheaper than the streaming price.Frosty's Winter Wonderland/Twas the Night Before Christmas"
3,Standard Tshirt,"Took a little longer than I thought it should have to arrive, but decent standard tshirt. I would order one size up, I find it runs small especially after washing."
4,Excellent,"Now that we know ""John Blackthorn"" is Gary Hart - I am not surprised it was so good! Few know Hart the novelist. This book is an excellent read concerning issues so vital put into a context of intrigue and suspense. Also check out ""I, Che Guevera"" (using the Blackthorn psuedo)and ""Strategies of Zeus"" written under his own name - AND - ""The Double Man"" written with William Cohen. This book again proves Hart was a man ahead of his time and had the potential for great leadership - not to mention a great moonlighting job as a writer of novels!"
1,Garage to Glory? Wouldn't know if never made it out of the garage!,"Do not buy this game unless you are sure that your machine will be able to play it. Although I was able to install it without a problem, when running the game itself nothing is rendered. About the only thing I was able to do with the game is listen to the sound. The game makers have no knowledge nor were able to help me with my problem. If you think you will have better luck then go right ahead and buy the game, but I recommend that you don't."
2,"Great Mandolinist, but Not a Great Teacher",I'm an intermediate mandolin player and this DVD is pretty hard to use as a learning tool. It's clearly hard for someone of Sam Bush's talent to effectively break down what comes to him so naturally.This DVD is mostly a rambling discussion/Q&A; between Sam and an offscreen director that needs better organization and a better over-arching plan to be considered really instructional. It's basically Sam Bush talking about whatever comes into his head and a lot of time is wasted with just talking and not teaching. He's not a natural teacher and he jumps around all over the place not finishing many of his thoughts or topics. He doesn't provide any systematic way for the average player to really approach rhythm mandolin.
4,Compelling,"This magical work, under the baton of Bernstein, most certainly stands as a tribute to the conductor himself. It IS true, his conducting makes a work ""come to life"" in a way that you've never heard before. However, this being my favorite symphony, I always have a snag with the final movement, as the brass section is given triple-tonguing, and SELDOM get all the notes. Many conductors try to ""cover up"" this danger spot by bringing up the snares, but it still can't fool me. There is only ONE recording I've found, with perfect triple-tonguing, completely through from the brass. I would love to recommend it to you, but the volitaty of this work's many recordings, make it out of print. However, if you have no bone to pick this will probably sit upon your favorite conductors AND symphony list."
4,"This ""feels"" like Scheherezade actually telling her stories","Many do not like Bernstein because of the dramatization he placed in the NYPO recordings. For a piece such as this, that drama brings out the real story behind the orchestration - Scheherezade entertaining her master, and thus saving her life, with wonderful stories."
2,imitation of Mary,"The book itself had some very good points in it, but I also found some heresies that make it impossible to read the entire book."
4,The Miracle Match- Gerard Butler,I really liked this movie and I'm glad that I purchased the DVD. I will watch it time and again- it's a very uplifting story. Gerard Butler looks like Cary Grant in this movie- yummy!
3,"Worth the buy, I think...","If you want a movie that has a whole american feel about it, I guess you must also have a little love for sports movies as well. I really liked the comadere in this movie a long with the fact that the first american team was made up of italian's germans, but not full blood americans.I really liked the movie I loved how family-like the team was and how the emotions switched when the leader of the Italian team realized what it was all about and how the team wasn't 100% serious at first. It is a realtime movie about a team that really comes together and how they have to fight to prove themsleves among the best of the best in soccer. It has a league of thier own feel to it so if you liked that, you'll love this one!"
2,pretty good,"not as great as i thought, but still a good movie. did like some of the soccer scenes but thought there should have been more game action."
4,Great movie!,"The Miracle Match is a good movie for families. A true story of the 1950 U.S. Soccer team that overcame great odds. It was partially filmed in St. Louis, Missouri and Brazil. Great actors! I bought this movie and all of my friends and family that I have shared it with have enjoyed it."
5,Where is the @#$% DVD,"For the last 3 months everyday I went to Blockbuster and asked if they knew when this movie was coming on DVD and they said they never heard of it. So I go online today to amazon.com to see if there's a release date and there isn't?!So let me get this straight, every week at every video store a B-movie that doesn't even make it in the theaters comes in on shelf and this movie isn't even coming?! I knew there was an anti-soccer attitude in America but this is pathetic!"
3,"Good, but not Great","I am a rabid fan of Gerard Butler, but even I can't give this film a glowing recommendation. I'm even from St. Louis, where some of the filming was done. Most of the team featured in the film was also from St. Louis.It's a good film, but just not great."
2,Disappointing soccer movie,"Now I know why even during a World Cup this movie didn't make the big screen. It is a poor attempt to replicate greats like Chariots of Fire, The Natural & Victory. If you liked those movies, pick one and watch it again instead of this one. There is no character development here, most of the soccer scenes are terrible, and we don't learn anything about what occurs after the game v. England to the players. This was fertile soil wasted."
1,Boring movie,"I bought this movie for my 13-year-old son who has been a soccer player for eight years thinking he would enjoy it. It was so boring we couldn't even finish watching it. There is not much soccer play and to much revolves around the ""old timey"" characters. It is a real snoozer."
1,This film is a joke!,"This movie is sooo ridiculous! It's interesting to note that only the gamethe U.S. was able to win at that 1950 World Cup is the main focus of thefilm. The accomplishment of the United States is much less fantastic ifit's taken into account that the U.S. lost the rest of their matches aftergetting lucky enough to defeat England in that one game. After defeating England, the U.S. still was eliminated in the first round of that World Cup. And Joe Gaetjens, the man who scored the only goal for the U.S. in that game, wasn't even an American citizen!"
2,Political nonsense!,"I'm a police officer for a local agency in California, and this book was mandatory reading for the sergeants test. I've heard from other officers that this book was nonsense, but I approached the book with an open mind and read it anyways.It was a very tough read for me, because it was just a bunch of war stories about the author telling the reader how awesome he is.There are a lot of good things in the book that I agreed with. However these practices have been done in law enforcement before Jack Maple was even a police officer, and he steals the credit for these accomplishments.Because this is the latest trend in law enforcement, every politician and police administrator must have this book. But in short, just use the word ""Community Policeing"" in your grant writing, and your agency will get the money."
2,Kinda fun,This game is not really fun. The movies that you make are kinda like slide shows. You also don't get many characters and the game only works on really old computers.
2,I wanted to like it...,"This game is horrible. It rarely works, the scences stop, it locks up, the charecters go all weird - plus you certainly cannont make anything close to a sensible movie with this. You can't make the settings move, do cloeups, make charecters talk, or add any drama or action to your film. You can't make the charecters move in any way other than walking. If you want to make a reasonably good filmmaker that has no problems and you can make a anywhere near realistic film, this is NOT the game your looking for."
2,Soggy Stories Hit The Stands---Story Maker Barbie,"I thought this game was ok. Just crossed my boarder line between bad and a little good. This game allows you to do all of the stories you want to create, but usuing barbie's themes, characters and props and... settings. Her features are quite complicated. I would give this game a 2 because some parts were really hard to under stand."
3,Cool....................,"I liked the game when my parents got it for me, but it's not the BEST game in the entire world......It's fun, but sometimes it dosen't work very well.....I recommend it though, because it IS fun, but sometimes you can get very frustrated because you can't get something to work!!! So that's why I give it 3 stars. Fun, but FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES!!"
4,"Very entertaining, but also very basic.","I liked the idea of this game, I mean, it is really, really fun, but you dont have very many characters, backgrounds, and objects to choose from, so you end up making the same thing over and over again. And plus, sometimes the game freezes or screws up and you lose your whole story. I always have a hard time editing because it always freezes up. So, I give it 3-4 stars. Fun, but too basic."
2,barbie story maker,i chose 2 stars because it will not tell me any where how to edit and then i can not make the movie i am very mad
4,Oldie but goodie,"I've had this tape for about 4 years now and I still use it. When the tape is done, I feel like I got a complete workout. I usually put more bounce into my step so that it is a harder workout. The steps are easy but again, you can make it as easy or hard as you want. I'd recommend this tape as a starter to an exercise video collection."
2,BORING!!!,"This video does get your heart rate up and requires you to exert a lot of energy, but the moves are REALLY boring and VERY repetitive. This is one of those videos that will end up collecting dust on my bookcase."
1,There are better... this one is really dated.,"I was tempted into buying this because of a number of positive reviews. I have a few older Austin videos that I enjoy, so don't think that I'm opposed to using those. I'm not. I found myself getting very impatient with Denise, as the warm-up seemed to drag on, and the stretches were very dated. More current videos seem to be so much more effective. The workout itself is longer than many of her tapes, but again, it didn't impress me as being very motivating. I do like her 30 Minute Fat Burning workout(1989), and the Fit and Fat Free(1991) tapes. They're a lighter workout that remind me of the aerobics classes of the late '80s, but are a nice change from the tapes of today."
5,Great Gershwin,"For someone who is looking for a Gershwin collection that contains something other than the usual pieces, this CD is sure to please. Here is a generous collection of original recordings dating back to Al Jolson's 1919 rendition of Swanee. There are dozens of other recordings from the 1920's and 30's. Most are of Gershwin's Broadway songs. The 2-CD set also includes Gershwin himself playing, among other pieces, the Andante from Rhapsody in Blue and the Three Preludes. Robert Russell Bennett's Porgy and Bess-A Symphonic Picture is here in the 1945 world-premier recording by Fritz Reiner and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Overall, this is an outstanding bargain for anyone who loves Gershwin."
4,Worth the money,"I just got this from Amazon a few days ago and have already watched it twice. It's that good; you find new things to laugh at each viewing.I have to admit I was bit cautious in ordering this, as Ron White has a tendency to do the same act over and over again (in fact, his THEY CALL ME TATER SALAD DVD is just his act here coupled with his act from the first BLUE COLLAR COMEDY TOUR). This was a bit of a surprise.It starts similar to the first BLUE COLLAR DVD, with the boys relaxing. However it's all show after that. I have to admit, i do miss the interludes of the first movie, but I can see how they don't want to beat a dead horse.I recommend this one, if you enjoyed the first one. If you didn't, don't look to this to change your mind. Nothing sophisticated here; it's just good ol' boys having fun. And watching them have fun is more fun than being thrown out of a bar in NYC or having your nipple bitten off by a beaver."
4,I believe that.....,"If you like to say the word ""gidderdun"" more than 400 times in a 2 minute conversation, than this movie is for you."
3,First was better,"I thought what mostly brought this movie down was ron white. he was hilarious in the first but seemed just pathetic in this one and repeated alot of from the first movie. Engval was moderatly funny, but he always is, he wasnt bad. Foxworthy was great and Larry as always had me rolling. If you're a die hard blue collar fan this is nice but not at all as funny as the first.still happy i got it though."
5,Red-state hilarity at its very finest,"Pay no attention to those coastal elitist comedians discussing the quality of airline food (as if the Concorde is going to make a stop at the Lower Appalachian Regional Airport) or sharing anecdotes about waiting ""on line"" at the bagel shop, all the while sniggeringly mocking the moral values of the residents of red states such as my native Virginia. No, here you'll get biting, rip-roaring comedy involving such true-life situations as the food at the Trailways station or being pinned under the tractor for the fourth time in a week. Of special note is Jeff Foxworthy's new ""You might be a patriot if..."" routine, which extolls the virtues of votin', prayin' and bombin' sandy countries."
4,Lots of laughs!,"Just watched this last night with the neighbors. We were laughing hard the majority of the time. Ron White's part seemed a bit tired, but was still very enjoyable. I really liked the opening bit in the bus.I would have liked to see a couple of ""extras"" added in though. Or even some stuff from the guys being out on the town goofing off. (just to break things up a little)A really fun time though! ""I believe....."" (to quote the guys)"
4,Just as good as the first,"I think that this movie was just as good as the first one. Though this one doesn't have the extras that the first one had, it has better stand-up than in the first one. Heck, if this movie didn't have good stand-up, it wouldn't even get close to comparing with the first movie. Overall, this movie was awesome!GIT-R-DONE!"
5,funny guys,"If you haven't heard or seen them, then you're missing a wetting your pants in the humor of it all. They are funny fromt he gitgo, but they grow on you lick a bad relative that you love to laugh with."
3,Blah,"A few funny moments, but mostly just video of previous CD bits from all four. If you have the CDs, expect even less than ""Blue Collar TV""."
5,ANTHOR ONE!!!!???????,WHOA! Anthor Blue Collar Comedy Tour!!!! YE YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!
3,Tired Humour,"I was rather excited to watch this comedy but was soon discouraged after the first few minutes went by. For anyone who has followed any of the guys they will soon realize that their skits are almost the same as the the first tour. Then the guys came out with their own DVD's. So I also rented those. Much to my dismay, the were also the same. Don't get me wrong though. It is extremely funny, and the guys work great together, but, the material is starting to wear. When I saw the Blue Collar tour for the first time I nearly peed myself. I thought it was awesome. Then I saw the individuals separately, still funny. The second tour, just a little repetitive."
2,TOO LARGE,These panties were way too large. The smallest size offered was size 5 which has been my size for all my adult life. When I measured by holding these panties up to my usual brand they were 2 inches larger all round. I am returning them.'
3,sized much smaller than normal,"Quality of product was good, I liked the feel and stretch level. My complaint is that they were sized MUCH smaller than other Vanity Fair panties.MT"
1,Vanity unfair,Have bought these before and have loved the feel of them and they wore really well. This pair lasted one whole day before a seam came undone and then caused the nylon to tear. Boo on this pair
1,Don't waste your money,"I chose one star because it says Vanity Fair brief...but when I got the brief it had no tag whatsoever for size...make. My opinion is it probably should've been in ""seconds"" but ended up online at Amazon. There is no stretch at all, was too small although I ordered 1 size larger just ""in case"" it ran small. Was wasted money for me because it isn't worth the shipping cost back to Amazon."
2,Runs way too big,"I ordered according to the Vanity Fair sizing chart linked from the product page and I received the size I ordered, but the item runs about 2-3 sizes too large. The size chart is wrong. I can't even wear them they're so big."
5,New Penguin Dictionary of Music,"This brilliant update of an old favorite is the new ""bible"" in basic musicology. All music students and lovers of music should own it ! Great value for money at just over $20.00 as well."
3,Elitist attitude,"This book is mis-titled. It should read Dictionary of Western Classical Music, for this is what it is about.Other types of music are mentioned in passing or ignored. The tone of this book is that classical music is superior. This said, it does serve as a comprehensive ready reference to western classical music. Note: if you have the 4th ed. 1977 by Arthur Jacobs, keep it, for it has some entries that are not in the Paul Griffiths edition."
3,Sing-along songs,"The video is done quite good. But the Audio quality needs improvement. I have similar Audio CDs from Disney (Children's Favorite Songs - 4 Volumes), if I have to compare the quality of the Audio it's no where close to Disney's audio CDs."
3,Not suitable for families with children,"The base is lightweight making the lamp easy to topple over. The table holds up to 1 lb. I got this lamp because I remember my parents having a lamp like this when I was young and I liked it, but was disappointed mainly by the base-it just isn't sturdy enough to hold the weight of the overall lamp. What I do like about it is the swing arm-yet that also wobbles the base when the arm is moved. I would not recommend this product."
4,Good Floor Lamp,"This Floor Lamp looks stylish. And the base is stable. Only issue I have is the light we get from it. If you need bright light, then you might buy some other Lamp, just like me."
5,Great Lamp for a Great Price,This lamp was perfectly priced and a snap to assemble. It looks great and fits in those tiny spots where you need light but don't have the room for a table.
1,Doesn't work,"Ordered floor lamp to use for reading in our new living room. The switch does not work, it works only on one level. This is the second lamp (same kind) I ordered. The first one was the same thing worked only on one level, 50W. We need it brighter to read. We tried to send it back but I cannot get apart."
2,Let Their Be Light,"We wanted an inexpensive reading lamp that would sit quietly next to a living room chair without fuss or muss. The lamp was fairly easy to assemble. I did not appreciate the sticky label that was attached to the top of the little circular table because the glue left a sticky residue that I have not been able to remove with ordinary cleaners. Aside from that problem, the lamp works."
3,okay,Good lamp. Only let down is that there were two stickers on the top of the table that damaged the finish.
3,"Servicable, not great","Traditional Floor Lamp with Attached TableThe overall quality of this lamp is good, for the price. A few things were less than satisfactory, though. The table is quite small, and looks cheap. The linen shade arrived with a black smudge, which I have not yet attempted to remove; I'm trying to decide on the best method. The table had cautionary stickers on it, which, when carefully peeled off, left a glue residue. A soak with rubbing alcohol failed to remove the unsightly marks, although the stickiness of the glue was removed. I plan on trying some other methods, but, I think those stickers should have been attached differently.The Styrofoam packaging had been damaged in transit, and resulted in a mess of small Styrofoam balls all over my apartment. Keep your vacuum cleaner handy when unpacking this item."
3,yeast package was old,I have tried these bread mixes before but this time the yeast package was old and the bread did not rise like it should.
5,Bread mixes turn out great!,"This variety of bread mixes was great for a little wedding gift. I made a basket with flavored butters, butter spreaders, and these mixes. I received rave reviews!"
5,Another no holds barred view of the world,"Although written in a kinder spirit than Paul Theroux's book; The Happy Isles of Oceana,Paddling the Pacific, this is a great account of someone traveling what is quite possibly the hardest area in the world to travel and understand. Criss crossing the Equator as best as he can, impeded only by geopoilitical obstacles and impassible section, he manages to pretty much circumnavigate the globe. And as my favorite writter paul Theroux has pointed out, he finds some very nasty areas along with the occassional jewels. Great travel book."
4,POETRY IN MOTION...THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE ROPE...,"Lyrically written, the author, Gaston Rebuffat, one of the world's climbing greats, expresses such joy for mountaineering that it is infectious. No climbing enthusiast's library should be without this book. Rebuffat is positively poetic in his description of various climbs. The reader almost feels as if one were as one with the mountain. A purist, the author climbed not for the glory of it, but for the sheer joy of the brotherhood of the rope. In these days, where climbing is often just a reason for a media event, the author's approach is refreshing, indeed."

4,Perfect for my little ballerinas,"I was looking for a Tchaikovsky cd for my little girls, 5 and 2, who love The Nutcracker ballet. They absolutely love this cd. Also, this has been a great way to introduce Swan Lake to them. They seem to love it as well. Of course, they also love Sleeping Beauty. My next purchase will be The Nutcracker in it's entirety. As great as this is for my ballerinas, I miss the other music from the ballet that wasn't included in this cd. The cd arrived on time."
4,"Good for compact digi cam or video cam, but not for DSLR","I got this one for Canon Rebel Xti and video cam. It is a small compact tripod very convenient to transport.First, if you are looking for a tripod to work with DSLR, I would not recommend this one. This is not built for DSLR. It worked fine with Canon Rebel XTi with kit lens or Canon EF 50mm 1.8 II. But when I attach EF 28-135mm with filter and hood, the head does not stay still.Now I use it for a small video camera, and it works great. It is small and light enough to carry it pretty much anywhere."
2,A lil flimsy,"Its a OK tripod, it can handle the weight of my D5000 and short light lenes. But with my Tokina the ballhead will slowly drift downward. I returned it after 2 weeks and had to pay for shipping. The legs are a lil flimsy extended. When fully closed you can remove the upper piece for better storage...kinda big for a small tripod imo"
3,Intended use should be clarified.,"The intended use should be cleared up for this product. It is made for lightweight point-and-click cameras only. I purchased this hoping it would be sufficient for a camcorder. It's not.When fully extended this product is far too unstable to support the weight of any decent sized camcorder.The product is very light weight and compact, however. If hiking or traveling this product would be very convenient. I recommend not attaching anything to this tripod that is of any significant value to you...it will soon fall over if it weighs more than 1 kg."
5,Great Little Tripod,"I had been looking for a quick-to-set-up tripod that was short enough when collapsed to fit into my motorcycle's side case (saddlebag), and that yet would have the bells and whistles I desired, like a removable camera base that would enable one to switch cameras easily on the tripod, flip-open & closed leg locks to enable quick set-up and take down, a reasonable height when fully extended, and full head adjustability for doing pan, portrait, panorama, and angled camera shots. This little tripod has proved to have it all, including being very well and sturdily constructed. Duplicate head connectors can be had so one can put and leave one on each camera one wishes to use, and can thereby switch cameras with nothing more than the pull of a lever at the tripod's head. Yet these are, as is the tripod, well made and compact. The tripod is furthermore, anything but flimsy, despite it's small size. I'd call it rugged!"
4,Good tripod for travel.,"The best thing about this tripod is its size and weight. Once collapsed, I can easily fit it into my camera bag(Canon 200EG). It can lie flat in most backpack as well so it's definitely ideal for travel.Quality build and solid legs are definitely a plus. The height of the tripod could be an issue for most people. The load capacity is not great but usable for a Canon Rebel XTi with a 28mm-105mm lens. You might have to push hard on the grip to lock it real good. XTi with the 70-300mm lens is definitely too heavy for this tripod, in that case, I use it as a monopod. The vertical column(when fully extended) does not lock very well sometime mostly due to camera weight, I'm sure point and shoot and camcorder shouldn't have problem like this. I expect all this problem when I purchase the tripod given the size and load capacity and at this price, it's a good tripod to have for travel."
1,leg clamp broke after first use,one of the hard plastic clamp they use for the telescoping legs broke. on the top section! i had to do a quick fix by wrapping it with hard wire to close it permanently which makes the product not so portable anymore.
5,Brilliant!,When I pack to travel I pack light. I have not seen a plug adapter that is as compact and adaptable as the APC. I have not yet encountered a plug it won't work with. I can carry TWO of these in the same space that most other adapters require for one.
5,A true traveller's friend,"A very useful, practical e simple product to use.Even smaller than other similar offers on the market."
5,GREAT FALL COLOR,Love the fall color this nail polish provides. You do need to put on 2 coats in order to have it completely opaque. The color is very striking and awesome for autumn
4,Like it,"This color is great for the fall and winter months. Spruces up your dull nails with a deep, rich color."
4,Not the color shown!!!!!!!,"Great polish as always with OPI, but the color shown is not accurate. It's acutally a deep maroon. Pretty though."
5,love it,"great nail polish , this and china glaze r the only polishes that go on my nails , yes , i am spoiled"
3,Much brighter in person,"I bought this polish expecting a rich navy color, but in actuality it's more of a ""smurf"" blue. It's also got a sort of pearly quality to it. Not a terrible thing, but not what I was looking for. I'm saving it for summer, hoping that it will make for a cute pedicure."
4,Love OPI products!,This is my favorite nail polish brand. Its a great color that goes on super smooth. The brush has been updated from years past and seems to apply much nicer and stays for a long time without chipping.
2,Soft gloves but poor fit and not warm,"I was disappointed with the poor fit and the lack of warmth these gloves provided.I selected the large size, which is normal for my hand. The four fingers fit just fine but the thumb is way too long. I have a normal hand and other gloves fit me fine... maybe I just got an off pair.These are NOT met for any sort of cold weather. The leather is thing and the lining is sparse. Good for weather in the 40-50F range.Overall im disapointed. The chinese made leather gloves I ordered off amazon are warmer even though they lack the cashmere lining."
4,"Nice price, good fit","I was a little wary of buying these gloves, but it turned out they fit nicely, were very supple and the quality of the leather was very good."
2,A dissapointment,I bought these gloves as a Christmas present based on all of the good reviews. The recipient and myself were disappointed. The quality is great but they are short - they barely come to the wrist. I will be returning them.
4,Very easy program,This program has a very easy to use interface that anyone can learn. If you need to inventory your card collection this is the program you need. I highly recommend it.
3,Asterix the Legionary,The comic book I purchased was translated by a Robert Caron in the 1990s. I much preferred the version translated by Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge in the 1970s. The newer translation is nowhere near as funny as the older one. I wish they had never tampered with the original English translation.
5,book purchase,"As always with Amazon, I received the book I ordered very quickly, in perfect condition and reasonably priced."
1,"Looks like a great little faucet, but doesn't fit my sink","This review is for Amazon's listing not for the faucet since I couldn't really use it.I just bought a house with an old 1950's era sink in one bathroom: it's a great sink, but the chrome faucet & handles are horribly pitted & corroded, so I wanted to replace them. I found what I thought was perfect for my classic sink: this Kohler cross-handled faucet. The price is also very good: much less than the hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars needed to buy wall mounted designer faucets.But, the description doesn't list the width of the faucet stems: they are only 5.5 inches apart. This 5.5 in. center is far less than the 8 inch center i need.Faucet looks great, but I can't use it so, I'm sending it back.Alicia"
1,Incorrect product description,"This faucet set was described as a wallmount 8"" spread faucet with pop-up. The actual spread was 5.5"", so it had to be returned delaying the project."
4,New Insights,"While all six essays in this slender volume will prove of interest to the reader seeking more background on J.R.R. Tolkien's epic story, I found the essay by Janet Blumberg, ""The Literary Background of The Lord of the Rings"" especially valuable. Prof. Blumberg not only explains the influences of Anglo-Saxon literature such as ""Beowulf"" and High Medieval literature such as ""Sir Gawain and the Green knight"" on elements in LOTR, but also offers a credible explanation for one of the most remarked about elements in the books: the absence of any overt religious practice or worship. This essay alone makes this slender volume a valuable addition to the library of any Tolkien fan."
4,Good but needs expansion,"This is a vey good book but perhaps too focussed on Christian values for the title to be fully correct. Hal Colebatch's ""Return of the Heroes: The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Harry Potter and Social Conflict,"" which I have reviewed on its own page, does a much more comprehensive job in looking at the relationship between TLOTR and the whole of Western as well as specifically Christian values. Both, however, are full of interest and recommended."
2,Lackluster mystery,"I've enjoyed Mitchell's earlier Mrs. Bradley books, but was very disappointed in this. It's a rambling, not-very-sensible mystery and oddly written in some parts. The Holmes-themed party occurs early on and is not really that important. And I never did figure out all that rigamarole about the Hound. Not recommended for general mystery lovers or those who enjoy a Mrs. Bradley story."
4,Great lost 90's alternative rock band,"So many great bands got lost in the shuffle of the mid/late ninties. Bands would get signed, then make a record or two, then poof. Gwen Mars, along with Flowerhead are my favorite lost groups of the 90's. This CD simply rocks like early Smashing Pumkins, and has some really cool vocals. Its great."
3,Not bad,"Bought this for a friend, we busted it out as soon as I gave it to him, had some problems at first, but we had never set up our own hookah before. Hit pretty good once we figured it all out."
4,Great so far,I bought this frame for my mother in law for mothers day. She has 4 grandchildren (so far) and not one more available place in her house for more pictures so I figured this was perfect. I also bought a 2GB SD card so she wouldn't have to worry about running out of room. I loaded the pics onto the card and pluged it into the frame and viola! The picture is nice and the ease of the plug and play is great for grandparents. I have not tried the video or music and doubt they ever will. For what I bought it for it's great. The slide show mode is nice and you can change how fast it flips through the photos. We're happy with it and thinking of getting another one for the other grandma.
4,dedicated to booksellers and book readers everywhere,"filled with insight and photos: the contents include Mr.Galsworthy's secret loyalties,the kingdom of Conrad,a great critical on joseph c. lincoln's novels of cape cod.this is a book that will walk you thru the best of 1923 and it is the best entertainment on books you are likely to find anywhere. A rare and wonderful look into the past,with interest and wit..."
4,Provides a realistic overview of the country,"This video follows the main railroad line that runs North-South down the middle of Tunisia. In so doing, it provides an interesting glimpse at the lives of the people, the economy, and the Punic and Roman ruins that dot the landscape (Carthage among others). It's a pleasant program, intelligently narrated.There are two problems with the video: (1) it begins with an unattractive couple singing a folk song about railroads (Hit Fast Forward as soon as it comes on), and (2) the DVD itself is poorly produced, so that the controls on your player may not work (including Fast Forward).If you're thinking about taking a beach vacation in the country (Its beaches are very popular with Europeans, similar to Cancun with American), look elsewhere. This program totally bypasses the beaches.For further information on Tunis and Tunisia, DK has an excellent guidebokTunisia (EYEWITNESS TRAVEL GUIDE)"
1,Not the Arrangements from the Recordings !,none of the slick Claus Ogerman Chord progressions or Deodato for that matterGone is Jobim's scat on One Note Sambathis is just the standard sheet music
1,TERRIBLE! Do not waste your money on this book!,"I bought this book with the understanding that I would actually be able to learn and play the songs listed within it as they were originally recorded. Unfortunately, I came to find out that the featured arrangements are in fact COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the original recordings. At times, chord voicings were somewhat compatible with the record (as with the song ""Dindi""); however, many songs (e.g. ""The Girl from Ipanema,"" ""Baubles, Bangles, and Beads,"" etc.) clashed with the recordings entirely. This was extremely disheartening, and I sincerely hope that Hal-Leonard will come to do the right thing and revise this book so that they can actually sell what's advertised on the cover, as opposed to throwing bundling a number of erroneous arrangements put together by a seemingly tone-deaf individual. Until then however, the company will continue to con people out of their money through false representation of the product that they are selling. BUYER BEWARE!"
2,Not so great,This seemed like such a great idea. The concept is good but they are very cheaply made for the money that I paid and uncomfortable.
5,"Better than ""Rockets and Robots""","The Phenomenauts are an incredible live band, and this CD finally captures their energy, their great musicianship, and their excellent songwriting. While ""Rockets and Robots"" has many fine songs, the mixing is a bit weak on a few tracks, and it often feels like a (very good) demo. This CD kicks ass from the first second, all the way to the end. There are no filler tracks on Re-Entry, and the band sounds twice as good as they did on their first disc.If you like the Reverend Horton Heat, Man or Astroman, or high- energy rockabilly, then you will love this CD. The Phenomenauts break the rockabilly mold, then step on it, then launch it into low-earth orbit."
1,thin,cheap was very dissapointed will let my grandaughter play with it I guess. I know it was on sale and now I know why
3,Buyer be wary,"Yes, 5000 titles. Yes, 5000 titles that any aspiring erudite ought to have on their shelf, if not already under their belt. But..... This is quantity over quality. What's the use of a database this size if it is not exquisitly indexed in a user friendly manner? If you're going to market a piece of soft ware to people who love books, why wouldn't you format the software for people who love books? I certainly don't regret the purchase, I'm just disappointed."
2,The Future is not looking very good,"Save your money and go to the internet to get full text editions of any of these stories. While convenient to have in one place, I have easily found many of these texts on line. While you will hear a few poems rehersed, the selection is not half of what it should be. The multi-media section consists of only a few of the texts included in this software.The search engine is nice, it allows you to search by era, nationality, type, etc. But this small bell and whistle isn't worth the price."
1,Total ripoff,"When you first install the program, you must install it to a folders with less than 8 characters in length. (No C:\Program Files\LOTF4) Tech support has no remedies and is of little help. Beyond that, the quantity of works is as promised, but for you to access anything, you must work with the terrible interface. Standard CTRL+C CTRL+X commands won't allow you to copy the text you want into an external program. (Of all of the fonts I have, I can only choose from 7) You can only select as much as your screen displays and use an awkward Edit>Copy to Clipboard to get text into another program. When you finally read a text and are at the beginning or end of it, scrolling up or down will bring you to the previous or next text.I could have easily found all of the texts I wanted online, but opted to purchase this in hopes that I could access what I wanted in a relatively organized manner-- big mistake. I hope you don't make the same mistake..."
1,Impossible to install on some computers,"The Technical Assistance desk of AbleSoft says that this CD cannot be installed on some computers. The Technical Assistance person I spoke with did not specify which computers have this problem or what the problem is. Since my computer is new, has plenty of RAM, and a large hard drive, the capacity of my computer is not the problem. If you have a Dell computer proceed with caution or you may end up having to pay for return shipping like I did."
5,Blissfully simple...Please become available again,What more can I say.5000 good things to read.Simple no-frills interface.You can make the type-face larger to make it EASY to read and then just turn on the automatic scroll.Should Scribners or Amazon be worried about this? I don't think so. If I want to read Madame Bovary unplugged I'll get it at the bookstore or from Amazon. I'll buy as many books as ever.But this is so coooooool. Download these on-line? I don't think so!!! You have better things to do with your time and RAM memory than download War and Peace. Sheeeesh!I DON'T WANT E-BOOKS. I will never buy an e-book.I want this and when I want something else I want a nice little Scribners or something. Or when I want a Dan Brown I'll get that.But somebody's gotta bring this AbleSoft product back!!!!!I gave away my copy thinking I could buy another.PLEASE SOMEBODY!!!!I'd pay $$$.
3,Leaves much to be desired....,"**Spoiler alert**Ellen Campbell is very pregnant, & she's being stalked by an unknown shadow. Is she crazy? A case of pregnancy hormones getting the best of her? Or is she actually being watched by someone?This wasn't THAT bad of a read. It kept me entertained anyway. At the end, when the stalker was revealed, I was EXTREMELY disappointed on the stalker's identity. I think it would have made more sense if it had me her ""friend"" Vicky instead of the crabby Nurse Irene. Blah!This book had too many loose ends that were never explained in the end. I also thought the ending was anti-climatic & rushed.I hate being nit-picky about a book because I love them so much.It was entertaining to say the least & a good mystery. I was just highly disappointed with the ending."
5,Going to the core of Truth,"""The Texture Of Being"" points directly to the ineffability of ""what is."" It's a clear invitation to openly embrace your humanity in the light of who you really are ... deep down. Highly recommended.Chuck Hillig (author of Enlightenment for Beginners, The Way IT Is, Seeds for the Soul, The Magic King and Looking for God: Seeing the Whole in One)"
5,The Wedding: What a Great Way to Enter the World of Romance,"This was the first romance book I had ever read and I absolutely loved it. The setting was fantastic, Scotland is always a good place to set a novel. Also, you can't go wrong with the time period, 1100's. Brenna was wonderful as a fiesty heroine and Conner was equally as good as the stubborn Scottish laird. I definitely recommend it for first time romance readers. Then go on to Julie Garwood's other novels. They are just as good!"
4,Not Garwood's Best,"I have read most of Garwood's books and I admit that they are all very well written. The only thing that troubled me in this one was the weak heroine who later just turned inside out and became an almost complete snob. The plot was somewhat underdeveloped as well. All around, though, this is an enjoyable book, but definately not Garwood's best."
2,It was O.K.,"There was a time when I only read romance novels, but of late I seem to need much more to the stories, Every now and again I desire a good romance that I can sink my teeth into. This book was not it. May be I'm a little tired of the herione being 16 yrs. old, or the hero that is a brut, only to turn into a sad puppy dog by there one and only love. When all is said and done I'm in it for the history."
3,"A nice read, but...","If you are looking for a real romantic story to spend your time and money on, don't get this one. I personally found it really hard to finish. The beginning of the book started off really well, but by the middle (when Brenna meets Jamie and Alec), the story started to lack. There are some scenes which are utterly silly. The heroine, I believe, is very childish and immature, and that made it really hard for me to continue. If you want a really well-written novel by Julie Garwood, you should try The Secret, Ransom or Honor's Splendour. You will want to read those more than once."
3,"Great Concept, blah delivery......","After reading the reviews on this site, I was expecting an unforgetable tale. Unfortunately, I can list more cons than pros if you're going to read this book. Conner lacked a personality and rarely showed any affection toward his wife. Brenna & Conner barely spoke and when they did it was awkward. When Brenna wasn't with Conner, she reminded me of an annoying child rather than a woman.I didn't realize THE BRIDE was the first novel in the series. I would have much rather read about Alec and Jamie in THE BRIDE. They had more chemistry in the 5 pages they were mentioned than Conner & Brenna had in the entire book."
4,A medeival to cherish,"On her way to Scotland to marry her betrothed, Lady Brenna is kidnapped and forced to marry her bethrothed sworn enemy, Connor MacAlister.After agreeing to marry Connor, Brenna then vows to become the best wife possible, therefore making changes to Connor's home, trying to make him become a perfect husband and also capturing his heart.This was a great medeival that I truly enjoyed. Although, in my opinion, not as good as The Secret or Ransom, the story of Brenna and Connor should not be missed."
3,"It was a wonderful beginning, but...","I am a HUGE fan of Julie Garwood's and I was very excited when this book first came out, but, after reading it, I was a bit disappointed. Though the beginning was wonderful, the plot and the dialog after the first 3 or 4 chapters felt rushed and some scenes I felt needed elaboration. I got the sense that she was just churning out another story for the masses without putting as much soul into it as she has with many of her other novels."
5,A must read!,Julie Garwood keeps you enchanted from the first page. I started the book and couldn't put it down. Scotland at it's best
4,Almost perfect!!,"I love the book, but my favorite is still The Bride. The characters spent too much time in the forest and at Jamie's home and not enough time togther to get adjusted to one another, which is usually when the heroine tries to change her husband and the husband is too stubborn to let her. Ms. Garwood shows the cleverness of the woman by having her outwit her man, the hero often realizing too late that he has changed to please his wife. That's the best part of all of Ms. Garwood's book. Unlike McNaught's, there isn't too much heartache dragging the book down. In McNaught's books, I don't ever like the men and women seem too wimpy. In Ms. Garwood's books, the text is funny, the women spirited, and the men(oh dream)are hard but willing to bend. I especially love it when they are frustrated by their wives' antics and when they act so tough when loving them"
4,A review of Julie Garwood's The Wedding,"I have read The Wedding several times, it seems to be one of those books - though an easy read - that you can just relax and enjoy."
3,Unremarkable Highland Romance . . . in a long line of Highland romance,"The Wedding is the unremarkable story of Brenna and Connor, another Highland romance from Garwood. Yet if you're expecting a story of the same caliber as say, Ransom, keep looking.In a genre where the ending is a foregone conclusion, all we really have to look forward to is the path the hero and heroine take along the way. In the Wedding, the path is more like an interminable march along an indoor running track - no real emotional obstacles to overcome, no suspenseful villainous plot to really distract you, and the various chapters just seem to run together.I love Julie Garwood, although I appreciate her historical novels far more than her recent thrillers, but this is one Highland romance I'll gladly leave on the shelf. ""Its ok"" is the perfect way to describe this book."
4,"Excellent, but...","As with most of Julie Garwood's books, this is an entertaining and fast-paced read from cover to cover. The characters she creates are well-developed thoughout the story. Brenna is fiesty and spirited, but also has an endearing vulnerability to her. Connor's confusion at the intricacies of the female psyche had me laughing out loud.The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was because of the language. Being English, I'm a little pedantic when it comes to language - reading American words like 'quit' and 'sass' in a novel set in medieval England drives me mad, especially as we still don't use those words!"
5,Julie Garwood at her best!!!,"Once again Julie Garwood creates characters that stick with you long after the book ends. I continue to come back to this book time and time again to read the amazing love story of Brenna and Conner. In Brenna, Garwood has created a fiesty herione who is equal parts strength, caring, and humor. Conner is all that a highland laird should be - fierce, loyal, and protective of what he feels belongs to him; and when it comes to Brenna, it does not take long for Conner to recognize that her place is by his side. These loveable characters experience moments of great love and great heartache before they find their way together, forever. Great story line, wonderfully written scenes of love and angst, and an ending that will leave readers satsified and wishing for more!"
2,Very Boring,"This book was painful to read. I had to keep reminding myself that the characters were adults not adolescents. At the end of the book I still didn't know or understand what the feud was all about. The hero, Connor was believable for those days. I was able to relate to his point of view. But Lady Brenna .... She was an embarrassment. She was supposed to be so smart but I had to keep reminding myself how old she was. How boring.The story had a decent plot with the villain (Rein) ... I thought there would have been some good and tense confrontation between Connor, the stepmother and Rein to give substance to the feud. Nothing ... So boring"
5,The Wedding was WONDERFUL!,The Wedding is a great book. Readers will fall in love with the charming characters. I could not put it down. Humerous characters and a captivating plot will capture your imagination and your hearts.
1,Not my cup of tea !,Yuks. I tried to force myself to skim through it (lucky thing I borrowed this from the library otherwise I will be criticising 'louder') I don't like her too cutesy/dumb heroine..really get on my nerve. I find that her style is not my cup of tea. I tried another book of hers too (want to give her another chance in case she wrote that particular book on her off days) but the outcome is still the same - I hate it.
1,The worst Garwood ever,"I love Julie Garwood's style, but this is the last book I brought by her. It is the only one I've thrown away. I own all her others. I didn't find this one amusing beyond the start. There was nothing special about the characters. It was predictable and just a bit insipid."
5,I loved this book!,I love all of Ms.Garwood's book and must admit the newest always becomes my favorite. The Wedding was a great follow up to The Bride and I can only hope that the series will continue with Brenna's younger sister and Conlin's man-at-arms-soon.
4,Good parts..,There were a few moments where I just wanted to skip because it didn't go as fast as I wanted to but that's me I love cheesyness and so its ok in that department.
4,The Wedding,"Historical romances are known for buttering up the romance. I loved this book because it doesn't. Women were commodities. We were bought and sold for goats, cows, and pigs.But I don't completely blaime all the men of the time peroid cause it was a harsh time in our history. Connors fathers' demand of a young boy paints the true picture of the time. It was harsh. People died every day from little more than a cold or a splinter.I really love to study history and I love historical romances that toe the line."
1,One has to understand that this product is basically lactose and nothing else.,My wife makes me order homeopathic items but they do her not one fit of good. Honest. Save your money and eat well. Try something physical like yoga to feel better.
5,good review,I put this on my iPod nano and enjoy reviewing and relearning a language I studiend many years ago in college.
1,CDs are a rip off!!,"I live in europe and wanted to continue to improve my German. When the Cds arrived I quickly tried to play them on every device I own with no joy. Amazon or this company would not refund my purchase. Spent a lot of money for nothing, very disappointed!"
5,german in my car,I am very happy with the CD's for learning German in my car. The diction is clear. The pauses between words and phrases are comfortable.I have a college minor in german which has been in the back of my brain since 1976. I'm listening to the 2nd CD and delighted with the memories I am pulling up to consciousness.
4,Learn in your car German,"This is a good way to learn German. It is the way a child learns to speak. You hear the words, then learn sentences. It is still not an over night learning, you have to practice, but it does seem easier than the way I was thought in school. It is a very good refresher course."
3,Use only if you are dedicated,"I've tried to use these several times, but I just cannot seem to get into them. They put me to sleep on the road. I guess if you really were into learning, and supplemented the CDs with other material, especially written material, they would work, but I would not try to learn too much with these CDs alone."
3,Ohio Players Rule,"I really didn't expect much from this Album, especially when I found out (after I ordered it) that Sugarfoot isn't on it! I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to it though. It's still good music. (Billy Beck does a good job on the lead vocals. He can even get some of Sugar's snarl). It isn't classic Ohio Players funk but it is a good album for a group who's supposed to have been ""past their prime""."
2,Nice Album Cover Watered down Album,Album Covers kept on the Right path for the Players but the Music just kept taken a Beaten.Billy Beck is cool on certain songs&there are some moments here&there but Compared to there Hey Day this is like a Watered Down Version of the Band.some of the music is alright but there isn't any stand-out material.
3,Not too bad for the 80's.,"Although, this wasn't exactly the Ohio Players of the 70's, this was still a pretty respectable album. There were some hit and misses on this cd. The track ""Don't you know I Care"" sounds a bit like their 1974 song ""I want to be Free"" from the ""Fire"" album. I would say this album was the best Ohio Players recording of the 80's decade. One thing the group never lacked was having lovely women gracing the front cover of their albums. If you are a fan of this group, then this cd is worth having in your collection."
2,Funny Translation,The book has a very funny translation. We had to retranslatedevery page and sticked it over-Diem-Tu
3,English words don't make too much sense,"I like reading complete sentences to the baby to help him understand flow of sounds and language, but the words in the book don't make too much sense. Book is ok..."
1,broken,it burnt the bread when you put it for auto cook. it almost burned down my house. be careful. very unhappy
4,Need some underground Redman?,"This is the place. Ill at Will is Redman branching away from Def Jam (which he makes pretty clear on the second track, actually calling out Def Jam). Very stripped down beats, lots of freestyle rhymes, and Redman returns to his clever/hilarious lyrical roots (unlike Malpractice, where he seemed to substitute ""annoying"" for ""humorous""). This is worth it for Redman fans."
4,Red man is good rapper.,"Red man is good rapper. Good tracks are Redlite District,Yeah!,and I C Dead People. His albums 4 out of 5.tupac and Bigga are this cd."
4,REDMAN THE NO 1 RAPPER FOR 2004,REDMAN HAS PROOFED THAT HE IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE INDUSTRY.THIS MIXTPE IS PERFECTLY DONE FOR HIS NEXT LP.TRACKS LIKE SAGA CONTINUES AND I C DEAD PEOPLE ARE 5 OUT OF 5 ACCORDING TO THE PRODUCTION HE GOT ON THE CD. NO1 RAPPER FROM NEW JERSEY LAYS WEST COAST STYLE WITH SNOOP DOGG IN TRACK CALLED YEAH YEAH AND HIS FREESTYLES SEARCHING FOR BARNEY.BRICKS INTENTIONS AND BRICKS STAND UP.ALL IN ALL FULL MARKS FOR THE MIXTAPE GOOD MUSIC FOR DIE HARD REDMAN FANS.
1,Needs Truesync 1.0 or 1.5,"Intellisync for the Rex can only be installed after you install Truesync. This is in itself is not a problem except that the Rex 5 Pro now ships with TrueSync Plus 2.0.Intellisync will only install over TrueSync 1.0 or 1.5 (a call to their helpful technical support confirmed this).As such, I have been unable to install Intellisync and have therefore not found it to be a useful product."
4,"The CD was well put together and should take N. O.,La. up.","I really enjoyed the CD. You guys are off the hook. The new CD is available entitled ""Brass Vibes"" which is self produced and on their independent label JENJAZ Records. For those who enjoyed the first one, hold on to your hats because the horns and tuba on ""Brass Vibes"" will blow you away. If you don't have it your sleeping."
4,Sports and Religon,"Initially, I had my reservations about a book written about a religon; but Jeff Call does what few in his industry can, tie sports and religon together. In his book; Luke, his male lead refers to sports as the universal religon.Style, character development, and the descriptive narration are all as formidible as to be expected of a world-class novelist.Take a read, you wont be disappointed."
3,Can you say obvious and predictable?,"I read this book in a day. I had to get to the end, even though I knew EXACTLY what to expect. I thought this Call person tried way to hard. I thought the main character was split-personality. One minute he's rough and tumble and the next he's wearing a CTR ring. I realize we were meant to see how he was melting, but did anyone else think the scene with the missionaries (when he was getting his discussions) completely unrealistic? Who acts like a total idiot? He was acting like a clown, and if he was as cool as they tried to make him be, he would NOT act like that. I don't know, this whole book was just weird. Ok for lazy spring day reading, but that Call person should stick to writing articles."
1,Dull-ville,Blatant Mormon propaganda. Horribly written novel that doesn't deserve even one star. Childishly written with characters that lack any sort of depth or imagination. Completely predictable and entirely dull.... a sad waste of time.
1,"NY Wire screen rolls 48""","Purchased 4 rolls andf 3 out of 4 were damaged, boxes looked fine. On box had two different rolls in it one wrapped around the other that was damaged. Do Not Buy. Came from Ideal True Value Hardware thru amazon."
5,Terrific Soundtrack...The Expanded Score Is Longer & Better.,"This is an excellent soundtrack to a wonderful movie. Jerry Bruckheimer has done it again, with Hans Zimmer (Academy Award winner for ""The Lion King"") doing the music. My favourite tracks are: ""Rock House Jail,"" ""Hummel Gets The Rockets,"" ""In The Tunnels,"" ""Jade"" & ""The Chase."" The Expanded Score, which is not commercially available, is much better, as it's longer, providing for a more thrilling musical experience."
5,Another Moving Action Score from Hans Zimmer,"THE ROCK is a powerhouse of film scoring. I played it several times before I started to recognize the cues used in the film. I do not know how much is Zimmer's but the quieter and reflective parts of the score sound definitely like his style and I truly love them. He had this same effect in GLADIATOR, very moving."
5,Have this soundtrack recieved any awards?,"This is the best soundtrack I have ever heard. Everytime i listen to ""Hummell gets the rockets"" I almost start crying. It is just so beautiful. It's just a shame that more people don't know the beauty of this soundtrack (because they haven't heard it). By the way does anyone know if it has got any awards?"
2,Overrated!!!!,"After reading all of the overwhelmingly positive opinions posted here, I thought the soundtrack was going to be mind blowing, so I immediately went out and bought it, and to my surprise, it was really mediocre. There was no attention paid to subtlty, and the music just blasted at you for forty minutes or so. Also, everything was incredibly redundant. The same theme just plays over and over again. There was almost no contrast at all, and I just found the entire thing annoying. The overall melody is interesting for a few minutes but not for forty five minutes. If you want a really great soundtrack, get Dragonheart. It's infinitly better than this one."
5,Zimmer Strikes Again!,"You can always recognize Hans Zimmer's work. His blend of orchestra and synthesizers is AWESOME! ""The Rock"" soundtrack illustrates his pounding beats and soaring scores perfectly. I HIGHLY recommend this one!"
5,the rock is awesome,"not only is the movie one of the best ever made, the cd matches up to it. although theres no words its still a motivational, calming and relaxing cd. its awesome. a must get for anyone."
2,for zimmer not good at all,"a Zimmer fan?: buy Last Samurai, King Arthur, Tears of the Sun, Gladiator, Thin Red Line, and Beyond Rangoon first. They are all much better than this one. Zimmer seems to be at his best when he goes global (Africa or Asia). His heavy synth stuff (like The Rock and Crimson Tide) isn't nearly as good. Instead of buying this I wish I has bought a new Last Samurai to replace my badly scratched copy."
1,Not a good CD!,"Dutch: Wat een rommel CD, mijn oren vliegen er haast vanaf van ellende! Ben jij muf en heb je een blauwe badjas, bel dan snel!English! Not an good cd!"
5,Hans Zimmer - legend,"In the world of film music there are a number of fine composers but none can outshine the talent of Hans Zimmer. This is music at its best. Pure class. The Rock soundtrack in my view is his best work, powerful, emotional - a collection of tunes which you will never want to stop listening to."
5,A Listening Pleasure,"This is one of the finest soundtracks I have ever heard. For any fan of movie scores, this is a must have. Excellent CD!!"
4,Buy it for track #1,"I can't say I like tracks 2-8 much, but my God -- Track #1 is a soul-stirring, world-shattering piece of music. You will not fail to get goosebumps, shivers, etc. listening to it. Stunning."
5,THE BEST ACTION SOUNDTRACK EVER!,The Rock is a very good movie and so is its soundtrack. The music is very dramatic and you almost crawl in the sewers with Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage when you listen to this CD. I think the film wouldn't be what it is without this masterpiece of music.
5,"A ""must have"" soundtrack","This a great soundtrack. Definately my favourite. For those who liked Crimson Tide, this is a similar soundtrack but in has more of the pieces I liked from Crimson Tide. Granted it might not have the level of variety that some people want, but I think that to add in too many different pieces (like more of ""Jade"", which is nice on it's own) would have ruined the whole feel of the soundtrack. A first class soundtrack."
5,The Real Eve,"This book I regard as one of the great books I have read in my lifetime. If books are meant to inform, educate, entertain and open the doors of the mind, then this does it in spades.Nicely written, easily understood and the profound drawing together of scientific disciplines only a polymath could achieve."
3,Filter issue,This filter was recommended for the shop vac that I bought but when it came it did not fit the vac that I bought. It said right on it not for model #=== This really is an issue for amazon to check out and not the quality of the filter. They were very good about refunding my money
5,Love it,"Since I have a number of cats, I go thru filters like crazy. When I discovered there was one for my sweeper that could be washed and reused I immediately wanted to try it. Haven't tried washing yet but it works well."
5,Does the trick - Fits 8-galon Shop Vac,I purchased this for my Shop Vac 8 gallon and also purchased the Shop-Vac 9058500 Foam Sleeve . I was a bit tentative because I couldn't find the one that came with my Shop Vac. These worked perfectly for what I have. They seem to be universal. All I did was measure my old one and these were about the same size and works nicely.
5,no more dust,"while the foam sleeve stops large particulates from hitting the motor, this filter stops 95 percent of the dust from being blown back into the room. Makes clean-up much easier and accomplished in half the time"
1,Wrong Size,"Despite my best intentions and the wording of the ad, this was the wrong size for my vac. Had to send it back."
1,too big,"The description on this item could be much more complete, poor job on Amazons part. I have a 5.5hp unit and this filter is much too large. Still waiting for refund."
2,Review of Shop Vac 90304,"Because the item was not well enought discripted on url, I purchased the wrong item and it had to be returned.The process was handled very well and I quickly received the returned creditOverall with the exception of item one listen herein I was pleased with the purchased and will continue using Amazon.Hank Propp"
5,Great,This filter is an exact fit for my Shop-vac. Good build quality. I will be getting many more in the future.
5,Great Replacement,I have a 12 gallon shop vac with this same filter. This comes with a replacement retainer thing as well. Fit perfect and replaced my nasty old filter that stunk up the shop every time I used the vacuum. Easy-schmesy.
4,"Not a ""red-stripe"" filter","This filter is not a ""red-stripe"" filter for the older version of Shop-Vac's. But other than that, it looks to be of good quality."
5,Good price for a needed item!,"We realized our vacuum never had it's filter replaced, so we jumped on Amazon.com and found it to be cheap, and would get to us fast. Done! Happy. Works well."
2,Don't be FoOled,"This product is a scam. The pricing is right, and the goOd thing is that it comes with the DIY trays that mold to your teeth, but the Nite Wite doesn't work -at all-. I used it two times for an hour every time, because the box labeling says not to overuse it for more than that. I didn't notice any results whatsover. NONE of the times. I thought ""Maybe I should ignore what the box says and use it overnight like I read online"" So I did, only on my upper teeth. I woke up expecting to see my teeth whiter, but when I loOked in the mirror and compared my upper teeth with my lower teeth...DISAPPOINTMENT. They were BOTH the exact same shade. Plus, it gave me ALOT of sensitivity. Two days later and still I can't brush my teeth properly or drink cold water without my teeth hurting. Don't be foOled! I'm sure there are way better options out there. I thought this one was mine. I was wrong."
4,A bit long,Wonderful commentary but at 900 pages it is a little long for my personal taste in reading. wonderful insights though!
5,Great Product,"Great inexpensive way to add more visibility to your bike. Use care with the plastic fastener, they will not take much torque. Position the reflectors so that the fasteners prevent them from being pushed towards the rim. Centrifugal force pushes them towards the rim as the wheel rotates."
3,A shadow of the original,"Bad casting and lame performances make this version of the Kaufman and Hart play a tedious ordeal to watch.The Bette-Davis Monty Woolley 1941 film bubbles like pink champagne, while this made-for-TV effort is as sparkling as mud.Nathan Lane as Sheridan Whiteside, the insufferable man of letters who (supposedly) breaks his hip on the steps of an Ohio family's home, lacks Woolley's bite and authority as he barks out orders and makes cynical observations about the people around him.The color production will appeal to viewers who cannot abide black and white photography.2 1/2 of 5 stars."
1,nathan lane?,what am i the only human on earth who finds nathan lane about as interesting or talented as an old piece of grizzle?guess so.
4,Stage on DVD,"This is a marvelous recording of a wonderful stage performance. One drawback is that there are no extras and you have to wait until the very end of the performance to find out who the cast is (there is no indication on the box or any of the explanatory material aside from the two stars. But there is historical material, presumably from the original broadcast that appears as intermission feature."
2,Where's the Pepper???,"I bought these thinking that crushing the salt and pepper made more sense than grinding it. I have always had trouble with salt grinders. I thought this set had finally solved my problem. The salt grinder (crusher) works great. Crushes the salt fine and evenly distributes it. The pepper grinder (crusher), however, hardly works at all. It would take forever to dispense enough pepper at the table. Using it for preparation of food was impossible. Crushing pepper does not work - only salt. Hey William Bounds - how about a salt crusher and pepper grinder???"
2,Incredibly dissapointed!,"I love old scifi schlock but yes I'm going to ruin this for you, just so you don't plunk down the money! They used 'real' grasshoppers. Just composited them on. It has feel of ""Them"" but not the cool giant puppets, just lame composites of real grasshoppers. Nothing monstrous at all. Sigh."
4,LENARD MALTIN: PLEASE,"REALIZE THE MOVIES WORTH FOR ITSELF. AFTER ALL THIS IS COLD WAR CLASSIC. THE UNKNOWN FEAR HAS FINALLY HAS A FACE AND WINGS. STARTED FROM RADIATION TO CONCER THE STATES. BUT IN THIS ONE WE WIN, JUST AS IN THEM, IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA, DEDALY MANTIS, GIANT BEHOMEATH. THESE ARE A PART OF OUR FILM FOLKLORE. LET'S GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE. AFTER ALL HOW ELES CAN A PERSON PUT A FACE ON SOMETHING THAT THE GENERAL POPULATION DOES NOT UNDERSTAND. FILMS HAVE THE PULSE OF THE NATION....THE 50'S PULSE WAS RAGING. ALL AND ALL GOOD FARE."
2,So Bad its Good!,How could anyone recommend a film that stinks? Easy. Its a funny film! And the best part is - its not supposed to be funny. My favorite scene is when Peter Graves introduces his lab assistant as the man who had the unfortunte accident working with radiation. And hes still there working with the same radio active stuff! I laugh out loud every time I see it. Its really bad. The quality of the DVD is the best I've seen to date. Image did a good job. Watch for the giant grasshoper getting thrown on the blanket of a picnicing couple.
3,Good...but not great.,"This is probably my least favorite of the MST3K episodes to be released by Rhino. Best parts: some of the Peter Graves stuff, Mike & the Bots' unwilling look into the daily routine of the mads (My favorite part of this episode), and process shots are always funny (""Hey wait...that's a postcard!""). Worst parts: some of the Peter Graves stuff, long moments of nothing (I fall asleep every time!), and several bits that are only a little humorous (Peter Graves play by Crow).It's tough to be critical of my all-time favorite show. But BEGINNING is not on the ""Best of"" list. I figure they used up a lot of potential material for BEGINNING while watching Attack of the Giant Leeches, It Conquered The World, Attack of the Giant Geela Monster, Creeping Terror, and Earth VS the Spider.Still worth buying for fans. Just so you have it in your collection."
4,“You can’t drop an atom bomb on Chicago!”,"Beginning of the End is definitely one of the lesser efforts of the BIG bug genre; no one could ever accuse it of being a masterpiece. To put it succinctly, it is dreadful. It’s also a lot of fun, with some of the worst FX ever created. The dialog is atrocious, the acting limited, the plot has definitely been used often and better. The story is all talk and no action; most of the “horror” is hearsay. Not for one moment is Peter Graves believable as a doctor of whatever. Peggie Castle makes a peculiar reporter, obviously more concerned with fashion than sensible shoes. More an oddity than anything else, this movie’s best feature is just how awful it is. There’s almost a sense of genius in its ineptitude. I happily made it a part of my collection and have watched it on more than one occasion. It is a hoot. (This movie certainly harkens back to a time when people actually believed atomic power was the biggest boogeyman they had to fear.)"
3,Nature Gone Wild,Eradiated vegitables are fine food for mutating garden variety grasshoppers into a gigantic marauding insect militia that devours everthing in their path on there way to chicago
4,Giant grasshoppers crawling on the Wrigley building!!,"That says it all!! It just doesn't get any better or cheesier!! Yes, another must if you're a fan of this stuff!!"
4,good,It was really in good condition. The only thing I would have to say is that it was a little worn on the side. Other than that it was in good condition.
3,"They're big, they're hungry and they're hopping mad!","If you love classic science fiction, keep looking. However, if you love the early superbug pics with just a touch of unintentional comedy, this one's for you. Too bad they couldn't point that Praying Mantis toward Chicago."
4,"Mike, not Joel","BEWARE:This is not a Joel episode. It's a Mike.Nothing against Mike, just thought I would warn y'all. I bought it thinking it was a Joel (ditto for Wild World of Batwoman) because it listed Joel in the main credits and has a BIG GIANT PICTURE of Joel on the back. But it's a Mike."
4,"Moral: no radiation in the fridge, please","Ho hum. Yet another 1950s movie about the horrors of nuclear radiation, complete with rubber monsters and postcard (literally!) backdrops. It takes something special to make this movie palatable, and Mike and The Bots (M&TB) are it. What dedicated MSTie can't quote from memory Peter Graves' preachy final oration? (Well, I can't, for one. But I know it's there!)One of the best things about the MST series was its unrelentingly positive worldview. Even in the midst of cheap and obvious movies like this one, M&TB riff their little hearts out and come out winners. The host segment where Mike calls the Mads and uncovers their hidden secrets is one for the highlights reel. Alumni and friends of the University of Minnesota should particularly appreciate Crow's touching screenplay, 'Just Plain Peter: The U of M Years.'"
3,OK but not the best,"This is the first MST3K Rhino DVD that wasn't up to snuff. The sound quality was poor on my disk - either too quiet or too loud. Sometimes I could barely hear the 'bots. This might have been due to the quality of the original, it might have been due to carelessness during the transfer. I'd like to know if others have had the same sound problems. Carelessness was the reason Joel was pictured on the box of a Mike-hosted movie though. If the music played during the chapter selection screens sounds familiar it's because you've heard those tunes before, in ""Eegah!"" Five stars (always) for Mystery Science Theater, less for Rhino's presentation. - Charlie (MST3K #5535)"
2,One of my least favorite episodes...,"Look...to be fair, one man's BOTE is another man's ""Manos"". What I mean by that is some people may love this ep, but I personally didn't find it very funny and the movie is so bad that the sub-average riffing doesn't save it. The best lines that Mike & the robots make are when they speak for a character and add a line to something a person says. Unfortunately, the feature's horrible pacing, slow dialogue scenes, and atrocious acting are not enough, and it seems like the writers took a break on this one. Of course, even weak MST3K is better than pretty much any other show, but I must say this is certainly my least favorite episode from season 5 and at times feels like a Season 1 episode (the riffing is sparse and not really funny). If you are a newcomer and would like to see this show at it's best, get either ""Manos: Hands of Fate"" or ""Red Zone Cuba""."
5,Hard to find,GL4 is tough to find and is needed on all BMW bikes from about 1965 to 1985. Price was ok and shipping was good too.
4,Hard to find...,"My 1997 Nissan Maxima requires GL4 for the synchos. It is hard to find. I did't want to go Ford synthetic - concerned about leaks. In cooler weather the shifter seems to be a bit sluggish, but once it warms up everything is fine."
1,It's too short (small),My DX7630 camera does not start with this thing on it. So I have either to put it on after it started of to screw it just half -tight so that it has enough space to operate. I'd say it's unsatisfactory and I'll have to find the other solution.
1,the long weight,"Please tell me if I will ever receive this item.I have waited a month already. I am referring to the adapter for my dx7630. I have the lens but I cant use it without the adapter. Thanks in advance, Marvin"
3,Basic system administration introduction,"The book does a good job of introducing the main UNIX concepts such as filesystems, shells, processes, inodes, etc. It also covers TCP/IP basics, network security, a little bit of everything. The book's focus is mainly on system administration (although an introduction to shell script programming is given), so if you are looking for programming information, you won't find much here. And if you are looking for advanced topics, you would likely be better off getting a specialized book on whatever subject you are looking for: on many subjects the coverage in this book ends just ""when it gets interesting""."
2,Not too Great,"This book starts off with an advanced discussion of the basics of a Unix filesystem. It moves on to breifly cover shell scripts, networking, PPP, and administration. The ONLY subject this book covers in any extent is system administration, and if that's your topic of choice, you'd be best to look in more specific books.The main problem with this book is its not specific enough or easy enough for a new reader, and its too simplistic and, again, not specific enough for an advanced reader. The only type of reader who might get good information out of it is a broad-spectrum intermediate reader.In general, I would reccomend that anyone looking for a good *nix book look elsewhere."
3,"Less than $1, BS! S&H bleeds you","Less than a dollar, right, sure. I ordered 7 of these (the max allowed) and they charged me $34.93 for standard parcel-post (USPS) ""Shipping & Handling""! What a con. My total shipment from them was less than half a pound plus pkg.! This was part of many different items in my order, and my order did not detail the shipping charges individually until it was shipped. The upside is if the reviews are right (I have not received) I will have a good little keychain flashlight(s) for $5.68 each, total, still a very good value; so I will accept delivery anyway. But for those who only buy one or two, I wonder what they charged you."
5,AGREE,I agree with the other 5 star reviews. I've had one of these lights for about 6 months and love it. I will buy another one when this one I have gives out.
1,RIPOFF - AVOID!,"I had 30 of these in the cart for office gifts. The shipping and handling came up OVER [...] - that's right, in excess of One Hundred Seventy Dollars to ship a few little items. DDDisks is trying to bait you with a low price, then hose you with shipping and ""handling."" Don't fall for it. I did NOT order them - at least not from here."
4,Great blues and folk!,"This is my favorite of DVR's albums. His voice is at its gravelly best and he shows himself equally adept at blues, folk, ragtime, etc. Plus, it has one of the most beautiful love songs ever written, in my opinion: ""Another Time and Place."" Buy this version, which is superior to the remake he did on the ""From Another Time and Place"" album."
2,False advertising!,"This is a Koch made-in-China knock-off.Apparently there is no CM brand available anymore-Columbus McKinnon went bankrupt and sold off these logging tools to overseas manufacturing. Under no circumstances will you be getting a USA made product! If you need one of these balsa wood handled beauties,buy the lowest priced one,they're all similar quality...cheap!"
2,Columbus Mkinnon Lumber Jack from Aubuchon Hardware,"I order the Columbus McKinnon becuse it was American made and a friend has been using one for 15 years. What I recieved was a Koch Industries ""Made in China"" knock off. The bolts shipped with it were rusted together."
4,long time study of the effects of high intelligence,"Terman started his longitudinal study of 1000 extremely intelligent kids in the 1940's. He followed their development on regular intervals. The study shows that HIQ's are not - as the cliche's say - unhappy, unadapted people, but that they can be highly successful as well."
1,The WORST CASE known EVER in the cellular industry,"We manufacture and sell THOUSANDS of cases for cellphones. One of our good customers wanted us to locate a fitted leather case for the Sanyo 6600 and we got this one for him. Oh My God... What a piece of JUNK. No tucked corners, stamped and painted leather -IF THAT- threads falling apart, glue on the plastic vinyl. We have this case in hand and will be doing a ""BEWARE OF CRA&"" review for cellular phone products. The fact that Amazon allows this to be sold is JOKE. Keep posted for the VIDEO reviews to come soon."
5,Two different DVDs with the same Ekstine material,"If you pick DVD 'Billy Ekstine Sings/Dizzy Gillespie Swings' [also available here @Amazon], you'll find the same great video clips with Billy Ekstine and his extraordinary big band as in this DVD 'Swing Era'. This would lead you to buy any single one.However, there is an important difference between these DVDs: the first one offers Dizzy Gillespie as a bonus while this 'Swing Era' offers rare video clips by Andy Kirk, John Kirby, Tix Beneke, Johnny Long, Ozzie Nelson, and Johnny Messner with their own bands.All is brilliant material, important jazz docs.So that's a question of choice. I chose both even considering Gene Ammons really plays one track. Credit should be really given mainly to Frank Wess.'Swing Era' also offers a misplaced video clip with Bing Crosby, singing a slow ballad despite the DVD title.All in B/W - All Region"
5,Perfect book to jump start and maintain a running program,"I love the format of ""Running made easy"" it's modern, exciting and filled with practical advice and information that's fun to read and mostimportantly easy to apply. This is the first book on running that I really enjoyed reading and the only book I continually refer to. The book has a wealth of information on all aspects of running. The personal stories of other runners achievements were exactly what I needed to motivate me to start running again and with this book as a handy reference I trained for and succesfully completed my first marathon. I highly recommend this book to both existing runners and those considering taking up running."
3,Someone recommended this to me,"I am part of an on line running club and one person came on saying how this was a great book. I bought it pretty much that same day on line along with 3 other books on running.While the book may be a good idea for a new runner, if you can already go a mile or two, you can skip this one. It is strickly for beginners.If you are new at running, great book!"
3,"Nothing New, Typical","This book is OK, but is fairly typical ""ghost story"" material. There's a lot of books out there about discarnate entity communications, and this one has nothing new to offer and, in my opinion, is not all that interesting, unless maybe you've never read this kind of book before."
2,Product quality,"I actually had to order the part again because the motor made so much noise. Amazon sent a new one at no charge although they seemed to be reluctant becasuse more than a few days had passed. The part is warrantied for a year so I didn't understand that. Delco said that the seller was responsible. Also, I had to bear the second installation charge which in the end negated much of the benefit of having purchased from Amazon."
5,Outstanding Remix/Dance album,"Wow, this is great stuff. I can agree with critics who say Yoko is not a great singer, but she is a great artist, and these remixes produced by a wide variety of dance floor wizards really knock me out. If you like to dance, and the artists who created the remixes appeal, then get this album. Guaranteed to get you out on the floor! Open Your Box, indeed!"
1,"Master of Deception, maybe.","Leung Ting was never a 'closed door' disciple of Ip Man - far from it he was one of the last batch of students Ip man had in his lifetime. This book is full of unfinished bits and pieces, and is far from a 'bible' on Wing Chun. I purchased a copy years ago just to have a look at it when I could receive things at a wholesale price. I wasn't really impressed with the book overall. I met Leung Ting around 1990 and he seems more like a used car salesman than a Kung Fu Master. One of his former Technician level instructors left his organization and I was quite amazed at this. I asked him why, because there are so many very devoted Leung Ting followers - he told me the guy was all about money. I believe it. So in closing, I wouldn't spend my money on this book, it has too many incomplete pieces to it, it is full of self agrandization etc. That's my two cents."
5,An incredibly entertaining and suspenseful literary ride,An incredibly entertaining and suspenseful literary ride with a perfect balance of intense passages and laugh-out-loud moments.
3,Slow beginning,"I rated the first half of Night Vision three stars. It was slow with too many quirky characters, idiotic bumbling events and very little mystery. The last half was probably worth four stars. The plot starting coming together with lots of twists and turns and was fairly decent. I'll probably need to read another of Paul Levine's mysteries to decide if he's better than this novel."
3,Lots of Charachters,"This book is out there. It's got more than one killer, several different plot lines and MANY charachters. So much so, that they almost start to get confused with each other. Definately, not my favorite of the series, but still a very competent book. Hopefully you enjoy poetry, because there is a whole lot of it sparsed throughout this book. Sadly, I don't, and it almost took away from the story trying to decipher the meaning of the poetry. Good read though, just not one of my favorites."
1,One was enough...,"Just because he writes about Florida doesn't make him heir apparent to John D. MacDonald. And just because his character drives an old muscle car and philosophizes about the troubles enveloping the state of Florida now and in the future doesn't make him a Travis McGee. One was enough for me...no more. I'll go against the tide of great reviews he's getting, and look for another author to read.David"
2,Lightweight,"Fun to read--but after a couple of Levine books, they all read pretty much alike. A little more ""meat"" would help."
1,Blech,"Had high hopes for this shampoo, being a lap swimmer and liking to use natural products whenever possible. But no. This shampoo, used with the ""conditioner"" by the same maker, not only did not feel good in the shower but also left my hair stiff and frizzy with a straw-like texture. Truly the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever used."
1,YOU HAVE TO BE EINSTEIN TO MASTER THIS QUEST,This product is a waste...! My mother bought it for me and I haven't been able to figure it out yet. It's incredibly complicated and most of the files are missing...
4,For the creative mind!,My kids LOVED this software but have out grown it. They loved to figure out the puzzles and enjoyed the challenge the software gave them. It helped them to be creative and think outside the box. They learned to overcome by trying different approaches and LOVED the maps.
3,Light reading,"Cassie Bradley Wright had been adopted. She knew about the Bradley's family legend that said each female Bradley was to wear a certain nightgown on their twenty-fifth birthday and she would dream of her life long love. Being adopted, she never expected it to work for her. It had worked for her sister though.Ryan Lawford was a big time business man. When he brother and sister-in-law died, he was given custody of his two-year-old niece, Sasha. He found out that caring for a toddler was a nightmare! Then Cassie entered the door! She had a natural way with kids. Ryan immediately hired her as Sasha's nanny! The two adults were perfect for each other, though neither admitted it. Yet Sasha would unknowingly show the two what love really was!This one is just a sweet romance. No life threatening times. No danger. No heartbreak. Just a slow blooming romance story. A nice story for lazy evenings in front of the fireplace."
5,"classy, well built",These lamps are really heavy. They look antique. At least as good as the image online.A really nice touch to my home!
5,a very nice lamp,very sturdy...simple to put together..gives off perfect light with all 3 settings...perfect height...shade allows good light source without too much brightness..a very good value..highly recommend
4,Very Pleased,"The lamp arrived within a couple of days of ordering. It was very easy to assemble. And I agree with another reviewer, it looks more expensive. It's beautiful and classic. The light is soft and not harsh. All in all, it's a wonderful piece."
2,Great looking on the box if workmanship could be as good as it looks,"The price is very reasonable but the workmanship is not very good. The base has a couple of quite visible holes in the iron like material. The worst problem is that the piece where the lampshade is screwed in is so badly off center that the lamp shade cannot help but being tilted, this is very evident."
2,Pretty but broken,"I actually purchased this lamp in the store and was so excited due to the beauty of the lamp. After I put it together I found that the on/off switch was broken. Then I had to disassemble and return it. I was very disappointed. Maybe it was a fluke, but it was enough to discourage me from buying another lamp from Target."
1,Busted,"I never finished unpacking the item from the box it came in. The first item I removed was the glass light shade which I immediately noticed had a little rattle to it. I soon discovered that a piece was broken off of the shade, so I put it back in the box and returned the item the next day. The package came from Target; it looked worn and beaten as though it had been moved around quite a bit. It also didn't seem to have the type of packing that Amazon uses. I'm going to buy a lamp now off the shelf at a store where I can inspect it before I buy it."
4,Disappointed but target.com made it right,"I was so disappointed when my lamp arrived and I found that the glass shade was broken into numerous pieces. I made one quick phone call to target.com, spoke with a very polite sales rep, and in no time I had a new shade. The lamp is very sturdy, well constructed, and a beautiful addition to my living room. I have received numerous compliments on it"
1,steaming book,Useless book--and idiot would know anything covered in it. I gave it immediately away to the charity.
3,"If you're in your thirties, still living with Mom and Dad, then dwelling on an iceberg sounds pretty good.","""Strange Places"" is one of the most amusing books I have ever read. I think the title is misleading: this volume is not suggesting locations where one can abide without money. On the contrary, Mr. Fisher suggests purchase of a nuclear power station to make life more palatable while residing in the Arctic. The most realistic proposal is the one most likely to have been field tested by the author: tunneling under a house, and putting a couch in the hole.I rank this book with Reich's ""Listen Little Man"" for sheer hilarity."
5,Yummy Good!,"I appreciated being able to purchase this item over the internet. I live in a very small town and do not get into larger areas to shop very often. This item is something not carried in small convenience stores. I like the item because it is sugar free and fat free making it a good drink when a person is watching calories.I have used the product for quite some time and, in the past, was able to buy it in a canister. I have not been able to find the canister packaging for this item for a long time and would really prefer that because so much of the purchase price wouldn't go to packaging.Thanks so much for sending this item out so quickly."
3,OK product,"This is a digitized tape of a TV program shot by a local TV station. Video is 'pixelated' in faster movement, and the shots are 'canned' in many ways. Sound is good. Roy was a singer more than an entertainer, and this typifies it. It is an OK addition to a fan's library."
5,No Limits On ... Live at Austin City Limits,"I watch this DVD at least twice a month and I never tire of it.I believe that Roy had his famous"" butterfly"" stomach at the beginning of the show,half way through the first song Roy hithis stride.The rest of this show was outstanding.Roy was usingsome of his favorite musicians for this performance.You could tell that Roy really was enjoying the ""jamin"" during the show.All of the musicians were excellent.The DVD is awesome becauseI can hit the zoom in button and get great close shots of Roy'sface.Some people have said that they don't like his looks. Allthat I can say to that, is they don't know beauty when it hits them in the ""ears."" With the quality of this DVD shown on my large screen TV,it is almost as good as having Roy standing inmy living room.I also enjoyed the Documentary Footage,Still Gallery and the Song Lyrics.I also have it on VHS.But the DVD isa better way to enjoy Roy Orbison performing.I love,love,lovethis DVD!!!!!June 21, 2004"
2,Live at Austin City Limits,"I don't care for watching this older version of Roy Orbison's music. He seems to put more ""soul"" into his music in more recent years after the songs become more popular."
2,Not as expected,Ordinarily it would have been a pleasure to watch and listen to this release. But having just watched 'Black & White Night' this newly purchased DVD 'Live at Austin City Limits' is a big let down. Same songs and star but the back ups and supporting artists just don't carry their own. The arrangement is the biggest flop. This album is going to the garage sale.Save your $ and buy 'Black & White Night'-it's as good as 'Live at Austin City Limits' is a disappointment.
5,Great Foundational Video,"This video does a great job of explaining the basis of perspective drawing. Mr. Robertson starts with simple 1, 2 and 3 point perspective and systematically walks us through mapping out a perspective grid in space. Using this and other simple techniques, we then begin to understand how we can construct any object in correct proportion, scale and perspective. If you are serious about learning to draw things that feel like they have a basis in reality, this is video is worth every penny."
2,Bad quality,"The quality of this video is horrible. The content is great but you cannot see basically nothing because of the poor quality of the video. I contacted the company who sells this video and the answer was tough luck, this is an old video.I would recommend to get other videos from this author that are done with better quality."
2,questionable,"There is quite a lot of questionable content in the book; claiming that snapping your fingers sends air that skrikes your palm creating a snapping noise is kinda stupid. Theres a lot of outdated information in this book as well, and as a reviewer stated already, there is a discernable western bias throughout many sections. The corniness of this book makes it seem like it was intended for a 2nd grader."
2,Wrong answers to a lot of question....,"In the section about eggs there is a question about what determines the color of the chicken egg. The author said that it is determined by the color of the chickens feathers....Wrong! You can determine what color egg a chicken will lay by the color of her earlobes. A chicken with white lobes will lay white eggs and a chicken with red lobes will lay brown or tinted eggs. We wont even get into blue,green and olive eggs...."
2,"Yes, fish drink water. No, that's not very interesting.","Don't let the quirky title of this trivia book fool you. This is not a very interesting read. Typically, I find that the most interesting trivia books are the ones that either ask really off the wall questions or those that have some kind of game component to it. This book tries to be the former and fails quite miserably at it. Practically none of the questions are all that quirky or funny, nor does Mr. McLain's writing make the answers interesting or funny. This is a book of straight up useless information. Not only that, but having been written 10 years ago, this book also has many inaccuracies (ex. the Titanic was sunk by a 200 foot gash in the hull rather than the currently accepted ""morse code"" hull punctures). Still, there are some interesting nuggets of information that you can throw around at your local cocktail party. However, there are probably more interesting, and more up-to-date, trivia books on the market."
3,Good for leisure,"It's an old book, but I still find it interesting, with good picks of questions (on 20 categories) followed by concise answers. In particular I like the following the most:-Do dolphins ever sleep?Is it true that elephants are afraid of mice?Do fish drink water?What came first, the chicken or the egg?..............Despite my preference, an individual's liking of it will depend much on whether he/she is interested in the topics chosen by the author. So please check the table of content available here on Amazon before you make your purchase."
2,Inaccurate and Unnecessary,"The first page I turned to in this book had the facts wrong. On page 126 McLain says that Isaac Asimov ""did not write lengthy books."" Well, I have on my desk Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science & Technology, and it is over 800 pages. So his research is sloppy. ""Do Fish Drink Water"" is a collection of miscellaneous facts, which was once a popular type of reference book. But in the Internet era, Google has rendered such books unnecessary; there is no fact in McLain's book that you can't find faster and with more up-to-date information with a quick online search.So why bother to read it or for that matter write it?"
3,Small quibbles,"Though there were parts of this book that I found interesting, usable, surprising, etc., I've also seen better such compilations. I was put off by a mistake in an answer about football which had Bernie Kosar rather than Doug Flutie throwing the amazing ""Hail Mary"" pass at the end of the Miami v. Boston College game in 1984! Also, I concur with the reviewers who found the parenthetical asides cringe-worthy. I regret Mr. Mclain's passing and would still reccomend the book as one to visit in an idle moment."
4,amazing book,"THIS BOOK ASKS YOU QUESTIONS AND TELLS YOU ANSWERS TO EVERY ONE OF THEM. QUESTIONS THAT NO ONE HAS NEVER EVER THOUGHT ABOUT ASKING BEFORE. IT IS A WONDERFUL THING TO READ ABOUT BECAUSE MOST OF IT IS QUESTIONS THAT ARE VERY INTERESTING THAT YOU MIGHT'VE NEVER HEARD ABOUT BEFORE, BUT ARE TRUE. IT IS LIKE RIPLEY'S BELIEVE IT OR NOT, BUT DIFFERENT IN IT'S OWN WAY."
5,Wonderful!,"So you've probably heard of ""The Way"" on Fastball's second cd, but what about their music before it all. Make Your Mama Proud really goes back to the roots of the band and although some songs may not strike your fancy, overall it comes together as one BEAUTIFUL work of art! Yes, this is more punkish than their other albums, and yes there is a little foul language. However, I am not a very ""punkish"" person and I still think that this is one of their best cds. Buy it! It's worth it! What's not to like?"
4,Energetic,"Different from their second album, which offers catchy guitar-driven pop and a greater variety of sounds. This album is more one-dimensional, raw, and straight-forward (with the exception of ""Fallout"" which is the only song that sounds as though it belongs on All the Pain Money Can Buy). At the same time, this album is still catchy and memorable in its own right. The songs here offer driving beats that end only two soon and the two lead singers switching off for many of the songs does lend some additional sense of depth and creativity. A few of the knock-out tunes on here are ""Human Torch"", ""Make Your Mama Proud"", and, quite possibly the best (and the shortest) piece on the album, ""Nothing"". All in all a worthwhile purchase for hardcore Fastball fans or for punk-oriented fans."
4,"Loud, Catchy, But Lacking In Depth","'Make Your Mama Proud' is fast, loud, and at times downright addictive. This album is far from being a let down, but at the same time you kind of feel like Fastball has more to offer than this. It's nothing less than expectation, yet on some tracks nothing more either. Don't get me wrong, songs such as ""Nothing"", ""Emily"", and ""Telephone Calls"" will crawl inside your brain and have you humming it all night long, the album does not lack that finger snappin' feel. However, there is a lack of depth. Hooks along with decent songwriting about life in the slow lane are about all the album has to offer."
4,Awesome!,"This CD is the best one ""Fastball"" has made! It is a whole lot better than ""How Much Pain Money Can Buy"". Just about all of the songs in this CD are excellent."
2,"Good sound, bad CD","After ""all the pain"" I tried this one. Mistake. Most songs, except ""fallout"" are quite bad. The frantic pace and weirdo lyrics don't help much, either.This CD just makes their sophomore CD seem better, and mature. Buy ""all the pain"" and forget about this garbage."
4,A band w/ great potential,"This band has everything to make it big, they just need to find the right songs. They are still good, but if they find the right stuff and go with their same style they'll be HUGE!"
5,Great Album!,"If you're a fan of Fastball's ""All The Pain Money Can Buy"", beware. This cd *is* completely awesome too, but it's way punkier (is that even a word?) than the second album. I find that the bass lines are more fun and the songs are faster and less inspired, but it still makes for great listening!"
5,"This CD is fast, loud and rocks the house!","I bought this CD after buying ""All the Pain Money Can Buy"" and I loved the raw energy in the CD. I love Rock and Roll alot! Buy the CD as well as All the Pain Money Can Buy because they're filled with great songs."
3,"This was an OK start, but they had a much better follow-up","After hearing ""Are You Ready for the Fallout"" and ""Emily"" live at last year's H.O.R.D.E. festival, I thought this would be a good album, and it was. However, the key word here is GOOD. GREAT would describe their second album, All the Pain Money Can Buy. Make Your Mama Proud has a more punk feel and the songs are missing a little something -- length! The songs don't really leave you wanting more, but it would be nice to hear what there would be."
3,An Early Fastball Album,Not my favorite album by Fastball. It sounds like it was force made. It doesn't have the heart and soul that other albums by Fastball have. I still don't mind having it in my collection. It just tells me that the band is way better at creating music than a record label ever will be.
5,Absolutely refreshing insights to our Christian Faith,This was the first book to truly lead me in my endeavour to understand the Jewishness of my Christian Faith. This book is a must read for any true student of Bible prophecy attempting to understand what is going on in the world today. It will open your intellect to take a fresh look at what you can and can't dig into.
2,not very good...,i could only read an hour of this. so many peaple seem to throw together books without thinking. this author is one.
3,Flimsy,"Don't expect doctor quality. They are light and cheaply made. Bought for a little kid, no problem. You also need to build."
2,Meh...you get what you pay for.,It was a cheapie to start off school. I used it once and then switched to a better model when I could afford it.
4,Rock and Roll Theatre,"Freddie Mercury was a genius and this collection is a must have for anyone who related to Wayne and Garth when the jammed to Bohemian Rhapsody. It's a guilty pleasure, without the guilt!"
4,One Amazing Performer!,Freddie Mercury can never be replaced. This music collection is a good place to understand the talented Freddie Mercury.
5,This rocks!,This is yet by far the best culmination of greatest hits on a double CD set. POP the top on your convertible and go!
4,New Queen Fan,"Over the Queen years, the outer edges of my ears has registered a few Queen songs such as 'Another One Bites The Dust', 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and one I really like 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love', and that was about it. I have never bought a Queen album until this one. I must say I am thoroughly amazed. This group was true genius. The tight vocal harmonies and fresh lead vocals of Freddie Mercury are terrific. Every song on this double album shines. Even the sad dark songs here have a light touch to them. Ballad or rock this is a must have album - I'm glad I have it."
4,Good but missing one good song.,"I would say this would sum up all the greatest of Queen except one song ""These are the days of our lives."" How could you forget about that great beautiful balled? That would be the only complaint."
3,"Almost complete Greatest Hits, but still an excellent gift.","Like the title states, it is an ""almost"" greatest hits, but still an excellent gift. The reason, that I say ""almost"", is that it doesn't have tracks from the first Highlander. Even though, these are on the CD, A Kind of Magic, still, it was the primary songs, that made the movie, a cult classic(i.e., Princes of the Universe, and Gimme the Prize(Kurgan's Theme). However, it does have Who wants to live Forever. I brought it, for my cousin, for his 30-something birthday. And from what I have heard, he's playing it, to death. The service from Amazon is stellar, as usual. Keep up the excellent work."
3,Great compilation with one travesty.,"Love the greatest hits compilation, but somebody made the inane decision to place an incomplete version of ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" (one of my favorite Queen songs) on this disc. It's missing about a third of the original run time, and renders the song unlistenable for me."
5,A must have!,"Here it is...the best of Queen, with the exception of ""These are the Days of Our Lives"" (a single released after Freddie's death) and any of the songs from the Made in Heaven album. Included are all the top songs: Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You, We Are The Champions, Another One Bites the Dust, Under Pressure (with David Bowie), and Crazy Little Thing Called Love. You can hear how Queen's sound changed over the course of their 20 year career, plus you get liner notes showing the original single covers and other information. What more could a fan want????"
5,A great buy for newcomers to Queen!,"We all have CDs where there are 1 or 2 listenable songs and the rest are horrible. This is NOT one of them! This compilation is one of the best, most poignant and most fun that I own!! I recommend this CD set to anyone who has taste!"
3,No Thanks...,"The two American compilations are a mess, but this double CD set does little to fix that. Yes, it's better organized, but it's also missing classics like ""Body Language"" and ""Tie Your Mother Down""."
5,Rediscover this historic band,"I had been a casual Queen fan most of my life - well, ever since Wayne's World made Bohemian Rhapsody a hit. At the time, I got myself a copy of ""A Night At The Opera,"" and have enjoyed it in the years since. (In fact, I recommend it as a companion to this greatest hits collection.)But recently I was at an Aqualung concert, and to end the show Matt covered ""Somebody to Love."" It was so awesome, that it got me thinking about Queen again, and really craving their music. Which brings me to this collection. I was familiar with about half the songs here, which was great. But what I'm most happy about is all the new Queen music it has introduced me to (such as ""Radio Ga Ga"" and ""The Show Must Go On"").I can't say whether it's an accurate ""greatest hits"" anthology, but I can say that there are a ton of awesome songs here. If you're a casual fan like me, then this collection will lead you into die-hard fan land. And it's guaranteed to blow your mind. :)"
5,As slick as Mercury,"I was introduced to queen in an unusual way, through the movie Highlander. The soundtrack was pure Queen and had such power that I just had to hear more. Of course Queen is an institution now, the ultimate 80's band but for me they will always personify Rock Opera. Their music video's may have distracted people from the fact that their music was very cleaver. Characterised by complex melodies and contrasting choruses, they managed to produce more unforgetable songs than any other band I can think of. This album is good value because it will stick in your head all day, just like elevator musak only in a good way."
5,Opus I & II,"After so many reviews, there isn't much left to say about the work of this band.What makes people enjoy their music (aprox. 130 million copies sold worldwide, even though they're not in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame)? Maybe is the diversity of rock styles in their songs, maybe the powerful voice of Mercury, or the sophisticated guitar arrangements of May, who knows.This CD is definetely a brief story of a succesful career."
1,Badly recorded,"I dont know if I got a defective copy, but there is distortion and breaking up of sound on this set. listen to a download before you get it."
3,A LITTLE TOO LONG,"Queen has written some catchy songs with good hooks and melodies. But they do not warrant a two cd set, its a little long. If your a big Queen fan this is for you, but for the regular fan or not so big fan, it's too much. And the single disks Greatest Hits and Classics, both 3 stars, are a mixed bag, with only about half of each having enough songs to be called a classic or a greatest hit. We Will Rock, We Are the Champions, The Show Must go On, Another One Bites the Dust, One Vision, Under Pressure, plus a few other good songs. But overall, too much lag in between the really great songs, and the okay, and not so great songs."
1,very dated and overrated,Dont waste your money folks. Queen fans will love it. Its a party for freddie wannabies but the rest of us dont get an invite. Avoid like the plague and dont let any small children of the age of 10 near it cause they will probably go through a Queen phase for 2 years. You've been warned
1,WISH THAT -30 STARS WAS AN OPTION...QUEEN ARE TRASH!!!,"I never could stand why Queen are classics?? They are awful and they suckand they certainly the most overrated band after Pink Floyd and before Pearl Jam. I just hate them..all their songs are lousy and put me to sleep especially horrible trash tunes like Bohemian Rhapsody, Fat Bottommeed Girls, and We Are The Champions. This may only contain the band's single decent song which I always enjoyed We Will Rock You. I just wish that there was a star that was -30 and a 3 stars for We Will Rock You. Stay away from albums by Queen, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and AC/DC who are trash and only meant for drug addicts! Foreigner, Dire Straits, and Metallica are much,much better! Get their albums insted."
1,QUEEN ARE FOR LOSERS,"Queen are definately one of the worst bands of all time ever after TRS(The Rolling Stones), the Doors, U2, and Black Sabbath. They should be dishonoured for making such awful trash tunes like Bohemian Rhapsody, We are the champions, Another one Bites the Dust, and fat bottommed girls. Please avoid this CD at all costs and buy any of the four Metallica albums insted."
5,Queen,If you like Queen you will absolutely enjoy this CD collection. Queen is just fantastic even after all these years. Very satisfied with this purchase. Highly recommend for those that enjoy talented groups of the past that still 'rock' even today. Talent never ages and this CD is a classic example of one of the best!
5,Queen Greatest Hits,"I love Queen Greatest Hits, however, only disc one was in the package. Disc two is missing. I would like to get the second disc as ordered. Please send ASAP, otherwise I'll need to retun the whole thing. Thanks."
5,The best of the best,"I have all of Queen CDs, but this one, it's simply amazing. Here you have recopilated Queen's greatest hits(that's why they call it like so). Please, don't miss some of the best songs like Bohemian Rhapsody, Somebody to love, Now I'm here and Seven seas of Rhye on the first CD and Innuendo, Under Pressure, Headlong, The show must go on and The Miracle on the second CD.The best CDs ever, no doubt."
5,Improve your golf game,"THE GOLF INSTRUCTION MANUAL is a fantastic educational tool for improving all aspects of your golf game. I first was made aware of this book at a local library and wanted one for myself for continued referral. It is an ongoing source of tips, lessons and exercises designed to fix your game and lower your handicap! Works for me!"
1,"Simplistic, unstructured and very overrated! Avoid.","Reads like a compilation from a golf magazine and is disjointed because of it. Most of the points and drills are not new and rather uninspiring. And to have Ernie Els listed is really misleading. He wrote a bland introduction, and appears in maybe one picture sequence. SAVE YOUR MONEY! There are much better books out there from real masters (starting with Hogan, Price, Faldo, Woods... just to name a few), and many simple manuals such as the PGA instruction manual are far better. Repeat: Save your money and buy a cheaper and better book."
1,Mixture,"I have about 8 books of golf and I think that it's the worst, because there are a mixture of drills, advices, pictures, etc. All of them confuse me a lot with differents or contradictory advices."
5,An Excellent Instruction Manual For Beginners/ Intermediate,This is another well-made book by DK Publishing. Extremely well illustrated and well written. It covers all the basics of golf technique and makes it easy to understand. This is one of three books by DK that I would buy for anyone beginning golf. It is one of the few books I keep on the shelf and refer back to often for review of the basics.
5,Used as Supplemental Instructional Material,The videos from Liberty Kids are so hard to find but they helped my students to better comprehend curriculum from that era which may have been difficult to understand. The materials helped my student comprehend the regular lesson fully and my children at home watch these movies over and over again for years. My 19 year old daughter's 5th grade teacher had her class watch it at home everyday at 4pm and write about what they learned in the movie and built her lesson from that. I did the same for my students and added comparisons with stories from the text and the aced every test. HOPE THIS HELPS...
3,Liberty's kids..... * yawn *,This was a great movie when i was 7... i guess i have just grown out of it. it's a great movie about the american revolution!
3,It's working OK but would not recommend for buying,"This servo has a particular engineering problem. When it needs to rotate shaft to CCW direction after the position gets found something is still rotating inside of the gear box. This does not happen if it positioning happens CW direction, the motor becomes silent. My first thought was I got a defective part. However the replacement had exactly the same issue. So, it is actually as designed. The work around is for CCW rotation positioning 8 degrees more then you need (overcompensation logic), so it passes over the point, and then move CW 8 degrees back. This stops the gears rotating and servo will stay silent."
5,Hitec 31055S HS-55 Economy Sub Micro Universal Servo,These little servo motors were ordered create projects using a Arduino board. They worked as expected. I'm happy with the product.
5,Justin Silver's DOG in the CITY,"Justin Silver has that special something that makes him a wonderful dog trainer. In this show he says ""I speak Dog"" and he does. The dogs he is called upon to help are better for his visits with them and their owners. What he does with these dogs is wonderful. He understands their problem and it is amazing how takes care of it. Please watch the whole series, my favorite story of all of them is the one about BEEFY. Each session has taught me important things that Amy, my mini-Schnauzer and I use now. I truly enjoyed and learned from every session, hope you do too. He is a great teacher. Sandy, Largo, FloridaI Speak Dog"
4,Promo Edition,"I have the advance edition of this cd which is called 'electalux' instead of 'e-lux'. I don't know if any of the arrangements or production has been modified but the number and order of tracks is still the same.I only listened to this album because of the great band name. I was expecting a RATM/ ATD-I style heavy punk style album and was very shocked to hear a girl singing. Being a Cannibal Corpse fan, grrl bands are definately not my thing but i gave it a chance and i have to say that after 2 listens you are hooked.I agree with other reviewers that the singers vocals are brilliant. The tracks that stick out are tracks 4, 7, 13 and the best track 11. There are no poor tracks.The style is kind HEAVY/ MELODIC but to say its metal is going to far. The riffs are good and knid of hard rock/ soft metal but its only hardcore when compared to 'No Doubt'. The sound is pretty mainstream and alternative radio friendly but still worth a listen. Pleasantly suprised.Damn- They already broke up!"
5,Ahhhh...the good ol' days of Hollywood in the 90's,"What a great time for music in Hollywood! Some of the most influential (and not so influential) bands came from Hollywood in the 1990's. Human Waste Project was one of the more influential, but a bad record deal with a crappy label put this band into the annals of mere local rock history. I remember well the days of seeing Human Waste Project, LAPD(later Korn), Grinchfist, System of a Down, and many other greats on a Friday night at the Coconut Teaszer. Too bad those days are gone...This album is one of the best unknown hard rock albums made in the 1990's. I highly recommend it."
4,What a read!,"Not only is this a must-have for all Sopranos fans, but even haters of the show may change their mind about the Sopranos after reading this! This book makes it seem like the story is fact not fiction! I cant wait til next season!"
4,insightful,"this is a great companion to the series, and filled in some needed detail for me. now i can't wait till the new season starts!"
5,All due respect...,"Wonderful. This is a must for die-hard Sopranos fans, filled with inside information about the characters and actors. My review may not be the greatest but the book is."
5,Frog for Dog,"THe only toy that the dog likes, plus it takes a beating and cheaps on crinkling. We all love these frogs."
1,This tape is really bad,You do not get a good workout. The moves are not fun. You stay in the same place. I am so disappointed because african dance is a wonderful form of exercise.
5,African Video,This was my first time experencing African dancing. It was easy and lots of fun! Thanks!
1,Betrayal to nature....contains spoiler!,This story was going along good until toward the end...the man caged the cardinal and then it died as a result...he did this just to supposedly win the girl...and he had promised to protect all the birds!!!....WHAT a as stupid ending...do NOT like the fact that he broke his vow to protect the bird...and what is just as dumb is the girl upon receiving the caged bird should have let it go because it was said that she liked the Audubon society and such....thought they were true nature and bird lovers..just REALLY disappointed with this and will be deleting off my kindle !!!!!!!!
5,African American Achievement,"Johnnetta B. Cole is a valued member in the African American community, we support her efforts to empower Black people."
5,Tasting Afghan Cuisine,"An excellent book -- it begins with a short history of some of the influences of Afghan cookery and includes a list of the common ingredients used by the people. From there, the reader really gets the ""feeling"" of life in pre-war Afghanistan and the cooking and serving process. Many of the dishes may one day become ubiquitous American favorites, just as pizza and lasagne became favorites here after World War II. A real treat to read and easy to use, as the author give many suggestions for substitutions for ingredients that are not easy to find. I recommend it highly."
1,"Afghan food, minus spices.","Why on earth would you write an Afghan cookbook and leave out the spices? I love Afghan food and this book was a huge disappointment. I find it hard to believe that well-made aushak has no flavoring other than salt and mint. Worse than worthless, because it could have been so much better."
4,Afghan Food and Cookery,"This is outstanding because there are so few books with Afghan food as the topic. Even this one is about 50% Pakistani and Indian along with about 50% Afghan, but the 50% that is unique makes it worthwhile to own."
2,don't bother,"I thought these recipes were pretty challenging, yet they generally turned out tasteless and undercooked. My Afghan boyfriend didn't recognize most of the recipes I made."
5,Wonderful introduction to Afghani cooking!,"Quaint drawings and loads of cultural information add to the many and varied authentic Afghani recipes in this helpful book. The author devotes space to helping the reader with unfamiliar terms and ingredients by including a chapter called The Afghan Kitchen. It describes different foods, spices and seasonings as well as techniques. She also writes an introduction which gives information on Afghan culture, traditions and customs. The recipes are easy to follow, delicious, authentic, and most have a little fun fact or helpful tip at the top. Pen and ink drawings are peppered throughout, which gives the reader a peek into the lives of these hospitable and interesting people."
5,Finstad at her best!,This book grabs you from the beginning and never lets you go! More twists and turns than a fiction writer could imagine. It is Finstad at her best!
4,Quick view of basic dance steps.,"Christy Lane's Jazz Dance Level 1 Video gives a quick over view of the basic beginning jazz dance steps. The video teaches isolations, simple turns, jazz walks/steps, a few kicks, and two simple jumps. The video also encorporates two simple combinations at the end for beginners. The video is a good refresher for students of dance who have not danced for awhile. While the video shows great technique, many of the dance steps are only shown on one side of the body, and the steps are gone through rather quickly at times. Unfortunately, Christy gives the learner only one or two slow chances at the step, and then quickly moves the step up to tempo.I believe the video shows great technique and proper body positioning. However, the pause and rewind buttons on your VCR will be used a lot in order to practice the steps."
4,Good vac for light duty.,"This vacuum works fairly well for lighter duty use, but don't expect to suck up large rusty nails or similar nasty jobs with it. The horsepower is only adequate for smaller jobs, and the smaller dhose iameter (1.25"") is a limiting factor. On the plus side, it's a great compact size that doesn't take up too much room in my shop, and is easy to carry around the house. I wish it came with more attachements like a crevice tool..."
3,shopvacs yearly - don't know why,I probably go through one shop vac yearly. I don't know why but they all burn out no matter what brand or what size motor. I change filters according to guidelines monthly needed or not and mainly suck up saw dust from saws and sanders. I occasionally suck up water maybe twice a year with an over flowing drain or what ever but i have tried all vacs big small weak and powerful. Help? nothing's working. They just keep buring up around thanksgiving every year.
4,Satisfied,Received product very quickly. Book condition was marked as 'good'. It looked 'new'. Very satisfied with service and condition of book.
1,Swing era:Artie Shaw/Tommy Dorsey,"Sirs:I don't could make a review, because until yet I don't receive this article.¿is possible know why happens this.Hugo Cornejo Torres"
3,not a bad soundtrack,"It sort of bothers me that most of the songs on here are shorter than 2 minutes. You'd think the company who released this soundtrack would have balanced it out with short AND long tunes, but they didn't. That's not to say the music is bad. The disc contains a few memorable songs. I just wish the CD included a couple songs longer than 2 minutes."
4,Fun,"Fun item, don't know how durable they are, but even if we get a summers use out of them they were inexpensive and my daughter liked them."
5,Perfect accent!,"Fluffy, cute, not too long, and fit easily into handles (by the way, they slide into holes in the handlebars. I couldn't see from description or reviews how they were mounted. Not sure if all bikes come with those predrilled holes, but the one we bought -- a Glide Bike -- did. The ends are about the diameter of a pen or magic marker)."
4,Second Edition will be out in late 2004,"This book has been updated. The updated version will appear as: Mediation & Conference Programs in the Federal Courts of Appeals : A Sourcebook for Judges and Lawyers,Second Editionby Robert J. Niemic2004"
2,I'll save you the trouble,"Like in ""Chasing Amy"" the guy gets the girl. It was a twist that my partner and I were really not interested in. She then ends up leaving him to be alone anyway. The main character is manipulative and I quote ""treats everyone she loves like s@#t"". The music is cool and some scenes are very sexy...then there was the guy...."
5,Guaranteed to be great,"Haven't seen this DVD and guess I won't for another 7 YEARS as they're telling me, but having seen him before this was recorded and 13 times afterwards, I will guarantee you that the early Billy Joel and his band, is still the all time best. Hey, I even went out to Vegas to see him at the Hard Rock Hotel (the Joint) to see him perform in a SMALL VENUE for the first time in 25 years. It was worth the investment. I have a question. Why advertise a DVD that won't be available for 7 years. Hell, I might not be around, but thank God my kids appreciate early BJ. Jon Gongwer, Ashland, Ohio"
4,Sanctuaries of Childhood,Sanctuaries of Childhood is a book with good parenting ideas. I am reading this as someone who is in the age range of grandparent. What amazed me is that so many of the ideas in this book were things that I did with my children. My daughter and I were just remembering her bedtime routine and it was similar to the ideas suggested in this book. I would recommend it to first time parents and grandparents.
3,"Author needs a good editor, otherwise . . .","the book is useful if one is seriously thinking of actually buying real estate in Nica. If you want just a good book on the country with an eye towards traveling there, get the Moon Publications book. It's by far the best of the lot.While this is not the most professionally written or edited publication, it does have the crucial information you need to know about before buying in Nica. Essentially, there are three types of documents you need to get a hold of and to verify before purchasing a property. A good, clean title is essential, especially since some of the lands were expropriated from large landowners during the Sandinista years and given to local groups. Some of the groups are now selling parts of their ranches and these lands may have clouded titles. Get a local lawyer not associated with the real estate agent would be my recommendation. Overall, good book, but don't expect a great read or an in-depth review of the country itself."
1,Offensive and contemptible,""". . . quality Latin women are difficult to meet.""Unklike other reviewers on this page, I do not find this statement from Mr. Howard's book ""applaudable,"" rather, it is offensive, racist, and totally indicative of the sleazy, sloppy undercurrent running through this book that caters to tax-evading ugly Americans looking for ""companionship"" with a girl a third their age. Fortunately, not all gringos moving down are like this; many good-hearted folks are coming down too, people that are sensitive to the grinding poverty of their new adopted country and are doing something to try to improve the situation instead of just buying it all up at rockbottom prices."
1,"U.S. imperialism, again...","Nicaraguans have long fought the exploitation of the U.S. government. Now they face the exploitation of U.S. citizens looking for a cheaper version of paradise. Nicaragua doesn't need more foreigners buying up its beaches, colonial homes and tourist facilities. You are not helping Nicaragua by using it as your own personal playground or investment."
3,Great in bits and pieces; mediocre as a whole,"The soundtrack to _The Crow: City of Angels_ has some excellent tracks on it that should appeal to alternative and rock fans. Filter's ""Jurassitol"" is excellent. Even though I'm not a fan of Hole or White Zombie, ""Gold Dust Woman"" and ""I'm Your Boogieman"" are quality songs. PJ Harvey's ""Naked Cousin"" and Seven Mary Three's ""Shelf Life"" are decent tunes, as well. The rest of this album, though, is mediocre. Tunes by Deftones, Bush, and Korn will garner some enjoyment by fans of those bands, but all sound like they were left in the b-side vault for good reason. It's not that this is a bad soundtrack, it's just that a lot of the remaining songs sound so generic."
3,The (Alternative) Radio Stars,"The formula from the first soundtrack nearly works as well here; collect artists from the alternative scene let their sounds create the mood found in the movie.The standout is Iggy Pop's blistering live rendition of I Wanna Be Your Dog, with White Zombie's hilarious take of the disco classic - I'm Your Boogie Man - titled, I'm Your Boogieman, a clear second choice. Fleetwood Mac's Gold Dust Woman receives a new look from Hole and Sean Olson by Korn is a solid performance.With PJ Harvey, Seven Mary Three, the Deftones and Tricky vs. The Gravediggaz, the vibe provides a nice cross-section into a more progressive FM radio playlist, but a good listen, nonetheless."
3,OK CD,"I really like Hole : I have the new Hole Cd ""Celebrity Skin"".But I think HOLE really messed up the Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac song ""Gold Dust Woman"".I think Fleetwood Mac does it way better.They shouldv'e got Stevie Nicks to sing it for the Soundtrack.But that is not a HOLE song,like some people think.This is an OK CD.] ~Chris~"
3,Not nearly as good as the first but it's not without some great tracks...,"Straight to the point. This album is not nearly as good as the first. But Hole, Rob Zombie, Filter, Pj Harvey, Bush (surprisingly amazing with the Joy Division cover... cause apparently this franchise really digs those), and Iggy Pop all have great songs so it certainly isn't a waste of money. But many of the other songs(and artists) have not withstood the test of time. I would say go grab some of the songs off of this, and a couple of the songs of the abysmal follow up (The Crow 3: A Movie No One Has Seen) and call it a day."
4,My Favorite CD,"Even though this CD came out in 1996, this is still one of my favorite discs. if you like alt-metal, buy this album. You won't regret it."
5,Deftones!!!,"All I gots ta say is check out the song called ""Teething"" by the Deftones! It is the most intense, powerful piece of rapcore music I have ever heard!!! I have spent many a nights building up my calf muscles while jumping up and down to that track over and over again! The Korn track ain't bad either, a little on the slow and pounding side. Kinda chunky, but I like! And I guess the Hole track ain't half bad so I'll give the record on a whole three stars. Word up! --Kelly Magovern"
2,Cheesy,"I really gave this movie the benefit of the doubt. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't get past the music, it was AWFUL! Organ music throughout? YUK YUK YUK. The music alone made the movie more like a cheap dimestore novel romance than anything. The set was fine. The acting passable (except for the little kid who was obviously NOT an actor!). The dialog, stiff. The story... was actually good. So, in spite of the awful music, the slow moving plot, some of the bad acting and stiff dialog, I'm glad I watched it all the way to the end. I liked the message. I liked the characters of Josh and Violet. If only the music used were different! It would have improved the movie exponentially."
1,"Good concept, but lacks support for new OZ-730 and OZ-750","The software would not connect to my OZ-750. It lacks supportfor the new OZ-730/750 Wizards. The OZ-730/750 devices are thereplacement devices for the supported, out of production, OZ-650PC, so I assumed that the software would support the follow-on products. After contacting IntelliSync and asking about future support for these new devices, I was told that there were NO plans to support these devices in the future. This is apparently a dead end product that will not be upgraded as new hardware is introduced. The only other product that will allow synchronization between the OZ-730/750 and MS Outlook and other PIMs is RuppLynx 6.0...and sells for $99.00 vs. $43.00 for the IntelliSync product. Too bad I had to spend the money on this product to find out about this incompatability. I now have totally worthless software. (It's non-returnable if it's opened....:*(...)"
5,Great Read!!!,"""Yucatan"" is a great read! Following the adventures of a newspaper writer from Boston as he ventures through jungles of the Yucatan Peninsula, Lawrence Dame has the ability to place you right into the story. An added bonus for me while reading this story is that I know David Legters. A missionary still working in Merida, Mexico, Dame meets David for this first time as a toddler playing around his parents hut in the village where they were working. If you read this book, you must read ""Maya Missions"", the book that Dame wrote following the work of the Legters in the Yucatan."
2,avition with no action,"This DVD set is simply bad, image quality is below average (transfer from VHS), the comment are worthless and the description from the Box is misleading, this is a collage of home-videos and television programs and it's nowhere near a documentary.The only posotive point is that each DVDs ended pretty soon (about 23 minutes each)"
2,Not too happy,"I wasn't too happy about the shape that the book was in. I wasn't expecting it to be perfect, but there were alot more tears and pages bent then I expected."
5,Keel roller,This product came in record time and was as advertised.I will order from this vendor without hesitation in the future.
5,Beautiful Beethoven Chamber,"The flute isn't my instrument so I can't claim to be an expert on its sound, but here is some beautiful music that even most Beethoven fans are unaware of. Thankfully this is a fairly affordable price for the discs as well."
1,Awful!,"One of the worst books I have ever read. Skimps on descriptions and even when the descriptions are adequate, it's just boring! Skips back and forth using first names and last names of characters (for example, the author sometimes refers to Douglas Clark as ""Doug"" and other times as ""Clark""). This book is so bad that it has now inspired me to write my OWN book and try to make some money off of bored, gullible people who have nothing better to spend their money on! Christopher Berry-Dee is a genius! (although thankfully I didn't buy this - I checked it out of the library)."
3,"good, but not great...","Ordered this DVD & got a email shortly after informing me that it does not have the necklace like the title says. I could care less about the necklace, but since it's included in the title it feels like I was being shorted. I liked the videos, but there were a few times when I felt like I could get better quality watching Youtube. I just want a disk with ALL of his videos. Preferably on Blu-ray. I would've made it 4 stars if it was all on one disk."
2,It doesn't matter how good it is for them if they wont take it,"I was so excited about this product and even shared the information with the parents group I belong to. When it arrived I gave it to my 6 year old who refused to try it based on the smell. I tried selling it as the taste of a sour gummi worm...no luck. I then offered him some Sprite to get use to the lemon lime flavor...it did get him to taste it, but then he stuck his heel in the sand even more. I mixed it with yogurt...still no luck. I am allergic to fish so I could not taste it myself. Does anyone know if the other flavor is better received?"
2,We tried...,My 9 y/o daughter really wanted to like this. She tried them by themselves for a couple of days but couldn't stand the taste. She decided to try them in lime or lemon flavored yogurt with hopes it would blend well. She gave that a try for a couple of days too-- but just couldn't stand the taste anymore.
2,Are we talking about the same product?,"We tried. OMG, we tried and failed miserably! My 8 y.o. daughter HATES, absolutely hates the taste of this product. I have tried mixing it with honey, sugar and finally resorted to giving her nutella immediately afterwards to rid the taste from her mouth. Since I have had marginal success giving it to her, it has been difficult to test its effectiveness. Seems like a great product, but a God aweful taste."
5,Absolutely unique,"I love a lesson in simplicity. It's unreal how much music Mr. Jones could get out of one string and a whiskey-bottle slide. Take a listen (the samples of tracks 1 and 2 are only of him speaking, so look further); if this is not too raw for you, buy the album."
4,A good source of information.....,I acquired this book at a swap meet many about 13 years ago.Back then i was the kind of person who thought a knife was a thing you kept in your pocket for peeling fruit etc.After reading the book I was bitten by the knife collecting bug!!I now have several hundred knives and I have always relied on this book as a concise yet informative history of 20 Century combat knives.I feel this book should be on the bookshelf of anyone who has an interest in or collects military knives. Highly Recommended!
5,A complete book,"A book which has all the necessary information that you need about fighting knives, specially those used in different wars. Excellent!"
3,Correction of book description,This book is not 700+ pages long. It is 79 pages long.This book is a reprint of a book published in 1944 by the Dutch government in exile in England.
4,Graduation Cake Pan,This is an overall nice pan. The center is thicker so it takes a little bit longer to cook through leaving the edges that are thinner a little dry.
2,Meh...,I thought that it started out well and it was leading towards a plot but then it seems to just drop off in the middle and it ends awkwardly. I realize that this yuri series is popular in the fandom but I like there to be a good story too which I think it was lacking in.
5,Every woman should read it!,"A nightmare experience at the hands of a brutal doctor who was giving her an internal exam sent Lara Owen off on this fascinating exploration into the rich underworld of the female body. It's a well-written, passionate and thoughtful plea for a return to body-consciousness and acceptance of what it is to be female. The case studies are inspiring, the ideas for self-healing and developing the creativity inherent at this time of the month very intriguing. There is no strident hectoring - Lara Owen writes from the heart - or should I say the womb - and has made a pioneering track for all women, whether interested in enjoying rather than enduring their periods, or the hidden depths of the female psyche. Men who want to understand women should read it too! If you read one book this year, let it be this one!"
5,Far Above Rubies,"This book is a refreshing look into the soul of a young black male. It's open, honest, and it leaves you wondering what he'll say or do next. I love the way the author shares intimate details of his personal experiences with the Lord. His writing stirred many emotions in me....laughter, crying, rejoicing, and praise as God seemed to take him by the hand and walk him through a journey called life. The author's love story really touched and captivated me. It's not often that we get a peek into the heart of a man. He is transparent and real, and I liked that. I recommend this to both men and women, as we can all benefit from the lessons he shares in this book."
4,good book if you don't know alot,"Like most tech books this is not something that you can read from cover to cover. However it is a good book for people just starting out in the trade or for people who want to understand how engines work. My biggest complaint with this book is its layout, in places its just crap. For example when your reading the text and it has see figure 2.5, alot of the time that figure isn't even on the same page and in a number of places that figure is 3 to 4 pages ahead of where your reading, which leaves you constantly flicking through pages. Surely its not that hard to get text and a picture on the same page? Other than that its OK."
5,This book is wide in scope and easy to understand.,This is that rare type of technical book which one might choose to read purely for pleasure. I searched local bookstores for a single volume which contained fundamental information of all automotive systems and could find nothing. This book has it all. It is writtten in language which any person of average intelligence can understand and is illustrated throughout. I would recommend it to anyone who feels his or her knowledge of automobiles is weak.
3,Are You Into A Lot of Diagrams?,"Using many diagrams and a utilitarian style, this book aims to train future mechanics. No chances are taken (""inverted"" is defined) and no fact is too obvious (dipsticks are explained). The authors struggle with the science: the two contradictory conventions for depicting current flow are explained as an ongoing scientific controversy; engine oils are ""distillated"".There's nothing special about the content; it follows the format of the ASE auto tech tests. The abundant manufacturers' diagrams help, but I feel sorry for anyone forced to learn from this book."
5,A comprehensive book for all mechanics,This book explains in detail almost anything a person would want to know about cars. It is great for the beginner to the intermediate mechanic. The color illustrations explain visually everything taught by the book.
3,Doesn't generate much HEAT --,"One must take into account that a lot of the ""lost"" films Something Weird releases to tape and DVD are ""lost"" for a good reason, i.e., they are not any good. PSYCHO LOVER is a good, sick piece of obscurity, about a psychiatrist scheming to get rid of his wife. It has a very Seventies look and feel, and THE MANCHURAIN CANDIDATE (yay!) is used as a major plot point. HEAT OF MADNESS is a black-and-white roughie about a rich girl who falls head over heels in love with a cheesecake photographer. The diretor is so unconcerned with art, he released this film without a musical score! If you've got time to waste -- alphabetize your CD collection instead!"
2,"Give it a break, Sotos!","At one time shocking and confrontational, Sotos seems content on taking us to the same ol' places in a cut-up, avant garde style. One would have a time coming up with a follow-up after ""Total Abuse"" and ""Pure"" magazine, however."
3,Disappointing,"I expected to see several drawings or sketches of grizzlies and found interpretive art - not what I expected, nor cared for."
4,SM Sex Through the Ages,"There are six novelletes in this book, the stories being set from Ancient Rome to the next century. The extremes of torture as eroticism are explored, not always with happy results, just about never with consensuality: that's what makes for the plots. This is not a book about happy, carefree people having lovely fun: its the dark side, and if that is your thing you will probably enjoy it. If you are only willing to entertain the politically correct, then avoid this book by all means and read Rebbeca of Sunnybrook Farm Does Dallas. Oh yeah; this is Gay SM, not Straight. They are very different fantasies, so be aware of that. Also, if you are looking for an introduction to the topic, this is not it: go to a primer. This is not stuff to try at home, nor is it for kids. But it is recommended for those who (a) understand what it is about, and (b) like this sort of reading.Mason Powell"
1,boring,Not much to this story...3 & 6 year old did not enjoy it. The illustrations are actually ugly. (No talent) I would not buy this again for anyone of any age.
2,near-enough-is-good-enough...NOT,"This book and tape set came highly recommended, and I did find the diction and sound quality clear. That and the very simple format make it suitable for pre-schoolers.As far as the quality of information provided goes: I should be used to it, but I'm not. Totally wrong pronounciation for the Chinese word ""dui"" (repeated in the chorus jingle on every page), inauthentic chop-suey Asian music, bogus pronunciations of ""Matthew""'s name in languages which have no ""th"" sound -- if this is internationalization then I guess green tea tastes like cola!Some of the tape time taken up with an adult-oriented song promo of PC values could have been used instead to provide a chunk of real music representing each country, instead of the brief, unidentified bitelet provided.Sorry to sound so condemning -- if you feel you can overlook the cliches and the inaccuracies, you will at least have a product which is honestly aimed at the simple needs of the under-5 set."
4,so far good,This item has been working great for me and my dog....just worried that it might not hold up in the long run....
1,Not so good,The bottle cracked shortly after buying the product however my husband threw it away instead of returning it. That was our no no. However I did see similar bottles a couple dollars cheaper at some local stores near by our home. I like the concept of the bottle but I would not buy it through Amazon.
3,Great product,"If you are going on long walks with your dog, this will be a great item to take with you.I didn't get the color I ordered and I also found the same item at T.J. max for half a price, but I bought that one as well for a friend."
1,PRODUCT NOT AS SHOWN,"If you're thinking about ordering this item, be aware that the description notes ""Colors may vary."" I overlooked that, so I expected to receive the cute pink water dispenser that's shown, but instead, I got an ugly blue one. I might as well have bought one of the ugly blue ones at Petco. Very disappointing."
5,The Gulpys are the best!,"I bought two and they are great, no leaking. I use them on walks and trips. Summer is coming and it will be a lot easier with the gulpys then carrying around a bowl and water bottle. The dogs do really good drinking out of them."
5,Excellent for all dogs and cats,This product is excellent for traveling with your animals. No muss no fuss. It also work for working dogs it can be cliped to your belt for easy access. I would recomend to to anyone. We saw a friend who had one and he told us he got it off Amazon. com so that is where we went and found ours.
3,Handy and functional,"We walk/run our dogs on the beach, and this dispenser has been instrumental in getting them to stop drinking seawater. You have to squeeze with steady pressure to deliver the water, but the dogs line up and love it."
2,"Adequate for a plastic dispenser, not without its faults","I was looking for an easy way to provide my elderly dog with water on our walks. I had previously been using a small plastic bowl and my own water but decided to try something a little easier to carry and where I would be able to save the unused water.This product was definitely easier to carry, but that was about the only criteria it met. The drinking vessel is quite narrow, even for my small dog and the plastic is quite flimsy. The bottle itself is not much better. The bottle is not 100% leak-proof, so be sure to avoid leaving it on its side or turning it upside-down. There is also no way to return the unused water back into the bottle so some will inevitably go to waste."
2,Not a Straight-Thru cable,"This cable is titled as ""Straight"" which means pin 1 on one RJ11 end goes to pin 1 on the other end. Most phone cables cross-over end to end, i.e. 1->4 2->3 3->2, 4->1. However, if you want a same pin to pin cable, you want a ""Straight-Thru"" cable. This product is NOT a Straight-Thru cable. The cable came packaged as Cable City Corp 31-P6402-07SV.C2G / Cables to Go 02970 RJ11 Modular Telephone Cable, Silver (7 Feet/ 2.13 Meters)"
5,Insightful,A fascinating and insightful look into what really went on in the days and months following Natalee's disappearance. I could feel Mr Holloways desperation and frustration as he was confronted with one false hope after another. A must-read for parents of teenagers who are contemplating a senior trip overseas.
3,book,"no dialog, kind of boring. I read the whole book and did enjoy parts of it but would have liked to had more dialog that it contained."
1,Credibility?,"Before one reads this, they need to consider one of the authors has also written ""Breaking Into Acting For Dummies"". Click on the author links above, it is listed. Author's personal webpage confirms it."
1,I don't think they want her found,"I am a psychic and Natalee contacted ME - In a dream, I didn't even know her, She was reaching out to me and, much to my better thought, I called the FBI and got a man who sounded like I interrupted his cozy nap and couldn't care less about my info or the case. This is the state of sad ways we live in these days. I wept for her then told her I tried - I told her I would and I did, but nobody cared nor listened. Maybe nobody wants her to be found.Jimmy Rae, South Florida"
3,It was just okay....,"I have just finished reading the book and was kind of let down. I have been following this story since day one and was excited to get the book when it came out. But there was nothing in the book that I didn't already know from the media. I thought the book would be different. Although I rated it with only 3 stars because for me it was just ""okay"", I truely with all of my heart hope and pray that this family gets some closure to this case. I applaud them for fighting to keep this in the spotlight because if they don't then who will??...."
1,Speculation and Supposition,"Having followed the case, there is nothing in this book that I couldn't have written. Rumor and what if are the foundation of the book. Alot of it has been explained to be untrue but still makes its way to the book. I bought the book with the hopes that a"" portion of the proceeds will go to the Natalee Holloway foundation for missing persons"" but as of yet I can find no specifics that such a foundation exists. Save your money until a book with credible references is available. Hopefully once the case is solved, if ever, we won't have to read about a father theorizing his daughter getting gangraped in a vehicle's backseat explaining why a less than credible witness didn't see the girl in the car."
1,sad sad sad,"Sad to see a dad take advantage of his daughter's misfortune. I agree with the other post above that this only shows the level of altered media coverage. Having been somebody that followed this case closely I feel like Dave (purposely?) left out some important details about the Aruban government's help in finding this person. Furthermore, some of the ""facts"" described on the Dr Phil show have been researched and found to be altered.The question this book raises is: if the Aruban government is called corrupt because of the case of this missing person, then what can we say about our own government corruption considering we have hundreds and thousands of such cases on a yearly, monthly, weekly basis?Don't get fooled by the cover of this book; nowhere is it clear how these ""facts"" or suppositions were acquired."
4,One of My Favorite Case,"I bought this book years ago and I still think that this is one of the most fascinating case ever. I have a huge interest ( passion ) for Unsolved Murder Cases and Missing persons cases. Cases like the murder of Cheri Jo Bates, the disappearance of Kristen Modafferi, the abduction of Donna Lass, the murder of Molly Bish and, of course, the disappearance of Natalee Holloway are my favorite cases. This book is great, after reading it I really had the feeling of knowing Natalee and her family. Everything about this book is great, and if you want to know everything about this sad but fascinating case then just buy this book, you won't regret it.Long live Natalee."
1,Little miss I'm NOT an angel,"This book doesn't give one specific theory about what happened. And what happened is very tragic. But this book portrays Natalee as an all innocent girl, and this she definitely is not. This could have happened to her anywhere in the US. Natalee proved her parents right, seeing how they are profiting from this tragic case."
3,Review of Aruba - The Natalee Holloway Story,"I never finished the book. About 2/3 of the way through I got really tired of hearing the bitterness within the words of the author (Natalees Father). Yes, I felt his pain but he continuously seemed critical of Natalees Mother and it showed in every chapter. Both parents lost a child here and a public book was not the way to express his obvious bitterness about Natalees Mothers 2nd husband or his money. Throughout the book he speaks in terms of ""I"" as though he were Natalees ONLY parent. As a Mother myself, I felt outraged that it was not ""WE"". Even though Natalees parents are divorced, they shared this loss.Many statements in the book are extremely contradictary and confusing. At one point it says the people of Aruba seemed to be hiding something and then in the next paragraph it says that almost everyone in Aruba offered to help in the search. I felt this book was more about the author than his daughter and I was greatly disappointed."
1,Stop The Presses,"How in the world can this book be released now that Dave Holloway has said, on national television, on March 4, 2006, that he received NO information from the police and the only information he has is from the media?What is going on here?"
1,verydisappointed,"This book is written telling only one side of the story. I found that the so-called facts that he presented were 100% inaccurate.He was inconsistent with many of the details. There isn't any basis for many of the claims he made. He states that he doesn't know what happened to Natalee, or if she is alive or dead, but then contradicts himself by saying that Joran harmed her in some way. Just as he and Natalee's mother and stepfather have done in the numerous interviews that they have given. They can't seem to tell the same story twice. This is just a brazen attempt by a conniving, scheming family to get money."
2,not bad to start with,"the tape is not bad ,it has nice stretching moves and instruction.but the only thing is that, it was short for me .it's concest of 2 parts the first is the solo stretching which is done by urself and the other part is done with a partner ,with it was not a use for me ."
5,Superb,"This book surprised me, to be honest. I was not sure what to expect, but I was spellbound from the first moment and could not put the book down. The book is about 460 pages +/-, and I read it in two days. The story is based very closely on real people and events that really happened, which made it very emotional to read. The author's writing is of excellent quality, with great character development, and a smooth style that keeps your attention.The story is about the persecution of the Waldenses by the Catholic church and the Duke of Savoy in the Alps region between France and Italy during the mid-1600s. It focuses on the man who became the military leader for the Waldenses during one of the persecutions, Joshua Gianavel. I fact-checked the story to some degree with available historical records and the author did keep the story very close to what history records of the events he depicts. I highly recommend this book."
5,Motor City Hardcore!,Hailing from Detroit the Suicide Machines are often called a modern day Operation Ivy. This albums proves that title.
4,The boys are back...,"This album is an absolute classic,they really know how to mix ska and punk into a different style.My favourite tracks on this are ""new girl"" and the hidden track ""i dont wanna hear it"" a cover version of a classic Minor Threat song"
5,Manic moshing delirium,"The Suicide Machines harmoniously blends energetic punk with swinging ska into a potent mix of punk rock fun.The album Destruction by Definition contains catchy bass tunes, (the unforgetable No face) drumming frenzy and Jay's screaming voice injects turbulent mixture of adrenaline induced mayhem straight into my head.I love it! If your straight up punk,then go ahead and listen to Bad Religion or Adolescents but if you prefer a little ska in your diet,then The Suicide Machines delivers the perfect mix of both styles."
5,Great Ska/Punk,"This is a must get album for fans of ska/punk. The Suicide Machines play an awesome mix of fast melodic punk mixed with awesome ska guitar, and occaisional horns. This is a great album all the way through, with only a few songs being a bit sub par compared to the rest of the album. Fans of Slapstick or Operation Ivy will probably dig this album. I highly recommend Destruction By Definition, and consider it a must for ska/punk fans."
5,Delicious!,This cd was pure awsome it is one of the best ska core bands ever and this is their best cd!
5,IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT DOWN,""" This novel is busting with razor sharp dialogue and a multitude of colorful, witty characters.Reed's debut novel, Bird Dog, jets along at a break-neck pace and offers more than surface impressions, painting a gritty tale of life in L.A. and the dark world of used car salesmen. Nothing hackneyed about this story! Refreshing and unique."""
4,A true page turner,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Low Rider and was on the edge of my seat the whole time -- couldn't put the book down. Harold Dodge is a believable and interesting character and I found myself cheering for him through all the twists and turns in the plot. I was drawn into the story from the first page and couldn't predict from one scene to the next which direction the action would go. If you want a book with lots of unexpected surprises, this is a great find."
3,Mostly Disappointing,The first half is hilarious but I did not laugh once during the second half. I would give the first 30 minutes 4 stars and the last 30 mintues 1 star.It's also probably the most vulgar stand-up routine I have seen. I don't mind the vulgarity but I just thought I'd inform you people.
2,Not good!,"I am a big stand up freak,and I checked this out because I heard it had a routine about rap's angry lyrics,and I HATE rap.So I rented this at my local video store,and I was greatly dissapointed.That was one of the only good routines in here.The first half had a couple of other decent jokes.Then the second half wasn't funny at all.His impression of a woman is so annoying.If you want to hear a good impression of a woman,check out Sam Kinison.He is hilarious.This is also is probably is the most vulgar stand up routine I have ever seen,so DO NOT let young children come CLOSE to this.Even if you are old enough,steer clear from this DVD.If you want good black comedy,check out Richard Pryor,Chris Rock,or D.L. Hughley's DVD."
5,GREAT CASE!,We have other intec products and have always been happy. This item is nodifferent. My boys especially love the finger stylus that came with the kit. The case is a great size and has alot of room for game storage. We received a black one and a silver one which worked out perfect. I did not smell any strong odor like in the other review. There is always a slight odor with new plastic. This case is great and I would recommend it to others. Has great accessories!
3,The Picture's Innaccurate,"I've seen this before in the stores and this picture is not correct for the DS Lite Pro Gamers Kit. I actually bought the product shown (the normal DS Pro Gamers Kit) and it wasn't that good. It came out right as the DS did and so the accessories weren't that good (most of them were actually for the GBA). It also wasn't very padded and did not shield my system well. I have however bought the GBA SP Pro Gamers Kit which has been incredibly useful so far, so I plan on buying the kit for the DS Lite as it looks to have more fitting accessories and a more padded setup similar to my GBA one."
4,pro gamer's kit review,"This is a good investment if your child has the Nintendo DS Lite console. The box is sturdy and protects the console and holds all the games, and the earphones are a great bonus! My only criticism is that the item shows it's available in white and pink, and we wanted one of each, but only allows you to purchase white."
3,mini helmet display case,a very nice mini helmet display case that's not what i used for i placed a mini 1950's time machine modelinside the case came with a rear mirror but it arrived wrapped but broken i contacted the seller and he saidhe would mail one out asap never arrived and seller did not make contact so while it's a nice product i wouldnot purchase from this seller again.thank youcommander klaa
5,Loved it!,Thanks! This is a fun ring. I got one for myself and my daughter....we both loved it! It is a reminder that we want to go on a horse ride together next year.....After we walk 500 miles and lose some weight!
2,One glaring problem with this book,"The book ""The Last Stuarts"" by James Lees-Milne could be a tolerable read, if not for one glaring problem: The French Language. The author is obviously proficient in French and wants you to know it, thus many quotes from the French speaking Stuarts are taken directly from letters and journals and entered into this book without translation. At times this becomes maddening. You are not going to understand a good part of this book unless you read both English and French very well.The stories are fairly interesting. The book is at times somewhat academic. For the most part, though, it is written to the bored housewife with an interest in royalty (""People"" magazine readers)."
3,The title is a bit of a misnomer,"Three things:First, this is a re-release of an earlier DVD.Second, the title is a deeply weird choice, given that this is taken from two concerts in Seattle and Portland from mid-2001 (two years before the 25th anniversary date trumpeted in the title).Third, the person bitching about Allison Cornell's performance on ""Glamour and Pain"" is out of his/her mind! Her performance is one of the high points of the show (and almost makes up for the songs being constantly interrupted).Okay, four things: anybody who liked the performances in the show(s) should look for the CD Two Rainy Nights, which features the same two shows.All in all, an okay DVD for the money (although I'd rather have an expanded version of The Big World Sessions; my LaserDisc is far too short)."
4,artistically driven,I believe the artistic way the DVD was filmed and the cut to interviews gave us an understanding of Joe and his brillance as an musical artist. Great show!!! I loved it.
1,Dishonest packaging,"The package says 4''x6'', but the paper is actually 4''x6.5''. Ridiculous, but too much trouble to return. Aargh. I'm one unhappy customer."
1,Does NOT work with Brother MFC-J825DW,"Like many other reviewers have stated, this paper ONLY works with HP despite the false advertising on the front.Returning all of this junk to Staples tomorrow."
1,Horrible paper,"This paper is so thin it's a joke. I have a Canon Pixma Pro 9000 markII printer, and just wanted some basic 4x6 paper to print a few things on, but the pictures that came out on this paper were terrible. Also, for whatever reason, the paper is actually 4""x6.5"", which is completely misleading. I returned it immediately."
4,Great for scrapbooks,"I like this paper because it's really thin and it prints well in my little HP printer. Perfect for printing out things for my scrapbook. Also, I like the fact that it's not completely glossy. The main drawback is that it doesn't dry very fast, so I usually have to let the prints sit for a while - sometimes overnight. The kind I've used before isn't coated on both sides, so they may have changed it slightly."
3,"Thin, ink dries quickly...","Very thin paper but works well with my HP printer. It's a bit pricier than the paper I normally buy but it has been worth it. I haven't had any paper jams and the ink dries very quickly on this paper.I wouldn't use it for professional documents though, I would buy a thicker paper for that kind of stuff, but otherwise, it's good stuff."
2,Hp Photo paper,"I recently purchased HP everyday photo paper and was not please with the thickness. It was too thin for pictures. Would be good for scrap booking, but I wouldn't recommend for everyday use."
5,If you can forgive.....................,"the rather dull engineering...this disc is worth having for its other merits. Given the time this music was composed, I'm surprised at its quality. Certainly worth having."
2,sockt dimmer,I did not like this product as two of the 4 I purchased burned out as soon as I screwed them in. I was told in another review that they would probably burn out when the bulb did but it didn't even take that long. I would not recommend this product
4,"A well researched book, worthy of anyone's time.","Truly, an interesting and informative book about the life of a man who put his conscience and belief in the Catholic Church above political expediency and in the end, his own life. For those who deem it noble to ""fall on the sword"", this is an inspirational book."
5,This is an absolute masterpiece,"Anyone with even the faintest interest in English history will thorougly enjoy Ackroyd's biography of Thomas More. The author's obvious erudition is never intrusive. His description of London at the time often reads like a modern guide book and his accounts of More's frienships, with Erasmus among others, are fascinating. Mr.Ackroyd should write one book a month like this one !"
5,One of the most elegant biographies I've ever read!,"As a voracious biography reader I have never come across a more loving, generous, and fascinating biography than this one by Peter Ackroyd. The book is resplendent with tales of life in the latter part of the middle ages. It is not only a biography but a cornucopia of interesting facts about this period of history. The author shows a remarkable ability to take you from the Christian baptism of Thomas More all the way to his death as a martyr under the brutish reign of King Henry the VIII. One of the most stunning, prolific, polished biographies I have ever read in my life! I highly recommend this one for anyone interested in history and in the life of Thomas More."
3,Flawed,"The insinuating, unpleasant, nasal tone of the reader on these tapes sabotages this book. Ackroyd supplies some general background information, but misses many opportunities to fit More's documented biographical information into a more complete tapestry of 16th century English society and politics. For those of us who have not read a biography of Henry VII, it would have been nice to know what made him so vicious and bull-headed, willing to have so many people, and some of England's best minds, violently tortured and executed. Ackroyd does a good, job however, in showing the origin's of More's piety and his friendship with Erasmus, and the growth and development of his family and career."
5,good deal!,"I have one of these recordings in an old LP. This CD set offers the complete series in much better sound and more economically too. Simon is one of the American treasures, a performer for more years than most of us have been alive. That kind of insight and experience don't happen everyday."
1,Nothing about Solaris 10,"This book dose not cover Solrais 10 features at all, if you are looking for the new features I would suggest that you wait ... I do not recommended for people who want to go for the solaris 10 examsThanks"
1,doesn't even mention basic service administration,"Most of the services for Solaris 10 are under control of the service management facility (smf - try 'man smf') and the svcs and svcadm command. You can't start, stop, disable, or enable most services without it.This book doesn't even mention them. It still refers to /etc/init.d/ scripts (some are still there but most, such as the various nfs and automount services are not).This isn't a linux or general unix book - the book has 'SOLARIS' on the cover and should reflect Solaris."
1,Don't buy if you want to learn 5.10,No solaris 5.10 stuff. Please write to author to change the title to Solaris 9 or earlier. No 5.10 stuff that I could see.
2,Vague explanations,"I was not happy with this book. I read up to chapter 6 and I got tired of it very quickly. Not enough information and very vague in most of the explanations and instructions. I will be waiting for Bill Calkins to release his Solaris 10 Administration book. So far, I think he is the best."
2,Definitely not complete!,"This book was very disappointing. Although it seems to be complete for Solaris 9, I was not able to find information about smf, inetconv and other new features of Solaris 10. I would not recommend it for Solaris 10 users or administrators."
1,This book does not cover new Solaris 10 features.,"I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this book. It is bad enough that the book is simply the old Solaris 8/9 book with a Solaris 10 cover. What makes it worse is that in many cases it cannot (should not) be used to administer Solaris 10. The information is wrong! /etc/rc.2d startup scripts are no longer used. The book discusses /etc/inetd.conf but it is no longer used. Nothing is mentioned about the new Solaris 10 features, especially the ones all system admins MUST know!"
1,Not even 1 star,"Why does a book on Solaris 10 need to cover the history of Unix, BSD origins, the shell, the kernel, USENET, mailing list, etc ... useless! This might not be a bad Solaris book, but it's not going to have much to do with Solaris 10, much less ""A complete reference"" as it proclaims itself to be. Get your reading materials from BigAdmin and save your money for a future better book on Solaris 10."
1,Don't bother,"The other reviews pretty much hit it. This book sucks. Lots of pages are wasted on networking concepts and things like Zones, D-Trace and SMF are never talked about."
1,Pretty poor,"There is basically nothing on the new Solaris 10 features. There's nothing on Service Management Facility, basically nothing on zones, no ZFS, and nothing usable about containers, just to start the list.It's also a bit dated. How dated? Check out this sentence on page 9: ""In recent years, a number of threats have emerged to the market dominance of UNIX systems: Microsoft's enterprise computing products and frameworks..."" Microsoft is an emerging threat??? Someone to watch, perhaps, might be a factor some day?I highly recommend Solaris 10. I do not recommend this book that is supposed to be about Solaris 10."
1,Terrible book,"This book is NOT about Solaris 10, as other reviewers have noted. There is absolutely nothing in this book about any feature that has been added or changed in Solaris 10. Please do not waste your money on this. Go to docs.sun.com. It's free, and you will actually learn something about Solaris 10. It really deserves zero stars."
2,"I agree. NOT a ""Complete"" Solaris 10 book.","I should have known it was probably too much to expect when it came out before the Solaris 10 certification exams were even finalized. It is certainly NOT ""The Complete Reference"" for Solaris 10, and I would recommend you wait for a more definitive book on the subject. If you can't wait, then I would recommend you lower your expectations now. As other reviewers wrote, the examples and coverage of the newer Solaris 10 features are sparse to non-existant."
1,A complete mistake,"This book not only doesn't really cover Solaris 10 but previous ones, but also is so full of mistakes, that I am really glad I had the opportunity to check it without buying."
1,Extremely disappointing...,"This is a regurgitated copy of his Solaris 9 book... It goes into no detail whatsoever on the new Solaris 10 features... ZFS, SMF, Partitioning, etc... Newcomers to solaris who read this book would have no idea about milestones, smf, etc, and would assume Solaris 10 still uses just the RC scripts to boot.From the binding: ""Includes FULL DETAILS on all the new features""... this is completely FALSE!I'm thoroughly disappointed with this book, especially considering the author's previous releases..."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This book is by no means ""The Complete Reference"" for Solaris 10, it is barely a guide to administration. It looks like they threw in a few changes for 10 but didn't even review to find out what went away or changed. The clue was in the very beginning when it still used a 'df -k' instead of the 'df -h' that was part of Solaris 9. Then it reference old hardware. Skipping to the networking, it referenced inetd.conf which is no longer directly used to configure inetd. This book is terrible. I am glad I used a coupon that covered most of the cost of this book. I can not and will not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Solaris or Unix in general CR?,"If gentle reader is looking for a generalised book on Unix with a slant towards Solaris 10, then this is okay. If however, you are looking for something more specific this would not be a good choice.It reads as more of an overview with some technical points rather than a complete reference. That is an overview that does not cover any of the new features of Solaris 10 as previously stated by another."
1,Is this really for solaris 10?,"Solaris 10 has new features like dtrace,svcadm,zones but none of this is covered in the book?? This looks like a reprint of solaris 8 with some end notes tacked on.Avoid this book;"
3,Quick Read,This was a good book for the novice with no experience in the tree industry. It was a quick read and enjoyable. But not for someone in who works in the field already.
5,Want to grow trees?,This book surpased my expectations. In one book the author drips water on dozens of aspects / facets of growing. You won't be disapointed. My goal was to grow a few tree's as Christmas presents for friends and family every year. The book made it clear what I need to do and not do. Well worth the money and time.
3,Lots to cover!!,"the book really covers a lot of ground on the trees. It is something you need to sit down and read a few times, and even go back to it for reference as you go. There's a whole lot of info crammed into sections that if you miss it and make the wrong move, you could destroy your tree crop."
2,mcfarlane manga freak,"great design and good plastic used. articulation is fair on the arms, but lacks on the knees. as a display piece, its nice, but not for posability."
2,sad derivations,"JCF's music, much like his life, is a pale imitation of what could have and should have been. It is sad that he hid behind the mask of intellect instead of expressing the deep and true emotions that he held."
4,A fun little gift,"This little purse is a great hit in our house! The purse and the little puppy are both small, which is perfect for little hands to carry. The puppy does take up a lot of space inside the purse, but there is still room for your girl to add other small little treasures into the purse. So far, the beaded handles of this purse have held up well. One drawback is that the purse doesn't close up completely. That's great for allowing the cute puppy to stick its head out, but at times it's a bit frustrating to the child who might not want other stuff to fall out."
4,Fantastic!,"Fun, slightly different variations on the ""usual"" ATS combos. Mimi explains the movements clearly and I find her body movement easy to follow. Bright, colorful and well put together."
2,I wouldn't recommend this dvd,"This DVD is frustrating because when Mimi does the combinations to music she is facing the audience, which is really difficult to follow. When she breaks the combinations down there is someone with her back to the audience so I could follow this portion fairly easily, but the majority of it is with Mimi facing the audience and it's nice to watch but for me it was not easy to follow."
5,deserves more then 5 stars!,"If you are an ATS dancer, this DVD is a must own! Mimi has put together some really nice combo's using FCBD moves as well as adding her own twist to some. This is geared towards an intermediate dancer with basic FCBD vocabulary. Mimi breaks down each move facing forward, with another dancer facing away, so you can follow along with no trouble. Each combo is demonstrated for a solo, duet and trio, with a short song drill afterwards. Some of the music is alittle repetitious, but her clear, easy to follow instruction and wonderful technique make it totally worthwhile. This DVD is lots of fun and I felt like I got quite alot out of it. I would love to see her come out with another volume!"
2,Needs Work...,"From the looks of the cover one would think there would be a great amount of detail and research within these pages. However, upon reading it you will be taken for a loss and need to refer back to the Official Records or State Regimental records.There are too many errors to list, and the 3-D terrain effect is not very helpful, but the historical snapshots are nice."
2,I would agree with the shortcomings.,"I would agree generally with those who sight shortcoming in the technology and the the explanation and add that they are confusing.Everyone is always trying to write a better description of Civil War battles, this may have some new ideas but many did not work very well."
5,Best waxing experience EVER!,I've been a Meguiars customer for 20 years and have on hand a number of their products. I usually need to use more than one product to get the desired result I'm looking for when detaily my car. I read another post about this product and decided to try it. After using a clay bar (from Meguiars) I applied the Nanowax and could not believe my eyes. Almost completely gone were swirl marks and some etchings from tree sap and bugs. The gloss returned to a new look and felt incredible. I have never experienced this kind of transformation without using 2 or more products beyond the clay bar. It saved me lots of time and this product is extremely easy to use. I used Meguiars swirl remover #9 and also a polish and could not get the same result as with one application of the nanowax.
5,"Love this, but the Gel Wax...","I love the Nanowax, but the new Gel Wax is a messy, sticky mess to get off. Don't go hog wild and buy a lot of Gel Wax without trying it first..."
5,Brilliant Shine,Eagle one nano wax is probably one of the best waxes I have ever used. It has a brilliant deep glossy shine and beads very nicely. I personally think that this synthetic wax is much better than any carnuba wax. I highly recommend it.
4,Good Wax,"I found this to be a very good wax. It did not, however, remove all the scratches from my car. On the plus side of the product, I think the only thing that will remove the scratches will have to be an auto buffer. I'm satisfied with the product as advertised."
5,"I love this wax, wished they still had it easily available locally",Having tried all the waxes/polishes/etc that you can get from your local auto parts stores this one is my favorite and I was terribly sad when it couldn't be located anymore.It does a superb job with micro marring/light spider-webbing and it lasts a decent amount of time. Easy to apply and remove and it applies evenly. It doesn't provide a super deep/wet look but given all the positives it is a wonderful product and handily beats the other competitors at or below it's price point.
2,"No, No Wax.","No, no... and no! This wax does not help remove swirl marks as it claims! Works just like any other wax; easy to apply and difficult to buff. Not a significant gummy or powdery residue, but it's just like you had not waxed at all. No significant improvement to your car. Black Magic is a far batter alternative."
5,Excellent devotion book!,My wife read this book as a child and enjoyed it so much that she wanted to buy several copies to share with our Grandchildren and others. We would recommend this book. You will not be disappointed.
2,Playin' to Win/Ghost Riders [IMPORT],"I've been an Outlaws fan and supporter since I first saw them in concert back in 1975. As most of you know, the ""Ghost Riders"" CD has been out of print for quite a few years and ""Playin' To Win' has never offically been released on CD. The excitement of having ""Playin To Win"" on CD quickly vanished upon listening to it. Outlaw fans beware, this CD (at least the ""Playin' To Win"" tracks) are not from the original master tapes. If you listen carefully, you can tell an album was used as the source. Soyou have a remastered version from an LP. Talk about feeling ripped-off.I agree with the other review, the vocals are distorted, especially when the letter ""S"" is involved in any phrase. If you do not own a copy of the album ""Playin to Win"" or the Ghost Riders CD, then go for it. If you already own Playin' To Win on LP,and Ghost Riders on CD, save your money."
5,Playin to Win / Ghost Riders By The Outlaws,"On the contrary to the other reviews on this cd, yes it is Remastered BUT my cd that i recieved of this was in crystal clear digital audio and sounded great, after reading the other reviews i expected to recieve a crappy cd , so i am happy to report that it is a great cd with great sound, it's really good to hear these 2 albums all cleaned up in digital format."
1,Forgettable,"With Playin' To Win, the Outlaws' winning streak came to a grinding halt. Compared to the first thee albums, the material is unremarkable and the arrangements bland. There's simply nothing to distinguish this album, other than ""Falling Rain"", with vocals that sound uncannily like Ronnie Van Zant.Unfortunately, the CD sound quality renders a poor album virtually unlistenable. As someone else has already noted, every ""s"" sound is overly-sibilant."
5,great CD,"I'm a big fan of Paul O'Dette - I stumbled on vol. 4 of his ""Complete Works of John Dowland"" in a used record store a while back and have been enchanted with lute music ever since.The Royal Lewters is a collection of Tudor-era lute music: lots of charming pieces by little-known composers, and for many of the selections the composer isn't known. There is a surprising amount of variety here, many different tempos, moods, etc., everything from cheerful little dance-like tunes to more solemn, introspective pieces and laments. The recorded sound is excellent, nice and spacious."
1,Fantasy is dead.,"It only took 30 pages to realize this novel was going to be yet another tired imitation of the fantasy quest formula. The 600+ pages that followed simply supported that realization. Some reviewers have stated ""yes, it was cliched but it had some twists!"" A. No, it really didn't. B. Even with ""twists"" it is a tired, unoriginal story filled with laughably wooden archetypical characters that it is difficult to give a fig about."
1,"Eldon, get a new editor!","Basically, I agree with the comments of earlier reviews. This is not a good book. It is formulaic, cliched, and has nothing to say. Worse, it has all these faults spread over 712 pages, a very great deal of which should have been cut out from the endless pages of needless descriptions and pointless dialogueI read a lot of fantasy, much of it poor. Mr. Thompson seems like a writer whose editor needs to be given a stern talking-to about permitting a reasonably good new writer to clutter up a decent plot and unobjectionable characters with simply acres and acres of useless baggage. I usually love long books. I couldn't wait for this one to end. Literally. I quit on page 576. Did I miss the good stuff?"
2,Nothing orginal,"While this book feels rather light a breezy and is easy to read, it utterly lacks anything orginal to merit it's length."
1,I wish i had my money back.,"Sadly i bought both book one and book 2 of this series at the same time. I have never bailed out of a book before so this is the first, i stuck with it through page 500 but i will not continue. I have wasted time reading it."
4,Quest based fantasy at its best,"This is not George RR Martin, Robin Hobb or Scott Bakker folks. This is Eldon Thompson, and the Crimson Sword is a cleverly written throwback to the classic quest based fantasy books of old. What makes The Crimson Sword stand out, in my opinion, is the fantastic character development. Jarom is an entirely sympathetic character and I very much felt attached to his story. Meanwhile, Allion, Kylac and Marisha are all well written and believable supporting characters. The battle scenes are breath taking and took me by pleasant surprise. But the heart of the story lies with young Jarom, who must battle fate itself."
3,Honey they blew up the kids,Gah how can you review a book without spoiling too much (any) content!Well what is said by a lot of peoples and it goes for me also is that this author writes very well in terms of his use of the English language... but in my opinion has a tough time capturing any true depth of characters.It really seemed to have a lack of worthwhile dialogue. Sure there were some talking parts between characters but where did it actually develope a character's own sense? Is Allion a fun loving guy? Does Torin have a great sense of humor? Is Allion's humor more sarcastic then Torin's? Can torin be playful even around danger? I have no clue. Maybe not the best examples but things that would make the character a little less 2D would be nice.I wouldn't recommend this series tbh but I have read worse.
4,Fun and Creative Play,Very good book that teaches kids and parents how to make toys that are fun and creative. From the tire swing to the home made barrometer instructions are easy and educational. My kids didn't stop when the book was totally consumed. They began making their own toys and performing their own experiments.
2,superfriends,this dvds is from the late 70 and it should be left there the action in this dvd is slow and lame the story are weak. also the creator trying to explain what he was thinking is lame instead of talking about the charters and showing more action this dvd should be left on the self unless you want to go down memory lane leave it wher it is.
1,they screwd this one really bad,"I bought this video because I belived it had a lot of information concerning the bands in it even it was somewhat akcward to find THIN LIZZY in the list I belived the rest of the bands had a common ground.Its just like some other customer wrote they cut the videos and put some interview(piece of it)and they dont either play the whole damn video neither the whole damn interviews,so whats the point?And to make things worse they cut the TESTAMENT interview and it basically doesn`t have the end,so you are gonig to basically watch a DVD that just cuts the ending.But if youre stuborn and feel the need to see for your self,go ahead and be my guess."
2,not this one,"I have taken this brand of Melatonin in the past but it has its limitations. I fell asleep with ease but was awake after two hours. Taking 2 tablets promotes more sleep but also leaves me with a headache the next day. If this is the only brand you have tried, you are in for a surprise when you chose a Melatonin that is time released."
3,Nature's Bounty brand seems better,"I started taking Melatonin a couple months back to help regulate my sleep (due to a recent job with a Midnight schedule). This Natrol's was the first brand I tried. It seemed to work OK, but it was really hard to swallow, as they're raterh porous and light weight (seemed to stick to my tongue and ""float"" on the water I drank to assist in swallowing). I also had to double up on the dosage. I was taking two 3mg tablets, and only getting OK resaults. I switched to Nature's Bounty (price is similar) and had way better luck. I only need one pill, and they're much easier to swallow. Melatonin does improve the quality of sleep I get with no real side effects, but this brand wasn't as good as I had hoped."
5,the only time to use pampers,"I've tried a few differnt things for my son, in the beginning I hated huggies and loved these, as time has gone on I found newborn stage is the best and only time for pampers, the rest of the time huggies has saved the day (and kept leaks away). Pampers are PERFECT for the first stage (only)."
3,Depends on the baby,"I have 4 children and with all of them I have had to change brands of diapers. Some babies maybe alergic to something in them and it is best not to register for alot of the same brand diapers. Huggies has been a winner in our household, as is their wipes"
4,this is an ok brand,im 14 and i was helping my sister out with her new daughter and i suggested buying these well i guess i was wrong on the picture they said there was a cut-out well there wasnt but overall this is a great product and i would recommened it to anyone who loves pampers
5,Great Diapers,I am breast feeding my daughter and have had no problems. These diapers are great. Will use again for my next child.
5,we love this !!!,compared to huggies. the strechable part is wonderful !!!!no leaks at all. the only question is why amazon's price is $2 more than target's down the street ?
5,THE BEST THERE IS!!,"I think I have tried almost EVERY diaper there is and thus far...Pampers is always #1 to me and my husband as well as our children who have to wear them. We find that our experience with Pampers is much better than the other brands available. Tried Luvs (same as Pampers Baby Dry but a cheaper version, both made by Proctor & Gamble), tons of store brands (A&P, Shop-Rite, CVS, Walgreens and so on), Huggies Supreme and Baby-Shaped/Ultra-Trim, Playskool, and White Cloud...just to name a few. Pampers holds the most amount of urine than the others which leads to less leakage. I can't say we never had leaks. We have had a few diapers leak overnight, but our 2 sons are heavy wetters. Pampers holds up the best for our 2 boys. Added bonuses Pampers offers is the great powdery smell and the soft cloth like cover and the stretchy sides. Yeah they maybe the most expensive on the market, but they sure are worth it!! I save by purchasing them on sale and use coupons so I get double the savings."
2,not our favorite,"We used these when we first brought our baby home from the hospital, and they just never fit her right! She was 9lbs when she was born, and the diapers just never fit her legs well. We switched to huggies and haven't looked back. They work much better and don't have that weird smell the pampers have."
4,A better choice for your newborn,"After four children, I feel I've had some experience with disposable diapers. For newborns, Pampers wins hands down for one main reason: the cut-out that fits around the umbilical cord. The Huggies newborn diapers simply fold down away from the cord, and with active wrigglers the fold pops back up and causes irritation to this tender area. The cut-away on the Pampers newborn diapers keep the diaper material away from the cord area, so your baby has a better chance of healing more quickly. That being said, after the newborn size I've always switched over to Huggies. My kids (and I) have preferred Huggies for their fit around the legs and waist, their softness, and their absorbency."
1,"Leaks, leaks, leaks","I can't believe Pampers are selling these diapers for our tinest consumers and put them through misery, Pampers should have withdrawn it from the market. I bought these diapers for my newborn son and now I'm so sorry for him. The diaper leaks through his back and every time I change him, I have to change his clothes, his blanket and his sheet. I have to buy Huggies and they seem to be doing a better job in keeping my son dry."
2,Not the Best Diapers for Newborns,"We love Pampers diapers and are using them now because of their superior absorbancy, but I have to tell you that when our two children were newborns that the Pampers Size ""N"" did not fit them very well. My daughter was on the tubby side while my son was on the skinny side and neither was serviced well by these diapers.It was not so much a poopy problem for us, but a leak at night time problem which, lets face it, is no fun.My advice is to try Huggies first for your newborn, and to use Pampers for every size 1 and above."
2,Smelly diapers,"I'm not sure if it's just my son but whenever we use these dipers he smells bad, like chemicals. We don't have the problem with any other dipers. But at the same time We never had a problem with the swaddlers leaking"
5,"The best N diaper, period. Don't waste your time with Huggies.","Our hospital used these, and we compared at home. Huggies were terrible! They proved to be poorly fitted (essentially straight, with little leg contouring) and leaky as can be. A disaster. We simply threw the rest of them out they were so worthless. By contrast, the pampers fit well, can be easily folded out of the way of the umbilical stump, and have never leaked. They are also quite compact--an added bonus. Our newborn is of average size and weight."
4,ARRRGGGHHH,I am so ticked off that this book was not better than it was. I was wanting so much more!!!! It just really pissed me off.Just kidding It was really very helpful.
1,RUBBISH - DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Please dont buy this DVD and waste your money.It comes wrapped up in cling film!!!! That set the alarm bells ringing.Then the DVD has been filmed on a low resolution camera buy someone on the balcony of the show.The picture is grainy, you cant see the peoples faces its so unclear and the music does not match the movements.All in all this looks like a private person who video'd and thought they would sell it on Amazon. If its an official production as it says then it is the single worst dance DVD I have ever seen.I have not exaggerated this review. Do yourself a favour and buy something else."
5,"Great read, easy, useful",The book outlines programs that are actually being used in schools. Very helpful. This is a best guide for application.
1,Useless if you own a mac,"Included CD is not mac compatible. Therefore, cannot access the programs. It also talks about an updated software that never apparently happened. Waste of money."
4,Holmes is still not pulling punches!,"Larry Holmes never received the respect he deserved for his accomplishments in the boxing ring, and this book gives the reader a look at the entire path which he took to becoming champion.From fight for $150 purses early in his career, to being robbed out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by Don King, to having a fight against Michael Spinks stolen from him, this book will help the Holmes admirer and detractor better understand how he had to battle to become and stay a champion. The book also gives the reader an insight into the seediness of boxing and the personalities.Very good read for the fight fan."
4,Good read but skips over important fights,"This was a good read about an important fighter, the man who very nearly became the heavyweight champion with the best winning record.Larry's story is interesting and while there may have been a touch of self-aggrandishment throughout, he did not overdo it. I think that he could have gone into more detail about certain fights eg vs Tyson, and he could have discussed the life of a champion outside of the ring more than he did, but these are minor quibbles while looking at the book overall.A good read."
5,BRUTALLY HONEST AS ALWAYS,"this is a must, even if you dont like larry.his stories of his ongoing, at times surreal wars with don king are hilarious and the most compelling parts of the book, and his accounts of his early years and the weird characters that inhabit boxing, like the huge, strange, surly ex-cons Roy ""Tiger"" Williams and Jeff Merritt are fascinating. His long car journey up to Scranton, alone at night with the deranged Merritt in the passenger seat is bizarre in the extreme!the one problem is occasionally he skims over important world title defences with no more than a one line account of the fight. this is very frustrating.overall though i put this book in the same class as george foremans ""by george"", joe fraziers ""smokin"" and quick tillis's ""thinkin big""(all highly enjoyable)and is superb. buy it, and enjoy larrys brutal honesty!!(and sense of humour)"
5,Holmes scores knockout!,"World Champion Larry Holmes recounts his life inside and outside of the ring in his fascinating autobiography. This book is not some former champion hoping to make his life read like a movie script. It is a down to earth story that many sports fans can relate to. Larry pulls no punches in describing his feelings in his personal life and his professional life. It is a captivating account of this mans life and what it took to not only win the championship, but defend it so successfully. Full of humor and unabashed honesty, one comes away with a newfound respect for Larry and his many accomplishments. A lively and engaging read, ""Against the Odds"" is the perfect name for the life and career of Larry Holmes."
4,Holmes' success is no fluke.,"Against the Odds by Larry Holmes was a good read. I have always admired Larry. He made his money without the hype and pagantry surrounding most Olympic amateurs. The secret to Larry's success was that he kept winning. He was the best of his time. He was smart enough to know that during his peak production years, he had to save his money. And, as it was with Larry, it was his nature, as revealed in the book, when as a kid, to realize the value of saved money.This book was well written and fun to read. I read it is a couple of sessions. It is well worth its cost."
3,"Five stars for the illustrations; two stars for the clumsy, syntax-deficient writing","My kids really like this book -- it's original and engaging. Having said that -- I often make up my own words to the pictures because the original words are so awful in places. In order to preserve a rigid rhyme scheme, Wheeler mixes up verb tenses, tosses out definite articles, and generally makes a chopped salad out of the English language in her attempts at wit. Maybe the words were supposed to be set to music? Whenever I read it I get the sense that something's missing or just wrong with the way the words go together. I would love to see anything else by this illustrator (Ponder Goembel)."
4,[snort laugh],"Oh, my stars. Yo-Ho-Ho-and a shiver-me-be.It happens to coincide with Talk-Like-a-Pirate Day, and this book is hilarious. It is full of puns and a great rhyme scheme. It's fun to get my language-arts-deficient child to write two or three scenes in this rhyme scheme. He imagined they opened an all-you-can-eat cheese buffet (puffy, guppy). And a laser-operated kite shop. (?? He's a guy.) And a laser-guided robot missile ship. (I know. Lasers, huh?)Lisa Wheeler does it better. Your family will enjoy this book."
5,5 Stars - This book will stand the test of time for picture books,"This book is highly recommended.Even though there are only a few negative reviews (old ones), I still wanted to comment. Yes there are tricky or more difficult words, for a good reason. Lisa's words and rhythm serve a good purpose - helping children learn new words, rhythm of language, and FUN reading a book (priceless). This is an outstanding picture book and the language is what makes it sing. It is a rhyming book and will not use conventional sentence structure (it does not have to for this format). It is also fun for role play with groups of children. It is excellent for kids; it encourages their vocabulary and language development. I have personally used it in several teaching and daycare environments. A lovely and worthwhile book from one of the best rhyming picture book writers today. 5 Stars."
3,Disappointing First Monograph on Johanson,"The publishers of this small book/exhibition catalogue on the fine work of Chris Johanson should be ashamed of themselves. The incredibly poor quality of the majority of the images is unforgivable in an art book. A good many of the reproductions are so bad as to almost be unreadable, which is a crime since much of Johanson's work contains text. This is the fault of the publisher, not Johanson; whomever did the photographic reproductions should lose their job for doing such a crummy job and delivering such a sad publication on a very good, young contemporary artist. Aaron Rose's short essay is nice, but also not enough to save this book. I would honestly suggest buying other books featuring Johanson's work (like Beautiful Losers) before spending money on this one."
1,This is an awful book of Chris Johanson artwork,"Sorry to repeat the review below, but i want to emphasize how correct he is. THis book is awful. The reproductions are poor quality. The colors look faded. You cannot read the text in the paintings!!!!!! It looks like (and i think it is) printed using [...] or something. I actually returned my book, and i almost never do that. Don't waste your money. Get ""Please Listen I Have Something to Tell You About What Is"" and don't waste any more time worrying about this piece of crap. This book must be very embarassing to Deitch Projects."
2,HEIGHTS,wow...wasn't moved by this melodrama...glenn close and the rest of the cast give great but forgetable performances
4,An intense day in New York,"I had never heard of this film but it was recommended to me by my on-line DVD service based on what I rented, so I thought I'd give it a go. And I am glad I did.Following one day in the life of a number of people in New York, Diana and her daughter Isabel in particular [everyone else is linked to them], while the plot is nothing too unusual, the performances by all are simply so superb and heartfelt [showing forth and recalling the passion Diana demanded of her acting class at the beginning], that I was hooked. By the end, I had been taken on a most exciting adventure, and was sad to see that it ended -- I could've kept watching. But then there is something to be said to leaving the future to the imagination."
3,"Another script about being actors, ugh ....","This is another movie containing a subplot about actors and theater etc, with the usual scenes within scenes. One of my pet peeves because writers seem to think acting and movies etc are so fascinating that they make cinematic material. Um, not really. But the film is actually ok, just not as intriguing as you might assume, given the many personal entanglements. The problem is they don't even begin to make sense until at least halfway in, and you might lose patience before then."
2,"""Don't buy this particular model""!!",Within not even 5 days the carbon tip already broke off on one of the sticks. And of course my return window expired in reference to a manufactures defect.
5,Surfing on the Internet,"This book should be supplied to all users of the web. It gives one of the best views of an addicts use to the medium. From the first tentative steps, all the way through to over load! The author MUST be praised for her writing, and content.A DEFINATE MUST!"
2,Pretty woman,"Purchase experience from Amazon - 4.I have put five strips of Hitachi 3x.120 ring shank HDG nails through my new NR90GR. I liken the experience to a Pretty woman___who is celibate. It looks good, feels good but doesn't satisfy.I was nailing standard pine 2x4's together and without fail every nail was left standing a half inch or more. I had to finish the task by hand. The depth was set to max penetration and I tried different new fuel sticks. I am in Miami so temp and elevation is not a factor.I have left email with Hitachi support, still waiting a reply. If they offer meaning full help, I'll follow up this review."
4,Adapt,"I've had this unit for 2 weeks now, doing some roof and wall framing. Granted, it doesn't bump fire like an air nailer, but that's not a requirement for me as I'm a methodical type, so an extra 10-seconds to nail off a row of studs is not an issue. The gun works well, is plenty powerful, the 3-1/2 inch ring shank limitation is known, so I work within its capabilities. I find you have to teach yourself the right amount of pressure it takes to enable firing, and I don't give it a second thought now. VERY pleased with the convenience of no hose and 40-lb compressor to lug upstairs."
1,Doing the Hitachi name wrong,"I've been a framing contractor in Ca for over 18 years and I have never been dissappointed with Hitachi. It's notorious for great, dependable products. Not so with the NR90GR nailer. Terrible! The gun had been a bust right out of the box. It didn't even get through one strip of nails. It just won't shoot. If you have the skills and the timing of a jungle cat that's been trained by a ninja, you might get it to fire! I thought this was going to be a sweet little tool that could save me a lot of time on the job. I was wrong and as a consequence very dissappointed. I've replaced the gas rod multiple times, I've charged the battery, I've taken it to a tool repair twice, and it still doesn't work. I'm sticking to the hoses until Hitachi comes out with a new and improved model."
3,cordless nailer,"I need to have cordless nailer for line of work...I used to have a Pasload it was agravatingly unreliable...This one does not appear to be a whole lot better. You must have patience when using these tools, but they are definatly handy when needed."
4,Temperamental Nail Gun,"I've had some intermittent difficulty with this gun since I purchased it where it would just quit working. I'd read a comment somewhere where someone switched over to Paslode brand cartridges (Red) so I tried it. Gun now is working consistently whereas before, I'd have to take out the Hitachi cartridge, press the gas nozzle down a few times, reinsert and continue on.Now it's working great. Still have to press the tip sort of hard before it will fire but it fires everytime.So, if you are having problems with the thing just stopping working for no reason, try the Paslode red cartridges. They are dated whereas the Hitachi are not and it appears that the valve is slightly different.So my rating is a 4 on the gun itself. Love the flexibility of not being connected to an air hose. Knocking off a point for the small magazine, being heavy, and requiring a lot of tip pressure to fire. The Hitachi fuel cells get a 2 out of 5."
1,Not a good buy.,"If your looking for a cordless nailgun that costs more to operate in 2 months than you paid, then you've found your gun.I got a average of 200 nails per gas cylinder (they claim 1200) at a cost of $13 a pop. I actually went through four cylinders in one day. I have two paslode framing guns and thought i would try an Hitachi.I am a builder an use these guns all the time. But this Hitachi has been in the repair shop for two months. I think im going to leave it there."
1,"Very, very disappointed","I had hoped this would be a great tool for small projects, but it turned out to be a great disappointment. I was able to drive 8 (eight) nails in standard 2x4x8 after which the tool stopped working.With a fully charged battery I thought the fuel cell might have been from a bad stock, so I replaced it, but with the same result. Being optimistic, I bought a new set of Hitachi fuel cells, but that didn't change anything.I have followed the procedures outlined in the Troubleshooting section of the Manual but the tool refuses to work.I have been using power, and pneumatic tools for a long time, but this one got me :(Probably Hitachi should revise their testing procedure, at least for this tool, to ensure its reliability.I hope Amazon will accept a return for the nailer, but I ended up with a box of nails and two sets of fuel cells for a total of almost $100 lost money!!!"
3,"good in the right conditions, moneysaver for homeowners","This is essential for sites without power when you can't use a gas powered compressor, or when hose management presents too much of a problem, but when conditions aren't right it can really be frustrating. I've only fired about 10,000 nails through it, but I bought it used and it still works fine. I'm surprised how fast I can lay down decking with this, It doesn't have a bump mode but it's about the same speed as an air nailer powered by a 120 volt compressor running nonstop.It can get finicky below 35 degrees or above 80. The worst thing is it's much harder to press down than an air nailer, at long reaches a hammer is easier. In cold temps, this only gets worse and sometimes it doesn't fire so you waste a lot of effort. However, this limitations aside, it can be used to complete entire projects."
1,Did not work. Nails would not feed.,"The Hitachi NR90GR that I purchased looked great but did not work. It would not feed nails. I returned it and purchased another higher priced, higher quality nailer."
1,Pure bilge,"Farmers Brothers coffee you say? Pure bilge, cheap, vile, acrid, under-roasted, touched with a certain percentage of robusta, real crap, appealing to people who have no taste."
5,coffee just like restaurants use,"This is the same stuff most restaurants use, at least in the western USA. good stuff, consistent."
5,coffee,This coffee is the best. I like the part where there is no after taste. Just pure goodness to the last drop
1,terrible mill,when i got this item it has worn-out damage.replace item condition is even worse than 1st.something oder and blue mold(i think) and another one stainless steel is scraggy surface. i can't trust this product.
2,Not really a music video after all!!,"I love the Goo Goo Dolls and I bought tis video from Juneau, Alaska, the perfect video? No, not really. It's more of a documentary about Alaska, which includes a couple of bad acoustic renditions of a few of their tunes! I guess if you're a really big fan then go ahead and buy, but if's it's live music you want then ignore this!"
3,good scenery..music good,"Been a fan of Goo Goo dolls for awhile and considered them to be at times on the cutting edge with songs like ""slide"" ""broadway"" ""black baloon"" and ""Acoustic 3 "" all of which are on here in a acoustic way. John Rzeznik does most of the commentary and its set in alaska which provides some unbelievable scenery. This is not your bang them up GGD but reflective pieces especially with John on appreciation of where they have come from. Its a good dvd for sitting with your significant other to enjoy a short version of 40 minutes of 7 songs, but was looking for alittle more... Not disapointed to have it"
3,Disappointing DVD Quality,I watched these Music in High Places series on Satellite when they originally were airing them and really loved them. I had hopes they would be released on DVD so i could watch them on my widescreen in high resolution in glorious 16x9 aspect ratio. Unfortunetly whomever produced these DVD's kept them letterboxed in 4:3 ratio and the only way i can watch them widescreen is to zoom in on the picture using my TV's zoom capability. This of course ruins the picture quality.. Very disappointing that they couldn't produce this series properly on DVD so we could truly see the gorgous backdrops while listening to our favorite bands. The music and content of the DVD itself is excellent and i would recommend it highly if you have an older 4:3 television.
5,Beautiful Scenery-Alaska & Johnny & Robbie,"There's a point in the show where John says something about having to perform death-defying tricks to get people to buy CD's nowadays and he's right, it works. I wasn't a fan until I caught a freeview of this on direct tv. Now I'm a huge fan. My son now makes me play Gutterflower constantly, he loved this DVD too. I saw them at Atlantic City live and now I can't wait to see them again. I also want to go to Alaska now, it wasn't a destination for me before. I'd walk there from NJ if I could go mud surfing with John, Yum! Sorry, you gotta see it to know what I'm talking about. That alone is worth the money."
3,Garbage cover standout track,"This album is worth getting for the incredibly majestic and energy pumped into the Garbage song ""Only Happy When it Rains"". The song takes on a bluesy, powerful rock anthem that blows the original t a mythical level. This song becomes a classic thru Nicklebag."
4,Foam Wedge Review,The wedge was a gift to my Mom. She likes it very much. It is a bit hard but nothing a pillow can't fix.
4,Adobe CS2,"Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in. Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard. The zoom out ""-"" in the number pad still works, but not the plus. I say that's not good.Why ruin things with an upgrade."
5,Buy this single,"This single is soon to be featured in the retro-Nineties epic film, '17 Minutes Past Midnight.' As such, it is likely to become a hot collectors item."
5,Wonderful to read and re-read,"I read the first of these books when I was in 7th grade. It took me two years to locate a copy of the 2nd book and two more to find the 3rd. It was well worth the wait and I stayed up all night to read the final book. The characters are wonderfully crafted, the story line is multilevel. The only books I have read more times are ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"". If you can locate a copy of these in a used book store, buy them! Don't let the romance novel apperance keep you from enjoying these great books."
3,Answer to question,"Do you mean the song played during the wedding scene at the end? If so, it's Sheryl Crow and the song is called ""I Shall Believe"". I found it on the Roswell Soundtrack."
3,Response to Question..,"Elizabeth - I know what song you're talking about and I also am surprised it did not make it onto the CD, it is ""I Shall Believe"" by Sheryl Crow and it played during the wedding scene.I loved that song and wish it had made it onto the soundtrack, but I fell in love even more with Richie Haven's, ""Follow"". Good soundtrack and the movie was really enjoyable also."
3,I loved the music from the movie,"There are some tunes that I had never heard before including a Cheryl Crow tune at the end that, unfortunately, did not make it to the cd. My three star rating is a result of a producer that evidently picked music he liked to add to the cd (or maybe just checked the box for 9 songs radomly) without including songs that I would have much preferred be added. Richie Haven's ""Follow"" is an exceptionally good addition to not only the movie but the soundtrack."
3,question,This is a good collection of styles but there is one song that is missing from the soundtrack. It played during a depressing scene. It is a slow song with a woman singing and the chorus is 2 female voices harmonizing. I have heard this song many times but do not know who it is. If anyone knows please post it.
5,Rocky Gause--One of a Kind,"Rocky Gause, an Army pilot without a plane, made a wartime escape from the Japanese that was remarkable. His accounting of the day to day adventure is also remarkable. The story, in his own handwriting, was a family treasure until a few years ago, when Rocky's son was asked by his mother to see if it could be published for others to read. Rocky Gause had gone back to war, but this time he didn't return. His story was left as a gift to future generations. If Rocky had returned he might have been a writer--the story is that good. I am an aviation writer myself."
5,"An exciting, gripping adventure. Don't miss it!","Damon J. Gause should become America's newest hero. His tale of escape from the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in WWII is a true adventure of the first rank. Along with Captain Osborne, his only companion, the two sailed in a rickety boat over three thousand miles to Austrailia, surviving storms, starvation, sharks and the Japanese Navy. This is a tale of true heroism, patriotism, and love of family, that will captivate every American. We need more heroes like Gause and Osborne. Their story tells of an age we never want to forget."
4,"An exciting record of adventure, courage and sacrifice","I couldn't put down this book. As a World War II history buff, and having lived in the Philippines as a young child, I was fascinated with Rocky Gause's escape from the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in 1942.Gause attributed his successful escape to the Filippinos who helped him along the way. He acknowledged their courage and sacrifice in not only helping him, but in fighting for freedom. I have always considered Filippinos to be the friendliest people in the world. No doubt, their willingness to help soldiers like Gause stems from wonderful and powerful attribute.I hope that more people read this book. Gause's record, along with the history of the Philippines in World War II, is one that needs to be heard."
1,"Incredible, yes...as in ""not credible""","If half of this stuff actually happened, I would be the most surprised man on earth. I've read a great deal about WWII and this story smells like bologna to me. Had I approached the book as fiction I would have enjoyed it much more. Knowing that it was written as a first person account you aren't expecting Hemingway, but Gause managed to take exciting events and make them rather dull."
5,An old book - but a real GEM!,"I picked up my book years ago. I read it cover to cover, and it revolutionized my thoughts and action plan for getting hired. It is well written, and packed with lean, mean and to the point advice. It is written from experience and is a very important work. Now, today it might be a little dated, but the writing style and the way it is laid out are timeless. I have read this book over four times, and each time I read it I learn a little bit more. It is an excellent work, and I would recommend it to anyone who is wiching to change careers or look for a new position."
4,A book to help you succeed on paper at anything,"The Robert Half Way to Get Hired in Today's Job Market is one of the most useful books you'll ever own. Mr. Half gives the reader help all the way through he hiring process -- how to write a resume, cover letter, how to prepare for a job interview, what to say in the thank-you note. By far, the most valuable part of the book, however, is his word lists that help put ""the sell"" in your resume. Besides working for resumes and cover letters, I have used these lists to help me write recomendation letters. Our copy is battered and worn and very well-used. Buy this book. It is an excellent reference."
3,"Okay 6, dreadful 3","Why would anybody sell two CDs for only 25 cents? Because the performances are pretty rough. Actually, the Pathetique is not that bad. Abravanel was a very fine conductor and a legend in Utah. He knew how to conduct a warhorse such as the Pathetique and this performance is enjoyable. However, there are many other recordings of this great masterwork that are just as good or much better. The 3rd Symphony receives a really bad performance, mainly due to poor playing. The Utah players simply could not handle this very difficult piece. If you only want the Pathetique and refuse to pay more than a quarter plus shipping, go ahead and buy it. But I would look elsewhere."
4,Coosa takes its place!,This is a good read! For the first time I realize just how important this Chiefdom was. Coosa was a huge influence on the southeastern Indian cultures.
1,stinks,these CD's are an insult to Andre Rieu. Poorest quality I have ever heard. I would not spend ther money to return them to you. DENON CD's are far superior to these.Can't figure how you could offer them.
2,Lacking Quality,"I have purchased numerous CD's and DVD of Andre Reiu and his marvelous orchestra. I am very disappointed with this CD, because of the lack of quality. The music was poorly recorded and seemingly, at times, one song over laped another. I always fine his products of high quality, but this one fell far below his other products."
5,Good Bags!,These bags work well. I use the shop vac a lot around the house and gargage. These bags handle fine dust extremely well and are pretty strong.
2,Seriously flawed Liberal Attack on the Pentagon,"Mr. Carroll should stick to fiction which he does very well. His Jesuit background overrides his reporting in this seriously flawed book. His depiction of Leslie Groves as the ""father of the atomic bomb"" is simply wrong. LTG Groves was the builder of the facilities for research, manufacturing and testing of the bombs....neither the nuclear energy science nor the subsequent application policies in the years that followed.Mr. Carroll's Catholic upbringing and his priest training simply influences his work too much and does not allow unbiased writing needed in his books if they are to be taken as serious historical documents. The only thing substantive about this book is its length....gosh, it is so redundant and repetitive I had to keep looking back to see when I read what!"
1,An American Apoligist,"Through this ambitious book, James Carroll has established himself as the undisputed captain of American apologists. In this tedious and sometimes uneven narration he manages to ascribe a dark purpose to even the most benevolent acts of American charity. Can anyone consent to the notion, as Carroll argues, that the Marshall Plan that followed World War II was an over act of aggression against the Soviet Union?In order to agree with Carroll one must subscribe to the author's bizarre belief that every American administration from the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt was corrupted by the Pentagon and that America has, for the last sixty years, represented the dark side of the universe. This is a lesson in revisionist history."
1,"Its a good laugh, but don't waste your money","If your a liberial this book is great for your bashing America, Its full of liberial ideology.It doesn't matter that most of the facts are wrong, but if you study history and look at it objectively your will realize the author is just pulling things out of thin air and twisting facts without any factual knowledge just to suport his thesis, calling it revisionist history. After a good laugh I found it sad that there are so many people out there doing things that they are not qualified for and just don't have the decency to stop as well as there are people that believe everything they read just to support there ideology."
4,House of War,"This lengthy history of the Pentagon is most interesting for pointing out how the Soviet threat was exaggerated for years so the Pentagon could command a large slice of the budget. That is particularly interesting today because the Bush administration is doing the same thing with the war of terror. The nuclear threat, so terrifying years ago with humanity destroying numbers of missiles pointed at one another, has broken a out again because of our own threats to the rest of the world."
5,This book is very useful for learning English,I am an international student. I think this book helps me doing better in writing coz it's got many synonyms and antonyms. Another good thing about the book is that every word has it's own example (telling me where in sentence i should put this word and how i should use it). It's a pretty useful.
4,discusses business issues; especially concerning privacy,"As Sun gropes around for a next Big Thing in technology, this book tries to suggest that RFID might be it. The text is written at a management level of discussion. You do not need to be in IT hardware or software to benefit from the book's explanations.The authors discuss the business implications of RFID deployment. Not just in the background of a supply chain, but also at a mass consumer level. To wit, there is a careful airing of the privacy issues that might arise if RFID tags can be used for tracking people and their purchases. And different countries have different policies towards these issues.The conclusion is broadly positive for an eventual ubiquitous deployment. Prudently, the authors desist from suggesting when that might be."
3,Better hands-on experience,"You can find a lot of written stuff about RFID on the Internet for free. When you try playing with the real readers and tags and try to write your own RFID application it becomes clear that the practice is far behind the theory. A narrow (and inexpensive) shortcut for matching both is so called ""PIRF"" (platform independent radio frequency API). It is Java based and runs on both Windows and Linux platforms. The Lite version comes with some of TI developers Kits. There are some examples on how to use it and it works fine with a number of RFID readers (mostly TI ). Anyways, it is useful for you first clash with RFID to have it on your side."
2,Disappointing,"The information presented in this book is very basic and entry level for those who have not a clue about RFID. All information are available almost every where on the internet, they just gathered them in a book form. The book explains stuff that every body knows when implementing a technical project, like selecting vendors, implementing projects, etc.Recomended only for those who have never implemented a technical project (not even RFID)."
5,Cd & Seller Are Great....,"When I purchased this item I was looking for a certain song. I normally wouldn't order a cd or tape with just Amy Grant on it. However I like this one. I asked the seller a question and she was so great. What a way to purchase, From someone who will be honest with you and give you the info you request without making you wait. I'd buy from her anytime again if she had what I was looking for."
5,Simply the best!,"This is my very favorite Christmas CD. Even the unknown songs just touch your heart, listen to the words,,,,,especially Touch of Heaven. This CD is magical"
5,This one will stand the test of time...,As others have mentioned...one reviewer even a professional recording engineer...this album is one of the most beautifully sung and arranged Christmas recordings of the last 25 years. I knew it was highly regarded and I completely see why. The arrangements are lush and Amy makes you feel like you're hearing songs you're familiar with for the first time. This album will be among the Christmas classics that have lasted like Nat King Cole's Christmas recording as well as those by Andy Williams.
4,Not Just For Amy Grant Fans,"I'm pretty finicky about Christmas albums. I hate most of them. This one is probably in my top 5, and I'm not even much of an Amy Grant fan. It's one of those extremely rare Christmas albums by a popular artist that actually sounds like Christmas. The arrangements are very traditional without being boring, and even the nontraditional songs fit in very well and aren't too ""pop-y"". Amy Grant's voice is perfectly suited to this kind of music and she knows how to sing a wonderful song and just let its natural beauty speak for itself. I shudder to think of this same set of songs mutilated by Christina Aguilera's relentless moans and gratuitous runs.The bottom line: you could put this CD on in July and it would bring visions of snowy lamp-lit streets, sleigh rides, mall Santas, manger scenes, and people being inexplicably kind to one another. And that's the way it should be. I'm talking to you, Ms. Aguilera."
5,My favorite Christmas CD,"I must be getting sentimental since having children, but this is the only Christmas CD I routinely put on. It is so good, I bought a replacement one this year when either I lost it or my 3 year old confiscated it...only time will tell what happened. Amy Grant really can sing the xmas stuff."
2,Just a few sound cues,"I love Thomas Newman's work. This music may have worked in the movie, but not as a soundtrack CD. The cues are short, and once you've listened to three tracks on the CD you've heard them all. If you have his Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael CD and the American Beauty ST you don't really need this one. Only for the most diehard soundtrack collectors."
5,It's Awesome,"This book is truly a book for the intelectually elite. Obviously, the others that gave this work of literary genius a review, know nothing about judging books. I would recommend this masterpiece to any aspiring historian or student who wishes to excel."
3,It's no Kagan,"Hindsight is 20:20, but it need not be pretentious. While a textbook out to explain how new evidence changes validity of past actions, there is a just limit. This textbook exerts an annoying and biased superiority complex as it continually states that whatever historical action was filled with ""illogic"" and innumerable other ways of calling the people of history stupid. These accusations fall along lines of an ultimate failure without fair consideration of the historic alternatives. It is a ""fair-weather"" textbook which, in addition, uses phrases which have long been retired from common English.With all of this said, the textbook is not horrendous. It provides a logical progression and meets general standards of comprehensiveness."
4,decent book,"This book was pretty decent. It surely wasn't spectacular, but it was manageable. I used this book in my ap us history class, and there was a ton of required reading from this text. Fortunatly, I found many portions of the book to be humorous, and the descriptions were very readable. There is good distribution of images and political cartoons throughout the text as well. At one point, in review for the ap test, I managed to reread about 30 chapters in 2 weeks. That's about 600 pages. That should tell you something about the entertainment value of the book. It's not exciting, but it goes along pretty well."
1,HORRIBLE,"This book remains by far one of the worst textbooks I have ever read. The authors' choice of words obscure the writing entirely, and the computer generated tests that go along with this book remain nearly impossible to pass without cheating. Once you hit the middle of the book, not a single person can get an ""A"", let alone only two people are able to pass with a low to (occasionally) mid ""B""; the overwhelming majority score in the 50s. I have never been in a class in which so many hard-working (10 hours of studying a week for me, if not more) and bright kids cannot even get an ""A"" or a ""B"". Do not listen to this review. I am a student and I speak for many, many students who feel the same way; by the way, among those students whom I am referring to are one who has published his own book already, another who nearly scored a perfect score on the SAT, and another who has his own business: these are not ordinary kids. BAD BAD BAD BOOK"
1,AWFUL,This book is my text book for US History AP. I hate it. I can hardly handle reading a chapter out of it. The usage of metaphors and figurative language takes over the presentation of the facts. I get lost in trying to figure out what is meant by the figurative stuff and never get the facts straight. There is no overview or key points. I suggest the book for reading as entertainment but not as education.
2,unbiased? i think not...,"i had this book for my 11 grade ap us history class and i didn't start learning us history until i stoped reading this book and picked up another one. while it does have ""wit"" and metaphors up to here (*motions to the forehead*), it lacks key words in bold or a glossary. granted, i used an older edition and maybe this one has updated its ways, and maybe some scholars hate key words in bold, but it was essential. when scanning the text for important information that you KNOW you read somewhere in the text, you cannot find it. that is infuriating and frustrating beyond compare. you might be trying to prove something and you don't have any bold words as guides. you can't find it and your argument is left unsupported.it has wit (and contrived, forced wit at that). and it has endless metaphors that bog down the reading of history. and it has not much else."
2,Extreme Bias,"I don't think I've ever read a textbook so bias towards history, particularly entering WWI and WWII. Not only is every paragraph injected with strong adjectives, and often extreme opinions(demonizing the whole German state? I think not), but there is false information too. It clearly states that the Berlin Wall first came down in December 1989 and didn't fully fall for another few months when the actual date recognized by people the world over is November 9, 1989. I knew this for a fact, but what about all of the other facts I don't know quite as well? If you have this book, please read it with a filter, and if you haven't bought it yet, think twice about buying opinions."
3,easy to read but too much useless info,"I can honestly say that reading/learning this book thoroughly helped me get a 4 on the AP exam. It was easy to read too.However, it was pretty annoying to sift through A LOT of useless information in the book. There was one chapter where they took up a fourth of a page to describe Andrew Jackson's HAIR COLOR and physical features.In the chapter about the salem witch trials, they actually felt it necessary to tell you that 2 dogs died in the witch hunt.etc."
2,Terrible - long and bombastic,"Throughout AP United States History, my school had the American Pageant, and the students unanimously abandoned it for ""United States History: Preparing for the Advanced Placement Examination.""The problem with the Pageant is that there is too much of it. We pulled out this book every once in a while just to look at the pretty pictures and maps in it, and to make fun of its ""superfluous glory"" - because that's what it is. Superfluous. If you're looking for a book that you can spend many hours reading like a novel, I guess this is it. If you just want the facts, or care about passing an AP exam, this is NOT the right book."
1,Weak on objectivity and more so on credibility,"Could hardly make it past the first two chapters. I have never seen a publication with so many spelling errors and with such slighted views of history. There was nothing original about presentation of the information or any valuable insight provided. I could not believe this was an AP history text ... Yikes, what are we teaching our kids. no wonder they are tuning out."
3,Slightly dissapointing.,"Although this textbook serves as a good introduction to US History, it is difficult to gather much actual information from the text. In an attempt to increase readability, the authors rarely mention dates or locations of important events, leading to confusion. A timeline at the end of each chapter helps to alleviate this problem, but it is nevertheless annoying. On the plus side, many small jokes are inserted throughout the chapters and help the reader to stay awake while reading about the especially boring parts of our country's history"
2,Sadly inadequate,"I'm using this book right now for my APUSH class. I usually enjoy reading about history, but this book makes it terrible. The constant ""witticisms"" seem to trivialize what the book describes, and even worse, it seems to be not nearly in-depth enough to provide any decent insight into what happened, as if it were not even skimming the surface, merely looking upon it. (The writing style has rubbed off on me.) It leaves me very unsatisfied, and my understanding of the concepts is left with huge holes that my teacher constantly has to clarify in class. If you really care about learning the material well, find another textbook that actually gives the details with thoughtful analysis rather than an overgeneralized, almost fictionalized ""account"" of the basic events."
1,Liberal BS,"I'm told earlier editions of American Pageant were pretty good, but the 12th edition is practically worthless. The preface brags about compressing the real history in this edition and expanding coverage of ""immigrants, slaves, the environment and women"". The text takes every oppurtunity to deride Europeans for cruelty, but when mentioning other races, no such words are attributed to them. For example, the Aztecs' human sacrifice, etc. is presented matter-of-factly. When the discovery of America is described, parentheses are placed around the word ""discovery"". It waxes about the authors's morals and ethics more than it does a presentation of history. In fact, several times when a massacre against Europeans is described, or the spread of native diseases to Europeans, the phrase ""poetic justice"" is used. I don't recommend this book unless you're interested in reading a demonization of American history and culture."
3,"Bailey's American Pageant is educational, but tedious","I used this book for my sophomore history class and I will continue using the last half of the book next year in US History AP. Although I learned a lot from this book, I think that it is extremely boring. You can only read a certain number of pages at a time before your mind begins to wander. I recommend that after every ten pages (normally half way through a chapter) you go for a ten minute walk to clear your head... otherwise, the remaining pages drag by VERY slowly. In addition, this book lacks a review of chapters, and fails to point out important facts in history- making it extremely difficult to review for a final exam. However, on the other hand,the book is well-written (though sometimes a little corny or too metaphorical) and gives the reader a lot of information about American history."
3,Terrible but worthy...if you have the Teacher,"I feel the Pageant doesn't live up to all the hype about it. Its put together poorly, and written in an odd way. reminds me more of a 6th grade history book with some satire, then an AP worthy text. The writters go out of their way too be funny. The book is kind of short... which is good in someways, but has 42 Chapters. it would be easier if they combined Chapters and one would read all about one thing in one chapter. a 30 chapter book would be excellent. Its easy reading, which allows for one to get through a chapter quickly, but sense its so easy to read, its easy to look over some things. Its not a terrible book, but doesn't live up to other books out there. Youll either like this book or hate it, depends on the person and what they like in a text book..."
1,Worst History Book Ever!!!,I have loved history ever since I was born. I hated my AP US History Class because of this book. It is very leftsided. I would recommend not using this book!
5,Canon Comes Though Again!,"I had three of the SONY Dye sublimation printers, and was very happy with them until about 6 months ago. I upgraded my cameras to the 8 megapixel range. Guess what, the JPEG's produced by these cameras exceeds the capcity of the Sony printers. OK, I could still use them on my lower grade cameras. Nope, Sony cancelled the printers and their supplies. Time to upgrade. Sony was not a consideration after being burned. No tech support, and hidden limitations. Looked to Canon and saw thay had a great replacement. Bought it on Amazon for $120 shipped. Pictures are better then the Sony and the per-print charge is less then half of Sony's. The Sony's just hit the trash and I'm getting a second CP-710."
2,Price is good but some bits came without sharp,"Some of bits came without sharp and oxidized, I try these and just burn the wood, I tried another one that came in good condition and worked fine. For this price I didn't hope more than I received."
2,Doesn't fit all saddles,"I bought this at the LBS, which is great because I can take it back. I wanted it for my wife's bike, but the Bontragger seat that came with bike does not have the more vertical rails that this bag would fit on. They are just straight out. The bag clip has about a 30 degree or more angle, so won't fit at all. So, I tried it on my mountain bike, the rails on that saddle are too close. I tried it on my Brooks saddle, their too far apart, I tried it on the Scott saddle, again, it won't fit. So, what saddle will it fit? I suggest taking your saddle in to the shop to see what will fit before you buy one. I'm going back to the strap and hook, simple system, no worries about if it will fit. Other than that, I do like the bag style. Looks like it would have been very useful system. Too bad it won't work."
3,Good Bag But May Not Fit All Saddles,The attachment did not fit my saddle as the supports were too close. I had to jury rig something to make it fit. Strange as my saddle is made by Bowtrange which is a well known make.
1,Not so good,"Has a fanless power supply, which means it comes with a large external AC to DC power converter (like you have with a laptop, only bigger). Unfortunately the connector they use to connect the external power converter to the case does not engage firmly and is very loose. Not sure if this would be a problem as the power supply is dead and wouldn't power up the motherboard.Will send it back and try a different brand."
5,"Very clear, lots of samples","I was using some database products in an ""informal"" waysince 10 years ago. This book helped me to clarify severalconcepts needed for a good foundation in database design.The examples are very well designed, most involving ""classical""situations, but presented with several degrees of dificulty.The style is a bit dense at first, but easily readable.This recommentation is obvious, but not always followed: readthis kind of material before trying to learn from the database""concepts"" included in the specific product's guide."
4,CTO Full,"The product was exactly as described. A little dark for my liking, but maybe as an outdoor flash filter it'll do me justice. What i would have preferred though is a sheet a lot smaller and most cost effective. It's not over-priced, by market standards, it's just that I only use it for flash filters as most photographers I know. One small sheet of even 4x6 would have covered a couple flash units, and saved a few dollars and maybe a faster delivery time. Otherwise, no product quality complaints."
2,OK but strains a bit,"I read this story aloud to a group of early elementary kids and it held their attention, I guess. The pictures are nicely evocative and the story is fine. But why does it end with that straining bit about how much the kids adore the story? And what in the world does ""abba-no-potato-man"" mean anyway? They really wanted to know and I couldn't figure it out. Is it something about ""apples-(something)-potato""? Or some nonsense phrase? They were straining to figure it out and I felt like an idiot for not knowing."
3,A bit myopic and not very thorough,"The authors began their book by contrasting ""positivism"" with ""naturalist-interpretive paradigms"", essentially painting an unflattering portrait of quantitatively focused research in an effort to make their interpretive-constructionist approach more appealing to researchers with a social agenda. They also relativized truth to the point that their approach makes benchmarking the data almost impossible. Furthermore they appeared to be hypersensitive to the need to appear credible to critics; it read like a bizarre prep course in politics rather than an overview of best practices in qualitative data collection. I was looking for some solid, grounded methods in qualitative interviewing and felt like I got a bouquet of anecdotes instead. For more balanced coverage of qualitative research methods check outQualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Approaches"
4,Rare Songs on this collections,"I bought this for a couple songs in particular. Legs, True Love and Reggae Man. I could not find these tracks anywhere else and the album they were released on doesn't seem to be available on CD. I enjoyed listening to them once again!Downside: Sun is Here, Radiation Level and Sun is Here, cuts are not original versions. They sound remastered but also a slightly different from the original. It didn't bother me that much since I have the original via Sun Greatest Hits.Downside part2: The sound quality on this CD isn't best.Would I buy it again? Absolutely."
5,Mystical healing meditative sound,"This wonderful CD was created by Dr. Jeffrey Thompson as a sound reconstruction of the sacred geometry/mathematics of the auspicious Sri Yantra. People have deep experiences listening to it. It is not for your car, since it does settle you down quite a bit. Sit with an erect spine, with eyes closed. You may also wish to listen to it while gazing at a picture of the Sri Yantra. if you have trouble sleeping, try playing it softly while you are lying down in bed; I tend to fall asleep quickly when I do this. If you are interested in exploring consciousness, you will love this CD. It creates a centered, harmonious, meditative experience. This is not Sanskrit chanting."
3,This CD Is OK,"Not the best CD I've ever got, but not the worst. Since it is live there is a lot of talking in between songs, this is the gayest thing about this CD But it's pretty good, the best rapper on this CD is definately DMX."
4,classics songs not often heard,I saw the movie and thought that the music really made the movie come alive. Great songs that touch the heart. Spellbinding movie and great songs that pass over the waves.
3,My two cents,"This is not a terrible album, but I do find it wanting. My greatest complaint is with the quality of the recordings and the CD's themselves (scratched too easily). My copy also has some misprints on the cover (the pieces are not listed in the correct order- if you didn't know any better you might think that you were listening to an arrangement of the Pourtuguese national anthem instead of ""A Night in the Tropics""!). However, it is inexpensive (it is a 2 CD set) and worth it to those who are giving Gottschalk a first try. It also has an interesting and informative booklet on Gottschalk and the pieces featured (unfortunately I am not enough of an expert to verify their acuracy)."
4,nice set of light classics,"I can easily imagine all this music filling the programs of bandstand orchestras throughout America in the mid 19th century. Nothing really deep, dark or slow and long winded. This is the type of music that made Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops so very popular in the 60's. Don't expect anything too serious. I imagine that American composers of the 19th century knew that composers from Vienna, Paris, Berlin and eastern Europe had a monopoly on ""serious"" music at that time. So Gottschalk hasn't written anything here that puts him in the same league as the three composers that he seems most inspired by, Mendelssohn,Berlioz or Verdi. He should be at least as famous as Johann Strauss or Franz Lehar, two other composers who also strove only to entertain."
2,There are better performances,This album will disappoint Gottschalk fans. A better version of Night in the Tropics is the Maurice Abravanel & Utah Symphony. Only buy this one if you've already heard the Abravanel and want to know what it sounds like mangled by Europeans.
5,Great for plaster dust,"We tore out the kitchen, walls and all, and I bought one of these at the local hardware store where I bought the new, bigger/better shopvac after the small one we had couldn't keep up. When that bag was almost full of plaster dust, I order more, they came quickly as always with Amazon Prime, and they kept us working. As promised, they don't leak all that dust and are worth the upgrade from regular bags. (Note: had to buy a new filter, too.)"
1,Shop Vac type H does not fit 5 gallon wall-hung Shop Vac,"Amazon's posting for the 5 gallon Wall-hung Shop Vac suggests the S-V 9067100 for purchase with the wall-hung. However, upon receipt of the bags there was no way that they would fit. A call to Shop-Vac got me the corect dust bags for the wall-hung. They are Shop-Vac 9193200 5-Gallon Hang Up Collection Bag. Don't order what Amazon suggests!"
1,A Bit More Glue Please!,"Along with my new Shop Vac I ordered two packages of disposable bags. Unfortunately [for me] the bags are defective. Too little glue was used on the seams causing them to rupture within two or three uses. With no bag to catch the debris, the vac filter gums up and loses suction. My 30 day return privileges expired before I discovered the defect in all of the bags I purchased. Amazon has no mechanism in place that I could find to alert them of the problem. Great Shop Vac! Worthless bags. Skip Amazon and buy them locally."
5,Worth the money and then some,We had a lot of drywall dust during our basement remodel. This bag caught all of it! No dust flew out. It's a must have for drywall projects.
5,Excellet vacuum bags,"I am just so pleased with my Shop Vac system and these bags add to the efficiency. I am cleaning out old insulation, dust, and unmentionable gross stuff from a 50 year old attic. The Shop Vac has these bags installed, and the air stays much cleaner (though I also wear a respirator, for additional safety). When I roll up a dusty piece of insulation, I keep the Shop Vac running with the hose right next to it and it has cut down immensely on the amount of airborn crud. Great system, highly recommended for renovation tasks!"
5,Shop Vac Wahoo,"What a terrific idea. This is the handiest item I've added to the garage in years. Out of the way and tons quieter than my old roll around unit. I've wired mine permanently into a switched outlet on the wall and with the 18 foot hose, I can reach every corner of the garage and interiors of both cars."
5,Perfect bag for cleaning up ashes,"been using these bags for my pellet stove ashes for years now, don't know why but never considered buying these on Amazon, well, looked them up, and for the same price as in the store I don't have to go out using my gas to get them, and have them posibly out of stock.The obvious is make sure stove is cooled down, and no hot ash remains, or you will have a fire.The pros is if you wait for stove to be cool, these bags combined with your shop vac, and no ash in the air, and an easy cleanup. Worth the extra price!"
5,A must read for parents with special need child,"It is a concise, to-the-point, and practical presentation of information that I found extremely useful in the dealing with local school district, which I found overwhelming. A good companion book of 'Wirghts Law' book, which covers the basics. Strongly recommend to read before heading for IEP meetings, since it tells you what to ask, and how to fight back specifically. It contains a good number of sample letters which may come in handy."
1,Yu-Gi-Oh just doesn't cut it,"This isn't specifically this DVD, but the Yu-Gi-Oh series in general. It's not as much a ""great anime"" as something more like Pokemon, something younger children can identify with easier, not that there aren't older fans. Still, the entire concept of this series is old: ""Believe in yourself"". The whole series is based off this, and in every episode there's usually some ""random chance"" in which the character has a flashback of all his friends, and then miraculously draws the winning card. Sure, more and more ""powerful"" cards appear, but nothing really changes. Find a better anime."
1,bad movie,This movie is a waste of your money. You will have nightmares because the animation is horrible.
5,One of the Best Duels I've Ever Seen,"This DVD is so cool. It is the third Yugi Vs. Kaiba duel and the premiere of the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon. Pegasus tells Kaiba that he needs to defeat Yugi in a duel to rescue Mokuba's soul (which he is unhappy about). When Yugi and co. get to the castle, Kaiba is blocking the way. So they duel with the duel disks and Kaiba summons the Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon (after about 10 turns). Later Yugi gets an army of Three Toed Hairballs (aka.Kuriboh). I won't tell you who wins so buy the DVD or watch the episode on Kids WB to find out (even if you already know buy it anyway)."
3,Mai fan review,Ok since when did pokemon go out of style anyways this is all about KaibaVs. Yugi Kaiba lays it really thick on yugi uses his virus card so yugi can only use monsters under 1500 it gets real close until stupid kaiba goes on the edge of the tower threatning that if yugi attacked his weakened blue eyes the hit might be too much and he might fall off yami yugi almost had attacked the blue eyes but then yugi struggled for his celtic guardian to stop and he got scared because he was afraid that the pharoh would do anything to win even to hurt someone thats why he vowed to never duel again even though eventually he does after the shining friendship episode when tai gave him the strength he needed
3,"Great idea, but....","The idea is fantastic. Unfortunately, on day one of use, the left wheel came off. It's almost as if the hole drilled for the screw is too large because the same thing keeps happening even with replacement screws. While it was functional, it was perfect for my needs though!"
4,PLeased,"It is what we needed for our business, so we are pleased to have it. But it is heavy and not that easy for me to open and close. The cart feature is good and I do feel stury when on it, but its tough to manuever."
1,Could have made it better,"You'll have to use loctite on all the bolts. They all came loose and fell off. The fold down platform doesn't lock. And because the platform doesn't site flat to ground, you'll get hit in the head every time you place anything on the platform. I weigh 200 pounds, and the support bars on the steps bent. Modifications had to be made to correct all the problems."
5,ladder,"This ladder is wonderful. It is the right size for my use. I take it with me on photography jobs and it is easy to setup, collapse & roll.The main reason I purchased this was because it had wheels & I could roll it. Such a simple idea...... wonderful."
4,Ladder / hand cart # TSM-31LHT,I am a professional event photographer. This ladder is very helpful to be able to wheel all of my gear in and out in a single trip. A little unstable when loading cart. Sturdy to stand on ladder. Would recommend.
4,I Love It!,"As a photographer, I love this for hauling my equipment. The padded handle is very comfortable even for the biggest hands. Then, I have the bonus of having a step ladder to get a better angle when I need it. The wheels are strong and don't wobble at all. I wish they were bigger though. All said, I'd give it 4 and a half stars."
4,Great combo unit,This hand cart/step ladder does everything it says it will do with only one drawback...the wheels are little to small for doorjams and uneven surfaces.
4,Nice but..,"Its something all photographers should have, but I think if it had softer wheels like those on a roller blade, it would be nicer. Makes too much noise from the hard wheels"
4,Just what I needed,This product does what it says it will do - had some difficulty putting it together but it does what I need it to do so it is good!
3,A Fun Collection of Stuff,"Overall, this is an enjoyable CD - a good mix of 60's music as heard from the 90's. The songs ABOUT Austin Powers rather interrupt the proceedings, and I didn't really need to hear ""I Touch Myself"" again. Otherwise, fun for listening or grooving."
3,CD only has a few good songs on it,"I bought this CD because I wanted "" Soul Bossa Nova,"" and figured that the other songs would be good.Wrong.There are about 3 songs that I listen to on this CD.The fembot song "" These Boots were made for walking"" is not on the CD, as well as some other songs that I thought would be on there.If you're an Austin fan, then the songs would be worth it, but if not, then save your money."
4,I found it nostalgic.,"This CD might hold more appeal for baby boomers than generation X'ers, but if you enjoyed the music while watching the movie, then you'll likely enjoy this CD. The subtly modernized version of The Turtles classic ""You Showed Me"" put a new twist on an old favorite. I was impressed that some of the remakes even contained simulated vinyl pops and scratches making this CD literally groovy!. Many of the late 60's classics brought back some nice feelings. The CD would not have been complete without ""Mas Que Nada"", however, I was disappointed that ""Secret Agent Man"" was absent. Also, it would have been nice to have included the original version of Bacharach's ""What The World Needs Now is Love"". All in all though this was a very ""groovy"" CD!"
5,People who don't like this are nuts!,"I like every song but 1 on this CD. They're the same ones that're on the movie and if you don't like the movie, you probably wouldn't like the CD."
3,Ok...,"This CD was ok, but not great. I totally agree with everyone that thinks that the song in the beginning of the movie should have been on the soundtrack. There were really only a couple of good songs. I LOVED the movie, but the soundtrack wasn't anything great."
4,Question about missing song,Does anyone know the music they played in the background when Austin and Vanessa went into the casino where #2 and Alotta Fagina were?
3,A Good Compilation Of New And Old,"Here is a soundtrack of tunes from the first movie that started the ""Yeah, baby"" craze. It has a few classics (""Incense and Peppermints"", ""Soul Bossa Nova"", and ""Mas Que Nada"") with some new songs and new recordings of 60's classics."
5,amazing jazz from south america,"I've listened to this CD and I'm amazed at the quality of this production. A Jazz singer who can really sing, wonderful arrangements, superb musicianship and best of all, the songs chosen for this production are beautiful. Anyone who's interested in what's going on outside the US should get this CD."
5,"Ayúdame a ser tuyo, Tiriti, Amor multiplicado por dos.","Es un cantante excelente, a mí en lo personal, me encanta, me parece que es un chavo sencillo, sabe lo que quiere, inteligente, apasionado, en fín, que podría yo decir, de él, es mejor se humano del mundo."
5,Sergio is fantastic!,"I love so many songs on this album! I've been listening to this CD since I got it, and I doubt I'll ever get sick of it. ""Mienteme,"" ""Completamente Tocado,"" ""Ella Provoca,"" ""Por un cafe, por un helado,"" and ""El Tiriti"" are my favorites! I would love to see him in concert!"
2,And then THUD!,"This ""game"" is so disappointing. My nephew loves Spiderman. He needs fun and subtle cues to stay engaged. He was so excited to get this his first LMAX cartridge we could barely get the box open fast enough. We popped it in and had to wait until the commercials or very long intro completed. Then we had to blindly navigate through the screens to get to games. They were NOT intuitive and then THUD. He lost interest and has not returned to the LMax since. What an absolute waste of money."
1,A Big Disappointment,"My son and I had great expectations for this game; our expectations quickly turned in to disappointment. This ""game"" is really hard to call a game. It's more like one long reading exercise. Unlike many of the other L-Max games, wherein you learn the modules through interactive play, with this one you have to read and read and read the same story over again. Once you complete the story, you can then go to another area to ""unlock"" the game. Then in order to play the ""game"" you have to read some more. This is not the type of game where you can standby and provide guidance when needed, I found myself reading page, after page, after page, just to figure out for myself the objective of the ""game"" and then try to explain it to my son. I felt the money I paid for this game was a waste, no wonder when I went to purchase it, it was the only one in stock. Buyers beware!"
5,Kurama and Yusuke all alone?,Well in this volume Yusuke and Kurama fright alone. I bet you are asking why Yusuke and Kurama have to fright alone. Well let me tell you Hiei and the Mask Frigther are traped in this some what of barer of somr sort and Kuwabara is relly hurt from the last battle. He is unable to fright even walk. Yes its going to be a hard battle. and you now it too. Theres only two frighters that can fright and that is Yusuke and Kurama. To tell you the truth I was so scared when Kurama go hurt. Yusuke was vary mad.
3,Something wrong with the song order,"I'm not sure, but it seemed to be that the songs on this video were playing out of sequence. Something definitely seemed off about the transitions between songs. However, myself and my family love Signing Time and will probably buy this item as a DVD. I give it three stars based on the strength of the series."
2,Poor Value,Very poor sound quality ruins the whole DVD. There is some good info but I could hardly stand to listen to it. This should cost only $5 or $10 at the most.
3,On Target,"Very interesting content. In my opinion, one of the better documentary on the basic makings of a Sniper. The video quality is similar to VHS tape (that has been played more than enough). It would have received 4 stars if the video quality was DVD or HD equivalent. I hope the Major would release a better quality version as I would not mind spending on the same title that has a better video quality format. It would have received 5 stars if the on-the-field diagrams are computer generated in sequence as to illustrate the effectiveness in range/target gauging, etc."
2,Book is better,"If you've read the book, which has some descent information and building blocks for this topic, pass on this video. I'll give the Major the benefit of the doubt here and guess it's his first acting attempt. Some of the camo is geared toward hunting since anyone watching the intro would shoot his hookie camo wrap thing. His attempt to show you the real techniques which he described in the book is lost in this video. Half way through I was fighting to pay attention and feeling rather sleepy. That being said I do recommend the Advance Ultimate Sniper dvd. Read my review on that title."
1,the dvd sucks,please if you have not expirience at all with snipers this dvd wont help you the guy just talks about many things that are not real important if you dont know how to measure your target and how to graduate your scopeyou will loose your money because he do not teach thatbesides really bad sound and image
3,"Good, but not his Best!","It was certainly different, but all the hype by Universal did not justify the actual product. Just when I was about to give up on ever buying another Feliciano album (like there are not enough out there), I came across the DVD/CD Jose Feliciano, Ayer, Hoy y Siempre. I am once again a Feliciano fan. The CD is great, many of the songs I have never heard before, and they really give you your monies worth with the DVD, they threw everything in there except the kitchen sink! Live concert, with great DVD authoring, plus Celia Cruz, and a Santana Duet on the CD as an added bonus. Buy it!"
2,Sr. Bolero,"Too slick, too smooth, none of the passion of ""Light My Fire."" The background violins get in the way. As luck would have it, I have a recording of ""Como Fue"" by the great Beny More. Jose sounds like an amateur by comparison. In fact, Jose does not sound as good as Ibrahim Ferrer, who came out with his own version of ""Como Fue"" a couple of years ago. Jose's voice and guitar playing sound as good as ever. The album notes provide the lyrics and translations. A good album for watching the moon with someone you love. 51 minutes total playing time."
5,THE BEST GAME!,I thought this was the best digimon game ever! The graphics are amazing...The pictures may not look like it but when you playing the game in your hands! Its totally DIFFERENT!...I can't wait till Digimon World 4 comes out for gamecube...!!1
3,OKAY,THIS GAME IS OKAY NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST BUT DONT GET ME WRONG ITS STILL GOOD. THE only thing different than the first is new digimon and a bonus game. the downside is that this game has a lot less characters than the first
4,This game is cool !!!!!,This game is going to be the digimon game ever!!!! On Sept.26Bandi is releasing a really tight game. I can't wait till I get my copy.
1,Look else where,"I bought this product for my daughters new MP3/AVI player so that she could recharge the USB lithium battery in the car during travels and any AC outlet in the U.S.. Well, true to form, on the first attempt it trashed her Christmas present, losing all her music, videos and pictures and leaving her bored most our travels. I would not recommend anyone buy this product ... look else where."
1,Remove one star from my review,"If only I could give this movie 0 Stars! I endured this movie for too long and found none of the characters interesting. Why do so many people like this film???If you are thinking of buying this film, if it has been recommended to you, then read all the 1 star reviews first. Then make the right decision and avoid this waste of time."
5,Vince Vaughn! Money Baby,Anyone who has not caught on to how great Vince Vaughn is should see this. It is like watching your ID on stage while being safe in your own conservative facade.
5,"Great breakup movie, hysterically funny in parts","A friend who is going through a miserable divorce played this movie for me - who is also going through a miserable divorce. I laughed so hard I had to get my own copy of the movie. Who woulda thought Vince Vaughn was once so handsome??? I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. The ending of the movie is a little hard to swallow but parts of the movie had me in stitches - this movie is damn near brilliant. So I saw the followup movie (forgot the title) starring these same two guys. Both performances in both movies brought to mind Alan Arkin and James Caan in ""Freebie & The Bean"". I wonder if thats what they were going for."
4,Good philosophical theme,"I've heard a lot of the dialogue in this movie from law school students in my class, and I never understood the origin until now. Quotes such as ""Vegas, baby, Vegas."" I had no idea where such comments arose. Apparently this is an often quoted movie, although you won't find me quoting it. Yes, the movie is of high quality, that is, if you are able to look deep enough into why it was made, and discover the various themes imbedded throughout the story.The main theme is that people have expectations regarding certain events or people in their life. Typically, the expectation is larger than life and can consume much of our thinking. This happens quite often when the theme involves love: who is rational when in love? Very few. The mind becomes enamored with positive thoughts of the person, and these thoughts will sometimes interfere with other plans that one should be embarking upon. This movie truly centers on that theme, and is one reason why I rate it a 4."
5,Awesome movie,"One of the best movies ever. Had it in VHS, and have been streaming it, and still felt like I had to buy the BR version. Classic."
4,your so money and you don't even know it,"This movie is a must-see. I've seen it I don't know how many times, because its all about a guy being depressed over his ex-girlfriend and trying to get back into the dating game but can't quite do it, somewhere most guys have been at some point. It's got a classy soundtrack, and tons of cool little one-liners. The best thing about it is that the dialogue is probably exactly like the dialogue most people in or just out of college have. Watch it."
4,Money,"This movie is so money you dont even know it...Great movie, it really shows how gifted Vince Vaughn is as a comedic actor, and even at a young age..""We'll be up five hunny by midnight..""CT"
5,Worthy of 10 stars!!!,"This film is without a doubt the greatest movie for guys of its generation.As has been said in other reviews what makes this film so enjoyable to watch besides the clever writing and wonderful performances by the cast is the fact that you can relate to it. Every guy knows, or has known, a Trent, Mikey or Sue which is what makes it so easy to identify with the characters and immerse yourself into the story. As cheesy as it sounds, I always feel like I just spent an hour and a half with some of my closest friends after watching it.The commentary by Favreau and Vaughn was hilarious, got a chance to pick up on little details I hadn't noticed before as well as other interesting tidbits about the movie. I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the features."
5,SO MONEY!!,"Quite simply - my second favorite movie of all-time. This movie is brilliantly written and has made me a Vince Vaughn fan for life.Guys will relate to every seen - from trying to pick-up women in bars to classic sceens of the guys playing EA Sports hockey. For example:Trent: There's nothing wrong with letting a woman know that you're money and that you're looking to party.Sue (a guy):I won the Stanley Cup with the Los Angeles Kings. Trent: Yeah but that was against the computer with the offsides turned off!""The first time I saw this movie I almost took it out of the VCR half-way through. It's brilliance all comes together at the end and watching it over and over will make you appreciate it's greatness and may actually change the way you speak."
4,they're so young!,"Vince and Jon are so young in this movie, it's weird to see after watching their recent movies. But it is a classic, and its a great movie, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I remembered. It was good, but it didn't have much too it. It was just a story, a relatable, fun story, but nothing really happened. But its a good movie about girls, love, gambling, and most of all going out and having fun!"
3,Swingers,"Perhaps a little bit over the top in trying to be overly-cool and ""indie""(I hate Indie Films as much as hollywood films),yet you can't help but wonder wow,I know someone like that or a situation like that.It has no point or plot and somehow not too funny yet in a bizarre way still worth watching,you will love,hate or like it,Or be indifferent towards it,I am in the middle."
5,Your so money and you don't even know it!!,"This is a must see for every single guy in the US. It has all your friends and you in it. The too cool player (who is out of control) the excentric, the layed back guys, the hurt guy in a slump and it even has late night, drunk, crap talking, video game hockey. I cant decide if it is that funny or depressing that we are this easy to figure out. I am about 45 minutes away from tying a friend down a forcing him to watch this. He is Vince Vaugh. Your going down Tidy! You too BAC! dc"
4,I think people missed the point of this one,"I went to see Big Bad Vodoo Daddy at Chicago's House of Blues a while after this movie came out and was amazed by the number of guys who thought they were Vince Vaugn. The point of this movie is that these guys are lame, social misfits who livetheir whole lives like a movie because they are afraid to have real relationships! That said, it's a damn funny movie!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Except for introducing the Vince Vaughn stock character who we're all getting sick of, Swingers is notable for very little; a forgettable film with no real plot thrust and little interesting character interaction, Swingers is really not worth watching, much less purchasing."
5,Great movie! Makes me wish I was still single.,This movie is funny and easy to relate to. I don't think there is anyone out there that can say they haven't felt the same way at some point in time.
5,This movie is the money!!!,I have seen this movie over a dozen times and laugh harder each time I watch it. I recommend it for all single women out there-some of us are just like Trent! It's so true to life of how nightlife is!!A must see
2,BAD BAD BAD picture quality on this DVD,I recently bought it because I found it to be one of the best films I have come across in years only to find that the DVD version of the movie was horrible. I have over 60 DVDs in my collection and I have to say this is the worst one I have EVER bought. The picture quality is just unbelievably bad... and to think that this movie was so good. What a wasted opportunity. Please pass this info on to other prospective buyers of this DVD. I think they have a right to know how bad the picture quality is before they lay down a 20 dollar bill and some change for it.
4,Indi film for the broken hearted...,I recommend this film to all my friends who just got left in the dust of a long relationship. Good story line. Good Writing. Well directed. Some of the most naturalistic acting I've seen in a long time. Makes me want to move to LA and get a life.Watch it...
1,WTF?,"Sorry, I just don't understand. Why the hell does Amazon list Swingers on dvd on October 2, 2001? It was available 2 years ago from Amazon! That's where I got it! Unfortunately I lent it to a friend. blah bastard blahSo I come back to the site to re-order it and find that it won't be released for 2-3 months?! What? Did I fall into some twisted ass star trek logic time trap? 2 years ago it was available on Amazon and NOW IT IS NOT YET RELEASED?? I mean it's not like I was looking for a new special version or anything.. I just wanted the Swingers that I had before.Fortunately, I moved sideways and checked out Barnes & Noble (bn.com). Being a loyal amazon fan I didn't want to do it but I had no choice. And what did I find there?? They will be shipping it to me in 2 days (airmail).Amazon corp, I have been a huge fan for a long time but you need to stop pulling this $*@$."
1,filth,"The hate I feel when confronted by films such as this scares me.A hollow movie if there ever was one, that in intention serves to make us laugh but failed by making me sick. There is hardly a character to like in this to-hip-for-its-own-good piece of filth, but you can't fault them for trying. The hero is a sad little boy who misses his girlfriend and cries over how lonely he is in his nice clothes with his pretty friends and fast cars. Poor guy. He is his own worst enemy, as is the film. The ""homages"" to other films sreve as the best examples of how the movie confuses the joke to the point where it becomes the joke. This movie is lousy. Period."
1,Movie without a Meaning,"I had to watch this movie because my friends rented and made me watch it. I have no idea why anyone likes this movie, the movie has no plot what so ever! Everyone talks about how funny this movie is yet I watched the movie twice trying to find out what I missed the first time and I still can't find anything funny about this movie. Well thats my 2 cents if you don't like my review I'm sorry to hear that but everyone has their opinon."
1,"Meaningless, and annoying","Hmm...I don't get what was so great about this movie. I saw this once because my friend was begging me to see it. So, I went and rented it. You can go rent any ""guy"" movie and get more substance than this movie. I got really sick of hearing ""You're so money"" (okay, funny the first time, that's it). It's basically good cop-bad cop at a nightclub, Vince Vaughn being the ""bad cop"" trying to get his buddy over a bad relationship by giving him the ""rules"" of women and the night scene. There is nothing refreshing or unique about this movie; this premise has been covered before. Just a stereotypical depiction of single guys. I know that some who rated this movie think that all guys act this way, but I think that is kind of a misrepresentation. If you want to go see a better movie, go rent Animal House."
3,I'm torn...,"This is one of those movies that I would have given a better rating if it didn't have so many painful scenes. On the upnote, the movie had some of the funniest scenes and was very true to life (on that concept it was good). I am from the generation this movie was made for, and after all the hype I am VERY dissappointed."
1,Cheesy,"This movie was so boring. I can't believe that it is considered so ""cool"" by almost everyone under 30. It had no plot, and the lines were so cheesy. I really don't need to watch a movie about some wannabe-actor living in LA who can't get dates. What's the point? I just don't understand the fascination with this movie."
4,Classic movie,"It's hard to imagine Swingers has been out for so long, but it perfectly captures a time segment of American life when that style of dress, music, and life was popular.The movie is full of laughs and any love sick guy who gets dumped by a girl he thought was the one can relate."
5,"Terrific ""old school"" feel good movie!","Great movie, with lots of one-liners, and a must-see for the serious Vince Vaughn fan. Jon Favreau is perfect as his buddy, Mike, whose lines in the movie cannot be forgotten. Captures the ideal late '90's swing era to a T.Michelle S."
4,The Ultimate advice about meeting women movie,"They could package this movie as a self-help movie to lonely guys on how to meet women. It is the best movie that I have ever seen in showing what to do and what not to do, when looking to score with women. Vaughn is the perfect Don Juan and Favreau is the perfect chump in this one. What man dosent wince when watching the scene where Favreau talks to the girls answering machine? Yeah, we've all been there. Study this movie and have more success with the opposite sex. Guaranteed."
5,"I'm a woman, and I LOVE this movie!!!!",This movie is soooo funny!!!! Why would someone think it's degeading to women? It's great. The flow of the movie is awesome. The whole point of the movie is great. It's realistic and interesting from beginning to end. I've watched it probably over 100 times.
4,smart and chic,"Dialogue-driven but stylized ode to blithe bachelor lifestyle in city of dreams. Tarantino sans the violence, ""Swingers"" swings itself to the top of my cult classics list."
5,The whole Judy Garland thing....,"I'm sorry it took me almost 3 years to see this movie, because it is great. Vaughn and Favreau make a great duo because of their contrasting personalities, and the dialog is so... money."
4,Right on the Money,"This movie is a great way to kill a couple of hours. It doesn't attempt to be anything more than it is, a guy's movie about being hip and staying in cool in the face of a broken relationship. I recommend this movie simply because I found it entertaining and kept my interest through out. I know what a simple minded review this is, but in the end, isn't that all you really want out of movie, entertainment?"
2,Loved It only worked Once,"I bought one to help clean up around my pond. The first time out it worked like a charm, however the 2nd time out the thing kept turning itself off. Since my husband ""worked"" on the switch I was unwilling to return it or get it repaired. I was all ready to order a relacement, however upon reading one review I am hesitant to have another go at it. The thing is the one I bought is sitting in the barn looking brand new but it won't even turn on."
3,naughty tricks,The book was ok. not as much information as I had hoped for. Not a lot of new ideas or tips in this book.
4,This book is a great learning tool.,"It teaches you to feel comfortable with your partner and allows you to write your feelings down. I haven't finished the book yet but so far it's worth the buck. I also recommendSex and the Perfect Lover: Tao, Tantra, and the Kama Sutra"
2,Don't Judge By The Cover,I was very disappointed in this a lot we already new. You can get more out of a Cosmopolitan Magazine. Save your money for that.
3,Great Performance \ Recording Flawed,"Abbey Simon is an incredible pianist. There are a few things about this recording that I don't like. One, I think that someone like Abbey Simon could have gotten someone better than the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra to play with him, not saying that they are bad, but I would have prefered the Isralie Symphony or the Berlin Philharmonic. The thing that I really don't like about this recording the the way that tere are harsh and fuzzy orchestra overtones, like a problem with the medium for recording. That said I am very happy with the CD set, it was inexpensive, plus you can't find that many recordings of Rachmaninoff's piano concertos because virtually no one can play them because they are so difficult. I would recommend that buyers look into singular recording of each concerto individually as I find these to be better."
4,sweet carolines's keeper,"this is a good book I'm glad to see that we got a whole book to tell wolfe's story. His chacrater was very... and strong.I find it hard not to like a Linda Howard book. This book moves along fairly well theres some slow spots, but overall a good book.I cant wait for Jack Parker story."
5,Love this arrangement,"My order arrived promptly and was packed extremely well. This is a beautiful, life-like arrangement, appropriate for any time of year. It has brightened my house all Winter and at much less expense than a succession of live flowers. I will send this item to others for Valentine's Day and other special occasions."
5,Its Great!!!,"When i bought this game, i didnt think it would be challenging because i'm really good at video games, but its real difficult. I died 15 times already and i still didnt beat the first level. this game is great! you wont beat the first level till you have died at least 15 times.other than the great graphics and great gameplay, the opening movie makes the game look even better. even the digimons fur has great detail.trust me, you'll like the game, a lot!"
3,Opps! Not what I was looking for,"This product only has Katakana in it! There is a product that looks the same, but has Kanji instead. BE CAREFUL! It comes with an extra practice pad, which is nice."
2,Not funny.,"I read the reviews and this seemed like a gem, but after watching numerous episodes it turned out to be fake gold. Bummed."
3,So-so,"I love Matt Berry from Dark Place, IT Crowd, and Boosh so I decided to check this out. It's not all funny, but it does have some good moments."
1,Missing Tracks,I was specifically looking for the track during the seige at the loft when the little boy had the head-phones on. Its not on this recording.
3,good but stuff is missing,I agree with doron. Its good but there is stuff missing. The stuff doron named and the music from the explosive shootout in Caster Troy's gang's apartment (when the whole swat team desides to drop in). But it was still worth the buy.
2,JUST NOISES,There are too many noises in this CD and not enough theme. There was more theme in the film and God only knows why it's not on the CD. But what theme there is is quite good.
3,"The music is great, not the package....","I watched Face\Off at the movies several times, which I don't usually do. I belive it is the best motion picture ever. Right after I saw it I got the Soundtrack as fast as I could and was highly dissapointed. Although I listen to it all the time, and love the music (As an owner of over 15 Soundtracks, I think it is the second-best, right after ""The Rock"" Soundtrack). BUT, when I played the entire CD, I was highly dissapointed as a big movie fan! I execpted the songs ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"", ""The Big Ride""(I think that's the name)... And a few quotes like ""his face...off..."" If that's what you want, you'll probably feel like me. Dissapointed yet VERY much enjoing the music. Still, it is a dissapointement.. But the music is great... Oh well.. you make up your'e mind!"
2,what exactly makes this a soundtrack???!!,"I thought the soundtrack was completly lacking, oddly arranged and was missing alot of the songs i found in the movie. I think the composers had a lot to offer on a soundtrack which i will rarely buy if there aren't lyrics to the song- but i thought that the score of the movie was so powerful why not give it a try? I was completely let down. Watch the amazing movie and appreciate the music within while you can.~ erica, CA"
2,Xbox 360 NFL Denver Broncos Controller,"This controller works great for regular gaming. However, to play any type of game that requires a headseat with sound or microphone use the port where you put the headset is defective."
2,controller,"Overall the product was good, I would have prefered it if the description would have noted that the controller WAS NOT wireless. For XBOX360 you are led to assume the product is wireless."
5,Holds a charge nicely,"Works great, holds the charge well. The last one of these I had lasted ten years of consitant use, I'd be happy with half that for this price."
5,Maglite replacement battery,I have own several Maglites and have for many years. I used them when I was in Law Enforcement as well as at home. I have one in each of my three vehicles. The batteries have lasted for years and the ease of obtaining a new replacement one has been every ease. I am looking forward to many more years of use from the one I just purchased.
1,Never got it,"I have not received it yet, they say it should be here around 6th of November. That is 6 weeks, come on. Nothing and I say nothing has ever taken this long to get here and I will never buy anything from this store again. If it does not arrived by then I want my money return at once. The light bulbs I oerder came with in a week. Oh yeah they came from another store.John Ekstrom"
2,These batteries leaked for me,"My mag charger flashlight was working well a month ago, but today I tried it and it was dead. Put it on the AC charger, as usual, but after 8 hours it was hot (the flashlights body) so I tried the light (still charging), and nothing happened. Upon opening the tailcap, white powder dumped out, and the insides are totally corroded. Thankfully it didn't start a fire or explode. The flashlight is useless now. This was my second battery I've had but it leaked badly.ps - I always charged it for at least 12 hours, and this battery was obtained directly from mag instruments."
5,MagLight Battery,"Have only had the new battery for a few weeks, but, so far, it works as advertised. Actually, it isn't what I ordered; the Ni-Cad replacement battery. I received the newer NiMH battery instead. No problem, tho, as they say it works with the old charger, and it seems to do just that. I used my original Ni-CAD battery for close to 7 years, and it still works pretty good, but I've had to charge it every day for the past couple of years. I use my light for at least 30 minutes almost every night, and the new battery holds it's charge for several nights before I recharge. When these batteries discharge, they go dead all at once. There's no gradual discharge as with old batteries so don't get caught needing light with no way to charge-up. This is a great flashlight; the best I've ever owned, and these new batteries are doing their job. Only Time will tell if they're going to last anywhere near as long as the originals did."
2,Where's the feature?,"It's a menu of extras, fine in and of itself, but lacking in the meat of the show. I paid twenty bucks to see something different and I feel let down. I would like to see actual interviews with the designers and carpenters. I would like to know more about the departure of Alex (and Des). I want to know how to put together some of the more beautiful armoirs and shelves that Ty and Amy Wynn built. I want to see shopping lists so when I try to recreate some of the rooms in my own home, I know what to get at the store and which store to look through.I don't get any of that on this DVD. Even the reveal montages are available on the other Trading Spaces DVDs. Save your bucks unless you're a completist."
2,Where's the Beef?,"I felt like Clara Peller after watching this DVD. While promising bloopers, outtakes and such, it delivers very little. Most of it was just show clips that actually aired, which provides the hardcore fan (to who I assume this DVD is aimed) nothing much more than what had already aired? Where are the interviews? Where are the actual bloopers? where are the mishaps that had to occur over the 2 seasons?This makes a good rental disc at best. There is little if any rewatching value here."
2,"Would have been a nice ""bonus disc""","This disc has all the things you'd expect from a ""special features"" disc, but its missing the actual episodes. If you are obsessed with the characters on the show, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're like me and are hoping to get ideas for decorating, skip this one and wait until they release the seasons. I hope this isn't an indication of how the producers intend to trickle out bits and pieces of the show while charging fans a premium. Its a good show, but not that good."
2,Not Full Length Episodes!,"For some reason, I was under the impression that this DVD had full length episodes of Trading Spaces, but it is really only snippets of different episodes. It was not worth the money in my opinion."
2,Bad Designers,"This DVD is almost as bad as the show has become. 99% of the designers should all be castigated for being selfish, self-centered emotional ""artists"" who DO NOT take into consideration the lifestyles and tastes of the homeowners. Yes, they're working with neighbors, but the designers rarely if ever listen to what the neighbors KNOW their friends are looking for. Have you looked at the faces of people who walk into the new rooms?!?! The vast majority are stricken, feeling ill.Where do they find these designers? They sure aren't ""Christopher Lowell"". There is a way to meld your style as a designer to the client, and if totally at odds, the client should prevail. Boo hiss to this show. It's nothing but shock-value TV to me at this point."
1,lamelamelame,Why did they even put this out on DVD? Absolutely worthless. This is probably the most frivolous thing to come out on DVD ever. I'd rather watch a DVD with outtakes from a Mexican soap opera.
4,get it,"the book is very well written, thought out, informative and to the point. overall the author did a great job on the subject, however it seems there was a lot of room for further discussion. although i would almost consider the book a must for someone interested in learning the practice i wouldn't recommend using it as a sole source."
2,I would be astonished if you managed to summon a spirit with this book...,"...because the author doesn't tell you the most important fact about the summoning of spirits, and that is astrological timing. You cannot summon a spirit every night, but this is what the author pretends. The Goetia clearly states that spirits can only be evoked in the first two weeks after new moon, and only every second day. You can try to conjure a spirit due to the instructions in this book if you want (what I did several times), but I don't believe that you'll be successful. Konstantinos is an armchair theorist, not a practicing magician! By the way: If you write an e-mail to the author in order to ask questions on this book, I tell you that he won't answer."
2,"hmmm, not quite what I expected","Ok, SO I just wanted to touch on a few things that he really lacks on letting you know.First of all, If invoking was as easy as he makes it out to be, then we would not need books to do it. 2nd of all, The way he ""uses"" the Angels and such goetic spirits, I think is for pure selfish reasons, and I just got a terrible feeling from the book almost right away, But I usually give things a chance, but this book is just a great way to really get hurt in allot of ways if your really not careful, I would do the LBRP before and after reading the thing, Just my opinion."
3,a nice guideline for the beginning magichian,"I read this book as one of the first books on the occult.This is a basic all-common book,for anybody who wishes to enter the occult world.Any- one who read and kondem this book,should know that anybody have their own way of doing magick. After I read this book,and find it fascinating-not the book,but the knowledge it gives.After that you should looke into other books by more experienced magichians,such as G.D.,Alisteir Crowley,John Dee and Franz Bardon etc.No wonder that the book is a ""copy"" of the golden dawn.If you should know all these things in this book,you could be buying books for an eternity.There are so much materiale of the G.D. and other works on magic,that it's like a labyrinth.So in conclusion to all who are looking into the practice of evocation,should be master of invocation of some degree."
1,"This should be called, ""Evoking Spirits for Dummies...""","A very thin book (physically), with a shallow style of writing. ..Apparently (according to the author), evoking spirits is a VERY VERY EASY affair. In fact, if this book is anything to go by, then any six year old child with good reading skills, would be able to evoke spirits to perform wonderous works... indeed miracles perhaps...I was not foolish enough to buy this book. Rather, I looked at it in a ""new age"" bookshop. After seeing one/two pages, I could see that it was pure unadulterated rubbish."
2,fear to tread,"funny, there is much in this book, but the value of it liesalmost in the visualisation ritual alone. The author borrows from so many other sources that the ones of you with a firm occult base will find nothing new, much over-simplification and all understated. One feels that the author has a reader in mind, and that both do not seem to understand the actual reality and meaning of what is proposed. K. seems to find it a fine idea to say to every 'newcomer' ""here's a phonebook to some beings that can 'help' you with power, understanding etc.. free of cost, and if you would believe the author it would also be mere months before one invokes angels and other very very powerful beings.. Irresponsible and painfully obvious that even though the information has been given the wisdom is lacking in the giver..free of cost! a very irresponsible book."

We are planning to shock and entertain you and give you the living picture of these dark and forbidden lyrics from the twisted mind of Mess Anger.

4,Un ensayo de historia divertido,"Es un libro ameno, divertido que se lee en un suspiro. De una forma muy resumida el autor te proporciona una visión rápida y general de lo que ha sido España con detalles llenos de humor de como somos los españoles, como han sido nuestros gobernantes, con sus defectos y sus virtudes. No creo que el objetivo de libro sea hacer expertos en historia de España. Simplemente proporcionar un resumen general y hacer pasar un buen rato."
1,Not usable for a true Army Surplus Jerry Can,"The gasket is narrower than pictured. I have a real jerry can dated to the early 1950's. The original gasket is dried out and I tried this one. It does not work. It is too narrow to cover the small vent hole that is under the cap - so when the the lid or cap is screwed in the cap leaks. The idea is the vent hole is covered by the gasket when the cap is screwed in, but uncovered when the filler spout is screwed on. Whomever produced these gaskets donesn't know how the Jerry can works. The orginal gasket is more than twice as wide to make a tight seal over the vent hole with the cap."
5,Wonderful Poems,"Like an exquisite set of old dishes, used day in and day out, these beautiful poems slip up on you unannounced, slide into your consciousness quietly, so that you end up wondering whose idea it really was -- the poet's or the reader's. Artful language and ordinary days get mixed here into something full of stars, glinting with startling images, capering across a suddenly meaningful landscape, sliding so easily into the mind as not to be felt until the shock of recognition sets in. As the poet says at some point, you can eat these poems, drink them, and let them suffuse you own life with the warm satisfaction of a visit to someone else's brilliant kitchen."
5,A Truth Seeker Should Read This!,"For my type of a person, I was not quite attracted to the novel-style descriptive writing.. but God this book really gets your head around what it takes you to find your Master.It takes you a lot of sacrifices into preparing yourself to earn that rare occurrence of grace. Every truth seeker is looking for ""Theophane"", and only those who really deserve the honor... the Master will find him.This book is so mystical in nature and it opens a lot of possibilities in your mind, confirming how much ignorance there is in the world, and what's really going on the invisible spiritual world.Every truth seeker will enjoy this work indeed."
5,Great Workout,"I first started using this series back in 2000 when I had to lose weight to join the Air Force. I started with the Workout Challenge and gradually progressed to this one, which in my opinion, is the best one. I ended up losing 27 lbs. I recently started using the series again to help me with my stamina for Kickboxing and have lost 20 lbs. I've read other reviews that were negative and they seem to focus on the video quality. I think that people have to remember that this workout was filmed in the mid-90's. Overall, I enjoy the entire series, and more importantly, it works. The Industrial Strength PT is awesome for days in which you don't have enough time to complete the longer Burnout PT...and the Deathwish PT picks right up where the Burnout PT left off."
4,"Light, Small, Incredible Zoom, Easy Menus","The title says it all: Light, Small, Incredible Zoom, Easy Menus describes this camera.I don't know why there is only one review so far in 2008 when I am writing this to make two reviews on it.I bought this camera and was able to set it up and take pictures without even reading the manual. It takes good videos. The still mode requires adequate light. The digital zoom requires a tripod.I might give it 5 stars if it came with a firewire cable or if the still shots were better or if I had experience with other camcorders so as to have a basis for comparison. I haven't found any negatives yet at this price level.I also like the easy to use mode dial on the back of the camera. I can use the neck strap, put my right hand in the hand strap and rest it that way, control the on/off switch with my index finger, the mode dial and the start/stop button with my thumb all without even looking at the camera; it's very intuitiveand comfortable."
1,what do you mean by title,"I received both batteries in a timely manner but neither one worked. It was to near Christmas to do anything about the batteries and I became sick and still am, so that is why you did not hear from me before this."
4,Great Price,"During Hurricane Sandy all of our local stores were out of this battery or they were way over priced. I found them online for way, way less! Thanks!"
3,restless/ cluck old hen,love this and I have waited to get it. Enjoying the blue grass music. i would recommend this to anyone who loves Alison Krauss.
5,Listen for hours,"I don't listen to a *whole* lot of classical music, and pretty much no other solo piano than this. I bought this album years ago, and it is that rare music, where everything is good. As the other review notes, it's fine in the background. But whenever, and wherever, you tune in to it, pay attention to it, something good is going on. And: you can listen to it again next week, or next month, or next year, and find things you didn't find before. It's good piano music that doesn't have to be dazzlingly fast or difficult. And, Glazer touches the notes just right: more gently than you might have thought a piano note could be."
4,Very good book on Flame Painting,"I have known Rod Powell for over 35 years, and he is one of the best custom painters around. Rod is never afraid to try ""New Things"", which shows in his excellent flame jobs. I was in the custom paint manufacturing business for many years, and would bring samples of New Products to Rods shop. The book shows the proper techniques in laying out the patterns and masking the design. His use of 1/4"" masking tape for the design is the best way to go. I was a custom painter/pinstriper since 1955, and Rod's work has always stood out from the others. He worked a lot with Andy Southard jr, another well known pinstriper from the 1950s. I wish I had saved photos of my work as Rod has done, which shows creditability to his work. You can't miss on this book, even if you use spray cans. The technique is the same."
5,Rod Powell's Flame Painting Techniques,"Excellent book, with lots of coloured images and descriptions.Ideal for those who want to know the history of painting custom and tha artists of the old school."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"Seeing six albums on the cover of the book, I thought a lot more songs would be available. There was only 11 songs in the book. I'm a big Harry Chapin fan. I have all his albums, and all the CDs that are available. I was lucky enough once to see him in concert. If you are looking for a decent collection of Harry Chapin songs in one book, this isn't it."
3,Over Priced,"This is adorable, I have only been able to find it here and on another sight for twice the price. That said After only having it for a few months several of the charms had fallen off and been lost, I am purchasing another one I am not happy but this is the only place i can find anything like this. :/Here is an update I purchased the second one which also fell apart after only a short time, I have enough of the charms between the two of them now to create one, and will be bringing the two of the to a local jewelry crafter and having her make my a new one"
2,not really happy,"The bracelet was cute, however the packing was terrible. The bracelet almost fell out of the box when I received it. Also, it was not long enough. I feel like I overpaid for this product."
3,Big watch for big guys,Gave this as a gift for my brother. He adjusted the time every so often at the beginning but I guess that's how most automatic watches are.It's kinda heavy just the way my brother likes it. He got many compliments because of it.I just gave it 3 stars because the seller never replied to my inquiry. But the product itself was a good buy.
3,Has the basic music with some patter explaining the holiday,Nice sounding renditions of the traditional holiday favorites. Some songs are in english and some in hebrew or yiddish. There is a bit of patter with brief hoiday explainations which would make this a good CD for non-jews but I found the patter annoying after a bit. My kids (4 and 9) enjoyed trying to mimic the accents. I liked Just In Time For Chanukah (Margie Rosenthal and Ilene Safyan) better.
4,"good knife, seen better","This knife is a decent knife, wether you wish to use as a everyday tool, to witilling away some stick. It has a durable blade and stock. If you need a knife and you don't want to upgrade to an oldtimer, since you really don't need the extra duribility, this is the way to go."
3,Schrade Knife,Was excited to get the knife so quikly but was dissapointed in its workmanship--or lack of I should say. The center rivet protrudes out alot on both sides and I am not sure how to fix that. The blade never closed all the way and if you touched the end of the knife with your finger while the blade was closed it would cut you when it was in your pocket. I took a file and filed down the protruding part of the blade next to the hinge. Filed it approximatly 5/32nds and its ok now. Price was good but was dissapointed about those 2 items. Thanks....
2,Not very nice,"Sadly, this concert misses the magic of Nice, but features the worse attitude of Keith. You'll find better vibes in Nice reissues and Emerson plays Emerson recent cd."
4,The Nice is great - the Keith Emerson band sucks,"Half of this CD set is the Nice ""Live"" in 2002 and its great to hear our old pals Brian Davidson and Lee Jackson are still hanging in there. The Nice part is great but the second half of the CD set is the Keith Emerson band doing Nice stuff and all I can say is that if you cant do Nice nice, you shouldn't do Nice at all...............Still a ""must have"" for Nice fans."
2,Half as Nice as they used to be,"The album is really a vehicle for Emerson to showcase his career with The Nice (actually playing with The Nice) and ELP (without L or P). The first CD is material by The Nice and should've continued for CD two. Instead Emerson brings out a different band to play ELP material, which suffers from the lack of Greg Lake's voice. There was enough quality music produced by The Nice that they shouldn't have been pushed aside to play ELP music with other musicians. As a result, the project lacks focus and the energy that ELP produced.The production seems to be rather stilted, as if they simply set up the mixing board and walked away. Keith's keyboards always remain on the left and Dave's guitar is always on the right. Two words: Bor ing.CD1 is worth having, the remaining two are throwaways, which makes this overpriced. They had an excellent opportunity and only partially fulfilled it, apparently in order to satisy Emo's Ego."
1,PROBLEM ?,"THERE REALLY SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO, AS I HAVE ORDERED THIS TWICE.THIS IS ADVERTISED TO BE WITH A CAST OF PERFORMERS INCLUDING LIZA MINNELLI, SHERILL MILNES, GREGORY PECK PLUS MANY MORE.HOW DISAPOINTING TO FIND THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE, AND ALTHOUGH THE VIDEO IS ENTERTAINING, IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY PERFORMERS, APART FROM PRESIDENTREAGAN. NOT QUITE THE SAME ! I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THERE ARE TWO VIDEO'S WITH THE SAME TITLE.ANYONE ELSE HAD A PROBLEM."
1,Liberty Weekend 1986,"This was a complete ripoff. I expected to see the fantastic 3 hour show with guest stars, and sections on Hollywood, country music, Gospel music, and other genres. All I got was a 40 minute show with endless fireworks and a parade of ships. What a disappointment."
1,False Advertisingf,"I recorded this event in 1986. Unfortunately, part of the tape was erased. I wanted the complete three hour tape which included segments on every type of American music, not just the tall ships and endless firework displays. This VHS tape is a 40 minute fast compilation of what happened on that weekend, not the in depth presentation that I was expecting. I hope I can get my money refunded."
3,Liberty Weekend Commemorative Edition,"I was disappointed in this item. It was listed as LibertyWeekend by ANDY WILLIAMS. I knew that Andy Williams, the singer,sang at the Liberty Weekend event, so I thought the tape wouldinclude his performance. It did not.The tape was a beautiful display of the tall ships and the fireworks,but don't expect to see Andy Williams !"
1,Not particularly insightful.,"This book and this series is not to be mistaken for the highly acclaimed series of similar title, Your Eight-Year-Old, by Louise Bates Ames. This is 62 fairly thin pages filled with not particularly helpful insights such as ""Lots of girls now play soccer"" from a British author. While it may have relevance to the UK, the understanding and advice does not seem current to anything in the US. Read Bates instead."
5,A great overview of Christian Church history targeted to middle school student,"This book was initially lent by a friend, but it proved so useful in helping me prepare my late antiquity and medieval history classes for middle school students that I bought my own copy. The book is an easy read with helpful timelines along the tops of certain chapters. Issues like church versus state are clearly described. I have begun assigning readings in this book as I find it very useful for just regular Western European history."
1,biased and out of date,"I previewed this book, thinking it might be useful for a Church History course. I found it to be very biased, with a very narrow view, and also quite out of date. For example, the author refers to monks and nuns as being misled in their call to a life of celibacy - the author does not recognize that such a call might be genuine. The book has not been updated since the fall of the Berlin Wall - the Wartburg is referred to as being the home of some communist official, when in fact it has been part of the reunited Germany and open as a museum for many years now.I used another book for the course."
4,Pretty Good for the Pirce,Once I got through the confusing setup I have been pleasantly suprised by the sound and functionality of this system.Auto calibration is a snap but a bit tricky to setup manual calibration per speaker.Good value though for the price
2,Do not buy,It's that darn clicking noise. Every 10 seconds. It would be great except for that problem. However I am encouraged by the reviewer who said his went away without doing anything. If you are listening to quiet music it will drive you nuts!
2,CLICKING NOISE!!! ...in all speakers,"If the system worked perfectly, I'd say it's worth the money. There are plenty of inputs for analog/rca cables. A couple of component inputs and 2 HDMI pass-throughs. If you want audio in surround sound as any normal person would, you have to use either an optical or coaxial. So HDMI is not really HDMI. The DVD player works well, but slow. The up-conversion of DVD to 720p or 1080i is wonderful. Great picture. Overall sound is chinsey and missing mid's...There is a very big problem with the amp though... there is a damn clicking noise found in ALL speakers. I am either going to try to return the amplifier to Best Buy or have it fixed under warranty as other Amazon users have done listed below by Sony."
4,Model Is Being Updated in March,"Anyone looking at this page ought to know that on Feb 26, Sony announced 7 new home theater systems. One is the upgrade to this particular model, with the upgrade cleverly called HT-7100DH. The model is supposed to be available in March at the same price point. There's very little on the Internet about it yet besides the press release, but search for that model number and you'll get a few hits from engadget and gizmodo."
4,A must for any of Roger's long-time fans.,"This is not a CD for the casual listener, but is essential to the collections of all long-term fans of Roger McGuinn. The CD is, essentially, an up-close and personal musical seminar from the renowned folk-rock, Rickenbacker 12-string artist. Roger's roots are squarely in the folk tradition, and those roots have sustained his music for 4 decades. The CD largely contains live solo performances (there are two excellent studio ""bonus"" tracks with a fine backing band). The format for most of the CD has Roger introducing each song with personal stories relating to them. In his recent career, Roger has been returning to his fans a lot of the warmth and openness that they provided him during his earlier years, and this CD is reflective of that effort. Thanks, Roger."
4,representative of his concerts,"This is exactly what McGuinn is like live. He talks about the songs, preaches a little, connects with his audience and gives you a greatest hits show.If you are a fan of him (not the Byrds), this is a very good live album."
3,Live Solo Historical Concept Album Of Roger McGuinn's Musical Journey.,"Roger McGuinn's place in rock history is already secure via his membership and often leadership of my favourite band The Byrds.On this 1996 album he retraces his steps from Heartbreak Hotel all the way to May The Road Rise.The former is a rarity, as are Daddy Roll 'Em, Beach Ball and a studio track, Fireworks.While the concept is good somehow Roger's heart does not always seem to be in it.I know that sounds very negative, however some songs including Mr Tambourine Man (acoustic) and Mr Spaceman, are poor efforts, although Gate Of Horn and King Of The Hill are very good.Both studio tracks, Fireworks and May The Road Rise, are superior to just about everything that went before.In 1997 I saw Roger in London, an excellent concert well recieved, it's the CD which disappoints."
4,Enjoyable Beethoven,"I owned these performances on the Vox LPs over 40 years ago. I highly enjoyed them then and they are still quite enjoyable. If you can afford three budget sets those by Claude Franke, Wilhelm Kempff, and this set are a nice place to start. (I would suggest in that order) The complete sonatas can be obtained for about $40.00 All three performers are incredible in their very different interpretive styles. There are certainly many fulled price sets that are not as enjoyable as these sets. For Brendel fans you may want to consider the 35 disc set on Brilliant. It contains recordings made by Brendel for Vox AND Vanguard including music by multiple composers including the complete Beethoven sonatas. The CDs cost less than $2.00 a piece which is a great deal. I have not listened to this Brilliant set but one Amazon reviewer reports better improved sound quality. If you are an audiophile you may want to purchase other recordings but I find these particular Vox CDs very listenable."
5,CLARITY AND PASSION,"A.B. impresses me with his clarity, precision and rhythmic steadiness. Wonderful stuff! To me, his Hammerklavier conveys a remarkable sense of a man who comprehends the mood and intent of the piece. A.B. has a sure hand and a real passion - stronger for being understated. He's putting across a more Mozartian lightness here, but it works. Beautiful Beethoven!I have all 4 volumes of Brendel on VOX. Very fine. Also enjoy Arrau and Frank and O'Connor sets. They all have their special gift. (I'd probably pick the Arrau set if held at gunpoint and forced to pick one! But they're all superb - and you can't beat the material from the master, LVB.)"
2,A huge dissapointment,"I am big fan of Brendel. However, these CDs are a huge dissapointment. The sounds is very metallic and high pitched, whether it is due to the recording or the piano, I do not know. Brendel's interpretation is nowhere near the the subtlety, perfection and beauty I am used to. This is probably due to the fact that the recording was made in the early 60' when Brendel was still young and his play not as mature and experienced as it became later. i deeply regret purchasing these CDs (and Vol 2 too!)."
3,lukewarm,"For late Beethoven piano sonatas, Pollini and Solomon far excel Brendel, although Solomon's recordings are often of terrible sound quality. But Brendel's playing of Beethoven verges on urbane. Perhaps his predisposition to Mozart slightly infected his interpretation of other composers. Indeed, Brendel is best for Mozart and Schubert, not for Beethoven."
2,Too narrow!,"The overall fit of these shoes were fine, however they were way too narrow and I have a narrow foot! My toes hung off the edge and I had to return them."
3,Pretty good for what it is...,"I thought this movie had some genuinely funny moments. The movie never managed to be scary, but it worked well as a horror comedy. One of the female leads (the chick that plays the Playboy bunny) steals the movie about halfway through. This actress alone is worth the rental due to her quick, unexpected character change; you'll have to see the movie to understand what I'm talking about. Overall I thought this movie was kind of a ""Night of the Demons"" rip-off. It's worth a watch, but don't expect a great work of art."
3,Do you ever feel insane just because you laugh when someone gets decapitated in a creative way?,"Yeah, it's low budget, but still fun. There is the cheese, the whole ""fraternity hazes initiates and accidentally falls prey to a horrific evil plot"" routine, but the sheer creativity involved in this film more than made up for it. Make-up effects were alright, although there are some laugh-out-loud parts. The kudos to Bruce Campbell did not go unnoticed, nor did his influence here."
4,Brad Dourif fans,"I saw this movie originally when it first came out, just because Brad Dourif was in it. And while this wasn't one of his better movies, it was still worth watching. One of my favorite scenes was when one of the pledges was down in the basement to get the spellbook that was thrown. He encounters Professor Kapps' spirit (played by Brad), and Kapps gives him a good tongue thrashing. Implying that the guy can't even read English. Brad even does a pretty good British accent.This movie is somewhat like ""Night of the Demons"", but it manages not to be as...boring. If for nothing else, the humor alone holds the movie together."
3,The Hazing,"I enjoyed this movie. The writing almost hits its mark, and kudos for attempting to break stereotypes. Good cast, good supporting actors. Tiffany Shepis in a silver suit is a sight to behold. Not great, but fun all around. Defintely worth a watch."
2,"Spoof, Knock-off--what is it?","I watched this movie because it was supposed to be Brooke Burke's feature film debut.She's the incredibly-stunning babe from the E! Channel and I wanted to see her in a film role. If that's why you're checking this movie out, you need to keep this in mind: she appears in the first scene and then she's gone. She looks great. But then she's gone for the rest of the movie.The rest of the movie plays like the cheap campy horror flicks of the 1980s. In fact, it plays so much like one that it might as well be one.I liked the cast and, since we're using the 80s horror flick scale, the two girls look great naked, but there really isn't anything more here than we've already seen before. The script is definitely 80s slasher lame.I actually feel a little guilty because I watched the extras and everyone appears to be so earnest and energetic about this movie.Except the movie didn't turn out so cool."
3,The Hazing,"plot outline: a group of college freshman want to join and frat and sorority. But first they must go through a trial in order to be initiated into the club. That trial includes spending the night in a haunted house. Once the sun sets, bad things start to happen.this horror movie is a comedic take on the genre and has as many laughs as frights. I found it was more effective as a comedy than as a straight-forward horror movie.Brad Dourif and Nectar Rose have stand-out performances."
3,Pretty good,"Here in Aus it's called ""Dead Scared"" and I picked it up because I liked the look of Tiffany Shepis in the silver jumpsuit and I'm partial to a bit of shlock horror.From the outset it's pretty low budget with some of the special effects comming up short, and for me it wasn't quite gory enough, quite timid in fact.The characters are what you expect from American teen horror films and all the sterotypes were there, but none of the actors gave a bad performance which makes the film enjoyable, and there's a couple of unexpected twists which are a nice change.I enjoyed it and would soon watch it again. Good shlocky fun."
1,Drek,"This film was recently watched by the entire cast of my college play after the leader of the group watched it and was so amazed that he got everyone together and watched it probably to make him feel that he didn't waste his money on the rental. What was scary was his interpretation of the movie and recalling the certain elements. Eventually, after describing the movie to many different people in order to finally get them to come, it went from a bad movie to a gloriously over the top movie. I'm sorry, it's just a terrible movie. That's all I can say. One of the worst excuses to make a film in the history of film. Really bad plot and everything. It's a cheap horror/splatter film without the gusto of a genius like Peter Jackson, when he actually put lots energy into his films instead of making them overbloated bastardized versions of books and cheap Hollywood classic remakes. So please don't see this film."
3,A deserved recognition of forgotten actresses,"This reader has mixed feelings about Karen Burroughs Hansberry's ""Femme Noir."" On one hand, the author resurrects undeservedly forgotten actresses such as Peggy Cummins, Sally Forrest, Dolores Hart, Virginia Huston, Dorothy Patrick, and the wonderful Marie Windsor. On the other hand, one is tempted to question the inclusion in a book sub-titled ""Bad Girls of Film"" the likes of goody-two-shoes Jeanne Crain and even the aforementioned Dorothy Hart. In her necessary selection, Miss Hansberry included actresses who, granted, appeared in film noir but but whose roles were not noir at all. Instead of Dorothy Hart, for example, who usually played the nice wife, one might have chosen Ann Savage, the femme fatale of the quintessential B-noir, Detour. With that said, ""Femme Noir"" obviously belongs on the shelf of most film buffs."
4,One of the most gripping thrillers you can read,"Fond on books about serialkillers, this one grabbed me by the troath from page one. Mo can put herself on the same level with Thomas Harris (Hannibal) and Kathy Reichs (deja dead) Her style is very good and it takes the reader just a couple of pages of this book and you can't get it out of your hands until its finished. Her descriptions of character, crimescene and victims are chilling real. To consider this is her writing debuut, promises a lot for the future. She shows she has insight in the mind of a serial killer and probably has done intensive study at some of them. I would say that Jeffrey Dahmer was her favorite and that shows in this book. Go on, mrs Hayder, give us mo'.!"
3,Desgusting and graphic but other than that an average read.,Probably the most desgusting book i ever read.The book kind of dragged on a bit and really wasnt that exciting but if you have nothin better to do sit down and read this book and see how raunchy it is.
3,What Not To Do With Your Pet Bird,"Three words: Sex, drugs, and violence. If you are looking for a book about the majesty of birds, someone caring about birds like the ""birdman"" of Alcatraz, or a story about man and Gods beautiful creation then you have just purchased, are buying, checking out, thinking about..the wrong book. Birdman is a frightening tale of sick lust that starts off slow for a while then like a roller coaster plummets you down and through a twisting ride of fright. I was hoping for more info regarding why the birds were so important. But it did keep me turning the pages."
2,Ugly,"One reviewer said ugly....yes, this was an ugly little book. It felt like the author was trying too hard to draw readers into the story with bizarre descriptions...rude off the cuff conversation... I read a lot...at least 2 books a week...this would not be an author I would follow."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. At first I was very excited to order the book due to the reviews on line (which is why I continue to review - to give readers a true outlook on a book)This book is staged in Britain and it is very difficult to ascertain what they are talking about in the book unless you ARE british OR you have lived in Britain; because of this, I believe that you just can't get thru this book - you get held up trying to figure out what they are talking about."
3,Started as a page turner; gruesome details made it too gross,"I picked up the book because I am researching first time authors to learn what is now being accepted for publication and what the major houses are willing to gamble on when dealing with an unknown author. I learned that grossness sells. The story was well told for the most part but the level of sordid detail was not necessary to the story. The ending was extremely weak and I felt as though the author had read a ""how to"" book that dictated all the loose ends must be dealt with before the reader finishes the last page. The ending was not satisfactory on any level. The book will do well with those readers who like the sordid killer mentality. It may even be a good movie but the subject matter really turned me off."
2,Too grisly for me,"The writing was OK, the story moved along without any surprises, the bad guys were disgusting, the violence, as is often the case these days, was far too graphic."
4,A Good Read,Plot and characters believable and involving. A good read in all areas and recommended to all thriller and police procedural devotees.
5,A Definite Pageturner,"Mo Hayder has definately gotten off to a good start as a writer. Birdman kept me up late at night reading page after page, dying(hah) to know what would happen next. Hayder does a good job of tying together different plot structures without making the book cumbersome for the reader or confusing. For those that say that the book was too gory, I'm sorry but there's nothing pallitable about murder(s). Cant wait for her next one to arrive."
4,Awesome Suspense!,"Mo Hayder can write. Plain and simple. I could not get enough of this book. I was sucked in, shaken up a bit and spit out. All the ""cast iron stomach"" comments are partially correct in my opinion. Although after reading a Jack Ketchum book (first and last), Mo Hayder's violence is mild by comparison. ""Birdman"" is dark and disturbing. It's supposed to be and Ms. Hayder is an expert at drawing the suspense and menace to a palpable state. Her characters live and breathe and while hopefully you cannot relate to them, you care about them. Excellent knack for allowing the reader to actually ""see"" what's happening. Check out Mo Hayder..."
4,Not for the faint of heart,"As other reviewers have stated, if you are at all squeamish you would be wise to give this book a pass. The descriptions of murder and mutilation are graphic and disturbing to say the least. That said, this is a well written page turner that had me guessing all the way through. We meet Detective Jack Caffrey, young, handsome, clever and tormented. He appears to have met his match with a serial killer whose sheer brutality and perversion are almost unthinkable. I especially liked the side story pertaining to the disappearance of Jack's brother, and how it relates to his creepy neighbor. Jack's relationship with his girlfriend Veronica gives new meaning to the word dysfunctional! So if you think you've got the stomach for it, by all means go ahead with Birdman, you won't be disappointed."
5,Excellent first book.,"I just finished this book, and, although the subject matter is distasteful,horrifying,gruesome and terrifying...it is so well written that I kept at it until the end.I'm glad I did.This new author,Mo Hayder, can proudly take her place with the best of 'em..Thomas Harris,watch out!! New blood(pardon the pun) on the horizon. It's a wild ride,on a road with many an unexpected turn. It will stay with you long after you finish it, I guarantee.I am eagerly awaiting her next book. Way to go, Mo!!"
3,"wonderful story, sad ending",The thriller had me one the edge of my seat. So much so that I finished the book in two days only to be left unfulfilled at the end. Hayder had many storylines going and unfortunatly something had to give. The ending did not offer enough closer on the issue of the main characters brothers death. Overall great story just wish the ending was a bit more fulfilling
4,Graphic and fast paced,"I have been waiting and waiting for this book. I finally finished it in 2 days. It was a great book. Mo Hayder made a fantastic debut with this novel.I must warn you though, you need a strong stomach for some of the very very graphic scenes that Hayder's describes. In fact one was so awful, I actually felt nauseous. Nonetheless the plot is fantastic and well constructed.I can't wait for the next one."
3,A Good Creepy Read...,"Birdman is an entertaining read - it's not high-art or the pinnacle of literature in the early 21st century. So, don't expect it to be. Having said that, its a good ride.Taking a page out of the Thomas Harris Workbook for Thriller Authors, Hayder develops a very twisted plot structured around a string of serial killings in London. The characters are well developed. The relationships between characters play out predictably but there are enough twists, turns and surprises to outweigh some of the book's shortcomings."
3,Too much fluff,"The entire time I was reading this book I felt like I was reading in circles. The premise is great, the characters were real, but the book didn't need to be 400+ pages. The story wasn't very organized. The killer is revealed 3/4 of the way through the book. It's a pretty grusome read if you're into that. This is the first I have read by the author. I'll give him another chance. But it's got to get better than Birdman."
2,Fly away Birdman.,"Yipes. What an ugly little book this is. Not that the gruesomeness affected me so much but the fact that someone has not only tried to stake out Thomas Harris' territory but also his terse, diamond-like prose. And not done it very well either. That is the core of my complaint: It's a been-there, done-that situation told in a manner that is not entirely original. Sorry."
4,good book with an intellectual approach,"As a relative beginner (orange belt level now), I found this book helpful in explaining further the nuances in all our moves as well as adding depth to my understanding of karate. It was both informative and an easy read. It was also quite nice that one could read particular sections at a time, ie, one didn't have to read progressively from start to finish."
5,Awesome Material,The DVD is packed with moves in the self defense realm. Its geared toward police officers and is easy to relate to. The lessons move right along but with some note taking and instant replays you can master the moves quickly.Worth every penny!!!
1,There's something wrong with this.....,I agree with a few other reviewers - there is something different about this. Maybe it is a bad batch - it doesn't taste like the easy mac or the other mac and cheese. It has a weird taste. I think I'm getting rid of it.
5,love this stuff,"I just bought $50 worth of this stuff ($10 off if use 'grocery2' coupon code). I'm looking forward to gorging myself on it, considering I have no other food."
4,"Great, quick way to strip paint off an old garage...",My parents had one of these about twenty or so years ago. I was in need of something that would strip the paint off an old garage. I went looking for this type of stripping tool accessory for a drill or grinder. This worked great. Stripped the paint off of a two car garage in about 2-3 hours and was able to paint it the same day.
3,Ehhh,"It does work, but I think it really beats the crap out of the wood - I expect these would be really nice on metal to remove rust or old paint better than wood if your trying to keep the wood in any shape. And I tried these for both the fine and course."
4,deck stripping,"My indoor three season deck had cheap carpet glued to it. I pulled off the old carpet. This coarse Roto Stripper worked well to remove most of the glue and paint, but the process was somewhat time consuming and created much dusts. There were thick glue patches which required extra scrapping using a conventional paint scraper. Roto Stripper does take some wood off the deck surface. This device is very loud when scrapping against the wood deck. Earplug is highly recommended. I will also need to belt-sand the deck surface afterwards. I heard this type of stripper is not being sold in major hardware stores because the wires could potentially break off, shoot out like darts and cause severe harm. Be careful."
1,A treasury of misinformation,"Firstly, I would like to summarize my credentials for writing such a harsh review: I am a quasi-native speaker of Spanish, having learnt the language at the age of five and lived a total of more than twenty years in six different Spanish-speaking countries. Furthermore, I am a federally certified court interpreter for Spanish and have become acquainted with the speech patterns of all Spanish-speaking countries without exception.Now Ms. Berger clearly is unable to construct a correct sentence in Spanish. Much of her pseudo-Spanish is a crude translation from French and/or Italian. She does get some things right, but spoils it by failing to specify where such words and phrases are used. Cusswords are among the terms which most vary from country to country. A Spaniard curses completely differently from a Mexican or Argentine.All in all, a waste of time and money."
1,This book consists of what its title suggests: Mierda,"This form does not allow a rating of NO STARS, so I had to give it one, even though it doesn't deserve it. For someone who really wants to learn ""dirty"" idioms in Spanish, Street Spanish (published by Wiley) is MUCH, MUCH better. Frances de Talavera, in Mierda, goes for shock value ONLY and many times gets things wrong. Street Spanish, on the other hand, focuses on many idioms which people actually use, plus it contains a section on how to avoid saying something embarassing (or unintentionally obscene)."
1,This is Spanish profanity and how to speak it! Disgusting!!!,"This is almost ""hard-cord"" street Spanish and if you are looking for help with basic language skills, look at other titles!"
3,"Works fine, but the audio cables are too short.","These cables are, well, cables. There's not a lot else to say about that part. They work fine. The three stars are for that part.The missing extra two stars are for my gripe: the audio cables are just a little shorter than the DVI part. Since the DVI part is the thicker, stiffer portion of the cable, using this cable in cramped quarters can cause the audio plugs to pop out of the jacks. Minor irritation, but a oversight that could have been easily avoided. The audio plug was the one that gave me the most trouble; I solved the problem by purchasing a 3"" extender cable from Radio Shack."
3,DOUBLE CHECK - May not fit your computer,"I purchased this along with a KVM switch that was DVI-I but my computer was DVI-D.Step 1: Check both your comptuer graphic card and see if you are DVI-D or DVI-I. [...]Step 2: Then check to see which DVI interface is on the KVM switch.Other than that, I think the cables are just fine."
4,"Decent product, but not what I required","This is probably a decent enough headset, but didn't work with the radios we have at work, due to the lack of a PTT button. My fault, I suppose, for not reviewing the description carefully enough, although were more information provided that might have been avoided. In any event, it did stay securely on my head until I took it off."
1,Not worth it,"Not worth it. A lot of common sense presented in a very tedious, boring way. Turns you off against writing anything."
2,WHAT VERSION OF DAVID COPPERFIELD?????,Only two stars because this entry give too little information. Does anyone know what version of David Copperfield this would be? I'd like to know before buying the item. Is it the Freddy Bartholomew/WC Fields version?
4,Well-written with minor complaints.......,"Excellent parellels between our society and the setting for ""Golden One"" ......The dangers of a class system run amuck, a decaying infrastructure......Unlike a previous reviewer, I thought Ampris' story was more convuluted and interesting (What constitutes being a ""person"" etc...) My only real complaint is that the races are too doglike, catlike, lizardlike, bisonlike, ratlike, etc. etc......It's hard to see beyond these too familiar traits to see the real character...The themes they represent are recocnizable enough."
1,"Predictable, boring, and it aint SF.","This book really sucked.1. It is not science fiction, and hardly even fantasy.2. The story is not compelling even a little.3. The characters are not interesting, and I felt no compassion for them.I can't believe that they think that they can squeak another 8 books out of this no-brainer. The entire tri-triology is completely predictable from the opening paragraphs of the book. The story is nothing but a cheap rehash of the same story told much better many times. Ever heard of Ben-Hur. Call the slave races moors and turks instead of dogs and cats and it's the same thing only of much lesser quality.In the future I will be careful of the following, and I recommend to all to do the same:1. Don't buy a book that tells you it's the first of nine. They've already decided that there is some merit in a story that no one has read yet.2. Don't buy anything that is labelled a ""collaboration"".3. A book by a movie studio?"
1,insipid trash,"Did I read the same book as everyone else here?I bought the book while waiting for a flight, and as bored as I was I could not finish this outright rip off of other novels.Don't fall for the Lucas name as I did.Perhaps the other reviewers are either very very young or have never read a worthwhile sci fi / fantasy book.Instead allow me to suggest Frank Herbert - Dune, Isaac Asimov - Foundation, Robert Jordan - Wheel of Time series 1 to 6 only, or my newest favorite George R.R. Martin"
1,Once in a great while,"a book comes along that really inspires you... to vomit. Of the many books of sci-fi schlock I've poured through in my lifetime, this one is one of the worst. The characters are rarely interesting and the plot seems thin and in the end of this book, rushed. It seems by the 170th page of boring melodrama the author was in such a hurry to cut it short to fufill ""trilogy"" requirements she railroaded the characters into confusing and counter-intuitive behavior. I re-read the last part of the book to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and I wasn't. I haven't bothered to read the next two books in the saga. Usually, a first installment of a saga is supposed to grip you, not repulse you. And this did such a wonderful job of repulsing me I refused to even continue with the series. Instead, I reread ""Dune"" and found my faith in sci-fi writing restored."
5,Star Wars like (what it may have been like pre-Rebellion,"Another galaxy, another time. Several alien races, all fuzzy, enslaved by evil reptiles. It sounds like a typical plot, but it really is unique. There is something about this book that puts it apart from others. For one thing, the author, Deborah Chester, did not include humans. Thus, the reader enters the storyline with unbiased attitude (sorry for the pleonasm). However typical this sounds, you will be actually sucked into its storyline and the lifes and trials of different non-Viis and non-Ampris species characters, feel their triumphs and indignitations, and will put the book down only when you finish, begging for more, which will come in the sequel."
5,I have seen few books that come close to Golden One.,"Golden One takes you to another world. If you think it is just like all the others that have other worlds in them,think again. The Viis are the rulers. They want a good life and an empire that will outlast all others but they are short sighted and can forget crucial details. Israi is the sri-Kaa.She is second only to the Kaa, ruler of the Viis. Ampris was taken in by Israi when he was at a very young age. Ampris is an Aaroun. Considered a slave race. So the tale begins of how Ampris lead The Great Emancipation and conquered the Viis. This book tells how he grew up and his life before the revolt. In my opinion this book is one of the greatest ones Deborah Chester has ever written."
5,wonderful sci-fi novel,"I'm not the usual sci-fi lover, but I was attracted to everything both in and out of the book. the plot is excellent, the characters seem almost alive in our minds and I have only one question, already asked by many other readers: when will the 2nd book be released????????"
5,Definately worth the read!,"The author paints a fascinating world with just the right touch of character development and just enough action and intrigue to keep you reading without wasting trees and ink on every silly detail. All too often, authors try to paint too vivid a picture of the world they're creating, spending entire chapters explaining why a character likes to twiddle their thumbs. Fortunately, Deborah Chestor is an excellent author who can tell a rich, full story without boring you for even a page. Although I don't like the fact that I'll need to wait for many months for the next book, it will be worth the wait."
4,ALIEN CHRONICLES,"THE ENTIRE TRILOGY IS A MUST READ. YOU GET ""TAKEN INTO"" THE STORY LINE AN CHEER WITH THE OTHER SPECTATORS FOR ""CRIMSON CLAW! """
4,"Ransom's score was good, but not Horner's best...","James Horner's score for this movie does a good job underscoring the film. His music reflects the way the film's character are feeling. It also helps build up the tension in this movie. I like how Billy Corgan's ""Kidnappers"" music was include on this soundtrack. It offers and altnernative to those who think that James Horner's score ""sucked""."
2,Horner's music for RANSOM,This is no where near as goor as TITANIC. There is probably about 4 or 5 good songs on the soundtrack to RANSOM. It's better used as a frisbe to play catch with. Clay
1,One of the worst in my CD collection,"I played it once. I love the works of James Horner, but something clearly went wrong here. This is not his style and it shows."
3,Half Good,"This is a really good score in the film, and the soundtrack album is okay. It gets just an ""okay"" for several reasons: 1- As usual, not enough of the music is on the CD, and, the greatest detractor... the terrible Billy Corgan noise for the last half of the cd. The beginning is some great James Horner music, but Corgan sounds like amature noise that I could creat in about thirty seconds in a simple music compositon program (I have, in Fruity Loops). I am really tempted to rip my copy of this cd and throw out all of the noise (Corgan's stuff) and make a good, listenable soundtrack to James Horner's score for Ron Howard's ""Ransom""."
4,Ransom(1996 Film) [SOUNDTRACK],"James Horner is by far my favorite film composer, but I must be honest, I love this CD because of Billy Corigan. He is the true artist on this soundtrack. Every new venture for him is grand, not only with lyrical work-the Smashing Pumpkins-but also with score. I belive Billy Corigan could make a painless transition to film score just a easily as Danny Elfman did."
3,It would have got 5 stars if it would be just half of it,"Ah.. mr. Corgan, you've done it again! If Billy Corgan would have to write a bad song to save his life, he'd die! THIS MAN IS GOD!! HE CAN'T FAIL!! Horner sucks though! he gets the minus 2 stars"
3,Good value but NO BLADES!,"I bought this with the misconception that it came with both 66 and 110 blades. It comes with none, although it is a durable tool at less than half the price of others.Just be prepared to order any blades you need for $10 to $20 apiece + shipping."
4,Life & love in virtual reality!,"This movie was made and released on vhs in 1995, then in 2003, was transferred to dvd. It was didgitally mastered so it looks really good. I'm afraid the woman on the front cover isn't in the movie, but don't worry as there are several great looking gals that are in it. This is a very well done soft porn film, with many ""scenes"", plenty of nudity and some pretty good acting and plot. This is the 87 minute ""R"" rated version, that has not been cut. The movie was done with taste and class, nothing vulger or demeaning. It is also good to see the mid-1990's in clothing, appliances, and just general living conditions. Check it out."
4,"A fun flick, but be aware of which version you're buying","The version detailed above is the unrated ""87-minute"" one...the other is highly edited ""78-minute"", with toned-down sex scenes compared with the original. It doesn't change anything with regards to the plot, really, but if that isn't your primary reason for watching this movie, it can make a difference. The plot is kind of cool; the protagonist is a (attractive, smart) computer geek who, after her boyfriend leaves her abruptly, dies in an accident while plugged into her virtual reality program. Awakening in an afterlife that has windows into the live world through virtual reality, Mara discovers that she has to ""visit"" live people to help them, and to learn her own lesson along the way. A nice re-imagining of a kind of purgatory for the modern world, with some good (if corny) ethical lessons."
2,",,,... Umm...","Wasn't quite sure about this, lost interest so quick that I thought to myself "" Why did I put this movie in again?"""
2,Not all media!,"I bought this product with the intent of using it to backup my files to my HP CD writer. No where does it indicate that this is not recommended. Now that I am using it, I find my computer constantly locking up or slowing down. Then it cannot save some files, even though I have excluded them from the backup, it still tries to back them up and every 2 minutes I get 2 error messages indicating that these files cannot be backed up. It is totally frustrating. If you plan to use this with a CD Write, think again."
5,"Newman is good, if a bit flamboyant","That's what our church organist (Ph.D., Eastman) said when I asked him about Newman, after I had bought and enjoyed the above recording. (I have heard so many BAD recordings of the Toccata and Fugue in D minor that I was relieved to hear it played sensibly on this wonderful CD.)I'm sorry if one reviewer didn't like Newman's added notes; he should look up 'ornaments' in the Norton/Grove concise Encyclopedia of Music - or listen to contemporary soloists in Handel's Messiah for ornamentation in the spirit of the Baroque and classical eras.Is the recording dry? Yes - but it's not muddy, as cathedral organ music is. Every week I sit five feet from a 22-stop tracker action organ built in the North German style and hear glorious music, often Bach, performed impeccably. Our church seats 300 and doesn't have cathedral acoustics - I still get a thrill from Bach, played well."
1,Simply terrible,"Mr. Newman plays with the accuracy and passion of a machine. This recording is truly lifeless. At the very least, he plays way too fast as so the listeners ears are only assaulted briefly."
5,AWESOME BURRIS Window Mount,"This unit is a ""must have"" for anybody watching or photographing anything in the outdoors. Forget the cumbersome tripods. This unit can be stashed in your glove box in your RV and be available in an instant. Can be used with a camera with long focal lenses that need to be dead steady, or spotting scope, or any optic that has threads to be mounted. Don't even need to get out of the rig. Just mount to the window, roll up or down to the right position, finish dialing in with the mount adjustments and lock in. Simple to use. Can drive to the next spot of interest with it still mounted to the window. If you have ever ended up with a blurry picture because you jumped out of your rig at the spur of the moment, hand holding a camera with a 400mm lens attached, or missed the shot because you were trying to set up a tripod, then this is for YOU! amazon.com always has the best prices."
4,A Great Seaside Chronicle,"Millions of city dwellers visit the Maryland Eastern Shore every year on vacation, but few know anything about the seaside heritage beyond breakers, french fries and Boardwalk thrill rides. The Maryland coast has a long and rich history, told by Mr. Patton in a most engaging, almost folksy, fashion. The Pattons have lived less than a mile from the sea for generations, progging for clams, dipping soft shell crabs, hunting and forming the backbone of a proud race of shoredwellers that fiercely preserves its traditions. Patton's book is an easy read - almost like a good novel. His short poems that open each chapter are lyrical and expressive. His book reminded me of many other books of the genre, notably ""The Rivers of the Eastern Shore,"" by Hulbert Footner, an Eastern Shore classic. This book belongs in any collection of Maryland history, coastal ecology or especially Delmarva lore."
5,Awesome boxing and grappling shoes,"I got these shoes to wear in a boxing ring when I box or grapple and they are pretty amazing. They have the best qualities of both wrestling and boxing shoes. (grip and flexibility). Obviously if you were really into boxing you would want more ankle support but for just sparring and mitt work, they are great"
5,Kung Fu you,I don't do Kung Fu or any other martial arts but I have to say these are nice shoes especially for the price. They have a lot of cushion and feel very comfortable. They're lightweight as well. I wanted shoes that were as minimal as possible but durable and these do fit the bill. The only two issues that others have stated too are the rubber smells and the soles are rounded. 2 thumbs up.
2,Beware of sizing,"The shoes seem very good for boxing or general gym usage. The only problem I have is the shoes sizes. I usually wear 10.5 - 11 size shoes (Nike and under armour) and I went to [...] to match my shoe size into American sizing: Size 45 = 11 US. However, when I did receive my shoes they were a bit big on me so I had to return them. I had to pay another $15 to UPS to exchange them for a size 44 - 10.5 US. I got the new shoes, but they were still a bit big on me to the point that I could easily slip my index finger in the back of the shoe even while I'm wearing socks and shoe inserts. The seller was very professional and responded quickly to my messages. I was disappointed the shoes weren't a perfect fit again. I'm not willing to pay another $16 for a second exchange. Maybe it's just me, but just make sure you get the right size."
5,"Helpful sizing input, maybe?","First, I agree with most reviewers. Good shoes for the money. I do Tai Chi and think they're just fine.Now on the sizing ... I normally take between a 9 and 9.5 men's size. Usually I go to 9.5 but it's often a bit large. Anyway, I took a flyer and got the Size 9 (42) men's. To my delight, they fit just right. I definitely need to point out they are too tight for me when worn with normal cotton althletic socks. They're a good snug fit -which is what I imagine you want - with no socks or with thin polyester/nylon-type socks.Hope this helps my fellow Amazonians. I usually assume that any shoes I get online won't fit but this time I got lucky.P.S. If you're unfamiliar with this type of shoe, these are probably nothing you'd want to walk a couple miles in. I sure wouldn't. Very thin soles with rounded edges, no arch support, etc., etc. Exercise floor use only, I think."
4,great training tool,"After reading about benefits of simulating barefoot training, I decided to try these low tops to strengthen my arch and avoid damaging my heel when I run. In a short time I was able to run backwards on the treadmill, which is a great workout in which you avoid landing your heel. I believe that my agility has vastly improved from going sideways and backwards on the treadmill."
1,Wear shower shoes instead...,"Don't let some sifu con you into buying these things. They're incredibly junky. Sloppy fit, bad smell, cheaply put together, heavier than you really want for martial arts. Plus return is a hassle--you have to pay for return postage.You're better off working out in a pair of Totes house slippers. Seriously.I only gave one star because the program won't allow you to give zero stars."
2,Wrong Color,"I ordered the black Gunfu shoes, size 41 and received a pair of whites instead.When I checked online to make sure I didn't make a mistake, I found that everything involved with the order had them marked as black -- the item page, my shopping cart, orders history page, the packaging on the box. Only problem was that the shoes were white. Further, from what I've found thus far, I can't return them in any way shape or form."
1,By Tiger Claw??,"Fei Yue Shoes definitely not by Tiger Claw, these are made in china long before tiger claw USA. And each costs 1 or 2 bucks wholesale, that's 5 or 6 bucks max retail.Crappy shoes you can feel every contour of the ground on your feet. Put an insole to make them bearable. For 5 bucks ill go for it but 15 or 20 please tiger claw just because you put a bag with your name on it doesn't make it your own."
2,Idk if they are worth the price,I bought them for parkour training shoes. First 20 min I was training I tried 2 cats and a few precisions. Well that ate the bottom up fast. I quickly put on my ko and was happy again. But by then the bottom has about 2/3 left on it. And the grip was horrible and felt like I was just sliding down the wall. When I got then they were tied around each other which made the bottom very rounded. This made it very weird compared to barefoot which is why I got them to be close to barefoot training.Not if your just freerunning or actually use them for what they are made for I'm sure they are a decent shoe. But for parkour they are completely crap.
4,"Unobtrusive, nearly barefoot feel. Great traction. But low durability.","I don't do parkour or kung fu or any of that stuff. I just got these for general use. The soles are flexible and soft rubber. So this gives you great traction and a sensitive feel, but it also means the tread will wear down much more quickly. The soles aren't flat, but convex. Gives you an interesting sense of your weight distribution and balance. These are by no means high quality shoes. Just some canvas glued crudely to some rubber. But if you need something that requires great traction, it generally comes with a fast wearing sole. So likely the sole will be eroded before any wear to the rest of the shoe is apparent anyways. I generally wear a mens 8.5 or 9, and found the size 42 to fit pretty well. There are international shoe size charts all over the net if you are having trouble deciding."
4,Feiyue martial Arts snhoes,"I got these for Tai Chi. I use them both inside and outside in the park. They feel just right, enough stability but flexible with good traction but also easy to make turns. they're the most comfortable shoe i've ever had for daily practice. I highly recommend them to Tai Chi players"
4,Nice shoes for the price,"I just got these today in white. The picture is accurate. The canvas material is light, almost more a twill. The heels is like a brick design... high/low alternate. The toe area treads looks like the siding on a house design.The toe & heel bottom is actually thicker then my running shoes I bought recently. Still much lighter then most US sneakers & still flexible bottom which is great. There is some good squishy? foam? cushioning in the heel to make it as thick as most US sneakers.You can see a thick line of glue along the rubber toe portion and along the entire area the canvas meets the sole on the sides.I'm airing them out now, I don't remember any arch support, but you can always buy an insole. I felt I had way too much room width wise, but I wasn't wearing socks & I think these are designed for men."
4,Kung Fu Wushu Shoes,"These shoes are working well for me. I practice Degerberg Blend. There are two areas where the shoes bother me (but just a bit).The shoelace eyeholes can grate against my foot on the interior of the shoes, especially on roundhouse kicks. Be sure to cover the eyeholes with the canvas provided inside the shoes. Its very easy for these to become folded & not provide coverage.Also the lack of laces or means of securing the shoe to the heel, as its just canvas around the heel. I often feel like they're going to fly off, although they never have.These are minor comments to optimize the shoes, and not really necessary since they cost $15. They've worked well in numerous sessions, and I plan to continue wearing them."
5,feiyue parkour,the feiyue martial arts shoe is an amazing parkour shoe although it has little cushioning it holds up great against wall runs cat grabs and other movents like them. the shoe grip wears down fairly easily but when it is worn down the grip is still phenominal and the flexibility on the shoe is topo notch for balance and pricisions i would recommend these shoes for any EXPERIENCED tracuer
4,Shoe is great,"this shoe has one of the best fits i have ever felt, like a sock. the grip is good but will wear away fast if you are climbing up walls."
2,Received Wrong Size,The shoe quality is fine. But I ordered a size 34 = Boys 3 US and it the shoe says 37/235 on it. It's VERY BIG and unwearable. I can not find how to contact the seller to get another new smaller pair. Will not purchase from this vendor again.
4,Feiyue Martial Arts Shoes,"I don't use them for martial arts, but around the house almost like slippers which they work well for. They aren't designed for walking around town in, you can, but you'll wear out the soles rather quickly. Comfortable."
3,Great for the price...,"I was wearing the minimus from newbalance and was looking for a minimalist shoe and stumbled upon this. For about twenty bucks this is definitely worth it, but you can tell that you paid quite a bit less by the quality and durability of this shoe. The price is the best thing about this shoe, it isn't very stylish, and it feels a bit cheap. I wear a 10.5 in the US, so I thought a 44 would be a pretty good guess at what I'd wear but I should have gone with a 43. I scrunched up a paper towel in my shoes to make up for getting the size too big and it fits much better. Definitely worth the buy at $20, but don't expect anything close to the other minimalist shoes."
4,Great shoe for Kung fu,"I wear these when we train outside, they are light and comfortable, great for wushu training."
2,"Too Narrow, Sole too round","I like the concept, but they just don't fit my feet. My foot is 10 inches long and 4 1/4 inches wide at the ball. These shoes are just too narrow at size 43. After wearing them for half of a plyometric workout, I tried the rest without and my feet were cramping from being so confined. I also tried a size 44 while practicing kata; they were long enough that I had to be careful not to slip my foot out.As far as the sole is concerned, I could get over the squishy feeling, but probably the rounded hump in the middle of the foot."
3,Pretty good,"The shoes are comfortable, but I am not a fan of the rounded sides on the soles - it makes it tough on some Tai Chi moves. Also, they have a distinct petroleum smell."
3,big for size,"OK, the shoes are fine and expecially for the money. the first pair I ordered, were so huge for my son who actually does martial arts that I had to find someone else who could wear them. My son liked them tho, so I ordered another pair a full size smaller and they were still big but wearable. I think if they actually fit,they would be a great shoe"
5,Great Shoes,"My son loves these shoes and wears them every day. They're a great buy, shipping is really fast. I'm a repeat customer!"
4,Great for Kickboxing Fitness,I use these for my CKO Kickboxing Fitness classes and they work great. The only issue is they don't really provide much ankle support so if you're doing things like 8 point burpies and jumping jacks you might want running shoes for those but these are great and the price is AWESOME. I am even getting them in white for outside the gym!
4,Good for tai-chi,"Good for their intended purpose. Not a great daily walk-around shoe, although I use them for that when the weather is nice, which in Western PA is about 4 days per year. I am an almost perfect size 9, and I buy size 42's. I am an E or EE width, and they are fine for me. A narrow foot may have some extra space up front. If you are used to heel-hugging insoles your heels are going to feel a bit neglected back there.Don't expect them to make you any taller; the heel rise is close to zero."
3,Tiger Claw Wushu sizing is a bit small,"I ordered a size 43 for my size 10 (American men's) feet after consulting several different sizing charts. The shoes are at least two sizes too small, more like size 8 or 8.5. The shipping charges to return the shoes will be more than they cost, so instead of returning them I will be donating them to someone needy. They seem like pretty good cheap shoes otherwise. Quality is not great, but neither is it poor. I will try ordering a larger pair in the future."
5,best choice,have been using this shoe for awhile now order a other pair good for any kind of marital art practice just not kung fu very light and good price better then the more pricy brands
5,Great Shoes!,I own and heavily use a pair of New Balance MT 1010 Minimus. I bought them because they were light and flexible. Sadly after just 4 months of heavy use my left shoe has started to tear. I still use them as only the top layer has started to tear. I wanted to get another pair I could wear when I didn't need the support of the NB's. These shoes are lighter than the NB's and I find them very comfortable and they are also being used as my driving shoes and really just my go to shoe. I will be buying several more pairs in different colors as these shoes have become one of my required items. I will update on durability.
4,Excellent shoes for the price,"I use these for fencing, and while they don't last as long as actual fencing shoes, they are a hell of a lot cheaper. If you use them for kung fu, they will last a lot longer also. They last me a year or so before I have to replace them."
4,Diggin them but be careful,"These are great training shoes. I am experimenting with them in all my gymnastics and track training as I want something with a more minimal design. BE CAREFUL THOUGH!!! Training in a minimal shoe make muscle work in ways they haven't and its easy to be laid up a few days from a leisurely run. It's not the shoes fault, but take it easy at first. So far I love them. I'm a size 12 and saw that 46's were my conversion but they were too snug even without socks. Make sure you are sure on the size conversion as I had to bump up a size. as far as feel they are great! There isn't any squeezing of the toes and they are extremely grippy and responsive. I got them through the martial arts store here and would recommend them to any one. Big thumbs up on these!"
2,Ohhhh,"The shoe is confortable, but when you start walking in it you feel this bump right in the middle of the foot. Is like you are walking on a half sphere.Good for outside but not for mats for the cheap price, but if you spend something more you get something better for sure."
4,Great shoes,"I use them for taiji (Yang and Wu, 25 years now). They aren't *perfectly* flat... there's often a bit of roll down the center line of the sole. So, if you're beginner, find something perfectly flat -- but if you've learned your form and have begun the decades' long process of improvement, yeah, you want these.They will stick a bit on wooden floors (which is great practice for your balance) but will take some getting used to if you're accustomed to cotton soled kungfu shoes.Mine have been to Shanghai and back a few times now. One of the other reviewers rightly warned that you need to watch your sizing. My foot is somewhere between 12.5 and 13 in American sizing and I needed the 47.Be well.Mp"
3,They are great for slight parkour,"I bought them for parkour, and the grip is very good. But, these are not generally good for a lot of running since they have literally no support. I tried putting a support insole, but since the shoe is too low, and also i got a size bigger the insole pushed my foot out. I got size 44 because im 9.5, but it was a little big. I would have gotten a 43, but they didnt have it in stock. I tied the shoelaces tight and put a thin insole in, and it worked. So I would recommend it for parkour, but with an insole, and dont run or jog too much in these because you WILL DESTROY your ankles. Also, a little hard to get used to since it has a ball shaped outsole. But worth checking out since they are cheap. Be careful about the size though."
4,"Great shoe if you are using them for martial training, terrible walking around shoe","This is a great shoe for its limited purpose, which is for martial arts training. The sole provide good traction on wooden floors and best of all you can feel the floor with your feet. This is an important aspect in all Chinese martial arts training, developing good root and sensitivity in your feet so one can develop power from the feet, through the legs, up the spine and out the hands. Accordingly, they are not constructed to offer support to your feet as additional padding will get in the way of training your legs and the smooth transition of power.Conversely, they are a terrible shoe for anything else. They have no support for walking, hiking or anything else. They don't keep your feet warm and they don't last long if you use them as a daily shoe. They are what they are, a good shoe for indoor martial arts training."
4,Great martial art shoe,"This are a snug fit...they hold up well. They take a minute to break in, mine are still breaking in, as I use them for T'ai Chi Ch'uan and have only used them for 5 or 6 sessions...My main complaint is that they seem to be narrow, or something like that. They throw off my balance because the sole of the shoe seems to teeter really easily...like I'm standing on two vertically elongated poles...haha, if that makes sense. I am hoping I will get used to this, or that when they break in it will go away, otherwise I love these shoes!"
1,Meh!,"Well, I got what I paid for. Cheap price, cheap shoes. The Seller was supportive. The first pair was way too large. I contacted the Seller and he sent a smaller size on a fairly quick turn-around based on the regular shoe info I gave him. The second pair was a closer fit from heel through the arch of the shoe, but still too wide from the ball to the toe. The soles also have a funny feel to them. They have an uneven feel that is kind of diagonal to the shoe when you're standing in them. I was expecting to use these while doing P90X, especially Yoga X. I tried them out and went back to my regular sneakers about 1/3 the way through the routines. When I buy the replacement for these I'll actually go to a store where I can try them on. Lesson learned!"
5,Parkour por que porquoi parker,"These little bad boys are great shoes! I've been doing parkour training for a few years now and have gone through several shoes in disappointment due to the high risks of rolling one's ankle or failure of grip or poor quality of the shoe itself in durability. (All of them expensive)These shoes are not only durable, grippy and flexible...they help with balance, toughening up your feet and flow. You'll have grip where you don't expect to have grip and you'll learn how to land correctly without all that extra padding you'll have in your regular running shoes.My only problem is since I'm learning the European sizes I had ordered a size too snug and so after a good long day of training or work my feet are hurting and a little squished. I'm gonna be ordering a size 45 instead of 44 from now on"
5,So cute!!!,I ordered this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it! She weighs 36 lbs and the 4-6 size scrubs are perfect!!!
3,Aeromax Blue Junior Doctor Scrubs,"It's a costume, it served it's purpose... it's now spread from the front of the house to the back. I will have to say, it was cute as H E double hockey sticks when he put it on Christmas morning. It also comes with a surgical mask, which it doesn't look like on this picture. Also when I was ordering, the picture showed a white dr. jacket in the mix but didn't come with one... and you know how it is with returning items around Christmas.. yea, that never happened.. .so there was a little mix up there. But... the outfit was cute ;o)"
5,Great for a kid who likes to dress up,"My newphew loves to dress up, and now he can pretend he is a doctor. This item goes great with the doctor's playset I got him last year."
3,child's doctor costume,"The costume looks pretty good, but the stethoscope doesn't come with - a little disappointing."
4,"John Henry, Steel Driving Man",This was a good story. It added some life to the charachter that I was trying to portray to my students.
5,John Henry: An American Legend,I purchased this book for my grandson. I had used this book in my classroom and enjoyed sharing it with my grandson. He enjoyed the pictures and the story line about this person.
5,The Genius of Ezra Jack Keats!,Guess which is one of the books I'm using for Black History Month this year?
1,awful awful awful,"About as poor quality of a production as can be found. Also with nothing imaginative shown or suggested. Rather unattractive people used through out, if you going to watch something like this at least let the people be worth watching. It really shows the basic positions anyone can come up with when using a swing, if you have ZERO imagination, then this might help."
5,Must have book for kids of all ages - whether you like baseball or not.,"As an admitted father of two toddlers, book lover, history buff and baseball fan, my review may seem like the most biased you could read. Yes, I do love this book on many levels.But I have shared this book with children and adults of all ages -- many that care less about baseball, sports or history -- and all have been captivated by the illustrations and unbelievable level of detail Christopher Bing brought to this book.Indeed, it is ""copiously and faithfully illustrated"" by the author. Every time you pick up this book you will be rewarded for your attention: it is filled with interesting little images of ads, money and baseball-related items from the period.This book will surprise and delight you, again and again. Nice job, Mr. Bing. Very nice job."
2,Better looks than performance,"You get what you pay for.The salt mill doesn't flake the salt so much as crush it, and the pepper grind is inconsistent. I get a better grind from the cheap plastic grinders on the peppercorn spice bottles you can get at the grocery store. Adjustment is easy using the knob on top, but the results are often poor. The only way to distinguish between the grinders is a cheesy S or P sticker on the top of the knobs (the stickers on mine arrived crooked and peeling).Next time I'll spring for the more expensive Pugeot or other type."
3,Looks better than it works,"The set looks fabulous next to my cooktop, I'll give them that. I'll also give them credit for including a supply of sea salt and peppercorns - a very nice touch.Unfortunately, it takes forever to grind enough pepper -- very little comes out with each crank and there seems to be no way to adjust it. There was no pamphlet included with the set.The salt grinder seems to work just fine, so I may just have just gotten a bum pepper grinder."
4,Where is The Scene..?,"I may be the only person in the Western world that saw the cut of this movie where Gilbert Roland explains to the young killer, Eduardo, the reason that the vendetta is carried on. Don Braulio did, and does, it deliberately, to raise the Zavala family from peonage and give the family purpose. Don Braulio asks Eduardo how he will keep the family motivated when it is his turn to be the head of the family. This is the reason that Eduardo shouts ""Barbarosa"" at the end, when he KNOWS Barbarosa is dead. The scene takes place in the same room where Don Braulio is first informed that ""Barbarosa is dead!"" and before they go out to make the announcement to the assembled family. If anybody saw this scene, it would be great for my mental health to know I am not the only one."
3,OK,"Since I recall nothing about it, good or bad, it must be so-so.Husband and son also don't remember much about it."
4,Great story and characters with crappy soundtrack.,"Like gritty Westerns? You'll love this hidden gem. This is the role Willie Nelson was born to play, even though he never sings. Gary Busey pre-motorcycle accident is a joy to watch. Only sour note is the music score...it's like they just lifted the soundtrack from an old A-TEAM episode, added some trumpets in an attempt to Mexify it, and called it a day. Otherwise, awesome."
5,kris-10,"It's one of the best movies,that Gary Bussey and Willie Nelson ever did. They both are completelyimmersed in their characters"
5,EXCELLENT Western - one of the best ever,"It was hard for me, as a country music hater, to find any interest in Willie Nelson, but in complete contrast to his music, I think he makes a fantastic character in a western. He can actually act and act very well, portraying a crusty outlaw who serves as the unwilling mentor of a goofy country boy, played by Gary Busey. This movie develops the classic master-apprentice theme and crafts a very exciting, well thought story. This is every bit as good as The Magnificent Seven or The Outlaw Josey Wales. Buy it, you won't regret it."
2,Terrific little-seen western on an awful DVD,"Fred Schepisi's ""Barbarosa"" was all but buried on its initial release in 1982, and has seldom been seen since. That's too bad, because William D. Wittliff's literate, poetic script shows genuine feeling for -- and an insider's knowledge of -- the American West. With memorable performances from Willie Nelson and Gary Busey, ""Barbarosa"" is worth seeing. Unfortunately, the full-frame video transfer here is awful. Given the poor quality of this DVD, the price comes as something of an insult."
4,"Barbarosa, a different look at the old west.","I've always loved the movie, since first seeing it on Cinemax in the early 80's. I was happy with the DVD quality."
2,Bad Barbarosa,"The movie was badly directed, full of cursing, and sorry acting on Willie Nelson's part."
4,On its Own,"Faded Edge has a certain sound that is hard to fit into a specific category. They are a little bit of many styles, all of which have heavy edges. From Eric's Jazzy solos on Rose to John's screaming his heart out on Subversion of Christianity, things get pretty diverse and intense on the album. This band is definately very creative and very appealing to a wide variety of audiences. Buy the album."
5,"I hate online games but I love the ''Fake"" ones",I don't like dealing with people online in games but this game is soo fun to me I love most anything jrpg as long as it has a cute factor and some kind of multiple choice options.It's also kinda nostalgia because I played the first one when it came out and now i'm 21 and I always feel like i'm back in the moment.
5,Great Game; Great Seller,"For those interested in buying this game, I would sugest that you get the first two installments, Infection, and Mutation first cause if u start here, u will die alot in the game. Also, I suggest to being a .hack//sign as well. Otherwise the game is great the story is getting deeper and I am so close to the end.This seller was fast and i would recomend him to anyone."
2,gravely disappointing,"Drawbacks-the graphics and gameplay are idenical to the first 2 games.I have become so sick of the same dungeons, and fields...I can't count how many times I've been into a blue dungeon idenical to the very first one in part 1 (infection)-The storyline has gone from intriguing, to bizzare and confusing.-the one and only new city looks ALOT like the 2nd city in .hack//infection (dun loriage), and it's very tiresome to shop there due to the fact the shops are very far apart and the graphics just repeat.- the game itself is incredibly short.- the DVD was also bizzare, and the story line (if there is one) was just a bunch of random events, and people talking about the epitath of twilight.The Good- the new characters are more colorful than the last.I was a huge .hack fan..now I feel jipped.I'm definately never buying from Bandai again..rent it...you'll have no time completing it several times over in 4 days."
4,Wow...,"This is an amazing game!As a big fan of the anime genre, I saw an ad for . Hack in a magazine and decided to buy it . It was AMAZING!!!The graphics , the story , the gameplay! It was allwonderful!And the best part is I've never played a . Hack game.Althout I recommend you do your homework and check the internetto catch up with the story.Bottom line :Better than Halo!!!!"
1,average rating --- 2 stars,"4 short games, 50 dollars each. Now, 2 games would have been fine. 4 games is a joke. The creators are obviously trying to mooch all the money they can. The first game got repetitive. They have taken it to a whole new level.You still do the exact same things. If you find a great sword you can't use it, but you can give it to the person who wants it. If you get to the bottom theres a boss and a cutscene. Later you go into another dungeon that looks EXACTLY the same as the last one.The game fails to prove it's own worth. Now, if they only made 2 long games, as I have said, that would have been fine. Get a new engine guys, or a new concept. It doesn't work 4 times in a row."
5,Holy cow,This is so far the best of the four part saga. Now I won't soile it by telling to much but if you ever saw how the first boss in Dot Hack//Sign. The one chasing Aura. That is a key in this game. I really think hat people will love this game. You really do need to be at least level 53 to start. Five stars
1,This light is so bad that,"you think it's the batteries, but it's not, it's the flashlight! I've knocked myself out putting new batteries in but this flashlight is garbage. Please buy something else and save your money!"
3,Good Music,Heatwave did a great job with bringing you some of their greatest hits. I just wish they would have included Groove Line. Just not the same without Johnny Wilder.
1,Disappointing,I love old horror movies and I love cheap campy movies but this collection is just bad.The Devil's hand has some nice cinematography and is the best in the set. Seems like there is an awful lot of saving Hitler's brain in these movies.
3,Very Interesting,This a very interesting account of a woman who has AD/HD. She discusses her struggles and her journey through life with AD/HD. She tells about the different options that she has taken to help manage her AD/HD and what worked for her.This book is more of an autobigraphy than a self help AD/HD book.
5,Can wild things be free?,"Widow Rachel, struggling to raise her two kids alone, needs a hired hand for her landscaping business. Quinn, just out of prison, needs a job. Quinn likes her wildness and enjoy discomfiting Rachel, who enjoys Quinn's presence a little too much.This story would be almost cliche -- the general plot of lots of serial romances -- if it weren't for how Quinn's wildness is the very reason she is vulnerable to Rachel -- and Rachel's kids. It's Quinn, not Rachel, who is thrown for a loop by feelings she has for Rachel. Rachel, too, is an interesting character. This was my first Lyn Denison book and I'll be looking for more."
3,Not bad..too short,"This novel wasn't bad. The plot was realistic and ""normal-ish"". It was too short though. It read like a long short story. I think the large font helped to stretch it to novel size but it's still a book you can read in a few hours.I would have liked to know more of what was going on in Rachel's head. Also would have liked for the scenes not to either be at the landscaping business or the house. Or Rachel's thoughts to be either on the landscaping business or happenings at home. I think the author could have added some dimensions to the characters without losing where the focus was to be.I would read another novel by this author. I'd hope that the next one would be longer and with characters not so confined in either this thought arena or that one OR this scenery or that one."
5,Eclectic Afternotes From A Great Movie,"This soundtrack is an interesting mix of different styles and eras of music. This soundtrack does an effective job in conveying the different scenes and moods of the movie ""Donnie Brasco"". I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoyed the movie enough to watch it more than once. Each song brings back a specific scene from the movie. Listening to the soundtrack and remembering the scenes from the movie is a delight!"
2,a little outdated,"I'm learning how to airbrush but this book is about 20 years old and technology has changed since then. It still has all the basic stuff like masking clouds with rubber cement and cotton, but ask for rubber cement anywhere, and they think you want to buy it to huff it! I guess nobody uses it anymore. But looking for a newer book is difficult and I did learn a little from this book."
5,Great philosophy book and perfect for a christian teaching,This book combines philosophy and christianity perfectly. I higly reccommend it as a teaching tool or enjoyment reading.
5,Great time saver!,"An amazingly-simple device that works exactly as advertised. Peeling garlic used to be a tedious, time consuming task that often resulted in crushed cloves. This thing quickly removes the garlic husk with minimal effort and time. A few quick rolls of the devise is all it takes. Highly recommended."
5,You absolutely need this if you cook with garlic,"I hate peeling garlic so much I used to buy those tubs of pre-peeled cloves. But I like to buy organic garlic, which doesn't come pre-peeled. I hate peeling garlic with a passion so I'm not sure why I waited so long to get one of these gadgets. It's great. Peels garlic without getting your fingers stinky. The only thing is, it doesn't work so well with flat cloves - works best on fat, round cloves. BTW, if you suffer from stinky garlic fingers like I do, rub your fingers on a stainless steel spoon and it'll remove all traces of garlic stink."
3,Garlic peeler,Garlic peeler was not as long as the one I already had. I did not like the material used as well as the one I currently own. The cylinder was also smaller. I kept it only because I didn't want the inconvenience of returning it
3,Does not work as advertised,"I bought this on the advice of the positive reviews. I have not found it works well. No matter how hard I press down, only some if any of the shell comes off. But it does take some of the shell off but I still think It's a waste of money, I have read boiling the cloves for one minute works. I have not yet tried this method."
5,KISS,"It works, it's simple, it cleans up easily. Solves the smelly fingers. Will be a great stocking stuffer at Christmas this year."
5,garlic peeler,"I have searched for years for an easy way to peel garlic and have finally found it. This is the best and fastest way to peel it! My daughter-in-law had one and once I used it, I was hooked! I bought several and gave as stocking stuffers this Christmas."
3,Yawn,"Often Vox hits home runs, even with sub-par engineering. Here the engineering is fine. The notes are all there. But it's not engaging Mozart at all. I don't know what to recommend in place of this boring peformance. Hopefully it's not Mozart's inspiration, but maybe it is thin here. At least, after listening to these discs, that's my impression. 3 stars for engineering and technical proficiency, then."
5,AWESOME!,"The entire series rocked. Of course, I could've died when I found out that Chris Sabat dubbed for Ayame Sohma(the pain), but overall the dvd was great!!Oh yeah, in the Extras menu, type in 10 with your DVD remote for a surprise!!"
3,"excellent story, terrible sound quality","I am debating returning the DVD and trying to get an exchange, as the sound quality of the copy I bought is horrible .... volume has to be cranked all the way up to hear it and you get an electronic 'buzz' throughout the whole DVD.The story lines and character interactions are wonderful, though, true to the quality of the series. However the fact that the stories and characters are so delightful makes the awful sound quality even more disappointing."
5,"7"" 2 Tine Granny Fork","Bought this because I had an OLD one of Granny's and needed a new one. It is smaller and I find that I really have comlpete control of the fork because of its size. Have RA and this is a plus. The quality is top of the line. I use it daily and don't know how I got along with out it. Emily Michael, Va."
1,Lynn Hahn: Get Real Fit: Basic Strength Training,"I was a bit disappointed in this one but I should have been warned by the title. This is a Very basic beginner's introduction to weights. I did it once and frankly am looking to trade it for something a bit more advanced. As a regular Firm/Cathe user I should have known better than to get anything with the name ""Basic"" in it. On the positive side, Lynn is a very comprehensive instructor, caring and concerned that you get all you can from the exercises. She is perfect in this dvd for someone who is truly new to weights, and uses excellent form in her demonstrations."
3,Great Sandals,The sandal arrived pretty soon and I love them. Except that the leather is a little hard and I got blisters on my 4th toe. So I am hoping that I will break into them and then they will be comfortable enough to wear everyday.
2,"Pretty shoes, they just don't stay on","I am returning my shoes. Although they are attractive to look at, they don't stay on my feet. The section of the shoe that creates the ""slide"" is too small and too low on the foot so the shoe slips off with every other step or so. If the slide came up higher on the foot or was just a little larger, they would be fine. I have another pair of slides just like this so I know it isn't the style of the shoe; the problem is with this specific design."
5,Never leave home without it,With my sensitive skin and my daughters eczema we tried the Dr Bronner products. It's been years now and we won't use anything else on our skin.
5,Great Price,We all know that Dr. Bonners soaps are wonderful. What was really great here was an exceptionally low price.
4,Nice but a little dry,"I usually get the peppermint kind, this dries my skin out a little more but the scent is nice. I loved that the vitamin shop had low price & shipping, it made it worthwhile finally to buy it online."
3,Great scent!,This soap has a fragrance that is very nice but I found that it is not thick enough for the soap pump.
2,Low Price....Low quality,"This is not the way Ravel is supposed to be played. It sounds heavy-handed, and too Romantic for my taste. The texture variances and image-making techniques are not there. Also the sound quality is poor. If you just want to know what Ravel's piano music sounds like, then buy it for reference. But if you want to experience the music, I reccomend Martha Argerich."
1,This doesn't even sound like Ravel,Dear Mr Simon: Please take some lessons on Ravel's piano music before tackling it. This is not Chopin. Take your foot of the pedal once in a while. This is outrageously bad.
5,Different but Wonderful,"Many years ago I made a disparaging remark in my $ensible Sound magazine column about the original LP release; what an idiot I was! My remark had to do with the liberal use of pedals by Mr. Simon, which seemed to distort the music. Listening now, I find his approach different, but quite wonderful. Maybe I am getting soft in my old age, but so be it. By any measure, this is a wonderful performance.This delightful set is now available in a two-CD set that is even more delightful than it is inexpensive, making it one heck of a bargain. If you are new to classical music and have not yet experienced the magical piano music of Ravel, please do not hesitate to take the plunge. You will be glad you did. This music is magic!"
5,A Hidden Treasure,"I'm a musican with a band called tenpenny opera. I first ran into this album on a website called cdbaby which let me listen to a few tracks. I sometimes shop for emerging artists on this site who may or may not have record deals to date. I had never heard of Jennifer Terran but I loved her music immediately. For me, it's like someone uncovered a Joni Mitchell basement tape that was recorded somewhere along the ""Blue"" era and inexplicably lost to the world for 30 years. Do yourself a favor and buy the album. You won't regret it."
5,Qualtiy & Easy To Use,I have this on a Streamlight TL-3 flashlight. It is black in color and comes with the ends to attach the pressure switch to a grip or handle or another type of device. Works well and is definitely Streamlight quality. Check around for better prices. Be Safe!
2,Very weak book,"I have more than 10 years experience in microwaves, and the book's really disappointed me. The book appears to be just a compilation of the journal articles earlier published by the author. As a result, the book lacks integrity, and many parts have been unnecessary duplicated in most chapters.The book doesn't provide any serious theoretical background that would support and help to interpret most experimental results. Since most experiments described in the book have been performed on very specific samples, the book would be of some interest for a limited audience only. Apparently, the change in the title to reflect the more applied character of the book would lower readers' expectations."
4,animejunky,"The beginning of the Piccolo era. After losing to Tein in the World Martial Arts Tournament Goku finds krillin dead, and so it begins. This first volume in the two volume set ends with the monumental death of Master Roshi. A very good buy for the price and a must have for a fan. If you never seen the show before, this is a good place to start. All you fans out there better buy now the price will probably go up as avalibility is going down, like the whole Piccolo Jr. Saga."
5,"""I bought both books""","It is really importatant to stick to the opening system with your bank role! I went to Reno the weekend of 5/19/06 and bought both of Collin Pratts books 5 months in advance of my trip...I won the first 2 days...where I lost money was going on my own and not sticking to the system (I got alittle greedy). My husband won more than I did by remembering the things I told him to do in the months of reading to him! You dont need to go hog wild like the Casinos want you to...you just need to know how to be alittle ""patient""...The author use to work in a casino...and it's obvious once you are there actually playing the game."
1,Virtually unreadable,"I paid for the Kindle edition to brush up on Crassus. The section on him alone is almost unreadable as spelling mistakes abound. Crassus is often spelled as Orassus and Ckassus not just once or twice, but literally throughout. The order of mistakes is random yet regular. This leads me to believe the contents of a printed book were scanned and uploaded to a program that takes lifts characters off an image, in which certain characters were not properly electronically transmitted. Rivalry is spelled Eivalry, Rome is spelled Eome (Romans become Eomans), Gaius is Oaius. This is a real shame, as this is a good, concise work that deserves better than this. Too laborious to get through, and a waste of $3 (we're not all as well-to-do as Crassus!)."
4,Wonderful!!!!!,I love this dvd. It is a must for beginner beaders. This dvd has me making a lot of bracelets and necklaces!!!!
4,Good end to the first series.,This is the final game in the first four .hack games. I wont spoil anything so ill simply say it has a good ending to the story and while it is generally more of the same if you like the other games in the series you will like this one.
2,Nothing new and SHORT!,"Nothing new here from the other games. It was very very short and left a rather empty ending. This game didn't even bother to have all your characters request your help in a dungeon which I enjoyed in the other games. You are pretty much stuck with Black rose in this game and I liked other characters much better. One good point about this game is once you have SAVED ""The World"" you do get to continue to play and get item completion with some side dungeon quests added in. The problem is I kind of lost interest as I was no longer playing to complete a story but just for fun. After 4 games of the same fighting, this doesn't add much interest to me."
3,I got this to complete a collection of VGs...,"I am an hour into the first game. so to give any ratings for the last one is ridiculous. I'm giving it a generic 3 because the dang listings demand input. good luck in finding another copy to buy since amazingly enough, this last one was a B!tch to locate."
1,"1 star for price, not game","I give this one star for its price, not the game itself. Here, as on auction sites, this game is described as ""rare"". How rare can it really be when there's at least 10 available at any given time, often complete with the animé DVD? I would like to have this game to complete my collection, but I absolutely will not pay $70+ for it. When the price comes down to a more reasonable level, like around $25, I'll consider it then, but not now."
1,The exact same as the other games.,"This is the exact same game as the other games. There's a few new items, but nothing to celebrate. Sure it's a conclusion, but you just spent 200 bucks on 4 games that are all 12 hours(maximum) long. Way to go!"
4,Excellent Voice and Content,"Christopher Love has one of the best voices I've ever heard and could have easily been a voice-over artist had he chosen that road. This is basically the same as two other CD's of his that I own. He uses the same wording to take you to a deep meditational state, but changes the content once you've reached that state. Of the 3 CDs of his that I own, the music on his Weight Loss CD is the best. I listen to it almost every night, as much for its spiritual message and the relaxation benefits from his soothing words, music and voice as its healthful eating message."
5,My entire family's favorite,"This has always been the favorite sauce of my family and my brother's family. We have made it since the 70's (always on a friday nite when my parents went out to dinner) The first time my brother and I made it we didnt follow the directions and dumped the cheese packet in with the sauce mix. We still make it that way to this day, the cheese thickens the sauce a little, its even better if thats possible!"
1,Cant believe 4.5 stars!,"Oh my god. I expected so much more from a food with 4.5 stars.This tastes worse than the cheapest spaghetti at a cafeteria. Like canned food.I couldn't even eat half a bowl, let alone a whole box!"
2,Maybe a bad batch,We're on our 4th case from Amazon. This latest one really isn't very good. I've cooked about 4-5 boxes trying to cook the pasta right. The spaghetti noodles just keep getting skinnier and skinnier until they are like angel hair.Will probably just end up taking the seasoning/parmesan packets out and pitch the pasta.Two stars for the seasoning and -3 for the crappy pasta.
4,Still using it...,We made this spaghetti for our kids and our daughter still uses it for her family. We really like the flavor of the sauce.
3,The Tanginess is Gone!,"I ate Kraft Italian Spaghetti many, many times when was growing up in the '60s, and continued to enjoy it for many years until sometime in the '80s, where it started to disappear from the supermarket shelves. I bought it because I just loved the tangy sauce; the noodles were never anything special. I was pleased to find out that it was available from Amazon, and bought 36 boxes. However, now that I have tried several boxes, I have to say that the taste is not the same. I've made the sauce alternating with tomato sauce and tomato paste, and the sauce is just too sweet. If anyone has an idea of what I can do to get the original ""tang"" back, I would greatly appreciate it."
5,TASTIEST TANGY SKETTI AVAILABLE,"Tastes same as it did 40 years ago, secret is seasoning packet, we don't add butter to make it even tangier & low cal. Parmesan packet is a joke, a tablespoon, we sprinkle on our own cup or two."
5,Best spicy spaghetti sauce!,I used to purchase this at local grocery stores but all stores in our area have dropped this item. It is our very favorite sauce!
5,"Kraft Noodle Classics, Tangy Italian Spaghetti Dinner, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24","Kraft Noodle Classics, Tangy Italian Spaghetti Dinner, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24 I donated the case to the food bank. I have used this product for years and really like it so much."
2,A Different Take on a Classic,"As someone who did not grow up eating this stuff, I admit that a lot of its praise is lost on my family. It really is quite a different beast than what most people would consider Spaghetti. It tastes more like a pungent herbal version that is as to spaghetti what a veggie burger is to a hamburger. In a similar fashion, opinions are going to vary widely and I've found that many people recoil a bit because they simply weren't expecting it to taste so different. That doesn't make it bad, by any means, but I would suggest that you don't start with a whole case. Personally, I find a simple dinner made with store brand sauce and noodles vastly preferable."
3,Meh,"Don't get me wrong, it's good, I just prefer my homemade spaghetti. It's messy as all get out to make, but, totally worth it. Any homemade is, really...I just love homemade spaghetti, sue me.But I realize, not everyone knows how to cook, or has the time, or just doesn't feel like it (& doesn't have an Italian mama around ;). In those cases, you should totally buy this. It's definitely good for those spaghetti-craving nights I seem to have far too frequently."
1,good,"The product is great, but I do not understand why you charged me postage this time and you have not done so in the past!"
5,Yummy treats,Both of my dogs love these treats. I am so glad I can give them something good for them that they beg to have! And no worries about what might have been put in them from another country.
5,"After 4 MTEL failures, I bought this and passed!","This book is an absolute lifesaver. If you have taken and FAILED the MTEL Foundations of Reading, buy this book and pass it once and for all. The book breaks things down that I hadn't understood in the past. I took the test 4 times and failed each time (once by 1 point, and various other scores following that). The point is, this book combined with review questions from the MTEL website gave me the necessary information to pass this test. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
4,Excellent resource!,"This was the only study aid I used to prepare for the MTEL Foundations of Reading. I was very nervous about taking it because I had yet to take the ELA course at my university and I had heard from several people how difficult the test was. Infact, I knew many people who did not pass the first time, and some did not pass the second time. I studied this book very carefully and then took the MTEL website sample exam. I did very well the first time through and found that the book followed the model very closely that was reflected on the MTEL. I continued to review the content chapter right up until the test. I am glad to say that I passed the first time I took the Foundations of Reading MTEL and I don't think I would have been able to accomplish that without this book. Reasonably priced and very easy to follow!"
5,I passed MTEL Foundations of Reading on my 1st attempt!!,This book was my one & only source of study for the MTEL F.O.R test. I had heard nothing but horror stories from people who had taken this exam. I have been out of college for 18 years and therfore out of practice taking exams. I used this for the F.O.R and not only passed but did very well. I also bought MTEL (the yellow & black book) for the Communications & Literacy and passed with flying colors. Good Luck!!
2,A Guide To SQL,Sketchy at best. Gives some good examples but does not cover all of the SQL language. Jumps around a lot. Definitely not worth the 30+ dollars.
1,Database concepts given are very confusing.,"The book ""jumps"" around a lot. Many concepts of the Database are not clear or confusing.I take a Database design class which requires this book, but I absolutely don't recommend it to anyone looking to get some knowledge in SQL."
4,A good read..,"Another good romance book about love, trust and the battles of a past childhood. Please read and support this author"
5,Love this book,This was a really good book. I think the characters are well written and very likeable. I always want more though I would have loved to read about their wedding and wedding night. I would have also like to have read about the house fully restored.
3,Good quick read,It was a good story with a sexy storyline. The story was a little trite but there were some twists that I wasn't expecting.
4,Loved the characters,I enjoyed the rich characters. Lovely description of the locations and pretty funny at times. I'm glad I read this book.
3,Could have had more,I felt like this kinda of drags on and I kept waiting for the climax but it just never came. It is a quick read and I got it for free. So for a free book it was okay
4,Good,good read. I really enjoyed this book. I look forward to reading more by carol rose. She writes a wonderful tale.
1,ALWAYS,From the description it sounded good but I found it dry & boring. My kindle copy had a lot of errors that also made the story hard to follow.
4,Always,This book was nice I liked it it brought tears to my eyes but at the end it made Me smile two thumbs up
3,Awesome,It was good. I love the stories of the guy chasing the girls. All though some of the spelling is messed up.
2,Just OK..,"I THINK IT ENDED ABRUPTLY. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO SEE AN EPILOGUE, to see them a few years later in the renovated house with kids."
2,Just....blah,"I should know better than to get excited about reading a book because it's free and there is a beautiful man on the cover. This book was really just not up my alley. It was written like a historical novel, I think it would've been a little better if it was. All the talk about plantations, hoop shirts, petticoats...made it seem very old fashioned. My biggest problem with the book was that numerous times I had to check and make sure I didn't just skip a page (or more) by accident, the flow of the story was just weird and did not make sense whatsoever sometimes. The chapters didn't seem to be broken up correctly. El was whiney and so untrusting of Cole and I knew what the ""big problem"" would be at the end of this book, it was no surprise that for sure. Big disappointment, I will delete it for sure, I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I have read worse, but so SO many better as well."
4,A good read,I really enjoyed reading this book. The story was good and the characters were well thought out. Definately read this one.
4,Attention getter...,Good story to read. Would have loved a little longer version. What a read.More please. What's next for us?
5,Perfection,"This story held the desire to follow your heart even when it might not be the be s choice. I loved this booked because it wasn't all perfect from the beginning, it described what love really is. So thank you, I've enjoyed reading this oh so greatly."
4,GOOD FREE READ,"This was a good read given the fact that it was free!!! It is short and romantic, everything I was looking for"
5,Excellent!,Very good book! Would highly recommend to anyone interested in a nice romance with a little passion added to peak your interest
3,A good book,This was a good book but some edits need to be made. I plan to tell my friends if their looking for a good read they should pick up this book.
3,Where's the sex,This book was a well written book that was way too short with no (sex) action. There are a few scenes that just leave you wanting more. All in all I liked the book and will probably look at other books by this author.
2,Sllloooowww!,"If you like a very slow paced story, with way too many missed opportunites, this could be your book.I like a faster pace--had to wait to 78%of Kindle pages for any action between the two."
3,it was ok,"I thought this was an okay read. It had a few grammar errors that were annoying, but the plot and set up of the story was good. Have to say that it is free so you guys should try it and have an ok read."
5,Loved it!!!!!,"Was a quick read, the author kept you wanting more....must say that I loved the characters and was completely happy with the ending!"
2,predictable plot,The story gets 3 stars...cute but very predictable....and loses another star for really bad editing. It is full of typos..things like a 5 where an s should be.
4,"not the best, but not the worst","This was an ok book. Very predictable, but had some humorous parts to it too. Wouldn't pay for it by any means but since it was free, it wast too bad. Unfortunately I have paid for worse"
3,Ok reading,"A little slow in places, but the ending was too rushed. Nice storyMore romance would have made it better"
2,Always,"The story line was good, but this is just not the kind of book that I enjoy. Teenagers would probably enjoy it."
3,Good read,"A lot of errors in my kindle book, making it a bit distracting for me. The Story line was fabulous. Love the spontaneous dates Elinor received. A great story concept. Would recommend it to all."
3,Look out for all the hyphens!,"This story was about average for a romance. I enjoyed the story even though it was very predictable and the believability of the crisis was a bit strained. The only really negative thing I have to say is there were hyphens splitting up words that shouldn't have been divided on practically every page and they interrupted the flow of the story. There were also several places that I had to stop and figure out what word was really supposed to be there to make sense. However, I don't believe that reading it was a waste of time and if you're in the mood for an easy, pleasant read, you could do a lot worse than this one."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This book looked promising. First of all, it was free (which is always a good thing). I am a southerner, so I always love books that take place in the South. What I didn't like about this book was Elinor's character. I mean..what on earth did Cole see in her? Other than the fact that she was a ""challenge,"" I just don't understand why he would want her. She was mean, and clearly not interested in him. He was rich, gorgeous, and could do way way better than Elinor (in my opinion). So...all that being said...just don't waste your time unless you want to be really frustrated with a bi-polar woman who doesn't deserve the man pining away for her."
3,Decent Read,"This was another short story and could have been stronger with a bit more development. It really needs a pass with the editor, but if I'm engrossed in a story I don't care that much about it. I pretty much liked the characters. It wasn't all believable but then what romance is. I'm not looking for reality, I'm looking to escape. I liked the story and felt it was worth the price. I will try another book by this author. Also, loved the cover."
4,Good Read...,"The characters were fairly believable and easy to like, although the heroine (Elinor) seemed a little too quick to judge Cole. The plot was relatively predictable, but it was still a fun and relaxing read."
4,Funny and engaging,"I agree with The Book Runner. There were a lot of hyphens in this book, but I don't think it really detracted from the story all that much. I enjoyed reading the banter between the two very well-developed characters. I think the hyphens could have been from scanning the book into a word recognition program. I noticed it came in paperback as well. I think that's a silly and tedious way to make a kindle book. Why not just convert the original manuscript? Oh well, it was an enjoyable book overall, with a happy ending, which is what I like most about romance novels."
4,great quick read,"typical contemporary romance, good story line, good character developmental, made you relate to the characters and feel their same emotions"
5,Great book,It was a really good read a stubborn women who falls in love with a man who is rich and powerful the last man she would imagine herself falling in love with! Has a juicy love seen and teases u a little along the way .
4,Good quick read,Cute book with that keeps you wanting to read more. Easy and fun weekend read for those who like romance books.
5,I loved it!!!!,If you want a good romance story scholar this one! I fell in love with Cole the moment his name was mentioned!
5,Always,"Elinor and Cole can you say stubborn and misunderstanding? Great story of how this two people work through their issues to work towards each other. Will it work? Will the industrialist get his lad and construction, will Elinor keep the land???"
3,Ok,It was just ok. The ending wasn't anything spectacular. Thread have been to the ending in my opinion. However it wasn't bad.
5,great book,"Good,funny,sweet ,love books like these will read more by this author. Like to see when they fall in Love. Great"
5,Always follow your heart,Makes me wish all men were like Cole. Rich and loving and sensitive. Being great iron bed helps too! Steamy!!
4,Always,I enjoy reading this book. Carol rose did a great job on explaining how money can't buy everything. I will shear this book with my sister and friends
2,How Can You Slam A Freebie?,"If I had paid for this book I would have given it 1 star. It's cute, I guess I've moved passed cute books. It's quaint...it's a romance with almost no intimacy...there's no character development but hey it was free...I most likely will delete from my kindle and make a note to not read another book by this author. Times have changed, romance fiction novels have changed...this author is stuck in the 1970's. Don't waste space on your kindle or lose precious time reading this book."
3,Not to bad,This wasn't to bad. The story was an easy read. The characters were likable. But somewhere along the way I felt like I was struggling with the story. Im not sure what the problem was. I always enjoy stories where the hero thinks he can have it all until he realizes to late that you cant. Thats what happened here. Even with Cole's lies I still enjoyed him. He was so full of himself it was kinda funny. Overall this was a good read.
5,rocky and bulllwinkle 3d season,This is an excellent collection with very good quality reproduction and sound. Well worth it for the true fan and the novice as well.
4,Something to think about,"I would have given this 5 stars but for a few nagging doubts I have:1. As most shows of this era and indeed up to the eighties run to about 25 mins, why do these run 22.5 mins?2. Even though the booklet in the first volume describes the opening titles as creator Jay Ward's favourite version, no other show I know of has a TM sign on the actual titles. And why are sections watermarked with an ""R&B;"" symbol?3. The end credits are dated 1997, so are these shortened syndicated versions?4. Why not include alternate opening/closing titles in the extras. Aren't we all longing to see the flashing sign and popping bulb closing we remember so dearly?UPDATE: As one of the extras was a ""sneak Peek"" at the fourth season, WHAT HAPPENED?. We've been waiting patiently. Is it ever going to appear?"
2,Idiotic design flaw,"This is a great idea, but this particular item has a design flaw. The first three days I used this, it worked perfectly. On the fourth day, it uploaded only 30% of the steps I had logged that day. When I contacted tech support, they informed me that ""sort of external interference that caused it to reset and loose data"". They listed many possible causes: airport x-rays, cellular phones, wireless routers, speakers, and -yes!- treadmills. Be aware that this device may not work around computers and treadmills because it was designed without shielding. This seems a foolish thing to overlook in a device meant to measure walking and then be connected to a computer to upload data. Buyer beware."
3,SportBrain pedometer not very smart,"I was required by my fitness program on eDiets to buy this pedometer, although I had a perfectly good Omron HJ-112. The method of setting weight, stride and time variables is not at all intuitive and requires taking off the battery cover. The strap clip does not look like it will hold up well. The stride and weight variables only increment in even numbers -- beware if your stride is, say 27"" or your weight 137. It seems like an awful lot of money to keep track of your progress, which you could do fairly easily with a spreadsheet -- or paper and pencil. I definitely would not have bought it if I hadn't been required to. *UPDATE: I finally threw this one away. It didn't count approximately 40-70% of the steps I took in a day, and, conversely, shifting in my seat at work would add steps. Use the money to buy something good, that works. I couldn't change the number of stars I gave this, but it would have been one star or less. A true waste of money at any price."
2,"Good products, bad company support","I purchased the similar iStep X2 around a year and a half ago. It worked great, as described by other reviewers, with a fairly accurate step count, good upload capability, and many more features than I ever needed.However, the initial unit died within the first 6 months, and the warranty replacement died at about one and a half years. At this point SportBrain is saying since it only has a 1 year limited warranty they won't repair it, replace it, nor sell me a refurbished unit at a discount.If you are happy with having to replace it every year or two its a good product, but I expect a bit more longevity out of my purchases."
5,Blessings In Christ,This book was a real blessing to me. I learned a lot. I learned the Authority that comes with Christ and how to accept the blessings the Lord has given me. Its one thing to walk with Christ and another to know what blessing he gives you daily and how to receive them. Blessings In Christ helped remind me that the Lord blesses me everyday and to walk strong in the Lord.
3,sander,I have always bought DeWalt sanders. This wasn't as good. The hook and loop backer is already tearing off and the dust catcher falls off easily.
4,Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,"It's amazes me to read people in this (and other reviews) lament Judy Garland's ""version"" of 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas."" Her version is the definitive and original version from the classic film ""Meet Me in St. Louis."" The POINT of the song is sad and is about being separated from loved ones during the Christmas season. It is yes, about trying to ""muddle through somehow."" If that offends your sunny sensibilities, then you might not like this version. But sometimes Christmas is merry, sometimes not. Just like life. Other artists wanting to put a more positive spin on the song- changed the lyrics. I love her ""version."" I think it is poignant and moving. Great album overall."
5,wonderfully evocative music...,"Rachel Portman's beautiful, sweeping score aids dramatically to the storytelling. It won an academy award, and it's not hard to see why! Each track chronicles a 'chapter' in the film, providing just the right sounds to accompany the action onscreen. Even if you haven't seen the film, you'll love it!"
5,Exquisite.,"Rachel Portman's Oscar-winning score is a wonderful listening experience - a lovely theme woven throughout a suite of musical settings, with nothing jarring to disrupt the delightful mood it will put you in. Perfect with a good book and a cup of tea. Cheers!"
5,Butter-Yellow Mischief for your Tea and Scones,"Although I've qualms with the movie's distributor, I cannot deny that the soundtrack for ""Emma"" is one of the most charming, delightful, mischievous, bright, skipping, tripping, happy CD's out there. From the windblown main theme, to the plucked strings of Emma's many schemes, to the Christmas carriage ride, to Regency Dance music (sans Sir Beveridge's Maggot - alas!), Ms. Portman has done an excellent job capturing the spirit of Jane Austen's classic novel. An excellent addition to anyone's musical library, a must for lovers of soundtracks - Austen ones in particular, and a great CD for both the office and the arbor."
4,Love it!,"This is a great cd, and I can't stop listening to it. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the cd does not include Gwyneth Paltrow's lovely rendition of ""Have You Not Seen My Lady?"" Even without this wonderful song, the cd is really worth it."
5,dbz-kid buu-a new beginning,gread dvd. satisfying ending. had to purchase this disc solo. can't wait for the box set. dbz great series from beginning to end. a must for all dbz fans.
5,"Great Ella, Swing!","The previous review was correct in all, but in this: Ella's CD entitled ""The Intimate Ella"" is the re-recording of the soundtrack of ""Let No Man Write My Epitaph"", and not Pete Kelly's Blues.Ella sang Pete Kelly's Blues for the the soundtrack of the same movie, in which Miss Peggy Lee also starred, and that was out in 1955, while Ella was under contract for Decca Records.Anyway, I think this is one album that has been taken for granted and underestimated. It's a great swinging and soft CD. I love each song, both the ballads (listen to Memories Of You...it's a masterpiece!) and the swinging songs (you won't help but fingersnapping listening to Hello Dolly!).I remember to all that 2006 will be the decennal of Ella's death, and in 2007 Ella would have been 90...so we hope Verve records will continue in this way, issuing a deluxe version of Ella In Hollywood, with many of the hundreds songs that were recorded in more than a week of concerts!!!!!!!!"
3,hair is nicer than woman,"i waited 2 years to finally purchase this cd. thought it was overpriced. i was right. and on top of that, the music is worse that i thought. stop comparing her to joni mitchell. she is not even close. joni is joni, and will never be bettered at what she does. ripping your heart out, and letting you hold it. as you hold it you can now fix it, and make all thing in your life either better, or alot worse. jennifer will have to suffer much more to come out with a really honest cd. i will say one good thing about her, she is very soft on the eyes."
4,Mr. Goldsmith Goes To Africa,"It's interesting how Jerry Goldsmith blends African, Irish, and traditional orchestral music into only one score. That's one of the reasons why I enjoy ""The Ghost And The Darkness"". His main title is very catchy; it's like listening to the theme from ""Medicine Man"", but with African rhythms, and its bridge performed on French horns is fantastic. There are good moments of suspense and action, especially with 'Lions Attack', 'Starling's Death', and 'Final Attack'. There are also tender moments that not only showcases the African landscapes, but also the longing of Val Kilmer's character for his family, as in 'The Bridge', 'Catch A Train', and 'Welcome To Tsavo'. Jerry Goldsmith's score is complemented by exotic African chants by The Worldbeaters."
4,Mr Goldsmith adds another good work...,"Jerry Goldsmith in my mind has some great works to date, this work is another trophy in his trophy case. He mixes together music of English and African themes and you have a score which is very satisfying."
3,Not as triumphant as I would have thought.,"I remembered the music from the movie being a fine balance of mystical, sinister and triumphant. The first two descriptors are caught magnificantly on this CD. As a whole, though, the CD didn't capture me the way I thought it would. I'm not sure I would buy it again."
5,revealing,"This book opened my eyes to some of my own problems. The old saying that we are our own worst enemy is true and this book reveals how this can happen to us. The core of it is our self-centeredness. As children we find that people revolve around our needs, but often people do not grow out of that. A God centered person has their mind on God, a self-centered person has their mind on self. Satan is at the core of self and C.S. Lovett unravels this truth beautifully. I highly recommend this book!"
4,"Great, and Complete Book. But the DW plugs get old.","This book covers a lot of things you won't find in other drum books (Eg. head selection, overview of major drum brands, etc) and is a very useful resource for any drummer. The biggest problem is Mr. Miller's over-the-top plugging of DW drums as the ""Mercedes of drums..."" etc. In my opinion, hyping a brand isn't appropriate in a book, especially when I have a feeling the author is a paid endorser of such brand."
5,Works Great,"The product works great, it does what it say it will do. All the stains from my couch are gone. Unfortunately lost some of the precious liquid during shipping, the bottle cap was not tight all the way and some of the liquid spilled in the bag. I recomend this product to remove permanet marker stains from fabric."
1,Disappointed,"The only reason I bought this product was because it was supposed to remove permanent marker stains and I had an orange marker leak into a white pocket. For years I have known about hairspray to remove ink stains. Not only did this product NOT touch the permanent marker stain, it also did NOT remove ink stains as well as common hairspray. I was very disappointed."
