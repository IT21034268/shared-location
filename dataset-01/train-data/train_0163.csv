4,One of the first (& only) books to address midlife lesbians,"This is an interesting book that covers such topics as: the impact of midlife on the lesbian couple, friendships at midlife, taking care of dying parents, dating, chemical dependency and parenting.It's an excellent read for lesbian therapists and glbt-friendly therapists to gain a better grasp of lesbian concerns.Barb Elgin(...)"
2,Did They Do Their Research????????,"I'll be honest with you. I only read the section which interviewed the lady from South Texas on Mexican American cooking. But I came across enough errors, to indicate that the journalism was pretty sloppy, at least in this section. Errors which should not have been made and which could have been avoided by checking a couple of sources and coincidentally would have made for a more interesting story.Example 1: ""Taco"" is defined as a snack. The word taco comes from ""wedge"" or ""wad"", the wadding such as was used to stuff a cannon or rifle. Because tortilla tacos were originally soft and round, well, you can see how you'd get to the image of stuffing a wad of food into your mouth.Example 2: A little research would have turned up that enchilada is a shortened form of tortilla enchilada, ""chili'ed tortilla"" in other words. They shouldn't have missed this one.Example 3: The dicho for ""como el agua para chocolate"" is completely wrong."

2,Sounds very tin-like,"Bought this one for my daughter. I was very disappointed with the dead tin-like sound this instrument produced. I changed the strings, but this didn't make a great deal of difference. I expected a little more quality for the price... this guitar did not deliver."
4,Maria makes me laugh ......,".........Yet I did find the poignant ending teary. Thank you for sharing your life's journey with us you have inspired generations and ....,yes ,The Lord opened this window of music woven into the fabric of family during fun times and difficult days"
5,Refreshing and informative.,"This is the original book that was written before ""The Sound of Music"" was ever thought of. It is written by Maria von Trapp herself and has the story of their lives before, during and after the period reflected in the film. The energised personality of the writer conmes through clearly, making one think about the difference one's outlook on life can bring to those around you. If you ever wondered what came before and after ""The Sound of Music"" this is the book for you."
5,Great!,"A really wonderful story.A bit disillusioning as the real story is a bit different to the movie,but still an amazing family with an inspiring tale to tell"
5,A DELIGHTFUL BOOK!!VERY INSPIRING !!,"The Sound of Music is my favorite movie, so I HAD to track this book down and read it.I was not disappointed!Maria inspired me with her faith in God and his help through all the trials of life. She also had SO MANY MORE STORIES TO TELL THAT NEVER MADE IT INTO THE MOVIE. One example: I was interested to know that their mansion in Austria was made into a Nazi Headquarters after the family fled. Once, when Hitler was visiting, he overheard one of the German soldiers whistling a tune which happened to be of Russian origin. Hitler was so enraged that he ordered all the German guards present to be shot.This book is one of the best books that I have ever read.--George Stancliffe"
4,The Trapp Family Singers,"I had a copy of this book as a child and lost it so was thrilled to find it on Amazon. It's not the best quality paper, but was just fine."
4,"Maybe not completely true, but still throughly readable","I, too, saw the A&E Biography of the Von Trapp family, which revealed the ""real"" story. So, while reading Maria's book, I had to be somewhat skeptical when she characterized herself as a decent, noble, loving mother, always ready to do the will of God, (Well, she probably was, at least in part.) Despite this skepticism, I still enjoyed the book. Parts of it are quite humorous, and others are filled with richly detailed descriptions of Austrian folk life and thier celebrations of holidays. Some parts were even a little moving, too. It was nice to hear what really went on, even if Maria left certain things out conveiently. There's no reason why anyone shouldn't read this, especially if they're interested in the story behind The Sound of Music. Even if it isn't the complete true story, it's still throughly engaging. And it's got to be at least half-true, so, oh, well."
5,For Sound of Music Lovers,"If you are obsessed with the Sound of Music like me, then this book is a must-read. It answers all of your questions about the film and about the real lives of the von Trapps, such as: Did the family really climb a mountain to escape? Did the Captain really use a whistle to summon his children? What happened to their enormous home in Austria?I loved the fiesty side of Maria that came through in her writing, and I chuckled as she relayed her struggles with learning English.Maria also discusses the places she lived and visited in Austria. If you ever get a chance to go to Salzburg, go, go, go! There's nothing like running through the gardens or spinning on the Alps. And even if you can't, this book makes you feel like you're right there with Maria."
4,A fun and uplifting read,"This was a very enjoyable book about the Von Trapp family. It was fascinating to find out how many things in the film, The Sound of Music, actually happened, as well as how many things were different. Maria Von Trapp also shares the role faith had in sustaining the family through some very difficult times. I recommend this to all who would enjoy a relaxing and positive book. The second half of the book does lag in spots, but the overall reading experience makes the book worthwhile and fun reading for ambitious upper elementary students through adults."
1,Totally Worthless,"I could have learned more than this from 15 minutes of reading an outline. She is basically reading a simple outline, and not a very good one at that.Avoid!"
3,Looks better on the site than when you hold it in your hand....,"Hi!I am a die hard flash fan and to me... this wouldn't be the best attempt at a statue. Firstly, If you are a collector of figures, this one could definitely have been taller. At 8 and a quarter inches(with base), this is not a figure which you can place more than 3-4 feet from the eye. Also, the detailing is fairly simplistic, the running motion seems stiff and the expression on the face is deadpan.If you want to buy a statue because you like detail, this one is not it. If you don't, you are better off buying an action figure. All said, an okay buy but only if you must.."
5,Wow,"I can't believe that I waited this long to buy this record. This is the album of the year... period. Dulli has done it again, and Blackberry Belle is just fantastic. This is a masterpiece. I don't know when this CD will not be in my CD player, it's that damn good. Even if you have never listened to the Afghan Whigs or anything that Mr. D has done before, do yourself a favor and go buy it now!"
5,Best Album of 2003,This album is amazing! Just get it. Forget the reviews (which are all good anyway) and get it. From start to finish this is an incredible album.
3,3.5 stars,"There is some good stuff on here, but the overall quality of the album is lower than its follow-up, Powder Burns. Far and away the best song is ""Feathers,"" with its funky rhythm section, wah-wah guitar, and sentimental pop melody. Also very good is ""Teenage Wristband"" which teases us with a facsimile of the piano flourish from Vanessa Carlton's teenage angst hit ""A Thousand Miles"" and then turns it completely on its head. The last winner on the album is ""Esta Noche,"" a sophisticated groove that Dulli crafts from the sound of a foreign dial tone. Other than ""Fat City (slight return)"" none of the other songs really grabbed me. As mentioned, Powder Burns is a much stronger album and has some great songs. Pick that one up first if you don't already have it."
1,Depressing and boring!,"It does not take much to write depressing lyrics and dark harmonies. It's just hard to get into this record unless you want to jump off a bridge. Slow, low-key and NO energy. It should really be called a Greg Dulli solo project because it does not have a group feel."
4,A Long Journey,"I watched part of the process of the research for this book, and have used the system for some years. In the beginning, I was curious, but I got hooked early on. The suggested exercises are very interesting and revealing (mostly of self). The work is extremely well researched. I would recommend this book (and have!) to anyone who wants to work with some beginning Celtic material, or to more advanced folk who want something to enrich their practice."
2,This cd seemed to short change us the fans,"This is one more Rosemary Clooney cd that I have added to my collection. It's really not one to write home about. Let me try to explain my less than enthusiastic feeling about this cd. I think that the idea to record a cd with the great Count Basie Orchestra was grand one. As far as the orchestra goes they did their thing. They delivered a whale of a performance. Where the real problem areas came from are at Rosemarys' end.First off, I thought the repertoire was a little weak. Secondly, I thought that Rosemary tried to be too cute by changing the lyrics on some of the songs.. This cd could have been a lot better, if it could have been more conservative. Well, you can't win them all can you? Better luck next time!Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
1,Pissed the f*** off!,"As much as I love watching this show, I was really upset that ""BASKETBALL WIVES"" on DVD was not uncensored like the ""MOB WIVES"" DVD was! I felt cheated and wasted my money."
3,An Interesting Collection of Literary Fiction,"This new collection of stories, edited by Michael Chabon, aims to ""reinvigorate the stay-up-all-night, edge-of-the-seat, fingernail-biting, page-turning tradition"" (taken from the book's back cover) of literary short fiction. For me, that was about half right. Half the stories had me on the edge of my seat and didn't let up for a moment, such as ""Lusus Naturae"" by Margaret Atwood, ""The Fabled Light-house at Viña del Mar"" by Joyce Carol Oates, and the astonishing ""7C"" by Jason Roberts (probably the best of the collection). The other half seemed a bit unclear and left me wondering what I had just read.The collection includes some already well-known authors - Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates, Peter Straub - and introduces some welcome newcomers (to me, anyway) - Ayelet Waldman, Jason Roberts, Roddy Doyle. As a whole, this collection was hit and miss; however, the hits make it worth reading."
3,Very uneven collection,"I've often said that a collection of short stories is going to contain some good, some bad, and some indifferent. This collection, however, with very few notable exceptions (Stephen King, for one), contains stories that were not very good and did not hold my attention. Some of them were so poorly written that I found myself looking ahead to where the story would end, a sure bad sign for a person such as myself, who lives to read. I honestly expected better from this collection, after the first one was so good, but this was a great disappointment!"
3,Less than astonishing.,"Sorry McSweeney, the chamber is less than enchanted and the stories are only marginally astonishing. The name writers King, Oates, help save the day, but don't seem up to their usual standard."
1,An insult to the intelligence!,These secrets should remain secret because in a real confrontation they will get you hurt!
4,The Ark of millions of years:2012 and the harvest of the end of times,This work was a good extention to my quest for knowledge about 2012
3,"Works, but short range","Works great for my wife's printer in the basement, but doesn't work well for my printer in the attic...no idea why..."
3,Watch out for 7 digit phone numbers,"Dear Readers,I bought this book before going to Botswana Summer 2002. This book was useful, but most of the phone numbers are incorrect since the govt. has not completely switched over to 7 digits from 6 digits. It did help me go on vacation while there and gave me some good ideas of what to do. The maps are rather inadequate also.EAC"
2,not comprehensive,"I found this guide barely scratches the surface of travel possibilities in Botswana, offering few choices within each price range, and scant historical or cultural information. If you plan to visit only northern Botswana or the Central Kgalagadi (as most tourists so) then better to purchase the Bradt guide, which even after 2 years in Botswana, I still find interesting. The sight seeing and accomodation information in Lonely PLanet guide is meager at best, offering few choices. In Botswana, the best and most interesting places are off the beaten path, and Lonely Planet did not bother to find many of them for their readers. If you plan on visting southern or eastern Botswana (near Gaborone or Selebi-Phikwe) then buy a guide that includes South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia as well. This guide was fairly useless to me and has hardly left my bookshelf in the 2 years I've been in Bots! For a truly enjoyable holiday, buy a different guide."
1,"BOMB, a very big Bomb.","This cd is so bad that it does""t even deserve a rating ,it is so bad that i couldn""t even give it away.There's only one thing i can do with this cd, and that is to throw it away"
5,excellent combination,The wonderful combination of afro sounds with classical music its an exquisit experiment I can not wait to see whats next.
5,"BEST CD, BEST SONGS","We have enjoyed so much our new Chi Chi Peralta CD and we think that we made an exellent purchase at Amazon, we recommend it."
5,Finally I got it,I was looking for it for a year in Venezuela and I didn`t find it. Finally I got it trought AMAZON.COM. Thanks.........
4,"hearty, a bit dry","I have crackers every morning with my coffee. My husband has crackers every morning with his tea. We differ on our taste for crackers as well as on our taste for beverages. We both want a full grain cracker. But, my husband enjoys the Wasa Crispbread, Hearty crackers. Me...not so much. I far prefer the Finn Crisp variety. The four stars above reflect his review. In short, if you prefer a thick cracker, go for Wasa. If you like the crackers to be crispy and not so dry...go for Finn Crisp or something similar."
4,good snack bread,"I received these free of charge from Wasa in order to do a review & post about it on my blog, read here - http://dailyvitaminf.blogspot.com/2011/12/wasa-review-giveaway.html.When I first tried these, I thought the texture was similar to stale bread. Althought the texture is extremely crunchy, the taste is great. There are so many ways to eat them (if you look at the recipes on their blog) & a lot of them are sooo good. If you are looking for a healthy snack, Wasa breads are the way to go. Even better than the crispbreads are the flatbreads. They are more like crackers, but have the ""healthy"" appeal."
2,A little disappointed,"A friend recommended this magnetic bracelet because of relief they received for carpal tunnel. I wore it for about 2 months and have no relief. I also tried it to help with a bout of vertigo, but it didn't help with balance either.Be cautious of wearing them near watches, it drains the battery. I did not have success with this item."
1,Cures good moods,"If you are feeling upbeat, this is a good antidote. Lacks musicality, not even scary (scary is good, even Mannheim Steamroller and Erich Kunzel have done scary quite well, not to mention A CLOCKWORK ORANGE of same performer), just running off in all directions at once with distortion generators. To the Salvation Army donation bin, then Dramamine cabinet."
2,A bit dissapointing/depressing,"I have every album of Wendy's, and this is the 1st one that didnt make me want to run downstairs to my studio and make synthesizer music. It's a pretty depressing album all-around, and kindof bland, with the exception of the 1st piece, Transitional, which is superb. Wendy also seems to have quite a few unresolved religious issues which surface here in a pretty creepy way."
1,"ok, what am I missing here??","Dark? Scary? Hardly!I figured after seeing the cover and the reference to ""Clockwork Orange"" that I couldn't lose with this...wrong. Sounds like somebody with a keyboard and way too much time on their hands. There's nothing in the very least interesting on this disc, let alone scary. I found it to be a complete waste of time. You want dark/scary check out Basil Poledouris' works...Robocop, Conan, Starship Troopers, etc."
4,"trippy?Indeed,sir!","this is every bit as good as the Clockwork Orange score,and it doubles as a great halloween album that won't scare the kiddies TOO much.(I had some visitors last year that found the ""death cube k"" cd a bit too frightening though,unfortunatly.) I like putting on this cd while the backlight and strobe are going in my room for a cool effect.also,""trendy""folks that think old 60,70,80's electronic music is lame should steer clear of this,cause trippy as it is,I could see how some could find it cheesy-stick with bill laswell,paul van dyke,etc if you do.otherwise,the only complaint I have about the album are the robot voices at the start of ""clockwork black"",but they only go on for about a minute or two and the track is perfect other than that(and 17 minutes long to boot!)get it if you're a true ""tripper""!"
2,I played it three times and tossed it.,"Wendy was satisfied with this recording, but it lacks the conflict with the music equipment which made her early work fun to listen to. This is tame and lame."
1,Switch does not turn off,"Switch turns on ok...but does not turn off about 3/4 of the time. Tried turning it on to max, then back to 10 minutes or so...still does not turn off 3/4 of the time."
3,Just picked this up at Target for 9.99,"Haven't watched them yet, so can't comment on the quality...but Target did have it for $9.99. I wasn't sure if I should get it because usually these Echo Bridge 4 packs are sold at Walmart or K-Mart for $5.00. Either way, a good deal for 4 decent movies."
2,These Aren't Wes Craven Films!,Wes Craven didn't DIRECT any of these. The presentation is decent but I think the set is misrepresented just to get sales off Craven's name.
2,Trebuchet,"This trebuchet was very easy to assemble-an hour and a half max. The clay that it came with fell apart pretty much right after I took it out of the plastic bag. The sling was of very poor quality-it didn't hold the projectile in place, which in turn didn't let me fire it. I even had my physics teacher try and help me, and neither of us could figure it out. Overall, not the best buy I've made."
3,nice tv but horrible high pitched noise/ reflective screen,"We bought this tv after our 20 yr old one quit. We were so excited to get a new one, did lots of research, and got this one at Best Buy. Compared to the Toshiba, which I really wanted, this had superior picture quality and sound. We got the set home, set it up, and almost immediately, this high-pitched noise comes from the back of the tv, and boy is it annoying! I called the company, who, after I convinced the noise was heard at least 10 feet away, (and over shows) recommended a local tv repair shop. I am so very disappointed with this noise. The only other complaint I have about it is the mirror-like screen - you can see nearly everything reflected back from the tv monitor, so we have to turn out some lights to be able to see the picture more clearly. Great tv otherwise."
2,"Great disposable television, not for Shackleton.","I bought this TV in January of 2004 after an Emerson (i know what was I thinking) lasted only 2 months before showing it's LSD simulation feature. I thought the sound, picture quality, options etc. on the Phillips were great...when it was working. In June it started shutting itself off and then after getting really moody it just quit functioning entirely (in my opinion)except for daintily lighting a little green light on the front panel making me think that something might be stirring within. So in light of the fact that, through years of product development and research, Phillips can make a grown man sit staring at a green light hoping that his television will turn on in time to see the World Superbike Championships or even Gunsmoke, I give it 2 stars rather than a 0. At just over 14 months of faithful service, longevity was not one of it's virtues. Ernest Shackleton would be very dissapointed."
1,Crazy stuff mine went out 2,"And after the warrenty i had to pay 70 more dollars to get it fixed. It started making a chirping noice when it was plugged in and had no picture, Just the chirping. VERY BADD TELEVISION."
1,Philips TVs are real lemons,"I was so heartbroken at my TV shutting itself off and making spooking clicky noises that finding the same story from other Philips 'victims' was actually a pleasure.My set was just under 2 years old and yes, my warranty ran out 3 weeks ago. And I, too, would give it less than 1 star if it were possible.But I'm glad to know ahead of time what it would cost to fix --- heck, I'm just going to buy a new one, but never again will it be a Philips."
1,Never buy this TV,Great picture. Lousy TV. Mine quit working after 4 months. Conveniently 1 month after the full-coverage warranty. If you've read the other reviews you know to stay away from this and any Philips TV.
3,High Pitched Noise,"I bought an older model of this TV about 3 years ago, and I also have had problems with the high pitched noise it gives off. It's incredibly annoying and distracting when you're trying to watch a good show. The sound is of course most noticable when the volume is lower. I wouldn't buy another Phillips. Pay a little more money for a better brand!"
1,if you read the other reviews you know what happened to mine,"I've had the t.v. for about 8 months. Last night it decided to just start turning off, losing the picture and sound while it was still running. That's a problem. It comes back on for about a minute and shuts down. Needless to say that if i'm one of many seeing this problem, you would be well suited to buy a different television."
1,"After owning for a year, it turns on and off","After owning this set of a year, it started having problems when you power it on. It will give a loud click (like a relay turning off), then shut down. If you turn it on and flip the channels for 2 - 3 minutes non stop it will start working. And yes it's on a power surge protector. Would not recommend this brand."
1,Run from this TV,This TV is probably not available anymore but its still worth posting the problem. This TV just starts turning itself off and eventually will not turn back on. It'll work for 4 years IF you're lucky. Go with Sony or Sharp or Sansung or ANY other brand.
2,too short of a life,"I was very pleased with this tv for the first two years. Great picture, great sound. About a month ago, was having very similar problems to the review here dtd July 5th but after a few minutes of turning it on, everything would be ok again. As of yesterday, no picture and no sound, only a few flashes on screen before black and repeat clicking noises from back of tv. The green power light remains.Really disappointed in such a short life. Not sure what brand to try next."
2,Vonnegut shouldn't quite his day job.,"On top of the world after the success of ""Slaughterhouse 5"", Vonnegut decided to try his hand at playwriting. Why not? His able hand at believable character sketching would make this seem obvious. But before the first line has even ended, it becomes obvious where Vonnegut is going: Pretention land. Oh, sure, the play DOES right itself a bit in the second act. But by then, who cares? The laughs a bound as the plot sweeps out of boundaries. Vonnegut may have been a bit hard on the work in future years, rating it a dismal ""D-"" in ""Palm Sunday."" But it is one piece that might best be left out of print; it is one experiment that didn't work out"
5,A great resource for the study of Ephesians,"A great resource book for the layperson or serious student of Ephesians or the writings of Paul. The author writes an in-depth study, but uses language, proofs, and arguments that are easy to cross-reference and understand."
5,A great product!,"Here's another one of those lower-priced products that promises so much, and probably delivers nothing, right? Wrong! This shampoo and conditioner from Pantene really works!First of all, let's start with what it's not. It's not a dying shampoo which will make your hair brown, or even a different shade of brown. Quite to the contrary, Brunette Expressions has no color enhancing ingredients whatsoever.Instead, Brunette Expressions is an excellent shampoo and conditioner that somehow works with your hair's color to not change it (as the daily use of some products will!), but to actually make it look more rich. I love the way that Brunette Expressions makes my hair so soft and lustrous, and so very manageable. This is a great product, one that I highly recommend to all my fellow brunettes!(Review of Pantene Pro-V Brunette Expressions Daily Color Enhancing Conditioner for Darker Brunette Shades, Nutmeg to Dark Chocolate)"
2,Not what I expected!,"I was dissapointed in the contents and projects in this book. Although beautiful, I think most were impractical. I also felt the book would be giving help and ideas for embroidery machines, not just embroidering on a standard sewing machine. While I would like to embellish cloth with embroidery, this book seemed beyond a beginner in scope and terminology."
5,Interesting choice of songs.,"For example, why is Closer Than Close on here? Don't know, don't care. They did an excellent job of picking some great love songs over the Bee gees career. Love So Right would have been a perfect addition to this album because it's one of their greatest singles and talks about love's goods and bads. It's good to see songs like Emotion, Heartbreaker, and Islands In The Stream on this collection. All songs are digitally remastered and have excellent sound quality. Interesting collaboration of songs. So check it out."
1,This was the worst book I ever read!,"I read this book 2 months ago. I don't like AT ALL. The narrator's name isn't even given. Also,the plot was cliche. (...). If you see this book DON'T READ IT!!! I gave this a 1 star only because it was actually published."
5,Never Forget Your Best Friends,"I give this book five stars. It was a great book, and it also made me sad. I think he will make new friends, but he'll never forget Jamie. Jamie was his best friend. I recommend this book to you if have alot of feelings for your friends."
3,Still have nightmares,I read this book when I was in 4th grade...I am now 40....This book still gives me nightmares. It was a good book to read but very emotional.
4,A TASTE of BLACKBERRIES,I hope you like this book as much as i did.IT has eghit chapters but it does not take long to read.In the story Jamie on of the charecters gets stung and dies.Have fun reading a taste of blackberries.
5,It was a great book!,This book would be a great book for any child dealing with the loss of a loved one. It shows how others handle that type of situation.
3,A Amazing Blackberrie Story,"This is a story of two boys went to pick blackberries.On the way back they started runing and some bees followed them and Jamie got stung by one and fell.Everyone thought they were playing a joke on them.But they new something was wrong because Jamie didn't lie like that, like he always did.So if you want to find out the rest of the story read A taste Of Blackberries."
2,Memories,"I read this book about 7 years ago while in the fourth grade, I have always reguarded the book as one of the few books assigned by school I have truly despised. To this day I can remember the anger I felt towards the book. I was not angry to have to read it but at the way it was written, I believe it to be something that should not be read until children are much older than 10, possilbly older that even 15."
5,Thank You,This book is for one of my son's teachers. Thank you for the speedy delivery of this book. Nice doing business with you.
3,I thought It was too short.,"Over all I thought it was a good book. Jamie was this guy who was named the town clown and always made people laugh. Hes friend, who I can't remember his name for the life of me, and him used to play all the time get in trouble together. Jamie was w/ hes friends picking beetles off the bushes for a neighbor and they all got attacked by bees. jamie died b/c he was allergic to bees and then the rest of the story was hes friend trying to deal with the sudden death of his friend."
1,Quite Boring(Yawn),Maybe it was just that this book was too simple but I found it very boring and the story line is basically what people go through in their lives. Someone close to you dies and you move on I would not recommend this book to you basically because it is a played out storyline and I do not think the author spent too much time on this book which I think was probably thought of in ten minutes and written in twenty minutes and published. I mean come on dying from a bee sting I find that more comical than sad in my eyes
3,So-so compilation from a funk icon!,"The members of Parliament/Funkadelic worked better collectively than they did individually. Although Clinton, as well as band mate Bootsy Collins, had some success as solo artists, their collaborations with the rest of the funk band created some of the more memorable jams from the 70's.The seminal Clinton opus ""Atomic Dog"" is represented twice on this disc and it is the only song that isn't stuck in the era of its release. The others are fun for those of us OLD enough to remember them, but for newer audiences, they didn't age well."
2,Dull,"Young James led a perfectly happy life - that is, until his parents were killed by an evil rhinoceros stormcloud. Now he must escape his harridan aunts and journey to New York City in a giant magical peach to fulfill his and his parents' dream. Yowza.This is the sort of film where you realize that you are supposed to be entertained, but something isn't working. The whole thing is surreal and creepy, but there is far too much figurative language and imagery here - the thing screams ""the world as seen through the eyes of an idealistic child"". James' companions - Centipede, Ladybug, Grasshopper, Earthworm, Spider, and Glow Worm - are nicely characterized but completely flat parodies of the various social groups, but since most of the film is a passive journey, they have little to do but squabble. James faces a number of sophisticated dilemmas, including how to harness a flock of seagulls, and what there is to eat on a giant peach.A bit less metaphor, and it would've been so much better..."
3,REALLY THREE AND A HALF.,"THIS MOVIE WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE.I EXPECTED IT TO BE KINDA FUNNY,AND HAVE BETTER ANIMATION.IT WAS`NT THAT BAD,IT JUST WAS`NT WAHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE FROM THE PREVIEWS!"
1,James and the Giant Peach DVD,"The DVD won't play in this region. I didn't even know there were regions! However, ""Hear and Now"" has offered a full refund if I send it back."
2,What do you mean fun?!,"I saw this movie on the theater to see this Tim Burtons produced film, and surprise! the movie sucked, the music is based from the book and the book is based from Roal Dahl, but it was a tragic disaster, even the good music and songs from Randy Newman(Toy Story, A Bug's Life) doesn't save the damn movie, at least it's better than Tim Burton's previous film The NigthMare Before Christmas."
4,"One of the best movies made since ""Nightmare.""","I personally like ""James and the Giant Peach"" because it's a movie that has something in it for everyone. The animation is great and I like the songs. My siblings enjoy it too. One of my brothers can't even hear the title without going berserk, because he really likes the Centipede. I like it becuase Jack Skellington (The hero from ""Nightmare Before Christmas"") makes a cool cameo appearance in it. It doesn't surprise me. Tim Burton was one of the producers. Anyway, it is a cute story and has something evryone in the family can enjoy. ""James"" is also very detailed. Inside the peach, you can recognize everday items that are literally larger than life, like a spool of thread and a seed packet. The only reason I give four stars is because it isn't as detailed as it should be, and the animation could use a little bit of improvement."
4,"A little dark, but a lot of fun!","I purchased this movie as part of a rebate deal with another Disney movie for my three-year-old daughter. It's a little dark in spots, but overall, a really fun picture with great music, great characters and great special effects! It's one of my daughter's favorites and has some very nice morals at the end: ""Do unto others..."" and ""Good things happen to good people"". Recommend highly, but probably not for under three years old."
3,"Hey, Look, This Gift Horse Has A Cavity....","Bit disappointing, really. What with so much talent coming into this project from the standpoint of writers, filmmakers, and the voices of some truly cool people, I guess I expected too much. The Nightmare Before Christmas and the printed version of James and the Giant Peach both felt magical to me, and this movie was mostly a big sticky mess in soggy peach form. Sigh. I hate letdowns. Talking about them makes me sound all whiny. Am I being whiny? I dunno. What went wrong here? A lot. This animated behemoth of a production should have been darker in tone and content, and the brooding elements in the Roald Dahl book should not have been toned down just to strike out for a larger audience---which is I think what happened. Well, three stars isn't a total slam, it just means things could've been better. (Particularly those songs!!!)"
5,Original twist on classic plot.,"What nonsense that this is too traumatic - next we won't tell the children that the wolf ate grandma and red riding hood. The world is full of all kinds of people, kind and cruel, better my children have their instincts validated that you must be discerning about who you trust. Anyways, this is one of the top 3 favorites in the house thanks to the fantastic animation and the imaginative play on an essentially classic story line. The music is delightful and I find myself signing songs from it to the kids all the time. Home is where the heart is and kids need to feel secure that even the rocky road that life delivers does not mean that they cannot effect change and find a loving and supportive home, even if it is not their first choice. They do have strength and power, if not magic and this movie does nothing but foster a sense of empowerment and hope."
1,Where's the HD?,"Amazon, please stop marking movies as HD that are no where near HD quality only to get more money out of us. I know that this is becoming common practice with old movies that are sold on Blu-ray, but because there is so little information about the movie when you rent or buy it through the Amazon Instant Video player on the Playstation3, it is hard to make an informed decision without taking the time to do some research online first.For the movie itself, my son did not like it and told me to turn it off 30 minutes into it. Lesson learned."
3,Disney Skimped on Picture Quality,I Purchased this movie on blu-ray and the DVD I bought 5 - 7 years earlier looked cleaner than the Blu-ray. Very Disapointed! The Picture quality of the movie on blu-ray was dark and extremely grainy. I have never seen a film on blu-ray from any company let alone Disney to be this grainy and dark. I checked the dvd that came with the blu-ray and the picture quality was the same. Very grainy and dark. So I took out my dvd copy from 5-7 years ago and the picture was much brighter and not grainy at all. It was ok for a dvd but it actually looked better than the blu-ray combo pack! Sad! I never returned it because the disc played perfectly fine. I just figured all the copies would be the same so why bother returning it. Wish Disney would fix this. They used a poor master to make the blu-ray and dvd combos from. Wasn't very clear at all. All their other releases on blu-ray look stunning. Just not james and the Giant Peach!
5,Horrific? hardly...,"just because something is animated doesn't necessarily mean that it's for children. it's rated PG for pete's sake! in my opinion, the positive aspects outway the negative. seriously, shouldn't the fact that sometimes life can be hard, but there is ALWAYS something YOU can do to make it better (with a little help from your friends) be a lesson every child should learn? james faced hardship and overcame it. he wasn't alone. he found friends. if your child can't accept the fact that life has ups and downs, perhaps you should re-evaluate your parenting skills instead of labeling this film ""horrific"". the fact that an Adult can't deal with the issues in this film to the point of not being able to watch it really terrifies me. i guess i find it ""horrific"" that people who are that sheltered are raising children. reality is a challenge."
4,Movies,My daughter has watched this several times usually in waiting rooms and some appointments and what not. But it is great as far as quality goes and it doesn't mess up at all.
3,A little disappointing...,"I think my expectations were set too high :) After all, the book was one of my favorite childhood books, not to mention the fact that this movie was produced by the same team who brought us the wonderful ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". Well... I was a little disappointed. First, as opposed to TNBS, this movie is clearly geared towards a younger audience. Second, the movie is ""Disneyfied"", there's too little ""Burtonism"" (if you're a Burton fan you know what I'm talking about)and absolutely no Danny Elfman... boo hoo hoo. Third, there's simply not enough animation here and the live action parts are... well... pretty stupid. All in all, great potential, but the end result is a little disappointing and forgettable."
2,weird movie,"I though this movie was strange compared to the book, and the bugs were creepy looking. A lot of the dialogue was hard for the kids to understand. We thought it was OK at best. (boys are ages 5 & 7)"
1,Bad DVD!,DVD had no start Menue! None of my 5 Dvd players would play it!Same error message! No Start Menue!
3,Not as great as I remembered...,"Although I enjoyed this movie, as did my son...it wasn't the great movie I had built up in my mind from when i was younger.Good movie. If you like Tim Burton you will enjoy this movie."
5,fast good service,"Quick Delivery, factory sealed as noted. Haven't watched it yet giving that it is a Christmas present but I am for sure my son will be happy with it."
2,Just couldn't get in to it,"This is a ""classic"" that I just couldn't get in to. The plot started too slow for my attention. If you remember the book from childhood and want to re-live the tale... then maybe."
3,Second time around,"Watched again at visitor request. Older crowd, not as impressive as with little ones around to discuss it with. So-so."
4,Great Animation,"James and the Giant Peach is a great fantasy story filled with creative characters and imaginative ideas. As a follow up to the chapter book, I showed this movie to my 5th grade class. They loved it and laughed a lot! After the movie, the class and I developed a Venn Diagram comparing the book to the movie. I was amazed at all the similarities and differences the students came up with! I think that the director's interpretation of the book was good, but the book is better. Nonetheless, I still recommend the movie."
4,Fun ride,"My children really liked this story. It was a little short and needed a little more adventure but, we are still happy we purchased it."
5,Excellent video,My two year old son loves to watch this movie over and over. An excellent video that keeps him entertained.
2,I remember seeing this movie,"I saw this movie when I was in elementary school. We went on a field trip. We went to a park after the movie. I was waiting in line to use the restroom and I shouted at one of the teachers for not letting me use it before before we left the park. My teacher did not like my behavior and she told me to owe the person an apology and I refused. As result I was not allowed to go on their field trip with them. I was 11 at that time, but I'm 21 now."
2,I couldn't even get past the first 30 mins,"My 3 year old daughter did not like it at all, she tuned out after about 5 mins. I tried to keep going but I just couldn't follow it. Maybe I should've read the book 1st so I would've understood what was going on."
5,Love it!,"Fast delivery, good value! We live where only ""new releases"" and TV shows are easy to find-- this was VERY helpful!Thanks!"
5,good to see in hi def,I watched this with my kids all the time when they where growing up. I was really happy to see it put out in the blu-ray format.It is still a good movie.
1,Not (typical) Disney Animation - nearly black and white,We rented this for New Years Eve for our family to watch together. We only watched maybe the first 20 minutes - none of us were enjoying it. The promotional poster/picture they show is NOTHING like the movie animation - the movie is nearly black and white - very very little color except the peach. The first 15 minutes or so are real people then it morphs into a Tim Burton typical cartoon-like animation. Blech. If it looked like the picture they advertise the movie with and had vibrant colors like that - mixed with typical Disney and/or Pixar animation it would have been a fantastic movie but no one wanted to watch it the way it is. I don't recommend. This version was creepy and the lack of color was depressing. Hoping Pixar picks up James and the Giant peach - think they could make a fantastic version.
2,Okay,Watched this with my four year old. The arttest rendition of the animation was a little too much for an full length feature. The content was okay
3,Roald Dahl and Tim Burton,"When I first heard Tim Burton was making a film of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, I knew the mesh of styles was a very natural fit. The same thing applies here.However, I believe this was based on a short story. So the folks responsible for this film padded it with musical numbers -- I hate singing in my movies -- and still wound up with only 80 minutes.And that is the ONLY reason I dropped this down to three stars. Everything works, and quite well."
2,Perfect for Children; Fails to Entertain Adults,"All children should see this, better yet -read it. The book was actually read to my class by our fifth grade teacher and our imaginations really soared.The movie is a let down from the world I imagined. Also, this movie is not suitable for adults. It hardly held my attention, the songs are weak, and there is very little (if any) embedded adult humor.Adult Burton enthusiasts should avoid this movie."
4,good movie,"The movie itself is great, but for my three year old the movie is boring and she really was not interested in it at all"
4,I am a kid again LOL,I really liked this movie when I was younger. I still love it LOL. Don't rush to any presumptions. Pretty cool on Blu-ray.
3,It's okay,"Not one of my favorites, but the kids did enjoy watching it. They'd just read the book in school so they were excited to watch it."
3,I love this movie it's great!!!,"If you buy this combo pack. Just to let you allknow! The blu-ray disc HD is not that good for remaster of""JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH"". It""s better if you buy the DVD only."
1,Movie Quality,The viewing quality of the movie was extremely fuzzy and out of focus! I do not reccomend this movie for others it a waste of money!
2,Let down :(,"After reading the book with my son, we were disappointed that the movie did not follow the story line very well. The animation was ok, but overall it was a disappointment."
4,Godzilla: King of the Monsters,"I got the tape version of this. It is actually two Godzilla stories that is spoken. It features two stories: Godzilla vs. Amphibion and Godzilla vs. the Alien Invasion. Godzilla vs. Amphibion is about Godzilla and a swimming reptile with sharp lobster claws and a 100 foot tall fin on his back fighting in the Bermuda Triangle and Miami. Godzilla vs. the Alien Invasion is about Godzilla coming out of Lake Michigan and fighting some aliens and these type of ""slimy"" monsters. I liked these stories very much. Godzilla's roar is the one he had in ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" (the movie). I just wish it came with some pics or something like that. Nuff said."
5,Productive Use of Your Time,"To learn some Italian before visiting Italy, I tried multiple language-learning programs borrowed from my local library. Some were ridiculous, many required using a workbook. Then I stumbled on the Pimsleur program, which is totally audio, allowing me to learn Italian while I drove to and from work. Due to the pedagogically- sound method Pimsleur developed for language learning, I actually did learn some basic Italian. As a result I bought ""Conversational Italian."" Though I've never considered myself adept at language-learning, I actually felt confident in my ablility to learn Italian as a result of these CDs. I've raved about them to friends who have expressed interest in learning a language."
5,Love it!,"I am learning Italian quickly. Product arrived fast, and in perfect shape. The pimsleur approach to language works for me."
3,Conversational Italian,"No doubt about it, you'll learn Italian from these 8 CD, unfortunately the vocabulary is so limited that it will not help you in Italy. You may learn how to say I drink, but not know how to ask for water, or a glass of water. You'll learn how to say I'd like to eat, but not know what bread is in Italian."
2,"should be called ""Italian for Morons""","If you have an IQ of less than 75 and want to learn Italian, this lesson could be perfect for you. Another alternative title: Learn 10 italian Phrases in 8 Hours. If I want to repeat the phrases 500 times each I would normaly replay the lesson, but this book saves you the trouble of pressing the track replay button by simply repeating the same very simple phrases over and over and over and over and over and over. I am not exagerating. A complete waste of money. In the first hour you will learn the following phrases:Hello, how are you miss?I am fine.I am american. I am italian.I understand a little italian.I don't understand Italian.Do you understand English?and maybe one or two more... first graders learn at a faster pace than this!Try the BBC website for better lessons free!"
2,"Great if you need ""pick up lines""","I am taking my family to Italy this year and wanted to know the basics like ""where is...."" ""how much...."" ""do you speak English?"" etc. The first five chapters were very good but by chapter six, they were concentrating on ""do you want beer or wine at your place or mine...."" This theme continued throughout the remainder of the 16 chapters. I would have prefered to order soda or tea at a restaurant or cafe. With all this talk about beer and wine, they never once mentioned how to find a bathroom. Their learning style was fine, but I would have preferred the ""family version""."
2,"Too Little, Too Boring","Repetitive, boring, but sometimes effective. This set of CDs skirts around essentials, offerring too little to stand on its own as an introduction to Italian."
3,Audio Only - not good for visual learners.,"I thought we'd make good use of this program in our long car rides, but we found that we would forget the words and phrases within a day or two of hearing them and practicing. Maybe it would take more persistence - but I need to SEE the words, and KNOW how to SPELL them, something that this program can't give me as a whole.It's very clear recordings however, and the accents on the phrases are perfect. Definitely needed when you are learning Italian."
5,This is a fantastic program!,I was awful in French in high school. I figured that I didn't have the type of brain that could learn languages.I AM LEARNING TO SPEAK ITALIAN WITH THIS PROGRAM! It takes some time. I have to listen to each lesson about three times. Butit's working! I'm feeling confident that I'll be able to understand and communicate Italian when I go to Italy in threemonths. The only problem with this program is that you don't learn to read Italian. But what do you expect for $30.00? It'swell worth the price!
2,Don't Be Fooled Like I Was,This is another edition of the Sims 2 with added holiday items. I thought it was an expansion pack. I couldn't load it and finally figured out that I had purchased the Sims2 game again! I discovered at the Sims2 website that there is an add-on available called Party Pack but I haven't seen it for sale anywhere including here at Amazon. So I bought the same game twice to get a few Holiday items that aren't that great anyway.
5,The Sims 2 But Better,"When I heard there was a Sims 2 I was so excited, but when I heard there was a Sims 2 Holiday Edition I was shocked with joy! The Sims 2 Holiday Edition is basically The Sims 2 but with holiday items. You can celebrate Christmas, New Years, Halloween, and Easter. It's way better than The Sims, you can age your Sims, add make-up, and a lot more. The Sims 2 Holiday Edition is a Christmas Must-Have!"
2,Really disapointed....,"I was really excited when this finally came out but when I played it I was really disapointed. It slowed down my computer very much and it kept freezing. I couldin't even play it for 1 minute. Also when i did get to play it, it was really boring. Barely nothing happened. Also when I tired to unistall it I couldin't.... so I had to uninstall the whole Sims. I did not like this game at all."
2,Not another teen model!,"I'm a big fan of the Sims2 University, and the original Sims2. However, I found Holiday Edition revolting! There's absolutely nothing there and it ticks me off. I spent 32 blasted dollars on that baby and I might as well just gone and bought myself a new outfit! The only reason I play is to take pictures of the teenagers and make the neighborhood story title be ""Not Another Teen Model"" where there are pics of all the teenagers in the story.So if you bought this item, I have something to ask: HOW COULD YOU?"
3,Fun for a short while.,"This isn't a bad addition for your Sims as long as you don't expect an expansion pack along the lines of Sims University/ Nightlife. What you are buying is a disc that provides new outfits and goodies for your Sims to enjoy, such as Christmas trees, presents, festive lights, wreaths, decorations and so on. You can now cook a holiday feast and receive a visit from Santa too. Just make sure that you have a fire alarm installed before you put the Christmas tree lights on...oh, and don't pet the electric reindeer.This is an add on that is limited in its interest, fun at Christmas for a few days but not interesting enough to keep the interest levels high for long. Still, it is a low price, and it's always good to add to the Sims inventory."
5,The fun goes on!,"This is the best game ever! I'ts worth all your money! You can do so many new and cool things! You can create toddlers, children, teens, adults, and elders! There are tons of clothes, hairstyles, and make-up. You can even choose between fat and skinny Sims. They get older and have wants and needs. The aspiration choices are family, knowledge, money, popularity, romance, and, for kids and toddlers, grow up. They can cook lots of different things and have a new skill: cleaning. There are also lots of new jobs, social interactions, objects, and more! The possibilities are endless! I have been enjoying this game and I am sure you will, too!"
3,"well, it depends on how you look at it...","sims 2 holiday edition was not an expansion pack and EA clearly labled that if you pay attention to the site. the name says EDITION not EXPANSION. the other sims2 expnasion games clearly say expansion. it's more like an add on, new items not new interactions.its a nice edition- new items and you get into the spirit of the holiday. EA can't do everything at once. plus the fact that the Sims 2 + expansion packs are quite big in storage so take caution in Sims2.12 of the items you can download for free or for a small fee online but sometimes it overpowers your hard drive causing it to crash. or you know the people who publish their work on Sims2.com may have programs that you don't so you cant download on your computer.it all depends on what angle you look at it. there are many arguments on both sides."
5,CUTE!,So many cute holiday stuff on this!! I was kinda disappointed that I couldn't install this since it has the original Sims 2 and I already have the original Sims 2 on my laptop. I gave it my sister-in-law and she loves it! All is good!
1,Would be able to rate it if it worked!,"My kids were looking foward to playing the Sims 2 Holiday Expansion Pack, but when we got it, it would not install. I wouldn't even read disk 1. I also had EA tech support try to help me with the problem and they came up with no solutions. Please do not sell people defective products anymore. My kids are very upset with this problem we have now!"
5,ALL new content in this game available for FREE download on official site!,"Okay, I feel a duty to write this review, because if you're going to buy this game, or are even thinking about buying it, you should know that all of the holiday content is available for FREE on the official site. I actually bought the Holiday Pack (the one meant for those who already own The Sims 2 base game) and was SEVERELY disappointed and angered when Maxis began posting this same content on there website for FREE. That meant I had just wasted FIFTEEN bucks on something that, if I had just waited a week, I would've known that I could just go download this stuff without having to pay ONE red CENT.There is MUCH more they could've done with this pack, INCLUDING not charge what they did. I STRONGLY advise AGAINST buying it!!!"
3,Do your homework,"This is the holiday edition of the entire game. If you go to the EA website you can order the holday party pack for $15 which will give you the 40 bonus items. You can get some of these items for free on the websites but not all of them as far as my knowledge. The ""party pack"" also includes free shipping so all you'll be paying is the $15.Unfortunately, the description Amazon got from EA (I think) sucks and leads to people thinking this is a cheap scheme."
1,Sims 2 Holiday,"Well, unfortunately, we haven't been able to play this game as it didn't come with the manual, which has the code you have to enter in order to download the game. I've contacted the seller, but she was selling it for a friend and didn't know anything about the game.(She was very nice!)I also contacted EA games, but they want me to send a money order for $10.00, which we don't have right now due to Christmas, plus the whole reason for getting this used on line was the price. My 12 year old son is autistic and was real disappointed, so we will get it eventually.Thanks for letting me vent a little. lol"
2,Don't buy this if you own the sims 2,"I saw this game featured on the sims website as an add-on to your current sims games, so I thought it would be a great gift idea for someone so I went out and bought it. I thought the price was a little high for just an expansion but I got it anyway. When I got it home and looked at the package, it says it comes with the sims 2. I bought it for someone who already has the sims 2, university, and nightlife. So now I have to go through the hassle of returning it and ordering the right one from ea and hoping it will get to me on time for christmas."
4,Not the same as The Sims 2: Holiday Party Pack,"There is a Holiday Party Pack add-on for The Sims 2. This is not it. If you already have The Sims 2, the additional holiday features can be obtained at the EA Games website either as a download or as a CD for $14.95.This version, The Sims 2 Holiday Edition, simply give new The Sims 2 purchasers the ability to get these extras for free. For more information on the core product, check out the reviews for The Sims 2."
2,Just too Christian for me,"I was--and still am--a huge Superdrag fan. John's solo album does have a hint of the flavor of Superdrag, but don't buy it because you think it picks up where Vitriol left off. This is a no-holds-barred Christian album, and if you don't want to smacked upside the head by the praise of Jesus, you won't enjoy this album."
2,Big change from the 'drag,"The man is currently touring with superdrag again who made their living and fame off of songs like 'annetichrist' and 'nothing good is real' as well as songs about addiction and alcohol etc etc (I.E. the songs I grew up with and loved). They are reportedly playing their old stuff... so anyway, isn't this a bit two-faced after he dropped the alternative version of 'sister act' on us here?"
5,things of such beauty are so rarely found,"so many crap bands, so few great bands, not sure where these guys will go to, everyone says the top but who knows, but for the moment they're easily one of the best british bands and therefore one of the best bands in the world. give em ya money, you could do far worse."
4,"Some don't, but some do!!!!!!","The last CD I purchased by Ms Austin was ....well it was vinyl....called The Real Me. That became my favorite LP. B4 that, I had only bought a 12 single of ""Gonna Be Special"" (LOVE IT!!) This cd is jam packed with some great tunes but my favs are:1.In & Out of Love: Smooth and soulful!!! ""...doin' it sooo good""2.Why you Wanna..: nice club/house song that has an essence of Diana Ross (vocally) Patti is singing in an upper register. It sounds so good!3.Summerbreeze: There is an electric guitar on this song that drives me wild!!!!!!Great cd by an underrated singer!!!!"
3,Patti's voice still soars!,"For diehard Patti Austin fans such as myself, it is wonderful to have a new album to listen to. Once again, however, she presents us with inconsistent material. I could've done without the rap portion of Summerbreeze as well as Do-Si-Doe-In. On the other hand, her soulful and powerful voice on the golden oldie, Maybe, makes my hair stand on end! The title cut is quite very good but not her best. The ballads are as always her best! Although initially disappointed on first listen, listening over and over agin (as most true Patti fans do!), the album grows on you and it is better than on initial listen. If you've ever seen Patti in person, you know that she is capable of singing any type of music and her stage banter is always a good show! I still long for a truly great album full of consistent material for this unbelievale voice to really shine. Maybe then she'd have the ""breakthrough"" she truly deserves. Bring on more Patti!"
4,FALLING IN & OUT OF LOVE WITH PATTI!!,"PATTI AUSTIN HAS A GEM OF A VOICE,UNFORTUNATELY IN THE PAST SHE HAS NOT HAD THE CONSISTANTLY GOOD MATERIAL SHE DESERVES. ON HER LATEST RELEASE, SHE IS ON POINT SO TO SPEAK, THE MATERIAL SEEM'S TO BE HEARTFELT AS MS. AUSTIN DELIVER'S EACH LYRIC. IT IS NOT A CLASSIC PROJECT SUCH AS THE LOVE IS GONNA GET YOU CD,BUT CONSIDERING HOW INCONSISTANT HER MATERIAL HAS BEEN LATELY, IN AND OUT OF LOVE IS A PLEASANT COLLECTION OF MUSIC IN A WHOLE. PATTI AUSTIN FANS WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED,"
3,Not really innovative but it STILL is Patti Austin...,"After some time of semi-retirement, Patti Austin finally has a new record. After listening to this in & out of love, it is obvious that the voice is still the same, which is great. Where it is disappointing is when it appears that the album lacks a bit of consistency, and does not bring anything really new, in spite of the production of a man which is generally brilliant, Narada Michael Walden (he has produced artists like Michelle Gayle, Shanice, Steve Winwood etc). However, listen closely to the opening track, the totally unacceptable track (reminding the bass of groups like CHIC or INDEEP), and a very electric cover version of SEALS & CROFT'S ""Summerbreeze"". Other tracks are very romantic style. To be listened if you are in that mood. If you are an unconditionnal fan of Patti Austin, you will probably enjoy this album. If not, it certainly cannot be considered as the album of the year."
4,soul food,"in this situation that i have found myself, this cd has the right kick of soul stirring melodies and jazz improvisation that does its thang to your brain. the title cut in & out of love describes me to a ""t."" i love this woman i can't get enough of it especially at this time in my life. since baby come to me, with james ingram. i have been dedicated to this woman whos voice is angelic. this album proves that she can hang with the best of them"
5,Patti still shines.,"Patti with her multi facets in singing styles still shines on this album though as ever it is still inconsistent in style but great. All slow songs are fantasticaly great but always lack recognition and air play but nonetheless, us Patti fans loves them. Her latest album Street of Dreams is a more focus one, going on the jazz side of her. It is another gem for all Patti fans and music lovers alike. Patti's music is like great wine and in time pass it still shines."
4,Nice Case,"The case was in great condition. The broken handle was easily fixable and saved a lot of money on a full priced case. My Gibson SG fits in nicely with only a minor gap between the case and the bottom of the guitar body. Otherwise, the case is as described will aid in my travelling endeavors."
4,A True American Original.,"Steve Richmond's poetry is probably the best ""undiscovered"" writing in America today. This reissued volume of old and new poems is good, but his best book is the long out-of-print tome EARTH ROSE. Regardless, or maybe in spite, of Richmond's relationship with American-icon Charles Bukowski, these poems stand up and holler on their own."
4,you need this.,"What more is there to say about Foetus that has not already been said? I cannot imagine! Thus I will keep this brief. The title track is a fine listen, and ""Your Salvation"" is a lovely, albeit rather slow, melody. However, it is ""Free James Brown (So He Can Run Me Down)"" which is most dear to my heart. It will get stuck in your head, and you will love it. Therefore: buy this now. Your ears will thank you."
4,"good book, saved me money","this book is really good, i would have given it 5 stars but most pictures are for 3.8 liter and 4.6 liter cobras and i own a 5.0 liter 94 GT. they describe things well including potential problems with malfunctioning parts, which is good for diagnosis. i have saved 3 to 4 hours on labor by doing some jobs myself. i am somewhat mechchanically inclined. i have never changed my own oil (too messy and i wouldn't know how to get rid of it), but i did replace my EGR valve and sensor, my fuel pump relay, my belt, O2 sensor, spark plugs and wires. the book always tells you when you might be getting in over your head, and says, let a pro do this part. i have learned alot, and saved more."
2,Incomplete information,The manual does not cover everything. It does not even have all the wiring diagrams necessary to troubleshoot problems. I would not recommend it for this reason.
4,TRACK LISTING (FOR CRYING OUT LOUD):,1. No Limit (Damaged Goods Remix) 7:382. Lethal Compound (Harmful if Swallowed Mix) 11:083. No Limit (Spontaneous Combustion Mix) 5:27
3,1000 ways to block a punch,"This book is fantastic if you want to learn how to block a punch. Basically, almost every single attack in here is a punch. There isn't much intricate work regarding escapes, joint manipulations, throws, counters or anything like that. That to me, is a travesty, as anyone who purports to know about Tai Chi and tries to make money off a book about Tai Chi should at least explore the depth and versality of the 38 moves in the form.The later Analysis of the Fighting set has a few nice moves in there, but it's nothing you can't figure out after awhile (if it's not imminently obvious).The pics are in black and white. The fact that the ""attacker"" often wears black and Dr. Yang's pants are black (his shirt is white) makes it hard to tell what's going on in some of these pics. This is especially true when black motion arrows overlap the black clothing.It's an ok book, don't know if it was worth (the money) though.-(...)"
4,Excellent view of Applications,"This book by Dr. Yang has met my every expectation of Tai Chi being a martial art. I already attend a school in Highland Park, NJ that teaches Gu Style Tai Chi for health and self defense. I appreciate and I am very lucky to be able to experience tai chi and to know that people such as Dr. Yang have taken the time and effort to preserve and to share their ideas with the world.However, I do need to continue my practice and study of this book as some of the applications do not make sense to me as yet. Tai chi is a complex art and to understand it takes a lot of patience. I hope that my review of this book helps."
5,"Perfect size, content, and approach.","As important as money is, most of us don't have a clue about how to manage it.Most of us have the feeling we could probably know more than we do about our money, but we don't know where to find the information.Most of us don't have the kind of money that requires us to have estate planners, financial consultants, or a full time accountant. However, we do have loans, homes, impending retirement, and hopefully, a savings account.Tom Martin's book ""More Bang For Your Bucks"" plainly discusses important financial topics without going over our heads. Each chapter provides real life scenarios, charts, and comparisions to help readers make informed decisions about their money.This book is great for people at any age, but it would make a great gift for college students. I have given this book to two, so far."
3,Not made in USA,"I went with this product because ""Warner Manufacturing"" is a USA company out of MN. This is partly my fault because I assumed that a US company established in 1922 employing 50 poeple actually made something. I even went to their web page to make sure and they give no indication there that they are simply a resale point. Imagine my surprise when I found out this bench was Made in China."
1,Kindle rating only...,"...since I just purchased this book this is NOT a review of the content. But, it is to forewarn people the Kindle edition has many problems. The footnotes don't work correctly, there hyphen errors, the table of contemts links only work in some cases, etc. The book still remains readable, however and is much cheaper than the print edition, so I will be keeping it as I need it for a class. But, if you are debating which edition to get and are willing to pay the extra, go for the print."
4,Excellent Basic Easel,"I purchased this easel for a small studio space that I'm building. It delivered on time and was well packaged. The easel was in excellent condition. Assembly instructions have something to be desired, and I would certaining suggest that the company spend a little more time in this department. Once assembled, (took about 20 minutes), I was pleased that the easel was a solid piece of studio furniture. Mine is sitting on a heavy canvas tarp on carpet, and it is very stable on this rather springy surface. The easel design is nice allowing the canvas space to move in just about whatever angle you need to have a comfortable painting experience. I especially like that it lays flat so if I wanted to, I could use it as a table when sketching my work onto canvas. This is the perfect easel for the space I have it in."
3,forerunner 201 out of date,"I love the forerunner 201. I've used one for over 2 years to track my runs. I can keep track of my pace, distance, calories burned, and even keep a record of bike trips. Unfortunately, Garmin hasn't updated the device to allow me to connect this newly purchased forerunner with my 2008 computer. Their customer service department has been unable to help me with the problem and I may be forced to return this device and purchase something that is compatible with my computer."
3,Good... when it works.,"When it works, it's terrific. Problem is that it's inconsistent in picking up GPS satellite. I start my runs from the same location every time and the 201 varies in its pickup of signal even though it's the same time, same location, same weather. Some days it works without a hitch -- and on other days, it will not pick up a signal even though it had no problem the day before. It will drop the GPS in the middle of a run in inconsistent places (again, I generally run the same route), and when it finally picks it up again it can misjudge the mileage by up to a half-mile. I know it's not top-of-the-line, but I would expect a company with Garmin's reputation to provide a better product. I'm hoping the 205 does a better job."
2,Can't connect to the computer,"I have started using the 201 to track both my bike riding and walking. However, I can't get it to be recognized by the computer to use the tracking software. Garmin so far has not been able to help, another phone call to customer service is in the future. I really am satisfied with products that operate as they are advertised - I do not like to drag satisfaction out of a company."
1,GPS Signal,"Don't normally post reviews, but would like to save anyone who purchases this the time/money that I lost out on. If you live in Chicago area and run along the lake...have fun trying to connect to the GPS satellite. I purchased the 201 and it NEVER calibrated,finally gave me the message ""weak satellite signal"". A friend purchased the 301 and while it did calibrate when in the suburbs, it could not pick up a signal running on the lake as well. After reading others reviews, I don't doubt people have postitive experinces. However we both returned ours."
4,Decent Watch for Reasonable Price,"This is a great watch for stepping up your training regimen. It can sometimes be a little off in calculating pace and distance - but not that much. It has a bad rap for not holding a GPS signal, but I haven't lost a signal yet (having run over 60 miles last month with it).If your'e looking for something with uncanny accuracy, this might not be the best watch for you. (I run a set course, and the watch will record the distance in a range of 5.5 - 5.95 miles - even though I'm running the exact same route). Also, the auto pause feature can be a bit tricky as it will keep timing after you have stopped or not start right away after you start running again.Overall, though, I'm glad I've got it, and it's helping me get faster."
1,Brittle and not waterproof,I went through three of these units--one was replaced after about 3 hours on the phone with technical assistance. That one broke shortly after warantee. On a Sunday day condensation appeared beneath the screen and hours later the screen went dead. The new one suffered the the same fate after a rainy day. They're supposed to be waterproof to 10m. A third was gifted to me and now that I'm two months past warantee it won't charge. In all don't bother.
1,Only useful in Nebraska,"I was very excited when I first heard of this product. But after several workouts, I am only frustrated. The unit loses GPS signal too often, even in moderately open areas. If you live in the Northwest or workout in an urban area, forget this GPS. Your distances will never match, your pace is not accurate so why would you use this? I am very upset that such a product could ever be advertised this way. I have never been more unsatisified buying a product than I have with the Forerunner. If you live in a midwest rural area you will probably have no problems, but other than that, just stick with your stopwatch."
1,The item does not work,"I am very dissatisfied with the Forerunner 201 from Garmin. Since I turned it on the device never worked the way it supposed to. I am returning the unit to a representative in Miami to check it, meanwhile, I am very unhappy with the unit especially because I live outside the US and it is very difficult sending back the unit."
1,Terrible,"This watch never seemed to locate its location. Worst of all, after swimming in the pool, water got into it and stopped working for good. Stay away from it!!"
3,CHEAP,"I bought this unit trying to be cheap. I thought it would get me from point A to point B, but all it has is an arrow with a dot. As long as you have the arrow pointint to the dot, you'll get there. I also had to by expensive software to run the unit. If you are looking to get a GPS unit to get you places, this unit is not for you. By the time you buy the unit and the necessary software, buy to one that cost more and tells you turn for turn on how to get somewhere."
1,I can't review what I don't have.,"I would love to HAVE the product so I could write a review. I ordered this item on December 15th of last year, and as yet, all I've gotten from Amazon is form e-mails telling me that there has been a delay in shipping. If this product is anything like Amazon's service, It's so bad that it causes cancer!"
2,Get the extended warranty,"However much this device has to recommend it, it has a fatal flaw. Sweat corrodes the tiny connections through which the device recharges and downloads its data. This rot advances over some 6 months after which it becomes a paperweight.Otherwise, this is a fine runners tool, except:- it does not work under trees, period.- the free software is minimalist with no analysis whatsoever.Garmin, PLEASE fit decent connections, and put your software on sourceforge.net, where hordes of programmers will quickly add killer analysis features."
4,Accurate in the flatlands in N. Ohio,"I have had the Garmin 201 for nearly 2 months and have found it to be an excellent training aid. Most of my training takes place in the flat farmlands of Northern Ohio and I have found the distance measurements accurate in comparison to other methods of measurement (e.g. car and bike odometers). Over the course of a workout the ""average"" pace and distance seem to be spot on in the open farmland. I have observed erratic behavior of the ""current"" pace during the course of a run sometimes showing that I am running much quicker or slower than I believe is correct even though I have not perceived a change in pace. I have experienced lost signals in the county parks that line the nearby river valleys. My first 5k race on flat ground registered 3.11 miles whereas a trail half marathon (13.1 miles) in a river valley registerd about 12.5 miles."
5,A Great device for the money!,"I recenty purchased the Forerunner 201 and have been very pleased with its performace and overall ease of use. I've used it in both CA and Colordo and have yet to have any problems with getting and keeping a signal. In fact, I've used it in my car and have no problems keeping the signal even on a cloudy snowy day. Overall it has delivered on all the features it promises. I read many of the reviews prior to purchasing and was somewhat concerned about the loss of signal that some others have experienced. Needless to say I have not encountered that problem at all. I have been an avid runner for 20+ years and this is truly a remarkable product for runners of all types!Happy running!"
3,S'okay...,"Works, I guess. But who uses ""serial ports"" anymore? Didn't they go out with bellbottom pants? Able to work with a little fussing, but initially had problems because you have to push REALLY hard (really), to get the serial connector to connect to the point where it all works to upload your data to the computer. There's an intermediate insertion point where you think, ""Yes, I have it in all the way; it clicked and everything..."", but you don't. Push REALLY hard (really) and it clickes in a little further, and then the unit communicates with the computer. YMMV..."
3,OK but wrong connection.....,I had to send this back because it does not have a USB connection. Therefore it did not hook into my computer and I had to upgrade to a different watch.
4,Can't run without my Garmin!!!,I purchased the 201 for a friend who is a big time marathon runner and she can't run without it now. I purchased the 301 for myself and love it. The only difference is the heart rate monitor which I never use anyways. There are only 2 draw backs... if you are running in an area with a lot of trees the monitor will loose its satalite signal or if you run by huge grain elevators!!! The other draw back is when you are running with a group sometimes you pick up other peoples heart rates or at times it will even go back or skip ahead a 10th of a mile or so.
2,Not for everyone,"I was really excited about the features that this product has. I was training for a half-marathon, and was really looking forward to the training buddy feature. But when I tried to use it, it never found the satelite signal. We live in an area where there are lots of trees. I went down to the beach where it was a little more open, but it still wouldn't pick up a signal. No matter where I tried, there was no signal. So I wasn't even able to test it to see if it worked, or if it was what I really needed for training. I still like the idea, and maybe when we move to some place with less trees, I might try buying it again. So for anyone who lives in a wooded area, it's probably not for you. If you don't, then it's probably great."
4,Garmin is Great,"I like the Garmin 201 very much. I especially like that it is rechargeable and it tells you the time of battery life remaining. I have had it once or twice give faulty mileage (about 15% off), but it has been rare."
5,Problem with Satellites and Customer Service? Not Here!,"I trepidatiously purchased the 201 after reading some of the negative reviews on here, but I'm glad I disregarded those as ""operator error."" The two complaints I read the most were:Takes Forever to Find Satellites: Never been a problem. I set the 201 out while I'm getting my iPod, hydration gear, shades, etc. out; it's done before I'm done. I have a feeling some of the complaints are from people wearing it on their wrists while waiting for it to track or moving. Set it down, turn it on, and you'll have satellites in less than a minute. I do... every time.Customer Support (or lack of it): I contacted Garmin's customer service because I had a question about the mapping in the Training Center software (which you download for free from their site). I got a very detailed and personable response within 24 hours.I love the 201 and coupled with the MotionBased web site, it has everything you need to get detailed analysis and maps of your workouts."
4,run,"I like it as a running buddy, but they tend to only last about a year or two! The buttons will stop working there for needing replacement."
4,Pleased,"Excellent product. Gives an extremely accurate read out. The free software downloaded from garmin.com is easy to use and fun. One thing, the cable it comes with to connect to your computer has a serial port on it, we bought a serial to usb adapter (about $30) so we can plug it in to the front of our computer."
1,Replaced and works well!,"UPDATED SEE BELOW:This was a useful device but it broke within 3 months of my purchase.After 3 months the forerunner stopped working all together. Reset, upgrade firmware, and other suggested fixes do nothing.I have emailed Garmin hoping for support, more than 2 weeks have passed with nary a response.Beware there seem to be a lot of faulty/poorly constructed units out there. Going back to my timex GPS watch for now.UPDATE: Garmin contacted me and eventually replaced the unit. The replacement has worked well for many hours of running. I would now give the unit 5 stars. It is great to have all of the data from all of my runs. Plotting it on google maps is a neat feature."
5,Tested in Multiple Run,"I have now used this for 2 long runs. After reading the CNET review about possible spotty GPS signal, I was pleasantly suprised. I had no problems during the entire run, even running under trees. Training assistant feature was great. The GPS downloads into the free forerunner logbook software to keep excellent track of your daily runs. During my last run I got to talk to two others who own this device, and they too, reported excellent signal coverage."
1,Waste of money,"When I first heard about this product I was thrilled. The Forerunner promises the ability to help navigate through trails, maintaining accurate distance and speed, but it seems that if I run under 2 trees in a row I lose reception inmediately. I am in the military and I own various GPS systems so I can definetely appreciate the value of these devices. Unfortunally the Forerunner did not live up to its promises, and now Ive wasted valuable money on a bad piece of equipment."
1,Good for 18 months,"I've had one for some 18 months. It has great functions, although I didn't try the Virtual Partner - I don't believe that will work well because it loses GPS signal too often. And I jog in a park! Someone jogging around tall buildings will probably have more trouble. BUT, after some 18 months of not very intensive use (I usually jog outdoors only twice a week, since it rains a lot where I live), the unit went hayware. It started turning itself on and off repeatedly. It started in the middle of a night, waking me up with its beeps and only stopped when it ran its battery out. I emailed Garmin about this - no answer. Then I tried calling then up, but ""all our representatives are busy, expect to wait for 15 to 20 minutes"" and the international call would fall before that. Disgusted, I threw it away and plan to try some other brand. If you think that something that costs around 150 bucks should last only 18 months, go ahead."
3,cannot change latitude/longitude to MGRS,You cannot change the latitude/longitude to any other type like MGRS (etc). On the Garmin forerunner 101 you can. I was under the impression when i purchased this item that you can.
1,Doesn't work - don't believe the hype,"It just doesn't work. Simple as that. It loses satellite signal more than 50% of the time. I tried it in a residential area with a few trees in Los Angeles, and it couldn't keep the signal. I even tried running down the middle of the street - no overhead trees - and still didn't work.Interestingly, I read all the positive reviews before I bought it here. Today after I shipped it back to Amazon, I found another page with the same product that has 7 reviews compared to the over 100 here. Guess what? The 7 reviews over there are all very negative. That's my 2 cents - I really wanted it to work, but it just doesn't. In my web research it seems like the only alternative is the Timex GPS unit, but that seems to have the same problems."
2,Garmin Forerunner 201 BP Wrist - too difficult to use,"It works, the directions are OK, but it really isn't worth the effort."
3,Good but not Great,"I like this device. In theory it's very helpful-lets you know how far you've run, gives you your mile pace(with about a 30 sec delay), logs past workouts, etc, etc. However, it doesn't always work. I always begin my runs without it registering a GPS signal, after about 10 min it picks one up and inevitably loses it again at some time during the run. So, it's not entirely accurate. I live in Chicago, so I know there is a lot of obstruction and that GPS signals are very weak, but I was expecting a little more out of this device."
3,Garmin Forerunner 201 things you should know,"1) PRO: Garmin is a great company with excellent customer service. They immediately replaced my watch when the battery failed under warranty.2) PRO: The 201 has many neat features and they all work great.3) CON: You must wait for for GPS signal acquisition before you start your run, and it is slow, it takes a minute or two.3) CON: Because the positional accuracy is limited, the pace error is high, especially if you don't run in a straight line. While running around my 1/4 mile track at a steady 8 min/mile pace, with pace smoothing maximized, the 201 will indicate values ranging between a 7.5 min/mile and an 8.5 min/mile.Overall it is a cool device, just not quite accurate enough for me."
4,Satisfied with Garmin,"I'm a novice racewalker training for my first marathon in September. The Garmin Forerunner has been a great help with my short/long distances training.POSTIVES: Adjustable strap (have small wrist); easy to navigate through menu modes; backlight; LCD display easy to read for quick glance; training assistant-virtual partner, pace/speed alert,time/distance alert, history, custom page. Applied for Amazon credit card and received $30 off the price.NEGATIVE: My device charges only up to 14 hours instead of the 15 hours as stated in the manual. But 14 hours is still alot."
5,Great companion for Biking,"I bought the Garmin 201 on a whim the night before the Waves to Wine event in California Wine country. It justified itself the very next day when a turn was poorly marked by the organizers.I have been riding with it three times a weeks since then and it is a terrific gadget. Keep in mind that this is NOT a navigation tool. You cannot download maps. However it is ideal as a training aid. As mentioned elsewhere, the altitude (and therefore the gradient information) is not nearly as accurate as the X,Y coordinates but this is true for all GPS units, including factory installed navigation systems in cars.The software that comes with the unit is ok but if you really want to maximize the value, look into the topo! software on the national geographic web site. With this software, you can plan your route ahead of time and download way points into the GPS unit. Also topo! will give you a much more accurate altitude information and you can obtain a profile of your ride."
3,Needs to be perfected!,"I have had my Forerunner for over a year now. What my experience has been:1)Works better when battery is fully charged. After 2 hrs I lose signal strength to the point of the GPS not seeing part of my run.2)It is not been very accurate . However, the unit was more reliable during the first couple months of owning it.3)Do not try to use in wooded areas ,trees interfere with the signal to the satellites.4)Battery efficiency drops off very fast after the 1st 6-10 charges.Like most modern day gadgets needed to be perfected before releasing to the market."
5,Free at last!!!,"I enjoy running, but I also enjoy knowing the distance I run. I get bored running the same route. This nifty little device allows me to measure my distance and run where ever the trail takes me. I haven't used it on a business trip yet, but I can see the obvious benefits. I purchased a USB to serial adaptor for my computer (I have no clue why the good folks at Garmin don't put this out with USB instead of serial???) downloaded the updated software and it works like a charm. This thing ranks right up there with the iPod on the neat little things to improve life scale. I'm free to follow the path less traveled and yet still know how long of trail it is!!"
4,Garmin GPS,"Awesome - bought Nov 2004 and it still has the 1st mile i ever ran (11/26/04). Screen is larger and easier on the old eyes to see than the newer models. Only thing i couldn't do was get it to download into my computer. But, would buy this same model again."
2,Small problems,"Two complaints about the unit I own:First, battery life is very short. When the unit says 10-11 hours of charge left, it needs to be recharged. I can onlt get three runs in on a charge. Second, the unit sometimes freezes up when acquiring the GPS signal. There is no way to turn it off or re-set it when this happens, so you just have to let the battery drain down all the way (which doesn't take long), and recharge it. Accuracy is good, probably +/- 5%. Other products (eg. FitSense) seem more reliable."
5,"Excellent functionality, but can't download",I love this thing. I've been using it for several months have no complaints about the unit.I am having a problem transferring data to/from my toshiba laptop (garmin released a firmware update in Jan04).Garmin tech help shrugged their shoulders and said it is a toshiba problem. Anyone else having problems synching the unit with a toshiba laptop?
1,very poor purchase,This thing only works on clear days on open roads. If you plan on running on cloudy days or on paths with trees do not bother with this thing. I was very dissapointed.
1,Does not work at least not in NYC,How many workouts is one supposed to waste getting this thing to work? I stopped at around a dozen. This GPS is just not ready for primetime; at least not within urban environments ( though one would have thought that nyc's Central Park might have provided sufficient open sitelines it apparently does not.) Wish the product specs did not overhype the product so much.
2,disappointed,"After updating the software to the most current version I am still not getting accurate information. My Forerunner is losing signal when others that I run with are not. When the signal does come back the distance is way off, I mean WAY OFF, say 42 miles one time and 5 or six most times. I have talked to the tech support and will end up sending this unit back."
1,Useless device,"This device is not accurate. If you want inaccurate times and distances, go ahead and buy this. If you want to try to keep up with how fast you are running a distance, you can not depend on this device. The first day I used the device I was running on a track so I know exactly how far I went. I ran 3.5 miles. The device indicated I ran 3.83 miles. I contacted Garmin and received some suggestions, but it did not get much better. The device works better running on the road as compared to the track, but on a three to four mile run on the road, it can still be off .1 to .2, maybe more. This may be the best a GPS can do, but to me, this is not very accurate and does not give one an accurate record of time and distance. Just my viewpoint."
3,50 - 50,"When it works the watch is great. However, I live in a city and if I get a satellite signal within 5 minutes I'm lucky. The watch then constantly loses signals is inaccurate. When running on a course that has very few trees or tall buildings, the unit is excellent. So buyer beware. If you live in a city or run on a course that is wooded, the watch may not work well."
3,Good for road running; poor for trail running.,"I do like this GPS training gadget, but a warning for other buyers: it works very poorly for me on trail running in the forest, which is 80% of my running. It just couldn't catch and hold a signal. On road running it was great; I agree with all the pros listed by other reviewers. I'm going to keep it, especially for training for 5 and 10K runs; but I wish it worked in the forest; I'd love to know how far I'm really running on the trails."
4,Do yourself a favor !!,"Well I have been a runner for about 3 months now. I train in the hills located by my house and up until now what I have been doing(distance, calories, pace) has been guesswork. I looked into getting the ""geko"" 301 GPS device but my running partner showed me this unit. To tell you the truth... I couldn't be happier.I did my first run last night and the garmin 201 forerunner did great. It did all that it said it would do. I'm also excited about the software that is due to come out.Long story short, the forerunner is a great little package that gives you better data than guess work or driving around in your car to try and ""figure"" out your distance, this does that and more. I plan on using mine every time I train."
1,not working properly,"we have had trouble from the beginning with this product. i got it to train for a marathon and it has not been accurate at all. the distance and pace per mile jumps all over the place from a 6 minute pace to an 11 minute pace when i know this cannot be the case. i am an established runner, the pace differenc is not accurate. i have the original box and need to speak to someone or send it back for a replacement."
1,Disappointed,I can not express how disappointed in the poor design of this item. To charge the battery was an incredible hassle. At least Amazon made iteasy to return when we weren't happy.
4,The Garmin Forerunner 201,The 201 is an excellent tool to help with pace and distances when walking or running. Light and user friendly.
2,"Poor Perfromance, the Timex is Better","I have 4 other Garmin GPS systems, and have been running with the Timex Time+Distance system for about 6 months, so I was very excited about the Forerunner. Unfortunately, it really is unusable due to is poor satellite tracking. I run the same routes I've run with the Timex system, and the Forerunner consistently loses satellites, and that throws the whole pace and distance thing off. I'm not running in the forest either, just some parks with light to medium tree cover. I sent Garmin an e-mail about this, hoping they were planning on releasing some patch to fix it, and I got the form letter back about how GPS works (and I did already know what ephemeral data is). I do like the form factor (but I think its placement on the wrist contributes to the poor tracking), and the interface is far superior to the Timex's. But unless you run in a desert, I think this fails in its primary purpose: to give you accurate speed and distance feedback. Stick with the Timex."
1,Can't trust Amazon anymore,I am very disappointed Amazon's product service. I just got my Forerunner 201 but it is returned product (it even looks used) and AC desktop charger is missing. I don't think I can trust Amazon anymore.
4,Needs a Better Antenna,"I bought this device to help me pace my runs. It does a decent job at it when it can get the necessary signal. Unfortunately, it loses signal pretty often. I am looking at the output of the Running Log program, and it shows that I reached a running speed of 20 miles an hour at one point. Well, I can hardly get up to that speed on a bike. The error was obviously caused by the lost of signal. Because of this, the device is good but not great."
1,Very inaccurate and very bad service,"I have had the device for about seven months and I have used in about 12 runs. For all of them I got pretty inaccurate results (at least 10% off for long runs, and wildly off for short ones). Now why have I used it only 12 times in six months? Well, rather than giving up, I sent it back to repair now twice. Garmin certainly takes its time sending it back to me. I sent it last about two months ago, and I haven't got the unit back yet. If you want to talk at anyone at Garmin, good luck! Whenever I tried to call technical service, they announced that I would have to wait for at least twenty minutes on the line.Just as a comparison, my $25 pedometer has been more accurate in every single run."
5,Great little device - no problems,"I have had my Forerunner 201 for a few weeks and am very impressed. The features are perfect for anyone who monitors his/her running activity. I live in Santa Cruz, CA and the GPS reception has been very good outside. Trail and canyon running in heavy trees has not caused any problems. Inside, plan on losing the GPS signal.The device is great for monitoring hill running, distance, pace, and your running history. The screen is large and easy to read, though an angled viewing angle would have been nice since you have to cross your body to read while running. Overall, I would highly recommend the device."
2,Garmin Forerunner 201,"I bought my Forerunner about 3 months ago and have been very disappointed with it. The main problem is it's tendency to lose the satellite signal. If you intend to use this for trail runs....forget it. Even running along a road with trees next to the shoulder is enough to drop the signal. Once that happens, it tends to be wildly inaccurate. Eventually, I found that I was using it as a stopwatch with a large display.......until yesterday. I decided to mount it on the deck of my sea kayak and do a long paddle. THAT is what it's suited for. Terrific speed and distance accuracy because the sky is unobstructed.I don't know whether it is just the nature of a GPS to lose a signal with a tree canopy or that this particular model is not sensitive enough. In any case, if you intend to use it for running, think twice before plunking down your money."
4,Garmin 201 review,"Great piece of equipment. I use it to pace my basic training unit at Fort Benning while on foot marches and during runs. I recently used it on a foot march during a pretty heavy thunderstorm. Being out in the middle of nowhere with heavy cloud cover didn't seem to faze it much. A bit slower loading in its location with the satellites, but it still worked. During this march, it was soaked in water and sweat. It also got a taste of some mud when our evac. vehicle got stuck on a dirt trail. However, I wasn't able to manipulate the ""custom"" pace alarm within my specified time. It only allowed me a 10-minute gap instead of a preferred 2-or-3-minute gap. The battery provides a pretty decent charge and the settings are otherwise easy to manipulate."
4,Excellent training aid for the money.,"My wife and I bought this from Amazon because we are training for our first marathon. I really like it because I can run anywhere and know exactly how far I've run without pre-measuring the course. I run around our neighborhood of tree lined streets and I don't like to take the same way twice so this is really useful.Likes:Great ScreenThe training assistant and lap/pace alert is a super feature. I set it to beep and warn me when my pace drops below a certain speed (I'm not going to embarass myself publicly and say what that speed is!) Before the forerunner, I thought I was running a pretty fast pace - in reality I'm not as fast as I thought.Dislikes:Unable to store two separate profiles. By this I mean it can't keep separate settings for two people, such as history, pace alert, etc.Sometimes loses coverage running under trees or next to large buildings.Alarm/beep isnt loud enough.All in all, a good product and IMHO worth the price."
3,DOESNT WORK PROPERLY FOR THE $,"I am disappointed with this product. It was recommended by a friend who raved about it. I was having problems before the warranty was up. My error I still did not send it in for service. The calories & weight did not stayed stored in the custom profile. I think for the $ you spend for this watch you should have a decent product. In addition to the keeping the calories & weight stored, the screen goes blank for no reason. I know I had charged the battery prior to using!"
4,Garmin Forerunner 201,"This is the best running GPS out there in my opinion because the screen is big enough to see, unlike the 405 / 305, which have slightly better reception, but very little visibility. Unfortunately, this particular model that I purchased was not the USB model, but the serial connecting model (serial doesn't work with new computers without a USB adapter, of course). This is a mistake that can be easily made because there is no way to tell the difference unless you look at the back and see either 4 dots (serial), or a small trapezoid plug (USB) which is on the back on the newer 201 models. After purchasing an adapter it works fine with all of my computers. The ""Triumph"" HR monitor that I already had worked with it as well. Overall: Excellent product. Complaint: Be careful that you buy the 201 with the right connector."
4,hard to charge after a while,"I am absolutely addicted to my Forerunner 201. After a year or so, the contacts became worn off, so it was difficult to charge. I owned mine for almost two years and it has died completely on me. I miss it."
4,My new best friend,"The Garmin Forerunner 201 is a computer on your wrist. just read about the specs and it will tell you everything you need to know. but the only thing i dont like is that when i look at my pace, it will sometimes read 6.09/mi or 12.6/mi when im really running at about 7.30/mi. remember this is only sometimes when the signal strength is weak(running under trees for example). but, in the end i suppose it balances itself out. i still love this thing. i wouldnt trade it for anything.****"
5,Easy to Learn,"We bought this GPS for my mom- an avid walker and Volksmarcher. After a 3 minute lesson from wife (who also has one)off we went on a 10km hike. My mom is not super tech savy, but she took to it right away and liked that it showed her the time, distance, and watch time (so she didn't have to wear her watch). It was easy for her to set up her settings (weight, auto pause etc). She also remarked that it was very light and not a nuisance on her wrist. I like the security of it- the ability to back track on your route should you become disoriented.Our family will probably purchase our third one (for me) soon."
3,The goods and the bads,"Goods: Garmin has a very good customer service so if your machine breaks, it can be replaced right away. Large buttons and screen make it easy to operate and read.Bads: I have had 3 Forerunners up to now and 2 out of 3 have gone broken within a year. The problem are the buttons which stop working for some odd reason. The good part is that I have gotten new Forerunners everytime my old one breaks but won't be able to do that any more since the guarante is now over. The problem since to either be the moisture or the rain."
4,spectacular voice,"i didn't always like darwin hobbs music but after checking out his cd from library i realized i was wrong. this man has a wonderful voice and nice music to go with it. my favorites are his duet with michael mc donald and donna summers, along with some background vocals from virtue and angie winans on some of his songs. his cd is just wonderful."
3,Vandross and Hobbs,"D. Hobbs is a great singer and this CD ministers the word of God with a R&B, Hip Hop, soul feel that you will love. It's a great CD to listen to when you need to be ministered to or want to minister. D. Hobbs voice is truly anointed and can be compared only to that of Luther Vandross."
3,Bump 'n Go vehicle,This toy did not last long. The motorcyle handlebars broke so the guy couldn't stay on. Plus it's very noisy. The guy is still around but not much fun since he was designed to sit on the bike.
4,sexy,"It is indeed a shame that this little gem has gone out of print...simple, wonderful, beautiful, erotic, funny, and sexy...all aptly describe the photography. So good you'll want to buy two."
1,"Dated, posed pictures","I was really disappointed by this book after reading the reviews. The pictures are dated, too posed, not genuine looking."
5,WOW!,Thanks to the group for being true to essence of their music! I'm amazed at how well it flows; and find myself humming along to the lyrics long after the music stopped playing...that tells me Mad Season has all the ingredients to become a CLASSIC!
5,Excellent!,This is a phenomenal cd that takes you through many moods. It's the kind of CD that makes you want to change your life. Very intimate. Very personal. I can't stop listening to it.
5,fantastic,"this is a remarkable album which i think is even better than their first one. i thought it'd be hard to beat ""yourself..."" but there are actually more good songs here and it seems less melancholy though it still retains matchbox 20's characteristic appeal. bravo! buy this.. u won't regret it."
5,Absolutely love this album!,"Mad Season is the best CD I have heard in a long time! I became a fan of Matchbox Twenty the first second I heard ""Push,"" and they have only gotten better. I love the high energy songs like ""Black and White People,"" ""Last Beautiful Girl,"" and especially the title track ""Mad Season"" (which I can't seem to get out of my head!) The album also has some very powerful ballads, such as ""Rest Stop,"" ""Bed of Lies,"" and ""If You're Gone."" Rob Thomas is an absolute wonder both instrumentally and vocally. Overall, the boys don't dissapoint."
4,Takes you on a musical journey!!!,"This CD is much better than Matchbox Twenty's debut CD, ""Yourself of Someone Like You."" This CD, ""Mad Season,"" takes the listener through a musical journey of different songs. Some songs are slow, some fast, others rockin', bluesy... This, combined with Rob Thomas' one-of-a-kind voice really make listening worthwhile."
5,No Sophmore Jinx,"This album that Matchbox 20 put out is great. I liked there first album, but I got more attached to this album. On this album, the songs really hit home. The one song that really did was ""Bed Of Lies."" That song really hit home and is one of my favorite songs. Another one that I loved was ""Stop.""The Album as a whole is a great CD. If you do not have, you should go out and get it."
3,"Too much,,,, it's definately not all that.... :-(","Hello friends from rckrmike@hotmail.com.Sowwy, i'm definately not too hot on this c.d. Sure, it does seem like an awful lot of effort went into it--in fact, too much effort and not enough music. This c.d. lacks the drive and hooks of the first c.d. with the exception of the songs ""Angry, Crutch"" and one or two others, it's a huge dissappointment and is just loaded with filler material. HEY MATCHBOX, really guys,,, if i wanted all the violins and total background music going on during the songs, don't u think i'd go to the philharmonic. It's a poopie effort :-("
4,"Some great songs, not as deep as the first.","""Bent"", ""If you're gone"", and ""Leave"" all have the potential of number one songs. Some of the others I tired of early. I really didn't tire of any of the first albums songs.""Black and White People"" is another well put together song and shows Matchbox 20 has more than just a top 40 sound.All in all, a good cd and one worth buying. It is hard to meet the standards of the first CD since it was so awesome."
3,what happened?,"Yourself or someone like you was a lot better than Mad Season. When I first heard ""Bent"" on the radio I knew that their was something different. After I got the cd I knew what it was. They tried too hard. In every song they added some ridiculous new instrument. Take for instance ""Black and White people"". The horn ruined the song. Whenever I started getting into the song Rob's voice was interrupted by some out of place saxaphone solo. I mean c'mon peoples! This song was supposed to be full of angst but instead they had to give it an artificially upbeat tune. When the lyrics are about a realtionship falling apart the song is SUPPOSED to be sad, and the rest of the songs are like that too. They drowned out the real meaning of the song in distracting new instruments. Less is more."
2,"Hello, I sold out","Dear Matchbox Twenty, trying to make every song a radio single turned a fan of yours, into someone who just categorizes you in the same way as no talent boy bands. This album is one of the biggest waste of talent and one of the worst sophmore releases I have ever heard in my life. ""Real World"", ""Push"" it didn't matter what song it was, in Yourself or Someone Like You, I don't know if it was unintentional but those were well thought of songs. Mad Season pop-trash music you made. Instead of growing as an artist, you fell backwards, way backwards. I was nice and I gave you a 2, just because you are the same band that put out Yourself of Someone Like You. Boring dull --uninspiring-- That is the perfect word i'm looking for: UNINSPIRING effort. Try again!"
2,Different,"I'm not here to diss Matchbox 20 because they are very talented and I admire them. But, this cd is not that great. Their debut album is much better. This cd contains slow songs that has no catchy rhythms or beats. Usually, it takes a couple of times to listen to a cd in order to like it, but I still don't like it very much. However, this cd is not a total disappointment. It has some decent songs like, ""Angry"", ""Black And White People"", and ""Bent"". Also on this cd, the kinds of instruments they use sound different. Matchbox 20's sophomore effort is not as good, but it proves that they still have alot of talent."
5,A Slice of Rock and Pop Heaven,"OK, when Mad Season first came out, I wanted to check it out, but I was reluctant when I heard that matchbox twenty had strayed from the formula that I loved in Yourself or Someone Like You. I finally bought it and heard it all and I've concluded that I LOVE IT. While Yourself... had all the markings of a garage band album, Mad Season is more mature and enriched by the horns, strings, etc. Like Yourself... I can listen to Mad Season all the way through, without skiping over tracks. I like both the similarities and the differences in the albums. As for Rob's songwriting, he has been influenced by personal experiences, his marriage, etc, and it shows in his songwriting. Particularly good tracks are ""Black and White People,"" ""Mad Season,"" ""The Burn"" and ""Bent"". I'm glad I took a chance!"
5,A Little Different but still a great Album!,"The new Matchbox Twenty CD is truly a great musical success. For many people that liked the bands first album you will love this one. The first single of their new album Bent reminds you a little bit of ""Push"" and ""3am"" and i personally think the one lyric in the whole song that makes is ""Once was clean but now I'm jaded"" Really good I also liked ""Angry"" a really good song also their only real ballad ""Bed of Lies"" is an exceptional song and can only hope that it will make it as a single. If you liked their first album you will like this one but it is a little different it mixes with relationships alot and gives you more of a sadder view about relationships and society in general than just the angry sound from their orginal album. my suggestion Buy the album!"
4,Great rock for the soul,"After his triumphant win of 3 Grammies for his collaboration with Santana on Smooth, Rob Thomas and his bandmates come back with a brand new followup to the 10 million-selling Yourself or Someone like You. Well, don't expect any ""Smooth"" stuff here! Instead what you get is a mix of mainstream alternative rock for the 1st half and the better part comes after. The later part of the CD sees more intense emotions and soul-infused tracks. Recommended are If You're Gone, the intense 1st single Bent, the excellent & soulful Bed of Lies, Leave and the bluesy & dramatic You Won't Be Mine. Not as formulaic as you would expect from a group who last sold 10 million plus albums the last time around. Way to go!"
5,Awesome Album!,"I bought this CD after hearing ""If You're Gone"".I'd never heard of Matchbox 20 before that track. I absolutely fell in love with the whole album. Great listening!"
5,"Underrated? Oh, yes!","I think the most important thing about mad season is accessibility. Rob's lyrics are easy to relate to, whether you're in a tough relationship, getting out of one, or just complaining that your town is too boring. We've all felt like a crutch, every one of us has lamented that the object of our affection loves someone else, and I can't think of anyone that hasn't been stupid from time to time. Thankfully, the lyrics and music always escape triviality and cliche (I love the brass!). After all, I've never heard anyone talk about a 'bed of lies' but I still know what Rob means. And I'll never get the imagery of ""Crutch"" out of my head.The point of mad season is, ""Here are some songs. Hope you like them. Listen and get what you want out of them, and I'll bring you more later."" I cannot think of a better way than this.Rob, I do like the songs and I can't wait to get more."
4,Great CD!!,"Okay so this release was not as good as their first and they lose a STAR for not improving, however, the fact still remains that the CD is an excellent selection of rock tunes. Would love to see Motorplant tour with them, they would be great together! Check out Motorplant ""American Postcard"" as well."
4,Matchbox Madness,"I really enjoyed the latest CD from Matchbox 20. I bought it for ""If Your Gone"", and was quite pleased with the entire album. ""Angry"" is a good start, and then of course there is ""Mad Season"" and ""Bent"", both of which are worth your time. I really like ""Bed of Lies"" and my personal favorite (aside from maybe ""If your gone"", which I liked enough to buy the album) is ""Rest Stop"". Great song. I liked ""Yourself of Someone Like You"", but in my opinion this is the better CD."
3,Solid Comeback for m20,"This band is a guilty pleasure for those of us who call ourselves rock fans. Catchy hooks, repeating chords and pouty love songs all make matchbox twenty a boys band with an electric guitar. Yet, time and again I find myself touched by one of Rob Thomas' many apologies, or tapping out one of their beats on my desk. Could I seriously say I could resist the lyric ""So are you gonna stand there or are you gonna help me out?"" I couldn't, and so I broke down and bought it...and wasn't diappointed. Wasn't impressed either, but wasn't disappointed. Maybe that's why I, and others, keep coming back for more. They give us the soundtrack to the proverbial fights with the significant other, the bad days, and the mad seasons. And in a way that makes for just good listening. Go and buy it--you won't be disappointed."
3,It's fine but not as good..,This album is alright...but it's a little too artsy...too much lamenting and soulfulness going on here I think...there's not enough songs that have an edge to them...needless to say I was a little disappointed when I listened to this album... After listening to all the tracks once through I noticed that it all seemed to blend together...there wasn't a big hit song in the bunch... I think this band is a lot better when they crank it up a little bit further than they did on this album.
3,Not Matchbox 20,"By all regards, the new matchbox TWENTY cd 'Mad Season' is not a rehash of the wildly successful CD 'Yourself or Someone Like You', by Matchbox 20. In fact, i've listened to it a number of times over now, and all the things i loved about their first cd are not in evidence here.Nonetheless, this is a dramatic and risky step the band have taken in paving a name for themselves - rather than generating more easy-listen-rock that's radio-friendly, they've opted for a more mature, stylised album. There's a greater use (and variety) of instruments, and while the lyrics are consistently excellent, the tunes themselves will take a little getting used to.I fell in love with the no-frills, vocal/guitar sound of YOSL, and i think that's what i miss the most about Mad Season, but i'll keep playing it until i can honestly say that i like it, because i know i eventually will."
3,Mad Season is not bad,"My review may seem a little harsh after you have read it but it is true. The bottom line is the songs on mad season are decent to listen to with the best tracks being angry and bent. But the rest of the songs are just not as well done as on yourself or someone like you. Perhaps with the passage of time the songs might grow on me, but overall this cd is not as good as their first."
2,snorrrrreee....not worth the plastic,I am a pretty big fan of thier first album so I pre ordered this one. I am terribly diasappointed. This albums lacks any shred of the truth and intensity as thier first. The songs are now cluttered with studio work and backround noise. Ive heard more heartfelt songs from the backstreet boys. There is no real harmony to any of the songs.I gave it two stars because of the work the marketing team put in to book/cd case. Off to the used CD store it goes.....
5,My favorite CD of all time!!!!,"I can't go a day without listening to this CD at least once! It is absolutly the best thing out there. Although die hard YOSLY fans may be put off by the different style, It is a much better album and Rob Thomas' voice has grown wonderfuly smooth! There are so many outstanding songs on this CD, you can't pick just one favorite, but the best of the bunch are ""If You're Gone"", ""Last beautiful Girl"", ""Mad Season"", ""Bent"" and ""Bed Of Lies""."
5,mature and beautiful,"This is by far the best album of 2000.This band has so much talent! This is alot darker and more complex then ""yourself"".Every track is great!Bed of lies,Last Beautiful girl,and Mad season are some of the highlight moments of this cd.But like I said its all good!Every f!cking song!!!"
4,AMAZING!,"Matchbox 20 did it again! This is the best album i bought this summer. Its just amazing....the lyrics for most of the songs are really great and anyone with relationship problems could certainly relate to them. I loved their previous album 'Yourself Or Someone Like You"" and i have to say that this one is just as good if not better. My favourite tracks are 'If Your Gone', 'Last Beautiful Girl', 'The Burn', 'Bent', 'Bed of Lies' and 'Leave', not that the others are bad! Its just that their a bit too fast for my liking, thatz why i gave it a four star, otherwise it would have defintely scored a five on my scale! If you havent bought this album yet then ur missing out on a lot!So u better buy it now."
5,Amazing!,So much talent put into this Album.i love it!Get it! and listen to the sound carefuly and you'll fall in love with the album. soooo good!
4,"Addictive, at Best","This CD, although not as outstanding as MB20's debut ""Yourself or Someone Like You"" is the CD that really is matchbox TWENTY. The band had been together longer, and finally defined themselves and the musical path they wanted to take. It's been a while since the first single Bent came out, and a little less since If You're Gone was released, but this CD is much more of a journey than those two songs may portray. While they are probably the best songs from the CD, Last Beautiful Girl, Angry, Crutch, Stop, and Bed of Lies are amazing songs from an amazing band.The reason this CD gets only 4, is because it was way over produced. Black and White People and You Won't Be Mine are examples. These are still songs deserving of 4 stars, which on my scale is at least one star above all the rest."
4,Amazing and a half,"I love this album! Truly amazing piece of work, shows a lot of growth since their first album. Very catchy songs with a lot of meaning and depth within the words. Not quite as good as their old album, but still a must have album. My favorite tracks are ""Stop"" and ""The Burn."""
5,Just as good as the first...in a different way.,"I would like anything by matchbox20. When I first listened to this CD, I had a very hard time deciding if I liked it or hated it. The music is very different from the first album, but now that I've listened to it at least 50 times, I think I like it better. The songs are thought-provoking, the music is much more mature, and the lyrics are full of emotion. Rob Thomas gave this his all."
2,Disappointed,"Matchbox 20's last CD ""Yourself or Someone Like You"" was awesome! I loved all of the songs on the CD, so I was incredibly disappointed when I got the new Mb20 CD ""Mad Season"". I had high expectations and the only song I really enjoyed was ""Bent"". All of the other tracks were hick-ish and didn't have the familiar Mb20 flavor."
4,glad they didnt have the other cd,"i wasnt looking for this cd i was looking for 3 doors down, the better life but they didnt have it so i got this im glad i did first of all bent is a great song with a littles mexican theme to it and the rest of the cd cant possibly live up to that song except maybe crutch which is good cuz it is fast paced this is a great cd that everyone should get and when you buy it listen to crutch first and bent second ok"
2,oh well their first album was good,"Just typical. A nothing band makes it big and then their follow-up album is a hyped-up commercially-dominated one made to sell more records. They have clearly lost the style that brought them out of obscurity. They are no REAL rock tracks on this record, just manufactured songs that strive to emulate their previous success. Matchbox 20 has discovered that the pop market is bigger than rock and have acted accordingly. Oh well, they had their 15 minutes."
1,mad season,"This album gets very boring. After hearing Bent millions of times on the Radio, MTV, parties etc., this cd kinda sux. I dont recommend buying this."
1,a poor follow-thru after their 1st CD,"If you're expecting more of the riviting innovative alternative rock that you got with ""Yourself Or Someone Like You"", forget it. This collection of songs sounds like it was recorded in one afternoon and then mixed for 12 months. The result is a compilation of songs that sounds like the Partridge Family's second album. Some chalk this up to the band's ""evolution"" but it's pretty clear that little to no effort was make to produce an inspired follow-up to their debut CD. A real dissappointment from a band with so much talent."
1,AN insult to rock music,"How can people like thsi band? Besides being talentless, they have the audacity to think that they are deep, intense and artistic. All the songs sound exactly the same - desperately seeking some deep meaning that they will never find. Sickening. Some people put them on level with such bands as Everclear, Bush (who, although i dislike, are talented), Hole, Smashing Pumpkins, etc. WRONG!! where these bands have talent, substance, and something to say, MB20 has nothing. Buy a good record. Buy ANYTHING. but don't support the death of rock and roll."
1,Rob Thomas needs an axe buried in his face,"I hate this band. They were the flagship band representing what has been referred to as the ""medio-core"" movement... rock with no balls or brains (also see third eye blind, eve 6, marcy playground, etc.) It doesn't provoke you to think, feel, or do anything. plus, the lead singer is probably the one of the most annoying humans to watch or listen to on the face of this planet.by the way, that's a nice original album title, chumps. layne (a REAL musician from a REAL band) should come back from the grave and kick your asses."
1,CAN YOU HELP ME I'M BENT,I'm so scared that i'll never be anything more than an awful singer with an even worse band!
2,Very Different,"If you're a person who enjoyed ""Yourself or Someone Like You"", I wouldn't necessarly reccommend this album. Their first album was filled with many lyrical based songs that touched your emotions. The music was simple but it was lead by Thomas. In this new album, they've changed a lot. It's just not the same stuff. It's not necessarily bad, just not the Matchbox 20 that I wanted to hear based on their first album. Bottom line is this: If you liked the first album a lot, if you were really drawn to it, and you're looking for something similar, this new one isn't for you. The band style has definately changed. If you're a hard core Matchbox 20 fan, buy the cd. I'm just hoping in time that it will grow on me before I sell it, I hate to sell back a cd of a band who had such an incredible first album."
5,More Magic from Matchbox TWENTY!,"What a great CD! The guys have done it again...they've made a CD I just can't get enough of! Outstanding tracks...especially ""If You're Gone"", ""Mad Season"" and of course, ""Bent"". Way to go, Matchbox TWENTY!"
3,What Happened?,"What the heck happened? This CD is not even close to being as excellent as the first one. There are a few good songs on this CD like Last Beautiful Girl, Mad Season, The Burn, and Bent but that is about it. A thirteen song CD with 4 good songs. I am extremely disappointed in the direction the band has turned."
2,Bad...dont waste your time...,I am a pretty big fan of thier first album so I pre ordered this one. I am terribly diasappointed. This albums lacks any shred of the truth and intensity as thier first. The songs are now cluttered with studio work and backround noise. Ive heard more heartfelt songs from the backstreet boys. There is no real harmony to any of the songs.I gave it two stars because of the work the marketing team put in to book/cd case. Off to the used CD store it goes.....
4,A Little Softer. . .A Lot Better,"Although Matchbox 20's second CD, Mad Seasons, did not have the same type of harder rock music as their first release, it had the same awesome effect on its listeners. If you like softer, slower rock or a more jazzy sound this is the CD for you. As for the lyrics--if you are having problems with love this is a great CD for you, as well. This CD contains the great songs If You're Gone and Bent, which need no commentary because everyone heard them on the radio. The Last Beautiful Girl has a great slow tempo with amazing (if you can call them that) ""love-bashing"" lyrics, as well as Crutch, which has a very unique music/lyric tempo. Stop takes you back to the older sound of Matchbox 20 music with a little more harder rock, and the CD is pulled together with a semi-upbeat song called You Won't Be Mine. If you like semi-slower rock with a little jazz mixed in, you'll love Matchbox 20's Mad Seasons."
4,It's a Mad good CD,"I didn't really like their first single, ""Bent"", but I still bought the CD b/c Yourself or Someone Like You was so good. Mad Season ranks right up there, and at times is even better. ""If You're Gone"" is such a great song (though it got played out on the radio), and this CD is worth it just for ""Last Beautiful Girl"" and ""The Burn"", alone. All the songs have grown on me, with the exception of ""Angry"", but this is a definite CD you will not stop listening to."
4,Great Album,"This is a great album. I was not a big MB20 fan until my fiancée bought the CD. Since then, I keep the CD in my truck. Some of the reviews that I have read here on Amazon, compare MB20 to bands like Led Zeppelin, and say that MB20 will never be led zeppelin: Wow!!! What keen Insight!!! No band will ever be Led Zeppelin and that is just the way it is. The people who compare bands like MB20 to LEGENDS like Led Zeppelin should not be writing music reviews ANYWHERE!!!"
4,A Damn good band!,"Their first album is absolutely awesome! ""Mad Season"" is a whole new listening experience but is very exciting to the ears. Have seen Matchbox 20 twice in concert and it is definitely worth the outrageous ticket price by TicketMaster."
3,"mad season ok, a little ""bent""","Mad Season by Matchbox 20 is definitely a good album but it kind of fails in comparison to their first, Yourself or Someone Like You which had the great single ""Push"". It basically just had a better rock sound and better songs. Now, ""Bent"" is a great song too, probobly the best on the CD, but the sound stays pretty similar. Go for the first one or even better get the single of ""Bent"" which includes ""Push"" too. This might have been better off if they included ""Smooth"" with Santana. Just skip on this one or borrow someone elses first."
5,"Not a fan before, but a fan now","I'll admit I never thought I'd ever purchase a MB20 cd- I dislike the singles the radio stations play ad nauseum so much, I turn the dial every time the notes hit my ears. Then I heard ""Bent"" and I was hooked. I bought the cd, and overall, its great. Lyrically its okay but musically, its fantastic. The best song is ""Stop"" which must be heard through headphones, turned up very loud, to get the full effect. Then listen to it again."
5,exxxxcellent album,"not often when you get a cd when all songs are of great quality,blows me away. robs lyrics and song writing are in a caliber of its own, mb20 will be around awhile.if you dont have it get it."
3,Not quite right,"After waiting 4 long years for this album, I'm disappointed. Their first, YOSLY, had me feeling up, down, angry, happy. Mad Season seems so depressing, all about breakup's and one sided relationships. Rob Thomas is newly married, I'd think some songs would've more up. When I first heard ""Bent"" I had high hopes, but so far that and ""Mad Season"" itself are the highlights of this album. If I hadn't recognized Rob Thomas' distinctive voice, I'd have thought I bought the wrong CD. I'm still a huge fan and will look forward to their third attempt. Just hope it doesn't take another 4 years."
2,not much happening here,"After a tremendous first effort ""yourself or someone like you"", Mad Season was quite a disappoinment! I would have thought, given the amount of time between releases, the band would have put together a decent effort. With the exception of ""Bent"" and ""Rest Stop"" the CD is musically weak! For a band that is very talented and sounds great live, Mad Season must have been a rush job."
3,Not as good as the first!,"This is a decent CD. But overall, it is a diappointment after their first CD. I guess I was just expecting to hear more of the same stuff from the first CD, but their whole sound has changed. I like the old sound better."
2,What were they thinking?,This new offering from Matchbox 20 is nothing like their 1st album. They have definitely gone over to the dark-side of soft rock. It is way too mellow for my taste.
4,Most under-rated band,It was well worth the four year wait from yourself til mad season. Beautiful ballets on both c.d's and Rob Thomas can really bring it home with his vocals. I was kind of shocked when I heard they already have another c.d coming out in November. I hope that it was not rushed and it has such equal staying power as the first two. The most under-rated band out there today. They deserve more credit from the music industry.
4,GREAT CD!,i gave it a 4 for personal reasons but this cd is great! its waaaaaaaay better then the first! i diffenatly recommend this cd! a lot of time and effort went into this cd and believe me it shows!
4,Rob Thomas growls and purrs like a bobcat,"I first listened to Matchbox Twenty when they released the previous album, and I am not disappointed at all when I decided to get ""Mad Season"". I find it refreshing that the songs tried to capture a wider range of male emotion. For example, the insecurity in a relationship in ""If you're gone"". Honest, without being weak. At times, Rob Thomas can growl, but at other times, his voice is purring the words (""Leave""). The album has a good combination of rough angry tunes (but still headphone-friendly!), and sensitive soft songs without being soppy. There's a surprise at the end as well, after ""You won't be mine""!Matchbox 20 is sure a group to watch!"
5,Mad Season by Matchbox Twenty,"It has been a long time since I bought a cd that was worth listening all the way through, every time. This one is a real treat. There is alot of variety in the songs, slow, fast, and everything else. Just a good, straight up collection of rock. It is hard to pick a favourite song, but ""Last Beautiful Girl"" is very good, as is ""Mad Season"", ""Bent"" and ""If Your Gone""."
3,Disappointed. =(,"After waiting FOREVER for this album to finally be released, I have to say that I found the album to be pretty average. I guess I just expected more or something. When I first got it home and popped it into the player I was very satisfied with the first song, I thought to myself - ""It was well worth the wait! ""...but then it slowly went downhill from there and I really don't care for the first single off the album much either. The lyrics are pretty good and so is the music but the sound I've come to expect from the group just wasn't there. Neither was the twangy agony felt in the voice of the first album. Maybe it'll just take some time to get use to and then I'll feel the same as the people that rated it 5 stars...hope so."
3,Overplayed,"Sure, I like Matchbox 20 but two of their songs are way overplayed on the radio! (""If You're Gone"" and ""Bent"") I would have liked this CD much, much better if I didn't hear it all the time!"
1,Music for soccer moms,"Faceless, boring, nauseating, ridiculously commercial. All aptly describe this band's 2nd offering. And as if Matchbox 20 wasn't a bland enough name for a group, ""Matchbox Twenty"" is even worse.This is the kind of music that drivers of sport utility vehicles might listen to on the way to their corporate, suit-and-tie jobs because they find it ""rocking"" and ""alternative"". The song ""Bent"" serves as a perfect example of what this album is about. Its about as middle-of-the-road as you can get. Rob Thomas isn't ""broken"" or ""depressed"", he's just a little ""bent"" and he needs some nice caring lady to show him a little love. In the land of Matchbox 20, feeling ""bent"" is probably as bad as things ever get.By the way, they also released a limited edition paper-sleeve version of this album in a stap for a little credibility, so you could also look for that if this is the kind of music you like."
1,Go Ad Fontes (back to the sources),"Matchbox Twenty's Yourself or Someone Like You was quite possibly one of the best albums ever. Many great hits such as ""Push"", ""3a.m."", and ""Real World"" were greatly accepted by the radio. Other songs on the album, while not so popular, also caught the appeal of Matchbox Twenty lovers. The imagery and creative thought provoking lyrics were incredible as well as the new sound that they were played in. Things were going great for Matchbox Twenty untill they decided to change their style and go with more of a pop sound. This is where they released their sell-out album Mad Season. A few of the songs on this album were similar to the previous sound but the overall effect of the CD was not nearly as capturing as Yourself or Someone like You. I would not reccomend this to anyone who enjoyed the sound of the preceeding album. I would hope that Matchbox Twenty realizes their mistake in this new sound and goes ad fontes or back to the sources with their next album"
2,Not as great as the other one's,"When I herd ""mad season"" I said to myself ""this is machbox 20? "" becuse it was slow music not the speed as like the one before! ""I did't like it"""
2,I Don't Buy the New Forced Sound of Matchbox20,"Yourself.. or someone like you was a wonderful album. So effortless, so glorious. The sound was pure. Matchbox 20 in thier new attempt, Mad Season, tried a little too hard to make this album a winner, and it shows in the music.Possibly afraid of falling victim to the sophomore jinx, you can tell Matchbox 20 tried their damndest on this album. Unfortunately it didn't work. This album is dull, boring, and lacks the luster of their previous work. The sound is forced, and very unnatural sounding.If you can bare listening to this album all the way through in its entirety without drifting off to greet Mr. Sandman, you are the clear winner in all of this.Message to Matchbox.. don't force it."
2,Disappointed,"If you are expecting this CD to be anything like the first, then don't buy it, because its not even close. I too, had been waiting (and waiting) for their next CD to come out, and I am so disappointed, I wish the music style was like the last. But this one is bluesy, with all these instruments and background vocals that ruin the songs. Don't get me wrong, some songs are good, but the bottom line is that after 4 years (? ) you would think this CD would be way better! Come on Matchbox 20 you can do so much better than this!"
2,For a few songs,Basically got this CD because of one song but found several others worthwihle. Besides several of these guys are from my hometown area.
4,MB 20 Grows With Me,"Matchbox 20 seems to be growing as I do. When ""Yourself or Someone Like You"" came out, a lot of the songs just seemed to be written just for me, how I was feeling, what I was thinking. I would listen to ""Real World,"" ""Long Day,"" and ""3 AM"" on repeat. Those were my songs.I originally bought this album because I'd heard ""If You're Gone"" on the radio. Fortunately, the radio station didn't over play it before I got the CD. I listened and 'discovered' ""Mad Season.""As I grow as a person, Matchbox 20's music seems to grow with me. This is awesome music."
2,What is This?,"I was a huge Matchbox 20 fan even though I am not a fan of genre. But this CD is just too much of a change. Only one song sounds like the old. There is one good song in ""rest stop"" But they hardly even rock on here. This is a boring cd. I hope they do better next time"
2,1st Impression,"After the first listening of matchbox twenty's new album, I must say that I'm disappointed. I was aware of the fact that the band had gone a different direction from their debut album, Yourself or Someone Like You, but Mad Season sounds like a completely different band. The horns and twangy riffs give the album a jazzy feel. The only similarities between Yourself or Someone Like You and Mad Season are Rob Thomas' voice and the song ""Bent"". If you are looking for an extension of matchbox twenty's debut album, save your money. If you're up for something different and have an open mind about matchbox twenty's music, grab it today. Note: will review again after several listening's"
5,Amazing CD!,"I got this Cd when it first came out and I still haven't gotten tired of it. That alone tells you how good this Cd is. Mad Season mixes pop, rock, and even a few horns into one awesome Cd. Every single song on this Cd is good. Some of the songs that stand out in my mind are Crutch, Mad Season(the best song, in my opinion, on the Cd), Rest Stop, Bed of Lies, Leave, and Stop. Next time you're in the record store go buy this Cd cause it's worth it."
5,Keep Listening,"I bought this CD after hearing it in my sister in law's car. I knew ""Bent"" was a good track, but I realized the whole album had a good beat. After I bought it I was a bit disappointed-none of the songs seemed to stand out. It wasn't until I had been listening for awhile, though, that I realized it was because the album was ALL great. I was listening one day when the song ""Bed of Lies"" just struck me...then ""Last Beautiful Girl"" and later ""Leave"" (this one still blows me away). This album defines sleeper. Its quality creeps up on you and you really have to know it to appreciate how good it is. I have had my copy for months now, and I still listen to it several times a day. this is one of those albums that won't be listened to and then left to gather dust on the shelf for 10 years. It is just good."
4,"it is okay but,",it is okay and cool but there 1st cd (yourself or someone like u )was better.if u r a mb 20 fan buy this cd
5,A thought-provoking musical analysis of the Bible,"The Residents have brought us many treats over the years, which we've greedily devoured, but this piece is both musically satisfying and socially significant. It's a look at the darker parts of the holy Bible (like Lot's escape from Sodom and what happened after and the numerous naughties of King David). Though critical, the album's purpose (according to the liner notes) is ""to neither vilify nor sanctify the book, but to allow it to be humanized."" Excusing the split infinitive in that quote, the album is thoroughly poetic and thought-provoking. Wormwood is also a good introduction for the uninitiated Residents fan. An overall great album!"
4,Reidents resurrected,"The Residents' musical output has suffered in the last ten years, and this latest offering brings them halfway back to where they once were. Those who are fans of their great 70's and 80's recordings might want to come back with this CD, though it sure ain't no ""Duck Stab"".The textual content isn't for everyone (note the easily-offended one-star reviewer below), with lots of blatant references to human anatomy, but if you can get past that, you'll be OK.Despite the dark content, this is probably the most musically accessible Residents album, with songs like ""God's Magic Finger"", ""How To Get a Head"" and ""Burn Baby Burn"" having a genuinely catchy pop flavor to them, if you can believe it from these guys."
3,The Residents Needed More,"This album provides you with an all Residential view of the bible, some of the story are twisted to their point-of-view, but others do totally follow logic, like ""Judas Saves."" The music is techno-era, and other than the voice of Lot and a couple of others, the vocals are good too, but this in noway compares to older, better Rez albums."
2,lacks the vitality of their early work,"Interesting idea for an album, i.e to show that the Bible isn't all love and sweetness, but that there is a huge amount of cruelty and evil and darkness in it too. The songs aren't particularly memorable though, and the silly voice thing doesn't really work with such 'serious' subject matter. The music sounds like it was written for a computer game. There are some nice instrumental tunes but they don't redeem the album. Check out their early stuff for some real wacky music, especially commercial album. Thank you"
5,Great Toy!!!,"My wife and I took our daughter to the Seattle zoo for her 5th birthday this year. There was a real Peacock walking about the zoo area's. She was so into this Peacock that when we told her at the gift shop to pick out anything she wanted she picked a stuffed Peacock toy. Well a day or two later during the trip (not sure when) the Peacock went missing breaking her heart. I have been searching since January to find a close match and I did with Mr. Perry. I am currently in Afghanistan and Perry is here with me awaiting both of our returns in July. I can not wait to give it to her. Thank you for providing a great toy at a great price. Sincerely, a happy father..."
5,Peacock toy.,So i got this as a gift and it is just as cute in person. it looks great and the colors are wonderful.
5,Good Toy!,"I bought two of these toys, one for my niece and my girlfriend, who likes peacocks, and both loved it."
3,Toy itself is fine. Seems durable.,"I think the price should be cheaper on this item since it really isnt very big. Although, I guess it is kind of unique. I bought it for my young daughter, and she really doesnt play with it much. It does seem durable and well made though."
4,Older may not be better but it sure is different.,"I am not a baker but my wife is and she asked me to write this review for her. When she first saw this book she really didn't want to purchase it. She figured that most recipes would be in newer books and they would have better (read newer) photos and techniques that would suit better for what she wanted to do. On a whim she got it and was quite pleasantly surprised. There are many ideas inside that she had never seen or heard about before, both in techniques and cake ideas, recipes and decorating. Most are made by methods before cake molds and forms came along. Well anyway she was quite happy and you might also find a few gems inside. There are some repeating recipes and cakes that continually show up but you might be surprised like she was. Hope this helps some."
5,School Book,I originally got this book because it was a requirement but it turned out to be a very interesting personal read.
4,convenient,"Harrison's for handspring is great. I'm a medical student and this product helps me on the wards on a daily (hourly) basis. It's more concise than the real Harrison's (thank god), but still contains all the essentials: differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, management, treatment... It is easy to use, and you can search for an explicit topic or pursue a more general signs/symptoms route. The springboard module is great because it doesn't take-up any memory. I'm currently in my first rotation and I've already impressed my attending and resident with a few gems...."
3,"Pretty Good, but misses the mark","I am a second year medical student and with the purchase of my new visor I couldn't wait to get my new harrison springboard module. Alas, it was [amt] which is pretty stiff and not much in the way of reviews to really know if it would be worth my student loan money. So here are the goods for all those who just can't decide to blow the [amt] or not. The good is that it has a pretty cool search, with spell checker. It is well organized and good for looking up differentials and giving you some tidbits. Unfortunately, it is totally a companion manuel, aka it really lacks alot of info and you are going to have to look up stuff in the real book to find out anything. It is a pretty nice module but just not worth [amt] in my eyes. If it was half that I would highly recommend it. I actually think the washington manuel is a better module as it has more information on treatment."
2,"Wonderful when new, but lack durability","I loved these when I first got them. They were incredibly comfortable.But after 2 months of wear, the insoles were completely worn out. I emailed the Acorn company (could not find a phone number) to find out if I could get replacement insoles, but they have not responded to my email.So, I would rate their customer service 0 stars. For the price, I would have expected better durability and customer service."
5,They are great!!,I love these slippers. I love in New England and they are very durable. I have a red pair and a black pair. ican wear them to bring the kids to school and to the grocery if I wanted to. Great value and comfortable.
5,What a bargain!,I bought two of these for some friends that live on the MO. river. Very good quality for the money.
2,Poor Quality,"These bandages are poor quality. May be ok for one-time use, but I wanted to use them to wrap my lower legs. I am diabetic. They tear easily and have poor elasticity when stretched unless they are stretched very little. Half had tears just from the clips that came with them."
3,Serviceable and supportive,I found these bandages to be quite effective. Although if you need to wrap you ankle you will need to wear socks on top to keep the bandage from fraying.
1,A show of support,"You definitely won't get any from this item. I started to wrap one of these bandages on my leg and my finger went right through the bandage!! The edges started to fray as soon as I tightened the bandage. I tried more than more thinking maybe it was just one bad one in the bunch, but no luck.Don't waste your money on these."
2,Somewhat decent,"I wanted to get some sports type shorts, but for me, they were a bit too short. The material is also thinner than most good quality shorts so if you're looking for longer lasting materials, this wouldn't be the best pick. I now use these shorts for swimming in and they're fine. I don't wear them to work out in though."
2,"a little bit transparent, don't wear dark underwear....","quality is fine, light weight, but transparent! Don't wear underwear in dark colors! That'll make you embarrassed in gym! The color is also too light, not like pink, but white."
4,OK...Alot better then Eggo's,"Great, low-priced waffle Iron. I only bough becuase i need $10 for free Super Saver Shipping, but it was worth the $20. It takes about 3-4 minutes per waffle. IF only it ould make them a little crispier on the outside..."
2,Goofy Waffle Maker,"I had purchased this on price alone and while it provided many years of trouble free service, the waffles it produces are not the Belgian style that most people are used to. Even with a variety of batters it didn't produce a pleasing waffle. Spend a few extra dollars and get yourself a proper waffle maker."
2,Not really a waffle iron,"Admittedly this is a pretty inexpensive machine. Trouble is that the waffles it makes just really aren't.....waffles. I think that this machine is pretty much destined to stay in the cupboard. If you are chasing the taste of real waffles buy a real iron, or go to IHOP."
5,Great guide for living with diabetes.,I purchased this book immediately after being diagnosed. It is a comprehensive guide and covers everything that the doctor does not have time to tell you in an office visit.
5,best book about diabetes i have read,"realy original, creative, helpful ideas. Open this book toany page,and you'll find at least three or four tempting newideas for living well with your diabetes,,"
5,Pure Fun,"Although this book is recommeneded for younger children, my 5-years-old son really enjoys it. Simple and fun from beginning to end. When you think a mischievous piglet has learned his lesson, you better watch out. If you are not great at story-telling and still want to read with your child, this book is for you."
5,High quality low price,"The knife came very sharp out of the box. It was washed by accident, a month later no rusting or issues of any sort. best 28$ I ever spent."
4,Are they making these out of different metal than previously?,"I bought this to replace the same exact one that I received as a gift and used for five years before losing it. It's a great knife and an incredible value. The blade stays sharp, the mechanism never gets gritty or sticky. Though...I used this purchase, the replacement, for only a week or two before it started getting rust-like spots on the blade. This never happened with the original that I owned. It makes me wonder if they started using slightly different metal or something."
3,OK,"This was not the version I had hoped to find, although there's nothing wrong with it other than that. The style of art in the pictures isn't one that I'm particularly fond of, either. Still, it was nice to travel down ""memory lane"" with the lyrics and music."
1,"Region 4, not 2","The title and description of this DVD said it was Region 2, but instead I got a PAL region 4.I'm not happy at all as this was for a European friend."
3,Better to listen than view,"Mike is not an inspiring stage personna, the gig is lacking of spontaneity, audience vitality is minimal and on top the irony Havana being the backdrop of this beautifully filmed and recorded evening. One would expect a lot more from the native musicians and dancers, again, sorry to disappoint."
1,Poor quality of Freshwater cultured peral bracelet,"I only wore a couple of times, and it broke yesterday, I don't know how can I get it fixed. There is no warranty card or vendor information to contact"
3,Birdhouse book,These are more for an experienced wood worker than i am. I wanted some more simple plans than this. OK if you have experience.
1,Utter rubbish,"I think I wrote fiction with better pacing, a more coherent storyline, and stronger grammar when I was in primary school. The multiple errors in spelling in the book description should clue you in that this is just cheap junk, but if it didn't, a couple of pages of the turgid, disjointed prose should clue you in that there is a reason you shouldn't read this book, and it's got nothing to do with ancient South American Aztec curses or whatever.Avoid."
3,BJC-55 printer comment,BJC 55 Printer Used - I've started using it just few days ago and I find excellent to be a portable printer.
3,"Doesn't do the Maestro justice, but still beautiful.","What's good about this DVD: Adorable Jose, gorgeous scenery of Rome, the interview w/Jose, and the beautiful Japanese song he sings.(You don't have to understand it to thrill to it!)What's not good about this DVD: the music usually isn't in sync w/his mouth, (the technician's fault) & they add an over-powering rock beat to the maestro's voice in many of the songs. (An untrained voice sometimes needs this to distract from the poor sound quality with which it sings, but Carreras certainly does not need - or benefit from - this beat.)What's weird about this DVD: It was made by germans, but our star does't sing one song in that language!Conclusion: If you adore Jose Carreras as I do, you'll probably want this, along with every other piece of work the man's ever done; but, buy everything else first, then this."
2,Not really worth it.,"It is not rocket science to figure out how this item is meant to be put together, it is however difficult to get those hard plastic pipes to bend in the way that is needed for it just fit and a whole other matter keeping it together.FOr the short time it was together the kids had some fun with it but it mostly lay around the edge of the pool in pieces and ended up broken after the kids used the tubes as swords and light sabers.I would not recommend it at all."
5,Get Inspired -- Do Some Good,"Coplin's ""How You Can Help"" is an inspiration to both aspiring and life-long do-gooders alike. His easy-to-follow tips and guidelines for being a successful volunteer, donor and/or professional do-gooder make this book a must-read. ""How You Can Help"" crosses all boundaries, as it applies to anyone from parents looking to develop a neighborhood tutoring program to business-owners looking to make their companies more socially responsible. Coplin's tales of success provide inspiration for all. This book sets the standard for do-gooding and motivates each reader to do his or her part to make the world a better place."
2,At least I didn't have to buy it,"Admittedly, the book may have its merits for those truly dedicated to volunteering (though I think most of it simply states the obvious). However, I am irritated by its mandated role in the introductory public affairs classes, particularly PAF 101 in Syracuse Project Advance. The only time it is required is when there is an irrelevant question on the general assignment that demands a quotation from it. There are a few lying around in my teacher's room that we grab to fulfill this task - one performs admirably as a doorstop. The use of this book in the curriculum is simply a grab for more book sales by Prof. Coplin - he wrote the main textbook as well."
1,Cracked 1st time,"I got this piece and couldn't wait to try it out. In the oven it went at 325 degrees and BOOM, crack. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I would return it, but it is a broken dangerous mess."
3,Chicago Industrial Classic Single,"Harold Sandoz Alien Dog Star (Al Jourgensen) - guitar, keyboards Tennessee King Biff (William Rieflin) ""Gallopin'"" Scorpiosaddlebutt (Chris Connelly) - vocalsChicago industrial meets Cabaret Voltare.First track is a great dance track, nice slide guitar. Kind of goth, but a bit more upbeat than most goth stuff. Second song is the Cabarat Voltaire remix, very robotic.Ahhh, good old Wax Trax."
3,"Acid Horse - No Name, No Slogan","Pity the collaboration of Ministry and Cabaret Voltaire yielded only one song, but what a great song it is! I prefer the Hypo Luxa / Hermes Pan version the most as I feel it is the best length, the other one just goes on a bit long for my taste. Not much else I can say for a two track CD, but this is a nice slice of industrial fun."
5,LOVED IT,"HEARD A PIECE OF HIS WORK ON A CLASSICAL MUSIC STATION AND DECIDED TO TRY A CD-GLAD I DID, IT WAS VERY ENJOYABLE. AS A SCULPTOR I FOUND IT VERY INSPIRATIONAL."
4,Good Preamp (Cello),"I use this preamp to connect my cello pickup and whatever output I want. It is great. Because the signal from my pickup was very low I had to adjust the preamp's sensitivity, which worked great. The bass and treble controls are great, it has good battery life, and is a a very solid thing. I don't have to worry about dropping it. My only complaints are that it is a bit chunky and expensive. I have no idea how complex this thing has to be inside, but for something that is so simple on the outside, and performs such a simple function, the price is too high, and the product is too big and chunky. But hey, it works well."
1,Not much boosting,"The perfect location for the transducer of my instrument yields low volume. Therefore I need a preamp that will boost the signal to match the loudness of my other instruments. This preamp didn't make much difference even when the input pot (on the back of the unit) was all the way to the max. If the job of this device is to merely match impedance, then maybe it's doing its job. I don't know. But if the job of this device is to boost the signal of the transducer, then it should offer a max volume setting that is too loud and we could choose a setting in between that suits us best. But at best it gives a slightly noticeable increase in volume.This is not a strong amplifier. It is merely a 2-band EQ with a slight loudness increase. It did not do the job for me, so I am giving it the minimum rating."
4,A Sudden Good Book,Anne Perry is a wonderful writer. She draws out the personalities---warts and all---for each ofher characters and this series keeps you coming back for more---thank goodness she wrotea lot of books in this series!
3,Great mystery series - OVERPRICED for KINDLE,"I really enjoy Anne Perry's mysteries, but can not figure out how they come up with the pricing for the Kindle versions. I just got the first three William Monk novels for $15.99 as a bundle, and now each one is $11.99? While the paperbacks are available used for $2.95? Time to put the Kindle down for awhile and go back to paper."
1,Excellent series - OVERPRICED KINDLE BOOK!!!,"Two of the books in the William Monk series are $7.99.Others are $11.99 (like this one), $12.99 and even $13.99.For this book, paperback is 2.95, hardcover is 8.00. 11.99 for a Kindle book is insane!!!RANDOM HOUSE NEEDS TO GET REAL AND PRICE BOOKS REASONABLY AND CONSISTENTLY. The books in this series are all relatively the same # of pages (relatively, not precisely).Therefore prices for every book in the series should be closer to $7.99. I could see 8.99 or maybe 9.99 for the thicker books."
4,Insight into a foriegn culture,"For an outsider, this book provides remarkable insight into a foriegn culture that most Americans know little about. The indelible differences between cultures are exposed in this remarkable novel. Although missing some key elements, this is very close to a Japanese Romeo and Juliet type story. Mishima, ever the historian, also digresses at several points to devulge in some eastern history and philosophy."
5,Beauty and Sadness,"A work of utter splendor, Spring Snow is the first installment of Yukio Mishima's magnificent tetralogy.I read the 4 books as in a trance in the fleeting light of a long gone summer. And like Mishima, finishing the Sea of Fertility made me feel as if it were the end of the world.Shatteringly beautiful, lined with infinite grace, agonizingly moving, Mishima's last work is perhaps the crowning achievement of 20th century world literature."
1,Boring and maudlin,"Maybe it was a bad transalation. Maybe I could not relate as a westerner to an old Japanese story, but I really did not enjoy this book. It was maudlin and unbelievable. Story was boring. Character development was terrible and it was poorly written/transalated. I recommend Murakami's Norwegian Wood for those who want to read books by Japanese authors."
5,"Astounding, if distrurbing, story of a spiritual journey.","Briefly, the Sea of Fertility tetrology has much in common with Dostoevsky. Mishima's characters act within the tight confines of aristoocratic Japan in the early to mid 20th Century. However, the real story underneath the cultural one involves a brilliant and sustained discussion of the Budhist conceptions of samsara, karma and reincarnation. Mishima's investigation of this subject covers Hindu, ancient Greek, 19th Century German and countless schools of Budhism."
2,CD not as described,Product described as new. It was used and the case was cracked and the front was not attached. Not too happy about how this was described. The CD worked tho...
3,no so good,"I really enjoyed The Oak Ridge Boys Christmas Album from a few years ago, but this one just did not measure up. I bought it for my mom as a Christmas present and she agrees with me"
5,MY SECOND OF THESE GOT A GBA AND A SP SEE NOTES,"THIS IS MY SECOND ONE OF THESE I HAVE THE SP AND THE GBAI FOUND BOTH TO BE QUALITY BUT I WAS SHIPPED THE WRONG COLOR AND KIT IN MY SP SHIPPING.THE PRODUCT IS GREAT ON EITHER CASE/ACCESSORIES HOWEVER, BEWARE THERE ARE NUMEROUS KITS OUT THERE BY INTEC AND MY SHIPPER (NOT AMAZON OR GAMESPOT) GOT MY ORDER MESSED UP I NOT ONLY WAITED WEEKS FOR WHAT I PAID FOR FAST SHIPPING RATES BUT I GOT A BLUE AND NEEDED A SILVER COLOR. AND WITH THE BIRTHDAY NOW SO CLOSE TO XMAS I HAD NO CHOSE BUT TO KEEP IT. THEY DID NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL NOR PHONE. TOO BUSY.... TOO BUSY I AM NOT SURE IF I CAN STATE THE COMPANY JUST BEWARE OF SELLERS ON AMAZON I WOULD PAY MORE TO GET THE RIGHT ONE.. BUT THEY HAD GOOD FEEDBACK AT THAT TIME (NOT SO NOW I SEE).BUT THE PRODUCT IS GREAT!"
2,Case is great.,"This was my son's purchase. The case is great, but almost everything else is cheaply made."
2,Not worth the price,"This kit includes a headphone accessory, but the Game Boy Advance does not have an ear phone jack, which is misleading. Seems like they're trying to justify the high price of this unit with additional items.This kit is worth about $20, but definitely not $40."
3,Run-of-the-mill wall wart,"Yes it works fine but is nothing special: a plain jane, run-of-the-mill, light duty wall wart. I figured since it was branded as Fishman pro audio gear it would be ultra heavy duty with rubber bumpers and thick cables. Nope, the power cable is basically a wimpy thread and looks to short out easily if you snag it with your foot while on stage. This wall wart has nuttin' on the Rat Shack or other generic wall wart brands. Just make sure you buy a generic with the correction tip/sleeve polarity and voltage."
4,Why is it not included?,"Necessary a/c adapter for outboard preamp, why does it have to be bought separately, Fishman should include it with purchase of preamp."
1,Awful Movie and Video To Boot,"Everybody knows that this MAY be even worse than ""Plan 9"" or ""Manos The Hands Of Fate"" and it is. The only problem with this Alpha Video release is that the source print is the worst I have EVER seen. I cannot believe a better print was not available. Avoid this and go with the DVD from Image."
4,Feel Ed Woods touch,"The presence of the master can be felt behind the scenes of this grade Z classic. Although Ed is not mentioned in any of the credits, it is widely acknowledged that he helped first timer Anthony Cardoza pull this one off. The film bears Woods influence by use of some of his stock players and his impossible to duplicate editing style. If you enjoy Plan 9 or any other 'so bad its good' films, get this one quick."
3,This is a blast!,"And not just the nuclear kind, either. As several reviewers above did, I saw this as part of the 50 Horror Classics collection, as well as on MST3K. This is such a hysterical film, it's hard to know where to start. The narration is incredible, the situations have to be seen to be believed (particularly the chase after the innocent father on top of the plateau, which the narrator seems to think is appropriate), and Tor as the Beast is a real hoot, groaning loudly and wielding a big stick.But for all that, I still think it's a lot of fun in a surreal sort of way. Plunk down your $6.98 and enjoy!!"
1,Bevare!,"Cool title, Tor, looks like a winner, right? Don't be fooled. I love Robot Monster, etc., and truly believe that Ed Wood Jr. is a far superior filmmaker to Lucas, Speilberg, et al., but even for a fan of this kind of thing, this one is excruciating. By all means buy it for the cover so friends will think you're outre hip or whatever, but do not actually watch it or you will hate yourself."
5,So what's the deal with the freakin' rabbit?,"This is a 54 minute movie. I mean, that's about how long it took to make. This movie is so bad (""HOW BAD IS IT?"") to refer it to Ed Wood is an insult to Ed. It's that bad. It is also hilarious. One of my fellow reviewers said to imagine it had been made by a 10 yr old. I don't think he's giving 10 yr olds enough credit.I collect Ed Wood and various other really awful movies. This is without doubt the worst made of the entire bunch! In fact, I believe deep in my cold, cold heart, this is THE worst movie ever made. There are so many obvious mistakes that it is unsporting to even try pointing them out. The movie is a total hoot and well worth showing to a bunch of friends.However, if you have even a hint of compassion you might consider getting them thoroughly drunk first. And even then I doubt any of them could figure out what the deal was with the rabbit!"
1,No-Budget Cinema,"The theatrical trailer proclaims that this 1961 schlock-fest was ""filmed ENTIRELY on location in Yucca Flats!"" How's that for an endorsement? Actually, the trailer is far superior to this dreary attempt at Z-grade science-fiction, with no synchronized dialogue but more voiceover narration than any movie in history. ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" does not belong in the ""so bad it's funny"" category - it's just plain bad. Recommended only to fans of Tor Johnson."
1,One of the worst ever,"This movie is so terrible it has a certain kind of charm. The entire soundtrack was either lost or never recorded so the whole thing is either narrated or voices are dubbed onto characters when their backs are to the camera (most shots of characters speaking appear to have been excised to hide the lost soundtrack so the editing is often choppy). Tor Johnson gives his most incompetent ever performance as ""the beast"" (an atomic blast has turned him into a lumbering killer). Several of his takes are obviously messed up - he has great difficulty getting out of an aeroplane for example - but the filmmmakers couldn't afford any re-takes. He lumbers through the desert at about 1mph waving a stick at everyone. A wrestling match he has with the police must be seen to be disbelieved. Amazing. Appears to have been cobbled together from half-of-a-finished-film."
2,Yuck of Beastly Fat!,"Nobody's expecting great cinema here, but plenty of other 50s sci-fis had no stars, no budget, no story, no script, no FX, no dialog, no sound track (all overdubbed) and of course no talent and still came up with hilariously entertaining moments or even memorable movies on occasion. Alas, not even Mighty Tor Johnson can save this glop! Commits the worst sin a ""B"" movie can... it's BO-O-ORING!Did MST3K do this movie? If so get their version."
3,"Dreadful, but . . . get the 50-Pack","Terrible acting, production, but the final scene of the ""dead"" Tor-monster (or, mons-Tor?) waking up to affectionately nuzzle a desert jackrabbit who wandered into the frame is one of the great, irrational moments in film making! It took editorial courage to leave it in--but then again, anyone who would do a low-budget rip-off (or is it a ""tribute""?) to the crop-duster scene in North by Northwest (which had only recently come out) has moxie to spare! The film is available as part of one of those 50 horror film box-sets, and is certainly worth watching if you pick it up in that format."
1,I simply could not get thru it,"This is yet another film that is so bad that you can't even enjoy it for camp value. It is just plain stupid, without humor, without acting, without a speck of plot beyond the crudest formula. Scientist gets exposed to radiation. Becomes killer zombie thingie. I did not watch what happened, though I did sit thru several poorly acted murders.Not recommended. There are infinitely better films you can get for the same price. If this film has the reputation of being one of the worst ever made, I am not surprised."
1,Dangerous side effects,"My doctor gave me Thorne Profusia-SR to improve my circulation and, though I felt good for about two hours after taking Profusia-SR, it began a series of scary nighttime heart and breathing episodes that nearly had me in the ER! My pulse and O2 saturation were jumping all over the place. I had many palpitations and felt more weak and tired than ever! Then when I stopped the Profusia-SR, the symptoms continued for another couple of nights. I will never take it again!! People with any prior heart issues beware!!"
4,A Genius book which they should make another...,Tokyoscope:The Japanese Cult film Companion is a great book if you want to know about the 5 [now 4] banned films and disaster films. I was shocked about the Pink and Violent section [Recommned for 18 and up]. I just wish they include the Toho disaster flick Conflagration which was an inspiration to a story I wrote at school. In Conclusion this book was great.P.S. Pat Macias PLEASE WRITE A BOOK ON JAPANESE DISASTER FILMS SOON!!!!!!!!!
4,A fast read - wonderful characters.,"The characters are the strongest aspect of this novel. I couldn't help caring about each and every one of them. Although the story is warm, heartfelt and interesting in regard to small town life its not necessarily profound. If your seeking entertainment without feeling you've wasted your time when the final page is turned, Plainsong will deliver."
2,yawn,"What is up with ""no quotation marks"". Is this guy too cool to use the symbols for our English language. Hey, I think I'll write a book with no commas or periods. People would think I am so modern and stylin'. Everyone would think I am a legend."
2,plainsong should be called plainbook,"this book is quite boring. It does have some exciting parts, but i often found myself getting bored and spacing out."
1,very Plain,"This is a plain story in a plain book. The lack of quote("""") marks makes reading the dialogue a bit more of a challenge."
1,Is everyone here being paid to write the reviews?,"It reeked. There is no plot, no storyline, no build-up, no climax, and pretty much no point. The author must feel that he is above proper punctuation because he almost never uses it. I wish I'd saved myself the time and money this book took from me."
2,The title is accurate--plain.,"I was not impressed. The book read ""just ok."" It filled up reading time, though I would have liked a more fulfilling book. I suppose the mundane bits of life do have a story that can be told. I guess I'm not into average liturature. I must say that the veterinary sceene was graphic, detailed, and far too extensive. I wonder if the author missed a calling?"
1,"Choppy and disjointed, poorly written, and just plain DUMB","I read the entire book waiting for some lightbulb to come on that never did.Improbable: A teenage girl living with two old men? Sounds like material for a porn site. She's placed there by her teacher? What sort of place is this that has no Child Welfare Agency??? It isn't the 1930'sI found this book on a rack at the local library under ""Libraian's Choice"". I'll be wary of anyone else's choices in the future!Why is there no ZERO STAR rating?"
2,Plainsong - It doesn't come close,I found plainsong quite unsatisfying. There is no way that it should have received four stars. I felt as though I were observing a community from the distant perch of a computer screen. Haruf keeps his readers secluded from the feelings and possible depth of these characters. The ending left me yearning for something more. (Possibly a better book.)
2,Don't try to make a short story into a novel,"I can't recall what drew me to buy this book, but I guess the cover reviews were enticing (on my copy, Roddy Doyle gave great praise). I have to say I was disappointed in the novel itself. I could'nt find a story to get into and there was a deal of contrivance in linking the rather disjointed episodes that make up the whole. In the end I decided it was either a writing exercise (Haruf is an academic after all) or a short story puffed up beyond its entitlement. While I'm not entirely put off reading more by the author, I will take the time to look beyond the reviews in future."
2,Ho Hum,"I was really disappointed in this book. I guess it's supposed to be a portrait of small town life in America, but to me it was just dull and dated. I found the characters to be lifeless cliches. Instead of getting absorbed in the story, I would say to myself ""Oh, so this is the part where the author's trying to drive home the harshness of rural life"" or whatever point the author was heavy-handedly driving at. It's also quite predictable. Gee, once the sick old loner gives the kids her house key, do you suppose they'll find her dead??? Please. The worst disappointment was how utterly unengaging the pregnant girl is - as lifeless and uninteresting as cardboard."
1,Trite; almost painful to get through,I listened to this book on tape. I had to go back and read the cover to see if this book was written for adolescents. The plot was so trite and the writing sophmoric. Why did the mother leave? Does anybody know....I almost cringed near the end when Victoria dropped the baby and nobody seemed concerned about that. I just dont get the positive reviews. The characters were underdeveloped and a lot was left unresolved.
2,not a must read,Had to read for a book discussion group. If not for the group would not finished. There are better reads ouy there
4,Very appealing.....,"When we were first assinged this book, I thought it was going to be just another boring book. I think this book is great. It keeps me interested because most of what is happening in plainsong happens to most highschool students and we can relate to it. It is a very quick and easy book to read, but it skips around a lot. You really have to use your imagination throughout the whole book to put pieces together. I recommend this book to everyone but you should be mature about it. Again I would almost read this again, just to laugh some more, because I have never laughed so much while reading a novel."
5,Well drawn characters,I cared about the characters and enjoyed the way their lives were woven together. I think people who enjoy this book will enjoy Reason For Leaving by John Manderino.
5,Excellent book. Period.,I enjoyed the writing style and interesting characters in this book. It is really many well crafted stories woven together to make an excellentbook. The author uses a minimalistic writing style that speaks volumes and is fun to read. I anticipated each new chapter. Give it a shot.
3,Plainsong from a Salida man,"Plainsong was an assignment given to our Senior English Class, and before reading this book, I was not excited and prepared for what it contained. Inside this book, I learned a lot about the character's lives through the authors Motifs using the weather as characters feelings. I live in a small town, and this novel is about a small town where it is easy to know others stories. I just moved here and can relate some of the situations. This novel goes into great detail about a few characters lives and their actions, and this took me by surprise. I do not enjoy reading much, and yet, I found this novel easy to read and understand. Kent Haruf seems to have much wisdom about the topics this novel holds within, and I was impressed with his knowledge and skill. Kent Haruf tells an amazing story of a community and the people who make it up. I recommend this novel to anyone who is prepared for some powerful words."
3,Author/reader kills audiotape,"It was a mistake to have the author read the book on audiotape; it often is, although not always. In this, Mr. Haruf does fine with male characters, but makes every woman in the book sound the same .. flat, lifeless, depressed, and indistinguishable one from another. That's too bad .. it was a lovely book to listen to, if not for this one problem, but problem it was indeed."
4,It just IS,"PLAINSONG is beautifully crafted, yet simple, like a piece of shaker furniture. True, we don't learn every detail of the characters' lives, (ie ""what really happened"" to Tom Guthrie's wife) Instead, we get a glimpse into the private lives of these people, in the here and now. The reader gets to be the fly on the wall.It's a good read. It just is."
4,Like a nice vanilla pudding--plain but very satisfying,"In the first several chapters of this book, Kent Haruf describes the bleak lives of seven characters--each wrapped in his or her own form of loneliness, each living without much hope. Even the barren cows on a cattle ranch seem to have tragic existences.But as the book goes on, all the characters find their lives intertwining, their solitude alleviated. By the end, seven disparate people have formed a small community, and it is clear that the community will last for years to come. The cows seem a little happier, too.While this book is not without its flaws (many of the characters lack complexity), its improbable outcome is the one we all like to think can happen, and the one we are often denied both in real life and in fiction. Sometimes it's very satisfying to read a book where things just work out okay in the end."
2,Flatsong,"Haruf's writing is lyrical at times, and the book presents an accurate description of the eastern Colorado landscape. Unfortunately, the novel lacks emotional impact. Events just happen without any depth of feeling that would cause the reader to connect with the characters. I was disappointed that the promise of what could have been an engaging story had not been fulfilled."
2,Overrated.,"This is the type of book that one might expect to see onOprah's book club: young girl warms the heart of two older bachelor brothers; high school teacher and colleague fall in love; small town where there are no secrets. But is has some serious problems, the most serious of which is that the character's actions do not really make sense. ... The reasons behind the character's decisions are not believable, especially when dealing with the bachelors. These characters are creating their own chaos, and to be plausible, the reader needs to buy into their reasoning. But there is too little conflict, too little soul-searching. The drama seems manufactured and banal, and that is really the most important part of a novel like this. END"
5,Breathtaking!,This book is awesome! I'm only 15 years old and yet Plainsong still has immense meaning. This makes me want to turn off the TV and read. If only requiered reading were this good...
4,My life is now complete thanks to Plainsong.,"This book was outstanding. I am a hard reader to please, but Kent Haruf was able ato do just that. His words jump out at you and pull you in. He does an great job of keeping the readers on thier toes. By the end of the book you feel as if you have had a personal relationship with all of the characters. Ike and Bobby personality are striking and funny. Kent Haruf will make you laugh and cry over and over again."
1,Not worth your time,I can't imagine why this book would have been nominated for any award. I didn't feel it was well written or worth my time. As an example: what was the intent of the chapter on the pet horse? It just didn't seem to fit with his story. It had no purpose other than to take up page space. I would suggest you pass on this book.
1,I've read better,"I have to say that I was really disappointed after reading this book. I believe that Haruf had a good idea and theme to write this book on, but did a horrible job of putting it all together. I felt like I was thrown a bunch of characters and plots that weren't related, and was expected to make up my own story. I liked the cover and think that it will look nice in my library, but that's probably where it will stay. I won't recommend it to anyone."
3,Slice of life,"This book centers around a small Colorado community and 7 of its citizens. First is Victoria Roubideaux, a young high school girl who is pregnant and has no place to go. Then there is Guthrie, a high school teacher, and his two boys Ike and Bobby whose mother stays in bed most of the time and eventually leaves the family. Guthrie has a friend named Maggie Smith, who is also a teacher, and the final two characters are the McPherons, two bachelor brothers who run a farm outside of town. The author titles his chapters with the names of these characters and gently weaves a story about their everyday lives. His prose is simple and spare, and he does not even include quotation marks when his characters are speaking. There are several situations which are never really explained nor are they resolved, and I found this frustrating as a reader. The strength of the book is in the characters, but the plot lacks structure and closure."
3,"Holy Hox, This Book Has What It Gots","Kent Haruf has put together an amazing book. Wonderfully well written, with intereasing well-developed characters, and great mini pots intertwined throughout the chaptres. Each chaptre is like a mini story in the book. In which the characters end up intertwining with each other at different parts in the book. He uses many literary elements in his writing. Such as motifs, ""ing"" pharses, and he uses great detal to paint a picture in the readers mind. He shows how life goes in small town, and the bond that a small town has with each of its town members. The way he the characters in the book make me wonder if he came from a samll colorado town. He knows samll town life all to well. It is a fast read, and it keeps the attation of the readers, with something that relates to you. A novel that feels like a short story. Read it is good for you and don't do drugs."
4,welcome to the world outside of a big city,"the word plainsong is said to mean a hymn or prayer. the citizens of holt may need this, as every person does. i would like you to meet Victoria Roubideux, Bobby and Ike Guthrie, Tom Guthrie and the McPheron brothers. all of these are key players in this intricate story of life in a small town. this story is so life like that you will wonder if you are reading a piece of fiction or a biography. i give this book 4 3/4 stars, and strongly recomend it."
3,Enjoyable Read,"I enjoyed reading Plainsong by Kent Haruf. The story was simple, easy to read and entertaining. The storyline was predictable, but in a good way. Things worked out the way you wanted them to, leading the story to be uplifting at the end. So many books today are tragic and sad, reading Plainsong was an enjoyable change. My only criticisms are that I felt the author didn't connect the characters as much as he could have. I didn't really identify with the group of them at the end, as I did individually throughout the book. Maggie is a lead character that ""ties"" the small rural community together and I feel the author could have made her a ""stronger character"" for that role. All in all, well written and fun."
1,Straining to be poetic,"What is the deal with the run-on sentences? They are distracting at best, incomprehensible at worst. I can't comment on the story line because I haven't finished the book...and don't know if I will after reading, ""Overhead the sky was as blue as just-washed cafe crockery and the sun was shining brilliantly."" I would expect to read something like that in a college creative writing class. I'll stick to Irving and Vonnegut...this ""flowery"" writing makes me cringe and distracts me from the story as I critique the poetry. In my opinion, if distracts from the story, it simply doesn't work."
4,A Book to Read,"Plainsong, written by Kent Haruf, is a wonderful and easy book to read. It kept me pretty interested throughout the book. I have to admit that there were some parts where I lost interest, but not very often. I really liked the integration of the stories. It always kept me wondering how everyone would finally meet and how the stories all came together. I grew up in Colorado, so I can picture the whole setting, yet there was still much left to my imagination. In addition, all of the stories seemed very realistic. I especially liked the story of Victoria. Her life seems almost unimaginable. She is a very strong girl. Waking up to two old men that you just met; walking around school knowing that everyone is gossiping about you; and living in a completely unstimulating life; now that is amazing. The stories of Guthrie, Ike, and Bobby are equally incredible, though being a seventeen year old girl myself; I understand the character of Victoria best."
3,flexing motif muscles,"Plainsong is the kind of book that is revealing but its almost not intense enough. Plainsong is a contempory novel written in a time zone a lot like ours. The book starts out with a pregnant 17 year old, a pair of boys with bairly no mother, and a lonly teacher. Throughout the book the characters are faced with problems that are overcome with friendship and love.Throughout the book most of the stories kept me very interested. But some of them had to many description in them and that got really kinda old to read. I did like how the story reflected modern day situations and had lots of detail to back it up. The book was worth the read but its not like I would ever read it again."
5,A favorite of mine,"With its unassuming simplicity and compelling characters, Plainsong weaves a gentle narrative of life on the high plains. I have read this book several times and each time I come away with a feeling of reverence. My heart is full and not everything is alright just like life anywhere.Haruf has the ability to bring the reader fully into his vision without being too wordy. Read it and treasure it."
3,Interesting up to a point but unsatisfying at the end,"I thought this book had great potential. The characters were interesting and the plot was cleverly interwoven to include all the main characters eventually but the book just kind of ends, leaving me hanging and wanting more. I guess it is a sign that a book is good if you want to read more, but it tends to leave me feeling unsatisfied. Was the author intending to write a sequel to this book because he certainly left a lot of questions unanswered. Maybe that was his intention but I always say if you got a story to tell, finish what you start and don't leave so many things dangling. I would still recommend this book but I wish the author would write another book to tie up the loose ends."
3,A Concept to think about,"Plainsong is the story of three groups of people - a pregnant girl, a father of two, and two old bachleors. These three groups will become intertwined in very realistic and ordinary ways. Plainsong presents a look at everyday people dealing with their life issues.Haruf paints a picture for the reader of the need for family and challenges the reader to think about what constitutes a family. The message that I gained from reading Plainsong was that of family by choice. Once you have love, caring and commitment within a group of people you have the seeds of a family.Plainsong was an interesting novel to read. Often as readers we expect the deep and dark rather than the ordinary. This is a new concept to behold. I have spent alot of time reflecting on Plainsong and the strongest message is of the necessity family in any form. I would recommend this book."
5,Not PLain at All!,"This book is a great novel and I loved it! It took me a while to read because I got into it so much that I had to stop, but when it was over, I wanted to read more about the creative characters that Kent HAruf made up. It was a great book, as are Haruf's other books (The Tie that Binds, and Where You Once Belonged.) When you read this book, look for eight main characters that make up Kent Haruf's wonderful, compelling Plainsong!"
2,"sparse, evocative and... overrated","like 'snow falling on cedars' plainsong has received great reviews... too great. the sparse prose and sparser punctuation is similar to cormac mccarthy, giving us two modern western authors who apparently believe the silence of big empty spaces is best rendered without quotation marks. at the end of the day plainsongs foreboding juxtaposition of stories is ultimately only Plainly interesting, neither cathartic, nor uplifting, nor artful enough to qualify for greatness sans plot. but now we know: what would 'my antonia' be like set in 1996? for the angst of the modern small town west mcmurtry's 'duane's depressed' goes a lot deeper, and is a lot more fun, too."
5,Thank You Mister Haruf,"Plainsong has characters that catch the reader's attention early in the book and holds one until the reader grows to love them with all their quirks. Kent Haruf gives us enough insight to each of the character's stories to arouse curiosity over what he or she is going to do next. Although the style is never told in first person, I am reminded of Kingslover's Poisonwood Bible, for it was in that novel that I felt so strong a connection to the characters. I will take the time to read more of Mister Haruf's work, as I am happy to find a novel that I enjoyed this extensively."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book annoying to read. The style has potential, and appears to be letting the characters speak for themselves. However, the author's prejudices come through way too strongly. It is very clear that some characters are ""good"" and the others are ""bad""; some of the characters are very close to being caricatures. There is no character development to speak of."
2,This is what our President is reading? sigh,I am reading this as Kindle said our President is reading it this week. I was curious...and so far disappointed. The lack of quotation marks is annoying and the sex scenes sort of cheap...and gross picturing our President reading it at the same time. lol Definately not the deep writing I expected. It is ok...but more like $3 ok.
3,I really have no opinion after listening to this book.,"It was pretty flat, like others have said. I thought the scene in the shack with the boys was totally unneccessary. Not enough plot, or understanding of it in the book as a whole. Liked the old men though, and Victoria. What did Guthrie have to do with this story anyway? The characters didn't seem to mesh. Oh well. It was a book."
5,Simply wonderful,"A entrancing novel, I won't forget it and am now impatiently waiting for Kent Haruf's next book."
5,Loved this book!,All the praise which has been heaped upon this books is well deserved. Only wish I could give it more stars.
3,Simple plot. Flat characters. Trite &#65533;deeper meaning&#65533;.,"Simple plot. Flat characters. Trite ""deeper meaning""."
2,yawn,"I was duped by all the wonderful reviews I read of this book. I found it boring, contrived and meandering. The characters just seemed to wander around bumping into eachother occasionally, with no real sense of purpose. Like the title says, it is ""plain,"" but not in a good way. I guess I just expect more from a book."
1,Not intersesting at all,"The author tries to pull you into the lives of too many people at once. I really wanted to find out more about some of the characters but it got to a point where I just didn't care and I couldn't finish the book. It's got sex, love and trouble but never at any point does Kent answer any questions. How this book won an award is beyond me.Skip this book unless you like being confused and cheated out of a good read."
1,Worthless,"I listen to a lot of books on tape in my car and this was one of the worst. A vulgar, angry waste of time. There is no interesting dialog or plot and we are left hanging at the end. Don't bother - there is nothing of value here."
1,Complainsong,"I beg to differ from almost everyone else--from the title I anticipated something more serene until my reading was jarred by gratuitous sexual scenes and white-trash swearing, which did not contribute anything to the story. It seemed that some of these paragraphs were just ""stuck in there"" to satisfy todays taste for the gross and crass, making sure the book would be bought. To repeat, it disturbed me that some of the language and sexual encounters were very gratuitous. For the remainder, the book wasn't all that well written, no jewel of the English language. Sorry, but this is my opinion."
4,Reconnect with your humanity,"I read voraciously, mostly contemporary fiction, and I have been very disappointed with most offerings I have read in the past 12 months. Plainsong is a great exception to that rule. It is definitely plain, if you're looking for a pot boiler, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you're looking for a novel with real, complex human emotions and truly touching characters, then this is the work for you. It will allow you to reconnect with your humanity."
4,A Slice of American Pie,"I agree with the professional reviewers in that the book is an enticing slice of rural, small-town America. The author has been there: He has seen cattle separated from the herd, witnessed life on an isolated farm, been a young boy on the loose trying to figure it all out, and experienced the cruelty of the restless teenager.My only quibble is with occasional lapses in wording. The author overuses the word ""about""....""about 10:30,"" ""about ten feet from here...""And his time sequences are infrequently off kilter, as when Victoria goes out to the barn at 5:00 to report her labor pains,but the three of them then ""waited the rest of the afternoon"" to make a decision about the inevitable hospital trip. Time seems to be very important to Haruf, as if he constantly reworked time sequences, but there needs to be a tad more editing.Generally, a very good read."
1,Just not very good,"I agree with all the other one star reviews. I forced myself to finish as the cover indicated it got good reviews. But it is cloying and dull. Reading it is like trying to have a meaningful conversation with someone who keeps going off into pointless, boring tangents in an attempt to be interesting. The language tries to be colloquial but comes off as just too precious. The cover review actually compared this book to Chekov, which is like comparing Brittny Spears to Renee Fleming. Just not very good at all."
1,How can you get past page 2?,"I was so out of breath reading ""and then, and then, and then...."" I couldn't read the rest of it. I stopped after: ""He went out into the hall again past the closed door AND on into the bathroom AND shaved AND rinsed his face AND went back to the bedroom at the front of the house whose high windows overlooked Railroad Street AND brought out shirt AND pants from the closet AND laid them out on the bed AND took off his robe AND got dressed."" (page 4, 4th paragraph) FINALLY!!! A PERIOD! WHEW! It was nothing but one continuous sentence to me! My sister enjoyed this book and wanted me to read it. I really don't think I can! I can't seem to get over the long sentences."
2,Plainsong was disappointing,"After all the hype and reviews, I was disappointed.The author seemed to lose focus, and the book was a bit slow, though the underlying theme was good."
1,Plainsong,"As part of a book club, I read this book. The point of my joining the bookclub was to read books I might normally not have picked up on my own, as I am open to reading about new ideas and subjects everyday. A friend of mine and I both read this book and the next time we met , the looks on our faces said it all. WHAT A WASTE OF GOOD PAPER! I see that the book has now been made into a movie and I told my friend such. All she could say is 'NOOOOO!' My favorite part of the book was 'blah blah blahblahblah, BLAH?' Oh, wait that wasn't part of it but the whole book sure READ like that."
1,How has this gotten such high ratings???,"I am not impressed with this author for the following reasons:1. Blatant disregard for proper punctuation - this makes the text difficult to follow and the story without emotion. The character's dialogue isn't in quotation marks. IE: Look out there is a car coming, said Mark. VS. ""Look out! There is a car coming,"" exclaimed Mark.2. Author was completely ineffective in developing characters and finishing storylines. Too many unanswered questions and things left unsaid.3. Author was completely ineffective at creating a timeless story. At first it seemed like the 50's, then he talked about stick pregnancy tests and VCR's so that brought it to 80's then the tone seemed 50's again.4. Having been born and raised in the plains of Colorado, I was eager to read this story but it didn't come close to adequately representing life there. Written from a city slicker transplant perspective."
3,"plain indeed, ah reckon","There was this man named Haruf and he wrote in a terse style that reminded you of Hemingway or of Carver but then again not like Hemingway and Carver but with a long run-on style to reiterate the fact that this was a plain novel with a plain theme and plain people living out on the plain. And there were little epiphanies where people reckon this and that and that like a dead horse havin' its belly cut up and the profound feeling the kids have watching this dead horse with its belly cut up and some of the other scenes were touching and made you smile but never mind that you could skip whole pages of dialogue because quite frankly you know nothing happened but a this sparse, dry style with sentences that reminded you of Hemingway or Carver but then again not really Hemingway or Carver and oh well this was an OK book but if you're sick of this style then skip this book."
4,A good read with a slow start,"Plainsong, was truly one of the better books I have read.When I first bought the book I tried to read it but found the start long and drawn out. Later, when I started reading it again, I found it to be very good, I couldn't put it down. It is a very slow starting book, but if you give it time, Plainsong is an excellent read.Mr. Haruf is amazing! This book has so much emotion and feeling it actually made me cry. The way that everything is described in this book is unsurpassed by most authors. I think most people are able to identify with at least one of the characters.If you are looking for a good book to read on those cold winter days curled up in a blanket, or in bed, then this book is for you, but if you're looking for a book to read on the train, subway or bus, you will probably have some trouble following this book.~Happy Reading!~"
5,A Satisfying Read,"There are several in-depth reviews here that cover many of this novel's strengths. Personally, I often find myself dissatisfied with many modern novel's endings. This one was complete and gratifying. After sharing his characters with us successfully throughout the story, Haruf doesn't let readers down in the last few pages."
4,A Visit to Colorado,"Plainson appears to be a narrative of a visit to a small town in Colorado. The author brings the reader into the ongoing lives of people. Characters and personalities are introduced. Everyone has their problems (maybe more than in some places)and they go about their lives. The reader leaves as unobtrusively as arriving. There is no resolution to the text (just as often happens in real life) except that maybe the presence of new life in the form of a baby binds people together in hope. There is the feeling that the story goes on. I thought the book started slowly and then found myself hooked. The author weaves the reader into the events so you can't wait to see what happens next. There is no climax in the plot - just good people and not so good people going about life in their own way. It remineded me of the play ""Our Town"". By the way, I did not read this book but listened to it on tape. The performance was superb. I would highly recommend it."
3,Title says it all..,"You don't have to go past the cover to realize the overall mood of this book. The title is called ""Plainsong"" and it is just that PLAIN. This book is OK if you are looking for a quick read requiring little pondering."
3,"Great writing, but disappointing","Really this book has four stories in it - some more interesting than the others. Definitely the most interesting story - and the one which keeps you reading - has to be about Victoria Roubidoux, a pregnant teenager who is taken in by two older, uneducated farmers who are also brothers who never married. This, in and of itself, was a leap of faith for me. I found it difficult to believe that two men in their 50s would take in a pregnant teenager who is not a relative and someone whom they'd never met before - especially in a small rural town. In fact, wouldn't a young girl be afraid of living with two single older men?While Haruf's writing in this book is very good, unfortunately it's the only good part of the book. I was prepared for a brilliant ending which would bring the four stories together, but the ending fell severely short of brilliant. A different ending would've made this an incredible book. Instead, I finished the book and thought to myself, ""So?"""
3,A STORY ABOUT NORMAL PEOPLE EXPERIENCING NORMAL PROBLEMS,"Plainsong is an interesting story, but it is more or less just a story about regular people living through tough situations. It deals with pregnancies, sex and violence, and how everyone experiences hardships over the course of life. It it just that, a Plainsong. Delving into the everyday acts of the various characters. None of them are crazy, or extraordinary in any way, but they are just like you and me. That was the best part of the story was in the way that it was real. This was not a fairy tale or fabricated tale, they were stories about men and women much like all of us. So it was quite easy to relate to them in many situations as they face the many troubles that the world has to offer. Great book to read once, but I probably won't remember a whole lot of it down the road."
4,A Small Town Mosaic,"Kent Haruf paints the life of a small Colorado town through a series of short chapters that read like short stories. The lives of many members of the community are intertwined in thoughtful, creative ways, and the reader feels like a spy on the goings-on of a small town. The characters and stories are interesting, with stories that will keep a reader's attention. The prose style is beautiful and easy to read, and the chapter order well-designed, implying connections between the characters on a thematic level as well as their interactions. I found myself slowing down to enjoy the scenery as I took in the small town of Holt."
3,Unforgetable Characters,"Several respected reader friends told me that this was one of their all time favorite books. Another respected reader friend warned that it was very slow going. My experience was closer to the warning friend. The characters are truly memorable, but I would have like those memorable characters to be a bit more active. You really had to love the batchelor brothers, but the other characters were sort of underdeveloped I thought. Also, I hate it when a book just ends without resolution. This one does that.But, the above said , I plan to read more of Haruf's work."
3,Mixed feelings,"I just finished Plainsong and found many things to admire, most of all the writing itself, which was generally graceful and unadorned. The best parts of the book were the sections focusing on daily life on the prairie -- a glimpse of a world that seemed very genuine.And yet, some of the central relationships in the book didn't ring true. In particular, there is a plotline about a pregnant teenager who goes to live with two elderly bachelor brothers. Haruf isn't so successful with this: I had the feeling that he hasn't spent as much time around pregnant teenagers as he has around cattle. Also, this set of brothers (and another pair in the book) are not developed as well as they should be. It's almost impossible to tell one brother from the other.Nonetheless, I read Plainsong today on a rainy afternoon and was very glad of its company."
2,Left me sleepy...,I kept hanging on to the chapters of this book hoping that the story would pick up. This book was quite boring to me. I expect a book to grab me and this one didn't..instead of being a page turner this was a put-downer. There didn't seem much thought at all put into this book. Definitley a let down...
2,disappointed,"I kept thinking this book would get better as i read but it just didn't. There was nothing spectacular to it. Yes, it's a ""nice little story"" but not worth your time."
1,Plainsong on the bubble,"At first this book seemed very boring. But as time progressed I felt like I was part of the story. It seemed very sexually graphic at the begginning. The boys were exicted to hear about people having sex, but they felt very sorry for the girl in the story. The author was not afraid to say what he felt. It would be very hard to be the girl that got pregnant. After all the bad things that happened the boys turned out alright."
2,Too plain,"Kent Haruf's third novel Plainsong wants to be a modest book, judging by the title. And it is. It depicts the disintegration of several dysfunctional families in the little town of Holt, Colorado, and then the seemingly random formation of new and better units. The prose is laconic yet it creates rather beautiful, subdued portrayal of everyday life in the smalltown. Problem is that it is also rather pretentious in its solemnity, and cannot really hide the fact that this story is painfully plain as analysis of the domestic problems in today's society. There are several nicely done scenes, but Haruf likes his world black and white, resulting in good guys that are so very good and bad guys that are so very bad. Ending is also too saccharine, almost reactionary in its firm appraisal of traditional family values. Disney will not need to change a word if they ever make a movie out of this."
1,"I, too, missed something",Just to say I totally agree with Kent. This book was a large disappointment after all the good reviews I had read.
1,"Too ""artsy"" for this reader!","(And no, I've never read Finnegans Wake either.)e.e. cummings abhored capital letters. Evidently, Kent Haruf thinks it high literary style to eschew quotation marks - or, as Tom Robbins calls them: ""earrings."" Yes, Mr. Robbins, they are ""earrings"" when the author wishes to note that something is being called something which it may not be - for example ""a good book""- but quotation marks also perform the very useful function of letting the reader know when a character is speaking. This midwestern reader found this book to be too disconcerting - the lack of punctuation impedes the flow - makes one constantly have to ""translate"" as one is trying to read.Life is too short - and there are too many readable books out there to waste time on this one. I gave up on page 62. It's interesting that, on the jacket where they are trying to sell the book, the publishers know quite well how to use quotation marks!"
1,Plainsong = Bad Book...........Plainsong + Vodka= Good Book!,"I had to read plainsong for school and it was a horrible book. It's boring and has no depth. As others have said, this book is littered with nothing but useless information and too much sex. Some sex is relevant to a book- however too much sex is just like an erotic story. I warn anyone who has to read this book- drink massive amounts of alcohol before reading."
4,Predictable yet satisfying,"Let's start by admitting that we all know the difference between great books and those that are merely a delight to read. ""Plainsong"" surely falls into the latter category. None of the many characters in this highly readable novel are, in and of themselves, particularly memorable. None are fully fleshed out, and a few border on being little more than caricatures. But none of that takes away from the fact that Haruf can tell a fine, engrossing story, in which there are mildly heroic heroes and somewhat unpleasant villains (this is the High Plains, after all -- everything is of necessity toned down in keeping with the title of the book) and a series of different stories weave together nicely towards a deeply satisfying emotional payoff.A rich read for the airport or the beach (not a bookclub), and well worth the paperback price."
3,Much ado about nothing,"As much as I liked the writing, I found the story puzzling and disjointed and saying Maggie tied it together is ridiculous. What I mainly want to know is, why did those boys ride their bikes out to the McPherons? What did I miss there? The lack of quotation marks didn't bother me, and I actually enjoyed the minimalist dialogue, but it just wasn't much of a story."
3,"Something to know before reading ""Plainsong""","There are no quotation marks in this entire book. Haruf handles this style very skillfully, creating dialogue that is not confusing to the reader, but it's a device that isn't necessarily a welcome innovation. (You be the judge.) This is one stripped-down style book. I thought it was interesting enough to read in its entirety, but I wasn't moved by it."
3,"Down To Earth, Decent Characters","Plainsong is ""any simple or unadorned melody"" and that aptly describes the characters in the book. It is small time life at it's best with honorable and hard-working people. I enjoyed all the characters, especially the McPheron brothers (worth reading just for the meeting these two guys :). I felt sorry for Bobby and Ike and do wish the author would have spent more time detailing the 'how and why' of their mother's behavior. All in all, Plainsong is just about 'plain' people with problems, joys, and sorrows just like all of us. The characters have to come to terms with loss and rise above it. Haruf does a good job showing how these characters grow and learn some hard lessons. An enjoyable read!"
5,Loved this book!,"I listened to this story on Recorded Books audio and unlike a previous reviewer, I loved it. I wish there was a sequel; Kent Haruf writes dialogue that is so real and typical of the area. I am from a small farming community and the two older brothers were so comical, they reminded me of lots of people I know. The story centers around Victoria, a teenage girl who finds herself pregnant and kicked out of her mother's house. With nowhere else to go she ends up depending on the kindness of a few people in her community. The author has really captured the personalities of all the characters. The only thing that disappointed me was that the story had to end. I am looking forward to reading anything else by Kent Haruf and will definitely recommend this book to anyone."
5,Beautiful story!,"I purchased this book after reading all the raving reviews in the front of it. I couldn't put it down once I started. Parts of the story literally brought me to tears. The McPheron brothers were probably my favorite. They come to life off of the pages. The conversations they have with one another made me laugh and smile. I found all the characters in the book to be interesting and exactly the type of people you would find in a small town. The book was an enjoyable ""getaway"" from the fast paced world I live in. After I finished the book I went out and bought ""Eventide"" to see what happens next!!"
4,A day in the life of a small town,"The combination of characters in PLAINSONG are indeed unique. As I started the novel I wondered how they would all mesh. In many ways, this book is a ""day in the life"" of Holt, Col. The author manages to look at one relatively short period of time, a little less than a year, and show what happened to the characters and how their lives changed. It's a period of change for all of them espcially Victoria and the two young boys, Bobby and Ike. In fact it is a period of change for all of the characters, Tom, Maggie and the two McPherson brothers.I got the EVENTIDE out of the library. It apparently continues the story. I'm sure that I will read it, but I'm not sure if it had been better to leave the characters were they are at the end of PLAINSONG and let each reader speculate as to what happens to them; how this period of time and the changes they went through effected the rest of thief lives."
2,Plaindisappointing,"This is a typical ""best seller"" that I fell into where the characters are simple, predictable in their illogical behaviors, sappy, and boring. The plot is of little relevence to any real life situation and the book was neither educative nor entertaining. I have a hard time knowing why there has been such a favorable response to this work other than it doesn't tax one's thoughts too much. It isn't even on a par with Oprah's books. The cover is well-designed and promising, which goes to confirm that you can't judge a book on its cover."
1,"Disappointing, very disappointing","The only thing greater than my anticipation for reading this book was the disappointment I had after I finished. I had a few people tell me how much they liked the book. I had a hard time finding why they liked it. The characters had very little development. Only one of the characters got my attention - the pregnant teenager. I thought the characters and plots they were in were bland. Call me prude, but the book had way too many references to sex. And many of those references didn't seem important to the characters and flow of the book."
5,Comfort and Caring,"A warm , meandering story of the lives and emotions of simple people living day to day lives. Easy to connect with the characters as they face and work through their emotional ups and downs, and find the strenght to continue on with life and those they love. A well written, easy and enjoyable story."
3,"Quick enjoyable read, until the end drops off","I read this in three hours. The writing was compelling, as was the character development (until the very end). Guthrie, his wife and young sons are self-absorbed, as is Victoria. The brothers McPheron and Mrs. Maggie Jones are the only other-focused characters. I expected things to come together better at the end, instead of feeling like Haruf thought, ""ooh, 300 pages, I'd better end this NOW!"" It didn't make sense, and the end felt contrived. I didn't understand how they all got together in the final chapter (it would have worked better had it been called Epilogue instead of Holt). I was expecting maybe some kind of tragedy or something that would make the characters rally together and persevere, realize their commonalities, and find they needed each other. But everyone had their own life, and didn't take any initiative to make a difference. The end was a downer, and I'd expected to finish the book feeling good."
5,I still think about it ...,"... even though I finished it three months ago.After reading so many average books, spending a few days with Haruf's breakout novel renewed my hope in contemporary literature.Yes, literature; for those who get bored without plot twists and clever, two-faced characters with extraordinary abilities, this book is too good for you.This is nothing more than a beautifully written account of a people you've probably passed on a two-lane highway. Their stories aren't magnificent, but are laden with enough conflict and personality to carry a simple plot line.I have told everyone I know about this book. It is refreshing and artistic.Plainsong is always warm, but never fuzzy."
2,Just Plain Boring,"What was that? The lack of quotation marks alone are enough to get on anyone's last nerve. I thought everyone learned how to use quotation marks back in the fourth grade, but Mr. Haruf obviously did not. The countless number of run-on sentences didn't help much either. I don't understand how it got the excellent reviews that it did. The plot was dull and it left me feeling as though it didn't end. Why did Guthrie's wife act the way she did and leave her little boys? Victoria's mother is introduced only to kick her daughter out of the house. I wanted to like Victoria's character, but she too proved to be just as boring as the rest. This book proved to me that just about anyone can get a book deal these days."
5,great book,"I read this book for my bookclub. Wonderful story, deep and moving with a real life element. I really love the characters."
4,plain but not simple,"I enjoyed this book more than expected. The story was a little slow in the beginning, but the characters begin to come together fairly quickly. Although there are no quotations marks, the book is an easy read. It also holds your attention throughout and leaves you feeling good. I would recommend it."
5,Wonderfully constructed,The simplicity of the prose is perfect for both the setting and the story. I was struck by the kindness of the characters and the way Haruff brought them alive with an economy of words. Beautiful job of writing. From one novelist to another - congratulations on an exquisite tale!
2,A melody I couldn't quite hear,"I know this book won awards and I have read the review of others who really liked it but I have to say that I found it lacking. It seemed very slow to get into anything (I guess kind of like the characters themselves). I had to fight to continue to read this novel until more than half way through. At that point the characters began to peak my interest and I guess there was a certain curiousity as to how things would turn out. Perhaps because I don't have any experience of a small town in the west I couldn't quite deal with the pace of the storyline. Most times when I finish a book I hate to leave the characters, I want to remain in their lives and continue to see where life takes them. I didn't really care about these folks and I'm not quite sure why. The story just didn't grab me."
3,Plainsong,"I'm sure there are people who really enjoy this novel, particularly if you want to make parallel connections between characters that eventually end up together like at the end of a TV movie. My reaction was... Meh."
2,I see this is on Obama's vacation reading list...,"I wonder if he'll do as I did (and as several other reviewers did also) and stop reading after about 100 pages?The missing quotation marks didn't bother me, neither did the run-on sentences. And -- in the beginning -- I was entranced by the prose.I began to sour on the book when it seemed that another author had taken over the writing of the second half: the prose became cloying, the plot twists were predictable, and I imagined it becoming a template for a schmaltzy made-for-TV movie.Soon after, I put it down, half-finished, and eventually put it into the stack of books headed for the library's sale.A big disappointment."
2,Tedious!,"I keep thinking I a missing something, because so many people loved this book, but to me, the story just fell flat. The ending just didn't make sense. For every plot point that was wrapped up, there was a plot point left unresolved.Heartwarming?? Cozy?? No, this book was more about the cruelty of life, but the characters seem to run and hide from their problems instead of confront and conquer them.I know, I know I ""get"" the ""plainsong"" idea. Simple, unadorned, but this book just got to be flat out boring!"
1,Award winning? Really?,"Haruf is obviously a talented writer. Unfortunately unlike truly great writers, he is unable to convey the depths of character without subjecting readers to the forms of writing usually reserved for cheap romance novels. The graphic sex scenes are gratuitous and one must wonder about Mr. Haruf's voyeuristic tendancies. I read this because it is required reading for my sophomore son. It is certainly not appropriate reading material for a 15 year old, or for anyone really. If it had been a great story I could have tried to overlook the tawdry nature of the writing, but no such luck. Do yourself a favor. Skip this one."
2,Plainsong,Hmmpphhh... How are there so many five-star reviews?? I just don't get it. The book's an okay read and chapter-by-chapter it is somewhat entertaining but it never comes to a conclusion. I kept waiting for it all to come together but it just didn't. What a disappointment.
4,Tai Chi Figures,"These Tai Chi figures are great overall. They are made of ceramic and very sturdy. They show the various Tai Chi moves. I always wanted to try Tai Chi, but so far I haven't had a chance. Maybe when I retire. All of the figures are Asian men which I don't like. There should be at least one woman too, just like in the Supreme Court. Also, there should be better representation of the various ethnic groups: a Caucasian, an African/African-American, a Hispanic, and of course, an Asian. If there were more figures, some of the other ethic groups could be represented such as the Native American. So, if the lack of diversity doesn't bother you, these figures would make a great addition to your collection of Tai Chi figures."
4,Excellent foundation for coding PERL,"""Cross-Platform"" is always out on my desk. It is an excellent reference book and explains difficult concepts simply. The only criticism that I have is that it doesn't explore ODBC programming in-depth (but, nobody does!?). The author is accesible for questions as directed in the book. The CD is perfect for establishing a PERL environment on your WIN32 desktop. If Eric writes an ODBC book and I'll be first in line."
3,"A good introduction, but only adequate in-depth Perl Win32","This is a good introductory Perl book, with logical treatments for basic Perl commands. With the ""cross-platform"" in the title, however, I would expect more in-depth discussion about how things (complicated things) can be done in Perl Win32, such as multithreading."
2,Hard to listen to,"Strictly for fans. I'd pick 1.5 stars if I could. I love the sisters' work, and have all of it, but find this album an effort. The contributions of the outsiders is unwelcome. If you've heard great things about the McGarrigles and want to know where to start, stay away from this one. Buy instead Heartbeats Accelerating (my favourite), Matapedia, or Kate and Anna McGarrigle (debut album) -- all 5 stars."
2,A dull collection of folk songs,A disappointment to one who loved their early work. The magic is just not there.
2,Extremely disappointing,"I have always loved the McGarrigle sisters and this new cd sounded impressive because of the various artists involved, not just the McGarrigles. I was hoping to use one of the cuts on it for a short slide show I was making. Unfortunately (for me) there was no way to hear samples so I ordered the cd based on all of the reviews. I played it, I heard it, I was bored and disappointed because it didn't come close to the excellence and originality of past recordings. Quite frankly there is no reason to ever play it again. I offered it to my husband to keep in the car. Once he heard it, he declined my offer. In the future if there isn't an opportunity of hearing samples before ordering, I will not take the chance again."
4,Good but not Great,"Got this album today, and all in all a very well sung(as you would expect) piece of work. Nice to hear the family members, especially the girls have such good voices. I was first turned on to the McGarrigles by hearing Kate I think singing a track called ""House in the Country"" on the Albion Band record of the 80's ""Rise Up Like The Sun"" and was struck by the sweetness and kinda vulnerability in her voice.I then didn't hear a lot more of the sisters until the T.V. programme Transatlantic Sessions, when their version of ""Talk to me of Mendecino"" was just about the greatest bit of harmony singing (and a great song)that I had heard in a long time. The version on this CD did not move me in the same way, so I was a little disappointed, but good singing just the same. All the tracks are well worth a listen, and this is undoubtedly a very good album, which will reward listening for many years to come."
5,An excellent discussion of the realities of Vietnam,"This book eloquently captures the struggles and realities of Brewer's Vietnam War experience and his return after being wounded. This is hardly a ""poor me"" study but instead a thought provoking narrative about a time in US history that far too many of us don't understand.Written in a very readable style it should be recommended reading for every high school/college student studying the Vietnam War and a must read for any teacher attempting to cover the topic."
5,"Best book I've ever read about Viet Nam, the real deal.","This book takes you on the whole ride' a mans life and his journey there and back. A must read for anyone who wants to know the real story, no gloss just the real deal, a mans conclusions on war."
1,DO NOT waste your time...,"This movie was so bad and yet I watched it all just to see if possibly it would get better. It didn't. The only one that can act is the damn monkey and even then the character development is slim. I always buy Halmark movies, they've been great (10th Kingdom etc) but this one is the worst movie they've ever endorsed. I read all the reviews and decided to give it a chance-save yourself the dissapointment. The movie could have been so good. The plot is quite good but the screenplay, acting, effects, are not. A goddess having a drink at the bar...come on, even I won't watch something that lame. Mythology is something I love but the way these people portray it becomes laughable, and disrespects the story it's trying to tell. Most of all you can't even like the hero because he is so annoying! Buy the Snow Queen, Jack and the Beanstalk, DEFINETLY 10th Kingdom, but don't buy this movie!(no, don't even think about giving it a chance because it has a cool cover)"
1,Steaming Pile of Racism,"I have never, ever been more offended in my entire life. As a Chinese-Canadian, I was grown up on Monkey King fairy tales. But this.....this abomination is no tribute to Wu Ch'eng-en's original Epic. Besides for the fact onyl 1 of the main characters is even Asian, all the Demons seem to by. To top it all off, the producers forced David Hwang to focus the entire story on a white man/Asian Goddess romance.How pathetic."
1,Special Effects are Just Cheezy,"I can see that whoever made this, put a lot of time and money into it trying to make this a big successful production, however, this fantasy film is best for ages 10 and under. Special effects, script lines, acting and story are significantly lacking what the blockbuster's have. Too bad."
1,What a waste of time...,"Recently there has been a surge of interest in ""fantasy"" type films. With the huge success of ""Lord of the Rings,"" I belive, people are exploring other movies, similar in nature. Well, if you're an adult and you're getting reacquainted with the fantasy genre, this is one to MISS. Ignore it. Keep on walking. Its really just for kids, at best. The story is predictable and it repeats itself, hour past hour. The special effects are good enough for Saturnday morning t.v. but that's about it. I suggest you look at ""Arabian Nights"" instead."
5,i love this movie... but amazon... please,Please release this movie for Amazon Instant Video. I bought a Roku2 for this occasion to watch movies from the site that i make most of my purchases on. this movie is a wonderful movie.. its a draw back and a pain to find that you or anyone else has this movie on internet video streaming. even netflix doesnt have this movie on there internet streaming system. please add this to a Amazon instant video. thank you.
3,Not as good,"If you live in the US all of your life, you might find this series exotic. For an Asian like me, The movie has a weak plot and slow on action and too much Drama, for a fantacy movie. The Monkey King and his techer are the only things that were quite ok because they are quite funny. For some reasons, the goddess speech's annoyed me so (I rather listen to Arnold or Jacky Chan). I think they choose the wrong leading man, Shouldn't he be doing a romance or a comedy. Can't really point my finger on the wrong things but I only can see this movie once, not like Merlin, Gulliver's Travell, Arabian night, the Odessey ot even the 10th Kingdom. How ever it is still a little bit better than Noah's ark or Alice and wonderland.(all because of the exotic Eastern story)."

4,The Lost Empire no Longer Lost,This DVD was extremely fun to watch especially if you are interested in Chinese culture. The special effects are great for a TV movie as well as the make-up and costumes. It also has some great acting from chinese actors that you don't get to see enough of in other movies.
3,empire got lost,this looked more interesting than it was a followig of a what if? the classic book journy to the west was not written? the primis is o.k if love the chinse folk tale but over2 and a half houres it was too long hallmark tried to doa narnia tnpe movie but fell on ther face good special effects though.
3,Wiggles Greg Doll,Bought this for as a gift for my nephew. He was 3 yrs old at the time and VERY into the Wiggles. Not much more I can say except doll is a bit creepy.
4,Charlotte Lamb's savage surrender,"From the back of the book:Her secret saved her from Alex's charmsSophie loved Crete. Working there as secretary to Madame Leftas was like a dream come true. It was far away from England and the secret, impossible love for Simon that she had to forget.When Alex, Madame's playboy son, began a campaign to add Sophie to his list of casual conquests, she was merely indifferent. No one could replace Simon anyway.Or so Sophie thought... until the night Alex found her in Simon's arms. Then began a campaign of a different sort-one Alex was determined to win"
1,Doesn't plug into your generator.,Do not buy this thinking it will plug directly into your generator. It will not Amazon would not refund my money but would issue a gift certificate which I will use on another order.
2,It leaks!,"Leaves tiny specks over the paper, and this is without the stamp even touching it. Leaves gloppy, sloppy very wet impression."
5,Great Sex great book,"I found this book to be informative, easy to read and very witty. So many of the books on sex are written in a manner that makes the layman feel stupid. This book is written with a style that makes the subject understandable and non-threatening. I will definitely recommend it to my clients and friends."
3,No Comment,"This is definately not a subject I feel comfortable reviewing for the masses. I did learn a few things but not enough to say ""This is a great book"". Could be helpful to younger people that is twenty somethings"
2,Pretty Good,"This book could have been better but was still full of good, useful information. The author repeats paragraphs verbatim SEVERAL times throughout the book which I found really annoying."
2,Not Specific,"This book is full of platitudinous, common sense self help that you can find for free on the web. Not worth buying..."
1,Great Sex: A Man's Guide to the Secret Principles of Total-Body Sex by,"The seller did not/could not provide the book. I received a refund, but would rather have received the book. I wish Amazon had sought an alternate supplier rather than just refunding the money."
5,Fantastic--but Mistitled--book,"We got this book because my husband was having trouble cuming. The chapter on ejaculation problems helped him a lot. Then we read the rest of the book, and realized that Great Sex is NOT just a ""man's"" guide. It's for women and couples, too. I thought I knew all about women's sexuality (being one). But I was amazed at how much this ""man's"" book taught this woman. I can truly say that since reading Great Sex, my husband and I have had better sex, in fact, great sex."
5,Better Than the Best,Great Sex by Michael Castleman should have been entitled Great Love and Sex. It contains a life time of mature and caring information. I have given copies of this book to each of my children and I recommend it to all of the couples I see in marriage and family counseling. This is a book that can change your life and marriage for the best. It is as useful for women as it is to men.
1,Poorly written,Author repeats same thought several times. Author developed pages rather than content.
4,"Excellent,albeit short soundtrack","This is one of the MGM series of movie soundtracks that Rykodisc has recently released on CD.It features 13 songs written by Burt Bacharach with lyrics by Hal David.This film score fits the movie perfectly.There are 3 songs with vocals and 10 instrumentals.The highlight of the CD is the great vocal performance by Tom Jones on the title track.Other highlights are Manfred Mann's version of ""My Little Red Book"",which is vastly superior to Love's version that came a year later.The best instrumental is ""Downhill And Shady"",featuring some great electric guitar in the ""British Invasion"" style.This enhanced CD also has a funny 3 minute film clip from the beginning of the movie,where Peter O'Toole has his first therapy session with the deranged shrink played by Peter Sellers.I recommend this CD for anyone who liked the movie or the early days of the glorious British Invasion."
4,Maybe the archetypal 60s movie?,"When Mike Myers wrote the first Austin Powers script, surely he had to be thinking of two films of the 60s: ""Casino Royale"" and ""What's New Pussycat"". They're overwhelmingly silly, just a bit risque for the times, and make no sense whatsoever. Yes, there's always the suggestion of some sort of a plot, but nothing that would get in the way of the action. Whatever the story, pretty soon everyone is running around in circles chasing everyone else, great quantities of soap bubbles are coming out of womewhere, girls are losing bikini tops and a Bacharach and David song is playing in the background. What makes ""What's New Pussycat"" better than most is of course the contribution of a rather young Woody Allen to the script and the cast. It's inspired silliness and great fun."
5,What a Useful Tool,"With all the clutter on the Internet, this book really helped me hone in on getting to those sites which I really need to view and what's more, to get incredibly useful information, advice and products for free. Even more, the book is well organized and much easier to navigate than the Internet. If you surf the Internet daily, then you should keep this book right next to your key board!"
5,Great shoes!,"These sneakers are great! They look even better than the picture and they did not need any break in time. The shipping was very fast, considering I work in Egypt. But again, a very good buy."
5,excellent,"This was one of the first clinical identification and management articles written about child abuse. Expertly authored by a pediatrician with clinical illustrations, this symposia article from the late 1970's is still regarded as the gold standard for diagnosing and treating children who have been abused. Much of the work Dr. McNeese did as a renowned child abuse expert led to the attention that his disease receives today. The American Board of Pediatrics has now formed a board certified pediatric fellowship in child abuse so other physicians can get the training and knowledge to become authorities in this horrendous epidemic. A quick yet informative look at an unpleasant topic which affects all of us, either as parents or caregivers or healthcare providers."
5,The List,"All of the stories in this book are delightful but ""The List"" is by far our favorite. Who hasn't had a day like that?"
5,Great book for kids,My parents read this book to me as a kid and I loved it. It was one of the books that I'm sure was read over and over night after night. My mom and dad can probably still have this book memorized. :)
5,Frog and Toad for Grown-ups,"My daughters loved the Frog and Toad books and I always enjoyed reading with them. I purchased the book because of the story about planting a garden. It's PERFECT for new gardeners. I looked for it years ago when a good friend started gardening but couldn't find it. When my kids were reading Frog and Toad, they were short, individual books rather than several stories in one book. A young mother recently told me to look for the story in a larger book and I was able to find it. It's every bit as good as I remembered it. Great books for kids, good for grown-ups too."
5,For my grandson...,"I promised to send books every quarter to my grandsons in another state for their required reading, and this fit the bill entirely!"
2,Not what they advertise it to be...,"This year I purchased the ""New York Times Almanac,"" rather that ""The World Almanac,"" which I purchase every year. What a disappointment. On the cover they claim it's ""the world's most comprehensive almanac,"" but it doesn't have half the information that ""The World Almanac"" does. I've learned from my mistake. I buy an almanac so I can have all the information I need in one place. To my mind, an incomplete almanac like this one is a waste of money."
2,Better off with the World Almanac and Book of Facts,"Not a BAD reference book, but doesn't seem to have nearly as much info as the World Almanac."
2,Not as up to date,"I enjoy these types of almanacs a great deal but I was disappointed with the New York Times' offering. It uses information that doesn't seem as current as information in the ""World Almanac"" for instance. I also found it a bit disorganized."
5,A truly great work of fiction,This book is truly innovative. It gives us a view at the Aborigonies of Southern Djibouti. A must buy. Wright is a literal genius.
5,Nice two piece pan.,"Like the pan because it comes apart. Had a one piece before, and this is better. However, wish now I would have bought the non stick two piece angel cake pan. Maybe next time."
5,Love it!!,"On my first attempt at baking an angel food cake I was a success! Now I just keep finding excuses to bake cakes! It is so simple to use, very straight forward instructions. Thank you for such a terrific product!"
1,"Cheap, thin metal - tube insert very warped","The first thing I noticed when I got this pan home was that the tube insert was extremely warped. It was just shoddy workmanship and certainly showed little to no quality control. I also was surprised at how thin the metal was. It just looked and felt cheap. I hoped that wouldn't matter when baking a cake in it. After all, I told myself, Wilton is a well-known brand.After removing the cake from the pan, I saw that my concern about the warped insert was justified. The whole cake was tilted or crooked -- not something you'd want to serve to guests. After frosting it, it looked even more crooked.And when cleaning up the pan, I found that it was very scratched up after only one use. That was enough to convince me that I would be returning this pan."
1,"Awful quality, leaked everywhere","I purchased this pan since because I don't like the teflon coated ones, but it was incredibly poor quality. As some other reviewers have found, it didn't seal properly. Once it was in the oven it leaked everywhere. Even on a cookie sheet, most of the batter leaked out and burnt, which was terrible to clean. I'm not sure of the cause; perhaps slight warping that prevented a seal? Regardless, Amazon was wonderful and accepted the defective product back. I would definitely not purchase this."
2,Wilton angel food cake pan--JUNK,"I bought this wilton angel food cake pan and a cuisinart spring form pan from Amazon. The wilton pan was for my daughter. It came dented and warpped. For the price that is charged for the pan I find the quality cheap lousy junk. You would think that Wilton would sell better quality. Who do you blame for the pan being dented like that, wilton or Amazon or the person who packaged it. The cuisinart was in perfect condition and made strong, well worth the money."
5,3rd pan,"I bought one of this mini pan years ago, and just started to use it for a mini chiffon cake by splitting the batter from the big chiffon cake. I like the mini so much I bought a 2nd one and ended up given it away to my good friend. This is my 3rd pan so I have a pair for myself. This pan is perfect for mini chiffon, so cute and you can bake one for yourself and one to give away or freeze."
2,Don't use grease just use glue instead,"The pan is great but for an item that you don't grease for Angle Food the manufacture uses a glue for labels that doesn't come off. I've spent 45 minutes using hot water/soap , peanut butter and goo gone it won't come off the inside of the pan or the bottom of the pan even with scrapping. Once you bake in it with the glue you have a nice nasty brown spot. I will never buy another pan from Wilton with a glued in label."
1,Do you enjoy cleaning your oven?,"My old angel food pan rusted and when looking for a replacement I thought the idea to have feet on an angel food pan was great, so went with this... bottom leaked the very first time. Did try it again with a pan underneath, but still a mess. Now it sits in the far corner of my cupboard - a waste of money, a waste of time (cleaning my oven after angel food cake spilled all over), and a waste of space (soon it will unfortunately be a waste of space in a landfill... I am finally going to just throw it away)."
1,Leaked all over,This leaked all over the place the first time I used it. I even put a cookie sheet under it and the batter leaked all over it. Very disappointing.
4,Herb Mixtures and Spicy Blends,"While mainly a book of recipes of blends, the Introduction also contains good information on drying your own fresh herbs, seeds, and freezing fresh herb; as well as helpful information on storing herb mixtures. An added bonus is are helpful suggestions on packaging blends for gifts. There are recipes for appetizers, butters, dressings, no-salt blends, meat, seafood,traditional blends such as Italian, Pumpkin pie spice, bread and dessert blends; and some ""not so traditional"" such as ""Wassail Spice Mix"", for a punch. I especially like this book because after each formula there are suggested uses and a recipe using the blend. Each page also has a little history about where the blend comes from. Good Book!"
5,Successful Christmas Present,Purchased this for a grilling guru...he was very excited about the easy of making his own season mixes now instead of buying premix at the store.
3,herb mixtures & spice blends,i relly enjoy the recipes and trying them out. it is a nice to have the ideas and give them your own touch. would recomend to friends and people who like to know what is really in a spice mixture.
2,Not what I thought...,"Recipes call for too many ingredients, and make a lot. But, I was looking for single use dip mixes, like those sold at craft fairs."
4,"Cute, but boring","when my sister Annie first got this toy we read the paccage and thought that the toy would be sooooooo much fun but after a day we found out that all the toy does is sleep. He is cute but doesnt do much, but I guess that is how real newborn puppies are. I have a GO GO my walking pup and they have so much more action then the newborn puppy"
3,CUTE! CUTE! CUTE! but boring.,"when my sister and i bought this puppy it looked like sooooooo much fun. on the box it said "" if you pet the puppy it will become playful"". once we got it to work it was so cute but that was the only thing. it did not get playful all it did was move its head and make noise.and some times you have to pet it over and over again. all in all it is good for a little kid who does not get bored too quickly. but it was cute."
2,Snorelota,"Only in dedicated layering can this symphprog extend past so many of the cliches brazenly worn, rarely sustaining interesting structure before trailing off into carnival theatrics of the mediocre variety. I'm sure if you are a fan of this type of melodic metal grandstanding there is much fun to be found but so many of these types of projects are inherently gutted from the start, where flatly plastic production underscores persistently average ambition."
3,"not bad, but not great","Having followed the band for years, and owning all their albums to this point, when I heard a new SA album was coming, I was excited. Unlike some of the reviewers on this album, I loved Reckoning Night and hold it as the band's best work. And with songs like ""The Boy Who Wanted to Be A Real Puppet"" how could it not be? Alas SA released UNIA. I consider myself an open person when it comes to music and able to enjoy virtually all forms of it. But UNIA doesn't inspire me in the least. Tracks are boring and nothing stands out as a ""classic"" like in previous albums.It's not ""bad"", but it's far from ""great""."
2,Disapointed,"Im a big of them. Alot of the songs didnt go anywhere at werent catchy at all. There previous albums all were great. Theres nothing that comes close to The Cage, Full Moon among many others. Im glad i have Ecliptica coming in the mail after hearing this cd."
1,Warn Me Next Time,"I did not enjoy ONE song on this CD. It is always a bands' right to change direction radically, my wife does it all the time. But, at least (now) she warns me before she downshifts from 4th to 1st skipping the gears in between. If I wanted slow, moody, drippy vocals music I'd buy Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin (I know that dates me, but who cares, you get the idea). I have given 5 stars to every SA album they've made, and I have them all. I like the style they were and hope they return to it. Having said that I will wait next time to hear the samples and read the reviews before I order the CD."
2,yawn,Book dwells on the divide between men and women and between classes as seen in early 20th century. The perspectives were interesting but the plot draws yawns.
4,Very enjoyable,"This is the first book by Forster I've ever read and I enjoyed it a great deal.Forster takes the time to present a world to us while being explicit about what he is leaving out (the ""very poor""). In this book, the lives of the rich, the middle class, and the lower middle class collide. In the first part of the book, the collision is one of ideas and conversation. By the end of the book, it is quite physical and literal. This is the part of the book I enjoyed less, as it felt a bit too much like manufactured drama given the pages that preceded it.The themes of how we should approach the good fortune we inherit (and how we should treat others who have inherited differently) and how we can genuinely connect with other people are more applicable today than ever."
4,Better Than the Movie,"Surprise--better than the movie. I don't like this sort of movie much, but the book is fabulous."
2,Forced,"If you read this novel on your own (as in, it is not assigned to you as a form of assigned reading in school) then you will enjoy it because you obviously know what you're getting yourself into: whimsical dialogue between gossiping British ladies. I do realize how ridiculous and inaccurate this description is but I'm mad because I have been forced to read this book for school and I really hate it so therefore my opinion of it is very negative. Teachers should not force these types of books upon their students. The rate of enjoyment for this book is very limited to those who either teach English or have a keen interest in it. Very few students will be able to appreciate and enjoy this novel for its merits, of which I'm sure there are many.I do not expect this review to be helpful to anyone who is looking at this book as a means of pleasure reading."
2,A character driven novel where the characters don't deliver,"I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie. I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good. Not so with Howard's End. The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige. You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable. None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world. I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance. The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later. Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry. There definately is an audience for this book. I'm just not a part of it."
2,Try Passage to India instead,"The epigraph to the novel states ""Only connect..."" and the story is about how folks from different strata of society seem unable to connect & seem especially unable to make the connection between the morality of their class & that of other classes.That said, it is an excrutiating read. The characters are universally unlikeable, the story drags along and the lesson--about folks not obeying the morality they insist on for others--is obvious & not terribly important.GRADE: D"
2,Flat as a pancake.,"EM Forester was a gay, upper middle class Oxbridge graduate that lived in the Edwardian era. That is blatantly obvious in every word of his writing. This book, its story, and the characters make no emotional connection to the reader. I was thoroughly bored the entire time I was reading this. Also the redeemable characters are destroyed in the story and the ""heroes"" are horrible people. I could barely stand it."
3,Women have rights,"This book is a confused woman's rights saga.Personally, it is somewhat repulsive init's Victorian and anachronistic point of view.It most reminds me of Jane Austin in it's treatmentof social situations and romance.I don't think it is a good idea to encourageeither this or August Strindberg's attitudes toward women.We need a better approach."
1,Kindle edition,"My review is only for this free Kindle version. There are many little errors and I do not recommend downloading it. There are missing words, misspelled words, missing sentences, wrong words, etc. A couple of examples: ""Aunt Juicy"" instead of Aunt Juley, the bit of song that Jacky says when the character is introduced is missing, ""her began to mingle with his retreating thunder"" instead of ""her chirrupings began to mingle."" There's really no excuse for this and I'm tired of checking it against google books when I think something sounds weird."
2,A 4-star book but a 2-star paperback edition,"As fond as I am of this novel I cannot recommend this particular paperback Vintage edition. In a work so meticulous and richly crafted as _Howards End_, it's more than a little jarring to stumble across typos and spelling errors in the text. A handsome and attractive volume, such as we've all come to expect from Vintage, but those typos are really unforgivable. By all means read the book, but opt for a different edition."
5,Praising the beauty of Howards End.,"Howard's End is a book of supreme beauty. Forster has matered the subtelty of the English language and conveys his understanding of aural appeal in every sentence. Howard's End goes much further than merely examining the class strucutre of England. Forster probes into the nature of human existence and human love. He ventures intrepidly into the realm of the unseen, and the spiritual. And, produces a book of the utmost lyrical continuity and depth."
5,Clear thoughts and colourful characters,"I really liked this book, and I'm not surprised. I think there is something about the author, E.M Forster that I like. I think it is the way he expresses his thoughts, very clear and once you have read them and understood they are so obvious. ""How come I never thought of that"" entered my mind a few hundred times while I was reading this book. A lot about England and the English men and women is written in ""Howards End"" and the beautiful landscape is closely described.It is easy to get to know the characters and once you have done that it does not take long before you either love them or dislike them. The family that this book is about, has different opinions than the rest of the English people during these times. People consider them strange, but they are really just ahead of their time"
4,Social Change in Eduardian Times,"People don't care so much about manners any more (or perhaps don't have any) so novels of manners are quite unfashionable. Still, this book has a lot of insight into the social conflicts and changing mores of Eduardian England, carried by an interesting plot weaving together the lives of three socially very different families: two generations of the colonial capitalist Wilcoxes, three intellectual Schelegel siblings, and the lower class Basts. A young modern editor probably would be tempted to take out quite a few words but it is very readable for us older folks who are more comfortable with classic literarystyles."
2,"Beautiful prose, just not my cup of tea","I am writing this review weeks after finishing the book. So please excuse the generalization. Although I found the prose to be beautiful, the story line was slow moving. I understand this was written during a different era, so perhaps this would have been considered a page turner nearly a century ago. However, it was interesting to compare society's perceptions of infidelity and having a baby out of wedlock during Forster's time to those of today. Really, things are really not that different!"
3,"KINDLE EDITION: Flawed version, but readable","With my new iPad, I was very interested in downloading some ""freebies."" One thing I am very interested in is whether I should be downloading books with Kindle (the app) or iBooks (in iTunes).Well, both versions have pros and cons. For this book, I went iBooks.Both versions have identical text (I believe the text is from Gutenberg) but the formatting on both DRIVES ME CRAZY! My biggest complaint with the Kindle is the wide amount of space between paragraphs. Every paragraph is followed by TWO BLANK LINES. Even reducing the font doesn't make a difference...The iBooks version, however, doesn't use ""smart"" quotes and the dashes are merely two hyphens rather than the unbroken longer dash. (the 'm""dash). The paragraph indent space also varies, which drives me crazy too. It also seems like apostrophes are missing ..."
4,A book of human being!!,"I read ""Howard End"" about a month ago. I chose this book because of its attactive and classic cover which is out standing. I quite like it because the author had shown the real representation of British society that classified to upper, middle and lower class society. It has specific manner and life style which is absolutely different in each of the classes. The viewpoint of this book is to sympathize the poor, keep a promise, good deed procreate good returns and bad deed also procreate bad returns, which I have learnt so much from this book."
3,Very good for beginners but not cover essential points.,"This book teach you how to build a first level application for AutoCAD. You learn the basics: to develop your own custom entity, to register commands... But there is nothing about advanced features: deep cloning, COM features (OPM, Design Center...), relationships between objects..."
5,Excellent - especially for beginners,"I have several canning guides and this is, by far, the best. I was afraid to start canning until I bought this book. What makes this book so superior is there are photographs instead of illustrations. There are photographs detailing every step of the canning process, as well as photo examples of spoiled food (yuk!), prize-winning jars, equipment, etc. For beginners, there's a really easy, tasty spiced pear recipe they walk you through. There's a variety of recipes for jams, jellies, soups, sauces, salsas, chutneys, etc. And to top things off, there's an excellent chart at the back of the book that covers every type of food you can imagine along with its USDA recommendations. If you haven't canned before, and don't have a grandmom that can show you, this is the next best thing."
4,What a great book!,"I am new to canning, but not new to dabbling in the kitchen, so I felt it was time to learn. I ordered this book before the holidays so I would have time to read it thoroughly and learn to use my canner in time to give gifts to my friends for the holidays. I've been able to pick a nice variety of recipes so not all my friends receive the same item. There were a few helpful tips that weren't in some of the other canning books I read with explanations as to 'why'. I purchased a couple of canning books at the same time as this one and borrowed a couple more, but find myself coming back to this book the most!"
3,A good book for beginning canners.,This book is very thourough. The step-by-step instructions on what to do and what NOT to do are idiot proof. The book explains everything you would need to know to properly can foods. I recommend it for first time canners such as myself. The only downside-not many recipes. Also I only have a water bath canner and nearly half of the recipes are for a pressure canner. I did make some excellent Berry Jam from the book and it turned out perfect. (the first time too) A great book for beginners ready to dive in and can to their hearts content.
2,A book for people who want to make presents,"I just received my copy of this book, and I'm very disappointed. The text describing this book said it was filled with gourmet meals that can be home prepared and canned. This would be true if your idea of a meal is salsa, or jelly, or pickles. There are only a few soup recipes, and those contain no meat (and rarely beans). The book is pretty, and contains excellent hints on how to pack jars to win prizes (or, I guess, make fancy gift jars), but I'll have to look elsewhere for good chilis, stews, etc."
5,This great book is not about baseball --it's about Life.,"This is easily one of the best 5 books I've ever read. Although the book is obstensibly about the 1955 Brooklyn Dodger World Champions it is really about what happens to people (not just ballplayers) after they've reached their peak. The names are well known to anybody who follows baseball and one --Jackie Robinson-- to anybody who is familiar with American culture. Those names and their exploits are the hook, but what happens to the team members after their glorious victories are funny, sad, inspiring, depressing, poignant and always moving. Roger Kahn beautifully captures the sunsets of the lives of the people who were the '55 Dodgers. I'm a bit biased because I'm a lifelong Dodger fan (born in the year the Dodgers moved to L.A.) and I, of course, love baseball, but whenever I put down this book I felt I wasn't reading a ""sports"" book (a genre unfairly looked down upon). I was reading about Life. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."
4,"""Boys of Summer"" Enjoyable To The End","I have to admit that about fifty pages into this book I was sure it would be a book I would have to labor through. I thought the pace was slow and it was a little on the wordy side. Boy was I wrong. The book progresses from a boy telling stories about growing up near Ebbets, to taking you by his side while he followed his favorite team, and finally it allows you to realize that these players, heroes, were real people. The way Roger Kahn wrote this book was amazing. It feels as though you are in the room with him and staring into the eyes of legendary players. ""Boys"" will keep you glued to the pages all the while envoking every kind of emotion you have. Anger, sadness, happiness, disgust, love, and pain all rolled into 40 pages of a book about life with baseball serving as a backdrop."
4,Sublime sports treasure,"As an avid sports fan, I lack any real objectivity, but this is a beautiful tribute to the institution of baseball, focusing on one of the true glory teams from the glory days. Kahn's journalism exposes both the good and the bad, but his obivious admiration for the Brooklyn Dodgers explains why baseball has long been called America's Pastime. The exploits of Jackie Robinson, Duke Snider, Gil Hodges and company jump from the page and bring to life an amazing team when players actually cared who they played for and the loyalty to the team made a huge difference. We will never see days like these again in professional baseball; thankfully we can still experience them through remarkable books like this one."
2,Half a Good Book,"Roger Kahn has shamelessly used the attraction of the great Brooklyn Dodgers to lure people into reading what turns out to be his autobiography/confession/pyscho-therapy session. Instead of concentrating his entire effort on the great Dodger players of the 50's he exposes the reader to his own childhood of overbearing parents, sex-crazed housekeepers and personal issues of inadequacies. The half of the book that concentrated on the players was excellent, but with so much time wasted on his personal life that we as baseball fans have no interest in, it has been turned into a mediocre volume and definitely not for younger readers. If one can sort through the muck of his life story it may have value as a reference book, but otherwise it has very little to offer in the way of entertaining reading."
2,The Boys of Boredom,"I wanted to love Rogers Kahn's ""The Boys of Summer"". I wanted to get lost in the nostalgia of baseball, like rolling with the rhythm of a major league ball game on a hot summer's day. I wanted to revel in the writing, the insight, the exploration of the human condition through the tried and true sports metaphor vehicle of America's favourite pastime.Despite moments of insight and interest, I found Kahn's book to be plodding, self indulgent and mostly, lacking in soul. I have read many great books which use sports as the vehicle to ponder the universal truths, but, unfortunately, this was not one of them.To sum up in two words: boring and disappointing"
1,Very dissapointing,"If you are expecting an insightful potrait of baseball in 1950's Brooklyn look elsewhere. What this book delivers instead is a re-heated version of ""Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."" The author is so self-absorbed that any baseball lore one may find in the book must be washed down with a large dose of his syrupy personal saga. Along the way Kahn manages to drain all the vitality out of baseball and replace it with warm tapioca pudding."
4,"Boys of Summer, Yes -Kahn,no","Although I enjoyed the book, I'm sorry now that I spent the money on Mr. Kahn. Given Mr. Kahn's anti-American spew to the people in Cooperstown (a holy place!) on 4/9/03, I will refrain from buying his books for the rest of my life."
5,A Great Book!,"A great read, a great story about a game that is America itself. It is a book for those who love the game. In additon, it gives one insight into what those ball players went through while playing the game and after their playing the game was over. Truly, a book for the casual and for the devoted fan.Andrew"
5,Almost made me a Dodger fan,"Roger Kahn's ""The Boys of Summer"" stands as one of the finest works I have ever read. It might not be the greatest baseball book ever written, but Mr. Kahn does a masterful job of interweaving the lives of his beloved Brooklyn Dodgers with his own, creating a marvelous story that combines several classic themes: the coming of age of a young man, tragedy and triumph, the ephemeral nature of youth, and the universal struggle against age and death.This book is all of those, wrapped tightly in twine and covered in horsehide. I met a few new heroes the first time I read it, and I bring them back every few years for a fresh read and a reacquaintance."
3,underoath without the screaming,"another james paul wisener produced album (he seems to hand on this bands full length debut doing some guitar part here and vocal thing there). The album showcases earnest vocals and harmonies, big wall of sound guitars, and spirtual esque-lyrics. IT really sounds like underoath without the screaming. Its sprinkled with a few tasteful guitar parts and the gimicky keybaord effects that do at least a decent job of adding an atomspheric touch in songs like ""romance in denial"". ITs a pretty consistent album but like underoath its not paticularly. Though if anything its a little more accessible and the guitars are a little more melodic, but the distinguishing quality's arte few in between, the production helps alot for accessability. But its far too earnest, far too over produced. ITs kind of enjoyable, but its also a little monotnous"
1,Okay if you don't brush the hair,"My daughter asked for this for Christmas and she was very excited to use it. I agree with another reviewer that the eyeshadow does nothing in terms of changing color, but the other effects are interesting. Although the head and pup are cute, the hair is so poorly secured to the head that a light brushing --with the comb included in the toy --- removes the hair. So in my opinion this is the worst possible performance for a ""styling"" head. My daughter was very disappointed. I will be returning it."
2,Not much to it.....,"My 4 year old daughter begged for this for Christmas and Santa unfortunately delivered. This toy does not have any educational value, the eye shadow and hair are supposed to change color with warm and cold water but even that does not work that great. My daughter still plays with it a little bit but there is not much to hold her interest for more than a few minutes. It is used more as part of her room decor at this point. Will not recommend this toy, rather buy a regular Barbie doll."
3,Coloring changing does NOT work!,My daughter received this for Christmas. I didn't even know it was supose to change color's and she was so excited to find out it did. Well it doesn't work! You are supose to use very hot water (which for a child's toy is insane) and very cold water. It only gives you one nail polish bottle so you need to put the other water in a cup. We could not get anything to change on the doll AT ALL. We got the pup's nail polish to change but it dissapears and reappears so fast before we could even put on the right water. It is fun for the doll itself and doing her hair etc. But why didn't they test the doll to see that she doesn't change AT ALL!
3,A Little Dissapointed...,"The biggest reason why I chose this styling head for my Daughters is because of the color change feature that the make up is suppose to have. I felt that this feature is what set it above the rest since there are many styling heads to choose from. That, and the puppy that comes with it.I have to say that I am VERY dissapointed with the color change make up. I followed the directions exactly, and am yet to see any difference in the color of Barbies make up. The puppy has painted nails that have the color change option as well, and that is the only thing that I can get to change colors.So...this product only gets 3 stars from me since half of what it is suppose to do doesnt work!Im kind of bummed!"
4,"Concise, but not complete","I often use my dictionary and wanted a small one to take along when I travel. This one sounded about right. However, on my last trip I found that the definitions are limited and not necessarily what I'm looking for. For the size and the price, it is satisfactory, but it doesn't compare with a full-sized dictionary."
4,Off Center Patchwork,This book is really neat - taking traditional blocks and making them into other different type of quilts. gives new light on quilt making
3,Neil begins to branch out.,"In this last album, The end of the ""Enz"" is a major theme throughout the album. Without, his brother Tim on this album, Neil begins to experiment with sounds, styles and lyrics, sometimes with success or times not. What is noticeable is the underlying ""Crowded House"" direction that is starting to evolve. Also, worth the buy is the song ""I Walk Away"", which is found re-done on 1986's ""Crowded House"". Here you get the wonderful Split Enz stamp to it."
3,5 good songs,"The first five songs are decent Neil Finn tunes, the rest are filler mainly written by the others members of the band. The first five songs get 5 stars, the rest 1 star so it evens out to 3 stars."
2,so so,"Give this book 2 stars because it has good general info; its ok for the most part; accurate info for someone who doesn't know a thing about Occupational Therapy. I gave this book a chance figuring it would have additional information regarding this profession, but for the most part you don't need to buy this - you can always find everything on the internet. Still if you don't want to do the research, purchasing this is a good decision and for $10, its pretty cheap."
1,Small fit,"For a big and tall pant, this is an awful fit. I wear a 44W x 34L, so I was glad to find that Amazon carried Docker's in this size. Saves a trip to the mall. Price seemed good. When I got these pants I was very disappointed. While the fit in the waist and length were tight on, the butt and the thights were sized like a skinny jean a teenage boy might wear. Not at all the fit I was expecting. Very misleading. I have bought the ""signature"" khaki through JC Penney in their stores tons of times so I thought I was getting the same thing with a nice comfortable fit, you know, the things dockers are know for. I was really disappointed that amazon would not reimburse the shipping saying that incorrect fit is not their problem. I told them it was a case of incorrect descriptions, but they didn't care. How the hell did they win for best customer service a couple years ago? I don't see it. Don't buy these unless you a tall fat guy who wants a really tight pair of pants."
2,Not what I expected,"I expected the same Dockers I've been buying for years. These are not them. The waist doesn't close with a button. It closes with a hidden button and a hook. It's more like dress pants. The color I got is called ""cloud"" which makes me think white. I have several older pairs that I think of as white. The color is more like a light-khaki instead. And finally, there is a piece of elastic in the left and right sides so that the waist can expand. I've never seen such a feature on Dockers and don't like it. It makes the pants too loose and they don't hold my shirt tail in. I can cinch up the belt but then it looks all pleated at the waist. The delivery was not a problem but these were the only available Dockers I could find in 40x36 anywhere on Amazon and they don't have the features I wanted. I already washed them and its too late to return or I would."
3,Slim fit in spite of elastic waist,"I bought these because I thought they were the same as others in my closet that needed replacing. Dockers, same size, same elastic waist, but to my surprise these are a slimmer fit through the thighs than I expected."
1,A Siberian prison factory could make better pants,"Bought a size larger than I am, pants were loose in the waist, but looked like skinny jeans on my thighs. I didn't have time to return them, so I just wrote them off and ordered WAY larger. Legs fit, waist could fit an elephant. However, after two weeks both pairs are already falling apart. The pocket seems have split, and they both have random holes that Remind me of rotting canvas. They also wrinkle if you look at them. I have never owned a fabric that wrinkles so quickly.DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PANTS. The size doesn't matter, the style doesn't matter, they are all absolute garbage. Dockers used to be a quality brand, now they are even pants fit for the homeless."
2,Bad pants construction,"As you can review my purchases with you they are quite a few and never have I complained because there was no reason. Sadly there is always a first time, the Dark Khaki pants I bought at the part where it streches the cloth ripped open, this happened on both sides and I was very very surprised, I tried to put them on once and that was when it happened, I took it to a tailor to fx them but told me the cloth was rotten, pudrid.I want to know with my record with you can you please send me no charge a new pair of pants, if you send them to me I will be able to return the ones I have in the package you send me the new ones if you want me to return them, I have already spent $20.00 trying to fix them but with no success.Please let me know your feed back. I wrote a few days ago to the packaging division with no answer up to know.I hope I have better luck with you.With kindest Regards,Jules Garcia"
5,Looking good,"Bought these slacks as a ""Just Because"" gift for someone special to me. He tried them on and the slacks look great on him. Was purchased for him as work pants but he say they are to nice to work in. We both are very happy with the quality and looks of them. I'm thinking about ordering another set for him."
1,pour seem,i didnt evan last 20 min in the. as soon as i put them on walked down stairs and sit hdown they split right down the middle. i still have them but dont know if i can exchange or not
1,Arrived torn,"Much to my disappointment, these pants arrive with elastic band torn out of them; I have had to take to local cleaners to repair the band= $20.00 cost out of pocket; I was going to order two more pair, but have canceled said order!!!"
1,Stretch waistband poor design,The stretch waistband is the worst design in 15 years of wearing Dockers. Had to sew it closed to stabilize the waistband. Shirt wouldn't stay tucked and waistband stretch mechanism tended to fail. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CATASTROPHE OF POOR DESIGN!
1,I think they are counterfeit,"These Dockers are very poorly made of low quality material.Of four pairs that I purchased two pairs were unwearable after the first use.I have several pairs of Dockers that I have worn for more than ten years and don't recall ever having a seam failure. I have experienced a belt loop tearing out, but this was after many years of normal wear.I ordered these items from my Amazon order history as direct replacements of those received from earlier ordersThe problems with the new pants occurred the first or second time I wore them. One pair these new pants have ripped out at the seam and the other ripped from the waist line to the back of the knee away from any seams.I don't believe that the pants I received were made by Dockers even though they had the Docker labels."
1,"These are comfort fit waist pants, and it is not stated in the description anywhere!","Come on Amazon, get with the it and put up decent description!These are not your standard Dockers!They are the comfort wait which unless you know what it is you will most likely hate it."
5,"Excellent fit, quality.","I've ordered a number of these khakis. They look good, fit well, are sturdy, long-lasting pants, and are reasonably priced."
2,Elastic Waistband Ruined It For Me!,"Long-time Dockers fan, wearing 38x36 khakis. ""Modern waistband"" is not an accurate or complete description of an elastic, poorly designed panel for those with roller-coaster waistlines. For me this feature detracts from the fit. I have had the same waistline for over thirty years and don't need elastic for a fit--elastic that will likely create problems over time without adding value. I returned my order with regrets that Dockers had ruined the fit that I have enjoyed for so long. Pants otherwise were the same old Dockers that I have grown to appreciate. Now I have to look elsewhere for a proper fit."
2,"Returned them, way over priced, not the high quality I expected.","I returned the 2 pair of Dockers for a refund. The material was not worth the expensive price tag, even on sale. I found a higher quality pant from another brand for about a third of the price. Much happier. Amazon was great to work with however."
2,Pretty Bad...,"Bad Religion is my favorite band. Ever. That being said...I bought this CD because I had money and this was the only BR CD in the store. When I listened to it, my CD player's batteries were low, so I could only listen to eight or nine songs before it turned off.THANK GOD! It was hard to listen to nearly all of them. I know I have to listen to the rest, but it'll be a struggle getting me near that CD ever again. The lyrics weren't too bad, but the melodies were too slow and so NOT Bad Religion. (I read the lyrics to A Street Kid Named Desire, and I thought I'd like it, but it was slow and... awful.) The only song that didn't make me want to press ""Skip"" is I Love My Computer, and even then I was tempted, namely because of the melody.Do not, I repeat, DO NOT waste your money on this. Get something else. Anything."
3,"A few good songs, but it doesn't stand up to other BR albums","This album has it's good points. ""You've Got a Chance"", ""The New America"", and ""Don't Sell Me Short"" are classics; however, the rest of the album is mostly filler material. This album is decent, but it doesn't compare to previous Bad Religion albums. If you are new to Bad Religion, start with their older material and work your way up to this one."
3,"Ignore the ""professional"" reviewers...","This album doesn't get 3 stars compared to other bands out there, because why waste time comparing BR to anyone else? This album does get 3 stars compared to their previous albums. I don't get what all the hype about this album is for?!? After The Gray Race, I was really happy to read that ""Bad Religion is back on top with the best songwriting and lyrics since..."" whatever. I found one track on here I really like, ""A Street Kid Named Desire"". The rest feels really drab to me. If you're a big BR fan, don't hold your breath over this one if you don't already own it. BR's still the best, but this album's not close to theirs..."
4,Best since Stranger Than Fiction,"After the post-Mr. Brett disappointments of The Gray Race and No Substance, Bad Religion comes back with a vengeance to prove that they can still come up with hard-driving, catchy, well-written songs and are more than just the elder statesmen of punk rock. You've Got a Chance may very well be one of the best BR songs ever and starts the album out on an aggressive note. The Hopeless Housewife and the title track New America are other high points, and the Mr. Brett collaboration Believe It reminds listeners just what the band lost when he left. But on the whole Graffin wrote a great album that inspires hope that BR has a lot of good music left in them."
3,I dunno....,"This CD has some problems especially evident on the first listen...but it does grow on you. The lyrics are positive, which isn't a big problem, except that they aren't written well. I think Bad Religion needs to leave the ""we can make a difference"" stuff to Pennywise. After a good, but somewhat awkward opening with ""you've got a chance"" the cd descends into oblivion and never really recovers until the ninth song. Bad Religion proves they CAN still write a song with the excellent ""Hopeless Housewife"" and ""don't sell me short,"" but ultimatly this still pales in comparison to classics like against the grain, generator, and no control"
3,"Good, but they are straying from what BR used to be.........","Bad Religion has been one of those bands around forever. They were the inventors of ""Thesourus Rock""- but the ""New America"" strays from what BR used to be. Back in the good ole' days, BR's songs we're all under 2 minutes now they are all under 4 minutes. They have strayed from the big words and complex phrases in their lyrics, and they aren't what they used to be. Don't get me wrong, ""New America"" is a great CD, but it's not the Bad Religion I know and love. Brett Gurewitz (ex-BR lead guitarist) is back for one song, but even he can't restore the magic. Where did you guys go? Key Tracks: ""You've got a Chance"", ""Believe It"" (w/ Gurewitz), There Will be a Way"", ""Let it Burn"", and ""Don't Sell Me Short""."
3,Chicken Soup For the Punk Rock Soul,It's a batch of songs as subtle as soft money and as adult-contemporary slick as anything Diane Warren or Richard Marx ever penned.
3,Now all BR fans can agree the band has sold out. :(,"I consider myself a die-hard BR fan. I don't like the term ""sell out"", and it probably doesn't accurately describe their latest effort, because no single song stands out as radio material. I hate to say it, because they've been my favorite band for so long, but I feel that they just don't speak to me anymore. With songs like ""I Love My Computer"" or ""The Hopeless Housewife"", I find myself wondering just who they think their audience is.The title track ""New America"" pales when compared to other critiques of the USA such as ""American Jesus"".This CD is only for the optimistic BR fan who wants to hope for the best, hear the CD and make up their own mind."
1,Really bad,"When I got this album I was excited beacause just 2 days b4 I bought stranger than fiction (which by the way is a great BR album) and I own the process of belief and the empire strikes first which are great albums, but when put the new america into my cd player I couldnt stand it it was horrible it sounded nothing like BR's other albums it slower and less uhh rocking it is just a bad album there is not one good song on it."
3,"not bad, but not compelling","This is the first BR album that I listened to once and didn't think- I have to listen to it again, immediately.Have I listened again? Yes- but I find this album less compelling than previous efforts. So far favorites are Streetkid, I Love My Computer, and There will be a Way. But then there are tracks that I really dislike- A World Without Melody is this album's Shiny Happy People- an annoying jingle that prompts an immediate pass-over from the remote control.Was I hoping for No Control or Suffer all over again- you betcha. Do I expect every album to be there, nope- BR will evolve just like each of us. Still I find The New America to be a turn for the worse- If you're don't own aforementioned NC or Suffer or even No Substance, Grey Race (which are both great albums in their own right), buy those first."
4,A return to form,"After the inconsistency of The Gray Race, and the pop-rock stylings of No Substance, this is a refreshing return to form. Not that their previous 2 albums were bad, just sub-par. So how does this one stack up? Well, take the better, hard-charging moments of The Gray Race, and marry them to the pop sensibilities of No Substance. Then increase the production values sightly and add in a few subtle diversities, and you have A New America. It reminds me of Recipe For Hate. Not as raw as Stranger Than Fiction, but more to the ""punk"" side of the fence than No Substance. It's a more mature BR, and a very consistent effort. It won't make you forget No Control or Against The Grain, but it might make you forgive them for The Gray Race and No Substance."
2,really uninspired...,I hate to say bad things about one of my favorite bands...but this album by BAD RELIGION is really uninspired and kinda POP...this one and the lame NO SUBSTANCE are the worst stuff BAD RELIGION done...The band really missed Mr. Brett....
4,PRETTY GOOD STUFF,ILL ADMIT IM NOT A HUGE BR FAN I ONLY OWN 3 CDS INCLUDING THIS NEW ONE AND IT SOUNDS TO ME TO BE A GREAT ALBUM CONSISTANT WITH THE TWO I HAVE. ID STILL HAVE TO RECOMMEND GENERATOR TO ANY VIGIN BR PEOPLE
2,Eh... Yea the Label Says Bad Religion,"I went out this sunday and bought The New America at a store and quickly threw it into the player in hopes to hear tunes like modern nam and no control but instead I was disapointed by the toned down selection of music that played out of the earphones. I've been listening to BR for a few years now and this is by far their least impressive album. If you want some sweet punk sounds then buy ""All Ages"" and wait till their next release comes out, hopefully with more upbeat music that will remind us of when we all bought our first Bad Religion cd and used it so much that our cd player died."
3,flying to the heights of raging mediocrity,"I did not hate this album. I am a major fan of BR and think that this is a decent CD. Yet were I given the choice to listen to ""no control"" or ""suffer"", i would pass this one up without batting an eyelid. The songs seem to lack a certain BR style quality. The guitar is a bit more complex than the simple power chord progressions that they have done in the past, but it comes with a price. The vox have kind of an annoying reverb effect the whole time and Greg Gaffin just sounds incredibly different. The overall tone is a bit more ""pop-ish"" and makes this album a very mediocre effort. Good for anyone who listens to BR and has a fairly open mind, but if you're just getting started, get ""suffer"" instead. Nevertheless, the best songs are ""I love my computer"" and ""It's a long way to the promised land"""
3,BR Have Lost The Plot.,"As much as it hurts me to say this, I am going to anyway; this is not a good BR album. Bad Religion have gone from one of the most influential punk rock bands of all time to a radio-friendly, pop-rock band, not that that's bad on its own, but when you add in an element of...I don't know...cheesiness, for lack of a better word, it just becomes annoying. Hearing some of the songs was almost depressing, and when you hear the few good songs on the album, ""Don't Sell Me Short"", and ""There Will Be A Way"", in particular, both of which are BR at their best, you get more depressed when you remember what they are capable of but have failed to produce for the rest of the album. Many other songs had potential, only to be covered with a thick layer of cheese and ruined. I'm all for the band trying something different after 20 odd years, but they are heading in the wrong direction. This is still not a bad punk rock album, but they can do much better."
3,Bad Religion for MTV,"In these days, where there is no big world crisis going on somewhere on our globe, Greg Graffin doesn't seem to have anything to be angry about or to critizise. If not for Graffin's unmistakable voice I wouldn't have recognized the rather poppy und optimistic tunes as Bad Religion's work. Also, the pace is considerably slower compared to all other albums, probably to make the songs longer, and the lyrics are simple enough so that even I, speaking English as a second language, can understand them without using my dictionary (in my opinion this as bad). I hope Bad Religions next album will have some more punch again. Only buy this album if you want to complete your BR collection or something like that, to anyone else I would recomend BR's ""Against The Grain"" or the more recent ""No Substance"""
1,ever band has one bad album,and this is it....this is just real bad....im mean burn it and forget about it bad....
1,Not as good as people say it is!,I have been a BR fan for over 15 years now and this is by FAR their worst album next to 'Recipe for Hate'. The lyrics to the songs are in fact great but the melodies are just not up to par. It seems like the songs on the album start off well but the rest of the way seems like there's just no substance. There really is only two or three good songs on this CD (Hopeless Housewife & 1000 Memories) and those songs are not the best BR has to offer. I'm very dissapointed and I hope the next album will be a lot better.
2,One man's observations on the history of European art,"This book is one man's random observations on some aspects of European art mostly from 15th to 19h century.The title is indeed misleading. The book does not cover the history of civilization, western civilization or even history of western art. Many of these random observations are downright silly and mass-pleasing in my opinion. It is quite gossipy as it gets into private lives of artists and tries to make conclusions about their art based on assumptions about their inner lives. The truth is that we cannot fairly judge people and their art based on simple biographical facts known from their lives. Freud's incorrect views of the human mind influenced many people's ways of thinking including Kenneth Clark's. I never saw the TV series so my judgement is solely based on what I see in the book."
3,Not about civilization,"I would give this book five stars if its title were ""The Story of Western Art"" or ""Art and the Soul of Western Civilization"" or some such. I was fooled by the title into thinking that this was a grand overview of Western Civilization, a kind of short version of ""The Story of Civilization"" by the Durants. I was bitterly disappointed that the book was not at all about its title. It's a brilliant review of the art of Western civilization and what it tells us about the ethos of that civilization through the course of time. Although I am not much interested in the history of western art, I nevertheless found the book rather interesting. I would enthusiastically recommend this book to anybody who is interested in the history of western art. I'm not interested, so the book was a disappointment to me."
3,sent it back,"Quality seemed okay, functionality not so much. We knew it wasn't spiral bound, but didn't realize how tight the binding is. It really interferes with drawing. Also, we felt like the description was incorrect. The navy blue is BLACK. We did a test with household objects just to see if there was any blue in there...."
1,One size does not fit all!,"Claimed it was for people 14 and over, but it was way too small, and I don't have a big head. I'd recommend only for small children."
4,A really good record,"As a fan of Wilco, I've followed the boys back to Uncle Tupelo (I'm currently infatuated with Anodyne) and forward to this one. Very enjoyable, particularly if you like Jeff Tweedy's songs, and really you ought to. ""Fear of Falling"" and ""Lost Love"" are great songs, and ""Please Tell My Brother"" is so beautiful that I got my guitar out immediately to learn it. Not every song is great, but the good ones really stick in your head."
3,"OK if you feel compelled to own everything by Tweedy, Louris","Don't be too fooled by the cast of heavy-hitters; this is a very average album. It doesn't have the sound of a fresh collaboration. Rather, it is made up of what sounds like some decent outtakes from the members' regular gigs."
2,So-so,"A decent sophomore effort by the Smog, but still not great. If you are new to Golden Smog, get the most recent album first and work back. Otherwise, you will not like what you hear at all."
4,Don't Let the Cheezy Cover Fool You,"These guys are great. All three of their albums are worth adding to your collection, especially if you are a fan of Buffalo Springfield/Byrds country rock."
3,Just average considering the talent,"I am a huge fan of Wilco and Jayhawks ( not so much Soul Asylum). I am often skeptical of collaborations like this, but I had read many reviews that this Golden Smog album is the great exception to the rule. After a number of listens, nothing seems outstanding though little is terrible. The Tweedy songs are the weakest. Not nearly as good as Jayhawks or early Wilco from the same period.I do grant that the CD cover is great and a good conversation starter."
4,This smog is a breath of fresh air,"Just recently picked this one up sight unseen, and am very pleased. A traditional yet fresh sound, with simple but solid songwriting. Sounds like Mick Taylor-era Stones crossed with the Smithereenes, infused with perhaps a small dose of Cracker. It also in spots reminds me of the early 70's Hugh Nicholson band Blue. And the packaging art paying homage to one of the greatest fiction mags in American history is designed to catch the discerning eye. Very likeable effort that shows a lot of promise for development."
4,Their first true album!,"With Weird Tales, Golden Smog evolves from a bunch of guys doing whatever sounds fun to making a true album. Mind you, I enjoyed Down By the Old Mainstream immensely... but Tales has a cohesiveness that their first release didn't. There doesn't seem to be as much filler, and it truly does seem to combine the best of Wilco, the Jayhawks and Run, Westy, Run. Plus, it's always great to see that Jody Stephenson's getting a paycheck!"
1,RIP-OFF,Un-believably poor quality re-mastering! The quality was so poor that I thought they where Chinese bootleg knock-offs. Is this some sort of a scam?
1,Defective Product,Purchased this set as a Gold Box deal. Some deal - the 1st disc I pulled out and examined had a glue streak running across the side of the disc. Didn't even look at the other discs just boxed it up and returned the set. And I'm a Eastwood fan too - really hate not having this set.
1,Buyer Beware,"Very Disappionted. The dvd's skipped right out of the box, some so bad that it couldn't be watched. Most discs had glue or some type of hard build up on them. Others had scratches. For the money I expected something that would last for at least a few veiwings, but I couldn't even watch some once. To remove and replace the discs from the package force must be used. I guess so they won't fall out, but this is excessive. They should have came up with a better design. You would have better luck buying used dvd's, at least those are expected to have the possiblity of scratches. Don't buy it."
1,Do Not Buy This - Rip Off,Clint is great - so are his movies. The DVD's in this poorly packaged set were scratched. They are double side DVD's and you are unable to pull them from their over-glued sleeves without touching both sides of the DVD - possibly scratching them even further. You can't return them to Amazon since you opened the package.
3,book case,The case the movies came in are very hard to get out without out scratching them up.I was suprised you did not catch this.
2,Very disappointing,I bought two of these sets for my husband and father in law who are huge Eastwood fans a year ago. I can tell you neither has watched any of the movies. The packaging is such that the movies are crammed together in one tiny package in a way that makes it a completely annoying process.
1,paid for the movie set but never received it,"Kind of hard to post a reveiw of the movie set when I never received it. Please keep in mind that my credit card was charge the day after placing my order and I placed my order on Dec 7, 2010. I was hoping that the movie set would arrive by Christmas since it was suppose to be a present for my husband. When Dec 30 rolled around and the movie set still hadn't arrived I made an effort to contact the vendor. Do you think they responded - NO they didn't. I sent another email on Jan 5 and still NO response from the vendor. Finally I contacted Amazon stating that I never received the movie set and that I wanted my money back. Amazon was quick to respond and I received a full refund. Thank you Amazon for looking out for your customers."
3,Years of Clint Eastwood Movies,"I purchased this Boxed set for husband and although the reviews did comment on the packaging, I went ahead and purchased it anyway.Well the reviews were correct unfortunately.Love the different movies that are in the set, but the packaging is very poorly done.DVD's do not have titles of the movies on any of the disc's??"
3,Poor Packaging,"I have been a long term Eastwood fan. When I saw the product advertised I thought it would be a good addition to my DVD library. However, reading about the packaging has convinced me not to purchase. Want to thank individuals for being candid."
1,unplayable flippers = ripoff,"I bought this a week ago and have watched 5 movies. The first four all had multiple corrupted zones and the fifth doesn't even load. At all. I am going to have to reboot the machine to get the dvd out. This set has good movies in it, but you won't be able to see them with this box set. Total ripoff. Worst Amazon experience ever."
3,Not all Clint movies,"We were a little disappointed that all of Clint's movies weren't on here. But the ones that are on it, are good to watch again. Even a few movies we had not seen that he did not star in, which were good."
3,"Great movies, Lousy packaging.",We took all of the dvd's out of the package and put them in our own DVD case because it is so difficult to get the dvd's out of the case that they came in. It isn't worth risking damaging the dvd's trying to take them out and returning them to the case that the dvd's are packaged in.
4,clint eastwood collection,very well packaged but shame the spaghetti westerns not in this collection. enjoying the harry callahan movies though.
3,"Thank you, everybody...","When I saw this collection, I took stock of my own personal library and wondered if getting this amazing collection at an amazing price (yes, for 35 films it IS a bargain)... But thanks to the few reviews I've read thus far, I am better off holding on to the DVDs I have and continuing to get the Blu-Ray transfers as they come out. Oh, well..."
2,"Boss has this, but I don't think I'd care to own it","It's a neat looking binder, but the disks are double-sided and can't help but be messed up - I advise you to remove them PERMANENTLY and put them in plastic cases or lined sleeves. Disappointed that the Spaghetti Westerns are absent, but the stupid monkey movies are there. Also, Kelly's Heroes is a low-brow movie at its worst. (I know, I know...this is Hollywood product, not something directed by an Italian filmed in Spain and edited by a Greek and a Portuguese...with really loud, obnoxious vocal grunts passed off as Old West soundtrack.) How about a Dirty Harry, Death Wish and Die Hard bundle? Happy New Year 2012!!!"
4,CHRISTMAS PRESENT,GREAT COLLECTION OF A CLASSIC SIERES. THIS SET IS AWSOME ALL OF THE BEST MOVIES THAT CLINT HAS EVER CREATED.
2,Lousy packaging,I won't try to rate the movies as most people already know what they think. I want you to know about the lousy packaging. The discs are tight inside a cardboard sleeve with 2 movies per disc. It is impossible to take them out without fingerprints on your discs. They are labeled with print so small you'll need a magnifying glass to read it. There is no way you'll handle these discs over a period of time without scratching them. The outside sleeve is so flimsy it will soon be split. Really a cheap way to present this set. Thirty-five movies for this price is a good value but plan to put the discs into your own cases or sleeves with your own labeling.
1,Awful packaging what was the studio thinking,"As a fan of the older Clint Eastwood, I bought this collection to explore some of his earlier works. This collection is packed into a large book so big it will not fit on a shelf so that it was impossible not to place the films in a container. The films are unlabelled so you have to use a large guide to figure out which film it is, I am not reviewing any of the films because the presentation of this major contributor to cinema because to hard to figure out. Shame on the studio for releasing this bargain release.. I would much prefer paying twice as much for well presented 35 disk set NOT Recommended"
2,Poor packaging/selection of films,Please read the feedbacks before purchasing this package. Several of his films are not included and some six year old probably designed the packaging. One film on each side and each side has smudges when retrieving for play. This boxed set is not for the serious movie buff or collector. Amazon should be ashamed.
3,Expensive,"I was looking for this set for a Christmas Gift. Unfortunately 1 week after I ordered it, I found it for half the price at our local COSTCO! By then my order could not be cancelled. How disappointing to have paid such a high price."
5,always liked clint eastwood,My wife bought this for me for christmas. I always loved clint eastwood movies. I have watched several I missed. Even though I know some are not my type of movie the documentary inside was greater than expected. I would suggest you buy this if you like to own some movie history.
5,Excellent representation,"Excellent representation of Clint Eastwood's work, both as an actor and as a producer. Most enjoyable to watch his growth in the film industry"
1,"good product, never again from this seller.","didn't receive the product on time and I paid extra for expedited shipping...emailed seller a day before asking details and to this day never received a response. I took a chance on a seller that was brand new. Never again!!!! People were complaining that the product was ""cheaply made."" It isn't THAT bad, but maybe not worth being over a hundred bucks. They also complained about the discs being double sided, but how else would you be able to create a box set with so many movies? My husband loved it either way."
5,eastwood rocks,"This product was completely sealed and brand new just as described. It was the same product that is on the previews to other movies which was what I wanted. Very happy with this purchase, it was 20 dollars less than in the stores."
1,Haven't received it yet.,"Good Books Quick is not a place I would order from again. ""Their name of the company should be ""good Books No so fast or NOT at all""!I ordered the item on May 21st and was promised it by June 15th. I still haven't received it. I have emailed them (the seller) several times to ask about it but, with no reply. I'm still waiting.... The present was going to be for my husbands 50th birthday because he is a huge Clint Eastwood fan. ;-( . In the past when I have ordered through Amazon I have ALWAYS received the item within 2 days (I wish I would have ordered directly through Amazon this time)."
3,disappointed,"I wish a full list of the movies had been featured prominately in the ad. I would have liked titles on the cd showing the name or a large number tied to the table of contents. Missed a ""spaghetti western"""
3,already own,I love the idea of this collection. However as a long time fan I already own most of the films. Can't see buying this set if they are already in your collection. Great idea for new collectors.
2,spanish subs?,I need to know if there are spanish subs for all the movies. Also if they are dubbed into spanish. It would be great to know. Thanks. I hope somebody can answer before the deal finish.
3,Adam Cheng shows off his fan style in this one.,"Adam Cheng stars in this one not Roc Tien as the movie sleeve would suggest, and all the pics on the back do not actually appear in the film but none the less it is still a classic film. Some impressive and creative fights, and a lot of blood make this a very entertaining movie."
4,Really soft,"These towels were not very absorbent at first, but after a few washes, they are much better. They are so nice a big; I love it! My only complaint is that there appears to be bleach blotches on them after a few washes. I do not use bleach in my laundry, so I am not sure what happened to them. They are great towels anyway!"
2,Looks over function,"Purchased this bath towel last year from a brick and mortar store. It looks great; definately soft and luxurious to the touch. I did not purchase these towels for looks but because of the advertised ""Hydro Cotton"" which claims to suck up water quickly and efficiently. After repeated washing without using fabric softner on them, they just do NOT dry off the body thoroughly! I can use the towel during the summer when drying off after a shower is not a problem but used it several times during the winter after a shower and burrrr...! I also noticed that when towel drying the body, the water tends to stay at the tips of the cotton loops so as the drying process is continued, the water seems to transport slightly onto different parts of the body which makes it a very cold process during the colder months. I would not recommend this towel."
4,This towel is HUGE!!!!,I give it four stars instead of five because it's HUGE....I think this towel will be great in the winter to wrap up in but now for the summer the regular size towel is perfect. Luckily we bought both sizes. Wish they would restock the colors tough...not much left to choose from....
1,Lint Galore! Returned these towels.,"I ordered 4 of these towels and had high hopes based on the limited amount of reviews I found. I had actually checked them out at my local bed, bath store before purchasing them from Amazon to ensure they felt good. And they did. The only problem was the incredible amount of lint they gave off during each washing. I put them through the wash 3 times before contacting Amazon for a refund. Did I get a bad batch? Guess I won't really know. I was disappointed."
1,Not Good,"I bought two sets of these towels. One of the sets faded immediately upon the first use. The towels have a good feel, but do not dry a person especially well. That alone would have been tolerable, but the fading is a deal killer. Fading occurred while in use, before even washing for the first time.Would recommend you take a pass on these and pay a bit more for nicer towels that will last."
3,Pills and lint,"I purchased a navy blue J-class Nautica towel because of its advertisement about being so soft and able to wick up water. I haven't noticed any difference with its ability to dry better than other towels. It definitely is softer than other towels; however, I am embarrassed to have it hanging in my bathroom. Ever since the first washing (it has only been washed about 4 times), there have been huge pills all over it. I am continuously cleaning blue lint out of the bathtub, off the floor, and off my body. If you are looking for a soft towel, and do not care about constant lint and the look of the towel, then this towel would be a good buy for you! If you care about the other aspects, look elsewhere!"
1,Develop Big Holes When Washed,These Towels develop big holes when washed. Avoid like the plague. Big Rip Off!
2,NOt Pleased with nautica hygro bath towel,Wanting a good set of matching towels i shopped around and decided on the Nautica brand. I didn't know much about different quality of cottons for bath towels but remembered Nautica being a well-known brand for water sports and went with them. They seemed quality and plush in the store but since I've gotten them home they shed constantly. I've now washed them three times and a good amount of lint comes out of the drier so I think i'm getting most of it...but NOOO . Everytime I dry off more lint comes off onto me and I have to use another one of my old towels to effectively get dry...and clean. [...]. I'm tired of the towels copious sheddings & I want to take all of them back!
4,Very fluffy towels,"Overall I like these towels a lot because they are so fluffy and soft. They do expand after the first wash. The one drawback is that the fibers are constantly shedding and I wonder when it will stop. Six washes so far, and I am still getting tons of towel lint in my hair and clothes."
1,No good as a towel,"The Nautica bath sheet makes many claims. Softer and fluffier after every washing...maybe; but as a towel, it is a failure. Its absorbency claims are overstated, in fact, they are pure fantasy. Toweling off with one of these bath sheets is akin to trying to dry oneself with a wet towel. The experience is most uncomfortable, damp and chilly. My 10 year old Castle bath sheets are FAR superior to these bad boys.Our cat enjoys Nautica bath sheets as warm and fluffy bed liners."
2,Pills and Pulls,"I was disappointed with the quality of these towels. I bought four because they were part of the four-for-three promotion. After washing and drying them, they came out of the dryer with pilling and stray threads. If I had bought them for other than use in a kid's bathroom, I would be pretty irked. I did read the reviews(mixed) before I bought them, so I can't claim to be totally ignorant. I'm hoping they improve with age like one reviewer mentioned. The bottom line: If you're buying these towels for a guest bathroom, or it's important that they look really nice, you should pass on these."
2,Plush and soft but doesn't absorb,"These are beautiful towels and very soft but they just don't absorb moisture after a shower. I've laundered them several times (no fabric softener) hoping that it will change but so far, not so much."
1,",, Terrrrrible Quality,,,","I bought 4 pcs and and I am so disappointed in these white towels. They are so flawed. There are pulled threads in all of the towels. Anyway, this is the only purchase at Amazon that I m disappointed so far."
1,Where is the speech?????,"This home made DVD has everything except what it's suppose to have...The actual ""I have a dream speech""!! It goes right up to the moment MLK is introduced to the podium and then dissolves to him leaving!!! Don't buy unlees you want B-fotage of the event!!"
5,The California Dream - Newport,"This is an awesome documentary from beginning to end. I grew up in Newport, spend most of my free time at the beach and have heard many stories about the surf scene. The film clarifies a lot with funny stories and fascinating facts. (ex: you used to have to have a license on your board to surf!) Check it out, it's worth it."
3,"Before you buy it, define what you're looking for!!!!","Yes, as the title says, you have to define what you're looking for... The autor's review doesn't cheat, you will learn how to do amazing movements usig kamas, however, if you're looking about the real use of these beautiful weapons, you are losing your time & money, at least in my case, I didn't learn real selfdefense applications with kamas, however, I learned all plastic & estetic movements that maybe could impressed the judge during a championsip, no matter, many (or perhaps ALL)recomendations in this DVD don't kill a fly using kamas(ja!) but you have a lot of chances to get a good place in a championship. You decide..."
1,Difficult to imagine why this is included in the karate section!,"This program is as relevant to karate and kobudo as melon seed spitting and greasy pig catching. It's nothing more that a dance routine using karate weapons as a gimic. If you used them like this in earnest you would either injure yourself, or lose them to your opponent who would be happy to use them on you. If you live in the real world, give it a miss!"
3,"Nice Show, Poor Disc",The Content of the DVD is good. There is no doubt that Michele Krasnoo is a champion competitor. This DVD will show you some basics and teach you how to put it together into a form.The problem is the unbelievably poor qualinty of the disc itself. This DVD does not even have a chapter selection to it. That's bad news when you want to go to a certian part in the form. I don't think that masterline is that great of a martial arts video company.
5,Excellent!,"Item was well priced, packed well and received on time! You can't ask forbetter service! Shopping simply does not get any better than this!"
2,No driver for windows vista,"The GPS is helpful, but at this point is the only way I can use the product. The company has not made a driver for windows vista and when I was forced to buy a new computer when my computer crashed I got a windows vista computer. I spent alot of money on textbooks for work to download on the ppc and I can no longer use them because of the incompatibility with my computer. I tried to contact the company regarding this problem, but they don't seem to care."
4,P550 Review,"I did some research on this product before hand and I've been using it for a couple of months now. This product does exactly as it says it will do. The wireless works great. My kid likes to play the games on it. The gps works well, the unit starts up and loads quickly. ok to the cons..The gps sometimes takes 5 mins to find the gps which is kinda long when your waiting on it. But once locked it rarily lost signal, and if it did it would only be for a second. It says it has 11 million POIs. I found it didnt see streets or businesses that were built in the last couple years and I didnt see any way to update them. If I could go back, I would of still bought it. I am very happy with it. I put it in my cupholder, and slide it under the seat when not using."
2,Little to No Support.,"I purchased this from a local store because I figured it was a good buy for all the features. When I got it home I found out that it was very slow to boot up and the battery life was horrible. I tried to find tech support on it to see if it was a common problem and it took me a couple of hours before I found something. The problem was that it was on the European site and not the US site. So I downloaded this update to make my Mio have better battery but I found out that that update was only for the European versions after I downloaded it. When installed it screws up the PDA and it has to be shipped in for repair. I got the local store to take it back and bought the HP rx5915.My suggestion, don't buy this, it will leave you disappointed in the long run. If you are looking for a good one, look toward the rx5915"
5,Wonderfully Different!,"I really enjoyed the book. Just having the plans for the week as well as the shopping list was great. And the food was different. Some of it wasn't to my tastes, but it got me to try new and different things. I especially liked the Butternut Ravioli Stew. My husband liked it too, although I didn't put enough ravioli in it. (Forgot to buy extra!) Granted, some of the recipes weren't for my 3 1/2 year olds palate, but on the whole, it has gotten us to eat much healthier. Would recommend it for anyone looking for something quick and healthy for dinner, as well as us Flyladies who are learning to fly!!! Great work Leanne!"
2,My kids won't eat this stuff...,"This might work for families with older teenagers, but my kids (10 and 13) just won't eat things like baked fish or squash or eggplant. They're not picky kids; we travel extensively and they'll eat all kids of food, but I'd say four out of five of the recipes in this book were failures at my dinner table. It's a good place to start if you have no idea how to cook for a family, but I've had much more success with Cooking Light."
2,No pictures,Ok I realized I only like cookbooks with pictures of the food. I thought this book would be great but realized it was not. I need to see the food I am going to make. Also was disorganized and nothing I would really eat.
3,What do you people want?,"Why so ugly??? This woman is going above and beyond the call of duty to make life easier for the masses. If you are a gourmet cook or inspired by the same, this is not for you. However, there are many who are merely looking to make dinner a more enjoyable FAMILY affair and this book supports that effort. If, in your self-righteousness, you feel you can do better, by all means, I will support your effort and buy your book. Leanne: keep doing God's work and ignore those who hold themselves to the standards of the secular world!"
2,disappointed,I was disappointed with this book. A lot of the menus seem very gourmet. It's not typical stuff my family would eat. I felt like this was a waste of money. It was a typical recipe book.
5,Finally! A return to the family dinner table.,It's so refreshing to see a book that is putting emphasis back on the family dinner. My fondest memories as a child were eating dinner together every night at the dining room table. Life was a bit simpler back then. This is a great book for the modern family -- and tells how to have the family dinner while balancing life's activities. I hope a lot of families try to migrate back to the dinner table for quality time and to create lasting memories.
4,Saving dinner really does,"Well, this was delicious and VERY helpful. It's so wonderful to have my shopping done for me. Be sure you read the intro as it tells you to add salt/pepper etc to taste. But it is just yummy and has saved me money and time"
5,Saving dinner from boredom and the same-old-same-olds,"I am a fan of Leanne's from FlyLady, from her own menu mailer, and have been trying out her recipes published on-line including the new Atkins diet-friendly ones. Hooray for someone who is not just pushing meat and potatoes, but is trying to save us all from a rut (and from our unhealthy eating habits). I have a 13 year old son who is not a picky eater, and it is thanks in part to Leanne's approach: why not try something different before turning your nose up at something. My son BEGS me to make soup with Leanne's recipes (because it is so good -- and, better for Mom, so easy). Moreover (as long as it is accompanied by bread and salad and a nice dessert) soup IS a sufficient dinner. If someone says it is not, without even trying the soup, how can their opinion be taken seriously?Buy this book, you won't regret it (even if you have kids and a husband who turn up their noses at things)."
5,"best cookbook ever, found at the library","I found this at the library and had to just buy it. It had so many recipes I enjoyed in it. I did not follow the list of recipes with the shopping lists given, but I did enjoy a ton of recipe options."
3,"If you liked this book, I'd recommend","this book was recommended to me by a friend. My family isn't so crazy about beans so there was a number of recipes we couldn't try because of the beans, but the ones we've tried so far was okay. If you like this book, I'd recommend THE FRANTIC WOMAN'S GUIDE TO FEEDING FAMILY AND FRIENDS."
5,"six, seven, eight stars at least!","Ms Ely has brought more peace into my hectic life than any book I've ever read -bar none.This is an lovely book for new brides and new mothers, because it completely takes performance anxiety out of the kitchen. I'm so proud to serve a hot meal to my children and husband each night. They have liked Everything from the cookbook, even things I thought would make them turn up their noses (chicken with apples). Vegetables that I have never prepared (butternut squash) are met with curiosity rather than open comtempt...now that's progress."
1,Not a good cook book ! Save your money!,"I bought this cookbook and was very excited about it, as I am a flybaby. I used it the first week and the meals seemed pretty good. But as the 2nd week and the 3rd week past, the meals seemed very bland and very repetitive. My husband said my cooking without the book is much better! I don't normally use recipes, but I thought this would be a good way to help organize meals. It unfortunalty was not. You are better off using a free meal based w/ grocery list web site than spending your money on this or check it out from the library and see for yourself."
4,Saving Dinner,This book has some interesting recipes in it. My family has enjoyed 3 out of every 5 recipes I make from this book. It is a great book to have in my collection.
2,Didn't like the things I tried,"I made 2 dishes from this book, followed recipes to the letter, and both came out poorly.The Orange Chicken was so bad that we ended up tossing 4 chicken breasts, 4 cups of rice and a lot of fresh broccoli. The book seemed to cost me more than saved me time.I am moving on to a few other books and giving this to someone who might want to take more chances than I."
2,"Mediocre Recipes, good planning tips","I got this book hoping for some great recipes and help with planning. The planning aspect of this book is pretty good, but the recipes are pretty bland. I have made 6 recipes so far, and all of them seem to be missing something. I can play with them and tweek them, but I am not very happy about a recipe book that every recipe needs working on. If you like full flavor foods and simple food with gormet leanings, I would recommend a Rachel Ray book instead. She gives lots of menu planning/grocery shopping help as well and her recipes are always fabulous."
5,Changed my life,"This book is such a lifesaver. I use it every week to plan our meals, shop and cook each night. The recipes have been for the most part very good, and easy to make. The variety is wonderful. The best part is having something delicious to reheat the next day for lunch. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
4,loving to cook,I read about this book on flylady.com and with her recommendations I ventured out to try this book. Scanning it I found that it was not fancy gourmet (would never do type recipes) but tasty food we would really eat with health vegetables. I started using the book (and the print out shopping lists - GREAT)with in one week I was sold! Called my daughter and told her about it and now she is using the book too. Leanne Thank you!Kathy
5,Thank You!!!!!,"Though I don't use the menus every night (we do like to eat out), this book has been a godsend for me and my family!!! I make sure I have the ingredients for three of the meals in my house each week so I can whip up dinner tonight or the next night without the old panic over what to serve. Real, hot, healthy food for my family....thank you!!! Jill"
4,A well written book,"I really liked this book. It has a bunch of easy to follow, and easy to make, recipes that serve 6, which is good for my large family. I recommend it to anyone who has a busy life and a family to take care of."
4,great ideas!,"I enjoy Leanne's style, and have enjoyed a few of her recipes as well! My kids are enjoying the Themed dinner schedule, and I am still trying to get into the rythym of the system but I know it will be great when I do!"
2,Not my favorite,"Well...I was very excited to get this book for Christmas, but I have to say the recipes are not my favorite. Some seem a bit too strange to me, like sweet bean burritos (using sweet potatoes and black beans). Most recipes have lots of onion as well, so you have to chop onion every night. Not fun for me. I agree that they seem a bit bland. It's fun to see new ideas, but when the ingredients are some that I have never even heard of...I was just a little disappointed. It's a good thought!"
2,"My family is picky, so they don't like it. . .","I got this book, and I was so excited by the idea of a weekly plan and shopping list, but I guess my family is too picky. I made an entire week right out of the book and my family did not like a single recipe.The concept is fantastic, so I think I will pick my own set of recipes and then construct my own shopping list and go from there."
5,Saving Dinner--What a Blessing!,"Thank you, Leanne, for helping me feed my family better! No, not everyone likes all of the dinners but I have them marked as to which ones the family likes, which ones the kids like and which ones my husband likes. I make the ones the kids like when my husband works late and sometimes I'll make the kids something quick and easy and make something nice just for him and me. Also, my kids have tried new things and discovered that they actually like many of them! No, they still won't eat zucchini but they do like fresh spinach and other things, much to their surprise! And, with the shopping list built right in it takes out so much of the stress of buying groceries with toddlers in tow! Thanks again for all of your hard work and for all you've done for my family! :)"
5,Awesome book. Has made a real difference for us,"This book has brought variety and nutrition back into our dinners. To date there has not been a single dinner we altogether hated. Some we preferred over others, but that's life. They were all straight forward to prepare and chuck full of veggies and other healthy items.We have been using it over 2 months, every week. Very happy with it."
2,"Mistakes, omissions.","I love the concept, the recipes are generally good, but I wish someone had proofed the lists and recipes better. There are ingredients missing from the shopping lists that you later need for the recipe and quantities are misprinted. The website has a link to go and check all the updated corrections but I thought the point of this was to save time. I think someone will come along with a better version soon. It needs to be at least thorougly proofed before publishing again."
2,I already have a cookbook,"I really bought this book because I have two small girls and I wanted my family to be the family who cooks dinner every night and eats at the dinner table instead of feeding the babies and us eating later. So I thought this would be more of a workbook or something to help me accomplish this. Okay, so I already have cookbooks and I can honestly say I can write and use a grocery list. So this seems to be all this book is. A cookbook with a grocery list. If cookbooks and grocery lists did it for me, I would already be cooking dinner for the family every night."
3,it's a place to start,"I like what Leanne is trying to, and judging by the reviews she has helped many people. But, this book is really suited only for people who just don't know how to cook or who are incredibly time limited. I really haven't liked any of her recipes, although I want to. They simply aren't all that interesting. I find that it doesn't take me that long to sit down with a couple of cookbooks and think out a weekly menu plan and shopping list. I copy these to notecards, so I have the best/easiest recipes close at hand for future menu planning."
5,She saved my Dinner,"I started by using Leanne's recipes off of FlyLady but found I wanted more!! I waited with baited breath for her book to come out and even went hunting for it on my Holidays. Everyone was out of it right away so I ordered it online and it was delivered to me within 4 days. WOW! I have not been dissapointed. I am one of the world's worst cooks and with this book I can actually feed my diabetic husband, myself, a very busy 15 yo and a vegetarian who eats at wierd hours with the same meal plan and shopping list. And they all love what I cook. We are actually spending less on eating out and we are all eating (mostly) at the same time. Leanne makes cooking fun again."
5,Superb meals.,"This book provides a years worth of meals and shopping lists. It is divided into weeks and each week you get five main course dishes and a shopping list. There are also various hints and tips included.Although I can cook, plan meals, develop a shopping list I bought this book. It is full of great recipes. Each one I have tried comes out great. Most of the recipes are easy and require normal easy to find ingredients. There are a wide variety of meals from chinese to crock pot to fish to mexican. If all you used was this cook book to fix dinner for a year, you would not be bored.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
5,thanks for all of your help!!,"after making beautiful meals and blowing my food budget week after week i decided to use this book after reading about it at flylady.net....i am a great cook and end up going to the grocery store way more than i should because i only plan ""special"" meals....my DS's would be climbing the walls waiting for dinner or going crazy as we stop at the store to ""get a few things"". you have brought organization to my meals...sure we don't LOVE all the meals but we have moved them around and very simply made it work for US...thanks for showing me how to make my lists work and save me money, time and sanity in the process....love the frugal menu planner and low-carb from your site as well...you and flylady have allowed me to enjoy my DS's and our time together more than you will ever know...peace and blessings...finally flying in baltimore, md"
1,Not that great,"I purchased this cookbook because I am a fan of Fly Lady.I didn't like the recipes.I like to decide the menu we will be having.A great cookbook I really like is Desperation Dinners.This was suggested by a friend w/ 5 kids.I find the recipes quick,healthy,and very kid friendly.My 11 yo daughter is a very picky eater yet she eats almost everything I make from there!!!Now that's a 5 star easy time saving cookbook!!!!"
2,Borrow it from the library,"Like many of the other reviewers, I had seen the hype for this book on the Flylady site.There are some good recipes in the book, and the concept of the book is great (weekly menu/shopping list). However, after putting it into practice, I was not impressed. I didn't care for many of the recipes, and had to alter the shopping list as there are only three in my family. In the end I gave up and made my own menus (which I've been doing for quite a while) and my own shopping lists. I will use a recipe from the book, but will no longer use the menu plan & shopping lists. Looking back, I wish I would have borrowed the book from the libary and copied down the recipes I thought I would like and incorporated them into my own menu plans.Just my two cents..."
5,Great resource for busy families!,"This cookbook is a big help for anyone wanting to eat healthier and save money. The weekly menu's and shopping lists make it easy to have fast, delicious meals at home. I really like how the ingredients are all easy to find at my local grocery store and aren't out of my budget. The meals I've cooked from Saving Dinner have been a hit with my husband and my son.It's also helpful for anyone counting calories, because the nutritional content for each meal is printed at the end of each recipe.I would recommend Saving Dinner to my friends and family."
4,Easy to use.,"This cook book is easy to use, and requires little to no research on your next meal. It even has the grocery list made up for you so you don't have to do it. It has easy to make and healthy meals, that is nice for the whole family. If you're reading this, you have to try it, it is awesome."
3,a good idea,"I liked this book very much. To say it is a cookbook, is a mistake. It is more than a cookbook. I also have the low carb cookbook, & I have to admit I like it better. This one's receipes can be modified as well as the side dishes to make it more carb friendly. I cannot beleive some of the reviews I've read. Do people not look thru books before buying them??? Do you have to like every receipe in a book??? Chicken is one of the most low carb protein sources and one of the main ingredients on many diets therefore one would expect to see a lot of receipes with that ingredient. I do know how to cook, but sometimes it is nice to not have to think about it. That is where this book comes in. If you are not as organized as some people, or if you are tired of the same old meals you have been dishing out, then there are some really good & tasty ideas. This book is not for everyone, but then everyone does not need this book. Thank you, Leanne for both books."
3,Meg's review,"I dearly love this book. It is such a good idea and well worth its price. Some of the recipes are too spicy for my taste and might not rate well with children but the whole concept of getting the family back to the table is all important. Of the recipes that I have tried, the delicious ones far outweigh the bad ones. The meals are so nutritious and I already feel better. This makes it a money saver in that thre are less doctor bills. I plan on buying this for all my friends for Christmas."
1,mis labeled,when i purchased this the product description said it was an access roll up tonneau cover. i ordered it and i got a bag of brackets and the bag was ripped open. i called amazon and they assured me that this was a mistake and they would make sure i got a tonneau cover and not brackets. well the second order came and guess what more brackets!
4,Good Gospel Story,Good animated Christian history narrative teaching appropriate behaviors and values for Christian believers. The series tells the story of a Christian family in ancient Rome.
2,Cheap glass,Other than the fact that my order didn't arrive when it was suppose to the quality of the bottles are 3rd rate thin cheap glass.
2,Loo-kee sort of interesting,She-ra was good in the beginning. When Loo-kee helps out he misses the Horde trooper in the tree. In the they find out where the prisoner is.
5,Awesome,This book is an absolute must for anyone wishing to breed boas and pythons. Information is broken down by species and local making reference a snap. No matter your experience level this book covers it all.
1,Aurora shredders = Disposable.,"As you'll see by clicking on most Aurora shredders and reading the reviews, they use cheap plastic gears to run the blades, and they invariably strip (even if you follow the instructions - I never came close to running more than 5 sheets at once, much less 7), rendering the machine equal to a wastebasket with a very heavy lid.I hate junking something that looks so new. I'll never again buy a shredder from these people. If you do, I hope you know how to fabricate your own gears...because you definitely can't get new ones from the company. Even if you are able to track down a Customer Service number (hope you read the Da Vinci Code, that will be good practice), they don't answer their phones. High class operation all around."
2,Completely awful,"""Till Eulenspiegel"" consists of a series of vignettes about a young man who roams through Germany and other countries having adventures, playing tricks on people and goofing off. It seems like the punchline of every single story has to do with Euelenspiegel defecating on or in something or someone. That's it. That's the book's running joke. I suppose if you were an illiterate German peasant sitting around a hearth fire in the 1500s, you'd find these tales of feces and bad puns hilarious, but I didn't. Dumb humor doesn't become entertaining just because it's old. Of course, since a good majority of modern Americans are probably less sophisticated than an illiterate German peasant from 400 years ago, perhaps Till Eulenspiegel is due for a comeback. Hollywood could cast Johnny Knoxville as this retarded crapped crusader, and he could crap all over American audiences, who will double over with laughter at every fart noise."
2,FYI on Size,"25.4mm (1-inch) is the quill size (insertion part of the stem) for a fork that has an outer diameter of 1+1/8 inch. Yes it's hard to decipher, but people who actually KNOW this stuff are still buying the wrong part because you need a 1-inch quill for a 1+1/8-inch fork."
1,How about an accurate description?,"Trying to decipher dimensions on bicycle parts can be vexing.Right next to the dimension: 1-1/8"" is 25.4 in parentheses.25.4 (millimeters, I assume) is equivalent to ""one inch"", not ""one and one eighth inch"".So which number is the right one? This may be obvious to some bike experts, but the rest of us dummys would like to know whether this thing will fit a one inch diameter handlebar and a one inch quill diameter. I see that they haven't sold any of these yet. Maybe this would change if people knew that what they were buying would fit their bike."
3,Roadmarks,"Combine the walking through shadows of the Amber series with the history of the world stretching into infinity like Farmer's River World series and through in some dragons (just 'cause) and you get Roadmarks.There are parallel stories each playing out one chapter at a time. They are labeled: Two and One. Chapters Two follow Red and Chapters One follow Randy and how these two stories relate to each other is the main crux of the book.The book is only 187 pages, so a quick read, though one might need time to mull the chapters early on. I have to admit that I cheated and read all the Chapters Two first and then went back and read all of the Chapters One. I'm finding that I don't always like reading a book linearly and that it's not always important to read from page one all the way through to the end. Sometimes it works to skip around."
5,Another Classic from Zelazny,"A beautifully wrought tale of a mans spiritual journey to the realization of self.I think sometimes people do not catch Zelazny's work because they do not see the undercurrents at work in his writing. In most of his best work there are two levels to read upon.I hope, most fervently, that I can achieve that kind of greatness in mine someday."
5,I love this book,"This book is probably the best thing I've read in years! And I read a lot!So interesting and wonderfully written. I couldn't put it down! Really, really good read.I've been looking around for more of Eric Healy's work. Keep writing Eric!"
5,absorbing,"This is one of the more compelling espionage thrillers I've read - found myself sneaking chapters in the middle of work, staying up late - well-developed, deeply sympathetic, but flawed lead characters - both protagonist and bad guy; support characters were intriguing enough I want to follow their stories; nice insider-info feel; and plot and writing style move you steadily along with very few missteps or bog-downs. My only quibble was the two obnoxious bureaucratic officials were too one-dimensional. This book was a delight. Hartov just made my must-read author list."
1,The heat of ramadan made me cold with boredom!,"First of all, I couldn't tell you how it ended, cause I never got that far. Except for the execution in the beginning of the book, and the ensuing chase, this book had litterally nothing to keep the reader interested enough to bother with finishing the story.The author spent way to much time dealing with the main, and secondary character's background lives to the point where it become down right boring!I read it to the halfway point, where I could no longer stand it, tore it up, and threw it in the trash can, like I do with all the books that thoroughly disgust, or bore me!Note: there was a movie based on this book, with Christopher Lambert playing the lead role. Suggestion: see the movie, like Bond, it was far better than the book."
4,LOVE MURRAY,MY SON LOVES THE WIGGLES! MURRAY IS HIS FAVORITE! HE TAKES THIS DOLL WITH US EVERYWHERE WE GO. THE ONLY THING IS THE ENTIRE SONG NEEDS TO PLAY INSTEAD OF JUST A SMALL CLIP.
3,More Fun in the Box,Our son was really thrilled with Murray until he was removed from the box--Ever since then Murray has been placed in a variety of boxes in an attempt to restore the excitement . . . It's nice that Murray plays three different tunes (as opposed to Henry who plays only one) but perhaps he is a bit too much for a two-year-old.
5,Some of the best Remix work ever.,"The problem with this disk is that it is too short! Teasing us with only 2 songs! If you are familiar with either seminal techno-industrial artist, get this 'single.' This is truly one of the best collaborative/remix projects ever."
3,Add to your collection if you're a die hard TKK/KMFDM fan,"Both tracks are a bit on the dancy side for my tastes, the first more so, the second track is more of a keeper. Pass & pick up a CD with more tracks if you're new to both KMFDM & TKK."
2,Ground pronging,"Very neat idea, I bought several of both models 12PS1 and 12PS2. The #12PS1 is perfect. The #12PS2 is a little less useful. They missed the bullseye mark here slightly by having the cord come off the plug at 90 degrees, but opposite the ground prong side of the plug. This means that if you plug into a wall outlet the cord will have to fold back on itself under it's own weight and may block the other outlet. Also on power strips with two rows of outlets, the ground prong usually faces away from the center of the strip. This means the 12PS2 cord blocks the other row of outlets, defeating the intended use of giving you an extra outlet."
1,Skip It,"I really enjoyed No Exit and the recent live album, so was looking forward to another new Blondie album. They really changed direction here and I'm sad to say this is an awful album. I've been unable to listen to it all the way through; I just find it to be annoying. Whereas No Exit had a variety of styles, this one seems to be more of a disco album. I was never a big disco fan, but I felt that Blondie was able to pull it off successfully in the past. They were a tight and talented bad. I hope they continue to record, but more away from this style of music. Unless you are a big disco fan, I recommend you stay away from the Curse of Blondie."
2,All good things eventually get stale!,"This is another poor effort from Blondie. As with their last album ""No Exit"" there is only one good song on the cd. This one's ""Maria"" is ""Good Boys."" Once you hear that song the rest of the album sounds boring and lacks hooks. If only Blondie could make an album with 10 songs like ""Good Boys"" they could make a big comeback!I can only look back and remember their glory days of ""Parallel Lines"" and ""Eat to the Beat."" If you don't have those two albums, go get them now...Even ""AutoAmerican"" would be a better purchase."
4,The Curse of Blondie Works Like A Charm,"Blondie sounds strong and vital on their latest release, incorporating a myriad of styles as always, showing versatility and creating a pleasurable listening experience. As a rock fan first and foremost, I absolutely love the song ""Golden Rod"". Deborah Harry's vocal is superb on this driving rock song that never lets up from start to finish. Even as the song fades, Debbie's vocal is still going strong. ""Last One in the World"" is classic Blondie and could have been on Parallel Lines. ""Good Boys"" is right in the groove and is the obvious choice for a single, it should be all over the radio. Other excellent tracks include ""Undone"", ""End to End"" ""Magic"" and ""The Tingler"". I thoroughly enjoy listening to this disc."
4,BLONDIE FOREVER!!!!,"Perhaps the only female rocker to age gracefully, Deborah Harry needs no introduction.And on this release she and her boys confirm Blondie's status, as one of rock's most influential acts.Every track on this cd is a killer.Stylewise there's '80s electropop(Good Boys,Undone),rap(Shakedown),pure rock'n'roll(Goldenrod,Hey Joe) and even a tradional Japanese folk song(Magic)..A handful of singles can easily be picked here but we'll leave that to the band to decide.I just hope that the US release will have bonus cuts as well."
3,its good,"I've been a fan of Blondie since the seventies. This is better than the last one, though the DVD of Blondie live is still my favorite from their ""comeback"" period. This new CD has some really great tracks, some tracks that don't quite work (Hey Joe), and a few at the end that are simply strange. All in all, it won't win over any new converts and there aren't any ""hits"" that USA teenagers will want to hear. But the band doesn't have to prove anything at this point -- they made several great albums in their heyday. My only real complaint is the Debbie Harry's voice is processed with studio effects in a few songs. Her voice doesn't need fixing."
5,Blondie cooking up a new curse of music,"The Curse of Blondie isn't anything like any previous Blondie albums. It's as experimental as AutoAmerican and The Hunter albums, but in a much different way. The Curse of Blondie is geared towards guitars and odd background musical arrangements. The standout tracks are ""Magic and Good Boys"". Good Boys is absolutely the best DANCE-ROCK song of 2003, hands down. There is not a song out this year as catchy and creative as ""Good Boys"". Classic Blondie, it's as if Blondie took their #1 Hits 'Heart of Glass and Rapture"" put them in a blender and hit mix. Truly a brilliant song. The other standout is ""Magic"", which is really beautiful. The song ""Shakedown"" is a bit raunchy, sort of a Modern day ""One way or Another"" meets Madonna's ""EROTICA"".The Curse of Blondie is a job well done, but it's not a ""Parallel Lines or Eat to the Beat"", none the less it's a very solid album, and musically up to date."
4,better than 'last exit' but ultimately flawed,"The CD starts out with an excrutiatingly awful ""Shakedown""--equally as bad as Debbie's rap w/ the no-talent/has been Coolio. ""Good Boys"" however, is such a cool, slick Vice City-sounding dance track---the video's cool too. I wish there was more of that new-wavey, early 80's sound, that Garbage had perfected in the 90's, that was evident in ""Undone"". ""Golden Rod"" rocks!!! ""Background Melody"" shows a maturity in lyrics, and in Debbie's vocal range. Lastly, I agree with one of the earlier postings about ""Last One In the World"". The first time I heard it, I winced in embarrassment for Debbie. An awful, awful song. Verdict? A mixed bag of well-crafted songs that highlights the dreck of a few truly bad songs.P.S. Debbie, you look fantastic, but how about hiring a new stylist and ditching the headband & micro-mini's?"
4,Give it a chance.,"Okay, I'll admit it. The first time through this CD was disappointing to say the least. This is partly because I keep expecting them to return to their 1970's style and I thought ""It's not here, dammit!"" What's strange is that with repeated listenings it becomes very clear that their roots are indeed present here, along with a pleasant evolution of the band. You get the best of both worlds here. So if you listened to it once and are prepared to immediately shelve it after that initial listen, all I can say is be patient. Wait a couple of days and play it again. It only took me twice to appreciate this. Your mileage may vary. It's still not my favorite Blondie album, but my opinion of it has completely turned around since my first listen."
4,The Curse of Blondie Works Like A Charm,"Blondie sounds strong and vital on their latest release, incorporating a myriad of styles as always, showing versatility and creating a pleasurable listening experience.

I thoroughly enjoy listening to this disc."
3,Undone.,"This is a tough one to grade. I like Blondie, and the music is executed well. There is a wide range of sounds on this cd, but I could not help but feel this was a tired effort. Even with long time keyboardist Jimmy Destri back on board I was expecting more. Looking over the cd packaging it seems evident that the band is trying to recapture their late 70's glory, but the music on ""Curse"" doesn't add up. They even pulled old 70's and 80's hitmaking producer Giorgio Moroder in for a bonus mix of ""Good Boys"". There are some tracks that stand out, but there does not appear to be any hit single that stands out. The energy that once infused classic tracks like ""Heart Of Glass"" and ""Call Me"" is glaringly absent here. While the musicianship is solid and Deborah Harry's vocals sound better than ever, the music felt unoriginal and unmemorable. I'm surprised that so many reviewers have given this disc such high marks. This is for Blondie fans only, and even then, they might be disappointed."
4,Shed the curse?,"The No Exit album sealed Blondies 'comeback' succesfully, and there is no doubt that the band will continue to be relevant if they continue recording material of this calibre.There are MANY great trax on the cd, the majority of which are typical Blondie (although eclectic - they still have their signature 'sound'). My personal favourites are: Goodboys, Undone, Diamond Bridge, Golden Rod, Rules for Living, and End to End.So why a 4 star rating?For tme, there are 4 really weak trax, that literaly go know-where, and dont seem to have any purpose other than to fill the album out.Background melody - trying to recapture Tide is High? - badly.Magic - Trying to recapture Debbis 'calamarie' - badly.Hello Joe - simply - nothing, the song doesnt develop into anything.The Tingler - Another nothing song, lyrically thinks its more clever than it is.Overal, an excellent album, and a truly welcome return. Shame aboout those 4 trax..."
2,CD Length Is The Curse,"Cut the ""experimental"" filler, and this would be a great pop album. Program these tracks: 2, 3, 4, and 10-14 (with 9 being optional), and you've got a good, strong record in classic Blondie vein. Being a Blondie fan, I paid big bucks for the Australian import when this came out there first last year; needless to say, I should have waited for a domestic release."
2,curses,"i was hoping this once-amazing band would redeem themselves and break back into the mainstream, and possibly chart a song.this album is not very good. half of it is unlistenable, monotonous jazz/rock. i wouldnt know what else to call it.the music doenst grab you with a sense of excitement, anticipation, or unease, as blondie had done in past work.i think this is an improvement from ""no exit"", but not by much. id say for curious fans of rock/punk, go with the compilations, then if you must, the big 3: ""plastic letters"", ""parallel lines"", and ""eat to the beat""."
4,Worth it for Eric Roberts' performance,"Well I knew that an adaptation of a Willa Cather story would be grim. Notice: don't watch this when you're depressed. The story is relatively simple--a young, sensitive boy with taste for the ""better things in life"" seizes a chance to escape from his dreary existence and go on to the Waldorf Hotel in New York...his idea of Paradise.Again, since this is a Cather story you know it will have a horrible end but it is worth hanging in there just watch the remarkable Eric Roberts. He is exquisite looking, has a voice like deep honey and gives a remarkable performance. Every thought of the young fellow as he makes his way at the Waldorf is perfectly registered through the actor's face.This isn't a feel good film and I don't recommend it for everyone. But, for what it attempts, it does a good job."
2,Ehhh...,"This video is alright. Eric Roberts is not very believable as a young school aged boy, and his physical acting during the painting and symphony scenes is distracting and overdone. The video has elements not included in the story, perhaps to make Paul seem a more humane character than the cold portyal in print. In the written story, he seems to simply shut out his father and look down on his peers with an aloof disdain. However, the movie shows a boy who tries to please his father; a boy treated cruelly by his classmates. Though nicely filmed and authentic in appearance, the film tries too hard to accomplish what the story did not."
3,Not my roots,"""Root Ecology"" is no. 168 in a the apparently rather extensive series of books called ""Ecological studies"". And yes, they all have attractive green covers.This book is extremely technical and dense, for advanced botanists only. Chapter headings include: ""Root competition: Towards a mechanistic understanding"", ""Interactions between oxygen-releasing roots and microbial processes in flooded soil sands sediments"" and ""Hydraulic properties of roots"".Well, if you want to get to the root of things, I suppose this is a good place to start, LOL."
2,disapointed,"I really Like Mr Liddy and was hoping that this book would give me more of the Liddy Style, but it was full of things that you could get over the internet. I wanted to see more things that one could do to protect ones self, as I thought Mr Liddy could share. The book has many good generic tips. I just wanted to read more things that Mr Liddy and his son could tell us that could be found no where else. I felt the book fell a bit short."
3,Fight Back: tacklig terrorism,I found it geared more toward CEO's of large corporations that need protection rather that the common individual.
5,excellent!,"Lemony snicket is an amazing author..all of his books were amazing and quite funny...the funniest was the 3rd with aunt josephine and her being afraid of almost everything!..however of all the books i've read..the slippery slope is no doubt my favourite...beggining , middle, and the end were so full of suspense and so action packed i could'nt drop the book..for anyone who hasn't read this book..i suggest u buy it and READ IT...its great for actualy any age and i hope there are more of these books to come...hopefully the books will get longer so that i don't finish them in a few days like the rest..books that are this great should be at least 500 pages so we can enjoy them longer."
3,Rescuing Sunny,"I do recomend this book because it is an adventure waiting for someone to read. This book is full with action and there is never a time when you don't want to know whats going to happen next. The plot wasn't very believable like in some parts it was far fetched. Like the orphans would get an idea in their mind and every time it came out how they wanted to it to. A person who would enjoy reading it is a person who like adventures because this book has an adventure on every page. I would read another book by this author, because I read the whole series so far and I'm on book 10, and I am not going to just stop reading the series when there is only 13 books to read."
5,I'm impressed,Best of the series so far. Alternating the action between the two older siblings in one chapter and Sunny in the next really worked for me.
1,Terrible stories...try Harry Potter instead,I read the first one of these books and was horrified at the things that happened to these children from which no adult was able to protect them. I sometimes wonder why we jump on the bandwagon of anything that comes into print. At least in the Harry Potter series there are some genuinely good and effective adults as well as a young man who manages to outsmart the bad guys (most of the time).
5,"10th is best, so far......","The tenth installment of the ""series of unfortunate events"" is a comepletely new and awesome adventure. There are so many twists and turns, it is almost unreal, with a shocking, almost u-turn twist in the middle. Once again, you get more light shed on the true meaning of VFD, but somehow, the organization is as mysterious as ever......At the end, you want Snicket to release the next book more than ever. Not only does it leave you hanging on the edge, but it cuts off suddenly, as usual, right in the middle of another twisting climax."
5,Fantastic even Unfortunate,"If you like happy, happy, happy stories, you shouldn't read it. This book is the best Unfortunate story I read so far. It is full of adventure of Baudelairs. I think that Sunny did a lot in this book after getting captured by Count Olaf. She is ordered to make foods which is mentioned good, clean up the car and lots more. In the middle of the story, old character (whom they didn't want to see her again) comes back and the Baudelairs meets the last Quagmire triplets. Snow gnats, new villans, Snow Scouts, many V.F.Ds, the last safest place, and more. It's a book you never want to miss reading it."
4,Unfortunate Event for unfortunate people,"The SERIES OF UFORTUNATE EVENTS THE SLIPPERY SLOPE is a tale about Violent, Klaus, and Sunny trying to escape Count Olaf. However, Count Olaf developed another evil plan and captures Sunny. He has killed many people, buried many places and ruined many people's lives. I give this book four stars because the children are faced with more problems and worries about the secrets of VFD. Also they meet someone who was supposed to be dead. With the help of this person they figure out some of their questions about VFD. But, will it be enough to rescue Sunny and stop Count Olaf. Is there any hope the children? Will the ever feel safe and be out of the clutches of Count Olaf?The one thing I don't like about these books is that they all end the same and it gets boring. Is there even going to be an end?"
3,Not up to par with other recent books in the series.,"Lemony Snicket, The Slippery Slope (Scholastic, 2003)As we approach the end of the Series of Unfortunate Events, I don't want to say that the quality of the books is slipping. After all, books eight and nine showed Lemony Snicket going in a new, and very interesting, direction. Unfortunately, The Slippery Slope does nothing more than coast on the coattails of the smash hit series.It's not that The Slippery Slope is a bad book, it's just a predictable book. The sense of delight and wonder that has been a hallmark since the series' beginning seems to have lost a deal of its lustre, and while it's just as readable as the other books in the series, this is the first time one of them has really left me wondering if the series is going downhill since The Wide Window. Well, it picked up after that; I have guarded hope that The Grim Grotto will see the Baudelaire children back to being, well, the Baudelaire children. ***"
4,The Slippery Slope,The slippery slope is a book that will keep you on your toes the whole way throgh.Lemony Snicket wrote this book wonderfully.
5,Great!,"This is a great book! If you like this book then you should read the whole series 1-11. I REALLY recomend this book and the whole series! Lemony Snicket is planning 13 books, a very unfortunate number!"
3,Finally! Some answers.,"Sunny comes into her own as ""a young girl"" and no longer a baby. She also develops an interest in cooking. Oh, and the Beaudelaires escape from Count Olaf again.Many more answers to series-long mysteries in this one, so that's good."
4,Lemony Snickets,My grandaughter was hoping to get the rest of the books in the series she was reading and we were lucky to find the choices at Amazon. The stores throughout the US intrigued her and we could chose the prices that were viable per book vs getting the whole sets that were available as well. They came in great condition and she was delighted.
5,They keep getting better...,"Every time I start a new book in this series, I think I have a good idea of where it is going, but I always end up surprised. I love the way the books have evolved from the simple first few chapters to the intricit plot we're knee-deep in now."
5,My favorite book in the series!,"You should definately buy(or get from the library) this awesome book! Lemony Snicket has the suspense all in this 335 page book!!!!Mr. Snicket can do anything but this book is the best! Violet and Klaus Baudelaire are trying to save their sister, Sunny from the trecherous villan, Count Olf. If you have not read any of the other 9 books Mr. Snicket has written, you should read THE BAD BEGINNIG first."
4,AN AMAZING BOOK,"This book is soo awesome! It truley says Lemony Snicket. One of his best books! Read this book you will love it if you like Mystery, Drama,and a little bit of comedy mixed in one! The perfect blend of all of the listed above!"
5,Oh! My Goodness!,"My little brother likes these books, so one day I decided to pick one up. I immediately became hooked. But this one is just so weird! It's not at all like the other ones. but it is definitely the best. I felt The Carnivorous Carnival was something of a letdown. But this returns full swing to the classic Lemony Snicket goodness. But this one IS a little weird, don't you think? I mean, it's not as unfortunate, SO many secrets are revealed, they meet the fire survivor (I'm not sayin' who), and there are some hidden morals and meanings that some kids wouldn't pick up. It shown the determination that Klaus and Violet had when Sunny was kidnapped in the previous book. I love this one. It's the best one since Vile Village!"
3,"A Weakened Sweet Honey, with too much Gloss","As a big fan of Sweet Honey and owner of virtually all their CDs, I was disappointed with ""twenty-five."" While still delivering beautiful harmonies, Sweet Honey have written songs that are a bit more pop-ish than earlier works and the strongest songs seem to be the ones with more concentration on the solo singer rather than the innovation that comes with the group making melodies a cappella. If you're looking for a great Sweet Honey CD, go to some of their stronger works, such as: Selections 1976-1988, Sacred Ground, and In This Land."
1,Pompus,I did not like this book. It was bloated. The author thinks he's Bill Clinton. He's just some guy who made a little money. I mean little because in the world he so dearly loves he is nothing but a secretary. I would love to hear from Sherry Lansing or Harvey Weinstein but Mike Medavoy. A joker.
3,Nice Album,"This is worth 3.5 stars I think, and probably worth owning if you like jazz. The fourth track, ""Bag of Jewels"" doesn't rate much of a mention on the original sleave notes, but it is a totally cooking track. For me this one is the highlight of the album. Meanwhile the first three tracks seem pretty tame by comparison. The final track is rather interesting. The organ seems to steal the show on this whole album for me but maybe that is because there are so few examples of it around these days. Lou Donaldson's sax seems fairly constrained most of the way, but enjoyable to hear none the less. Overall this is an easy album to listen too, but it lacks a bit of spark and spontaneity on the first few tracks."
4,Great Soul Jazz Re-issue,"Probably the best of Lou Donaldson's backbeat-driven rock/funk recordings. With Melvin Sparks (guitar) and Idris Muhammad (drums). ""Dapper Dan"" is a King Curtis Tune."
3,Not a Book - an Intellectual Paper,"This booklet is a three paper compilation on the issues with modern education.I read this set as a book, and was disappointed; Mostly because no major issues are conquered or thesis's proven.Rather each section, opens the readers eyes to the problems in modern education. If you want to read a refreshing point of view, or if you know of someone who could use the mental shakeup, then this booklet will be worthwhile.Two of the selections in this set are abbreviated versions of much larger books (and hence are available elsewhere).I didn't gain much from this set, but I'd already read the much larger book by John Taylor Gatto, which made up section 2 in this booklet."
5,Siempre Salsa,"All eight tracks in this CD are winners. The lead off number, Cena Para Seis, has been in my mind ever since I first heard it. If you like Latin Jazz, you can't go wrong with this offering by Rick Davies."
4,Superkicker Bruce Leung Siu Lung takes on the role as the head of the Ten Tigers,"Not really much of a story here. Basically the Ten Tigers help the common people battle evil kung fu masters. Among the cast of the Ten Tigers are Bruce Leung Siu Lung, Jason Pai Paio, Lau Hok Nin, Han Kwok Choi, Larry Lee and Wong Yuen San. The villains include San Kuai, Charlie Chan and Kong Do. All of the fights are good, and the last 25 minutes is literally nonstop action. I am a big Bruce Leung fan and this is definitely one of his best movies.4/5Picture quality is decent and its partly widescreen."
2,ITS NOT ALL THAT!!!,I WASNT FEELING THIS DVD AT ALL. THE STORY WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE SEEMED LIKE AND IT JUST DIDNT HOLD MY ATTENTION. I DONT SUGGEST THIS TO OTHERS UNLESS YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR COLLECTION
4,"Great Case and Fit, But No Lock & Key Mechanism","This is a case if you want to take everything that you need for photography and then you can fit various other personal articles as well. The construction is top notch, but this case is advertised as having a locking mechanism. (I'm going to Honduras in October '04 and that was attractive). Also, since the large size of this case, you may want to purchase a smaller case for the lighter day trips."
1,It ain't no beach,"Alex Garland's first novel the Beach was fascinating, one of the best books I've ever opened. That was enough for me to give The Tesseract a try. While, I couldn't put The Beach down, The Tesseract was easy to forget. Until the hypercube finally unwinds, it is only a mass of boring characters writrten in the monotonous style of Genesis. My suggestion: read The Beach if you haven't and wait for Alex Garland's third novel."
4,Tightly written and riveting. The characters are real...,"This is a book for those who appreciate tightly written and character-rich writing. The Tesseract is a stunning change for Garland. Unlike in his previous novel, The Beach, he draws his scenes and characters with great sensitivity.For example, there are two brilliantly written funeral scenes. One of them, concerning the disfigurement of a child during a funeral, is particularly gripping. When Garland came to Seattle for a reading, I asked him where he got the idea for this scene. He then told a story of him attending a funeral in the Philipines during which the deceased's body was accidentally exposed and broken apart to the shock and horror of everyone there. All who see him on his book tour should ask him about it; it will rivet you."
3,Confusing.,"I read Garland's first novel, The Beach, and found a literary gem. However, his latest work simply baffles me. Unlike his debut which is fast-pacing and doesn't keep the reader waiting, The Tesseract is slow to the extent of almost being drab. His characters are probably his only redeeming quality in this book."
5,"If you grew up in the 80's, think you have no time to read.",Amazingly enough my generation is succeptable to information bits. We have short attention spans and even less time to read or so we think. Tesseract is a brilliant example of getting our attention quickly and making us want to turn the page. Alex Garland is truly a voice for this generation and his ablity to speak to us is not an easy task. The story was balanced and left me with many anxiously awaited page turns. I think even if you had never been in a foreign country let alone the Philippines he captures a very real perspective of the culture. READ IT!
1,Amateurish and strangely overrated,I read a few good reviews of this book before reading it and can't understand how it's managed to even get reviewed in major publications. The dialogue in this book is atrocious and the attempts to describe the underbelly of Manila come off as amateurish writing. I was very disappointed and definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I honestly gave the book a chance and finished it all but it just wasn't worth it.
1,Flat and insipid,"I was drawn to this book based on both the hype and the Graham Greene comparisons. Boy, does Garland have a PR firm or what? The dialogue in this book is silly. Read aloud, one can only cringe. As for the structure, it may be cool and of-the-moment and postmodern, but it isn't handled well enough to engage a serious reader or to even entertain a serious thought. The most sagacious, smartest moment of this book is the epigraph."
2,Maeve Binchy with guns,"After the beach, which I quite enjoyed, this book was disapointingly pedestrian and predictable. It was like a mills and boon set in the tropics - nearly 'her heaving bosom' sort of fiction. The title was mysterious enough to have me running to the dictionary during the book but, like the Beach it did'nt deliver. You feel the book was published on the strenght of the Beach's success as opposed to the literary merits of either book.I don't think I'll be reading any more Alex Garland."
1,"Without a doubt, the worst book I've read in years","Having read and enjoyed the Beach, I decided to try The Tesseract - Big Mistake! The only thing that kept me going was the thought that it had to end soon. Badly written and I've seen more substance on the side of a cereal packet - do yourselves a favour and bypass this one."
2,"Two stars is a bit generous, but...","I really wanted to like The Tesseract, and I couldn't have been more excited when it was released. The Beach is one of my favorite novels (if not my absolute favorite), so I fought through The Tesseract, waiting and hoping it would get interesting, but I made it to the last page and just thought, ""what a waist of my time this read was."" Again, I really did want to like it, and I understand what Mr. Garland was trying to accomplish with the whole ""Tesseract"" thing, but a decent storyline was lost in the process. Basically, I felt it didn't flow well, the characters as well as the stories were not interesting enough, and the ending was not worth the journey. Unfortunately, though Mr. Garland has written one of my favorite novels, he has also written one of my least favorite novels. I gave The Tesseract 2 stars because I have faith in Alex Garland as a writer and still look forward to reading his other works."
5,the best book since 'the beach',i thought 'the tesseract' was really cool- i haven't read a good book in ages! i really liked the idea of changing between different characters. i felt as if i was actually in the story because it was so well written!
1,At least the synopsis was entertaining.,"After reading the synopsis, I was sold on the idea of reading this book, which I then did over the painstaking period of a month. This book was easy to close and quite uninvolving, mainly due to the large amounts of unnecessary padding, and the simple fact that the story doesn't really go anywhere of interest. After finishing the book I was cross I had wasted my time reading it, and equally cross at the fact Mr Garland had bothered to induce such an awful attempt of literary art upon us, when he could have just sent it to the film companys, and kept us out of the equation."
4,Very Tight.,"After spending all last year giving ""The Beach"" to friends and telling them how good it was, it's nice to finally have another book to rave about. Something about Alex Garland's writing really speaks to me. I finished ""the Tesseract"" felling as I had when I finished ""the Beach"", like it was a book I wished I'd written myself. Its simultaneous allowance for stark reality, comic-book fantasies and mythological backgrounds, is really stunning. There's so much to this book, and all the real-time action takes place in maybe half an hour. I don't think that this is better or worse than ""the Beach"", I just think it cements Garland's reputation as a serious writer of fiction for my generation, and I'm already looking forward to his next book."
3,"A classic formula, with an interesting setting","Alas for Alex Garland, this novel lacks the grittiness and complexity of 'The Beach'. It's actually quite a good plot, but his misses the mark with the telling - falling back on the old formula of a single incident told by several characters. One suspects he's looking to sell the story to Hollywood. The novel certainly has a screenplay feel, and lacks depth of character. Nevertheless, it's worth a read if you don't take it too seriously."
1,Uh-huh. And what did the tesseract have to do with anything?,I read this through only because I hate leaving a book unfinished. At the end I was still waiting for an explanation for the title and the appearance of the hypercube. Zero stars if 'twere possible.
1,The Book Would Have Made Two Good Short Stories,"Oh, what a pain it was to finish this book! After reading and enjoying The Beach, I bought The Tesseract without even opening the cover. Sean's run-in with Don Pepe and his boys, and Rosa's life story, could have made two good short stories. I guess there's not much money in that, though."
3,Not his best work,"Alex Garland is an experimental author, whose willingness to take risks has paid off in some outstanding books. (Beach, his take on utopia is one) Unfortunately, for most lay readers, the Tesseract isn't one.By definition, a Tesseract is a mathematical construct with connective properties beyond the description of an Amazon review. The book is written in such an interwoven style. As a technical (and artistic) achievement, this is both unique and novel. As a readable thriller, not so much.Perhaps the lasting impact of the book is it predates the Montage style movies (21 Grams, Crash, City of God) who try weaving less ""mathematically perfect"" stories toghether. Again, this is a successful artistic vision, but the readability of the novel suffers. It's not one the average reader will find gripping."
4,Garland gets better and better,"For those of you who read the Beach, expect something completely different. Moving away from the theme of paradise lost, Garland weaves several stories together at different points in time. The stories vary in tone, from crime to love, and the end of the book brings all thirteen of the main characters together. While the plot is hard to describe, rest assured that anyone that reads this will be more than satisfied. Garland is at the top of his game here, created cinematic gunfights for some characters and picturesque tranquil landscapes for others. He captures the essence of all of his characters, male, female, old, young, and makes them all believable to the reader. He also, as in the Beach, succinctly summarizes foreign lands in such a way so that you can actually picture yourself there, along with each of the characters. This is a fantastic book, and I'd recommend it to anyone."
2,Garland's talent is present but often wasted this go-round.,"A bit of a bummer coming after The Beach, this one really feels like what could have been a terse, tense short-story padded with filler into a slow-moving (despite its brevity) novel. The connections at time seem strained, and the constant flash-backs and attempts at scope really just slow things down. You certainly get drawn in with the first part, but find yourself wandering considerably until a very well done payoff. If anything, though, the end of the book only shows the considerable talent Garland possess but never fully realizes this time out. But I'll still be waiting for the next one."
3,"Dissapointing, it's definately been done before","Dissapointing and unoriginal, I would have expected so much more from the man who wrote ""The Beach"". I couldn't help feeling so much more could have been done with the rather cliche and dissapointing ending, I was expecting a huge climax. The stories involved came together in a way which felt oddly familiar. Not to say that Alex Garland isn't a truly impressive new writer, which he is (""The Beach"" was one of the best debut novels I have read), but if you read this and hated it, ""The Beach"" will restore all your faith in the world. One question: Why is Leonardo DiCaprio to play the lead in the movie?"
3,Too ambitious,"The beauty of The Beach was that everything happened seamlessly, unfolding in a seemingly natural way even though the story took many unconventional twists and turns. In The Tesseract, Garland's desire to explore a more experimental narrative hurts the story in that the narrative seems forced, the story unbelievable, with too much time spent on unconvincing characters (the orphans with hearts of gold come to mind). O.K. -- not great."
2,"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper","It starts interesting enough. Manila in the eyes of a Westerner. Garland manages to capture the grit and darkness of the city I live in. Thrilling, to say the least. But when it reaches part II (Rosa's story), it sucked big time. I don't know about readers outside the Philippines, but Rosa's part reads like something out of a high school textbook. It's cliche (at least on this part of the world); the bucolic setting, the pretty lass not marrying her provincial boyfriend, making it big in the city, and so on. This setting has been written so many times by other authors and probably students as well. The third part, also leaves much to be desired and seems irrelevant (I think).On second thought, contrary to press releases, Manila isn't even integral to the story. Sure Garland (being a frequent visitor) captured the mood, the language, the mannerisms, but his novel can take place anywhere in the world. After The Beach, I'm disappointed."
1,Could I please get my money back?,"I was extremely disappointed with Mr. Garland`s second novel. Apparently he is a victim all the premature praise heaped upon him for his first novel ""The Beach"", which although I found interesting, was essentially merely a retelling of ""Lord of the Flies"". In ""The Tesseract"" Mr. Garland attempts to write in a style far beyond that which he is capable of. The unfortunate result is a ""novel"" which is is not only poorly written but actually painful to read. One gets the feeling they are reading a 12-year old`s first meandering attempt at writing fiction. If Mr. Garland decides to continue writing, I hope that he realizes that his talent is not great, and that he would be best served to write in a simpler style. All in all, I very much regret having wasted my time reading ""The Tesseract"" and would warn all others to stay away from this worthless drivel."
2,Un-realized potential,"Being a person who found Garland's well-reviewed THE BEACH to be nothing more than a re-hashing of LORD OF THE FLIES, I can't say that I was surprised with this novel. Garland's short-lived exploration of the concept of the tesseract reveals nothing more than the fact that he has fooled himself into thinking that he is the next Joyce, who explored similar ideas with his notions of parallax and metempsychosis. Some of the reviews exhibited on this page reveal that he has fooled a few others as well. Garland's lack of interest in his own characters is revealed dually in this novel, by the brief treatment that each character receives and by the narrative's oversight of the most sympathetic character, the deformed fisherman. The most disappointing part of this novel is Garland's loss of his unique descriptive style. There are no memorable phrases here to rival those such as a ""tie-dye sunset"" which appear in THE BEACH. Garland is a poor man's David Foster Wallace."
2,BOOO!!,"IF YOU LIKE ""THE BEACH"", DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. IT LEADS NOWHERE. HE BUILDS UP THE CHARACTERS AND TENSION ONLY TO END LEAVING YOU WITH NOTHING. I DON'T KNOW, BUT MABYE I MISSED SOMETHING."
3,The Tesseract,"There's no question that Garland can put pen to paper and seduce a reader into several hundred pages of story. Likewise, he does an excellent job at revealing detail and plot at a rapid pace keeping his audience hooked. His talent as a writer is what kept my attention throughout the story. The plot covers several hours of events that involve a number of characters. Unfortunately, in my opinion, he spends only a small portion of the pages on the plot, and the majority on character development and background information. Just when he delves deeper and deeper into a characters history, so much so that one's dedication to finishing the book comes into question, we're dumped back into the action of the plot. Despite the shallow plot and superfluous details provided for each character, The Tesseract is worth the read to enjoy Garland's writing."
1,Page filling at its best,"I wasn't ready to dismiss the author just quite yet, after pointless and shallow The Beach. I have never put down a book after 18 pages, until now. I will give Alex Garland credit for at least moving The Beach along, but The Tesseract's opening scene just sits there for 18 pages. I guess if I want to read a great adventure/suspense novel, I should just dust off my old Alistair MacLean novels."
1,Absolutely rubbish!,"I do not understand how this type of book can be published. Its a painful reading, an empty story and a total waste of time."
1,completely disappointing,"ALEX GARLAND SHOULD HAVE WAITED AT LEAST TWO OR THREE YEARS BEFORE PUBLISHING ANOTHER BOOK. BY THAT TIME , MAYBE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE BEACH. HE WAS A GENIOUS WHEN HE WROTE THE BEACH AND I ADMIT THAT IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORATE BOOK OF ALL TIME AND ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING LEONARDO DICAPRIO IN THE MOVIE VERSION OF THIS BOOK.BUT FORGET ABOUT THIS BOOK. IT JUST SSSSSSSSSSUCKS THE ENJOYMENT OF READING OUT OF YOUR BODY."
1,A pretentious mess of a tale,"""The Beach"" was hyped far beyond its merits. Now we're told it's to be the basis of a movie. If it were not for these facts, I doubt if this rambling mess of a book would have made it into print. Novels are stories - or should be. And they should try to do more than pose. This book's great weakness is that it has no good, new or tangible idea. But did that worry the publishers? Of course not..."
2,Life's no Beach in Manila,"What a disappointment! Less plot than the average allotment and a worrying slide towards the vogue of pretention over story.The idea is interesting and Garland writes well enough to almost get away with that alone; but not quite well enough.Read The Beach, which is a joy, and leave this on the shelf unless you're a committed Garland fan."
5,An Altogether More Intelligent Book Than The Beach!,"He's done it - and confounded his critics! The Boy can write after all - buy this book. Sell everything you have to buy this book! Ring up your friends and tell them to buy this book - you won't regret it! You have to buy this book! Alex Garland has proved his critics wrong - he really can WRITE! This is a much more ambitious book than his last one, and he's done it so well! ENJOY!"
4,Lots of adrenaline throughout,"The book isn't very long, and the pace is surprisingly quick. I found myself racing through it pretty quickly. It's a good read, really, though I haven't read The Beach and can't compare.Garland is very good at creating atmosphere, such as the thick heat of Manila, or the isolation of Barrio Sarap. Each of his characters are compelling-- I especially wanted to know more about Rosa. The crash/burn ending wasn't exactly unexpected, but it had a resonance that was surprising for such a short work."
3,"Fun read, but not much more","This book is well-written, and has an interesting enough story that it would make a great read at the beach, in an airport, or on a long weekend. Descriptions of Garland's place in literature tend to be overstated. He is no Graham Greene (at least not yet), as the publishers would have us believe. The book reads surprisingly fast, an easy 270-plus pages. Definitely worth the time it would take to read, but be wary of those trying to sell this book as ""the best"" anything. Buy it, read it, and have fun."
3,"Tries to be intricate, but comes out convoluted instead","I thought The Beach was great, and was hoping for something similar, in depth and thoughtfulness at least. But I found The Tesseract a mish-mash of characters, peppered with irrelevent dream sequences and semi-random characters. It wasn't BAD mind you - just not great, which is what I was expecting. Everyone else seems to think this book is another masterpiece, and maybe I'm just missing something - but I found it convoluted and choppy."
1,"Tired idea, worse execution","A disappointing book, despite the snazzy screen advertising. The author seems caught awkwardly between a desire to write a thriller, with its potential for movie deals and big sales, and Literature (capital L). The result is a self-conscious, ponderous tale, that never becomes exciting, and fails to be interesting at the intellectual level. Garland may want to be the next Grahame Greene, but for my money the comparison is a joke. In short, the book just doesn't justify its billing."
2,What's the point,"I'm sorry but after reading 'The Beach' I had high expectations of Garland's second novel, but after finishing it I was left with the question. What's the point?The book builds slowly, very slowly and when you finally get to what you think the point of the book is, it ends.I'm not going to write in this review aboutthe story line because as far as i could tell there's no story.Don't buy it, just re-read the beach and wait for the third book."
2,"Short, post-modernist snore","This is a very short book, which the publisher has struggled to pad with lots of white space and big type (at least in my edition); but it still manages to be dull. Yes, the opening is quite good. Some of the writing is quite good, but clearly Garland has no idea how to develop his story and shies away from anything with too much plot, as if afraid of losing his literary street cred. So he opts for a meaningless and unengaging structure with lots of jumping around between characters, and ends up with a mess. That some reviewers think this is all a sign of his being a 'serious' novelist only shows how pitifully timid and easily led most of them are. Next time, I'll pass."
2,more of a clash than a flow,"Ok so as almost every one else has mentioned the Beach ,I am not . I could see exactly where he wanted this book to go and in what format to do it , but this ,unfortunately did not happen . He tries to give a compasionate edge to the characters by explaining phases of there life. For example Jojo - where was that all going ? and again Alfredo , what was the over all reason in him apart from a tool to give us a greater insight into the street kids life and thoughts . When Alfredo's tool like job is done he is quickly dropped . He was trying to make the reader empathise with the characters and wasted a rather lot of time trying to do so. The nice touches where when the different story lines clashed and characters interacted .However this did not happen very often and when it did it was rather brief . Ending on a more positive note I still believe that Garland has the skill to do much better than this and eventually do so ."
3,"Not for fans of ""The Beach""","Having read ""The Beach"" some time ago I was elated to see that Garland had written another novel. I went into ""Tesseract"" expecting it to be similar to ""The Beach"". It isn't. At all. It's dry, sparse & moody. If you liked ""The Beach"" and are wanting another read like it, then know beforehand that ""Tesseract"" ain't it. Saying that, I must set forth this: ""Tesseract"" is a good novel. Sort of a ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Short Cuts"" in novel form. It's interesting how Garland sets up stories for different sets of characters & then has them finally interact in a showdown at the end. ""Tesseract"" is entertaining, very well-written and altogether a satisfying read. I enjoyed it. Just not as much as ""The Beach"". And that's the problem when a reader comes to a novel with a mindset or an idea of what to expect. If you pick up the book not expecting it to be ""The Beach"" all over again, I think you'll like it."
4,another good book from a good author,"The Tesseract is a great read, the first story is set with action, a shoot out between philippino gang members and merchant seamen. The second, is the story of a mother putting her children to sleep in the suburbs, while she reflects on her own life and her first love. The last story is about two thirteen year olds who sell their dreams to a young psychologist. In the final act all these stories are inter connected, and it makes for a good story. This has been done before, and probably better, but still Garland is an important young writer and this Novel is proof of it. IT IS NOT THE BEACH, but it is still entertaining."
3,Surprised,"As it seems I'm not the only one who went into reading ""The Tesseract"" expecting it to be something like ""The Beach"". Well, as many have stated it's not, and I was not too sure what to think of this book. It's definitely far more complex than ""The Beach"", and I'm pretty sure I didn't get the real meaning . What I made of it was that it's a story that shows how coincidences change our lives, and I think that is a bit of a problem for some of us: if I reflect upon it, most books give you the feeling that there's an explanation for everything, and this one doesn't. That's what makes it so strange, I guess, because we're looking in books for something we can't have in life - logical explanations, causes for the terrible things that happen."
4,A good depiction of the Filipino culture,"As a Filipino living in Manila, The Tesseract served as an interesting non-Filipino interpretation of the culture. Garland's relatively deep understanding of that is clearly seen. When I find myself in some of the places mentioned in the book or see a couple of street children the story becomes more alive and more real. For those of you who have read it, I have seen a couple of Totoys hanging around the McDonalds at Ermita."
5,Arrived Quickly,Arrived quickly along with the other plants I order at the same time from this company. I like that they packaged them together. Seems to be in very good condition. Growing instructions are included. Well packaged.
4,Does the job - well worth the price,"Note that though it is advertised as ""Arnold"", it is the MTD-brand mulch kit. Easy to install, though the instructions for the 38"" deck have you trying to install it backward, which is impossible unless you start drilling a bunch of unnecessary extra holes. (That's the reason for only four stars.) Once you figure out that you need to just line up the holes the only way they fit and put in the screws, you're home free. No more big clumps of grass; no more raking! It does a very nice job on the lawn. Of course you need to follow the standard guidelines for mulching--no wet grass or super-long grass. If necessary, side discharge operation can be restored easily with the removal of a wing nut and bolt that hold the mulch plug in place. Happy mowing!"
4,DIDN'T FIT THE LAWN TRACTOR,"I had used this kit on my Huskie 38 inch Lawn tractor. It fit perfectly. My friend's dad just bought a Huskie 42 inch. Both models are made by MTD. WE FIGURED THAT THIS KIT SHOULD ALSO FIT THE 42 INCH, PER THE DESCRIPTION. This kit is NOT for the 42 inch tractor. It isn't even close. Speaking to the manufacturer, we found out that the model 42 inch we have, requires a different kit. So just be aware..."
4,Works well,"This adapter was not easy to install, but once it was, it was effective at mulching and conversion from bagging to mulching."
4,Good Product,I had bought a used riding mower and needed a mulching kit. The kit was easy to install and does a good job. It makes a huge difference compared to just using the side discharge.
1,Mulcher Kit,They Did Not Give Years It Would Fit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I Sent It Back And Had To Pay Shipping It Was Not MyFault That It Was Listed Like That Shouldnt Have Had To Pay For Their Wrong Listing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Not all that great.,"Have got to use my mower since I instaled, instaling was a pain. The holes were pre drilled in my deck for this item. But it took a lot of working to get the plates to line up. Once I got the hole lined up the plates wouldn't set flate against the bottom of the deck. It just seem to me to be of poor quitly metal."
4,MISSING PARTS,"Not happy. Item was shipped missing screws, plug and instructions. I purchased this item mainly for the plug. If the manufacturer insists that we must purchase the entire kit they should insure that they SHIP the entire kit that I paid for.ADDED: Contacted Amazon and within hours had shipped another order. We had it within days all parts included. Great customer service from Amazon!"
3,it works,"Everything seemed to fit fine. I'm just not sold on mulching yet. This may be due to the lawn mower that I chose. It just seems to loose all lift when the mulch plug is installed. Therefore, it seemed that some of the grass didn't get cut. Like I said, this may have more to do with the mower than the mulch kit."
5,a need to read Hamlet,"very helpful and saved me a lot of time understanding the play. 6 dollars are definitely nothing, compared to it."
1,Does Not Contain Footnotes to Explain Words,"Just a warning, unlike many editions of Shakespeare's plays aimed at a wide audience, this one does not include glosses at the bottom of each page to explain the meaning of archaic language.I tried to check this before I bought the book, but the sample only contained the introduction. :(So unless your Shakespearean vocabulary is top-notch, maybe this edition isn't for you."
1,What,"I never purchased this item, so make sure you're not being charged for something you didn't buy. I'm not really sure what to say, but watch your purchases."
4,Book Review,"Overall, this piece of literature is filled with adventure and drama along with some action. However, I could not identify much of the content because of the difficulty in understanding what I was reading. I am not a very strong reader in the first place and the style of language just led to confusion and frustration. I realized that there were different versions of movies that reenacted the play and once I watched through the play a few times the actual text became clear. Although I had to watch a movie on the play, I would agree that this is a great play that consists of action and suspense."
2,Hamlet,"This book was a little over my head. If I was a little older I can actually see myself enjoying the book. The translation along the side was very helpful and I was able to understand the text better because of it.Some parts were creepy. I was literally creeping out when Hamlet started making out with his mom. Of course I realized that that was hundreds of years ago and maybe back then that was OK. This story provded us with a look at what literature used to be. I think this a good story to read in class. Hamlet also gives kids a new vocabulary. Many of the words in it were unfamiliar and old. I give this book 2 stars, because it is difficult to interpret."
2,Hamlet Review,"This book was pretty boring. Its very long and I don't really get the point... The modern version text makes it a little easier to understand but I still didn't like it very much. I have never really liked Shakespeare because of the words and difficulty to understand the story. It was easier just to watch the movie instead. I guess you might like it if you're a big fan of shakespeare but if you don't want to read a long, boring book, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,helpful,"I have my degree in English... I like reading and teaching with this version as ""help"" not as a substitution. It gives a clearer understanding to Shakespeare for people who have difficulty with it."
5,Great for studying Hamlet!,I had to use this for a course I was taking. This book was very clear and very helpful. It definetely made reading Hamlet a lot clearer and simpler.
3,Hamlet was a good play But...,"I thought that this version was easily reading because of the layout of the book. It allowed you to see what was ment by the book on the side pages. It was well written, but could of been a little diffrenet in the fact of how the players was not as long as I thoght it should be. I enjoyed most of the book before all the people died and no one lived. I think that Hamlet should of left one of the People alive in the play to make it more exciting at the end. But besides that I thought it was a good play. I like how the death of Hamlets father was dragged out threw they entier play until they end when Hamlet makes all the people sufer that were involved in his death or the cover up of his death"
2,travis' review,I felt that Hamlet was detailed and complicated throughout the storyboard. It had both action and suspence throughout the book. On the other hand I felt that Hamlet was too detailed and confused me. The old English didn't help one bit. It confused me more. I had to read this in English class my 12th year in High School. So this is propably why I didn't enjoy it. The story itself was a love tragedy and i don't like that kind of storyboard. I recommend reading this book in English class but not on my own free will.
2,Scott's Hamlet Reveiw,"I felt that Hamlet Prince of Denmark was a very interesting book. I had a hard time understanding some parts because the subject matter was hard to follow. I believe that Shakespeares work is unparallel to any other. I didn't enjoy it because of the use of the ""old"" English. Some parts of the story were hard to follow because of this English. Other than that i felt the plot was good and had much information expressed. Almost too much information to the point of confusion."
5,Simply the best play every written,"If there was any one novel or play which defines Shakespeare as the greatest writer in the English language, that play would be Hamlet. In it, Shakespeare combines comedy, tragedy, drama and philosophy all with stunning and unimaginable grace. The author's ability to manupilate the English language into such poingnant speech is truly astounding, and there is no better example of his abilities than in Hamlet."
2,For dummies only,"This 2-star rating is based not on the content of the original, which is quite good, but on the absurd ""modernisation"". Really, kids, why not just watch 'Friends'?"
3,Hamlet paperback,"I am in an English Honors class and we studied Hamlet in class. This book was helpful in understanding the language of Shakespeare, but I think the book could have made better footnotes on certain concepts in the book. The publisher does make up for this by inserting a few essays which were helpful in writing my review paper. Overall I give this a 3 star rating due to the lack of better footnotes."
4,Appropriate for Young Students or Reluctant Readers,"This 31-page book is rich in colorful, authentic illustrations which give it high visual appeal. It begins with background on the Elizabethan period and then gives a summary of the play broken into sections that match the acts in the play. Descriptions are also provided of the main characters. It is a useful resource for giving students an overview of the play before reading the complete text, or for reluctant readers."
2,Hamlet Review,"This book was pretty boring. Its very long and I don't really get the point because everyone dies in the end anyway. The modern version text makes it a little easier to understand but I still didn't like it very much. I have never really liked Shakespeare because of the words and difficulty to understand the story. It was easier just to watch the movie instead. I guess you might like it if you're a big fan of shakespeare but if you don't want to read a long, boring book, I wouldn't recommend it."
3,"Hamlet ""A great joy to read""(sarcastically speaking)","I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes to interpret books. Shakespeare is old and the old English language is hard to understand. The Modern English version still can confuse the most developed minds. It is a great book to read in High School but not Junior High. The book can be interpreted in many different forms, which can also make it very difficult to come up with a straight answer. Fights broke out over who could interpret the book better. So it's not a good idea to read it in a classroom."
4,"An ambiguous play, the reason for countless years of study.","After reading this play, playing the part of Hamlet on stage, and after reading countless numbers of critical material and comments, I still am baffled as to why Shakespeare, a master of play writing could display to the world one of the most confusing tragedies ever to take centre fold in literature today. Even after watching the performance on stage, or having seen film adaptations, not one could ever be certainly correct. However it is a fabulous play, and may be brought to life in so many varieties and styles. I love Shakespeare's work and I will keep reading it until I have a perfect picture of what he was trying to achieve."
2,Not a Kindle Edition of Hamlet,"While it's great to have the front matter and essays included in Signet's paper copy of Hamlet, this Kindle version of the text includes almost no links. There was no easy way to navigate from one scene to the next. Explanatory notes are identified by line numbers, but the line numbers don't appear next to the text, so the notes are difficult to decipher. Buy the Shmoop version for your Kindle -- it seems much more Kindle-ready."
3,Hamlet,"I found this book very helpful. It presented the story of Hamlet in a way I could comprehend it. I was very glad I could read the original version then read the modernized version on the other page. This story was interesting. It laced adventure in some areas though, but for the most part it kept me on the edge of my seat. I would definatly recommend this series to anyone who wishes to read Shakespears great works without a lot of hassle."
4,two enthusiastic thumbs up.,"This is a good copy of Shakespear's Hamlet. The Begining took a little while to get going and was slow intruduceing the characters and plot. At first the ghost did not make any sense till one finds out the story line. The ""Mousetrap"" was a good way for Hamlet to insure his susspisions that Claudius was the one that killed his father. The ""Moustrap"" was also a fundamental developement in the plot. It also gave way to the end of the play and the deaths of all the main characters.The last Act was very suspensful and dramatic. The dual scene is a very good example of Shakespear's ability to conjur a tragedy and make it plausable. The end was good because every one died and it left no loose ends for one to wander about because they were all DEAD. There was only one unexplained part of this play and that was wheather or not Ophelia killed herself or not. For if she did not then that raises some questions on how would killer her and why?"
3,Hamlet Review,"We believe the Hamlet was an interesting book and was a very well organized version of the play. The act where Ophelia becomes insane was the best written part on the whole book. The book was difficult to read, but in the end it was well worth it. Also, the battle part of the book were well written. We did have a little trouble understanding most of the book, but after rereading it a couple times, it made sence. Our favorite characters in the book were Ophelia and Hamlet. They were the most well written parts in the whole play. Our overall opinion on the book was that it was well written and grabbed your attention."
5,Good notes,"This is obviously Hamlet, but it also has extra notes that helps the text come alive to the modern reader and makes the Elizabethan more understandable."
5,A great lesson.,"I read Hamlet for my English class in HS. I loved the play because of the variety of lessons you can get from the play. For me, Hamlet proves that nurture has as much to do with perception as nature. Hamlet’s adaptation, and the subsequent change in something as fundamental as perception, makes us realize the importance of being conscious of our actions. Acting how one wants to be could not only let one be true to one’s desires, but could influence how one sees the world, and then subsequently acts. This is an important reminder for a society filled with people acting ruthlessly now in hopes for a better future for themselves: a strategy that Hamlet demonstrates doesn’t work."
3,Portable classic,"Great for when you need to cart around a bunch of Shakespeare and don't want a huge book/ many books. Modern readers would like more help with ""strange"" words. But this suffices. At least the price is right and it has line numbers."
1,Chris' Hamlet review,"I really didn't enjoy reading this book and I wish that our English teacher wouldn't force my class to read this play. Nevertheless I finished it. I think that the story is very complex and complicated and consist of a huge amount of details. This bunch of details really confused me sometimes so that I had to look on summaries of it. If anybody would like to read it I would recommend to do this in an English class so that you can trade information so that it's easier to comprehend this play. I think that Shakespeare did a pretty good job, though."
3,Reluctant prince eventually avenges his murdered father,"If your father's ghost dropped by one day and told you to kill your uncle would you do it? It's a pretty big step. Can you picture yourself killing your uncle? And he's the king no less. Alright, there are no kings in America. So say your uncle is the governor. Would you kill him? Hamlet had a lot to think about before going into action. So would I. Well, what the hell, blow him away."
1,"I feel asleep, it was so boring!","This book is very boring and doesn't say much for the man who wrote it! Ofcourse Willy is acclaimed as the best writer of all time, but this is only because of British Media hyping the man, after 400 years."
3,'Thou Shalt not read',"I don't know, was this book "" To good or not to good?"" Somewhere in between I guess. Hey give me credit I'm only Twelve years old. Well anyway, this book was not so bad. As Shakespeare Mentioned in Hamlet. "" All leave the room exept Hamlet"" Or something like that. I have good advise. Read this if you truly understand it, by all Means who am I to judge. But here are some of the books that are the best books in the world.1. JANE EYRE (Charlotte Bronte'2. EMMA (JANE AUSTEN3. WUTHERING HEIGHTS (EMILY BRONTE'4. LITTLE WOMEN (LOUISA MAY ALCOTT5. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (JANE AUSTEN6. SOMEWHERE IN TIME (RICHARD MATHESON7. SENSE AND SENSABILITY (JANE AUSTEN8. TWENTY THOUSAND LEAUGES UNDER THE SEA. (JULES VERNE9. AGNES GREY (ANNE BRONTE'Well as you can see I'm a Bronte&austen; FanBut Shakespeare is good. So read Hamlet if you can.I recomend it."
5,it's settled.,"oh yeah. what the world needs is my opinion on ""hamlet,"" by william shakespeare. seems that the jury is still out on whether this is a good book or not. well, here it is: my seal of approval. great stuff mr shakespeare. i hope that i helped your writing career with this review. you go, guy."
4,The human tragedy seen as drama...,"I've read Hamlet in Spanish, so I guess I may have lost most of its magic. However, the translation was good enough to transport myself to Shakespeare's wonderful drama.Hamlet is so human, so well depicted that all the things said about this drama is true.I would have loved to read it in English, but it's not my native language, but I'm sure might lost many of the word meanings.This is book is very interesting to start reading Shakepeare."
4,I got this copy of Hamlet with my Grade 12 English class.,"It comes with the complete play, plus side-by-side definitions of the more obscure English words used and illustrations. Also included are essays on Shakespeare, his life, Elizabethan England and so forth to help put the play in perspective. Through high school, I had to study a total of three Shakespeare plays, the other two being Midsummer Night's Dream and Macbeth, and this was the best of the bunch. And that's considering at the end of Macbeth we watched Roman Polanski's blood-soaked movie version, and the 1935 Midsummer Night's Dream movie starring a very young (read: annoying) Mickey Rooney as puck. And if you're curious, we watched Mel Gibson's Hamlet movie. Kenneth Branagh's was still a few years away and it would've taken us a whole week to sit through that."
3,My Review of Hamlet,"My reading class read this book for an assignment. It took us about 3-4 weeks. I really did like the modern text next to the Shakespearean text. It also gave more detail than the movie that stars Mel Gibson, which is also good but they speak in the Shakespearean language so it takes some brain power to understand it. This book was very long too. It was very hard to understand in some parts. And like all tradgedy every body dies which is no fun. It needed some footnotes to help us understand what some modern words meant. I never have liked Shakespeare but this book is okay. I would definately recommend it to some one who likes Shakespeare."
4,a perfect learning resource,"this book was a great help to me because of the book format. it was easy to compare the original text and find out what it meant. the transalation was very accurate, following Shakerspeare's original words. it was very helpful to my classmates and i while we studied this WONDERFUL book. the text is right down to a toddler's reading level."
4,truly No Fear Shakespeare,"Not only does this book make understanding Shakespeare much easier, but it came WAY earlier than expected and was in time for me to use in my class."
3,Shakespeare,I read it all in one setting; it's a classic. Details a fictionalized account of the royals.
1,Let down,"Sorry but I dont understand how this book got such a high rating on Amazon.It didnt offer much help to someone with a problem - I think the title is misleading.I cant see the benefit of reading this book. Gamblers need direction and help, not just understanding.Very disappointing."
4,Gambling Addiction- a must read for addicts,"John Eades has a unique perspective as a trained psychologist and addiction specialist who lost his own position and everything else to his own addiction. The story of his recovery will not only enrich the lives of all who read it, but could well lead to more recoveries.As a practicing physician and a friend of Dr. Eades I have seen and felt his pain; and I have also seen the joy his recovery and his new career path have brought.Heed his advice. You too can have a new life!Donald M Philpott,MD"
4,Great CD but typical,"This is good music sung by a talented singer. The artist has some serious chops but there is nothing that sets her apart from any of the other artists whos sing pop/R&B. As far as the songs, they are typical of the genre, i.e. smooth ballads and with plenty of vocal calesthenics. If you want a CD to keep in rotation that demonstrates your breadth of musical tastes, but doesn't overwhelm them, this fills the bill."
5,Deeply Moving,"Even though I'm Buddhist, not Christian, I found this collection of prayers deeply moving. Amelia O'Dea has looked deeply into her own heart and found the ground that we all share, the soul-space beyond differences of creed and confession. Any survivor who reads these prayers will find sustenance."
5,A must have for any true TKK fan!,"TKK has many superb tracks, but this single defines their fast paced, depraved sounding style. I've heard this single 1000's of times (heh not really), but I must have this CD. If you have never heard this track before, or just interested in TKK, I'm sure this CD will make you conform."
2,Cuz It's NOT,"I found this CD single to be quite a let-down as compared to the tracks on ""Confessions"" (the album from which this single was spawned).The first track (""A Girl..."") starts out with an interesting beat, but then just repeats on ad-nauseum. It got really old, really fast, and I got tired of it just listening to it for several minutes in the car. The second track is just a re-work on a piece on ""Confessions of a Knife"", but stretched too thin to really offer anything new.I always give a CD a second chance, so I've listened to it a few times since and been similarly annoyed and bored with it.Stick with TKK's other stuff, and you'll be happier. Cuz it's Hot? Cuz it's Not."
2,So so...,"Very nice watch! I was thrilled when I received, set it and strapped it on. I was less thrilled when about four months later the pressure sensor (barometric pressure and altimeter) went south. This is the (my) third Casio in which this sensor malfunctioned. It will also be the last one. I still wear the watch --let's face it, how often do I need an altimeter-- but the fact irks me."
2,"great information, very predictable plot","could not finish book. I was captured by all the great factual information about sailing and the Chinese culture of the mid 1800's but as I was reading it I felt as if Mr Stewart was trying to make a story around this research. As the story unfolded, I found myself saying to myself, "" yeah, I saw that coming"" it has all the elements of a great tale, too bad it did not catch it."
3,Interesting,"Interesting, and if some of the info inside is correct, it should be verified through the scriptures - but WOW! Definitely good place to start. After watching some shows on the History channel, this book will show you there is MUCH MORE info that people NEED to know about our timeline(s)!"
5,Thoroughly enjoyable!,"I really enjoyed this sweet book and could not put it down. It is clear that the author has spent time researching the Regency period in which this book takes place and knows it well. The descriptions of the characters and setting were very rich, which brought the book to life. In addition, the plot was cleverly developed. I'm looking forward to reading Ms. June's next book!"
4,I would read this author again,"This was a very enjoyable book, and I would read this author again. The only flaw in the book was that the angst the characters went through on their way to happily-ever-after was very melodramatic compared to whatever the misunderstanding or obstacle was."
1,"Good for Mechanics, Bad for general info","I bought this because I wanted to fix the window mechanism and door lock. This manual goes into some detail about a valve job, or significant mechanical repair, but generally electrical and other things shows a poor exploded diagram. Waste."
2,cute but overpriced,"Save a couple of bucks and buy a paint with water book at the grocery store or Wal-Mart. After buying this for $3.50, I found them for $2 at a local toy store."
4,Hard to find these anywhere!!,"Got these as a gift...can't find these ""paint with color"" books anywhere....finally found them on Amazon. Appear to be just what I wanted but again, they were a gift so not sure how well they worked but assume just fine. Wish I could find more of these kinds of books because kids still seem to love them!"
1,A TOTAL WASTE.,"A CAR OF 5 RUNS OUT OF GAS.THE DRIVER GOES TO AN OLD FARMHOUSE FOR HELP.NOBODY ANSWERS.WHEN HE DOESN'T COME BACK-THE OTHERS GO LOOKING FOR HIM.THEY CAN'T FIND HIM.ONE COUPLE GO INTO A BARN TO LOOK FOR HIM.ALL OF A SUDDEN-LIGHTS COME ON.ZACK THINKS ITS HIS FRIENDS PLAYING A JOKE ON THEM-SO HE DARED THEM TO START THE ENGINE.HE HAD HIS HAND IN A MOTOR.THE ENGINE STARTS-HE LOST HIS HAND.HE DIED.LATER-DREW GOT A RAILROAD PEG STUCK IN HIS HEART-HE DIED.SO NOW THE GIRLS ARE RUNNING ALL AROUND TRYING TO FIND WEAPONS TO KILL THE KILLER.THERE WAS NO SUSPENSE,EXCITEMENT,OR ANY EMOTION.YOU KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.IT'S VERY BORING."
1,Made for TV Movies Put this Flic to Shame!!,"No joke - the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Cheesy Canadian flic!! Sorry acting. Figures Comcast Cable would have it On-Demand. I've never thought about calling to get my money back for an On-Demand film, but I just may. DO NOT BUY or EVEN RENT!! I agree, deserves 0 stars."
1,0 STARS: PURE GARBAGE!!,"""Dark Fields"" follows a typical slasher-flick formula, but the movie is so cheaply made and poorly acted that the movie comes off like a total joke! I actually sat through this entire piece of rubbish (thank goodness I saw it for free), and I can honestly say that this is a total waste of your time. If you are serious about your horror movies, you definitely need to stay clear of this kind of garbage. The direction, screenplay and acting in this movie are some of the worst I've ever seen and ranks up there with ""Tower of Blood"" as some of the worst slasher flicks I've ever seen...another sad day for the horror genre when this rubbish was made. By the way, some of the actors in this flick need to go buy some oxy or clearasil. Oh well, I keep looking for a diamnond in the rough, but all I seem to find is trash like this. Notwithstanding this kind of garbage, Horror-man's search continues...."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"I bought this movie used at the video store - what a TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! I wouldn't even give it 1 star - it deserves none! I buy alot of horror and scary movies and this is NOT one of them.1. The actors/actresses were very ""fake"" and simply had NO acting skills whatsoever! Where did they find them?2. The movie looked very low budget and filmed with a home video camera.3. I would not pay $1 for this movie.4. The only thing they spent money on was the video cover.5. If you buy this movie, don't say I didn't warn you!"
1,send this film and motorhome massacre to Pluto one way ticket,"my god, what a waste of time. this movie along with Motor Home Massacre have such cool covers that one gets really cheated! At least M.H.M. had some nude to watch,but still is crap, just as this movie is. Avoid it!!!"
3,Mm...,"Not one of my favorites by Anne Rice. Wasn't as interesting to me as her other books. Lestat seems to be a lot different than in the book Interview with the Vampire, he's almost...kind. I guess it depends who the story is told from. I disliked Gabrielle very much in this novel, that might of been why this story wasn't as intersting as the others."
5,My favorite book,I've read this book three times and it never gets boring. I enjoy the plot line so much. I enjoyed the fact that in this book Lestat is a way more likable character than Louis. The book is a bit long but every page is worth it. This book can keep you entertained for hours. I would recommend this book to anyone.
2,SLOW & BORING,"I can't believe all the positive reviews! A good book is supposed to make you forget that you are physically reading - this only happens once in this book, and it takes place in the first few pages. I kept wishing that certain characters would die so that the plot could move along. Yeeesh- you die hard Rice fans will accept anything."
4,Better late than never,"I came to read this book long after the whole Anne Rice craze and long after the movie ""Interview with a Vampire"", but I am certainly glad that I did.While a very lengthy compositon that had a tendency to drag on sometimes, Lestat still managed to capture my attention on almost every page. You realise after a while that the author is educating you for a reason. I now see her master plan and embrace it.From the streets of France to Cairo to New Orleans, this book takes you on a journey of discovery. The discovery of what it means to be the great Vampire Lestat.But I am ramble on to much. Just read the book and you won't regret it. Yes, it's rather long but worth every page."
2,A painful read,"This book had brief moments of greatness but all in all the book was dull. Anne Rice trudges on endlessly it seemed at times, trying hard to make an exciting novel, but in the end fails miserably. The best part of the book was when it ended. This book has extinguished any desires I had to read the rest of the vampire chronicles."
3,"good, but read the book!","The reason I gave this a 6 is not for the content, but for the lack there of. The Vampire Lestat is an excellant book, in fact I would probably say that it is my favorite Anne Rice novel. However, I don't think that the tapes do the book justice. To really appreciate this novel you would have to read the whole book. The tapes lack all the beautiful details of Lestat's trip to find Marius and it skips sections that give you insight into Lestat. To fully understand the other novels you must read this whole novel. DON'T TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT. Read the book, because if you don't you will be missing an extraordinary novel."
5,Screaming For Lestat,"Anne Rice's best book EVER!!!!!! Lestat's story is gory, sad and sensual at the same time"
3,Good book but not great,"I find Lestat to be an overrated character in the VC, not that I don't like him it's just that I loved him better in IWTV. AR changes alot of things around in this book just to build Lestat up, but she didn't have to do that at all, the whole Louis Lied thing is not explainable and very hard to believe, Lestat's story would have been more enduring and interesting if she had kept her original idea of him set in IWTV. There were parts in this book I couldn't read cause it was boring, his mortal life was boring, I found myself reading fragments of the story, around the time he met Marius I just skipped all the way to the end where talked about IWTV and when he was reunited with Louis etc, which was the best parts in the whole book. I realized a bit later that the main reason that part was better is because it had something to do with Louis.Lestat is a good character but I love Louis the most."
5,A wonderfully enchanting book.,"Travel though the mytical times with Lestat. Journey though old France and encounter many immortal beings.This book was simply wonderful. Lestat is an enchanting character, with emotions, even though he is a vampire. This book is for anyone who loves history, fiction, mystery, and fantasy all rolled into one. This book is in a series so it won't end here. But before you read this book you should read the first book in the vampire chronicles, Interveiw with the Vampire. This was a great book, but very hard material to read. You can't put this book down. Lestat will keep you on guessing on what he is going to do next. You never know what wiil happen to him or what he will do. Even though this book was fiction , it also had historical facts in it too. This book was great I strongly suggest you read it."
4,Intriguing,"I gave this book 4 stars because there is always room for improvement but it deserves five. Anne Rice expresses a very different vantage point for the life of a vampire. She demonstrates several views on life itself in this book that make a person think in a good way. The book starts before Lestat is a vampire which is a plus as well because you get a chance to watch him transition from human to vampire. Rice describes vampires in a way very different from any other writing I've known. It was very intriguing, a great read."
4,"Sad, haunting, and beautiful","First of all, know that you'll have things from this book running through your head long after you are done reading it. Lestat's search for love and acceptance in a world of night is beautiful and wonderfully metaphorical. Marius and the great secrets he holds, but also the millenium of sadness and loneliness he feels is a wonderful add in. It's as though he and Lestat are two kindred souls. If you have read Interview With The Vampire, this is a must read. The great fiend he seemed in that book shines through in this one, but also explains why he is that way and that he isn't really quite so evil. Even if this is your first delving into the Vampire Chronicles, you will enjoy this book."
5,A classic work,This is one of my favorite books of the series. Lestat embraces immortality and the night with the abbandon that we all wish. he has the courage to live the life of our dreams! No one will read this and not dream of becoming one of the night dwellers. Lestat makes it all look fun and like the adventure of a lifetime!
1,Fractured Lestat,"As a long-time lover of Ms. Rice's vampire chronicals, and a fan of Michael York, I ordered this audio book with confidence. Don't you make the same mistake. Mr. York's performance is hectic, hysterical and strained, and the ""editing"" of this abridged version is criminal. The tale becomes nearly incoherent in this treatment, and Mr. York deserves to be thrown into the Louisiana bayou for his part in it. Three thumbs down. All the way down."
2,Small book,"The book was fine, except that the description did not sound like a small book and I sent it back because I wanted a regular sized book."
1,awful,"I read this immediately after the first Vampire book and it was a complete repeat. Nothing new. In depth, boring explainations of humans becoming vampires and the rules of vampire culture. Just like the first book. I guess Anne stuck by this formula for the next 3 or more books about these now familiar vampire characters, but I'll never know because I will read no further..."
1,Beautiful and Passionate,"I simply love this book. It is filled with so much passion, and emotion. Every page is glowing with words. Simply a remarkable novel. Anne Rice takes on the world of vampires with full force, not just blood and evilness but a world with love and sorrow. Lestat is a remarkable characture. Anne Rice's novel ""The Vampire Lestat"" will live on through the Generations."
2,Boring,"I must say I haven't read this book. However, I flipped through it and was so bored by what I read that I put it right back on the shelf. The first book was much better. Lestat is far, far overrated, and has a very common heart. The saying 'All that glitters is not gold' definitely applies to him. There has been too much written about him already. I don't understand why Anne Rice doesn't focus on some of her other characters for once. Actually none of her books are that good, excepting the first one."
2,Stop with Interview with the Vampire,"While this second book in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles has a promising start, it soon falls apart and becomes a monotonous mess.Stop reading the Vampire Chronicles after you have read Interview with the Vampire."
4,"Slow start, great ending.","I have not read Interview with a Vampire. I have seen the movie, I think I should read the book. This book is slow to start, but a marvelous history to vampires as it plays out. I have not researched vampires, but if Rice did not herself get the Vampire history info from another source, she is definitely a genius. Her imagination is mind boggling. Great book!!"
5,Never will my feet touch bitter earth again...,"After falling in love with the demon antagonist of Anne Rice's first vampire tale, Lestat, that is, I could not help but devour each of the following novels in her majestic Vampire Chronicles. I have read ""The Vampire Lestat"" more times than I can remember; and I re-read my favourite parts often.It has a glory and an openness about it that takes my breath away; it is tender and yet powerful; killing and sustaining. It is both a lovely story and a perdurable legend; and what more can be said of great literature than that?I cannot possibly recomend this book enough to anyone who loves the gothic novel or books in general...and especially to anyone who has always wondered why evil isn't always evil and why we must all face our own darkness and light in the end."
3,Fall From Grace... sort of,"As far as book sequels go, this one is quite readable. I enjoyed the charcter of Lestat. However, the pace went slow in some parts and some characters were so dull. A worthy sequel, but far from great."
4,Not the best in the series,"Anne Rice is an amazing writer, she pulls you into the story and makes you feel like you're right there, a silent witness to the action. I catch my pulse racing sometimes as I read and its difficult to put her books down. I like how this one delves into Lestat's early life and shows why he is the way he is. But I have to say that it can be slow at times and while this is my second reading of it I now know why I had forgotten so much of it. The Tale of the Body Thief remains my favorite of the Vampire Chronicles."
4,new found vampire lover!,"After knowing the novel ""Interview with the Vampire,"" reading book 2 of the Vampire Chronicles ""The Vampire Lestat,"" was amazing. It definetly explains a lot of Lestats actions and approaches he took with Louis. This novel is an autpbiograpghy of Lestat's life and is definetly filled with alot of unbelieveable and unexpected turns. He goes from the present to the past, and in full detailed steps, he gives you the life of the vampire Lestat. I am now a new found vampire lover due to this book. It has me on the edge of my seat everytime i pick up the book."
5,A great book!!!,"This book was well written and very believeable. It seems as if vampires could actually exist and wrote this book. I really liked this book because it had vampires, rock stars, the first vampires, and the affect that mortals had on vampires in it."
4,The best in the series.,"This was the best book in the ""vampire"" series. It was well thought out and well written. It's slow at parts, but quickly picks up. It's very good."
3,Two years later....,"I struggled and forced myself to get through this one, yes for two years! I know of two others who put it down at least four years ago never to pick it back up The bad boy Lestat became so overly passionate I was hoping another character would put him out of his misery, soon! By the end I realized the whole book was setting up all those lovely characters to come in QOTD. If one choses to buy this book, I highly suggest to also buy Queen of the Damned at the same time. When I finished the book at 3a.m. I was immediately on-line ordering QOTD, and I can say that was a treacherous two weeks of waiting! If nothing else skip Lestat altogether and go right to QOTD."
2,very slow,The Vampire Lestat reads as a very slow philosophical autobiography. I've read lots of 1000 novels that move more quickly. This book is much more of a history than a story.
3,fans unite,"I didn't know anything about Lestat besides what I had seen in the 'interview' movie with Tom Cruse playing Lestat. Now, when I read about Lestat, I see TC. anyway, this is for the ULTIMATE Vampyre fan that detests anything that has to do with SPARKLES!!!!!!!!You won't find an Edward here, thank god. I much prefer these over Twilight any day of the week. I much prefer Lestat and his flamboyant persona to any sparkling gay dude who THINKS he's a vamp.This is enjoyable. READ IT. Read it!"
5,wow wow WOW!!,"'The Vampire Lestat' was the first Anne Rice I read (including 'Interview with the Vampire') and I thought it was fantastic!!!Really more of a prequel than a sequel to 'Interview' it's Lestat's story from the events that lead him to becoming a vampire, to the ones he made and the events that followed. Inside his own tale is that of other ancient vampires and their own lives. It gives a history to the myth and a voice to the characters. Towards the end Lestat briefly tells his own version of the events that occurred in 'Interview' which, along with the rest of the book, allow you to sympathise with him more than you'd ever believe you could.Although part of the horror genre I wouldn't say it's particularly scary. Instead it's full of depth and character. It had me gripped from the very beginning and wouldn't let me go until I'd finished it.A brilliant book, I only hope `Queen of the Damned' can live up to it."
5,WOW! AMAZING! WONDERFUL! FANTASTIC!,"I cannot praise this book enough! I love this book! This was the first Anne Rice book I read and it instantly made me a fan. I have read her other novels but TVL will always be my favorite. I also love the character of Lestat. Lestat will always be my favorite character. He's so human and so supernatural at the same time. I absolutely could not stop reading this book! This book takes you to another dimension. If I had a choice, I would rate this an infinite number of stars. It's that amazing! Please read this book!"
3,well actually,"I'm a bit wreary of sequels, this sounds exactly the type heading for disaster. First of all, it all sound too familiar to the 1st tale, to the point where some facts in the 1st was changed. Granted, Louis and Lestat had difference perspectives and would tell the same tale of the time they were together differently. But Lestat as a vampire with human qualities, searching for knowledge about their kind? That sounds a lot like Louis re-hashed. I liked the fact that Lestat was different, that all the characters were vampires with their own characteristics. I would have liked to hear the tale of Lestat, as he was.But, hearing all the rave reviews, I will give this book a try if it's at the library. If not, I can pass just as well."
5,"I couldn't put it down,I LOVED IT",IN THIS BOOK LESAT PURES OUT HIS LIFE AS A VAMPIRE AND HIS ROAD DOWN THE YEARS.
2,BORING,"THE ONLY GOOD POINT ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THE FIRST 20 PAGES AND THE LAST 20 PAGES. ANN RICES DOES IT AGAIN, THAT IS RIGHT TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY A WASTED READ. I FIRST READ INTERVIEW AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAID THAT IS THE WORST ONE AND ALL OF THE OTHERS ARE OUTSTANDING BOOKS, BUT AFTER READING THE 2ND NOVEL IN THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES I MUST SAY I WILL NOT READ ANOTHER. ANN RICE IS A VERY BORING WRITTER AND I DON'T SEE WHY SO MANY PEOPLE LOVE HER NOVELS. OBVIOUSLY YOU PEOPLE GIVING HER ALL OF THESE 5 STAR RATINGS HAVE NEVER READ A GOOD NOVEL."
4,Lestat = Cool. Louis = Whiny.,"This Lestat bears very little resemblance to the creature we are introduced to in Interview with the Vampire. I wanted to kick that Lestat in the crotch. This Lestat, I want to offer my neck to. While the author does try to explain pieces of his behavior in her last novel as misunderstandings and ignorance on the part of Louis, I don't really buy it. I think it would have been more congruent to character to introduce an entirely different vampire and ascribe these experiences to him.I would have liked to have had more of this book take place in the present, as I feel the conception of his musical group and his reasons for wanting to reveal himself are not really explained. While I enjoyed very much the stories of Lestat's and Marius's pasts, I felt that they went on rather longer than necessary. I read this as an e-book and even in Microsoft Reader, it was 908 pages!I am enthralled with Akasha, however, and am very much looking forward to reading Queen of the Damned."
3,So much potential...,"Vampire Lestat had a lot more potential than realized by the author I feel. Unlike Interview With A Vampire, where we are allowed to see a wide range of things from one person's perspective in Lestate, we are more hindered by his arrogant blabberings. The story is powerful, moving and potent but so overshadowed by the main character's ego that all else pales and soffocates quickly. Characters who might prove rewarding in future tales or who might add more flavour had they been more investigated are actually down played or under exposed. Nothing outshines, out classes or out ranks Lestat which is painfully clear throughout the book. He seems to over power the entire story, even when he is not the subject at hand (which albeit is rare)."
2,Not even close to 5 stars!,"I rate books three ways: it's a book 1)to forget about as quickly as possible 2)fine for a quick easy read, entertaining enough but not worth reading twice 3) amazing, unique, well written, worth reading again and again because each time the book becomes richer. Anne Rice's books are in general a 2. Her ideas are imaginative and unique, so it's unfortunate that her writing style is a little self indulgent. Interview with a Vampire was fine, but ,my God, I had to force myself to finish this second in the series. Furthermore, I find that her charcters have no depth and eventually become worn out. Plus, I have no sympathy for any of them, so it's hard to get involved with the book. However, if you don't expect a piece of literature or don't even want one, then it's fine. You won't be worse off for reading any of the Vampire Chronicals."
2,TOO MUCH LUSH EXTRAVAGANCE,"What is it with horror writers they gotta describe every object, every emotion, every physical movement down to it's grainiest detail? Dramatizing each step or raised eyebrow to the point where I had to look at myself in the mirror. How can I make my face become thoughtful and smooth and childlike all at once? Can I exude an evil and yet sensuous aura if I do this with my lips and then hold out my hand as if recieving a diamond pineapple? Is Rice trying to frighten me or drive me nuts alltogether? I don't know...I find it all very silly. As for the story itself it does bear a certain romantic gravity. And she does draw some fantastic images and pose some interesting philosophy. At times it is entertaining but the grandiloquence overwhelms. Somehow I made it through the whole thing...whatever that tells you."
3,"3 1/2 stars,....a good descriptive book,,.....","the book by it self is'nt so bad, you wouldnt know what some of the characters are but you would get the general idea of what would be going on,..but with the series i give it a 4 star, becasuse it is a pretty good sequel, it keeps up the pace of interview, some of the characters change from what they where intended to be with interview with the vampire, like armand who turns into a hateful spiteful creature, as a stand alone i might recomend the book, as a series you cant miss it,......"
5,Gripping,"After reading Interview I was left wondering what was going to happen next, and boy was I surprised. The plot was truly amazing. I never doubted that Lestat had only sought company in Louis and Claudia, but for Louis to come back to his father kept him the weak sort he was in Interview. I think every son and daughter would apprecitae Lestats love for his mother, a risk to make her one of his kind, which was well worth it. Gabrielle was given another life to be who she wanted to be, this shows Lestat's kind heart. For anyone who has not read this bok, it is a must. It will hold you in its grip until you finish it, and you will long to read The Queen of the Damned, just as a vampire needs blood to keep it going."
5,the best thing you'll ever read,"lestat suddenly is not the cruel vempire that he was in ""interview,"" now he is the hero, the beautiful, devestatingly passionate character... he is as real as any person ever was, and a part of us, he is the person we would all love to become."
5,A real review,"This book gives you a better look at the Vampire Lestat, one of the main characters in The Interview with the Vampire. But in this book he is portraied as more of a good guy than before, where he seems kind of barbaric. But it shows and explains a lot about Lestat. And the end left me trembling (in anticipation)."
2,just pointless,"This does not come close to Interview. It's probbaly one of the worst structured books Ive ever read. Its made up as it goes alng. Die hard fans would give 5 stars for anything Rice wrote so dont follow those reviews. I just dont understand how a book about vampires does not fit into horror, action, adventure, drama? It was just a story. It could have been summed up in 100 pages but instead it dragged on and on. The biggest reason I give this 2 stars is because it is narrated the exact same way Louis narrated in Interview. And it's almost like Rice picked up on this as well because over half way through it's like, ""oh by the way, Im a loving emotional guy too."" Huh? Its Louis writing as Lestat!Now I have the next book which continues the story and its twice as long. I only wish I could read as fast as Lestat, but then again I only had to read every other page in this book to know what was going on. I just skipped over the 5 paragraphs it takes for Anne to desribe a grain of sand."
2,Tedious,"In one sentence, the characters emotions tend to swing from one extreme to another leaving me, the reader, not only uncaring but bored. If I didn't have a life, perhaps it could keep my attention."
4,An absolute feast for the senses.,"The second book in Rice's vampire series is truly her masterwork. The book follows the mysterious Lestat from his birth into darkness into the life he leads as a creature of night in the most decadent society in history. Many wonderfully thought out characters appear and Rice avoids her earlier tendancies towards angst. The plot moves with alacrity through the years and does not leave you feeling the need to ""skip to the good parts"" that the previous book did.Rice originally wanted to stop writing the series at this book, but her fans would not allow it. The books after this one are uninteresting trite attemps to appease her fans and have none of the heart and work that this book does. Definitely read this book, but I would recomend you quit at this one. It literally doesn't get any better than this."
2,WHY ALL THE SADNESS?,"I loved and still do the first book ""Iterview with the vampire."" And my hopes were so high for this one....but I didn't want all the sadness, the tears..we had enough of that with Louis...and the homosexuality amongst the vampires....Why not put at least ONE female into the heart of at least ONE vampire...not a mother, or sister, but a woman he would lust for. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't mind a little passion there between a woman and a vampire.....Sorry Ann, but you've written about men lusting for each other enough for a lifetime....."
3,Alright for a Vampire Chronicle,"If you liked Interview with the Vampire and want to know about the events after the novel, The Vampire Lestat is the first one to read. It's ok, but sometimes extensive and boring. Sometimes it's hard to keep your interest in the storyline."
1,A major let down,"I loved Interview With the Vampire and I really liked Lestats character a lot so I was surprised by how Anne Rice potrays him in this book.He goes from being a complex evil character to a whiney, childesh idiot! Am I the only one that winces when he is called the ""brat prince?"" She made him cute, cuddley and mischievius in a little boy sort of way, a major difference from the Lestat in Interview. That lestat was more mysterious, although he loved being a vampire and accepted it(unlike Louis) you get the feeling that there is more going on in his mind than Louis can see. His character in The Vampire Lestat on the other hand is silly and can really got on your nerves.There is nothing at all disturbing or dark about him, you know he will never really do anything totally evil, hes too sweet and adorable too. Its not really that this book is so bad(compared to Menoch its a masterpiece)its just that if she wanted to write a book about a charming,charismatic vampire why did she use Lestat?"
3,The Vampire Lestat,"The Vampire Lestat was a good, but exhausting read. At times I found myself dosing off to sleep, but at other times, this author kept me that interested that I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. Overall, I give it 4 stars, I really like how it explored each characters' story, but the cliffhanger ending didn't really seal the deal for me."
2,lazy writing indeed,in first pages a young male has a grizzled beard. huh? VD is under control in mid 80s. right. either lestat is a moron or author is delusional about reality. Even fiction needs some basis in facts. I read this once...meh.
5,Great Effort,"Saw them open for Amon Amarth. The live show was so good bought the CD. There are about 7 solid songs on this album. As other reviewers stated, if you like Soilwork, Bodom, In Flames and like lyrical choruses pick this one up. Blue Eyed Fiend is one of my favorite songs ever. Over 200 plays on my I-Pod."
2,Junk,"Didn't work for me, uses some weird bracket to attach to older designs. The brackets are cheaply made and don't hold the handles that well."
5,Highly Recommended Interpretations,"With these performances, the music is at the forefront. This speaks very well of the artistry of Jon Manasse, whose first rate playing always serves the music. It is all too easy with Weber's clarinet works for the performer to take predominance over the music. Manasse's beautiful tone, effortless facility and lovely phrasing always puts the music first. For that reason, these are my favorite recordings of these works."
3,Great but not the best.,"This reel is great for tennis players that break the cords often because it's very hard. However, you will compromise on the feeling of the spin..."
4,Good General Non Judeo-Christian Mythological Summary,"""Mythology"" by Littleton is a rather large and picture-heavy tome of mythologies from all over the world. It covers Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, Celtic, Viking, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Native American, Mesoamerican, South American, African, and Oceanic pantheons and myth-cycles. Each section provides a neat and concise summary of the major mythological features, elements, and characters of each culture.It really is a great tome for anyone interested in keeping a mythology book on their coffee table - the pictures, photos, and information are accurate and concise in presentation.The two drawbacks I see with this book are: 1.) A lack of pronunciation guides, and 2.) An almost complete lack of information concerning Biblical/Judeo-Christian mythology.If you're looking for a nice coffee table book or have a causal interest in mythology, this is a nice find."
4,a puzzle that leaves out pieces,"i rather enjoyed this book . was mostly hermetic ideas that have been around and in other formats for a long time. so was nothing new to me. nor to you if your reading this book presumably you have seen in a smattering of the occult . i liked the writing style of joseph weed and his approach . he has a deep significant way of presenting ideas . good book but of course it leaves out certain profound truths and deeper teachings , its like a puzzle missing a lot of pieces only complaint the paper they use feels cheap in your hand, i think its newsprint , and the book its self is cheaply made which is good to keep prices low but it makes for a easly damaged book. don't take it in the bath tub :) and the color of the book ""pink"" is symbolical of course but picking this up i didnt know that and thought ""my stars what a ugly color"" but you find out later why the color pink is used in the book"
3,so-so,seems to be a compilation of different trials from a vast inventory of similar findings that are not unique to the average person.
5,"A CLASSIC FOR MUSIC, NOT JUST HIP HOP","TO THIS DAY, THIS IS MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME. People often overlook this album, but I know one thing, I was 10 years old when it was released. I'm about to be 20 and it still has the same effect on me. Tupac is the hardest. I can listen to this album no matter whats going on in my life."
5,Stunning!,"If you don't have this quintessential CD, my first question to you is: what are you THINKING! I honestly cannot say enough good things about this album. It is definitely one of the top three rap CDs of all time. If you want to know why people all over the world love this performer seven years after his death, listen to this CD, and then listen to All Eyez on Me. This is a fine example of a TRUE artist at the apex of his career!"
1,Not what was promised,The case was screwed up. Scratches everywhere!!!!!!!! The disc Was chipped. It was not what was said it was going to be.
5,Old school,This was a good price for a 2pac cd most people try to jack up the price since it is an original copy and one of his first cds I don't think I could have found a better deal so thank you!!!!
5,Pac's Best,"If you never bought a 2Pac CD then this is the one, trust a veteran hip hop head from the 90s!"
3,Me Against the World,"This album is lyrically, one of the greatest to ever be recorded. It is interesting to note the immense difference between this album, and his later works at Death Row. Nevertheless, i found this album entertaining, yet i was slightly put off by some of the beats. Also, considering that i have a chance to voice my opinion, i would like to say that ""Loyal to the game"" is a great album, and i do not see why it has recieved such widespread criticism."
5,The Greatest Rap CD of All Time,"This is the greatest rap CD of all time from start to finish. This is a CD that you can just listen to anywhere and everywhere you go. 2Pac is clearly at his best when he recorded this CD before he went to jail for a questionable rape conviction back in late 1994 but the CD was not released until the late winter of 1995. The CD starts off, na there is no need to break this CD down because if you have gone through something in your life, you can definitely relate to what 2Pac is saying. He talks about how at times it is you against the world and how we have shed so many tears when our homies were slained. Also he talks about how there are so many temptations out here and how it is growing up as a young [man] in the hood. This CD is just so real about the issues and so forth that goes on in our homes and on the streets. So my advise to you is let's carry the greatest lyricist of all-time's legacy and go buy this masterpiece."
5,Greatest Rap Album of all time,"This is the greatest rap album of all time. Pac comes through with some great lyrics on this album. Tupac is unstoppable, and I like this album better then Makaveli or All Eyez because its Pac in true form, no Suge Knight influence. He speaks what he wants to. If you are a rap fan, this is an album for you."
5,Its just me against the world,Although I am not a Tupac fan this is the only Cd of his that I really like.
3,It's aight,"I mean I really don't like the beats, they all have kind of an rnb feel. also i dont really like his flow, he says it to hard and doesn't sound right because of the beats. But if you like his flow you should buy it."
2,ugh,"2pac really was a great artist and he deserves all the credit hes getting, but this album really lacked. i wanted to like it. i listened to it and really tried to like it! but it was just BORING. i think the subject matter and the situation pac was in does add another dimension to the album.. but the music just doesnt back it up. ah well. i still love pac but this is one of his few weak albums."
2,The Luv for Tupac,"2Pac is the best rapper known. His music explains exactly how i feel everyday. I relate to his music and his feelings. His song :Me Against the World"" explains what it is like to be separated from everything around us. It shows us the truth about how people discriminate and classify people. Tupac is the best artist out there because he is REAL and his music comes from the deep dark truth of how life really is on the other side of the tracks. I love you Tupac!"
1,HATE IT,"personally, i think this iz da worst album he az ever done. I thought it would be betta. the only songs i like is me against the world and dear mama, THAT'S IT, the rest just absoluteley SUCK, disgraceful, the worst music I've ever listened to. this cd is not worth a penny, it stinks, period"
5,AMAZING THROWBACK CD!,I was hesitant to buy an old 2Pac CD in fear it would be an unauthorized copy but it was the real deal. Thanks.
5,pac is the realest!!!!!!!!!,"THIS ALBUM IN MY OPINION IS ONE OF HIS MOST DEEPEST AND PASSIONATE OTHER THAN MAKAVELI. the two ALBUMS ARE ALMOST TOTAL OPPOSITES OF EACH OTHER. IN ME AGAINS THE WORLD HES TALKIN BOUT GETTIN OUT THE GAME SETTLIN DOWN. GIVIN THE YOUNG G'S SOME KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM ON THE GAME. IN MAKAVELI HES TALKIN BOUT RIDN ON FOOLS, KILLN FOLKS, TELLIN THE YOUNG G'S TO FOLLOW HIM DO AS HE DOES RIDE FOR HIM. ME AGAINST THE WORLD WAS A GOOD PIECE OF REFLECTION FOR THE MAN WE ALL KNEW AS TUPAC SHAKUR!"
5,It Ain't Easy,I think this is a very good album with amazing songs and Lyrics. Making this album probably was not easy at all because it was so well produced that you jsut want to play this cd 24/7. I recomend this album to everyone who likes old school rap and some of the newer stuff. Anyone who buys this CD will really enjoy it.
5,Dead but Still Living Through His Albums,"It's really hard to rank 2pac's albums against each other because they are all so good (at least the ones before he died). So I'll just start by saying that this is another excellent 2pac album. The great thing about this album is that the songs that you used to hear on the radio when this album came out are good as well as the songs that you didn't hear. Only the best albums have this mix. Most of the time one or the other category of songs is not so good. Songs such as ""Me Against the World"" and ""Dear Mama"" that were played often are still classics. And so are songs that weren't played so often such as ""Outlaw"" and ""Heavy In The Game"". This album is just full of good beats and classic 2pac lyrics. I would recommend it to any hardcore hip-hop fan."
5,africa,"this is an indication that this man's spirit shall be with us forever. ""MAY TUPAC REST IN PEACE AND THE REST OF US LIVE IN IT"""
5,an incredible abum by mr.tupac shakur,the one thing i like about this album is tha lyrics and beats.my favorite song is IF I DIE 2 NITE.the beat is bangin and pac's rymes are hot.i do not have the album but i wish i had it.any body want to BUY ya boy the album so i could bang it?but the album is just hot and makaveli will neva be forgotten.RIP.
4,"It took awhile, but we did it","My wife and I are both 69 years old and not really great at putting stuff together, but in less than three hours we had it assembled. It really looks good, and I think it's a great value for the price. The instructions are bad, but if you study the drawings awhile you can figure it out. All the holes lined up perfectly. Also go to Amazon and keep looking at the big picture of the completed stand. That also helps. Lay everything out before you start.Good luck!!"
3,Serves It's Purpose,"It wasn't too hard to assemble but the tower stand leans toward the inside. I tried reshaping the metal bars it sits on, but the only way to get the screws in place is for it to lean a bit. It is generally easy to move around the room when rearranging furniture. But it doesn't fit through doorways unless you take the main desktop piece off. Not too hard to do. It definitely works and has held up pretty good over the last 8 months and I have 3 really rough kids."
3,George Huff is an extremely good entertainer!,"His music is deep, the music is slow-paced R&B. Which is fine but isn't everyone's cup of tea. You have to be an easy-listening mode, for me, it's kinda boring but others may really enjoy this album. Real Love is probably the most entertaining track & the kind of thing I could see him performing! but he has a soothing voice & is one of the nicest guys to come on AI! I don't think he could've won AI but I think he could've gone a little further but that's the past. but it's really up to the listeners tastes in music, I was just glad to support him when I bought his album!"
1,This CD SUCKS!!!!!,"This fake attempt to lure the gospel audience due to the fact that he couldn't ink a R&B deal sucks! Good voice, but no passion. If you gonna do gospel, you need to live the life and be anointed! No feeling!!!"
5,Pleasantly Surprised!!!!!!,"Wow, this Cd was such a pleasant surprise, I have a hard time listening to some gospel music because some have alot of screaming or the music is just too dull or noisy, but this CD kept me listening and singing the whole time, George Huff's voice is fantastic and some of the songs are so smooth. I can't wait for his next gospel CD,. thank you George!!!!!"
2,Quality of Angel body lotion has declined,"Angel body lotion used to be so creamy and dreamy when it was in the squeeze bottle.Years ago, one small dab would leave an enchanting scent that would only go away when washed off.In the pump bottle, it is a watered down, weakened fragrance.And it seems to get worse every time I order.Nothing against the vendor; the shipment arrived super fast and nothing was damaged.But the texture of the Angel lotion is thin and the scent is disappointingly weak -- barely there even if I lather it on.The vendors show the picture of the squeeze bottle, but 4 out my last 5 orders came with the pump bottle instead of the squeeze bottle pictured."
2,DID NOT RECEIVE THE PRODUCT THAT I ORDERED,"I DID NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT THAT I HAD ORDERED, I HAD ORDERED ""ANGEL--CELESTIAL BODY LOTION"" WHICH WAS THE PRODUCT THAT WAS SHOWN ON LINE, WHAT I RECEIVED WAS ""ANGEL PERFUMING BODY LOTION"" NOT AT ALL WHAT I WANTED--SO I GAVE IT TO MY FRIEND, HAD TO ORDER FROM ANOTHER SITE TO GET THE CORRECT ORDER. VERY VERY DISAPOINTED--THE PRODUCT SHOWN WAS NOT THE PRODUCT SENT.IN THE FUTURE I WILL ORDER FROM THE OTHER SITE, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SENDER SENDS OUT THE PRODUCT THAT IS ADVERTISED, AS THESE TWO PRODUCT ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER, MADE BY THE SAME COMPANY, THIERRY MUGLER,,,BUT NOT THE SAME PRODUCT."
1,Disappointing,Very disappointed. The suggestions are dated and repeated. Wish I hadn't bought it even at a good used price.
4,Good for assisting in building a foundation,"I am using this in conjunction with other sources. I listen to it to get a better grasp on pronunciation. However, I also purchased a good book (Portuguese in 10 minutes a day) as well. I tend to like underlining things and making notes etc, so for me a good book was a necessity; as well as reference material, such as a book of verbs, and a dictionary. I am close to halfway through the CDs and it is excellent for teaching you how to say certain phrases competently. But I want to learn more than canned questions and answers. Besides, if one has memorized the phrases and responses by rote, they would probably not be able to carry on a conversation if the subject matter changes. I intend to get a good grasp on the basics to begin with, and then proceed to an intermediary level, so I am using this CD series as well as some written material too."
2,Disappointed,"While the audio portion of the program is fine, there is no workbook as is referred to in the audio. This makes it a bit frustrating, knowing that I'm missing out on the important reading part, especially with a language like Portuguese."
5,esta bem,I am planning a trip to Brazil next summer to see friends so I thought I would brush up on my Portuguese to surprise them. I spent some time there as a foreign exchange student in high school a million years ago and already spoke a little (very little after so many years) so this course was a bit of a review for me. I found it very helpful and easy to follow. The lessons did hold my interest and covered a good bit of ground with a lot of emphasis on proper pronunciation. I agree with other reviewers that for some just learning Portuguese it would be helpful to see the words in their written form since Portuguese doesn't always sound like it looks. A vocabulary list would be nice. I plan to continue with the series although I think it is a bit expensive.
3,It's ok.,What I like is the repetition which reinforces learning. Unfortunately what I also don't like is the repetition. The dialog moves really slow-and repeats the same phrases over and over. The pace could be a lot faster. The CDs help kill some time in traffic.
3,Portugal,"With few exceptions , I could follow conversations .Being a French Canadian this was my first trip to Portugal .However I would have much prefered conversational Portuguese IN Portugal ."
5,Pimsleur portuguese,"Portuguese is my third language,I listened to this series on my way to and from work .till now I learned till the ninth CDI am now in Brazil,I can communicate with the brazilero(the local residents)in a basic level,however they are amazed that I speak with no accent,I can explain more or less what I want,it is funI am going to complete the series,and continue to the next levelhope this review helped!"
2,"long-winded, English, egocentric, white man's burden","Remarkable for the long-winded speeches on the nature of religion between a fake swami, an American missionary and a couple of English officials, sometimes with an Indian judge. The speeches go on for pages; one of the most amazing was five pages long without a single paragraph break. I found this book in a used book store in Italy, and bought it because of the review by Mr. Cohen. I guess my problem is I don't like Rushdie either."
2,"Le Creuset 2-1/5-Quart Covered Heart Dish, Red","A completely versatile container for your cooking,freezing, and storage needs. I've owned this product for just a few weeks, but it appears to be very durable and should provide continued service for years to come. Highly rated!"
4,Too Many Acoustics,"Marc Bolan and his band T. Rex helped define and make popular the glam scene of the 70s. This disc is a greatest hits that has a couple electric, but the majority are acoustic versions of the songs we know and love. Even though this is a bit of a bummer, it is not a bad thing. Bolan knew how to write a song, meaning no matter how they are played they still rock. If you are a T. Rex fan already buy to see if it tickles your Bolan taste bud. If you are a newcomer to T. Rex, then i suggest buying another Best Of, or buy their best album: Electric Warrior."
4,my experience,"hello, Bosch pump works perfectly on my 2001 v6 mustang, although at first I saw was not exactly like the original and perhaps would not work after the installation I was told that it has different features have been improved from the original ;)"
3,Filter Strainer,Good product but I would have rated it higher if I had known it wasn't coming with the Filter Strainer that I need for it. It says must be used with new strainer not included or it voids the warranty.
2,Unsatisfactory for Koss,"I can't remember why I purchased these, but I don't use them anymore. From the first time I tried them, I noted that they were uncomfortable and the sound quality was mediocre; not what I would expect from Koss.If you're looking for ear buds, I suggest trying the in-ear-sealing type--Several years ago, I was turned off by that type because I never liked putting stuff in my ear. I quickly grew accustomed to it though and now appreciate the sound quality and isolation that those offer compared to these (P15) type. If you don't want sound isolation, then I suggest looking at over-the-ear headphone sets. For example, the Koss PortaPro's are likely the best sounding headphones I've ever heard (my personal favorite).Generally I would avoid these unless you are set on getting the hard-plastic standard-ipod-type headphones, to witch these would probably compare a little more favorably."
2,"Bad design, short life-span, mediocre sound.","I've had these for about 6 months and the left earphone just gave out. Maybe I was just unlucky, but that is unacceptably short life-span for earphones like this.The phones are also a little too big for my ears; actually they are a bit larger than the standard iPod phones so if you think those are too big, stay away from these.Besides, the sounds on these is really quite mediocre. It's not terrible, but there's very little bass and poor mid-range definition. Again, the only other earphones I've owned recently are the standard iPod phones, and those have a much better sound that this one.I'm looking to replace these now that they've given out, and I'm certainly going to buy something different this time."
1,sound as cheap as they are,"tinny, no bass whatsoever, they just sound bad. they are also uncomfortable because of the way they are shaped and don't fit well."
5,Just try and stop your feet from tappin',"If you've been feeling like you're missing some down and dirty rock and roll in your life, here is your intervention. Combining rockabilly with country, with flaming rock and roll, Deke Dickerson sets the stage on fire. I bought the cd looking for something fun to drive to, and now it holds spot number 4 in my cd changer...and never leaves!!!"
5,Excellent Janis material!,"This is an excellent 2-disc set! I especially like the ""Early Performances"" disc before Janis really made it big. Definitely a worthy purchase."
3,Tough going,"This is a comprehensive history of human progress so far in exploring space, and a discussion of possible future directions. However it is of more use as a reference book than as something to read for entertainment, or to inspire one with the possibilities. (If that's what you want, read ""The Millennial Project"" by Marshall Savage.) The writing style is very dry and academic. Also, many of the illustrations are very fuzzy and of poor quality, as though scanned in with a cheap scanner at the lowest resolution."
5,We love Jeff! But . . . .,"I got my son all 4 of the Wiggles dolls, and since Jeff is his favorite he got him first.Within minutes I decided to do a little ""surgery"" on Jeff. He was way too loud, and I knew it would soon get on our nerves, so I removed his battery/speaker pack (which was difficult because it's tightly sewn in). I managed to get it out, and put tape over the speaker, so Jeff now sings in a much more pleasing volume. I have a feeling I'll be doing this to the rest of the Wiggles too.Second problem - the paint on Jeff's hands is wearing off here and there. Of course this doesn't take away from the fun, but I expected it to be more durable as a Children's toy.Overall, if someone in your house is a Wiggles Fan, these dolls are a must-have. They say ""Hi my name is . . . "" and sing a couple songs, my son loves taking Jeff wherever he goes."
2,Disappointment on Christmas,I bought this doll four months before Christmas and stocked it back for my 2 year old for Christmas. When I tried it out on Christmas at 2 in the morning I discovered that my Jeff doll had a split personality and thought he was Anthony. I am still trying to get the toy company to replace this doll. This doll says all the things Anthony is suppose to say. My daughter thinks Jeff is crazy.
2,"Vigilance, Readers!","In fairness, I have not yet finished the book. Yet I am already disappointed that so little was included about the European ideological and theological heritage that went into the Articles and the Constitution. Also, very little was said about the motivations and concerns of the Anti-Federalists.The layout is attractive and easy to read. At times, the information content per paragraph is low. Some of the incidents are interesting or good cocktail party fodder, but they seem to shy away from presenting thought provoking material without accompanying commentary. In other words, I feel they don't trust the reader to think for him/herself.The authors manifest their views everywhere but do not admit that they are opinions or discuss how the presentation is crafted around those opinions. As with any book, it is important to recognize the authors' goals and rationale."
3,A long and difficult journey to finish...,"This book is hard-core psychoanalysis stuff. If you are not a therapist, or buying this book for one, you may want to steer clear! I read, identified with, and enjoyed 'True Selves', but I found very little in this book to be considered new information. Other than a course lesson in ""grounded theory"", which I had no intention of recieving, this book was a snore-fest. I give it a good rating for it's quality as a teaching text, but again, steer clear if you are not into psychoanalytic thoeries.Kate"
4,Charming and British with Dark Undertones,"Hilary Mantel has written a small, delightful little book in the novel, Fludd. The title character, Fludd, arrives in the village of Fetherhoughton and , both subtly and drastically, changes things at a crucial time for the local priest, Father Angwin, and the Catholic Church. This is background for a wonderfully eccentric group of characters that charm their way through the book. I initially picked up the book because of an interest in the historical Robert Fludd, the alchemist, but discovered that it was the quirky denizens of this village that captured my heart and were the driving force behind the book."
4,A Bit of Fun,"This brief novel is a fun way to spend a few hours. It's centered around a church in the periphery of a Catholic diocese in the 1950's and peopled by a number of odd characters with a connection to the church--a gaggle of nuns, the parish priest whose the worse for drink and faith, a nosy rectory housekeeper, a progressive bishop with a secret. And, of course, there's Fludd himself, who shows up at the rectory one night and becomes the pastor's assistant. Who (and what) Fludd really is is the core of this novel's interest.For the Catholics who read it, this book brings out a lot of things to think about but doesn't bang you over the head with them. It's always a fun novel and never a philosphical lecture. For the time it takes, it's certainly worth a read."
4,This is a really good read. Mantel succeeds again!!,A very engaging plot. I liked all the characters and the writing was superb. I would recommend this without hesitation.
3,Very Good Book in the Muriel Spark Tradition,"I like this book much better than the better-known ""The Giant, O'Brien."" It's a well-written fable in the whimsical, Muriel Spark tradition. It has flashes - though only a few - of real profundity. I especially like the parts featuring the tobacconist, and I think the author does a wise thing when she makes him A Demon, instead of THE Demon. She isn't Muriel Spark (who is?), but this is a spirited effort in that direction."
4,Entertaining & Thought Provoking,"My wife and I read Fludd and enjoyed it thoroughly. It was very entertaining--but not quite as strong as some of her other work (e.g. Wolf Hall).The mysterious elements in the story added to the book's charm, but the characters and subplots were strong enough to carry the novel on their own."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"This book was actually a disappointment to me, I had high hopes, but those hopes were not met, this was the first Hilary Mantel novel I had read, and I expected more ""supernatural"" than was delivered."
5,Fludd,"Hilary Mantel has a way of writing that catches the readers attention, and if like me.needs to be read again to fully grasp the meaning and innuendo of.what she says.She brings out her characters with tremendous realism. You can almost feel them breathe"
2,Could not find a way to mount it to my truck rack,"Cool concept on this tie down system but I couldn't find any way to mount it to my rack. I don't think it's the tie down, more just the rack on my truck. Make sure it will work with what you have before buying."
5,Truly a must have!,"Truly, as the title says... a must have for music fans! A good mix of english contemporary and traditional hawaiian (and slack key guitar stuff too). They've made my top 5 cds of all time.check them out."
5,From smooth to upbeat! This CD has it all!,"I've had this for 3 days now and I listen to it every night! This CD is one of those rare albums where all the songs are beautiful! You can feel the passion in each song - whether it's the power of the instrumental ""Love..."" that will make you reminisce a lifetime of emotions, or the celebration of life in ""Tropical Island Day"". Hoping for a second CD to come out!"
4,A Financial Self Help Book Just for Women,"My view of this book is somewhat subjective as I grew up next door to Joan in Decatur, Illinois. But, she truly has written a one of a kind book. I've never bought a financial book this easy to read. Passed it to my very un-financial sister and she was able to read it! Remarkable. Fun anecdotes mixed with useful, and accurate, investment suggestions in a very readable style."
5,Any working girl needs to read this book!,I was pleasantly surprised to read this book as if it were a mystery novel. I loved following the financial lives of the working and non working women she presents in her book so brilliantly. I actually read over 100 pages at my daughters volleyball practice and was able to enjoy it despite the noise surrounding me. I had and have many ongoing questions of our families finances and our future. I wish I had read this book when I was working in a higher paying job and jet setting around for a company with an apartment on the Marina Green in San Francisco! Joan thank you for this great book and I highly recommend it to any girl that needs cash! And let's face we all do.
4,Econ Class,"For my economics class, I had to chose and read a book involving some form of economics. I read ""A Girl Needs Cash"" and was pleasantly surprised because I found the book to be very interesting. I enjoyed how the author was able to turn the book into an acutal story instead of just writng facts about enconomics like an encyclopedia would. Not only did the author show us the lives of other people and how their financial lives were going, but she also put herself and her experiences in the book which made it much more interesting to know that even people like her at one point stuggled with money. My favorite part of the book was the section on ""The White Knight Myth"". The ""Money Machine"" was also a very helpful tip. This book contained some very good advice and was motivating. I do belive that this book will help me with my own financial life."
2,better to season yourself,"the finish on this pan is very rough, like sandpaper . i do not like it for that reason . the plus is it's sq size . this is a size that is better for 2 people many pans are for larger size families . i would not reccomend this witout feeling it in perso in a store ."
5,Great product - smaller than anticipated!,"What can I say! It an original, made in France, Le Creuset. The quality speaks for itself. I also was lucky to 'grab' it when it was on a 'lightning deal'. I only wish the oven were a little bigger. I own a larger size Le Creuset (it might be a 5 1/2 Qt size) and very happy with it. I guess I will be using this one for smaller vegetable or meat dishes."
5,Love Le Creuset,"I just love anything made by Le Creuset, and wish I could afford to buy their entire product line!This little oval oven arrived in great condition, and has been used several times already."
3,Tight fitting lid??,"Purchased this through Amazon. At first, very excited. Baked a nice macaroni and cheese in it the first day. When going to put leftovers into fridge, it seemed to me that the lid was not as tight fitting as it could be. If you press on one side you can see and hear it go down ever so slightly and the same on other side (by handles). Is this the way the lid should fit, almost with a slight venting on the sides or is this lid warped? Can anyone with knowledge on these please shed some light?"
1,Not even the correct connected,The end that is supposed to plug into the player to charge is not the correct type. It actually fits into the port on my iPod but not my vission m. Of course my iPod won't take a charge from it though.I am really frustrated.
3,Good if you already have an idea.,"I think that 3 stars is a good review for this book. I give it three stars, but for the opposite reasons Mr. Gindi gave. I found extremely LITTLE explanations in the book. Actually there are minimal written words. Personally, I would like more of a written explanation to better understand what the author is thinking. Instead, the author keeps adding on without explanation, leaving it up to the reader and the CD. If this book didn't come with a CD to hear the examples, it would be a complete waste of money. For me, there are plenty of playing examples in the book. Working with a metronome at different tempos is all I needed. Additionally, the author recommends using scales once the rhythms are better understood. I would recommend this book to anyone who has already mastered basic rhythms meaning everything up to triplets and 16th notes of all sorts, especially since these are the rhythms the book starts off with."
3,Not Swedish and Not Metal,"I have no clue what the other reviewers were listening to or looking at. This actually is a pair of Latina identical twins named Kira and Noma [?] singing some danceable pop which is heavily influenced by La Isla Bonita-period Madonna. Caiman Records, which was probably a tax dodge, doesn't have any web presence and has probably folded, which explains why I picked this out of a cut-out bin for fifty cents. Not great, not bad, bouncy dance-pop. But definitely NOT, as the other reviewer states, a Swedish duo or thrash metal."
2,not sure about this one ...,"not sure about this one ... nasers construct of ""likability"" glosses over many important issues and is highly incomplete. he writes: ""the evaluative image represents a psychological construct that involves subjective assessments of feelings about the environment. this suggests that the evaluative image contains two kinds of variables: visual aspects of city form and human evaluative responses.""really? visual variables are the only ones that determine how we feel about an environment? what about sounds? what about climate and temperature? the sub-categories of ""likeable"" urban features are also highly stereotypical - ""naturalness"", ""historical significance"".I agree with the main point, though. in the age of hyperlocal media, the approach to study the urban environment by analyzing emotional responses does have relevance. however, this book does not offer a lot of insight in this respect, and seems a bit dated in its methods."
5,The Best Book,"Yesterday's Child is my favorite book. I never really enjoyed reading that much, but after reading this book I've been enjoying reading much more. Sonia Levitin is a great writer. She kept my interests during the whole book. She also ended the story nicely. I didn't have any unanswered questions at the end. Holes used to be my favorite book, but not anymore. I would definitely recommend Yesterday's Child."
3,Very compelling novel.,"This was a very good book. I enjoied reading it because it was something that I can relate to. At the end of each chapter, you always want to keep reading so you can never put it down. Books try to trigger at that but they never really achieve it. I suggest you to read it."
4,Solid,"Solid construction easy to use. I was looking for a stapler that was dependable and it seems I have found one that will last for years.Goodluck,Matthew"
1,When something old is discardable,"I am sorry to say that this book on Rashi, by the eminent Maurice Liber is simply to dated, both in its written style, and with a lack of information on Rashi's Milieu."
2,Incomplete Effort,"The performers in this opera are excellent, as well as the orchestra. The problem lies in the fact that the ""recitativi"" are missing. As a result, you are not actually listening to the opera, but rather a series of highlights from the opera. It is very difficult to follow the opera as it develops, since the recitativi provide the opportunity to develop the plot line.If you are interested in hearing highlights from this opera, then you will be pleased with this CD and booklet. However, if you would like to listen to the complete opera as composed by Mozart, please look elsewhere."
5,Sorry it ended,"I judge a good read based on how much I miss the characters after I'm finished. I just finished THE GATES OF THE ALAMO and for the past couple of days, I've been struck by how much I miss having them all around me. An excellent historical novel, made more personal by a recent trip to San Antonio. I only wish I had read this before I visited. Wonderfully rich."
5,well done!,"One of the most compelling (sorry I can't come up with a better word) historical novels I've had the good fortune to read. Can't comprehend a low rating. Descriptions of the fighting at the fort are heartrending and believably realistic. Again, well done! to Mr. Harrigan."
4,The Feeling Of Being There,"I really like this book. Unlike most historical novels, this book doesn't waste time on recounting all the details of a major historical event. Instead of impressing the readers with his vast knowledge of Texas history, Mr. Harrigan places us back in time with no guide.We see the Texas Revolution as ordinary citizens saw it; without the benefit of TV news or telephones. We hear rumors and see the aftermath of battles. In the Alamo, we see only that which is before our eyes, oblivious to what's going on just ten feet away. That is how the citizens of Tejas saw things. That is REAL history.If you want facts about the Texas Revolution, then go buy a history book. If you want a time machine to transport you to the Battle of The Alamo, the you must buy this book."
5,Move over Larry McMurtry....,"Stephen Harrigan expertly captures a time in history that fascinates to this day. The bonus is the point of view of the Mexican attackers of the shrine. The blend of history and fiction is seamless. A great read, start thinking about the casting for the movie......."
5,Remember the Alamo!,"Ranks way up there with ""Gates of Fire"" and ""The Triumph and the Glory"" at the summit of recently released historical fiction novels. In fact it is the best of the three. ""The Gates of the Alamo"" brings history to life as only the best novels of this fascinating genre can, the characters are vividly drawn, the setting and action portrayed with authenticity, and the valor and heroic nature of the siege at the Alamo brought home to the reader with stunning power. A great book!"
3,Yes and No,"Being a Texan and growing up with many trips to the Alamo, you just know the next reading will get it all just right. Sometimes I thought the author was getting it ""all just right"" and sometimes I just got bored. I think I may have set my expectations too high for no other reason than this is a part of our history that equals no other. The Alamo is the most traveled to tourist spot in Texas. I bought this book in the Alamo gift shop on my 3rd trip to San Antonio in five years. If you like to read novels based on history, you will probably enjoy. It did not keep me turning pages late in the night. I think it was a little over sold."
3,A missed opportunity,"When I first saw this book on the shelves, I picked it up immediately. As I read it, I realized what a missed opportunity it was. Unlike The Killer Angels which tells the story of Gettysburg through the principal characters which participated in that fateful event, Gates of the Alamo instead follows three fictional characters who play out a cheesy and underdeveloped drama. Had Harrigan just allowed the readers to go through the story with Travis, Crockett and others, it would have been so much more effective when these men meet their fates at the alamo. To its credit, Harrigan spares no details when it comes to the battle scene in the end. He depicts it with gruesome and minute detail.An overall good read but it loses a few stars because of wooden dialogue and boring characters. It tries to reach the glorious heights of Killer Angels but never quite makes it."
3,Pointless but well written,"I don't know what the point of this book was except maybe to humanize the Texans at the Alamo, and the Mexicans who fought them. The author does a very good job of that, and creates scenes very well. But he relies too much on violence to shock you, and it's a lot like a spaghetti Western---sure, we know people bleed and die, but must our noses be rubbed in it every other chapter? Surely Texans MUST have taken some time out to laugh and play and tell jokes, even during the Mexican invasion!At the end of the book I felt empty, as if I'd just done a lot of ditch digging and couldn't find a beer to cool me down! This could never be made into a movie: the main character is not appealling or strong, as main characters go. He doesn't even get to consummate things with his girlfriend!"
4,"Honest, believable, gripping","Harrigan provides a gripping account of this near-mythical battle. His characters have substance, and offer a believable spectrum of opinions on why ""the Alamo"" happened in the first place. The battle itself unfolds in a totally authentic way, quickly taking on a life of its own that in the end hardly meets the aims of any of the participants. Historical fiction at its best."
5,A Moving Experience,"It is rare to read a book that holds one spellbound and really caring for these characters, fictional though they may be. The characterizations are extraordinary and brings to ""Alamo-atics"" a new perspective that is much more real and human than the cold, historical explanations of the battle. We come to know that these were real people caught up in events that were extraordinarily horrific. I couldn't put it down."
3,Gimme Mo' Alamo,A good historical western. It put more of a factual twist to the over-dramatized Alamo story. I didn't like the slave guy I thought he was a complete coward. I've been to the Alamo so it brought out a better memory for me and I feel I've learned more.
3,Predictable,"Frankly, if you are looking for a book that is enjoyable to read and informs you of a particular event or time period, then I would recommend this book. However, I found the storyline in this book to be very formulaic and typical of historical fiction novels, of which I have read several. There is the typical romance that never quite seems to turn out as the focus of the book with little side plots that are also rather predictable. If you are looking for a historical fiction book, I would suggest reading something like Exodus by Leon Uris or Shakespeare, which actually leaves you with something after you have finished the book. However, Mr. Harrigan's facts seem to be very reliable and accurate, and he does give you a feel for the time from both sides of the battle. All things considered, I would suggest taking the time you would have spent reading this book and doing something constructive with it."
1,Shameful..,"Stop the myth and the heroics...A bunch of illegal aliens, rapacious and fighting for their right to have slaves.Stop adorning theft and racism."
1,Why did Texas seek independence from Mexico?,"I will admit that I have not read the book yet. I did read however the customer reviews to see if this book shows a more enlightened version of the battle. A version different from what Hollywood and the Lone Star State will have Americans believe. They did not. Not one review touched on WHY Texas set out to form its own nation. One main reason was that Mexico had OUTLAWED slavery, which was incomprehensible to (white) Texians. I'm sure that the men on both sides fought bravely, but the Anglos fought to OWN slaves. If this fact is not mentioned than this piece of work is more fictional than historical. Thus many people may find it hard to see the Texians as the ""good guys"". This may upset some people, mostly Texans, but look it up. It is the truth. However I will read the book and write an honest and full review. I bet you Texans can't wait!"
