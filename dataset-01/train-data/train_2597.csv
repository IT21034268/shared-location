5,Grand-O-Grams,"Grand-O-Grams provides a beautiful way to keep in touch with grandkids - my daughter gave it to me for Easter and I love it! The book contains perforated postcards that are beautifully illustrated. There are cards for specific holidays and occasions, as well as, just for fun. Designed by Marianne Richmond, this is a unique and beautiful gift for grandparents. There is also a book called ""The Gifts of Being Grand"" that celebrates the gifts of being a grandparent. Again, a beautifully illustrated and thoughtful book. Either/both would be great gifts for mother's day, birthday, etc."
3,"Johnny Max Band - Ride And Roll (Pour Soul Records, 2005)","veteran and respected name of the Ontario Blues scene, presents great mixture of Blues, fiery Rock 'n' Roll, soul and R&B; in most complete work of namesake Johnny Max Band so far, released in 2005 on Pour Soul Records.Hardened in numerous festivals and shows both in Canada and United States, nominated for 2008 Juno Award, Johnny Max Band gives a thrilling feeling (particular attention should be given to title song ""Ride And Roll"", cover of Bukka White's ""Shake 'Em On Down"" featuring amazing slide guitar work of Kevin Higgins and untraditional slow cover of ""Junco Partner""), masterly fashioned and delivered by skillful band.Johnny Max will drive you away.Personnel: Johnny Max - vocals; Kevin Higgins - guitars; Duncan McBain - drums; Uli Bohnet - bass; Martin Aucoin - keyboards; Alec Fraser- backing vocals.pastblues.com"
2,Review the Book apart from your view of Wilber,"How about a review of the book for what it is?This is not much of a novel. Compared to other pieces Wilber has written, it is not much of a book. Wilber still has fascinating ideas all over the place, but fascinating ideas abounding doesn't make a book into a novel. What about plot, conflict, characterization -- the basics of novels?Ezra Pound notes in ABC of Reading: ""One definition of beauty is aptness to purpose. Whether it is a good definition or not, you can readily see that a good deal of BAD criticism has been written by men who assume that an author is trying to do what he is NOT trying to do.""I had to skim the surfaces of this one ... which is uncharacteristic of the way I've read other things Wilber has written --"
2,An honest attempt.,"I love Ken Wilber. His philosophy has pemanently changed the way I see the world for the better. I even agree completely with Wilber's diagnosis of culture in Boomeritis. But I'm sorry--this is a terrible novel. I couldn't even finish it. And I love long novels, like those by Mark Helprin.Wilber's Sex Ecology Spirituality> is one of my favorite books of all time. I recommend that book, A Theory of Everything, the CD-interview Speaking of Everything, or any music by Stuart Davis, instead of Boomeritis."
5,The perfect summer novel for that eco-tourist vacation,"Wilber rides post-modernism like Pecos Bill rides a cyclone. He uses a rattlesnake for a clothesline, and after washin' all the dirty coveralls of stinkin' thinkin' from the past 40 years, he hangs them out to dry. He drains self-inflation from them mean-spirited boomers faster than 'ol Pecos drained the Rio Grande. Then, when the day is done, he unwinds on the porch with his mountain lion, in One Taste with the setting sun.For those that get it, no explanation is necessary. For those that don't, no explanation is possible."
5,A Life Changing Book,"I am indebted to Wilber for writting this. To be frank- and take a risk- as a member of ""Gen X"" it has changed my life and the way I see the world. More than highly recommended."
1,self-indulgent,"This book is a boring, self-indulgent, male-centric waste of time and paper. I am so grateful I borrowed it from the library and didn't spend my hard-earned money on it. Yucko!!!"
1,Never buy a philosophical 'novel'.,"I should've known better, but being such a fan of Wilber I went ahead and bought this book. There is nothing more irritating than a 'novel' which is really a philosophical essay. I made it through this thing, but I regret wasting time and money on it. My conscience told me not to read this book, and I should've listened, but like I said I'm a fan. I've been waiting for the past 8 years for Wilber to write something new and exciting instead of re-hashing and re-publishing old stuff. I hope he hasn't fallen into this hypocritical capitalism-phase forever."
1,No Way Back,"This picture was poorly acted, a poor script and poor directions. I am a big fan of Campbell Scott, but was terribly disappointed with the movie. Although Campbell did a credible job with what he had, the movie was bad."
4,"Significant, THOUGHTFUL Contribution to Simpson Aftermath","This collection of essays is an accessible, thought-provoking work. If you want to get behind the unarticulated true reasons why Americans were so disturbingly fascinated by the Simpson case, the book gives you much to think about. Yes, racism, sexism, distrust of the legal system, etc. is discussed, in many instances brilliantly. I will be using many of the ideas and concepts presented in this book in the work I do with young high school students and Stanford University students grappling with racism, gender issues and homophobia here in privileged, upscale Palo Alto."
3,"Good price, but came with a broken case","I bought this as a gift because of the variety of songs and because the company who made it is selling it for $30, a ridiculous price for a CD. When it arrived, the case was broken in 3 places. It came with another blank case, which was also cracked, and both of the flimsy cases snapped when I tried to take the cover out of the original case and put it in the other one. If you don't mind a crappy CD case or have spare blank CD cases, then you won't have any problems with this product."
5,"""Legends"" ""Do it again""","Got wind of the "" Legends"" C D s found 3 or 4 at different [2 nd hand] stores, so taken by the music put together on the different C D s I wanted to ""Beef up"" my ""legends"" collection!!!""Do it again"" a ""Solid C D ... all good stuff!"
4,Especially tasty,"Long Grain and Wild Rice Pilaf is definitely one of Near East's best carbohydrate dishes, to spice up an evening meal. At Amazon's price for a 12-package carton, moreover, this superb mix (with super saver shipping) would cost at least 30 cents less per box than at our local grocery store. And we do love it.But that's still more than 43 cents per ounce, and a local supermarket now carries a fantastic basmati, wild rice and vegetable medley in 16-ounce packages. The latter costs more than 70% less. Admittedly, Near East's Long Grain & Wild Rice Pilaf tastes better than the basmati and wild rice mix, which does not include any spices.But we can add our own spices. It's hard to argue with the savings. Except for rare occasions, we have switched off Near East to the far less costly brand."
5,Allen Turkey Taker Adjustable Sight,Allen Turkey Taker Sight fits and works perfect on my Remington 870 like it came from the factory. It is the second shotgun I have intalled this particular sight. Thanks for a great product.
1,Zoom recently redigned this card,"I have an older verson of this card and love it. The newer version has the AF after the model number. It does not have the pull out antenna. When I ordered this card, it still had the picture of the older card. When received, it would not work with either of my laptops. After hoours of searching the net and tech support with Zoom, it turns out it is not compatable with the ENE chipset. It is a harware issue with the card itself and not the drivers. Until is is resloved make sure your PCMCIA adapter does not use the ENE card bus controller."
5,No Problems!,"I was reluctant in purchasing this. I've tried various Bluetooth add-ons for my notebook PC, and I've had a lot of trouble particularly with driver compatibility.I replaced a USB ""dongle"" that worked well, but sticks way out (and I've accidently left it at home or at the office, since of course you must remove it when you pack up).But this gadget installed and worked almost without a hitch.Now, only the little ""antenna"" sticks out, about half the width of the CardBus slot and only a quarter-inch long. This is the next-best thing to built-in Bluetooth."
3,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly",The Good: Vista compatible-download the driver from the manufacturerThe Bad: Don't expect much range from this unitThe Ugly: The software (configuration utility) is NOT intuitive. Be ready to spend some time setting up your pairing.
1,Too Buggy to buy,"Strengths: it is bluetooth on a laptop without a fragile USB dongle.Weaknesses: software stack, install process, support, reliability.Summary: software uses a terrible bluetooth stack. reliability is flaky. will work sometime and sometimes will not. You will have to eject and re-connect the card to get it to work again. Install is also very bad. In fact I cannot get it to install on my new laptop at all. Tech support in non-existent; you are on your own. I am a 14 year veteran of PCs, A+, Net+, and several other certs to include a degree in computer switching systems from the AirForce and I still cannot get this thing to install on my IBM laptop. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!"
3,slow and hard to use,"It's what it says it is, just be sure to have a tech savvy person nearby to troubleshoot. I did it by myself, but it took a long time to sync and ports are limited. Ok product for simple use, like hooking up your mouse or headphones, not so much for data transfer."
2,great idea - flaky product,"I bought that card a bit more than a year ago.I love it because it fits *inside* my laptop and does not stick out too much. Also there is no risk of loosing it as with a USB dongle.The problem I have is that it does not always wake up from ""sleep"" mode.I have to manually disable/enable the port and that's frustrating.It worked fine for a year; this problem appeared a few months ago.I reinstalled windows XP but it does not seem to be an OS issue."
4,Bluetooth PC card works better than inboard hardware on Lenovo laptop,"I had nothing but trouble with the built-in Bluetooth capabilities on my Lenovo T61 laptop and opted to buy a PC card to use, instead. I chose the card over the USB version because of its lower profile antenna. Installation was a trouble-free plug and play experience. All my Bluetooth peripheral devices were recognized right away and they've stayed connected."
3,DO NOT PURCHASE USED BATTERY,Why?For the obvious reason...it's horrible as it could possibly be...Well I cant return used battery so Im using it as a urgent backup battery... which doesnt even last more than 10 minutes maximum...
5,Excellent,"Another quality product from a quality company. Never had any problems with this receiver, and haven't ever wanted to do something, or hook something up that couldn't be done."
2,A below average book,"I bought the book and a TI DSK kit because I thought I could self study TMS320 family. But it's impossible for me to learn from this book. My background: I had a DSP class, an assembly Motorola 6800 class and numerical method/C class and found this book was too difficult for me."
5,simplicity at your fingertips,"Beautiful clear photos, simple instructions, easy-to-understand information - a great way to get started!"
1,cheap,"Delivered with one leg broken off from weld, one rubber cap (for non slip) missing from another leg, was to be xmas gift, but no time to replace and return....lesson learned. Don't waste your $."
5,an eye-opening chronology of drug use in the world,"The author, who is also a physician, has now become a historian as well. His lucid and methodical recounting of the history of drugs use in general and cocaine in particular, truly opened my eyes. As a physician, he explains why the drug does what it does and why people use it. As a historian, he documents all his statements of fact with an extensive bibliography. He does not sound like he is on a crusade either for or against drugs, but one can't help come to a conclusion about the current state of affairs in the world's ""war on drugs."" A must-read book for anyone who claims to have an opinion on the issue of drugs in our society."
2,Pens,"Not a fan of how this pen writes. The pen feels comfortable while writing, but just doesn't write to my expectations."
3,Pretty Good pen for the price,Pen has a good feel and writes well...only complaint is a few of them have been coming apart and don't tighten back up well.
5,Love fine point,"I was having trouble finding fine point pens. I found a few expensive ones at Office Max, but I saw a better bargain by getting a dozen through Amazon. Most pens are medium point, but I just prefer fine point. They work great."
5,"Interesting, Readable, and Encompassing","This book addresses almost the entire gamut of Jewish history, ideas, thoughts, issues, and concepts and does it in a most engaging manner. By necessity individual concepts are allowed no more than a few paragraphs. This makes for a quick read. The book seems to be written as a college text. However, even the most knowledgable will feel they have learned something new. The author approaches topics that have been the subject of controversy in an uncritical and even handed manner so that all but the most rigid will be able to at least identify with both sides of an issue. Fot the most part the author does not interject his own opinion. Where he does do this is often in a place where he finds opportunity to bring in fresh thoughts."
4,"Big Help, good buy - could improve",Suitcase is a good font management program wich is very stable under os 9. The newest version takes up 1/2 the memory and deals with more fonts. Font preievew and grouping is exceptionally simple and easy to use. Suitcase allows you to activate fonts on the fly without restart as well as create specific groups for suitcase to activate for respective applications. I personally have about 4000 fonts on my system and wouldn't even try to manage them without help. My only gripe is that the preview window doesn't give information about the font that is being previewed while previewing a whole suitcase or selected fonts or allow you to activate the font from the preview pane. Adding these two features would perfect the program's usability in my opinion.
1,Not informative enough,"I found this book to be trivial and ridiculous. I just did not find it as useful as other ferret books such as Ferrets for Dummies. It is far to cutesy to be taken seriously and is not very well-written. Isn't this the same author that writes for Modern Ferret? Even so, I was disappointed."
4,Excellent Product,"Other reviews on here are wrong! They do not rate the product but instead point at shipping errors with amazon and the failure of the buyer to learn about the specifications of their DVD drives before burning with DVD -R media!These discs work great! I have been using them for 3 years now for clients to save precious memories. I have never had a failed burn.I have always used Sony DVD writers/readers. I have used ACDSee and Nero to write to the disc. But any other application will work.I took off one star because YES they are expensive, but they will last and they do work!"
4,A Young Sammy and Carmen,"A number of years ago I heard their recording of ,""There's A Small Hotel"", recorded in the fifties on Decca. A great rendition of the Rodgers and Hart classic and rarely done as a duet. The album was out of print for decades and has just been reissued.This disc contains two LP's, ""Boy Meets Girl"" and their interpertation of ""Porgy and Bess"". The ""Porgy and Bess"", is a beautiful arranged and performed recording. The, ""Boy Meets Girl"", is spotty. Sammy resorts to a Jerry Lewis voice in some of the numbers, he's having fun, but it doesn't hold up. I love his voice so I'm always happy when he get's down to business. Carmen sounds fantstic all the way through. For my money and well...yours, if you are considering purchasing this CD, the best part are, the ballads at the beginning and all the Gershwin at the end. Still a good buy, considering you couldn't get it until now."
5,Back and Better than Ever,"Just watched the DVD - I Eat Your Skin - and noticed no problems with the audio, no problems at all so I guess this is a new printing? Very happy to find that Elvira has at last decided to capitalize on her fan base and bring her old self back on DVD's - or live feed I guess. Its like coming full circle. I enjoyed her two movies, one released in 1988 and one in 2002 I think, found them both hilarious and filled with top comedic actors. She should certainly do more of these as they become feasible, but in the meantime keep bringing out the trashy ""B"" rated movies from way back when, with many pop-ups and ""commercials"" with E herself - still looking incredible of course. I will never tire of buying them myself - they are a perfect way of passing a solitary week-end or those rainy days you cant get out. She never disappoints! Enjoy!"
3,Lighthearted breezy pop,"Breezy and lighthearted, yes, but creative and interesting enough where it maintains your attention. This is basically mature adult oriented pop, as opposed to glossy candy-coated pop for teens. Just think Laetitia Sadier's vocals/harmonies from Stereolab combined with an updated version of Pet Sounds era Beach Boys. Musically, the best and closest comparison is Tahiti 80 from France, with perhaps the same romping happy-go-lucky vibes of Beulah or The Bees. The sound is soft, subtle and most importantly, fun."
2,pleasant but few solid tracks,"I heard ""Rollerskate"" on my Walkman FM radio while running at the beach and rushed to buy this album. The other tracks proved to be pleasant and at times campy, but there was little compulsion to play the CD repeated times. Most of the songs are on the inspidid side and I could only listen to ""Rollerskate"" so many times. This kind of 1960s nostalgia combined with wistful youthful love is far better created by the band The Cherry Orchard, which I highly recommend."
2,Mush,"You'll need this only if you've ever wondered what Karen Carpenter would sound like singing lyrics as inane as ""before you learn to walk/before you learn to rock/you learn to rollerskate."" Any number of bands do this kind of thing much better; my advice is to seek out Swan Dive's self-titled album or Beulah's The Coast Is Never Clear. Here the lyrics are mush, the melodies never catch hold and the power pop touches seem tacked on to recycled rhythm tracks. Nothing seems to jell, not even the references to the Free Design."
4,Repaint so your Gundam isnt Mustard Colored!,"This is a solid Gundam. Since it has no inner skeleton like some 1/100 scales, the parts fit tight and it can stand strong. Downside is the posability since it doesn't have that inner skeleton. The mustard color is gross, so I took the liberty of spray painting the trees with some cheap gold paint found at any walmart. Now it actually looks legit! If you're looking for something fun to build and paint and cool to display, you can't go wrong with this version of the HyakuShiki!"
5,PERFECT stocking stuffer.,"Okay, there's not many days left until Xmas but let me assure you that this Garfield book makes an excellent last-minute gift. Everyone I know loves Garfield and would be thrilled at getting a book like this.It's rather thick and taller than usual. Plus it's in full color. As long as I can remember I've loved reading Garfield, even when I was a little kid reading the black and white pocket books. So kids will appreciate this too. Trust me.It opens with 'Garfield's code of Nevers', such as 'Never Eat the Mystery Meat. And ends with 'Garfield's Top Ten Suggestions for New Athletic Events, such as 'The Fridge Lift' and 'Eat till you Explode'. Crammed inbetween are hundreds of hilarious comic strips. Plus there is information on the last page on how to join the Garfield fan club. And why not?"
5,"Garfield, Jon, and Odie are still funny!!!!!",Jim Davis is a genius! I cannot beleive that Garfield is still hilarious!! It is still funny after you've read 10 times!!!
4,Somewhat unrefined but worth reading,"The author is obviously highly knowledgeable of Oracle. He is, after all, an Oracle Certified Master, which is the highest level of Oracle certification requiring two days of intensive lab testing. Most people fail to pass.Overall the book is very well written and is full of useful knowledge. I found its chapters on indexes, Oracle Enterprise Manager, and X$ tables as among the best. I found its chapters on query tuning to be poor, failing to even mention transaction isolation levels and different locking.This is not a book for beginners, but for experienced Oracle DBAs who wants to get a better handle on improving Oracle performance.The downside of this book is that it is somewhat sloppily written and put together, almost as if the book was written as a midnight term paper. The information is valuable and of high quality, just that its level or organization and writing could have used 2 more months of refinement and rewriting."
3,A performance guide for Oracle,Good approach about performances and analysis.I regret this book does not include Oracle 10g.
5,Barn Dance is a very fun book to read for kids of all ages.,"My 7 year old daughter loves this book so much she wants me to purchase it. We originally got it frm the library, My 5 year old son loves to here my voice when the Crow says ""Begin! Grab yourself a partner an jump right in""! This is a well writen book that I would highly recommend."
5,Barn Dance review,"Brilliant illustrations. The writing takes you into the story, which is exciting & fun. Get it, you won't be dissapionted!"
3,A creative book for kids,"The book ""Barn Dance"" by Bill Martin Jr. and John Archambault is a cute book for kids. It lets them know that all things arent scary. Like scarecrows, for instance, arent scary their just to keep the crows away. Also if you child was scared of animals, this book might teach them there is nothing to be afraid of. It also is a very catchy book with all the rhymes and pictures. I was very pleased with it."
1,unbelievably poor craftsmanship- can't even play it.,"I expected this game to be shoddy because of previous reviews and because games in general are so cheaply made these days. But seriously? The cards fell out of the slots constantly. We had to stop the game just about every turn. We have similiar card in slot games like Cranium Caribou and have had 0 problems. (They also use the same cheap cardboard as I would expect) but have the good sense to make the cards only slightly smaller than the holders so they don't slide out all the time. Unless you are playing with another adult (hope you aren't) then it is not worth the set up, because the kid will get frustrated before a full game is played. A great idea for a guess who game ruined by such a simple fix."
2,Not as fun as the original,I got this for my kids from Santa because one of my sisters and I used to love to play the original version of the game (with people). They have really went down in quality in the years since. The game was falling apart the first day. If I had spent much on this I would have been really disappointed.
2,"Mark disappoints, After Writing Curious Dog","After reading ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime,"" you can't help but have high expectations for Mark Haddon's next book. In that book, he creates a sympathetic character from page one and you stick with him to the end. In this book, he creates nothing but characters you can't possibly care about. None can garner, nor deserve, your sympathy. And are they believable? Maybe the kids are, and the wife and the marital problems, but George, who wigs out over a small bump and even when told it's a skin condition of minor consequence, continues to consider it cancerous? Not believable, nor funny, nor enjoyable. This book seems to tell the story from five steps away, whereas ""Dog"" kept you right in the skin of Christopher. It also seems like a knock-off of Hornby, where a lot of characters you don't really care about come together to tell you about their dysfunctional lives. It's a big disappointment."
3,An Entertaining Read,"I almost stopped reading the book when George cuts off his imagined cancer (it would make most readers queasy); yet I'm glad I remained loyal to Haddon's book. Both comical and tragic--as are our own lives--this story has the qualities of an enjoyable plot. As with his other novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, A Spot of Bother has quirky, witty, flawed characters. What I love about these characters is their realization of their own imperfections. While some, like George, may try to eradicate these flaws, in the end they embrace them.This novel depicts a family's desires to forgive themselves and to forgive others in order to continue living their lives. The story was entertaining and somewhat philosophical, but I found the vividness of the self-surgery scene unnecessary. Haddon continues his tradition of misunderstood characters, but I prefer The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time."
3,a spot of bothering embarassment,"As so diligently discussed in previous reader reviews, this is some family!I felt that the portrayal of George in particular was 'spot' on by depicting how a (in this case, erroneous) medical diagnosis can send one, over the top.The detracting aspect of the book was the just-too-detailed 'gay' soap-opera betweeen Jamie and Tony.Another Mark - Foley - stupidly, admittingly, has been cited for less overt faggetry."
4,"Different, but still good. Give it a chance","While I really enjoyed ""A Curious Incident..."", I think that Mark Haddon did a great job with this one too. It is a completely different book, written in a completely different manner. I think that it shows us that he can write more than one style of literature.I found myself getting really caught up in the book. Because the chapters are so short, it is really easy to just keep reading. Haddon has each chapter center around a different character, switching from one member of the family to another, sometimes overlapping scenes from varying perspectives.I think it would make a good film."
4,Extremely well written and funny,"When I was asked what this book is about, all I could say was it's about a dysfunctional British family. The daughter is getting married, the father is having a breakdown. So the plot sounds--is--very pedestrian, and there's not much that happens to change that assessment. The interest is entirely in the telling. Haddon has a very dry, deadpan sense of humor, including a postmodern sense of the absurd, which I found consistently entertaining. I don't consider it life-changing, nor do I expect to remember it for years, but it was a great way to spend a few days."
2,3 stars for Haddon's ability to write well - 1 star for the story,"I thought the book was well written, but I simply did not like the characters. I just didn't care for the story. I give him 3 stars for his ability to write well but only 1 for the story.I absolutely loved the Curious Incident so I was quite eager to read this and was disappointed - wouldn't recommend it.I will definitely give the author another chance when his next book comes out because I think there is great potential."
4,Family crises can be sad and hilarious,"Occasionally hilarious tale of family woes for George and Jean and their grown children, Katie and Jamie. Katie is about to marry a solid guy whom she may not really love, Jamie gets dumped by his boyfriend because he is too closed in emotionally to commit, Jean is having a middle-aged affair with a former colleague of her husband, and George may just be losing his mind. George contemplates a scaly patch of skin and quickly decides it must be cancer; this discovery starts a series of panic attacks despite doctor visits, and he starts to spiral out of reality. The panic attacks, and the nearly constant fear George experiences, with the resulting sense of disassociation, are unnervingly palpable while still being bizarrely funny. The book's near disasters culminate on Katie's wedding day, with refreshing and yet honest outcomes for all."
4,A spot of bother by Mark Haddon,"I was a little hesitant with the idea of reading the rest of the book after reading the first few pages, because I found the start of the book a little depressing what with 61 year old George finding a lesion on his hip and thinking it was cancer but curiousity won out and Haddon's writing won me over. Haddon has a comic sense that allows us to laugh at certain things while at the same time allowing us to look into the complexities of the relationships in the George's family that indirect communication only makes more complex. A book that should not be put aside until read from cover to cover."
3,An unfair comparison,"Is it unfair to compare spot of bother with curious incident? - yeah, it probably is.And that can be the difficulty in reading multiple books by the one author, especially when you have enjoyed the first one so much.Other reviewers have set out the plot and characters, so i won't reproduce that here - but overall, while i found the characters well observed, it all came across as a bit contived - the happily ever after ending and rah, rah, rah.I can see it being made into an on the buses film, and probably doing quite well at it too with Jude Law playing Jamie."
1,bodily functions palooza,"wow, what a horrible book. It seems to be a chronicle of people peeing, pooping, vomiting, and bleeding, with a little bit of plot in between. oh and the people are mostly unlikable - the only likable, decent one was the guy the snotty family didn't want their awful daughter to marry. partway through I started just skimming through the pages and then I flipped to the end but I barely cared enough to do that. gross, disgusting, and full of cute little anecdotes about each person - yuk. it was like the author was a scatalogical five year old. read ANYTHING else."
1,"Dull, Dull, Dull","I couldn't get even halfway thru this book. The characters had barely any life to them and I didn't care, or care to read, about any of them. I haven't read ""The Curious Incident..."" also by this author, but I don't think I want to after attemping this boring book."
2,If you're a real reader skip this one!,"I enjoyed this novel for about thirty pages, and then I felt I'd been trapped inside an Anne Tyler novel gone dreadfully wrong. It's not terrible, but it's basically politically correct, high quality chick-lit. It's well-intentioned, but the epiphanies are contrived and appear like clockwork, and it's simply boring and absolutely predictable. If you enjoy complex fiction this book will annoy you."
2,A Whole Glob of Bother ... not just a spot!,"If you've read my reviews of other books you'll know that I look at a book from several angles. The main view is entertainment. Was this book entertaining? This one is not. Another view is: Do I care to read more, am I drawn to find out what transpires? In other words, was I intrigued? I was not at all intrigued by this work. There are a few cool sentences but nothing worth the price of the book or the time it takes to read it. There were several places that could have been built up and made tense but they were approached in a nonchalant manner. Throughout the whole book the one character loses his mind. You'll lose your mind trying to finish this. I hope you save the receipt for this one."
3,Decent read,"Odd story, dealing with a family's forced fantastic journey from internal fixation to having to cope with external realities. I thought it was worth the read, though topics such as statutory rape were glossed over."
1,Farce gone bad,"Rather than being engaging farce, which Haddon's seems to want it to be, this novel becomes tedious, cliched, sentimental, and mired in details that the reader really doesn't care about (is the wedding on or off: after a while we really don't care). The novel might work well as a play at a local community theater, with lots of gaffaws at the over-the-top and predictable turn of events, sending everyone home with the smug satisfaction of ""all worked out in the end."" Of course the gruesome self-mutilations would have to be curtailed a bit on stage.I was really disappointed after reading some glowing reviews. But with characters that we come not to care about very much, the novel quickly becomes a bore; one can skim through much of it and still ""get it,"" which reflects the paucity of good writing."
1,Don't spend money on this book,"To put it simply . . . much bother about nothing. If you must read this book, borrow it from the library - don't waste your cash."
2,What Happened to the Old Mark Haddon?,"""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime"" didn't just make it on my list of best books of 2005; it made it on my top-ten list of all time. That's why I was so excited to get my hands on ""A Spot of Bother"" by the same author. Unfortunately, this book didn't come near the interest level or originality of its predecessor.This book reminded me of a blend of Jonathan Franzen (""The Corrections"") and Nick Hornsby (""How to Be Good""), neither of which I enjoyed much. I found ""Bother"" to be deathly slow and the characters to be frankly uninteresting. I kept hoping one of them would die, just to liven things up, paradoxically speaking.Though I hate to admit it, I quit reading after 150 pages."
2,Couldn't be Bothered,"It didn't take many pages to stop wasting my time on this book. Supposedly lighthearted and funny, for me the writing style was just plain irritating. I should have known by the subject matter but I had high hopes after reading some reviews. Not for me."
3,very average,"I read and LOVED The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime... unfortunately I did not feel the same about this book.I found the characters somewhat annoying and particularly the father character who was losing his mind, these chapters also seemed to be the longest.Anyway I dont highly recommend this book."
3,Mixed Feelings,"Haddon's first book is on my favorite ""Top 10"", so had high expectations. They were not met. Although glad I read this book, I'm not sure I would recommend it. His writing is brilliant, but the story was slow, and there was no suspense whatsoever to propel the story along. At several points I had to decide whether to keep reading or give up.I would NOT recommend this book for teens."
2,How Do You Root For Loathsome Characters?,"Oh how I wanted to like this book. It was not to be. I gave it two stars as a nod to the occasional chuckle.Why so glum? All but the ancillary character (to husband to be) is a complete and utter small-minded turd on toast. As they would say - prats. Who could like any of them? Jamie redeems himself somewhat, but his underlying character is... lacking. How could the author even make the innocent child bothersome?If all is awry and lives are begging for reconciliation do you make the characters thoroughly vacant, bankrupt, unlikeable jerks who have to think out normal human emotion because they are incapable of it naturally? The husband-to-be had it right - George is the most sane in that house.What a waste of time."
3,Non-sympathetic characters,"I was prepared to love this novel since I enjoyed ""....The Dog in the Night"" very much. But I just couldn't become interested in the characters in ""Spot of Bother."" Didn't even finish reading it."
2,Quite the disappointment.,"Quite a disappointment. I couldn't wait to get my hands on Haddon's new book...o.k., maybe I was expecting too much. But as I tried my best to be impartial, bottom line is that it's just a boring piece of work.I'm amazed at the reviews that say ""laugh out loud funny""...maybe these readers should get out a little more...I do agree that his writing style is unique, and still very good (the reason for 2 stars instead of one)...but as far as plot...monotonous and boring.The ""Curious Incident..."" is a must read, but I got the feeling that this book was a hurried follow-up to get something out there, and ride on the coat tails of ""Curious Incident's"" successes."
2,Who cares about the Halls?,"I was annoyed reading this book about the most unlikeable people, except for the prospective groom. I was totally unsympathetic to this shallow and totally unlovable family. Not funny, just pathetic. I liked The Curious Incident....and was very disappointed with this book."
3,Corrections - Lite!,"If you loved Jonathan Franzen's Corrections, you like this story but find it lite. If you hated the Corrections because of all the miserable characters, then you might mightnot like this one, but just a little bit less. I loved the ""Curious"" book and was disappoimted in this. The characters were normal, and uninteresting."
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"I waited with great anticipation for Haddon's 2nd book, and it definitely fell short. It took me about 130 pages before I finally felt like I had the rhythm of the book and could actually laugh at the characters, but overall, it was not nearly what I had hoped for. Personally, it was a waste of time."
3,A Novel in the Tradition of British Farce,"Haddon's latest novel portrays a typically mixed-up family--this one is British. I did not have an easy time with the textual flow or very British language until I thought Joe Orton. Although Orton is a playwright, this novel makes some sense to me if viewed in the tradition of British farce. John Lahr wrote of Orton, "" In showing us how we destroy ourselves, Orton's plays are themselves a survival tactic"" (Introduction to Joe Orton: The Complete Plays). This line applies to A Spot of Bother as well."
3,Entertaining,"I loved Curious Incident and this was as well written but the story is not quite as good. It was funny and sad but it did get a bit tiresome. It was a bit like an hysterical soap opera. After awhile I began to wonder, ""did I really care?"" But the characters were pretty true, even if the situations were not. And with short chapters and good writing it's an easy read. Good for airplanes."
2,A Spot of Bother,The book was all over the place. It took me a month to read. Found myself losing interest very quickly. I didn't want to give up on reading it though. I finally was intrigued toward the end. Suprised to see this was on a list of suggestions for good reads.I can say that I read it and mark it off my list.
2,Disappointing,"I am also very disappointed about the errors in the book. It is confusing and fortunately I have followed the Oracle instructor-led course. Maybe an updated errata must be released for people who have had confidence in the logo ""Official Authorized - Oracle Press""."
1,Disappointment,"This book contains many errors, in text and tests. It does not help you in explaining how Oracle functions.The examples used in this book are too simple to be of any help.Without any experience in Oracle, passing the test with this book alone is very unlikely.I would recommend buying a different book! (if available)"
2,Any other review books out there??,This book taught the basics. Weak on advanced queries compared to the exam. Bunch of errors too and the website doesn't help at all.
2,So many mistakes! I am amazed how the author make money!,"Although this book is pretty followed 9i's exam objective, there are too many mistakes! It is a big shame for the author and publisher!"
2,Error Error and Error,this book is full of errors. even the so-called fixes on the book web site contain error. You are going to be very frustrated when reading this book.
3,Helpful book,"This book was definitely a help in preparing for the exam. It contains a lot of errors which will hopefully be corrected for another release. The exam questions, both in the book and on the CD, covered the material well. However, the OCP exam questions were very different and more complex in many cases. It often had 5 or 6 answers to chose from and sometimes required 2 or 3 answers. I passed the exam and give a lot of credit to this book."
2,Did not help me pass the certification test,"I have been writing Oracle SQL for 5 years improving the efficiency of the web application our company maintains and decided to become officialy certified. I bought this book, learned some new terminology and Oracle skills. I aced the practice tests that came with the book. However, the official Oracle exam is much more difficult than the book's practice tests. I ended up buying some of Oracle's official practice tests. Of course, they may be scams as well."
4,Good exam reference,"This is the only book I used to prepare for the OCP 1Z0-007 exam. The Oracle published exam objectives were covered and the sample test questions on CD were good. Other than one or two SQL syntax surprises, I had no problems with the exam. This book may not be adequate if you are unfamiliar with databases, SQL, and programming as there is not alot of instructional material here. Good luck."
2,Good Only with other Book,Book is good But Only if you are also using any other book.Also If you are experienced Oracle user then it is OK to use this Book.I found Book from Sybex corporation much better than this Book.It contains scenario based questions which are new in OCP-9iOracle press should add more scenario based questions and material should be more detailed and real Exam types questions should be present in Book. Book contains only mulitple chioce questions which nowdays do not appear in OCP9i.
2,Not all its cut out to be,"This book will teach you some SQL but does not really prepare you for the text. It does cover the material needed, but it does not give weight to the material that will be covered."
5,OCP Introduction to Oracle9i: SQL Exam Guide,Excelent OCP Introduction to Oracle9i: SQL Exam Guide for good price! I recommend you Book for OCP exams.
3,Good enough to pass exam,"This book is perfect if you just want to pass the exam and have at least some experience with SQL. It covers (at least in part) all of the exam topics. If you want to actually learn SQL, this isn't the book for you. This book lacks depth and information about SQL."
3,Hmmmmm,"I used this book to pass the first 9i exam. It gives a good coverage of the core concepts tested in the exam and does provide enough information to pass (just). The reader does need to keep in mind that there are a large number of errors (many that the online errata does not cover). However, to ensure a good score in the exam I would supplement this book with a more detailed guide (how about the Oracle provided documentation on SQL 1600 pages and sure covers everything possibly covered in the exam if you can stay awake long enough to read it!)"
2,How to make big $$$$ with Oracle Official Authorization,"Jason Couchman must be laughing his head off on his own private island. Slap together a book full of mistakes (scripts that don't work, INCORRECT information, inane opinions,) and get it reviewed by his kindergarten kids. Get a buddy at Oracle to whack ""Officially Authorized Oracle Press"" on it.... then watch the dollars flow in.He didn't even both updating reference to ora81 directories.Shame on you Jason. I thought Nigerian e-mail scams were bad, but this book is just a cruel rip-off of people wanting to get somewhere in life.Shame on you Oracle for giving it your blessing.I may pass the exam but books such as this will not help me become a competent Oracle DBA."
3,Not enough to pass exam,"This book is an update from the release 8i. Looks like the author did not take the time to properly update material, the functions chapter have missing lots of the new functions in 9i, same goes for MERGE and INSERT INTO (SELECT FROM ...) statements.I was surprised some of the new 9i stuff was not even mentioned in the book.Some of the examples are well explained, but there are some errors, you better test them and not take them as granted.You can use this book with Sybex Introduction to Oracle 9i, both will be enough to pass exam."
1,Not a good book.,"This book contains too many errors, in text and tests. It does not help you in explaining how Oracle functions.This book contains too many errors.It is well organized but only few Oracle 9i new features are related in this book, not all. And during the OCP exam you will have some questions about the 9i commands that are not here.Then you need to find another way to learn Oracle 9i SQL.Without any experience in Oracle, passing the test with this book alone is very unlikely. Even with a good experience you need another books or documentations to help you."
2,Has many errors and doesn't cover iSql*Plus !,"The book is plentiful in erros, to an extent that eventually you feel you need to try every stated fact to be absolutely sure it isn't an error. Book also does not cover iSql*Plus, an area tested in 1Z0-007. Apart from these lapses, I did manage to pass the exam well by using the book."
1,Recipe for Failure on the Oracle9i Exam: Introduction to SQL,"If any one relied on this book, which says it is an exam guide, and took the exam, there is a very good chance that he or she will fail. I tried to contact oracle press regarding the abyssmal content of the book, because a bunch of my Oracle 9i students complained about the book and a few of them failed the Oracle 9i: Introduction to SQL exam depending entirely on this book. People at oracle press are probably flooded with such complaints and that is why they are not getting back to complaining customers. If some one wants to use this book, all I can say is GOOD LUCK!!!"
5,How an idealist comes to commit suicide,"Further Adventures is ugly, disturbing, depressing, horribly written, and, most importantly, undeniably brilliant. The writing style is perfectly and purposely bad. At first it's a hinderance, but it grows to expand the experience. It's a real credit to the content that he could use such a purposely bad writing style and keep me engrossed almost from start to finish.As was said before, there is a chunk near the middle where it slows to a crawl with tangents, confusion, and story that doesn't seem to add anything at the time. However, even this, just like the writing style, creates the overall picture that is Ray Green's life."
5,Good but costly!!!,"Love, love, love this series for my children!!! I am a homeschooling mom with a child that needs repetitive work, in order to remember. These books give many pages of writing the words, in puzzles and sentences. It has helped him remember his spelling words immensely. However, I will not be able to purchase the 4th grader edition due to the cost. I am not sure why the sellers are trying to sell for such high prices."
5,Good review and good teaching,"Well my son hates learning, but this book has made keeping him on track a great help. I would buy again."
2,Not for Christian Homeschoolers,"I bought this as a fun vocab activity book, which it is, with the exception of using activities such as page 67's ""Crystal Ball"" and other horoscope and wizard activities. If I had known this would be in the book, I would have bought something else. Our children have enough evil influences without having it in their textbooks. Call me old-fashioned, call me a religious fanatic, but I will not submit my children to the occult."
1,High expectations dashed,After searching for a more unusual scent I found this most intriguing reference to a perfume that was recreated from a reputable old company. I was hope for the elite of days gone by but what was in the bottle was no more than a scent that would repel insects. I was highly disappointed. If you want a classic you will have to pay for it. I will stick to the more expensive higher quality name brands and never stray again.
3,Mentions Merles!,"This book was first published in the mid to late sixties, I found the date of 1967 on one website. In the place where it talks about coat color inhertance it states that merling is dominant to black and tan and parti marked, proving that this author has seen the pattern for almost 40 years in the breed.Otherwise this is a very small book, but for under $1 it is worth adding to any chihuahua collection."
2,Not well made!,"Really just bought this costume for the mask for my 8 year old son. Jacket runs very small! I bought medium, which should be an 8/10, but this didn't even cover his wrists. Or cover the top of his pants. Jacket closes from the back and has three very flimsy pieces of Velcro that keep it closed.....or not closed in my case. Lots of doctoring to see if I could get the outfit to work on him....in the end just used the mask."
5,"Michelangelo's ""David"" Statue","I received the Michelangelo's ""David"" Statue,in what I would consider a reasonable time frame and it was well packaged to avoid damage in transit. The statue was everything that I expected it to be. Well made! I give the quality of the sculpture 5 stars.Joe C."
4,All good,Just what I was looking for at a very reasonable price. Very good quality material with fine detail. Arrived safely in good protective packaging in the reasonable time of a full three weeks from US to OZ.
4,Carnation,Granddaughter wanted a pink cat and Carnation fit the bill. Easy and excellent ordering. Will use this site again.
4,"Very good intro to C, especially for the research oriented","I was quite impressed by this book. I had a little knowledge of C before using it (came from a COBOL and VB background), and to be fair it was the text used for a 1-week course in C, so I didn't really learn my C from it, but it was a very good accompaniment to the lectures.As an applications developer, mostly with business info systems, the examples were not quite right for me. They were oriented towards the researchers and mathematicians out there, but the title happens to mention that doesn't it. That minor gripe aside, the book contains a lot of general C information to an intermediate/advanced level.Well recommended for people cross-training from other structured languages and those learning to program for the first time. It is also a handy reference for those less experienced C programmers like me."
3,"Nice, but far from best,.","I purchased this a few days ago to go on a long road trip with some other buddies all driving cars, and I would have to say the set up is nice. The only downfall to the system is it seems a little too cheap for 500$. The radar pickup is not as quick as some of the escort models, and it has quite a few false alerts. I would say if your looking to buy one, good choice - you will be happy over all, but wait until it drops in price a bit."
4,Slow Shipping Frustrates Reviewing Process,"Wish I had more time to review this item but after waiting 10 days longer than the delivery estimate, I am still evaluating this device. If you need the item in a timely manner, do not use the free shipping option. Wanted to mention my progress and experiences before Amazon locks out my option to review."
5,Awesome live band,"This is Sodom in their element, pure thrash done to perfection LIVE. This is a fine tight band. \m/"
4,Great album,"This is a very good album. They sound really good live. The inner artwork is a bit [...], so I guess that's why it's not the cover art. This live album includes a drum solo, a guitar solo, and bits and pieces of extra filler music such as an ""introduction"" to Blasphemer. Most of the songs on this sound better than the originals, such as My Atonement for example."
4,Shared Experience,"Easy to listen to...yet danceable. I put the CD player on ""random"" and listened to it again. The original lyrics seem so straightforward that I imagine I am reading her personal mail. She shoots from the hip and her heartache is a listeners' joy. On the other hand, I feel like she is writing about me. I once had a love...Anny's glib music gives listeners counsel on the shared experience of wrong timing and how it feels to be on the losing end of love."
3,this book could save your life when a tornadoes striks,this tells you what kind of damage and death tornadoes can cause. the people that can read this book is just about anyone. a tornadoes is a vortex that is a bunch of wind and clouds that can go about 300 mph and it can also throw things up to a mile far. yes you should read this book because you will know what to do and not what to do.kenny d.
2,Fireworks,"We have about 10 of these in our office for each of the desktops. It might be a life (Used for 3 years) thing but 2 of these randomly started smoking with sparks. I'm going to replace them for safety reasons, worked well up until now but these incidences have permanently nick-named these ""firework boxes"" which is not good. The worked well but they shouldn't end in a bang."
3,A Shaw Bros. Classic!,"That's right! This movie is a Shaw hit! Stars Whang Jang Lee, Leung Ka Yan (Beardie) & Pia Piao. This is 1 of 3 movies that Jang Lee made @ the Shaw Studios, that I am aware of. The other 2 being, Ghosts Galore & the kick fest Kid From Kwangtung.This is a good movie despite its 2 flaws, IMHO. Jang Lee does not show off his legs enough. And it contains magic.This version is LBX & the quality has been cleaned up quite a bit. The subtitles are legible."
4,Martial arts Black magic mayhem!,"Hwang Jang Lee is once again amazing in a dark story involving, mis lead killers, and a hate driven Martial arts master, who dalves into to world of chinese black magic. Amazing fights, creative story, and a great cast. A definite must see."
4,Worth the effort,"I'm a huge fan of vampire fiction and movies and found this book listed on some websites. When I sat down to read it, I discovered it was a reprint of one of the first serious books on vampirism, so the style and type is old fashioned. Still, it's definitely worth the read. After all, vampires are the most fascinating of all creatures in folklore. I think that it is a very good book for first time vampire readers, and will help dispel the misconception that vampires are all from Central Europe. It was cool to read about British fiends and Persian ghouls."
4,Claus Porto Soap,"Luxureously creamy and wonderfully fragrant. Well worth the price.First of all, my one order was split into two spearate orders. I was shocked at having to pay an exhorbatant shipping fee on not one but two orders. When your order arrived, I was also, charged another 21.65CDN for customs fees. Whatever happened to free trade? As much as I loved the soap, the shipping killed me. Amazon made it virtually impossible to communicate with them regarding the issue, thus no communication even when I sent message cancelling my order.Dina de Wit"
5,Very in-depth and easy to follow information.,I have learned quite a bit about the art of Isshinryu Karate by reading this book. The first section concerning the origins and techniques was very informative.
4,very stylish,"i usualy never have to try on shoes before i buy them, but i wish i had with these. until you can really break then in , i suggest a half size with these shoes, otherwise the elastic in the back is painful. other than that, they are super cute. i wear them all the time now that they are worn in."
4,"Cluck,Cluck,Cluck,Baawkk...Bawk....Bawk......Baawk!!!!!","Low budget horror about a killer that acts like a chicken and gets paroled even though he acts like a chicken!Sounds about right!I probally would have only given 3 stars,but this dvd from troma is packed with hours of extras.I can't say I have ever seen a horror movie with a killer of this sort(Props for the originality).Yeah... it's moronic ,but that just makes it funny as hell.When you see this guy going around making chicken noises it's hard not to laugh.I gather that is the effect they were going for and it works on that level.The gore effects are done well and the acting as good as can be for a z-grade movie.A great pick up for the cult classic lover."
3,Luther the Geek,"{DVD director's cut.} Well, a poor movie at best. Typical ""victims"" that are useless. My 70 year old mother would have wasted Luther right off the bat. Even an armed cop couldn't handle the freek. The only reason for getting this movie is Stacy Haiduk's nude scenes. I was hoping that the shower scene outakes would have shown more. Stacy is entwined with her co-star and we don't get to see her by herself.Fred Olen Ray needs to teach the director how to shoot a shower scene. If he shot it, we would have seen her strip for the camera, shower with ""no curtain"", ""then"" the guy would have shown up. Also, the outakes are very grainy. Why is the movie clear and outakes grainy? I was hoping for the lovemaking scene in the bed to have outakes too, but they didn't add them. The other extra's are lame."
2,skip it,"wow what can i say, it's not scary, has little gore and other than stacy looking amazing it wasn't worth the time."
3,Not so great,"This book reads like it was written in a hurry, and I didn't think the author was even a lawyer until I looked up some information online. There is nothing great about this book, though it may be helpful to those who want to learn a little about how religion has been treated by the courts."
5,doug and the slugs slugcology 101 rare fun rock,"this group even though canadian was very popular where ever it went. this cd is a prime example of good fun music.it is a tradegy that doug bennet lead singer passed away, and now the music is getting hard to come by. this cd contains all there hits and a few other classics i highly recommend this cd if you ever saw there videos and laughed you will enjoy this cd just as much. we own it amd love it."
4,a Big pleasure,I bought this because I heard Bruce Adolphe's Piano Puzzlers on NPRs Performance Today. I am pleased I bought it. I enjoy listening to it. I look forward to more of his music. I think you can enjoy this especially if you still carry the magic of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf.
3,Movie was good and worth watching but acting could have been better,"Beauty story about love. However, what was more important was all their love came together by putting God first. Acting was not as strong."
2,disappointed,Really looked forward to watching this movie..and seeing Anthony Tyler Quinn..but the movie failed to deliver. It seemed like Quinn struggled througout the whole movie...and it didn't go anywhere. Quinn's character just seemed stuck..unable to make a committment to God or his wife other than saying he would never let her get away again-until the very end when he says he wants what his wife has. too little too late
5,Love this movie!!,"This was indeed a Great movie!!! For Couples and Families to watch!!! It's fun, and some parts will make you cry, because the father was taking care of his son and the father and mother re-connect after years of her disappearing... Inspirational and Uplifting.."
2,Disappointing,"So disappointing! I found the plot confusing, quinn's character lacked depth, and Christianity misrepresented.It had the potential to be so interesting and influential. Badly done."
4,Better than expected,"What a pleasant surprise to watch a Christian movie that is remarkably well done on a very limited budget. Strengths: the parts of Jeff and Heather are quite well acted; the plot is straightforward yet interesting and involving, and the ending, like real life, leaves some important things unresolved. This points us back to what we saw and heard in the film.Weaknesses: (1) the overly positive picture of some of the church folk as people who seem to have it all together, and (2) the eerie feeling that the boy was often thinking and speaking like an adult.It would serve well --perhaps too well-- as a basis for discussion in a small group, and the qualities which make it easy to discuss may be part of the reason why it is not completely successful as a work of art.It's not one of the great films which draw me back again and again, but it is a fine and thoughtful piece of work, worth watching more than once and recommending to others."
5,There is a message in this movie for all ages!,"Our family just finished watching NO GREATER LOVE. WOW! We have anxiously been awaiting its release and it was even better than we anticipated. It is such a realistic, moving, genuine story of love, faith, loyalty, repentance, forgiveness and transformation. It has provoked a wonderful discussion of many of the minor themes within the movie, as well as the major story line involving Jeff and Heather. This film wonderfully demonstrates that the principles of God's Word are TRUE and broken marriages and broken families can be restored. God IS sovereign! This is the message of HOPE and CHANGE that all America needs to see. I can't wait to pass it around to every family we know, and I encourage everyone else to buy a copy and do the same. I am already looking forward to the producers' next movie - Heartbook!"
4,No Greater Love,"I really loved the movie, but the copy I was sent was damaged in the most important parts of the movie.Otherwise, it would have been an awesome DVD."
2,A great movie ruined,"A movie that was well thought and filmed is ruined by a strange section about marriage, divorce and remarriage that made an unbeliever know more about grace than Jesus. ""No, you can't remarry your unfaithful wife that you have forgiven because... you are an unbeliever!""Really? What is the biblical base for this? Who said they are not still married in God's eyes (both are still single so there is no controversy-you can see Mathew 7 and 1 Cor. 7).I would gladly recommend the movie to all if you delete this segment (while watching I was looking forward to recommend it to all my friends and use it in ministry)."
2,Message is great; movie is hokey,"The acting is mediocre; storyline isn't very believable. A mother might walk away from her kids at one point, but having gotten herself straightened out, she seemed to do little to try to find them again. This casts a shadow over everything, in my opinion. I was eager for the whole thing to be over. It was a decent effort on the producers' part to get that message out there, but ended up being so hokey. Don't waste your money!"
5,Ruff as hell,This is one of the best cds i've heard in a long time. Lenny Dee and Dj Demigod rock the hardcore scene. If you like distorted bass and cool samples this cd is for you. P.S. More wu-tang mixes!!!
3,Ruff Beats in Effect.........ive,"'One Step Back' is a great CD if you are into the Rotterdam Gabber (not much faster than 160BPM). I personally prefer artists like Delta 9, whose tracks are 200BPM plus! If that is the kind of gabber you are looking for, then this album will be a disappointment - Otherwise, if you enjoy lots of monotonous & chaotic noise, then this CD is for you ;)"
4,How to Draw Disney's Tarzan,I was delighted to get this book for a project we are working on for my first grandchild's room. Was so happy to get it in great condition and so inexpensively!
4,Drawing for the unartistic,"I have maximum enthusiasm and minimal artistic abilities. I stripped a small wooden dresser and began repainting it for the nursery. Using this book, a pencil with a good eraser, and a lot of sunlight and patience, I created a remarkable young Tarzan and his ape mom! I was so impressed with myself, I sat back and stared at it for a long time. I've been drawing misfigured and misproportioned Disney characters for my neices and nephews for a long time. Finally, with the help of this book, I was able to make some characters that would be instantly recognizable by anyone, even if they're not entirely forgiving tiny tots!"
1,Do not buy this film,Don't buy this film because it can get you nightmares and can let you have anxiety attacks. Like me.
3,"Insane, bizarre, demented do not describe this freakshow!","BOARDINGHOUSE is a micro-budget shot-on-video horror movie which is arguably the first-ever direct-to-video movie ever produced (and almost definitely the first shot-on-video movie transferred to 35mm and shown in theaters). While at first glance it seems to be nothing more than a cheap piece of schlock shot in someone's backyard, what makes BOARDINGHOUSE stand out amid the hordes of other such movies is the movie's undeniably off-the-wall atmosphere, demented performances and amusingly ameteurish make-up and visual effects. The average viewer will no doubt be completely bewildered, but fans of underground horror and drive-in exploitation will be delighted by this unrelentingly weird little freakshow."
3,B-movie from HELL,"Can't get any more ""B"" than this. There are some disturbing parts in this film. The acting is very similar to an adult movie. I just like the gore represented here. If that's what you're into, you'll appreciate this film. If you're looking for a good plot and reasonable acting. Keep searching."
2,Very poor CD design,"The book is intelligently put together EXCEPT for this enormous and irredeemable flaw: several examples of how to play a given lick or solo are lumped together such that you can't simply put a lick or solo on repeat until you can play it the way you want to. Instead, you have to go through several examples until you can get to the one you want, or you have to stop playing, make several mouse clicks, and even then you can't get to the exact spot you want.No idea why the publisher chose to lay the CD out this way, but it makes an otherwise good lesson book absolutely NOT WORTH BUYING.It's too bad."
4,Useful as an economical training reward,"as a dog trainer, i can go through a lot of treats. i have found the food rolls make good economical treat rewards when cut into small pieces that is a bit healthier for the dogs than hot dog or cheese. i cut the roll into cubes normally, although with the red barn i found it easier to cut rounds and brake off pea-sized chunks. this brand has less moisture than some of the other brands it seems, so it isn't so bad for getting your hands messy. still, i would like to see these made of even better quality ingredients if possible."
5,QUALITY AND FLEXIBILITY,"I've owned five German Shepherds, one Dalmation, and one mixed breed dog over a 15 plus yr. period. The Redbarn product is far superior in quality. Not one dog has disliked the product. The plus is that you don't have to refrigerate the Red Barn roll until it is opened. Also, the portions of food you use from the roll can be adjusted by you in the event your budget is a little tighter at certain times of the month. I put slices of the food on top of a good quality dry dog kibble when I need to stretch my money. I like the variety in sizes of the rolls as well as varied content of each roll. Finally, many sources are embracing this product, and I am glad this site sells it at the most reasonable prices I have seen. LORI, Phila."
4,excellant training from a playerin his prime 40/40,this video will encourage you to grow in the skills needed for todays athelete in the area of baseball from the man who was the first to ever hit 40/40
5,most know of d.l.moody but have u?,While most christians have heard of d.l.moody and Ira sanky not many realize that marcus rai score also accompanied these two gifted servants of God on the evangelistic crusades. It is my sincere prayer that more of His children today would become acqainted with marcus tau sford. The theological doctrine could not be more sound and is presented in a style unique to the author...on par with c.h. Spurgeon and many of the well known Puritans of years gone by.
2,don't believe the reviews,The way some of the reviews are written signals that they are written by the authors themselves. :(
1,Don't bother,"Disappointing. I'd expect much more from a book that is a ""developers guide"". For example, the programs have to be typed in, there is no cd or website! The explanations were too brief and skim over topics. Keep looking if you are in need of a good j2me book."
2,not what it claims to be!,"i'm a big fan of afrobeat and afrofunk - old and new. i've heard a lot of new afrobeat & electronic african music, and this cd has nothing to do with it. AFROTRONIC (and that goes for afrotronic vol. 2 as well) is mostly a collection of of abstract chillout & acid jazz, or should i say ""just another abstract chillout & acid jazz"". the african influence is hardly noticed. if you want some really good electronic afrobeat, buy ""d'afro disco"", and ""abstract afro lounge"" (which is by the way more straight forward than abstract, and more house like than lounge)."
3,Pretty illustrations,"Pretty book? Absolutely.""A Story of the First Christmas?"" Not at all.Most of these illustrationswould make beautiful Christmas cards. But the story is only vaguely related to the actual Christmas story."
5,Great SKA!! Awesome Rhythms! Especially great sax work!!!!,"This is one of the few CD's that I have listened to back to back and liked even better each time I listen! This is truly ""tight"" SKA with great melodic horn lines and super vocals to match. I am a selective jazz fan and found that these musicians were tasteful as well as full of the energy that you would expect from a SKA band. Why aren't these guys on MTV????"
5,A Must Read!,"Not only is this one of the best romances I've ever read, it's one of the only ones that has made me laugh out loud...at least on purpose. Elizabeth Doyle is a real find, and I can't wait to read another one by her."
5,Inspiring,"As an overweight woman, this play truly struck home for me. As an actress, it inspired me to continue on with the themes of this play and to write my own one woman show about obesity for women. Excellent play! Must read."
3,not so much,"I didn't like this play as much as I thought I would. I liked the concept, but it seemed like LaBute struggled to make a whole play out of it. I felt bogged down in repetition and wasted time as the characters uttered one unfinished sentence, one unfinished thought, after another. I spent much of my life as one of ""the fat girls,"" and I kind of wish LaBute had done better by us. That said, however, the play does take on an important but touchy subject with considerable honesty."
4,A bit sentimental for LaBute...until the nihilistic close...,"Is our black-hearted boy growing maudlin in his old age?Of course, there has always been the pretense of the moralist in LaBute, but with the slightly ""I'm OKAY, You're OKAY"" intro. here followed by this exercise in topicality - it seems as if the American Pinter has hit a rut. The only redeeming value is FAT PIG's truly ""no hope"" (and also accurate) denouement, which has to be read to be believed. One can't even imagine it being staged as effectively as the reader's cold-blooded turn of the final page into...nothing. Wow. If only the rest of the text were this bloodlessly dark. Likeable for these reasons, but minor."
5,good product,"bought for my me, it's good book. rest of the words for amazon 20 counts one two three four five six seven eight nine ten"
4,Book needs to be upgraded to 147,The book is fine and covers almost 80% of the topics of OCP 9i as well. So far little upgradation is required to make it effective for 9i exam papers. The book is wonderfully organized even a novice user can start with the book and take a hold.
3,Milton C,"Pros:The book touchs all the topics required for the OCA exam.Cons:Some of the questions in the practise exams in the book need improvement, especially the answers to the questions is vague.Similar is the case with the quesions in the CD accompaning the book.Conclusion: This book with some help from Oracle documentation should get one through the exam. But do not rely on the practise question in the book."
1,Thin Ballistic Nylon - Poor Quality,"I ordered this to replace a tool bag that I bought at a brick and mortar store. This tool bag sounded very similar and with a name like DeWalt, I was confident that it would be quality. Unfortunately, upon receipt of this bag, I was disappointed to see that that nylon material is more like what my gym bag is made of and not like what a tool bag should be made of. The description of ""Heavy Duty"" is very misleading. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this tool bag to anyone. Well, unless you want to use it to pack gym clothes and towels in! It is way too weak. Guess I am just left holding the bag! Don't be foolish and make the same mistake I made by ordering this bag."
2,well...ireally dont know much to talk about this....:),i would recommend this for beginners....just like me....do read this and make utmost use of this book....
1,a word of caution,"I bought this receiver 2 years ago and have been generally very happy with it. Unfortunatly, about 2 weeks ago it started producing a buzz/ distorted playback. I have taken very good care of it so I was quite suprised to have a problem after only 2 years. I tried all kinds of remedies and nothing fixed the problem. The manual and Yamaha tech support were unhelpful as well. Now it looks like I'm back in the market for a receiver when I should have been set for years."
2,Warning!,"I'm not going to damn this receiver, but...1. I was told by someone else that the sound has a hiss in it. It does at higher volume levels, but is very noticeable.2. Someone else told me the sound was a little ""thin."" It is, but has good clarity.3. The right channel went out within a couple of months.4. The manual is good, but the setup between the balancing of the five channels is painful, manual labor.I was attracted by all the features and the cheap price. High current amp? Ha!I was attracted by the name, never having had a Yamaha receiver before. This one's going back to the store and I'm now researching Denon and Onkyo. Higher priced, but I want reliability."
1,bait & switch,"when i received the product it had a sticker on it with a price of $20, i paid $75 something and feel cheated by the sticker being there, it had been on someone's shelf for a time? so if you want me to be happy you may need to lower the price some and guarantee that it won't fall apart in the future. it is not a new part. thank you"
3,Great for the price,"This is the second vehicle I have put this product on. They have both been 25 foot Motorhomes, and they have been preety easy to mount and works well."
5,Have stopped Buying These,"I feed sweet potato treats to my little dog, due to his many food allergies.The sweet potato also provides some fiber to his diet. Lucky for him (& me)that he LOVES sweet potato. I decide to try these with the piece of duck jerkytwisted around the piece of sweet potato. Duck has a fairly low reaction levelto allergy prone animals, as well. What a nice little change for him; & he LOVESthese so much, he gobbles them right up.I have stopped buying these; once I found out they were made in CHINA !! Too manydog deaths from tainted products coming out of that country. My dog is too preciousto me; to even take the chance; NO THANKS !!!"
1,A Real Find,"16 Oz. Sweet Potato & Duck Wraps! My dog is allergic to all grains and, consequently, he is unable to enjoy any of the popular commercial dog treats. For years I made treats for him out of his dry food but it was a messy, smelly process. What a relief for me and a thrill for him to find dog treats he really loves. Thank you Cadet!"
1,Made in China,"This item is made in China. Will not feed my kids food made in china , will not feed my dog food Made In China ! !"
5,Love It!,Our dogs loves these treats! Our lab has allergies and is limited on what she can eat but these treats are great for her!
1,Mislead thinking only 2 ingredients.,I was very disapointed that it states only 2 ingredients and find to my dismay it also contains salt and oils.Mislead or misread of advertisement. Boo to these snacks!
5,Sweet Potato & Duck - How Could You Go Wrong?,"First all 7 dogs love sweet potato treats, you wrap them in chicken or duck and you just improved something that was already perfect ;) This is a winner in my house!! Woof Woof Woof Woof Woof (5 woofs)!"
1,Moldy dog treats.,"Returned because the treats had mold on them. Also the label says that it has ingredients other than sweet potato and duck, unlike the product description on Amazon."
1,DO NOT FEED YOUR DOG THIS PRODUCT !,"The Sweet Potato and Duck Wrap has been specifically named in the latest FDA report as one of the dog treats that is unsafe to give your dog. Please read the latest report yourself. I also recommend a Facebook page ""Animal Parents Against Pet Treats and Food Made in China"" that list the facts on the brands that are considered to be unsafe. The CADET brand is named in the complaint. I have always bought my pet treats from the RAWHIDE DEPOT vendor on AMAZON, and have ordered the CADET brands...unaware that most CADET dog treats were sourced from China. I will continue to order from RAWHIDE DEPOT. I have gotten excellent service with them. However, I will not order the CADET brand of dog treats again."
1,Sweet Potato from China,"I purchased these treats because they were listed at Amazon as ""Made in USA"" dog treats when they actually were from China which is clearly displayed on the container. I will not be purchasing any more dog treats from Amazon, and I question their honesty in promoting these treats as Made in USA."
4,An epic novel,A Woman of Cairo was an incredible read. Dotted the i's and crossed the t's on the gaps in my historical knowledge of Egypt. His research is faultless. What a shame is is no longer with us. Tanamara is still my favoutite though.
1,right picture wrong brush,"thought that i was getting replacement for my old stanley brush,which by the way i've had since i was 6yrs old. I'm 53 yrs youngthis brush has been every where with me to include 21 yrs of militaryservice, when i ordered the pictured one and the one i recieved theywere different, it was shorter and had a fuller logo. Found out fromthe shipper, that stanley and fuller are merging. was a little disappointedbut will keep on looking. but overall the experience was awesome.thanks Hector"
4,Helem,"Brian Whitaker's 'Unspeakable Love' is a great summary of the life of current trends and treatment of homosexuality within contemporary Arab culture. This book should not be read expecting a history of homosexuality within this culture as this is not its intent. The book provides a detailed portayal, especially, of a paradigm shift from the 90's to current day. There are some issues with the book being a bit choppy in its presentation but that does not interefere with the information. Whitaker also provides detailed notation of where to obtain additional resources via the web. In addition, many wonderful Arabic texts are discussed in this book."
4,fun prop,"This item is perfect as I belong to a clown club where we go to nursing homes, hospitals, special events etc. and this parasol just completes my outfit. It's also cute enough to use for table decorations."
1,Broken After only 6 weeks use,"Bought this for my wife for christmas. The little wheel thats sets the time broke off and gone. Two weeks after amazon return policy, boy what a rip-off. I can truly say lesson learned, I will not buy items online anymore. Only will I buy from a store that I can deal with person to person, not this bull---- typing back and forth to try to get something as simple as this resolved."
3,Fun debut CD from a great band.,"Cibo Matto is undoubtedly one of the best new bands of the past decade. They combine pop sensiblities that are both retro and modern, American and foreign for a very unique J-pop-transplanted-to-America sound. Cibo Matto's debut EP is a fun collection of songs that showcases their talent and musical sensibilities.Why did I give this CD only three stars then? This CD had a very limited pressing and has long since been out of print. Four out of the five songs are either the same or alternate versions of songs available elsewhere. The result is that hardcore Cibo Matto fans end up scouring used record stores and/or online venues in order to find this disk, and then are slightly disappointed that the 15 minute-long disk doesn't really contain all that much in terms of new material. The CD requires more effort and more money than it is really worth in order to obtain it. Now if they were to reissue it, that would be a different matter..."
3,cibo matto... food love,"The best reason to buy this is for the GOOD version of 'Beef Jerky' (it doesn't have most of the guitar that the album does) The rest of the songs are fairly solid. Don't forget the cover of the Soundgarden song 'Black Hole Sun', which was disappointing."
5,Life long commitment!,I've used these brushes since I was a teen. No other brush goes thru my thick hair.I just bought my toddler her first one for her thick do!
5,"Unusual, innovative, magical","In a time when most of the new releases in jazz sound eerily similar to most of the other new releases in jazz, EST's Strange Place for Snow is one of the most astonishing jazz records in years. Their unusual and magical compositions, vaguely reminiscent of several musicians cited in previous reviews, also stubbornly sticks to EST's own idea of jazz. Even though it is not American, EST's Strange Palce for Snow takes an important innovative step in the evolution of contemporary jazz music. Its lyrical qualities are more Swedish (not Icelandic) than they probably would like to admit themselves, but that only adds to the surprising combination with atonalities not unlike Monk. Dreamlike, magical, unnerving, and never cheap or sentimental: this is EST's best record so far. Oh, and please: don't turn off the CD player after the last track, but just let it play silence for another half hour. You'll be surprised."
4,The essence of E.S.T.,"This release has all the qualities that make E.S.T. so great: Catchy melodies mixed with interesting sonic soundscapes. They create and build dynamic compositions that range from ambient textures to hard-driving rhythmic beats. This will be in my CD player for some time to come... Surpassed only by ""Seven Days of Falling""."
2,The more the better,The bound book is fine. The quality of the pages are fine. The number of pages is way to little.
1,No good,I used this exactly as the instructions suggested and even gave it extra time to cure and the patch ripped right through the center 5 minutes into my first drive.
1,Used as instructed,I used it as instructed and it failed as soon as the engine warmed to temperature (waiting overnight for the epoxy to cure). The steam forced its way through the epoxy and began escaping at the edges of the patch.
3,BEST POKE COMIC EVER!!,"Hazel, a ditzy-lovesick kinda gal, is in love with the handsome skilled Pokemon Trainer Almond... He would actually BE skilled if Hazel would let him catch any Pokemon.So basically Almond hates Hazel for not letting him catch any Poke's.But then Grandpa, an old man, tells Hazel that if she catches Pokemon for him he'll prepare a Love Potion for Almond.So Hazel tries to catch Pokemon (Although she didn't catch many) to win the Love Potion and Almond's heart! But many other characters soon appear making Hazel's quest easier/harder than ever! HILARIOUS COMIC!!!!!!!! READ IT EVERYONE!!But this issue is bad comparing to the others really."
1,Completely unsatified,"This bench is exactly what I needed. However, it came with directions that didnt match up with the bench. Some things were NOT pre-assembled that were suppose to be, and some things WERE pre-assembled that were not suppose to be. The result is hardware that doesnt match up and some is missing. No problem, i'll call the 24 hour help line included in the box! I called the company and they said, ""oh we sell that old stuff to Amazon and really cant tell you anything about it"". Wonderful.Good news is Amazon has the greatest return policy ever (UPS home pick-up rules). I just ordered a different one."
5,Very Moving on Many Levels,I had heard her on the Vista Social club Video. She is wonderful and even better focused by herself. She is backed by the other social club members. She is able to stand on her own. Her voice is strong and moves you through all of your emotions. Even if you dont understand spanish her voice alone will move you.
4,Another great BVSC production,"If you liked the previous World Circuit/BVSC productions, you'll be glad to know Nick Gold and the BVSC artists have pulled off another winner with ""BVSC Presents Omara Portuondo"".Like the other BVSC albums, ""Omara"" is characterized by natural, spontaneous, relaxed, yet emotionally-intense performances with minimum post-production work. Also as with all the other BVSC productions, you feel Omara and the musicians are playing and singing for each other rather than for an external audience, and the result is a wonderfully intimate musical experience. Additionally, in ""Omara"" Portuondo is given a very spacious aural setting that showcases her voice without unnecessary layers of musical arrangements (something which marred Ibrahim Ferrer's album). My only tiff with the album is the unnecessary remake of ""Veinte Anos"". The version in the BVSC album is fine enough and we didn't need this somewhat overwrought version."
4,worthwhile for the collector of Cuban music,"For those who are expecting dance music, this is definitely not your CD. The Billie Holiday comparision is apt in some ways: this is melancholy music, not your high charged son montuno or salsa. If you are looking for that type of music, go for some of the other BVSC discs. Some of these tracks are incredible -- and you don't have to listen to Ry Cooder's grating slide on every track. My personal favorite is ""no me llores mas."" This disc brougth back memories of one of my favorite singers of this type of mellow-er music: Esther Borja. Her CD's are out of print (many of them), but Portuondo sings many of the same songs that Borja sang, but with a much huskier voice. If you enjoy the more ballad-like side of Cuban music, you will not be able to get enough of this CD."
4,From the heart....,"I'm not deep into Cuban music, and haven't heard of Omara Portuondo before, but I find this a beautiful and treasurable CD. She sings from the heart of a love that hurts, and in a number of styles including a couple I'm not familiar with: guajiro, bolero, mambo, habanera, etc. I especially enjoyed ""Veinte Anos"" with the trombone and bass dialogue as introduction. And I certainly wasn't expecting her version of Gershwin's ""El hombre que you ame"". The familiar ""Siempre en Mi Corazon"" was another favorite. Yet, I enjoyed each and every one of the other numbers. She has a dramatically expressive voice and can carry one with her emotion. If, as one reviewer indicates, her voice isn't what it once was, it still is, to me, one of the great voices one can hear."
4,Very Pleasant Indeed,Omara has a beautiful and rich voice. The songs are pleasant and warm. I can listen to this CD over and over again because it is up-lifting and relaxing.
2,Music legends should know when to retire.,"The importance of Omara Portuondo in Cuban popular music is undeniable. For those who are now discovering Cuban music, this album might represent something extraordinary, riding the wave of the Buenavista Social Club phenomenon. However, for those who have had the chance of enjoying her songs in the past, this represents a sad call to reality, when Omara cannot emulate her quality of yesteryears. At times, Omara's voice fails to rise above the sound of the orchestra. I guess this could have been solved by better editing."
5,Excellent battery,"This is an excellent battery. I have been using it for a few months now and it is still in excellent condition. I use my cell phone approximately three-four hours a day, so that is quite impressive."
5,The Lord has blessed this man....,"I've been a SCC fan ever since For the Sake of the Call. I've watched the way his music has gone from steady contemporary to the faster rock based cd Declaration and it's safe to say that one thing hasn't changed, the impact of God on this man's life. Steven Curtis writes from the heart and bases the music on truths from Scripture. Just look at the lyrics sheet in the cd and you'll verses he used in the writing of these songs. Some of the verses are outright quoted in the lyrics of the song as well. That is my favorite thing about SCC. He doesn't make room for musical expression at the expense of God focused lyrics. The Lord has blessed him tremendously for this and SCC will be the first to admit it."
3,Duped,"I like the songs on this CD but, it's not Steven Curtis Chapman like the CD says. It's a decoy whose using his name to get noticed. He is worth listening to so why doesn't he use his own name and take the credit for his work?"
4,Classic SCC,"So, I bought the new CD from SCC. This CD is typical SCC. You got your guitar & SCC sound, plus some slower SCC stuff. Hey not trying to down play it at all. SCC is good, always quality stuff, the first song, well enough of Regis already...""Jesus Is Life"" is a 1st class song. Good CD, glad to have it...will not let you down if you like SCC. However, The Great Adventure is still his best song."
5,Another Hit!,"Yes, another excelent title from Steven Curtis Chapman, my favorites include - ""Bring it on"" ""Live out Loud"" ""Jesus is Life"" & ""See the Glory"" ""God is God"" is a bit slow but the truth is excellent, one thing I like about S.C. Chapman over say M.W. Smith, is that Chapman includes Bible references in the booklet. Overall ""Declaration""(CD) is better deal then ""Speechless""(CD) of course the ""Dive""(song) still rains on! Declaration is Highly Recomended, so Bring it on, Steven Curtis Chapman!!!"
3,A rather average offering...,"I realize that this album has been very highly reviewed on Amazon, but I found it to be rather nondescript. Many of the tracks are a rather generic, pop-rock sound, and I had hoped that Chapman would have matured beyond that point at such a stage in his career. To be sure, I love the heart and ministry of SCC, and I respect him greatly. I was just disappointed with this album. It seems that songs which specifically reference Regis asking someone about being a millionaire are trying too hard to be cool and trendy, while also becoming quickly dated. The best track is ""When Loves Takes You In."" Though this album is decent, I wouldn't really recommend it. Some of his other, earlier work is more memorable."
5,Awesome CD! Take it from me!,"The day I heard ""DIVE"" from his album Speechless, I was blown away! Who is this guy? I had to know! Finally, I found out it was some guy called Stephen Curtis Chapman.I've been a fan ever since! I found out about his newest cd Declaration and I got it! Let me tell you, it is incredible!He is an awesome musician and judging by his songs, a faithful chrisitan too! The first song ""Live Out Loud"" is incredible, and if you are like me you will listen to it over and over untill it drives you crazy!! I also love Jesus is Life, Bring it On, God is God, See the glory, Declaration of Dependence, and more! It is a great cd. As I looked over the other reveiws I was pleased. Almost all of them were crazy for the cd or they atleast liked it. That is the way it should be for this cd. WoW! Five stars!!!"
5,Carried me to Jesus,The Song Carry You to Jesus is one of the most powerful songs on this CD along with Magnificent Obsession. These two songs in combination have had an effect on my life like no other songs. I HIGHLY recommend this CD. It will have a profound influence on your life and you will truly be blessed by it.
5,Superb!,"This is yet another album with wonderfully written lyrics -- simple and yet hard-hitting. The up-beat music is great, and the slow tunes are touching. Way to go SCC -- I see more awards in your future. Most importantly, though, is your ability to touch your contemporaries with relevant, inspired words. I can't stop playing it!!!"
3,van a pagar,"a balanced, if superficial, treatment of capital punishment. solid writing style and sense of place. the quintana series has a latter day ricky and lucy romance at its core without the original's comedic genuis."
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"Beautifully executed one-act on the consequences of racism -- not just for the victims of racism, but for everyone. A must-read."
1,"This book represents the racial tensions, that we expirence",This book was originaly played with actor Danny Glover in it it. Like that is like realy cool. Like is it not
3,eh,Well I ddin't use the book so basically this opinion doesn't matter. I just like reviewing things yuh know yo?
5,FUGARD IS BRILLIANT,This story is the best way to find out how 60 pages can well up a flood of emotion.
1,Overpriced and Underpaid,"I can't believe what a rip off this book is. 60 pages and 12 bucks ?? you've got to be kidding me !!!!my kid had to read this for school work. what a load of old tripe. and how anyone can say reading this is better than reading shakespeare ? gordon bennett ! reading tea leaves is better than reading this.don't bother buying this unless you have to - and even then, question whether you really have to. less enjoyable than a good bowel movement !"
2,"Sadly, no longer available",Celestial Seasonings has stopped producing the tea bag version of this almost perfect Earl Grey.The Kurig versions just don't live up to the bag versions.The closest substitute I have been able to find is by Taylors of Harrogate.
1,Horrible - Don't Waste the money or the time,"This movie is beyond horrible, and I am making this judgment after watching very little of the movie. From the second I hit play, I regretted renting it. It is like C or D rate, looks like something a bunch of film students threw together. I don't know if I will even bother finishing it. Do what you want, but I wouldn't waste the 1.99 for this garbage."
3,Good starter for tarot,"This book is not a definitive or in-depth guide to tarot.But it is a great way for a beginner to immediately startusing the cards, the prerequisite for further learnin"
2,Confusing and Counter-Intuitive,"This was the first Tarot book I purchased and subsequently didn't do anything with the Tarot for several years. This book is counter-intuitive and written in a way that makes it difficult to sit down and read. Additionally, the binding and paper are poor on the copy I have which make it worse.Try Tarot for Yourself, Tarot Celebrations and some of the other very well written books in this section."
1,Not for serious readers,"If you truely wish to learn the tarot you must choose a deck that speaks to you and derive your own meanings from them. This book gives you a 'set' responce to each card with no room for personal insights. Also it does deal more with numerology and games, as a reveiwer recently stated, than the real tarot. Some of the spreads, however, have been useful."
5,A great book!,"This is my 2nd buy. When we moved to Switzerland my first book (which I bought about 10 years ago) did not get shipped or got lost in transit. It's so easy to use, so fun to spend time alone with either on sunny days or cloudy days."
2,flat,"The acoustics is very dry, the sound is distant, the playing is uninspiring. It really seems as if the producers just grabbed hold of 3 great players, hired newbie sound engineers, gave them a couple days to practice for the recording session, and hoped for the best.After reading the very very well written liner notes that the sonatas for violin and harpsichord should really be sonatas for harpsichord and violin, I was hoping to hear a prominent harpsichord. Instead the violin is far more prominent and the harpsichord is miked at such a low volume that it is more like bells chiming on a neighbor's front porch on a breezy summer day. This can't be recommended."
5,Perfect!,I bought this book for my son as a special book from his mommy to him. The book expressed everything i wanted to tell him. It is so beautifully written i love to read this book to him as a bedtime story. I would recomend this book to anyone!
5,I loved this book so much!,"I purchased this book for a very special little boy. My friend's grandson was born and only weighed 1 1/2 lbs. He had many complications and remained in the hospital for the first year of his life. I saw this book and decided to purchased it as a gift so the grandparents could read it to him while they spent endless hours sitting beside his glassed in crib. They were thrilled to have such a big, colorful and sentimental book to share with their little grandson that helped convey their feelings to this little guy. The illustarions are wonderful and the message is clear and gives a child the sense of love you have for them. I recommend this book for all parents and grandparents to read to their child. School teachers will like it too."
5,This is a great book!,Such a great book and message forchildren. It provides reassurance and love whichin this day and age are so very important.I love all the books by this author and the illustrations.We feel so positive after reading these books!
1,Poor Qaulity,"My daughters received this book when they were little and it was their favorite book, so I was so excited to purchase it for a baby gift. However, I will not purchase this gift online again. The first book I ordered came to me with the print messed up, it wasn't even readable, so I returned it for a second book which came to me with the pages stuck together, at this point it was too late to get a new one in time for the baby shower so I was very dissapointed in the quality. :("
3,"It's ok, not much more","Like other reviewers posted, the artwork in the book leaves much to be desired. I thought it would be a cute book for my 21 month old, but he doesn't care for it. The pictures look like his scribbles, so he doesn't really pay attention to the story. Me neither, for that matter. Will try it again when he's a little older."
4,cute book,This is a really cute book. Thought it had more to do with a mommy's love but nonetheless a really cute book.
2,More a model than a toy,"Too small for children to get much use out of. Well built and sturdy, but just too small for anything but display. Returned it along with two others that I ordered."
3,On the smaller side...,"It arrived on time, alive and very well packaged, but I'm still very disappointed.My complaint is that based on the picture and description I expected it to be bigger. Too expensive for what it is. I won't buy something like that again."
5,Gorky's last work,"The reproductions in this book are very good. Especially ''the Limit"",""the plow and the song"","" the calendars"". I have several books on Gorky ,but when I don't want to lift up a cocktail table type of book I refer to to this one ""Agony "" and the above works are among my favorites. Dore Ashton was very well respected by Abstract Expressionist I knew of the second generation.The book contains some letters by Arshile to his sister about what he was trying to do with his work.Their are bigger and better books but it has no equal for its size. The price is right.Now by your leave ,I will get back to re-reading Spender ,Auping and Ashton"
4,For all kinds of weather...,"I like it. One size truly fits all, no matter what hairstyle you have that day. It is also great for when your hair isn't in ANY kind of style...you get the picture. Black goes with mostly everything, so you'll get many, many uses out of this one. Should you buy it? Sure--if it's what you're looking for..."
1,Not the hat shown in images,"I was very disappointed when I got this beanie in the mail. I spent a long time looking for one that did not have the large holes near the bottom. The images of this product are very different from the actual thing. I specifically bought this beanie because I did not want one with the more open weave near the bottom, but when the product arrived I was very disappointed to find it was that exact style of hat. I am very displeased with this seller, their product, and their false pictures. This is what the beanie ACTUALLY looks like.Black Crochet Beanie Skull Cap Hat"
2,"Screw ups happen I understand that but,",When it's a lack of attention to detail that tells me how a company works and that I don't want any of my business done with them.
5,The finest travel book I've ever used,"As a relatively experienced traveler who had never been to Prague before, I wanted to make sure I covered all the bases and bought a series of travel guides: Rough Guide, Eyewitness, Let's Go, Fodor's, etc., and studied them all so that my brief (6 day) visit would be as broad and deep as possible. A friend lent me the first edition of the Cadogan Guide and I quickly ordered the 3rd edition. It arrived just before my departure. It is far and away the finest guide I have ever encountered. All of the other guides moved to the bottom of my suitcase back at the pension, and I conquered Prague, Cadogan in hand. Wry, insightful, fact-laden, and witty, I occasionally found myself laughing out loud in the street. The restaurant, bar, and store recommendations were spot on, and led laterally to other adventures. The walking tours were exceptionally well done. I am never travelling without a Cadogan guide again."
3,Critic's Choice: Leonard Maltin's Best Movie Themes of the 90s,"This CD is on two discs, and there are quite a few of my favorite movie themes on it - but it's an over all disappointment, as his taste is not mine in a lot of cases. Still, I pick and choose which ones I will listen to, so fast forward to those not to my taste. I'm very glad I bought this CD as there are included themes I could not find. As always, I've been pleased with my dealings with Amazon and the sellers. I really appreciate the high standards required by Amazon, and have come to trust this method as a favorite place to shop."
2,not what I expected,"No recognizable music from the films, mostly music that is in the bacground that you hardly notice during the film."
2,Barely kept my interest,I was a little dissapointed in the formatting of the book - it provides narrative for each individual before their 'autobiographical' entry. Perhaps you would enjoy that but I was hoping to read strict diary entries. I must admit I got bored with it and started skipping the narratives. I never finished it.
1,Pop History,"A Quilt of Words: Womens Diaries, Letters, and Original Accounts of Life in the Southwest, 1860-1960 by Sharon Niederman is nothing more than a quick fix research project riddled with mediocre scholarship. The book is worth the price only for the primary sources and accounts. Shame on you Ms. Niederman for robbing the graves of America's pioneer women. If you insist on calling your work history, perhaps you should invest some time learning the craft!"
1,Dust: A Tale of the Wired West,"I played Dust many years ago and enjoyed it. When I saw it on Amazon and it said it was compatible with OS X, I ordered it right away. It is NOT compatible with OS X. When I tried to install it I got an error message that says: You can't open the application ""Dust"" because the Classic environment is no longer supported. So, I basically wasted $20, plus shipping. If you're running a current Mac don't bother ordering this title."
3,Not as soft as I wanted,"The design on this boppy cover is awesome.It is very hip with the swirly designs and groovy colors, but the material is fleece (not micro fleece).It pilled up right away and was not very soft."
2,Green Vine Boppy,"I like the boppy. It is great for nursing. Keeps the baby at the perfect height. But I hate the cover. They shouldn't call this color green. It is lime green. Also, I expected it to be a lot softer. I really don't like it and will be returning it."
2,Very poor quality,"The video is of very poor quality. All the motion on the DVD digitizes like it was filmed in a speed unable to handle the motion of sport. At times forward passes causes the ball to nearly disappear due to digital distortion. Extremely disappointing. I would not recommend buying this, there are downloadable HD digital copies that cost far less and are of much, much better quality."
1,this is a professional DVD?,"I just received my Ornage Bowl DVD. I read comments about the poor quality and thought maybe just their TV. Well most were right on. Its one thing not to have Hi Def quality but the angles were poor and depending on what camera angle they recorded from would show how bad to how good the quality was. The worst part is they give you a free 15 minutes online of highlights, but that just goes to show how good the DVD quality should have been. A 3 year old in front of a TV with a BETA camcorder could have done a better job. I gave it one star because I was at the game and wanted backup to my DVR copy."
1,Beware,Agree with other reviewers. Poor quality all the way. The extra 15 minutes of bonus coverage was never available online. Website was for xossports just to try to sell you merchandise and the video was not available.
3,Upset,"I ordered this item almost a month ago, and then i get an email saying that they couldnt locate the item to sell me, what a joke."
3,Not Really Pink More Peach,"Having just recently got this polish this week I was excited to try it on. For me this color came out, after layering it with 3 coats of polish, as more of a light nude color or peach. It is a soft and pretty color, just not as pink as I was expecting by the pictures. Mostly the pictures come very close to the actual color on fingernails with the OPI polishes they picture, but not this time.Better for those looking for a very soft peachy color, rather than a pink."
3,Turned Pop?,"Being a big fan of her previous ""Listen"" CD, I was rather disappointed in ""Dream"". This CD comes across to ""pop"" music with a bubble gummy flavor. Songs sound the same. Michelle has a beautiful voice to enjoy, but even it is over ridden at times by the synthesizers. Wait until Michelle's next CD."
3,Not my favorite...worth a listen just for shock value!,"I must agree with others here that have said that for a pop CD, it's not a bad effort. But fans of Listen and Center of my Universe, if they're anything like me, will not like this newest effort by Michelle Tumes. I can only hope she returns to her roots with her 4th release. Some have written they she will sell more CD's moving over to pop....but if you look at the standing of this CD at Amazon compared to her first two, the sales numbers are much, much, lower......so please Michelle go back to your former style....it's so much more powerful!"
5,She made me a fan,"I met Michelle Tumes at Big Lake 2003. She is down to earth, funny, and one of the sweetest people I think in the music industry. Her album is just the same. I don't usually like the ""Pop"" artists but I like her. I don't have any of her other CDs but I'm completely impressed to Dream.My favorite songs have to be.... let me count...... all of them. ""Live Shines Through"", ""Everywhere"", ""God of my Hope"" are just 3 of the best. I love ""There goes my Love Again"" it reminds me what it feels like to be a girl and fall in love with that guy. Its great :)Thank you Michelle Tumes. God bless you and your life."
2,Regressing With The Lightweights,"Unfortunately, Michelle is now indistinguishable from dozens of other slick popsters who emphasize style over substance. While she does it as well as anyone else - did we really need another?It would seem to be a good move as most reviews are positive, and she undoubtedly will sell more CDs, but I see her selling out leaving a gaping hole that she was filling so nicely. Now she is just one of many that all sound the same - albeit in a slick and well-produced fashion. So Michelle is no longer unique and has thrown her hat in with the many others who cannot be distinguished from anyone else."
3,I prefer the old stuff,I prefer Listen and Universe. When I first popped in the CD I thought I had my teens CD. I find the instrumentation and other vocals dominate most of the songs.
3,Disappointing after her other albums,"I loved ""Listen"" and ""Center of My Universe"" so much that I got this CD without listening to any of the songs first. I was extremely disappointed to discover that she had fallen into the pop music pit of overdone editing, electronic embellishments, and half-hearted lyrics. Even her vocal style seems to have lost its enchanting celtic tones that were easily captured in her earlier, more natural and classic style that I enjoyed in her first CDs; ""Healing Waters"" and ""Christe Elesion"" were my favorite songs. Something about this latest CD ""Dream"" just makes me cringe and sigh. I suppose you might like it if you've never heard her other albums, but if you prefer Enya over the Spice Girls, then I'd recommend buying ""Listen"" or ""Center of My Universe"" instead."
2,3rd Time Isn't The Charm - Sad Regression Into Bubblegum Pop,"I am perhaps the biggest Tumes fan you could find when it comes to her previous two albums, ""Listen"" and ""Center Of My Universe"" - those are unmatched in so many ways when held up to almost any other vocal album. The music found on those can be spiritually uplifiting, relaxing, moving, and stirring. ""Dream"", however, trys to show Ms. Tumes as nothing more than a Christian Brittany Spears. Ugh. Glad I know better. But if this is your first foray into Tumes' work, run away. Get the other discs, but skip this one. It is a major disappointment to me, and I struggled to make it through one full rotation. PLEASE - Michelle! Go back to the heartfelt music you introduced yourself with! If you continue on this genre path, you'll find yourself with a warehouse full of unsold albums! I love the old style - bring it back!"
3,Michelle?,"What happened to the old Michelle? While I recognize she's trying to venture out into new areas by producing a pop CD I miss the great music she had on ""Center of the Universe"" and ""Listen""."
3,Not as good as her 1st album,"I think she falls away from her roots in this album, there are a couple good songs but not like what she use to sing."
3,I like her other style better,"Yes, I loved her other styles SO MUCH better in the ""Listen"" and the ""Center of my Universe"" albums. Those were just HER. When I got this ""Dream"" album and heard that is was pop, I was disappointed. I always thought she sounded like a Christian Enya. That's why I liked her so much. Which I'm praying for Enya to become a strong Christian with strong Christian lyrics as well. Please please please, Michelle we DO want to hear you go back to your roots. We want YOU and your unique Michelle Tumes sound back!!! :)"
2,You get what you pay for,The zippers failed on this bag within a realatively short amount of time. More specifically the stitching pulled through the zipper material and there wasn't enough material left to repair. I chalked this up to experience and shelled out the money for Saddleman Bags. I do not recommend this product for anything other than very lightweight items. This bag also doesn't have anything inside to keep its shape when empty. This is one of those items you don't want to skimp on.
4,Spread textbook,"Courtney Smith's textbook is specifically and comprehensive about spreads.His whole book is about spreads and nothing but spreads. Probably the most useful Spread book from the fundamental perspective.He has a lot to teach there is a lot to learn. It is the kind of book you'll keep in your spread-trading library. But will not by itself excite you to get up and trade.It is comprehensive in that it stays on the subject like a dog with a bone, unlike Schwager's books that are all over the futures game.He has a lot of experience and is well known in the field of spreads. This book is in my top ten Spread Traders library."
2,Definitely not the complete guide.,"This book provides little more than a pedestrian introduction to commodity spreads. The book includes quite a bit of information that would best be left to other tomes: introduction to least squares regression (you would do better to use a Statistics 101 book), development of a trading system (get a book on trading systems/methods...), etc. The only material that I thought carried unique insight was the brief portion on EuroDollar Futures. There was only shallow discussion on analysis of futures patterns, or market tendencies. This book would only be useful if you know NOTHING about spreads."
3,Assigning Stars is hard . . .,"On the one hand, the show is compelling and captivating. On the other hand, so is a train wreck. The difference being, that when I witness a disaster outside my television, I usually do what I can to assist and make things better. Here all I can do is watch, and hate myself for doing so.The show has improved my life though . . . I now ask myself WWJD What would June (Honey Boo Boo's Mom) Do? And I do the opposite. Never before has television served as such a cautionary tale . . ."
2,crappy quality,The quality was horrible. .the sound didn't match there lips...overall bad and a horrible app for ps3..will not use again.
2,disgusting,I just don't know why anyone would want to watch this. Self satisfied poorly behaved people. Parents raising their children to have lower standards that they do themselves.
1,Sad. (I prefer zero stars for this rating),Everybody likes to see a trainwreck and this definately is it but alas everybody keeps driving eventually. This shows got two seasons tops.
1,Appalling,"To the person that gave this a 5 star review, I would imagine that you must be part of the family. No one is being pretentious. The fact that they glorify obesity and lack of education, along with completely unhealthy lifestyles is absolutely appalling. They feed their TODDLER highly caffeinated beverages, including ENERGY DRINKS....this is something that I will not buy my 16 year old son! I am a nurse, and it is proven that highly caffeinated beverages are extremely damaging to children's HEARTS!Seriously, why CPS has not intervened with this family, I will never understand. They claim this child LOVES pageants, but every time she is in one, she cries, because she can't win! Jeez. I imagine this little girl is going to require lots of therapy along with her other medical care that the lifestyle her parents push on her is going to cause.TLC should be ashamed for glorifying it. The only reason anyone watches it, is because it is a train wreck."
4,disgustingly funny..,great show... what a disgusting display of tv entertainment!no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!
1,Horrible...,"Just happened to catch an episode on TV a couple of weeks ago. I had never heard of it before so my fiance decided to watch it. TLC must be running out of good show ideas because this one really hits rock bottom. A few people I know brought up the show in a conversation and were discussing how terrible it was too. It's kind of alarming that anyone would be into watching something like this. LoL, one of my friends had said he could sum up the show in a sentence.... ""Rednecks with big dreams and little potential."" Not saying that they are those kind of people but really anyone can do what they do on the show."
4,Good,I am fascinated by this show. So hokey and yet can't stop myself from watching. Keep asking are these people for real?
5,Honey Boo Boo you've won my vote for Grand Supreme,"It wouldn't be reality tv if it wasn't a spectacle! These GA rednecks are self-proclaimed and proud. At first you can't help but watch, and by the end of the show you're hooked. Honey Boo Boo and her family have no regrets and no excuses, what you see is what you get and I love it!! You can't help but be charmed by Alana and her very one-of-a-kind family, and God love them for just putting it out there for the world to see. Sugar Bear you're a sweet man for putting up with so many overcharged female personalities. A genuine family who wants to see their little girl succeed, and you can't help but root for Honey Boo Boo...she's hilarious and in her own way adorable! You better redneckneconize!!"
1,Horrifying Honey Boo Boo,"I watched a couple episodes for the ""train wreck"" factor, and it was worse than anything I could imagine. Incredibly sad and horrifying."
1,Four bulb burnt out within 5 months,I bought 7 of these for my bedroom recessed ceiling lighting in late August.It is now mid-January (5 months later) and 4 have burnt out.
5,Happy me,Can not believe how easy it was getting this product from Amazon.com. I was looking for this product in many stores without success. Thank you! Looking forward for my next purchase.
4,"Ansel Adams, eat your heart out.....j/k",Great book. Photo Jounalism is a passion of mine. This book helped add to that.
5,"Excellent! If you like Train, You'll like this","I picked up this CD 5 years ago and it continues to be one of my favorites. If this band had gotten some top-line producing, I have no doubt it would have made the leap.The songs have depth and feeling. Wonderful snappy lyrics and a soulful,everyman singer that draws you into the music.I was amazed then and continue to be at the skillful songwiting. I would have loved more albums.Skip the other album available, it is poorly produced and most of the songs appear here and in much better quality."
4,Spragga fully loaded this cd with tight beats and lyrics,"This new one from Spragga takes him back to the top again. Afer Sean Paul, beenie, man, reggae Gold 2000, and bounty killa I thought this was it for good reggae this year...but I was wrong. This whole cd is tight from begining to end and he even got foxy brown to rhyme with him on one song..and it's tight! Anyone with doubts abotu this cd should check this out because there is only a few songs that I htink is just aiight. He gets concious, raw, brings the dancehall jams and everything else into one. The only one i'm waiting on now is the new Buju banton and tanya stephens but for now this will keep things going. Good cd to add to your reggae collection.Fully Loaded!"
5,spragga's new release like all the others is # 1,"spragga benz has been and continues to be a wonderful artiste, his latest album is testiment to that and is perfect for anyone. i love you spragga! keep up the good work."
2,Spragga U Can Do Better Than This,"Man, this CD is commerical-reggae garbage. There's really only 2 songs on here. The rest is talking about the female sexual organ (check ""Pum Pum Conqueror""), sex, and violence with some terrible lyrics!! And what's messed up is that Spragga Benz can rap (Check out songs like ""She Nuh Ready Yet"" and ""Big Tings A Gwan""). So Spragga has talent but on his CD he experiemented with too much rap. I don't wanna hear that mess. Listen, if you want a CD that talks about the girls and stuff like that-- Get Mr. Vegas' CD called ""Damn Right (2001)""-- that CD is riddim-driven! Vegas raps about women and all that stuff but his lyrics are cute, funny and hot. And oh yeah-- Sean Paul does it hot with the girl's thing too. Check out ""Gimme The Light"" and ""Stage One""Peace"
5,An amazing book!,"Hi everyone. If you're looking for a very horrifying book, you've come to the right place. I've borrowed this book from a friend of mine and she said that this book is rather scary. After reading this story, I think what she said was right. So hurry and read this book. You will not be disappointed!"
1,A boring book,"I didn't care for this book. To be honest I detested it. I liked the ending but not the rest of the book. I didn't think it was exciting. Oh, poor poor Emily gets her report erased by her evil stepsister! Oh I worked on it for days! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Oh help me, The mad eraser is still on the loose! Stop me before I erase again! Come on! That doesn't exactly strike terror in the hearts of children in inner city Detroit! I think Allison Muller's book, The Deserted hills is much better. She is a much better author!"
5,Very interesting book.,"Emily wants to like her new stepsister. But Jessie doesn't make it easy for her. As soon as Jessie moves in, she takes over emily's room, starts wearing Emily's clothes, makes secret late-night calls on Emily's phone-and that's just the beginning! Before long, Emily is living in total fear of her stepsister. Emily tries complaining to her parents. But Jessie is such a good liar, no one will believe Emily! Emily's terror mounts when she picks up Jessie's past. Did Jessie really murder someone? Does she plan to murder again? Emily knows she much find out the rest of her stepsister's dark secret. Her own life depends on it! Original."
5,The Stepsister,RL Stine is a great writer and I have many of his books. This was great. I also have S. Sister two.
3,Sisters,"Emily finds her new stepsister Jessie very annoying. She takes her clothes and lies, and then her dog is stabbed. Emily is certain that her stepsister is mental, but no one believes her.It wasn't such a bad book and I kind of liked it but I had some issues with it. The ending has kind of been done before in ""Blind date"" and ""The new girl"". And more inportant: The way the mother in the family reacted when the dog was killed! She told Emily to relax, like it was just a piece of ruined cloth or something, not a living animal! That was too much for my taste."
4,Stepsister,"This book I just couldn't put down, it is so good and makes you want to keep reading. I am the type of person that's hates reading but there was something about this book. It is the way the author uses his words it is a suspenseful book. I recommend this book to people that are not looking for a long dramatic book but one that states all the facts. It is a fun book to talk about to your friends."
4,It was Prety Good.,"So-So.It was allright but i could sense the ending on page 75!...Not as good as most Fear Street books,but hey,they can't ALL be Perfect can they?!The Plot was Simple.The accidents leading up to the end were pretty freaky.You should read this book,But don't exspect nightmares!..."
3,It was okay,The plot was way to odvious to me. I think that is because I have read way to many fear street books and know that the murderer is not who they make it look like it is. That is why it is to odvios. Thanks for reading! :)
3,It was okay,I didn't like this one as much as I liked the stepbrother.. Ifyou would really like to know about this book you would have to readit because it is really hard to understand and it is forthe age group of like junior high.
4,Really cool!!!,This book was awsome!!! I couldn't put it down ti was so good!!! This book is one of my favorite Fear Street's
4,Very good! Once again R.L. Stine has surprised me!,"I really liked this book. After a while I couldn't put the book down. R.L. Stine always surprises me with his unexpected endings, and this time he really got me. I recommend this book to anyone that can become jealous at times."
5,"A poem in urls, a riddle in great foreign words","It's easy to love coldbacon.com, but it's easier for bibliophiles to enjoy this compilation of rants, insane journal entries, parody and more. It is a unique piece of modern art, taking the peculiarly intimate displacement of accidental web tourism and packaging it in a seductive little paperback that will tease you on the bus or in the broom closet. Has anything remotely similar been done before? I'd be interested to know, but CB's voice is inimitable ... This is your brain. This is your brain with a slab of coldbacon. Much juicier! no question..."
5,an endless supply of great Bacon bits,"The blog written by the narcissistic and petulant chief of the Amazon head-hunting tribe is among the great comic creations of the new century. You will find yourself trying to quote from it until you realize that there are not really any gags or jokes in the whole book, but it is the comic sensibility that is hilarious, and so original. A bull's eye from Cold Bacon's poisoned blow dart."
4,when is the next book available,Johnny's adventures are fun for reading to little boys who usually only hear stories about girls or animals at this age. The good guy wins and makes friends in the process. It reinforces a positive relationship with authority figures and has fun products we made at a sleep over. I remember these from my youth but today's kids have no idea.I also gave this book as a gift to a friend whose taught Sunday School at her church. She had a little boy in her class who had lost his father in an accident the year before. She let him take the book home with him after reading it in class.I want to see Johnny's next adventure. Thanks for an easy to explain story with great illustrations!
2,A story which says nothing,"I have just finished this book and it has nothing to say. Descriptively it is good, but there is nothing said.... there is no depth to it. It is not a book that is ""of use"". It is a quaint story. Perhaps I am a book snob, but read even the first chapter of ""The Tree of Man"" by Patrick White, which is a truly magnificent book, written about a similar subject and it has more subtext, more depth and more importantly says something about the human condtion. This book does not. It is a good first novel, and descriptively it does well, but it misses the mark."
3,Darkest bass in the whole damn place,"This cd should be a bass cd instead of a breaks one.This is some really dark kinda bass/breaks,different than what Im used to hearing.This is really not one of my favorite albums,it's way too bassey to be considered really good,and missing some of BA's original style.The only good thing about this album is that it's got the bass and I mean da bass to make your woofers move air like they have never moved before.Get this cd if your more into bass than breaks.If you wanna get into baby anne,I recommend you start with either of her ""Bass Queen in the Mix"" cd's."
3,Jeff,"I picked up this CD 4 months ago on an impulse buy. Its decent and I would say its her best work to date. I am a huge breaks fan, but Florida Breaks are my least favorite. She definitely keeps the bass heavy and chooses some good tracks. But overall this disc, as well as a lot of Florida Breaks, is missing one key element...""funk"".Its not a bad CD to have in your collection if you really want to push the bass on your stereo. But I would reccommend that you pick up some Canadian Breaks DJs or UK Breaks. I think the best breaks DJs in the world are coming out of Canada.If you want to hear some good, funky, dirty breaks pick up Slammin the Breaks 2 by Krafty Kuts (UK) or anything from Czech (Vancouver) before you get this."
2,Ho-Hum,"I bought this based on reviews of ""Bass Queen in the Mix."" To me it sounds like the West Coast edition of Northern Exposure without the 4/4 house beat. In other words, its very electronic sounding, almost completely non-vocal and not very funky at all. I listened to ""Eargasm"" by Plump DJ's and Icey's ""Funky Breaks"" after this and it's definitely missing variety, skill in mixing and that ""neck snapping"" funky quality that make the Plumps and Icey so indispensible. Not too bad but not that interesting either. I prefer her ""Mixtress"" and still have not heard ""Bass Queen..."" BTW, my speakers are flat down to below 30 hz and I didn't find the recording quality or the bass that impressive. Listen to Crystal Method's ""PHD"" or ""Block Rockin' Beats"" by Chemical Brothers after this to see what I mean."
1,Rewritten VB6,This not a VB.NET-Book but a rewritten VB6-book. The authors did not show the new ways to develop .NET-Software.
2,Major problems with iPod video,Please read reviews on the white version of this product for details on iPod problems.
2,bad FM reception,A good sounding unit on I-Pod and AM modes but very poor FM reception. The unit was returned.
3,Come on JBL... fix this!!!,"The unit is fantastic except for one major issue - the wake to song feature doesn't work on newer iPods. From what I hear, JBL recommends contacting Apple to backdate your iPod firmware version so the feature will work properly.Yeah right. Stupid idea, bad recommendation.JBL - You are a big company with a reputation to uphold. Please provide a fix for this yourselves. This issue is yours, not Apple's."
3,Good sound ... menu & others not so good,"Sound quality excellent ... can't complain here.Menu is not so good, and integration with iPod sucks (you cannot program what you want it to play in the morning if you have latest software on iPod or Gen 5 iPod .... that really sucks !!!)."
3,Could be better,"Before purchasing this item I read many of the reviews posted on amazon. Many said what I am about to say, but I chose to ignore them. I should have listened! This clock sounds good and looks good, that's where the good stops. It is supposed to increase in volume when the alarm function is used. Mine did not. Only came on at a jarring volume. No way to control it. I sent it back to amazon for a replacement. The new one worked the same way. I now sent it back to JBL for a replacement, and am waiting arrival of that one. It really needs a remote control. Using the ipod controls while it is docked in the unit is a pain. I bought my son a $70 Memorex ipod clock radio. It came with a remote. And the alarm volume increases automatically like this one is supposed to. The display points up so it is hard to read from bed without lifting your head up. Sound quality and appearance are the only reasons this unit rates three stars."
1,A truely inferior product,"Although it is relatively low cost, it is also low quality when compared to competitive albeit more expensive products. It provides moderate lubrication and very little lather."
4,Solid shaving soap,this is the second Colonel Ichabod Conk soap I have bought and I will definitely come back for more. A solid shaving soap which makes your face nice and slick for your razor to glide over and with a nice scent to it. The scent is not very strong and does not stay with you for very long but that's what aftershave / lotions are for anyway.
5,Love the smell,my husband and father received this in their stockings. The Colonel Conks shaving soap has a great smell and lathers better than other brands they've tried.
4,Pleasant but can be too strong at times,"It leathers up great - just a small amount on the brush and you're ready to go. The almond smell is not for everyone and while pleasant, it's really not for big phifs. Stop smelling and just start shaving."
3,Good for a beginner,Or someone really unorganized. This book really had nothing to offer that you can't learn off an organization site. Total waste of money if you've been scrapping a while or have a magazine. They took a whole book to tell you the same things Creating Keepsakes did in a 3 page article. It really was not at all helpful to me and I ended up returning it.
3,Good pictures....,"This book had wonderful pictures and great resources in it.... the thing I found most helpful was the manufacturers, it listed the products you could use and where to find them... other than that, there was nothing more in this book that you couldn't find on the internet at no cost....."
4,Great Scrapbooking Book,This is a great book. Great information for organizing your scrapokking space and items.
2,not that helpful,Not that helpful. Dont waste your money unless you can get it for cheap at used book store.
2,Bettered by new texts - for die hard dogmatic VBM fans only,"Authored by three Marakon gurus and unfortunately the book does not hang together. After a fairly good first section laying out the principles of value creation, the authors then go overboard on the financial numbers and equations. Those who make it to the end will see the text lighten up with chapters on planning and corporate issues. I would recommend this book only to fans of the Marakon view of the VBM world. It is unbalanced in so far as it is not a comprehensive analysis of VBM, pluses and minuses. Equally it is merely a rehash of some traditional tools and techniques. Unless you are familiar with VBM, this is not the book to start with. A better way in is to assemble a view of VBM from a variety of authors including some of the original Rappeport stuff. At the same time journal articles are now showing how old and under-developed the Value Imperative is."
3,Unworthy biobgraphy,"Although a pretty good biography (apart from undue repetitiousness of quotations and lapses of good syntax), the book is woefully lacking as a military history. For examples: Bradley's failure to follow up the break-through of the COBRA operation is inadequately discussed. Eisenhower's major failure to foresee the logistical problems inherent in eastward movement of the Allied forces, counting as it did on ports in western and NW France, is not targeted, nor is his inexplicable failure toreplace Lee as Deputy CIF in charge of logistics examined. The sorry plight of a successful army out of gas on the brinkof victory undoubtedly prolonged the war and cost many thousands of lives. A friend of mine, a military history buff, oncereferred to IKE as ""Staff Officer Eisenhower."" He wasn't even a good staff officer!"
4,Great: read like a novel,Simply wonderful. Very few dull moments permeate this this truly remarkable biograghy. I enjoyed it thouroughly; I read a lot of WWII history and rarely run into a book that reads more like a thriller than a dull regurgitation of dusty history. The possible exception might be Stephen Ambrose.The end of the book is trully haunting and chilling. You will know what I mean if you have read it!Grab it this winter and curl up in front of the fire. You will try to put it down but it will keep you up past your bed time.
5,GREAT READ OF A FIGHTING GENERAL/ HARDCOVER,"ENJOYED BOOK VERY MUCH, AUTHOR MAKES A POTENTIAL BORING TALE, INTERSTING. THOSE NOT INTERESTED IN A MANS LIFE UNFOLDS, DONT BOTHER. OTHERWISE AUTHOR TELLS PATTONS LIFE AS IT UNFOLDS, WARTS AND ALL. TODAY HEROS ARE HARD TO COME BY, ALL WANT TO BE POLITICIANS, NOT WARRIORS. PATTON FAR FROM A POLITICIAN,WITH A TOUCH OF EGOMANIA, PERHAPS MORE THAN A TOUCH. NONE THE LESS, A GREAT READ, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WW11."
4,Good investigation by D'Este,"This book gets into the phsyche and inner working of Patton better than Ladislas Farga's book ""Patton: Ordeal and Triumph"" which was THE book for years. In D'Este's book we learn about Patton and his trouble's with dyslexia and a high pitched squeely voice to his future days with a motor mouth. However, we are also introduced to a very determined man with incomperable drive and genius in studying his opponents. Patton was a man with little in his life outside of war and family. As George C. Scott said in the film playing Patton: ""God how I hate the 20th century"". I think this describes Patton after reading this biography."
5,Best book about an historical figure,"Patton: A Genius for War by Carlo D'Este is the best biography about an historical figure I have ever read. D'Este's research is deep and extensive, and the book is interesting and as readable as an excellent novel. I literally was fascinated, and couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it."
5,The Best!,"This book, by far, is the best biography I've ever read on Patton. I've read a couple of others but this one is the best. After reading this one, I am not sure I want to read another one I have waiting in the wings. As with all bios, this one reviews his ancestors beginning with his grandfather's contributions to the Civil War. Rather than go into detail, it's not until about halfway through the book (about page 400) where the book really takes off for me. This is where he begins his WWII career, the one we are all so familiar with. And, the author paints a rather objective view of Patton - doesn't glamorize him nor is it overly critical. The author's viewpoint is quite neutral and it makes for fascinating reading. If you have to read just one book on Patton, this is the one."
4,ENJOYED THE BOOK - VERY READABLE AND INFORMATIVE,VERY GOOD DETAILED COVERAGE OF GEORGE PATTON'S LIFE. MY SECOND COUSIN WAS FRIENDS WITH GEORGE PATTON'S SISTER NITA PATTON. ONLY THING MISSING WAS HIS ACTUAL BATTLE STRATEGY AGAINST GERMAN ARMY. PERSONAL LIFE COVERED VERY WELL.
3,"Written for the history ""buff""","This book is basically a retelling of the story that many of us have read and heard over and over. Nothing really new is exposed, nor are any new insights into the man provided.If one wishes to seriously understand Patton, all study begins and ends with ""The Patton Papers."""
4,Combat General,"A detailed and comprehensive account of one of the greatest combat generals the U.S. Army has ever had. The author successfully captures the many sides of General Patton, going beyond the rather one-sided interpretation in the movie ""Patton"". The first sections of the book center on the general's early personnel life. Many of these chapters drag, but once the book enters into the battle chapters the author's skill and intimate knowledge of military history really shines. The author spends considerable time detailing the personnel relationships between Patton and the Army's top generals such as Eisenhower, Bradley, and Clark."
4,This book is very busy but it is an interesting portrait.,"All my knowledge of Patton was from the film, I read this biography to learn more about him. I think Mr. D'Este has written a fine book but he jumps all over the place. He introduces facts and people at will and it is sometimes hard to follow.The author gives a balanced view of a very complex man. Patton was born and programmed for greatness. He had many faults, insecurities and excelled at alienating his superiors. He was both a loving and sometimes cruel husband and father. He worshipped his ancestors almost as fervently as he worshipped God.Patton was an accomplished actor who would change his personality and demeanor to suit a situation. Mr. D'Este describes in detail Patton's numerous indiscretions and successes. The book is most informative."
5,DVD on Knife making,"Hi, For the Budget minded & beginner knife maker this is a very good DVD. Before paying thousands of dollars on knife making equipment you must check out these 2 DVD's. You will find out if you want to pursue this craft full time or as hobby or not at all. In any case I really liked the DVD's, lot's of tips and information.Good luck and try it out. Knives are great gifts and survival item's Not to mention you could be the next Great Knife maker and make a living from it.One last note, be very careful and follow all the safety rules to make your new craft a pleasure able one.Thanks for your time.Regards,Johnny Ray"
3,Concept a little over the heads of young children,"The reverse psychology aspect of this book is a little beyond the comprehension of younger kids. It was confusing, and though I tried to explain that the things the book says you SHOULD do are actually the things you SHOULDN'T do, it was lost on my child. So much so that I've hid the book. Maybe I'll try again when she's older."
2,Not so great,"I love the concept of this book. However, the illustrations are lacking, it doesn't flow, and it just doesn't live up to the idea behind the book."
5,Great book!,"I ordered this book for the Lucy Calkins writing workshop series and can't wait to read it to my first grade class! My boyfriend (also a first grade teacher) read it to his class for a lead into writing about ""How to be a good friend"". Excellent book and really funny!"
4,How To Lose All Your Friends,"This book promotes positive social behaviors by telling what NOT TO DO. It is like reverse psychology. It is a humorous way to illustrate why certain behaviors are annoying.I especially like Rule #4 that says ""Be a poor sport. When you play tag and someone tags you, lie and say they missed. If you're losing a board game, knock off all the pieces."" This will be a great book for the first day of school to show the kids how to interact with others in a more positive way."
4,Great Book for kids with Behavioral Problems/Social Skills deficits,"The title really gets the kids attention in my waiting room. While I cannot get kids to read what I would like them to, if I leave this around they will gravitate towards it on their own because the title appeals to the oppositional part of them and they are curious to find out more. Also nice and short so its not a huge task to read."
2,How to Lose All Your Friends,"For the amount of money I paid, I was very disappointed with the quality of the item. It was a mini book....not the real size of a normal paperback. That book should have been priced half of what it was priced at. Buyers beware!"
1,Mean book!!!,"This is a horrible and mean book. This book teaches children how to be mean and cruel to their friends. The author has attempted to use sarcasm and humor, which is completely lost on the population of readers/listeners this book is intended for. This book is for preschool and early school-age children, who do not have the emotional, developmental, or cognitive skills to make sense of the sarcasm in the book. These young readers/listeners are concrete in their thinking and may truly believe that the way to make friends is to copy all of the mean, aggressive, rude, and asocial behaviors depicted in this book. As an early childhood psychologist, I am appalled that anyone would read this book to their children or classes. There are many more books out there that promote prosocial behavior and positive interaction among friends, without having to resort to sarcasm and meanness."
5,How to Lose All Your Friends,This book is a great book to teach children about politeness and friendship. I use this book during the first week of school to build community within the classroom.
4,A great book if you want to lose all of your friends.,"I think a kid would like this book because it has great pictures. It is a great book for children who want to lose all their friends. I think a kid would not like this book because it isn't really funny or interesting. It is more of a handbook or guide. You shouldn't read this book if you don't want to lose your friends. If I could change one thing, it would be to add more words to it. The overall rating would be a 5, on a 1-10 scale, 1=lowest, 10=highest."
5,Candlestick patterns work -- regardless of whether the market rises or falls !!,"I attended Steve's seminar 2 years ago, and have been using candlestick patterns ever since. This is an excellent book which provides an easy-to-read introduction to candlestick charts. Steve's approach is a major element of my trading plan."
2,Too many typos create much confusion...,Too many typos in this book. Book refers to bulls when it means bears making some sections a confusing mess. At this price the book should've been carefully proof-read before release.
5,Great Reading,"This is an excellant written book,simple step by step explanation of the candlestick methodology. I was impressed with the ease in which I learned the 12 Major candlestick patterns.This book has taken the mistry out of candlestick reading,and it will place a wealth of knowledge in the hands of newbee traders like myself.Excellent book."
2,"Careful, this is just another candlesticks book","I bought the digital book after reading glowing reviews in the amazon.com site.The book contains detailed descriptions on a large number of candelstick patterns. But that is about it.While beginners may find value in the book, advanced users of technicals with knowledge of candlesticks patterns may not get much out of reading it. At least, I did not."
3,Anything better out there?,Poorly edited and at times difficult to read. This is frustrating because the candlestick technique seems worthy of consideration but the manner in which the material was presented in this book leaves one lacking confidence in the system.
2,"Not Testable, no evidence...","Skimmed through the Profitable Candlestick Trading: Pinpointing Market Opportunities to Maximize Profits , by Steven W Bigalow. Despite the claims that it would help Investors to ""Pinpointing Market Opportunities and Maximizing Profits"" it is really hard not to think, that the book is nothing but a quick-fix for a 'trading-coach' looking to make a quick buck, when his customers have deserted him.There is no scientific or testable biases in the book, only a bleak summary of 'conventional' wisdom. He presents chart after chart, points out profitable trades, but completely leaves out any testable setups. This book will remain on the shelf and will not probably not even serve as a reference guide. I would only rate this as a useful guide for someone that has a low hurdle for wasting money on non-testable charting."
1,Copycat Material,"Another candlestick book that gets almost all of its material from Steve Nison's candlestick books.Mr. Bigalow has taken Mr.Nison's work and ideas (Mr. Nison was the first to reveal candlesticks to the West) without so much as acknowledging this. This book just adds another indicator to the candlesticks without much new insight.Mr.Nison's books are considered THE bibles of candlesticks. My feeling is if you are going to by a book on candlesticks, why not go to the master?"
5,"fresh voice, easy to get lost in","Monica writes with a style that could captivate any reader, from the most laid back to the most impatient. her voice is modern, and she can move a story from beginning to end almost seamlessly. there are no genre walls holding her back, and her stories are delivered without pretense. some people --mostly writers-- say that a story, even fiction, should tell the truth, its another way of saying ""stay true to yourself"", Monica has a talent to do just that and it causes her prose to shine.pick up Grayson Point, you will be glad you did.best,dan"
5,Want a good story to read? Read this one!,"This book opened a whole new genre for me. I am an avid reader. Yet, I tend to be picky about my reads. This book so impressed me that I have recomended it to all of my friends. I am doing so now to you. This is a great read. Captivating from the start. (And I am not easily captivated.) Ms. Robinson's view of this old tale is fresh and ""workable"". Now, when I travel back East, (and I do), I look at people trying to ""pick out"" likely characters. <GBG> I love when a book stays with you after the last page, and this one does. Please Ms. Robinson, write some more! An avid reader, Rhoni Lee"
5,Finally a soprano with lyric beauty,"Much of vocal pedagogy today focuses on how to make loud singers. Opera is everything and beauty and intonation are sometimes left at the wayside for the sake of power. But the music of Bach is certainly not about volume.Nancy Argenta sings these cantatas with a clear, warm lyric tone that gives me shivers. The line, the clarity of the intonation, and the musicality surpasses almost any singer I know, especially most of today's opera stars.If you have ever been frustrated with singers like Cecilia Bartoli because you can't even tell what note they're singing, there is hope.I highly recommend this recording."
1,Extremely Mediocre,"I must say I had high hopes for this book, but it didn not deliver. Everything in it was obvious and I didn't feel like I learned anything at all. For instance, Myers goes on for a while about file formats and the different softwares and what they do. If you were a graphic design student and you were reading this book, wouldn't you already know all this stuff about what software like Adobe Illustrator does?Her design samples are boring, they lack creativity, and they just plain drag the book down. I do not reccommend this book, though unfortunately, there aren't many if any good portfolio books out there... Maybe next time, Debbie."
3,Neat Book,"Put it to use for my graphic design class and feel it helps.But, there is no substitution for making your own profile and discuss with those who have done it before.Speaking to those with experience will give more impact than any book."
1,Mostly Useless Book,"I was very disappointed by this book. The design examples, with an occasional exception, are very weak; and the content is so generic and obvious that it yields virtually no valuable insight at all."
2,Fluff,"This book contained an extraordinarily large amount of fluff. I could synthesize the entire book into far fewer pages. The principles reported in the book may indeed work, but I feel you could read the summaries at the end of each chapter and gain just as much as if you had read the chapter itself. Personally, I feel that using the strategy doesn't filter the universe of stocks enough. You need to check more than just a couple of ratios to determine whether not only is a stock a good purchase, but is it a good time to buy the stock. In the very populated world of investment books, there are many better options."
4,Excellent Summary,"If you've read any other contrarian investing books, I don't think much is new here, but if you haven't read any, then this is a great read. Nicely organized, reasonably easy to read."
5,Excellent!,"Contrarian Investing provides some of the key's tp profiting from other's mistakes. In clear language, enhanced by easy-to-use rules, Gallea and Patalon outline a solid investment discipline -- grounded in hard numbers and backed by years of rsearch. This book taught me how to think like a contriann and how to buy and when to by...""Down-by-Half"" can make you rich and happy.."
3,Decent humorous Oriental Adventure,"This is NOT a serious adventure. It's for one of those nights when no one really feels like concentrating on the dire drama of the campaign, and just wants to crash with good friends and laugh it up for awhile. The menace of the Dragon Claw is everywhere! (Mad Monkey doesn't like this.) Since there aren't any real heroes anymore, some old guy needs to train some new scapeg... um, recruits to deal with the menace. And now, Young Grasshopper, the time has come for you to leave this place... a fun, amusing adventure for levels 6-9."
1,They should pay you to buy this thing!!!,"I bought one of these doorstops and the only feeling I got was that I wasted $50. It has 45 second ESP but it skips after 10 seconds. unless you move the batteries around enough the motor won't turn. You cant turn it off until its done finding (or more often not finding) the disc. This thing dosent even make a good door stop. I give this thing zero stars, but they don't have an option for that."
4,"Sturdily made, function fine, but pick up dirt and squeaks","I have six of these on a wood storage cart, used on a smooth concrete floor. They make it very easy to move, rotate, and push sideways against a wall even when heavily loaded. They'll ride over slight obstructions with an extra push. Only quibbles are that the open bearings pick up dirt and sawdust, and squeak. But for a wood shop they appear a good choice."
3,Picture on Amazon not the same as actual product,"The style of the product we received is the same as depicted & the quality of the caster appears to be very nice. That being said, the smooth, antiqued finish you see in the image is not at all what we received. The caster has somewhat of a bumpy finish and pretty much looks nickle coated (bright, not tarnished and even nickle coloring). We kept the caster because I still can't find a style quite like this anywhere else. I'm not sure I would have ordered it if I the image reflected the actual look of the product. You can attempt to antique the finish yourself.Again, the style is that depicted but the texture and color is almost exactly the same as the product I've linked in this review:Shepherd Hardware 9782 Steel Wheel Swivel Plate Casters"
1,"Terrible mouse, very poor quality","I should start this review by saying I'm appalled that this company has the gall to put this horrible product on the market. I bought this mouse brand new, and started having problems almost immediately. The cursor would just stop moving periodically. I had a little luck unplugging and re-inserting the wireless receiver -- but after a couple minutes this trick stopped helping. Then I had issues with the buttons not functioning. I tried this mouse on two separate computers, both of which had the system requirements to run the mouse properly, but it did not help any. Luckily I was able to return the product with no hassle."
3,Just my thoughts,"The book was exciting in the beginning. I had known many of the cops who were cited in the book. However, the author seemed to inject his personal ego and ""supercop"" status from the middle chapters until the end. This was evident with the letter written by the case ADA who stated somewhat that he was writing the letter at the request of the author."
3,"Works OK, but bit slippage can be a problem","Cuts a good, clean hole with countersink, but it can be a problem keeping the bit from slipping within the outer sleeve. If you have to undo the setscrew to move the pilot bit in or out make sure you tighten it very well, and check it frequently since it has a tendency to loosen which, at best, means a short pilot hole and, at worst, not much of a hole at all. That's typical of most things using a single setscrew but these seemed a little sensitive to tightening torque. (Grinding a flat on the drill shank would probably solve the issue and might be worth the effort if you have a lot of holes to drill.)"
2,Inherent design flaw makes these not what they should be.,This set is so close to being exactly what I needed. The problem is that they put the set screw that holds the inner drill bit push the bit towards the open end of the outer bit instead of the closed end. When I tightened the set screw it pushed the inner bit out of alignment and it was unusable. This only happened to one bit in the set but it was the bit I use most often. I had to return them and find another set. If they could just redesign to push the inner bit towards the closed end it would not be a problem. I would not recommend this set.
2,Barely adequate,"Set screw won't stay set, and several of the bits snapped. Okay if you're just a hobby woodworker, but not for the professional. I bought them because they were cheaper than DeWalt, which made them worth a try, but I won't buy them again."
2,Not sharp,Straight out of the package I have had to sharpen the drill bits. The #8 would not do anything but sit there.
2,Disappointing chip removal,These countersinks will create a hole and a countersink with difficult. They are quite ineffective at removing waste so your drill needs to back in and out constantly to avoid jamming and burning.
5,solo classic from a jazz genius,"This is some wonderful music.Piano as a full orchestra.Melody as rhythm. Rhythm as melody.Time and space that shatter and bend...in the same moment.The soul of an artistic genius wrenched out by terrifying forces and put into sound, nervous and firm, ambiguous and precise, ugly and beautiful.Great music from the inimitable Cecil Taylor."
3,pretty good,"As far as I know, this is his first album. I've been wanting to get it for a few years by now. Amazon gave me a cracked case though."
3,"Great help, but not completely what I wanted","This was bought in anticipation of a trip to Athens, Greece, and while it contains a lot of good information, it is not all I hoped."
3,"Oracle DBA book, but not 9I","I do read a lot of books from Don and other fellows. If we'll talk about minor mistakes and minor details, that will be waste of time. No one expected very serious book like One-on-One or similar. If you're new in Admin, that book is very good. If you don't know UNIX and want to care Oracle on it, than that book is very helphful. And if you're looking for ""New Features"" of 9I on UNIX - some utilities, or different outputs and results ( for example even Oracle is not tells about that export/import are working now is very different if compare from 7 to 9I, not just features only ), than this book is not for you (it is print of UNIX scripts, article about StatsPack - looks like from his other book, and UNIX lessons ).I will recommend this book only to junior-middle level people."
2,9i ???.....Misleading title !!!,"Where's the 9i??? With this book having a copyright of 2002, I would've thought that the material would be more up to date. Most of the material is 8i and even 8. If you are hoping to gain insight into 9i and UNIX...don't waste your money on this book!!!!"
3,9i unix administration,"I'm new on oracle unix administration and this was the book i wanted. Simple, clear and usefull for my job. Not indicated for senior administrators.Thanks"
2,Quite Disapointed,"I expected that this book would tell me how to do routine db administration on Unix, in addition to other features. However, I was quite disappointed that it even didn't touch on how to create a oracle database manually on unix."
3,Struck by lightning! Or was he?,"Deadly Impulseby Olga BicosBook Reviewer: Pamela Ackerson (author--Home of the Braves trilogy)Struck by lightning! Or was he? Ms Bicos has written an awesome story of suspense and intrigue. Romantic suspense is not one of my particular choices of a good read. But after reading the back cover it intrigued me enough to open the book and try it out. It was worth it. The book was a page turner. For a bit there in the middle it slowed down, rehashing the plot but once the ""reminders"" were given to the reader it zoomed again. Good book to curl up and read on a stormy evening with thunder as the background music."
2,Mediocre and predictable,"I was a big fan of Olga Bicos' earlier books, and so I had no qualms in purchasing this one. Big mistake. This book embodies almost all of the flaws of the romnatic suspense genre: the gorgeous, vulnerable heroine (who doesn't realize how beautiful she is), the sexy, disheveled hero (yet with a touching vulnerability), an Adorable Kid, a bitchy, hungry social climber (you can just see the target on her back), and a soooooo predictable secondary love interest pair. Pfaugh. I kept thinking she'd make it fresh in some way, but no - you see every plot twist (more like a mild shimmy) telegraphed way in advance, and the whole book is one big ""if only I could tell him/her"" that artifically separate the hero and heroine.I'm sorry I wasted my time on this book."
2,"OK, but too long!","I should have read the reviews before reading the book. It was an OK read, but about 100 pages too long! I do not recommend this book, and probably won't read others by the same author."
3,"Grest mount, bad manual","After 2 days of fixing my wall and re-drywalling where I had to cut out for the mount, everything looks great. Mount is sturdy and holds my 46"" Samsung at the perfect level. 1 thing i did notice is after 2-3 days of being mounted the till went off the y axis a bit and I need to re level the TV on te vertical. Anyone have that issue and are there 2 screws on the tilt adjutment on the muddle of the bracked, one on the top and one on the bottom that do not have nuts? Mount adjusts good and cables hide good. Instructions really suck, I had to do some improvision but once this is done the only way this is coming down is if the wall comes down with it."
5,It's Awesome,"To the guy who gave it 1 star... you forgot to do your homework before buying a $300 wall mount. Thats on you, not the mount. 16"" studs are standard, and you can always cut out some sheetrock and make a brace.There is a slider and slotted bolt holes so you can center the tv about 6-10 inches off the center of the studs.After I mounted it, I fully extended it and hung my body weight from it (175 lb) before attaching the TV with no problems.Cable management could be better."
5,This Mount Rocks!,"This mount is exactly what i would expect from Omnimount. Great Quality, Solid. No worries hanging my new 52"" Sony from it. Safe , stable, worth the money."
3,Not as good as other Dingo products,"These bones caught my eye as something I thought my dogs would like. They enjoy other Dingo bones products and the price was right for these bones. Unfortunately, they are not up to par with other Dingo bones. I gave a bone to each of my small dogs and they eventually ate them, but I think more out of boredom than because of their flavor. They sat around for a couple of days before they were finished. The remaining bone will probably go to my large dog who isn't as picky and will enjoy the snack."
1,Very unhappy,"The item was shipped without the cables. These cables are proprietary and will double the cost of the item if ordered through Yamaha. I tried to buy them aftermarket, but to no avail. Nowhere in the posting of this item did the seller mention that the cables were not included. The instruction booklet also lists the cables as part of the equipment. Beware of this seller he is dishonest. I emailed him about this problem and he was extremely nasty in his response. I will rethink future purchases using Amazon.com."
1,"Disc One Heaven, Disc Two Too Awful","Like I said, Disc one is magic alla Keyrouz, the Eastern chants beguiling and meditative and deeply spiritual, but the Western Classical items on the second disc are too painful to listen to. At this price, getting the whole set just for the first disc, did not make sense. There are other wonderful single Keyrouz discs already."
3,A better way to own Wizards of Waverly Place....,"I find Wizards deeply entertaining. The whole cast clicks very well and Selena Gomez is just awesome. However, you can get the full seasons of 1 and 2 through iTunes. You can get for $41.79 for season 1 and season 2 each. Then you can watch it on your computer, your iPod Classic, your iPod Touch, your iPhone, or connect your iPod up to your tv and watch it there. However, this product is a great alternative for those who don't have and iPod or iTunes."
4,A great dvd,My kids really enjoy this dvd. It's family fun and clean entertainment. It's nice to have in our dvd library.
1,Collectible,If this toys was advertised as a collectible It might have been what I expected. First of all it is rated above in fine print ages 7 and up when the box says 8 and up. Second of all I was looking for something my son could play with his tonka trucks. toy was NOT it. This toy is something that my husband and twelve year old thought was cool enough to put on the shelf and leave in the box. How fun is that? Amazon.com should relay demensions in thier online catalog or supply a phone number to have questions answered before a purchase is made. I was disappointed enough to eat the shipping costs and return the item to my local toys r us so I could by the mighty Crane by tonka for my sons sandbox adventures in time for his birthday.
3,"Not great, only ok","Lord Renwick was blinded in a hunting accident in India, and retires to his country estate, where Eustacia signs on as his secretary to help him write his memoirs, of course they fall in love. She teaches him to adjust to his blindness. There is some awkward humor, especially with his pet tiger which acts like a seeing-eye dog. Not great, but not terrible. The quality of the writing is average for a romance with a light-hearted tone."
4,A great read,"I really enjoyed reading this book, especially due to the fact that the hero was not the perfect physical specimen that appears in so many regencies. The way Sahib(the tiger) bring together two people who each believe they are unworthy of the other is truly touching. I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,Great Reading!,"Jeanne Savery did a great job using a large white tiger as cupid. You start out growing to like Jason, Lord Renwick, and end up rooting for love between two unlikely lovers. Sahib, the tiger, knew best when he brought Jason and Eustacia together. This one comes highly recommended."
3,Hippie Buddhism....,....and thats no criticism. A potpourii of tibetan flavors: starting with a deep split vocal cord tibetan prayer which extends beyond imaginable pulmonary capacity. That blends into eastern chanting. Then a backdrop of groovy wahwah moog music accompanies this chantric trance mix. Tibetan Calypso? And back to some more prayer before we are joined by some new age feel good chanting. This blue skinned medicine monk music purports to bring inner healing through its encodement of transformation from within the spirit. Well anyway you can feel the effort Goldman has put into this CD and the power of these harmonics. If your into mantra you will enjoy this CD.
2,What else in coming from him?,I do have a great respect for Mr. Goldman but I was expecting much more from this CD. I have other Cds by him. There is a luck of creativity here. There as some tibetan sings singing the Medicine Buddha ten times better then him in this cd.
4,"fast read, interesting memoir",This isn't the most well-written book but it is a fast read and an interesting one. At times it got a little self-serving but that's to be expected in a memoir of this type. I'd definitely recommend for people interested in learning a little more about the types of fraud that can take place on eBay. It's a good cautionary tale.
2,Self Congratulatory Slap on the Hand,"Walton's book is an easy read and, at times, quite humorous. However, the autobiographical tale of his criminal and fraudulent acts of selling fake art on-line is hampered by the young author's incessant blaming of eBay for ""allowing"" him to commit such crimes. Walton's tone is that of the preppy-murderer Robert Chambers who never seems to take responsibility for his crimes and actually blames the victims for allowing the crimes to be commmitted. In Walton's case, the victims are the buyers of his fraudulent art, eBay and the art community at-large. For fans of sociopathic, self-indulgent, unapologetic humor, this book is for you. You can also visit Walton's self-promo site to see him with friends eating cake and celebrating his crimes against the innocent. For all others, save yourself the time and read some art books instead."
1,Why give money to a crook?,"Before you buy this book, ask yourself why you want to help someone make money off of their illegal actions. I went to law school with Ken and his writing this book sickens me and really calls into question whether he has changed from the amoral person that shill bid to the happy computer programmer that the books portrays him as."
5,Required Reading for eBay Buyers and Sellers!,"A great read! I read this in two nights. I could hardly put it down. If you buy or sell on eBay, this is a must-have book.Walton goes into great detail about how he purchased the paintings he sold, prepared tantalizing auction copy, and artificially raised the prices of his auctions. If you are an eBay seller, you could learn from his many legitimate tips on setting up great auctions. If you're an eBay buyer, like me, you'll learn how to not get burned when shopping on eBay. It's a real eye-opener!He also tells a great story and fills in a lot of the gaps that were missing from the news. I remember reading all about this story when it happened and it's fascinating to know what was happening behind the scenes, and what happened after the news stories stopped running."
1,Died with the HO2 Error within 2.5 years.,Died with the HO2 Error within 2.5 years. Yamaha basically says we're out of luck...
2,Error HO2 too!,"As long as it lasted, I was happy about this purchase.This morning I woke up with a HO2 error, and it doesn't seem to work anymore. I bought this DVD player 2.1 years ago. I wish it would have lasted longer.Now I am browsing to see what to buy next. I doubt it will be another Yamaha player, if this affects all the players."
1,HO2 error after 3 years.,"I just googled what the hO2 error means and found two other reviews with the same problem. Wish I had read them before buying, or maybe I was lucky because it died after 3 years of VERY light use and not 2.5? Never again."
4,The boy wonder does it again...,"This CD is definitly one of my favorite top 10 instrumental cd's of all time...now i'm gonna throw pete rock fans for a loop.. I recently heard ""you remind me"" being ripped up lyrically by cl smooth on a promo for cl's new cd ""american me"". Please if anyone has this ""HIT"", please send to me at heatmyser1975@yahoo.com ---- Peace and Blessings..RB3"
5,"LEGENDS LIVES ON,ON,ON &ON",Yo go cop this right now word is bond.P.S. Peace to NY chill 101.9 FM where Jazz lives.
5,Page-Turning Literary Detection!,"Jim Fisher's research on a scam ""literary agent"" who perpetuated fraud on a massive scale is thorough--this case really is stranger than fiction! But what makes the book stand out, in my estimation, is Fisher's style, which is engaging and compelling throughout. I highly recommend this book to aspiring writers; although Fisher's subject is no longer grifting, there are plenty of other folks out there preying on naive would-be authors."
4,Good resource,"I had this book for an undergraduate web-based distance learning course.It provided good explanations, both of the excel function, and what was going on mathematically.Very easy to find information.StatPlus is a good addin. The interactive elements on distributions was also very helpful.Very thorough text for both beginning and intermediate level users of Excel."
1,No Support Whatsoever,"I have to say this book really does an okay job providing ways to use Excel for data analysis. But if you have ANY problems with their Add-Ins not working, the support people will just tell you it's an Excel problem...duh! Buy this book if you trust their Add-Ins will work on your computer. But if you encounter problems that you can't solve via the Microsoft help function, don't expect any help from the support that's promised in the back of the book. They'll just tell you to have your instructor figure it out."
1,Excel updates makes book's old version confusing.,"I purchased this book in October 1999 and received the latest version available.I had a difficult time with this book because I use Excel 97 and the book has a much earlier version. The book leads you step-by-step through various Excel functions, but if you don't have the same version it's very difficult to figure out.I called the help desk and was told that they only assist in loading the software that comes with the book. I was told that if I had questions about the program I would have to e-mail them and they would be forwarded to the right person.Statistics is hard enough without having to go through all the challenges the book and its software currently offer. It has been more trouble to me than it has been worth.I would not recommend buying the book unless you are working with an early version of Excel."
5,Students love it,I use the book for an applied statistics course in the Economics Department at Emory University. Students find the worked examples very easy to follow and the Excel add-ins very easy to use. This text is a great resource for an instructor.
4,The diskette alone is worth the price,"I bought the book for the diskette's XLA that allows you to add statistical routines to all your spreadsheets. The book clearly explains how to apply the routines with brief commentary and examples. It should not be used as the only stat book you use, but as a supplement to apply the principles already learned."
4,Obvious earlier book,"This book is obviously one of Herring's first. It shows the typical lack of character development and choppiness that occurs with first books. There are a number of holes in the story that should have been filled in. Herring's later books show her growth as an author. Having said that, this is still a good story, though a little stilted. You have to wonder how much Herring really knows about lesbians in France and the wine business. Anyway, the characters are appealing and the romance is very erotic. Well worth the read."
3,Romance (some!) in wine country,"Set in Dijon, France, major wine country, this is the story of Nicole (owner of a very successful winery) and Camille, and Nicole’s struggle to survive the behavior of her no-good brother. Nice balance between romance and story, but neither one outstanding.."
5,buy this collection,"if you love the 80's like i do, then this is the collection for you. this is the 2nd in a series of at least 10 that i know of so far. some of the songs you may not remember till you get them in the cd player, but every track is worth having. i think my favorite is disc 8, with songs like nellie the elephant and much more. pick this cd up, you can't go wrong"
5,Dungeon Siege ll,I have played this game before and was happy to find one available at a fair price.
3,Unconventional thriller,"The premise behind this book is very good. Capture a Cuban terrorist who arrives in the US, but make it look like something else. The ""something else"" becomes a hotel robbery that goes bad and the Cuban winds up being taken as a hostage. However, the hotel heist really does go bad and the Cuban escapes, along with ten million dollars in diamonds. Teddy Tedesco, ex-New York cop, must find the terrorist before he releases a deadly air-borne virus at a political convention in New York City.As I said, the premise and the plot are quite good and convoluted. Just when you think you have the whole thing figured out Mr. Patrick throws another monkey wrench into the deal and you're off in another direction. However, I had a hard time finishing this book. Mr.Patrick is a very low-key writer and at times the writing fails to generate the excitement the plot calls for. It's not a bad book, far from it, but it didn't grip me with the same intensity of say a James Lee Burke novel."
3,A decent documentary.,"A decent review of the ATF and the work that the people at Northrop put into their entry, the YF-23. Although I have had a life long interest in aviation, I am not well versed on the YF-23, which is probably due to some degree to the fact that there is still secrecy surrounding parts of the ATF program. This documentary likewise did not seem to reveal anything particularly detailed technically. It spends a fair amount of time on the larger ATF program, and then on the Northrop people involved with the YF-23 and their dedication to the project. The video and images, though, of the YF-23 in flight were very nice to see. For my taste, it would have been better if there were another half hour or so of material to explore more details about the aircraft."
3,Good,Wanted to know more on the technology of the jet. Since its declassified I was thinking it will show some of the secrets that made it different but was lacking.
4,Good Documentary,"A heartbreaking tail that was the beginning of the end for McDonnell Douglas. I was reluctant to purchase this at first since it was a DVD-R, however it was worth it. I gave it four stars because you can see fuzz on the left and right edges on occasions. That said, this is a very good documentary for the aviation enthusiasts."
5,Answers what happened to this aircraft.,I enjoyed the photography and narrative of this film. At least the YF-23 has a documented place in aviation history
4,Great Story,"I've always loved ""fast"", so naturally I love fighter jets. Hearing and seeing the story from this view was really cool. I would recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys seeing how humans accomplish truly great things."
4,Fantastic Information - Wish it was HD,"Content:Absolutely Fantastic. If you are a fighter jet/ aviation fanatic like me, you WILL love this documentary. It is amazing to see how dedicated the men and women working on this secret project were. They accomplished the task of designing and testing the most advanced fighter jet aircraft ever seen. The more it is heartbreaking to see how politics and other factors led to the government to choose the competition.Presentation:Here's the reason it only gets 4 stars out of 5. If you watch this video on anything else but a handheld device or a reduced sized window on a computer you will be disappointed by the resolution and image quality of the video. I really wish it was available in HD.Overall:A fantastic story worth watching/owning in a not up to standard presentation."
2,"Interesting title, poor resource","This book looked a lot more interesting than it turned out to be. It is thin on information and long on PCness. If you are looking for information on women in Anglo-Saxon England, I suggest you look elsewhere"
2,TAC Monkey,The author does not waist words when explaining the various 802.11 features. Extremely dry and boring... Kudos to the person who can read this book and absorb the information. I felt like I was reading an RFC.
2,Boringly academic,"(Don't know what happened to my previous attempt to review this recording, but here goes again...)I am a big fan of Monteverdi's Vespers. Having seen this version extolled in many quarters, I bought it. Boy, was I disappointed! It is undoubtedly well sung and played, but there's no LIFE in the thing! It's a museum piece dusted off for the occasion. I can only wonder what the editorial reviwer had been drinking when he reviewed it. Gardiner in his San Marco version may have bolstered the instrumentation a bit, but his version lives and breathes, like real music. It demonstrates the power and majesty of this extraordinary work and shows it to be worthy to stand alongside the great choral masterpieces of later years. This one falls completely flat. Sorry, Andrew!"
2,Boringly academic,"I have long heard about this recording, the darling of the Seventh-Day Authenticists, and, having heard only excerpts to date, jumped at the chance to buy it at mid-price. Boy, was I disappointed! It's not that it isn't well played and sung, it is. It's just that it's totally lacking in soul or feeling of any kind. It's a museum piece, resurrected for our academic study. Listen instead to Gardiner's brilliant recording in St. Marco's. Gardiner may play fast and loose with the instrumentation, but by gosh the piece LIVES. In Gardiner's hands, the Vespers take their rightful place alongside the great choral masterpieces of the world, the St. Matthew, the B Minor Mass, Messiah, etc. In Parrot's hands, the thing just curls up and goes to sleep - and me with it."
3,A fingerprint in the Howdunit series,"Scene of the Crime has lots of facts about fingerprints and examining possible pieces of evidence at a crime scene. I found the sections about identifying remains and what changes the body goes through after death very interesting. I learned a lot of information that will help me in my writing.On the down side, I did have a hard time focusing on this book. It is very similar to the other books in the Howdunit series, and this is the only reason for a lower rating. However, I do believe that the entire Howdunit Series (I now call it ""The Writer's Bible series"") could not be complete without this book.Scene of the Crime may be similar to other books in the series, but it DOES have a lot of knowledge that the other books missed!"
5,"Full of information, and fun to read!","Lots of good, basic information about how the police handle crime scenes. I learned a lot, and it was also a pleasure to read. I read it in one afternoon. Even if you have an amateur sleuth, this will help you a lot."
1,hideously plagued with errors,"This book sounds authoritative, which is unfortunate. It happens that I am a firearms expert, so I turned to that chapter first. I found so many serious errors there that it calls into question the validity of the material that covers subjects about which I know little. This writer knows next to nothing about firearms. There's no reason to believe that she knows any more about the other subjects upon which she expounds so authoritatively."
3,Funny remixes,This Kraftwerk-single is good. Reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because this Copy Controlled disc don't play in my MP3-player and computer! The 4 mixes (that includes the 7 inch & 12 inch Kling Klang mixes) are very creative and typical Krafty ;-) The music is 5 stars.
2,Exploiting the remix,"Mostly, this is a highly generic mix single with little worth in purchasing for Kratwerk fans. Pretty much everything good on the club-friendly tracks will be on the full length which features this single in it's best incarnation."
2,Returned,"Does not work on small diameter things, like wires.Only works on stuff with a certain size."
4,Get up and running in Gimp quickly,I found this book easy to use to get started using the Gimp. Very clear explanations with complete screen shots will get you producing images in no time.
5,Great step by step ...,"Great book. Highly recommended. Goes into step by step - steps which can actually be followed (Cant say that about many books). The only issue is that this is written fr 2.4, and I am using 2.6, Many things have moved around. Despite that, it proves to be a great reference. Looking forward to the next edition."
4,Don't be intimidated by title.,I found this book to be a very interesting read even though I am not an avid photographer and certainly not an artist or designer. I now understand what can be done with GIMP and have some step-by-step examples to use as a template. GIMP is capable of doing much more than I will ever use but the book is easy to parse in to the topics which interest the reader. Don't be intimidated by the title.
2,Sets you up for a fall,"The concept was very interesting: Damsel in 21st-Century distress. Enter the gallant knight from 700 years in the past. Hope is in dire straights and only a miracle in the form of a tortured but honorable Ronan Macleod can save her and her failing inn.The premise was what drew me in the first place. Unfortunately, the author never made good on her promise of a good love story. Once she introduced the main characters, the author seemed at a loss as to what to do with them. She tries to introduce more elements like a ghost, witches or fairies or however you want to call them, a sinister stalker, etc.Christina Skye seemed unsure of how to pull them all together. In the end, it felt like overkill; too many elements and incapability to pull them all together. It could have been a great story, but it never delivered what it promised. I recommend checking it out at the local library if you really want to read it."
3,Strange but romantic,"Well, I'm not normally a fan of time-travel romances, but this book did have a timeless quality to the romance between Hope and Macleod. It was a bit boring and of course hard to fathom, but for the romantics at heart, it is beautiful."
4,Christmas Knight,Christmas Knight by Christina SkyeHope's mail is from the IRS and she owes much money and is contemplating selling the books in the library and the furnishings of the house. Maybe the gem with the certain aura can be sold to Winston for a lot of money.The storm alerts Rory to come from the cliffs to save her. He is from the past but now trapped in the present time with no way to get back...She wakes in his tower bedroom where he's put his arm around her where she can't get up.They hope that the lure of the ghosts and the abbey as an Inn will help get them an income that others will want to come visit.Gabriel and Jeffrey had rigged the house with ghost sounds....a knight in shining armor and he's there to protect her. With the cat Gideon magic happens.They have language and clothing barriers and are able to communicate with one another through body language... There are other powers that are in control.Fire hot steamy sex scenes add to this book.
2,Ho hum,"At 385 pages (more or less) this book is about 200 pages too long. The premise was great, and it would have been a great light (short) holiday romance. As another reviewer pointed out (V.V. Yaeggy) it seems that Skye couldn't decide what to do with her story once it got going, so she just kept dragging it out. New (and seemingly important) characters are suddenly--and clumsily-- introduced mid-stream. Vague references are made to the ""danger"" MacLeod senses, but readers have seen absolutely no evidence of it. Ghosts and other spirits are suddenly conjured out of nowhere (pardon the pun), seemingly as the only way to resolve the plot, and totally strains the credibility. Hope doesn't believe MacLeod's story of being sent through time, and MacLeod's stoic sense of honor wears thin after the fifteenth scene of he & Hope in a passionate clinch... which is a LOT. Some of the dialog & descriptions in these scenes seems rather overdone, too...."
5,"Love, Love, Love These!","Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months, and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat. I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat! It's great because I didn't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."
1,Terrible! Only good for sample tests!,"This is probably the worst review book I have ever purchased. It is supposed to prepare you to take an exam on the Middle East yet it doesn't even have a chapter on Iraq! The exam covers everything from ancient times through the present day, yet the study guide consists of cursory descriptions of a few countries.It's good to have the sample tests, but you will need real books to prepare for this exam. I recommend The Middle East, A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years by Bernard Lewis and The Contemporary Middle East - a collection of essays by various authors.This exam only has a 41% pass rate. It is very difficult. STUDY HARD!"
5,great american literature,"I thoroughly enjoyed this read. If you're looking for info and direction on how to climb, this is not for you. This book is a personal account of years' experiences from an obsessed climber. It puts you in his mind and gives you the feelings from routes conquered and failed, as well as the entire world that surrounds the life of a climber, including the scrutiny climbers receive, the close-nit bonding of climbers, and the loss of comrades to mistakes made or mere harsh conditions. I loved this book, the insight it offers, and the manner in which it was written. Often as he describes the climbs my hands were sweating, and other times when he tells of friends lost and funerals, I was holding back tears."
3,great climber needs people skills,"This guy is one of the world's best climbers but is very opinionated. Like many in his league, though, he flouts safety. I tired of his arrogance."
5,Kiss or Kill,"Anyone who reads this book will walk away ready to kick some serious ass. I loved every article written in this compilation. Mark Twight has done some serious climbing seriously well. He's got major opinions that match his punk attitude. He is excellent at stirring the reader's emotions, you can feel his energy. His love of music connects the reader, enabling us to relate to him on a poetic level. It is inspiring to read a book that is written so honestly. His world is complicated and sometimes contradicting, but he lives it fully out in the open with a drive and determination that will make the reader look at his/her own life and want to do more."
4,A harsh look to the world of an alpinist,"In compilation of his articles written over a period of 20 years, Twight provides a harsh and bittering look to an extreme alpinist's , a punk's, and a man's world who keeps losing friends, year by year. One can really figure out inner development of Twight, who sought more and more complex, unrepeated routes every year, which have been crowned by 63 hour ascent of Czech Direct on Denali. On his way to alpine perfection, Twight sees experiences near death situations, success, loss of friends, breaking up from intimate ones, the trust amd the alchemy of partnership, dysfunctional family, etc.. As his rage gets calmer, but the passion gets deeper, he shaves more and more of his attitude to alpinism for perfection, just like a samurai who keeps fighting not anymore for war, but the way of the sword and inner peace gained looking for it.The book, which can mean much to any alpinist or a climber, may present an interesting account to read for anyone on armchair."
4,Great economy filters,"We have an odd sized filter in our house, a 30x30x2, and have had difficulty finding decent replacements at a decent price. That is, until we found these. They work better than even premium versions we have used, and only need to be replaced every 2-3 months - which is amazing considering how much dust is in the area constantly. They improve air flow at our HVAC unit, but also filter a tremendous amount of debris."
5,The Perfect Christmas Stocking-Stuffer,"""12 Days of a Feline Christmas"" makes a wonderful stocking-stuffer for all those cat-lovers in your life. And don't forget ""12 Days of a Canine Christmas"" for those with dogs in the family! Happy Holidays!"
4,Fletcher Henderson's Unrecorded Arrangements for Benny Goodm,"An exellent idea! I didn't know that B.G. didn't record alle arrangements provided by Fletcher Henderson, so this was really a surprise. Bob Wilber and the band did a fine piece of work by maybe the result is a little too nice - a little too slick. They didn't catch the sound of the original B.G. orchestra of the middle 30'es. But - OK - they were close and I recommend the CD to all swingfans."
3,good,"I have this cd and i dont listen to it alot. But i love the 6th song, Its called weed freinds and it has the same beat as a old song by magnoila slim that ice mike produced. So i like it for that song alone. The other song are decent."
4,Good fun and great gore effects,"This is the kind of crime movie that Blue Underground and NoShame should be putting out. From the striking and original opening sequence you know this movie is going to please. Early gore effects work by one Rick Baker adds to the fun, as two Cop Killers hit the road in various vehicles. This is a fun low budget movie that genre fans should enjoy. I'm not going to spell out the plot or what happens as I don't want to spoil your enjoyment, but if you like this kinda of thing you will not be disappointed."
3,Mean spirited movie,"this is typical of the early 70's ""roughie"" type of story. the bad guys are creepy and unlikeable and the plot just involves them driving around doing what they want killing when they feel. It was cheaply made in Tucson and would interest you if you have a ""thing"" for Drive-In/Grind house movies of the era"
4,A Timeless Classic,"Bialostok presents information in Raising Readers that provide invaluable information to parents as well as teacher. As an educator and a mother, I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to encourage your child or students to become literature lovers. Bialostok uses language and ideas that are accessible to all."
1,Absolute garbage.,"Save your money and buy a stand alone DVD/HDD recorder (I bought the Pioneer). If you are transferring VHS tapes and there is any noise you will get gaps, there is color noise at the bottom of the screen on all videos captured with this. I got fed up and sold it on eBay. Also unless you have the SSE2 instruction set on your computer (has to do with the processor) the adobe won't run, doesn't tell you that in the specs, another ""Surprise!"" . If you are not a complete computer head, you don't have a snowballs chance of getting satifactory results with this."
1,Must have worked for somebody...,"I purchased this probably 4 years ago, and it was touted as extremely easy to use... it wasn't. Analog conversion was a non starter using a Sony Handycam. I ended up getting it to work with a canon digital camcorder. Painful process. VERRY PAINFUL. Well here we go again 4 years later and I'm trying to do it again. The unit does not recognize the handycam. It doesn't recognize a handycam with Svideo. I figured I would try calling the tech support line... 12 rings then busy signal... maybe a different number now? Go to the company website... they don't even sell these things anymore... If they were sooo good and sooo easy to use, wouldn't they still be selling them?? Do the math people. I spent $190 on mine, and it has been a glossy black turd from day one..."
3,Old Model Old Software No Support,"I wanted a ADS API 557, was directed to a number of vendors and this one in particular sold an old product API 555 and an old software Premiere Elements 2.0. When I complained about the switch, I got zero response. The API does work, but the input connectors and the output connectors are not securely mounted and anyone using this device should not plan on moving the cables once they are connected. Buy extra cables and make the connections to the ADS one time and do not move them. For the same money as this API 555 you can get the 557 with Elements 3.0, but you have to shop carefully to be sure what you are getting. I give the product 3 stars, and Amazon and the vendor 1 star. If you want a better quality all-around, get the Canopus. You will pay more, but in the long term it will still be working when the ADS isn't."
1,Lack of support from ADS,While the product worked relatively well with composite and S-video inouts it never worked with component inputs which was the sole reason I purchased this vs. any of the other products available (such as Dazzle 150).I tried the e-mail support and never got a response in two weeks - even after submitting multiple forms and following up with e-mails and phone calls.This product has since been returned for a full refund.
2,Beware ships with an older version of Premiere Elements,Pyro A/V link does the job but I was disappointed that the package included an older version of Premiere Elements. The current 2.0 version does not ship with this package so the deal is not as good as it sounds.
1,Unacceptable - This should never happen,"I bought this unit at a CompUSA store. I set it up using my XP OS. About half way through capture, the picture color became completely saturated producing a negative image. I called ADS tech support and they said that I would have to send the unit in for a firmware upgrade. The upgrade could not be installed any other way. OK, so I am supposed to buy a product and then immediately send it away for a firmware upgrade?!! No thanks. I am taking this bad boy back. ADS should recall all of their Pyro products that have outdated firmware (mine was from 2004). In addition, for $199 I was expecting a sturdier housing - it was made of plastic (not metal) which made the unit look cheap and not very durable. I would look elsewhere for a DV capture device."
1,"Won't run on Athlon XP processor, despite what the box says","The box says that the software will run on an Athlon XP processor. But this is not true ! The Adobe Premiere 3.0 installer complains that the processor does not support the SSE2 instruction set, and simply refuses to install.So this is useless to me and is going back to Fry's."
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL,"This Hardware came DOA. It did not work with anything that it should have. I try everything that they have written in the manual, it still didnot work. I would would not recomend this product to any of my friend."
4,Great for capturing (Digitizing) from VHS to PC,"I like this product because now I can digitize my VHS or any analogue material to my PC without the need of capture cards. just hook the RCA cables to this unit and output to PC via fire wire cable. The quality is nice but not professional; I still see some grainy picture!I tried the component (RGB) outputs but it did not work, I don't know what was wrong!overall nice product for the simple work I do."
1,VERY DISSAPPOINTED,THESE WERE ORDERED AS A GIFT TO GO WITH A PERIDOT RING. THE COLOR OF THE EARRINGS ARE EMERALD GREEN NOT PERIDOT-GREEN. THE BACKS OF THE EARRINGS NEARLY BROKE OFF TRYING TO TAKE THEM OFF THE CARD - THEY BENT. USED DIFFERENT BACKS FOR FEAR THAT THEY WOULD NOT COME OFF THE EAR OR WOULD BREAK. THE BACKS ARE NOW BENT AND I AM TERRIBLY LEARY THEY ARE GOING TO BREAK OFF.I DESPERATELY WANTED TO GRAB THE GIFT BACK AND RETURN THEM .. BUT THE SITUATION DIDN'T ALLOW FOR THAT.SO SO SO DISAPPOINTING! DISAPPOINTED AMAZON DOES BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.
5,If you're going to Oahu take this book along!,"We purchased this book just before a trip to the islands and I would strongly recommend you do the same thing. This book showed us so many fun places to visit that we would not have otherwise known about. All I can say is, if you're going to Oahu take this book along! You'll be glad you did."
2,Not very helpful,"This book was not very helpful. I bought it for the hikes listed and most required a car to get to the starting point. Also not helpful for the Chinatown portion, didn't mention that nothing really opens until 11am or so."
2,In need of trail maps,"This book looked promising, but we found that it was lacking in visuals to reinforce the trail descriptions. We returned this book and purchased one that contains well-drawn maps."
3,Overview of the Paris symphonies,"Franz Joseph Haydn could be called the father of the symphony. He composed 108 of them in his lifetime. The latter symphonies fall into two groups, the London and Paris symphonies, and refer to where he was residing in when he composed them. This 2-disc set contains all the Paris symphonies, are they are typical of works from this era of classical music; beautifully orchestrated with minimal evocative effects or emotional gusto. The sound quality is great though, along with the recording. For fans of classical music, this is a good buy for under $10."
5,"Definitive Haydn's ""Paris"" Symphonies","These are the finest recordings I have heard of Haydn's ""Paris"" symphonies. Kuijken and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment give vibrant, polished performances which Haydn himself would have rejoiced over. All of these symphonies sound wonderful, replete with warmth and brilliance. Thankfully they lack the lush, excessively warm sound I have heard in critically acclaimed recordings conducted by Bernstein and Karajan. Kuijken's conducting of Haydn is straightforward, without exuberance. The sound quality is absolutely first rate. If you are looking for the finest set of Haydn's ""Paris"" symphonies, available at an attractive price, then you'll surely won't go wrong here."
4,Thank heaven ...,"My daughter purchased this for my birthday last year. Knowing that I admire Haydn, she searched Amazon and took confidence in the all positive reviews. Well, I thank my daughter and the other reviewers -- this is truly a collection to own."
1,"Sadly, this isn't a joke","Brittney Cleary's parents are trying to engineer her as a teen pop star, despite her utter lack of talent, and plain-Jane looks. It's sad, really."
1,The most pointless song I have ever listened to.,"""Why? Why? WHY?"" was all I could think of when I was listening to this song. Basically, ""I.M. Me"" is a twelve-year-old girl crooning about the joys and wonders of IMs with brief interludes of preteen girls giggling about the allure of preteen boys and Abba-style guitars screaming in the background. Ick. Don't buy this thing."
2,Used book,Book was a used book but the binding was in bad shape but it will get the job done so to class it goes
3,Great for a short time,"I am currently on my 3rd OXO SoftWorks Snap Lock Can Opener & finally wisened up to save the satisfaction guarantee that comes with it & the receipt. Sadly, I purchased this one on 12.3.08 & it already needs to be replaced. I really think these work awesome in the beginning but now cannot get the opener to stay on the can even while ""locked"" in place. We have spent such a frustrating amount of time trying to open a can that I'm going to have to really wisen up try a new brand."
2,Snap Lock is a real time waster.,"The snap lock would be nice, if you could manage to keep this can opener on the can, but when it falls off numerous times while opening a can, or it takes 3-4 tries to attach it to a can, it gets very annoying locking and unlocking the can opener. Do yourself a favor and stick to a basic can opener with out the lock feature."
4,She gave her life for her country,Cornelia Fort overcame all the barriers that were put in her way growing up female to be a pilot. Cornelia was flying trainers the day Pearl Harbor was attacked and was luckey to survive/ When the US government allowed women to fly Cornelia was there and gave her life for her country. The story of a short life and a woman who had the courage to live her dreams.
4,More Fire getz thumbs up,"So i tried Capleton for the first time and you got to believe the title. Definately more fire. After listening to it one would think Capleton was robbed when Beenie was DJ of the year.The album has something for everyone, from dancehall to reggae. And to top it all of, the lyrics are concious.A must buy for serious listeners"
5,Great Buy but I also recommend....,both Capleton's album and Lexxus' albums are excellent Lexxus - Mr. Lex also on the VP Records label... Both worth the money !! Also see planet reggae 2000 and Reggae Gold 2000
5,3 Spliffs Salute!,"This Capleton best album in my estimation. The song ""Stand Tall"" is one the greatest reggae tunes ever. When you hear that tune you just can't stand still. ""Love is Coming at You"" is exceptional as well. When I first heard ""Final Assasin"" the single I was like what nonsense is this (predestination?). After a while I just started to love that song (what will be, will be). I love how Burro Banton rides that particular riddim too. Bun Babylon! More Fire, cyah tire! I disagree with Capleton on many issues but he remains one of best raggae artist around."
3,Quit Whining!,"I picked up the paperback version of this book based on the sentiment conveyed on the front cover. Since I had this same sentiment about turning 30, I decided to give this book a read and see if I could relate to anything else in it.I found that the five friends in this book had actually accomplished quite a bit by their 30th birthdays and shouldn't be complaining. However, we are our own worst critics and at some time during our 30's, we start looking back instead of forward. This book taught me to look forward and try to improve my current situation rather than looking back and whining about how good the good old days were.This book is a predictable no-brainer, but it was still fun to read. The references to the 80's were also fun and brought back some memories for me."
4,good read,"You kind of see the ending coming long before it actually does, but you still go along for the ride because it is still well written and you want to see if you were right all along."
1,If you think TV is stupid you won't like this,"Plan B by Tropper is designed for the urban want-to-be-hip but ain't kind of reader; looks like he was shooting for a miniseries instead of a book. The characters are dense, the dialog often insipid attempts at TV-style dialog. Not for readers who like words."
3,"quick, entertaining, no-brainer read","This book is great if you're looking for a quick read, but not if you're looking for a deep, meaningful story. It's perfect for the late 20's/early 30's crowd and you'll definitely get nostalgic when the author lists popular 80s music (who doesn't perk up when they hear the Dexie's Midnight Runner version of 'Come on Eileen'?). However, the Ben and Lindsey storyline is way to idyllic to be be believable. Think ""Less Than Zero"" sans the drugs."
3,St Elmos Fire????,"Not a great book, and not a bad book... Very easy read... Book was very predictbale, and not very realistic... Very similar to the 1980's movie ""St Elmos Fire""... Overall, it is good, simple read, just dont expect anythign special..."
4,Plan B,"Again Jonathon Tropper has left me looking for more books. I've read them all,hope for a new one soon."
4,Like St. Elmo's Fire,"This book had a strong St. Elmo's Fire vibe to it (which is one of my favorite movies). It's about a group of close college friends, dealing with growing up and growing apart now that college is over. They are all thirty or about to turn thirty and are very angsty about it. At times I was rolling my eyes thinking, ""Give me a break - thirty is not THAT big of a deal."" But overall I liked all the characters and the relationships between them."
4,Appetite Satisfied,"Mr. Tropper is a talented writer. I think the premise for this book is a little less than original, but it was well written and fun and I am positive it will be marketed for film rights. The casting should be easy; perhaps a few 80's has beens should be considered for the pure irony. At any rate, 'good going' is in order and I'm glad I spent a few hours with this book."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book based largely on the reviews I read here. I think most of the reviews were a little too generous. The characters are pretty flat and the plot and dialogue seemed contrived. Most of the ""profound"" revelations left me rolling my eyes. Tropper is an author I've heard pretty good things about, so maybe these are just first novel problems. It's not that the writing is BAD, its just teetering on the edge of corny I guess. I expected more. It's a decent premise and I'm powering through the last 80 pages here hoping it reaches a fraction of its potential."
3,A little bit disappointing...,I really loved Jonathon Tropper's Book of Joe and was a little bit disappointed with this effort. It's not a bad book it's just that I was hoping for a bit more.
5,great,i love this cartoon just had to have it looking forward to getting them all. nothing like a back yard in the summer
1,not as advertised,i recently purchased this dvd and season two and when i received them i was upset about them neither dvd is a complete season rather only 5 selected episodes of the particular season for my nephew it wont matter because he loves the show but for me im upset because i sooooooo wanted to give him something special and worth hours of fun but sadly he might get 90 minutes of his beloved phineas and ferb i hope in the future the seller does a better job of checking to be sure the product is as advertised
1,Dissapointed,"Unfortunatelly, the DVD came only in English language, and not with the Spanish Language Option, as the first DVD I bought of Phineas and Ferb.I really don't know why the change in the configuration, but it meant that my son didn't like it."
4,Good recording of the standards,"The Italian madrigals on this CD don't do much for me. I don't know if it's because I don't know most of them, or because I don't care for the male ensemble performing them. I do like the English CD, though. It's a good reference for many standard madrigals found in the Oxford Book of English Madrigals. The pieces using mixed voices have the clear, light sound with impeccable tuning that one would expect with the Hilliard Ensemble. The pieces using all male voices aren't as good to my ear, with the upper voice sounding a bit strident. As noted in other reviews I've written, I'm a big fan of historical pronunciation which is used in this recording. It adds a nice touch and is well done. I wish more early music ensembles would give attention to this oft-ignored but very important facet of performance. Far from turning the music into a museum piece, it actually has the opposite effect by bringing it back to life."
3,Better at Italian than English,"A stilted style and even more stilted attempts at Renaissance-English pronunciation make the English Madrigal disk a terrible disappointment. All emotional content -- the mellow, lumimous melancholy with flashes of fire that characterizes English music at its best -- has been drained in this attempt to kill, skin, and stuff these madrigals in order to present them as museum pieces. The pronunciation problem is particularly galling -- if these songs are going to be made incomprehensible to modern English speakers, where, then, is their cultural home?The Italian pieces are presentable, enjoyable, and sung with delicacy and a fine sense of the artifice of the Italian madrigal. Although this recording can be moving, these pieces are performed more with reverence than with love. These are well worth hearing, but the French ensembles sing these with a bit more feeling. Try, say, Ensemble Clément Janequin."
2,Not the best Bettie Page for sure.,"The bondage queen isn't much on this DVD. Old things but there must be better ones available? The bondage books from the Satellite Publishing Company were better and the ones from Nutrix too. Sometime the good ones will be on DVD, I hope."
3,A Little on the Scary Side,"My boys, 3 years and 20 months, love watching Theodore. However, I think parents should be aware that this video contains a story that might be a little scary for pre-schoolers. The first story has a Bermuda Trianglesque theme, where boats are known to disappear, complete with music that reflects tension and suspense and some talking rocks that my 3 year-old finds particularly disturbing. He insists that we fast-forward through the first story every time we watch the video. I'm not sure why anyone would make frigtening stories/videos geared toward pre-schoolers. Perhaps older children wouldn't mind."
4,A story of Santa Clause,"This is one of the best ""more traditional"" tales available and has a true European flavor. We originally saw it in original language with sub titles and we had hoped for this option with this film but alas, NOT the American release!"
5,Christmas Story 2007 (Joulutarina),"A wonderful and heartwarming family classic that is sure to become a Holiday favorite. Appropriate for all ages, with spectacular scenery and an enchanting musical score. Although produced in Finland, the English dubbing was done with great precision with vocals appropriate for the characters. Highly recommended! DVD was in perfect condition and arrived within a few days."
4,Very Good Story,"I really liked the movie. It's quite dated and you have to get used to it being dubbed in English but after a while, I didn't really notice it. I thought it to be a very plausible beginning for the St. Nick legend. We enjoyed it very much."
3,Good until the ending,"I have no complaints through out the majority of the film. Decent acting and a good story, however when his friend and his family are on the iced over pond and St. Nick goes flying overhead in the sleigh, I was disappointed. There was no lead up during the movie to suggest that he had magical powers. The movie really wasn't long enough to be able to develop this appropriately. You go from St. Nick declaring this will be his last year delivering gifts to him zipping through the skies in a halo of stardust, smiling creepily, and the movie ends. Story has a lot of potential, but the ending needs work."
5,Perfect,Very happy with my selection...arrived in a timely manner. The best Christmas Story depicting Santa Claus. My fam;ily loved it....
3,A good holiday film.,"Not to be confused with ""A Christmas Story"", ""Christmas Story"" is the tale of a young orphan named Nikolas. Since the townsfolk don't really know what to do with the orphaned boy, they decide that each family in the village will house Nikolas for a year. Each Christmas, Nikolas would be moved to a new family.Along the way, the young boy starts carving wooden figures and toys as a thank you to the families he stays with. The local woodworker takes notice, and then the story really takes off.Shot on location in Finland (and the original language of the film is Finnish) the movie has a real North Pole look to it. I knocked the film two stars because I felt it tended to wander at some points. Also, the English dub isn't so good. Worse still: for those of us who enjoy watching a film in its native language, there's no option for Finnish with English subtitles."
5,wonderfully different take on Santa,"I dont usually watch movies with subtitles, but am very glad i gave this movie a chance. What a beautiful story of how St. Nicolas came to be Santa Claus. My family and I really enjoyed this movie, and I hope you do too."
5,Good foreign movie for the family,"We have to admit the dubbing truly wasn't that bad. We were not able to locate this movie in original language with subtitles.The story is super great. The imagination begins to run wild while the movie begins. One tries to figure out what's going to happen to this poor child. The boy's acting, as lead character, is better than one could hope for. His face expressions truly tell the story, along with his actions.We suppose one could say this movie is mostly sad. But the main character adds so much to the movie and story, that there's a true delight and it certainly shines through."
4,STUNNING CINEMATOGRAPHY,"What stands out in Christmas Story is the stunningly beautiful cinematography more than the writing or the acting; although I have to say that the child actor that portrays the young Nikolas does a great job. The scenery especially for the winter shots was beautifully captured and some of the scenes are pure magic. I was touched by the heartwarming story but I was disappointed with the writing. Additionally, I felt that some of the scenes were predictable and repititous. It's a sad story but it's also inspiring as Nikolas overcomes his obstacles and becomes Santa Claus.I found the making of the movie interesting seeing the hardships that everyone in the cast had to endure shooting the outdoor winter scenes in frigid temparatures. It's a Christmas story for the whole family."
5,One of the BEST Christmas Movies EVER!,"This is one of the most touching Christmas stories you will ever watch. Even if you don't like films that have English dubbed in, the film is done so beautifull and you'll get so completely wrapped up in the story that you'll barely notice the dubbing. There isn't another Christmas movie about Santa Claus that I've ever watched, foreign or domestically made (including our own classics like Miracle on 34th Street), that can touch this one. You'll love it so much that you'll be sure to make it an annual Christmas film-watching tradition."
4,Heart warming Christmas film,I loved this movie. It was nice to see something clean for the whole family. That's not easy to come by these days.When young Nicolas moves in with the old man I became worried that his abuse of Nicolas would stop the movie in its tracks. However his kindness and love for the boy really showed how Nicolas was a Saint.The English dub wasn't bad. I didn't find it distracting from the film. However I would have liked to have the option of watching the film in it's original language with Subs.Highly recommended.
4,Not just your average war story,"An incredible story of heroism and accomplishment which happens to be true. The book is very well written and presents troop movements, strategy and the details of battle in a highly readable and enjoyable manner. It proves what the American soldier is capable of in the most adverse circumstances. A very interesting addition to all of the books written about the Normandy invasion."
1,Terrible. F+,"Let me save you some cash, time, and loads of frustration at piss-poor logic.Everything this book has to say can be summed up as: Ideas I don't like + matching outfits = fascism.I couldn't even finish this tripe. Like 90 percent of the ""intellectuals"" (we still call them that even if they have no intellect, right?) who write on Fascism, this guy hasn't a clue.Basically, he knows fascism is something he doesn't like...but beyond that things get hazy...so eventually EVERYTHING he doesn't like becomes some display, premotion, or resurgence of fascism. Yet another bout of ""Fascism is evil. Evil, evil, evil. Got it?"" Tip to all these authors...EVERYONE ALREADY HATES FASCISM. It's been demonized for over half a century.We. Got. The. Hint.Now, how about an honest analysis of it for a change. That way we can see it when it raises it's head in the future."
4,ignore the above,"um, ignore the review above. (nirvana is the name of the compilation silly head). a mighty good cd if you're more an ambient fan (like aphex twin's ""selected ambient works I & II""); nyc drum & bass without the hard edge to it, & a consistent spiritual groove throughout."
4,Solid sound,"I enjoy clarinet jazz and this album is a nice addition to my collection. I'm not overwhelmed by the technical aspects of the play, so that is why I selected on 4 stars. A solid but not great performance (IMO)."
4,Picture is VERY misleading - overpriced for one pack!,This is ridiculous - $10 for ONE booster pack! The picture shows THREE packs. My son spent $10 of money he worked to earn and was VERY disappointed to read the fine print after he opened the pack and could not return it. A booster pack at Walmart or Target is around $[...] for THREE booster packs. Boo Amazon for misleading picture!!!!
1,Misinformation,"So, as the other review for this item mentioned, this seller, The Gaming Broker, ships only a single booster pack. Now, my issue is with the fact that in the Product features, despite the name of the product ""Pokemon Basic American Trading Card Game Booster Pack"", it states:Product Features* 1999 - Nintendo - Wizards of the Coast* Pokemon Trading Card GameTHIS* 2 - Booster Packs - 11 Additional Games Cards in Each PackTHIS* Total 22 Cards - Out of Production* CollectibleThe features noted with the, THIS, indicate that the product shipped is in fact two boosters, equaling to 22 cards. However, much like the other reviewer, I received just a single booster. Chalk this up to trusting a merchant too much. I will be sure to simply not purchase anything from The Gaming Broker again, and I suggest you do the same.Pokemon Cards are awesome, however a merchant who is incapable of correctly typing the amount of boosters/cards, isn't."
3,Not what is pictured.,"I bought two of these packs because the pictured pack shows a base set pack with the ""1st edition"" mark. The second picture listed shows packs without this ""1st edition"" mark. I only bought two to test and if they were ""1st edition"" cards I would have bought everything in stock.THESE are not first edition cards. They are base set unlimited.The packs did come in mint condition and factory sealed, so no complaints there. No where in the description did it say they were first edition but the picture was very misleading."
4,Good pack bad pulls,This pack should have been really good but after very bad pulls i dont really like it that much lol
3,watch out for battery check!,"The delivery of the product was speedy and efficient, but I was disappointed when I realized the battery on the watch was no good. In fact, I had to replace it in hopes that that is all I need. It's working (for now)..."
4,Nice blend of sacred and secular,"The Gaither Homecoming albums always make me wish I could be there singing with them, so I do the next best thing which is learn the words well and sing along to the top of my lungs! This album has some real toe tappers and some reflective cuts - a good mix for keeping on the player all Christmas season."
4,a good item,I purchased this cassette for my mother whose tape deck ate another of Bill Gaither's tapes. She enjoys this style of music and I was happy to be able to find a cassette for her. She is 91 and does not wish to play cd's. (go figure!) This tape pleased her very much.
2,Disappointed.........,"I bought this CD for one song - Connie ""Funky Little Beat"" thinking that this compilation would have the original 12"" version which was close to 6 minutes long and had the fade in sound at the beginning. I was VERY surprised with SPG Music, the ones who put out the Old School Jams compilation CDs. They are always so true to original versions, original 12"" versions etc. that I thought for sure they would have the original 12"" of ""Funky Little Beat"". Instead they have the same version on here as all the other CD compilations in the world, the version that DOESN'T have the fade in beginning and is only around 5:15 minutes long.So, anyone thinking to buy this for the Connie song DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! If you're buying it for all the other songs, go for it."
5,Taylor's book can change your life dramtically,"As a Napoleon Hill Foundation Certified Instructor, I meet many amazing people. Taylor Tagg is one of the more amazing of the amazing people I have met. His book will dramatically impact your life and, if your life is impacted, the lives of everyone around you will be impacted. You owe it to yourself and them to buy and read the book.Tom2Tall Cunninghamtom2tall.com"
1,Qué horror de traducción,Qué suerte la de quienes pueden leer los libros de Thich Nhan Hanh en inglés. La traducción de este libro es horrenda.
5,Great for teething puppies!,Keeps teething puppies busy and happy while chewing on a natural non messy product! We love it! Our older dog is also happy with the large sweet potato chew by sam's yams.
2,Made in China;(,Why! Why! Is everything made in China?... Who knows what goes into these snacks? I will only purchase items that are made in the USA!!!!!!
1,made in china?,My dog got really sick after he eat these. He has eaten other brands with NO TROUBLE!!As you would think... I would not rec. this product!!
4,Decent product.,"Purchased for my chihuahua who the vet recommended sweet potatoes be incorporated in his diet to promote digestive health. My chihuahua is picky, so... since it was totally good for him, he won't touch them. My greyhound, on the other hand, will eat almost anything. So these did not go to waste, the greyhound ate them up. Good treat, easy to break in smaller pieces for treats."
3,"Not for our pup, I reckon.","As far as I can tell, the quality of this product is good. However, our little Scottie-girl has no interest in them. She ate part of the first one and pushed around the rest of it. Since then, she has had no interest in them, even when it is the only thing at the 'breakfast table' . It just sits there..lonely and unloved.I wanted to incorporate more pumpkin and sweet potato for our little Kaite, since she's undergoing chemo for a couple of nasty tumors. I've found the pumpkin spice canned 'amendment' to be to her liking; but the Bichon Fries missed the mark for us. Katie's appetite is good and I thought she would enjoy chewing these; but, alas, we shall give them to the pups we visit when are pet-sitting."
4,GOOD START FOR THIS SERIES,"This series began well with this book by Jerry Scutts. It is really difficult to cover in one short volume all the aces that flew P-51 with the Eight air Force in WW II, and Scutts tried to give the reader a general view of their tasks and accomplishments. THe appendix at the end is very valuable. Good work."
2,No substance.,"THis book is all about great pictures and great drawnings. But,a s for the text, forget about it... It has no substance, no deepeness, as Scutts tries to talk about every single Fighter Group in the Eighth Air Force, but can't talk effectively about none of them. Also, there are terrible mistakes in the book. I do not reccomend it, except for the photos."
1,It was not what we thought it would be.,We thought this book would deal with being pardoned by the law and the greater one being pardoned by God through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.It was not what we had expected and we returned it for a refund for which we are very thankful
1,What a disappointment!,"If you were a fan of the Voyager TV show, DO NOT, repeat, DO NOT waste your money on this dreadful 90 minute compilation of some episodes. None of my favorite epidsodes were included (no Jesse James/Teddy Roosevelt, no Einstein, no Dickens' England). Worse, someone added the cheesiest special effects for time travel I've ever seen: the screen cuts to what appears to be a some slots from a giant computer and makes stupid noises. This stuff would have ended up on the cutting room floor of ""Planet Nine From Outer Space""! If you enjoyed the TV show, just remember Jon-Erik & Meeno fondly and keep your money in your pocket."
4,I like Meeno Peluce But?,I like Meeno Peluce but this video is TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE!! I haven't seen it yet but anything with Meeno Peluce in it is good! But one star comes off for the OUTRAGEOUSLY AND RIDICULUS HIGH PRICE FOR THIS MOVIE!! SELLER'S PLEASE LOWER YOUR PRICES OR YOUR VIDEOS WILL NOT SELL!! I GUARENTEE IT!! Thanks! Jimmy
3,Should work better at this price.,"I have love all of my Oxo kitchen products, except this trash can. This is one very pricey trash can, so I expect it to be just short of perfect. I've owned this trash can for over a year and haven't had any rust spots like other reviews mentioned. My biggest complaint is that it slides backwards every time you use the foot pedal. If tried putting rubber no-skid mats under it, didn't help. In my last house it annoyed me, but we just moved into a new house and it is scuffing up the wall. So, it is being replaced. 2 other issues with the can - 1. It always looks dirty. Finger prints, dog nose prints and every little drip shows. I contribute this is the brushed steel. 2. You really have to get the bag tight around the top of the liner or it slips out of the mechanism that holds the can in place. I don't like to have to dig the bag out of the can. One more thing, someone mention that the can is a little small, just get a 13 gallon instead of a 10."
3,Not Solid Enough,"I generally love OXO products and am willing to pay more for an excellent quality item. I was very disappointed with the weight of this trash can. It does not stay in place and you also have to really nudge the top for it to stay in the open position. Although it is good looking, the top also squeaks quite a bit and is clunky sounding upon closing despite the ""soft close"" feature. To its credit, the full bags do lift out easily due to the tapered shape, but constantly having to move it back into place due to the light weight base has become irritating. It is also difficult to truly hide the top of the bags from view even though I have tried using different brands. Not terrible, but not the ultimate trash can I had hoped for."
3,Very squeaky out-of-box,"The hinge on this product is all plastic. For a luxury trash receptacle this was a disappointment. Every step created a very loud squeaky noise that eventually drove me insane. Not to mention the product lacks full stability when empty. It wasn't easy, but I was able to squirt a good amount of wd-40 on both sides of the plastic hinge and the loud noise has abated. With that said I feel at this price point the trash should not have such a cheap plastic hinge."
2,"Slides backward, scuffs up the wall!","I have never reviewed a product before, but I am so frustrated with my trash can I just have to send out a warning to others. Every time I use this can, which is dozens of times a day, it slides backwards just slightly, so that eventually I am having to pull it back out from the wall. Over and over and over again. I have to either brace it with some object behind it, which creates a nasty back-of-the-garbage-can dust and debris trap, or just let it clunkily bump and scuff the wall. Kitchen work is tedious enough without this little particularly irritating bit of poor engineering. I would sure love a different garbage can!"
2,Not worth the price,"One reviewer mentioned that rust spots occurred. The same thing happened to us even though it just sits in our kitchen. Also, the foot pedal broke on it after about 10 months. Why bother paying all that money if it's just going to break and look awful? You might as well just get a $15 one from Walmart - it last about the same amount of time. The closing machanism is quiet however and it is easy to remove bags from the can."
3,rust spots,"I've had this trash can for a year. Mechanically it's a charm but this stainless steel trash can has developed tiny rust spots all over it, which ruins its appearance. It has never been damp or outside. It just sits in a corner of our kitchen."
3,slides around,"We like the look of the OXO Good Grips trash can but have noticed that because of using the front pedal, it slides around the kitchen. We have bought the non slip material that is used under a area rug but to no avail."
4,nice trash can but no thought with label,The can is great but the label (placed dead center in the front) was impossible to remove.Had to eventually use gasoline to get the glue residue off after about an hour's work
3,Poor quality for the price,"We bought this trash can in 2005 and loved it initially. It looked good, I liked having a liner that could be lifted out and cleaned, and it opened and closed smoothly. After about 2 years, it no longer opened and closed smoothly, then the foot pedal didn't work at all, and now the lid won't close at all. Given the cost of over $100, I would expect it to last for longer than 4 years. I've needed to replace if for over a year, but having put so much money in a trash can I've been trying to convince myself that one that is permanently open is a good thing. Well, it was worth a try. So bottomline, it's great for a year or two, but it relatively quickly starts to fall apart."
1,Poor Quality Plastic Piece will Break,"I purchased this 3 years ago and it broke about two years ago. I've been using it without a lid for too long now and so am shopping for a new one. You'll note the lid is attached by a plastic piece to the base. That piece will break, just how soon. Also the lifting mechanism often comes off track and you have to put it back together. I rate this one star for the poor quality for that plastic piece. An expensive trash can should last more than a year or two. Now it goes to a dump somewhere to biodegrade in a few hundred thousand years. Might actually use it for recycling bin in garage for a while."
2,Silent lid quickly broke,"For the first two weeks that I had this product I thought it was terrific. The lid was silent when it came down which is the reason I bought it. I then noticed two tiny rubber plugs on the floor. I tried to find out where they came from, but I couldn't find it on the basket. They were probably the item that kept the lid silent. It now makes the same steel noise that the other less expensive baskets now make. I am disappointed. I did not send it back as I lost threw away the original box, needed a waste basket and it would have cost a lot to ship it back. Would not recommend due to this poor quality control"
3,"Nice trampoline, lousy DVD","The trampoline itself is pretty nice, the DVD was awful! You could not understand anything on it. What a shame, it certainly would have enhanced this product."
3,Could have held up better,"We have had this trampoline for a few months now. We bought it for my hefty five year old son who has autism. We took the bar off right away because we found that it just got in the way of fun jumping. The biggest problem with this trampoline is that the loops that hold the springs/gear are not sewn as securely as the appear to be. They keep popping off. Once one loop pops off, the tension is weakened and others start to pop off. To reattach the springs, I use the shaft of a screwdriver (there is no way you could do this with your bare fingers) to leverage the springs onto their metal holders. The other problem that we had with this trampoline is that my son liked to peel away strips of the thin blue vinyl covering. This is just cosmetic though and I have patched it all up with blue electrical tape. Overall, this is a really fun, stable product (six legs) but I think I will try a different brand next time to see if the quality is any better."
2,Great price but bad video,"I did a lot of price comparison and this trampoline was by far the best one with a handle for the best price!!! What I didn't like was that the DVD that comes with it does not use the handle at all. In fact, the woman doesn't even have hers attached! I could have figured out all of the different ways to jump around on my own. What I wanted to learn was different ways to incorporate the balance bar. Oh well, now I just have to order a seperate DVD from someone else."
3,Okay,"Alright but the shape was a little off, the corners that go inward near the top of the keystone were strangely curved instead of the sharp corners they should have had."
4,good summation,"This book is a quick read, but it nicely sums up the key points in the Buddha's life, and puts a few of the teachings into the biographical context, too. Niwano is himself a Buddhist, so the text is generally free from the usual misinterpretations often found in Buddha-bios written by mainstream non-Buddhist academics. However, he's aware of viewpoints from outside his own tradition, too, and takes care to point out some of the differences. Occasionally, the author mentions multiple tellings of the same story and their variations (for example, he points out that some traditions say Siddhartha meditated for 14 days during his last sitting before the awakening, where others say 21 days and some seven weeks."
4,Melody from the heart of jazz,"This CD is a must have for your collection, spanning the early days of jazz, from the 20s and on to Charlie Parker's era. The amazing thing is he did it all on an 85 yr old C melody sax. His expertise was not slowed by it at all and the old horn has some unique tonal flavor not found elswhere.This is definitely a collectors item."
3,Nice Case - Does not fit some aftermarket headphones/mini jacks!!,"Some phones and mini connectors don't fit in the allocated opening. My car has an electronics store 1/8"" mini plug. Generic. It won't plug all the way into the socket, leaving me with only the right channel. Also, of note, Sony MD 7506 phones will not fit all the way in either. I had to hack the opening a bit to make it fit. Other than that, the case is nice. Sometimes hard to open on th 60 gig video. I slid my fingernail under the edge back and forth until one side popped open. It was akward, and took some trying to get it open. Seems tough, and looks great."
2,Not impressed.,"I'm not all that pleased with this product; yes, it's sturdy but the ""thin film"" that protects the click wheel is actually a cheezy little plastic baggie that slips over the iPod before you put it in the case; mine tore after the third time I took the case off and it just looked dorky. The snap-on bottom is difficult to get on and off as well- I have to poke at the prongs with a ball-point pen to get them to release, which is just plain annoying. I'll look for a more user-friendly case next time."
5,Valuable Case,"If you're looking for a case that protects your Ipod without scratching it, this is the one.Great protection for the click wheel with a transparent film included.Great access for the control/itrip/ or theCable connector.And a Great Price. It's just Fine...You have to know that this is not a sportsuitcase."
3,DON'T use w/your iPod photo,"This is a great case, but whatever you do, do NOT put your iPod photo into it because you will not be able to get it out.Even though it seems as though it may fit, the amount of space between the case, the protective jacket that the case comes with, and your iPod is so small that you run a high risk of it getting stuck, like mine is now.I went to the apple store's Genius Bar and they couldn't get it out; I called Contour for their suggestions and they were no help; and all the while dirt has been collecting inside the case adding scrathes to the surface of my iPod, along with the other scratches that have been created trying to get it out!I absolutely love the case and wish they made this design for the iPod Photo--which is why I refuse to crack it open like everyone keeps telling me--but for the sake of your sanity (and your iPod), don't buy it for the Photo!"
3,Decent D&B,This is a decent Jungle cd. Nothing really slams but there isa a good bit of originality. 1.8.7.'s Quality rolls is a better cd in my opinion.
4,Pretty Good Book,I am a new owner of Gerbils and this is the first book I got to get more information on the adorable little animal. It's a pretty good book with lot of great information and pictures.
3,Mostly Judo,"This book teaches you most of the Judo throws,but it is missing 24 throws. Besides that its got all the choke holds and arm holds but missing 6 katas."
1,Doesn't fit all R series Camera's,It doesn't fit my R742 digital camera and its suppose to fit all R series or so it claimed. And now it makes for a poor paperweight as well.
5,Very elegant,You can't getter a better wine glass for the price. These glasses look very elegant and are better than what I expected.
4,Awesome,"These are wine glasses.Fill them up, drink till empty, repeat.They don't leak and they look great."
3,Germany/Austria,These stems clearly state that they are made in Germany... Isn't Riedel made in Austria? (Spiegelau stems are German.)
3,legal rights the guide for deaf and hard of hearing people.,"[...]The product arrived in good time. For a used item it was in good condition. Readable, no personal markings on it. It was a stamped library discard book The front cover was lamenated for whatever reason."
4,Toda la magia de Mozart,"A pesar de no interesarle la musica religiosa, los encargos del su jefe, el Arzobispo, fueron llevados a cabo por Mozart desplegando asi toda su magia. La facilidad con la que las notas surgen demuestra la facilidad de Amadeus para componer, aun en este ambito tan especial de la musica. Dos cd's a este precio son motivos mas que suficientes para tenerlos en la coleccion. Indispensable."
3,Mozart,"I meant to give this recording 2 stars not 3, but am unable to change the rating.There were glitches in the recording. There were gaps and missing notes. I know, I had the musical score. I was Not happy about that. I bought the download and it recorded very quiet. I had to turn the volume up much too high to hear it. The download did not record at a normal volume, then the next CD in the changer would blast me when it started playing."
2,It's no black mask,"Lady Black Mask..huh..I thought it was Herman Yau's DEADLY DREAM WOMAN...starring Cheung Man with Chingamy Yau & Jackie Cheung as support and a bathrobe wearing Ken Lo as the villain...the film is a strange female vigilante action comedy, saved by some good action by the Yuen Clan...funny but I wasn't aware the film was scheduled for US release...Hmmm Xenon strikes again"
4,Good overview...but not very in depth,The first thing I want to write is that there are about umteen thousand spelling/gramatical errors. I am not some english freak either. They just slap you in the face. Anyways... The information presented is a good intro into the CDMA world. Easy to understand.
1,The description on Amazon has nothing to do with the product!,"The product is listed on Amazon under Toys, and the description states: Manufacturer's recommended age 8-15However, on the box of the product it states - this is not a toy, not intended for children under 14.Amazon says the dimensions are 18.8 x 11.5 x 12.8 inchesThe dimensions of the BOX of the junk we got was about 11x6x6, the product itself was of course smaller than the box, it was 3.5 inches wide.What an outrage!!!If you're looking for a toy for a kid - DON'T BUY! As it reads on the box of the product, this is an adult collectible."
1,Inaccurate Dimensions,"We ordered this for our son for Christmas. The toy was very detailed and seemed well-made, however, it was less than half the size described. Even if we measured the toy in the box, it was still much smaller than the dimensions given. We returned it the next day, Amazon was very accommodating."
1,Bad company and bad products,This product fell apart almost instantly and the company wanted to do nothing about it. Try finding a different brand somewhere else.
4,nice,"This was my first time, it was easy , I'll be using this service again, price was good, and got it faster than I thought I would."
5,Great Book!,"I purchased this book for my son, a college student majoring in music. He loves this book and has been learning and playing a variety of music with the help of this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves jazz or blues or to anyone who wants to learn more about them."
1,Missing Pages- Remainder?,"After using the book for a wk, discovered it was missing 20 pages. Makes me wonder if it was a remainder item or what? Want to return it and hope no more issues"
3,"O-ver-rated (clap, clap, clap-clap-clap)","After decades of listening to jazz and noodling around playing it, I finally bought this book (and the C version). It's a disappointment. Way too much filler (if Steve Sparrow really did develop the original ""Real Book"", that's no justification for including so many of his pieces here) and way too many questionable chord changes.I can't recommend this as the essential ""fake book"". Get this as your second one, but look at alternatives first."
4,Good book for young people,This is a good book for young people interested in jazz and light music. It is good for those playing the saxophone.
5,"The Eb Real Book, Sixth Edition",I HAVE THE REAL BOOK IN CONCERT AND GOT THIS FOR ANYONE THAT PLAYED ALTO IN CASE IT WAS NEEDED ON A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE. IT COMES IN HANDY.
5,A quick nap in half the time,A friend of mine introduced me to this. Listened to this wilst lying down and the nap was enough to refresh us enough to enjoy our first day of holiday after our flight arriving at 6am!
2,save your money,"Although I will preface by saying I am by no means a professional, this lens did produce ""streched"" landscape pictures of my trip to Alaska; however, the problem is the edges of the pictures are blurry. The results were a haze or softening around the edges of the photo which looks like you are using a cheap lens.I purchased the telephoto as well, and saw a very, very small difference in the distance I could zoom.All in all - this is another one of those instances where you get what you pay for."
4,Opteka wide angle lens,I found that this item is worth the money spent for it. The lens fits perfectly into the adapter and operates the way it is supposed to. i am very glad I bought this item.
5,Just Great!,This is perfect for my Fuji S5100. It fits perfectly well to the adapter ring which comes with my S5100. The lens arrived ontime and in perfect condition.
3,Great Light Poor Lamp,"The best thing about this lamp is the light -- it is excellent for reading. The light, which is much different than my overhead incandescent light, seems to minimize eye strain. However, the materials of construction are flimsy and poorly toleranced -- and the shipping price was about 25% of the total cost.Great light, poor lamp."
2,POOR DESIGN,"GREAT LIGHTING FOR READING, BUT VERY POOR DESIGN. FIRST TIME I ASSEMBLED THE PRODUCT WAS WOBLEY. THE PART THAT SCREWS TOGETHER TO THE BASE NEEDS TO BE STRONGER MATERIAL.Bell & Howell Sunlight Lamp, FLOOR LAMP"
4,Bell & Howell Floor Lamp,"The lamp provides exceptional light. This is my second purchase of this same floor lamp (the other is over a year old), as I wanted one upstairs as well. When first assembled, however, the lamp would not work. It would remain on for only a few seconds, only to go off. When we tapped the bulb, it would go on, again for only a few seconds. Ultimately, it stopped working, period. I sent an e-mail to the vendor. I never heard back. My husband ultimately removed the bulb and re-inserted it. It has continued to work since that time, which is a good thing inasmuch as the vendor has never replied."
1,Didn't even work!,"The lamp wouldn't turn on when I pushed the switch. My husband took the bulb out and fiddled with it to get it to turn on, but it only worked once! What a waste of shipping charges!! VERY unhappy!!"
1,Bell & Howell Sunlight Floor Lamp,It was extremely difficult to put together. We ended up having to call our electrician for the connectors were defective. Please check your products before shipping them.
4,bell and Howell Sunlight Floor Lamp,"The lamp is perfect for me. I do hope that it lasts longer than my previous two lamps, which failed to work after about two years.I continue to order Bell and Howell, since I distrust unknown brands, but wish B&H would look into the problem. The lamps do eventually wear out, but that is expected. The problem seems to be within the wiring of the lamp."
2,Sterile floor Lamp,Floor LampDoes not fit our application. Finish reminds one of the doctors office. Finish could be more subtle and go with a greater number of applications.
2,Good Light - Poor Quality Construction,"I bought this lamp about two years ago. The stem keeps coming out of the base. No matter what I do, it just won't stay. Once it fell and shattered the bulb. Trashy construction."
1,I gave up - back to regular floor lamps,"This was my second try to get one of these lamps that would work. The first one I bought stopped working just outside of the warranty. I purchase another, and it was non-fuctioning right out of the box. I give up. I returned it, got a mother/daughter floor lamp to stand beside my desk instead, and it works fine. I miss the bright light of the other lamp, but not the hassle when it wasn't working. Not worth the trouble until they make one to last."
4,Very good service,"The item in question is a very good piece of equipment worth the price paid for . The noted thing is that i order the lamp for Christmas , had but a few days till . The lamp came 3 days after the order .My thanks Amazon for getting the lamp ( Nice lamp worth getting ) to me post haste ."
1,Cheaply made,"As others have said, this is a very poorly made lamp. It broke even as I was trying to assemble it. Now I have to spend time and energy trying to return the thing."
2,Died after five years,"I agree with the person who said great light, poor lamp. It suddenly quit on me the other day. I have lamps from the 40's that are still in great working condition. I have another friend with one of these who also said hers died after just a few short years, so, financially, it's not worth the investment- just buy a conventional lamp and a full spectrum bulb."
3,Great light. poor quality lamp,"From reading other reviews, I think I was lucky. I had one of these lamps for about 5 years and loved it. I used it as a reading lamp next to the couch. Recently. it failed to come one. As others did, I tried replacing the bulb, to no avail. I am not sure what failed, whether it was the switch, the ballast, or I also noticed a fuse on the circuit board in the base (soldered onto the board). Nothing in that lamp looks like it would be easy to replace a part. I am now debating whether to buy another lamp. I would certainly not buy any replacement bulbs, since the bulbs seem to last longer than the lamp."
1,I do not recommend this product,"One of, if not the, flimsiest products I have ever had the misfortune to own. Connection to base - NO GOOD!! Don't waste your $$. However, if you do decide to purchase it the tip to success is this: don't try to feed the excess cord through the bottom at that connection; feed the excess through mid-way."
2,poor design?,"This lamp provided excellent lighting while it worked..which was less than a year. When I tried to get it fixed, I was told by the lamp shop there are no parts available. Who wants to buy a throw away lamp? It also fell apart when you move it up to clean, etc...poor design and performance."
1,"Great light, cheap lamp","Same experience as other reviewers it turns out...The light is amazing. VERY bright and clean color. I love it.When the light went out, I bought another $8 bulb. Turns out it wasn't the bulb.. it was the lamp itself. Had it only about 2-3 years.Can someone please make a quality lamp for this gorgeous bulb??"
3,Need for a Clear Parts List,The Bell and Howell Sunlight Floor Lamp was made difficult to assemble by a missing necessary screw and the absence of any parts list describing the size of the screw. An e-mail inquiry has produced no response from Bell and Howell. --Robert L. Gilliat
3,Transylvania on a daily basis,"A fairly descriptive diary of a journey to many interesting places in Transylvania, a very multicultural section of the world with an exciting history. The journey of the author itself is quite adventurous, and we get a pretty good glimpse of the daily lives of the people who live there. My only problem with the book was that the author often seemed to be prejudiced against Hungarians (or Magyars),in fact at some point she calls the Magyars (as a whole) arrogant psychopaths. There is quite a bit of ethnic tension in Transylvania even today, it would be helpful if someone was able to give an unbiased account of the situation."
1,"Utter ignorance of the history, geography, and culture of Transylvania","I enjoyed some of Dervla Murphy's earlier books. However, this book revealed that Ms. Murphy is utterly and completely ignorant of the history, geography, culture, ethnicity, and historical place of Transylvania. She totally confuses it with the history of Romania. Moreover, she is totally biased and prejudiced against the Hungarians or Magyars/Szekelys to whom Transylvania belonged between 896 AD and 1920, the Versaille Peace Treaty. The Romanian State - Wallachia - was established many centuries after Saint Stephan, the first Roman Catholic king of the Kingdom of Hungary was crowned by Pope Sylvester in 1,000 AD. Transylvania is ancient Hungarian land lost to Romania in 1920. Do your own research!"
3,No longer accurate.,"Although the author tried to present the story of the Bruderhof/Arnoldleut (Arnold People) Hutterites, the information provided is no longer accurate. The whole Arnoldleut world has since been turned upside down and the movement is no longer part of the Hutterian Brethren Church. The book is good for research purposes only. Although well written, the author has not presented the ""other side"" or should I say say ""other sides"" of this very complex story. That will have to be found elsewhere. A good read, but severely dated."
2,not for greyhounds,"After 2 eye infections in 3 months, I was looking for some sort of glasses for the younger of my 2 greyhounds that could be worn in the sun and allow her to stick her head out the car window when going on errands with me. I had tried a pair of human sunglasses that had been ""adapted"" for dogs with predictable results! I was familiar with the doggles brand and liked the look of the k9 optix. However, as I have discovered in purchasing other generic products, they don't always fit the greyhound anatomy. In this instance, the narrow greyhound nose and head. Even with the included extra head strap, it wouldn't stay in place. I ended up purchasing the original doggles and so far so good. She doesn't look as chic as she did in the K9 optix but they seem to stay in place better."
1,Lost in space,This is a reproduction of an old text. There are a lot of mathematical calculations you are expected to understand and be able to interpret. There is almost no guidance in interpretation. It is not as easy as ABC and it is not for beginners.
4,Standard RG6 Cable,This cable seems to be the same cable my cable company uses. It has a dual shield and 18ga core. I redid all the cable in my house with this cable and had no reception problems. I actually gained a couple of db's by eliminating some excess cable.
3,Good quality but wrong sizes,"good quality of the product, but sizes are not as usual. My daughter is a size 13US and I ordered 13.5 and it is approx. 2 sizes smaller than I need!!!"
2,Horrible Re-Make,"The original Search for the Real Mt. Sinai was so much better than this. The entire re-make comes across as a sort of apologetic and really kills the energy and excitement of this remarkable find. So what if you discovered after-the-fact that someone else had been there before? It doesn't negate how awesome your find was or the fact that you were the ones that made it accessible to the world.The good news is that the additional new video is tremendously good. I just wish more time had been spent on developing the discussion of the new video rather than just glossing over it. It seems like the video pandered to some overly sensitive person who wanted to make amends for a bit of creative license in the original. Take my advice, forget this DVD and get the original 'Search for the Real Mt. Sinai' - it made every teenage kid I showed it to (Christian or not) cry themselves into a puddle of tears."
4,Very early Lee Scratch Perry dubs!,"This is, as the headline suggests, really early mixing by the Upsetters. It breathes new life into the bass, keyboards & guitars on every one of these classic tracks.I would actually give this three and a half stars if Amazon would let me so I rounded up.The liner notes are a few paragraphs and it's so old it was recorded on a two track tape recorder so it's like hearing those old Stax & Motown instrumentals. In spots you hear the vocals bleeding through other mics.Otherwise this is a brilliant look at the development of two pioneers in the reggae industry."
2,SureShot,"Lana Wong has done a great job of putting together a remarkable collection of some of the best adolescent photography the world has seen. Not only are the photos an accurate portrayal of the desperate lives thesechildren and thier families lead, but they are full of expression. The MYSA Shootback project has helped these children find talemts they never expected they had, or never had the opportuniy to nurture. Lana Wong has done a beautiful thing for so many people, if you are interested in africa and photography, this book is a must."
1,2004 Volvo XC90 T6 Bosch Water Pump made in China,"Poor quality for a Bosch product. Wasn't aware Bosch had a lesser quality line of products. Guess that explains the low price. Installed the pump, re-assembled the vehicle. Started vehicle, heard a singing noise from under the hood. T'was the new timing belt rubbing against the timing belt cover. Removed cover and discovered the timing belt was trying to walk off the pulleys. Pump was only thing changed besides new pulleys. Installed old pulleys. Again, belt wouldn't stay centered on pulleys.Narrowed it down to be the pump. Bought an OEM Volvo pump ($230.00) and installed. Corrected belt tracking issue. Only visible difference I could see was the Bosch pump pulley has intermittent teeth. Volvo pump does not."
5,A complete kit for only 37 USD,"This kit is great, includes a pair of high quality driving lights, relays, cables and a switch with an internal green led for the lights, I used this kit on my Suzuki Sidekick Bullbar and they fit great... They are big enough and give great visibility at night for on and off road driving."
4,Great for the money,"First thing I thought about when I got my 42 inch lcd was connecting my pc to it.After checking prices I saw that it could get expensive and complicated.I found this on amazon and for 35 bucks what the heck I'll give it a try.Glad I did, the picture not quite in HD but hey, it works. Now streaming movies,and for You Tube, no more crowding around the monitor when you got company.Easy to connect. As far as video. With audio you will need separate components, maybe home theater connected to pc, or just pc speakers.Had to do some adjusting to tv settings, like contrast, brightness, and so on, but it's worth it.You will need to make sure you have both video inputs on tv to work.Your pc will need to be in 1024 768 pixels. When surfing the net text can look a little fuzzy.All in All a neat little box that is inexpensive, and does the job."
4,It works,"Although I was originally reluctant to buy it, I am very satisfied with the converter. It does what it promises, with the only limitation being my TV, not the converter itself. The only criticism is that when I reboot my computer the precise setting is lost, but I can quickly restore it."
4,"Kinda weird when you first start playing with it, but worth it.","I've been fighting with the whole pc to tv thing, but this did the trick. I do recommend it. However, I only ended up using the included VGA to VGA cord. But all in all, it was worth the purchase, because if I ever have a TV that doesn't have a VGA port, I know this will work. Oh, and it only took like 15 minutes to figure it out and get it working."
1,"Shows picture on TV, but terrible flicker....",This product generally does what it's supposed to: it sends the picture from your computer to your TV so you can use it as a monitor. The main problem with it is that the picture is terrible. There is a terrible flicker with even the highest refresh rates on the lowest resolution. I'm sending it back for a return.
4,"Product as advertised, Good value.","It works. Iamge quality is acceptable. However, it took me a little bit time to figure out. The product design is not very ergonomic. VGA INPUT and VGA OUTPUT port look exactly the same. Be aware that the color of the VGA cord, which is inclued in the package, doesn't match. SUPPOSED TO BE BLUE (CORD) TO BLUE (VGA PORT). IN FACT, IT IS BLUE TO BLACK. Plus, for who wants to watch video on TV, your video card setting is crucial, especially the ATI users. This converter shoud work for any kind of video card if you get the right setting. Enjoy your big screen."
1,Not Working,This item is not working for me. I tried to watch the PC movie from my LCD TV; however the image did not show up on my TV at all.
4,Good sound track,"I enjoyed this soundtrack alot. although I there aren't a few tracks from the movie. Here is a list of the ones I've found.""From ruchmore with love"" by Mint Royale. ""Rose Rouge"" by st. Germain. ""Sara smile"" and ""Charle's Prelude"" Don Byron.""black eyed dog"" Nick Drake. The only one I can't fins is that Latin song when Sara and John are in the Elevator at the Waldorf. Happy hunting."
3,"about ""From Rusholme, With Love""","If you enjoyed listening to the Eastern music that Lars was playing, you'll like From Rusholme, With Love by Mint Royale.... but you ALSO may love Pistolero by Juno Reactor on the Once Upon a Time in Mexico Soundtrack because it's virtually the same song with a Mexican twist."
4,fine one,Hy everyone. This is actually a great soudtrack with a lot of diversity. I would have a question : Does anybody know what is the great song that plays at the end of the trailer ?Bye
3,The major track left off,"The soundtrack is good, but the standout track is left off. St. Germain's ""rose rouge"" is used twice in the film, and is the most immediate song in the whole film. I recommend listening to St. Germain's album ""tourist"" if you're interested in hearing more."
3,Missing music,"This ""Music fromm the Miramax Motion Picture, Serendipity"" did not contain all of the songs from the movie. Two tracks, the best two in my opinion, were from some reason eliminated."
3,Anyone Find out that song name?,"I agree with the other reviewers. Pretty good soundtrack, but missing some key songs and interludes. Anyone find out the name of the song when he's reading his obit? Thanks."
3,Help me find this song missing from the soundtrack!,"Unfortunately the second best song from the film is not included on the CD. I'm talking about ""Rose Rouge"" by St. Germain from their ""Tourist"" album. The best song being ""Northern Sky"" by Nick Drake - it's brilliant."
3,Song from Trailer,Hi all. I haven't checked to see if someone else has already writen this but the song I was after that features in the trailer and the web site but not on the Soundtrack is Babylon by David Grey. Hope this helps someone.
3,WHERE IS THE SCORE?!?,"Ok... where is that BEAUTIFUL song that is playing at the end when he is walking and reading his obituary, and sara is putting her friend in the cab? That violin & twinkly sounding song that also plays on the DVD main menu?!? It isnt the 'fast forward song' on the CD.ARG!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a hauntingly beautiful piece of music. Its been in my head all night long. I HATE IT WHEN THEY DO THIS ON MOVIE SOUNDTRACKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Lars' music???,"Hi folks,Loved the movie and the songs, but also loved the Eastern music played by the character ""Lars"" on the shanai instrument. Does anybody out there know where they got the music for his stuff? Thanks!"
5,Eastern Music?,It is great movie with amazing songs. I felt in love with Eastern music Lars played on the shanai instrument. Can anybody help me to find that music.Thanks
3,missing track,"hello there... one track is missing... it's in the trailer :-) david gray ""babylon""... greets, marc"
4,A cute movie/Love John Cusack,Soundtrack is a bit boring but for the most part it's enjoyable. I'm a big fan of John Cusack so my thinking is a bit clouded!
5,Serendipity,"I bought this soundtrack because I have always loved the movie, and I loved all the music that was in the movie, so I knew this would be something I would want in my music collection. Everytime I listen to it, I always have a smile on my face. Very happy that I made the choice to purchase this."
5,One of the best,"This soundtrack is wonderful. The first night I got the soundtrack I listened to it two times. It is a wonderful CD to have on when you have company over or are hosting a dinner party. It reflects the essence of the movie perfectly. A couple of the songs I don't remember from the movie but they fit in nicely on the soundtrack. If you liked the movie, you will definitely love this soundtrack!"
2,not fully mirroring the romantic of this romantic good movie,"I like 'Fast Forward' its type of Mitch & Abby song from 'the Firm' movie but this is more clasic.Hear this last song,,it picture beautifully in the movie when this song played..you have to see the moment."
1,Great songs but BAD RECORDING,"...I bought an Australian pressed copy of this soundtrack and it is the worst recording I have ever heard in my entire life. The songs are absolutely mesmerising but the recording is full of distortion with vocals, artificially loud, bright and harsh !!What a shame for a great soundtrack..."
4,Inspiring,This book really gets you thinking. It's great for writer's block. The exercises really wake up your imagination and make you think outside of the box.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More
2,An Utter Waste of TIme and Money,"I bought this book with great expectations from it, having heard just wonderful things about the author regarding her earlier work. Needless to say, I could not find anything of use in it whatsoever. It was an extremely hard read, besides (like a physics text). The only thing I got out of it was ""alliteration."" I think you should consider buying her earlier book, ""The Craft of Lyric Writing""."
3,Title is misleading,"Pro: Excellent catalog of types of lyrics. Also good coverage of different elements that make hit songs.Con: The title is misleading. The ""40 strategies"" is really no more than a catalog of 40 general types of lyrics, i.e. people get hit songs from: a holiday, a place, a town, a love lost, love gained, etc. Some useful ideas, but I was hoping for something more like writing or brainstorming exercise to open the imagination. This book was not at all useful for me."
4,A quick read,Even though it's a quick read it does contain many helpful and inspiring ideas. I would suggest reading a contrasting book at the same time to help broaden ones writing skills. Read the forward/introduction first to determin what other book would contrast it. Enjoyable reading.
4,Creepily threatening,"This short story was first published in 1920, and is set in Lovecraft's Dream Cycle. It tells the story of the ancient city of Ib, that existed in the land of Mnar, when the world was young, and of it's destruction by the newly arrived humans. But the god of Ib was no longer asleep beneath the lake, and after a thousand years, even the priests of Sarnath have grown lax about the god of Ib. And, on the night of the celebration of one thousand years since the destruction of Ib, the god comes to call.This is a very good book, a real good book of the Dream Cycle. It's creepily threatening, and altogether fascinating. My only wish is that the story had been longer. As part of the Dream Cycle, it's a great read. But, by itself it's just a bit too short. Nonetheless, I do highly recommend it!"
4,Thrilling read.,"H.P lovecraft writes great horror stories and this is no exception he's probably one of the great horror story writers along with the likes of Poe. This book is made up of creative writing and conjours up distorted images in your head from the suspense that builds up to the climax toward the end. H.P Lovecraft's books tend to focus on the Horror/Fantasy genre and is the kind of horror material that involves creatures of a new breed and not so much a typical thriller story for example. The doom that came to sarnath definatley wipes the floor with alot of the modern horror stories that you see around and is an intense, shaded, wonderful, gripping book."
4,A wonderful set of short horror stories from the Master,"These are some of the tales from Lovecraft's early period, when he was still very influenced by the fantasies of Lord Dunsany. The title tale is a neat little story of genocide, vengeance, and a doomed city, replete with eldritch touches."
1,Computer Based Training has come a long way....,"I just bought the Reporting Essentials V8 CBT cd. I have used Microsoft Online Training Kits for SQL Server and Allaire's SkillBuilding. I expect something similar. Not even close. Don't buy this, it is not worth [the price] for only text, no sound or good ""you perform the topic."" Computer Based Training has come a long way, but this is stuck in the 1980's. The installation process is not easy. The training presentations wouldn't work using Explorer 5.5. I had to uninstall it then install 5.0.... Please save your money, don't get this one."
1,mrs,I guess the product is not made anymore. I never got the product and they had to refund my money. They need to take if off the site as if it is for sale.
4,Works well to keep makeup off of phone.,"Had a slight problem with the cover sticker coming off on the outside piece, but in general, it is great to keep the makeup off of the phone."
2,Hard to install and not very durable,"I should have been wearing magnifying glasses when trying to install this on my Razr because the fit has to be PERFECT or you can see bubbles on the edges. I wound up throwing the out the outside skin after my botched installation attempt. The inside skin started picking up junk on the edges after a week or so and so I pulled it off.It IS crystal clear, I'll give it that, but big marks down for installation hassles and lack of durability."
1,Not as strong as described,"The protective covers were flexible, but didn't have enough magnetic pull to stay on the glass that needed protecting. The flimsy paper ""spatula"" that is given with the product to help iron out any air bubbles did not work well, it created more air pockets. The film was easily gummed up and became blurry and fogged. I never got a first use out of it. It was no where near the strength claimed in the description. Honestly, the protective film that comes with the new phone works better... and that's not saying much."
5,Inten screen protector is awesome,"I've got my V3 for more than a year, and just recently I've decided to get it a screen protector. This 2 pieces one is really good, usually what I found in the market are those 1 piece ones. This Insten one comes with a nice package with free cloth so you could clean your screen before applying the screen protector.My phone screen had a tiny scratch from my last drop of the phone, but after I applied the screen protector, it disappeared .. haha what a surprise ..Nice item here .."
4,Tricky but nice,The screen guard is nice it was a little tricky to get it on straight with no bubbles. Now that it is in place I don't even think about it. Good item.
2,WARNING! you get what you pay for except in the outrageous shipping!,"Ok, so i thought, why not, everyone else seemed to be able to use it. IT BITES! the inside cover caught every piece of dust in the air before i sealed it. And the outside cover was THE WRONG SIZE! i had to cut it to fit, it was HUGE! This was not worth it cause of the shipping. They could have stuck it in an envelope it was so small, instead they stick it in a manila envelope and charge u 5 plus for shippingBUYER BEWARE!"
5,screen protector,i wish i had known about these scratch protectors when i first got my razor but i didn't. that's ok because i have them now and it's great!! they help to keep the screen free of make up as well! i received my order quickly...would definetly recommend
1,Better Than I Thought At First! - Problems? Read This!,"I ordered 2 of these just in case, but at first I thought there was a BIG problem! The tab for pulling off the 1st protective layer removes easily, but once you have the cover in place, the tab for holding onto the cover while positioning, won't come off without leaving a sticky & papery residue that won't come off...BUT, I finally realized that there is a 3rd clear layer that comes off with the second tab!! You really can't tell until you pull off the 2nd tab, thinking of throwing the whole thing away, then you realize, that there is a screen cover left in place on your phone! I wish they would tell you these things in the instructions! (But they would probably be in Japanese).It does also say it comes with a plastic squeegy to smooth out air bubbles, but the two I got didn't have one in the package, just the cover and a nice screen cleaning cloth. I Recommend, NOW that I know there are 3 clear layers to the covers! And that they DO work!"
2,Service & Item,The service Was excellent.The item is not so good. To charge the phone I have to take out the shield...
2,useless,"This product is useless, it came with two screen protectors. One for the small outside screen and one when you open the phone. The one for the outside screen is ok, but the one for the larger screen does not stay in place. It was a waste of my money. I would not purchase this again"
2,Weak story and characters,"The premise of this book sounded interesting, so I thought I would give this author a try. It was a huge disappointment. The characters were poorly written, the story was sketchy, and the plot was weak. The idea had a lot of potential, but I just felt the overall book was shallow and subsequently uninteresting. It's a bad sign when you finish a book and feel like you have just wasted a lot of your time. I am not going to be trying another Skye book anytime soon."
4,Another Winner from Skye!,"If you want a well-written, contemporary story that flirts with the past; romantic settings in New York, Scotland & England; interesting, multidemensional, flawed (yet still appealing) characters; a plot with danger, intrigue, passion, humor, paranormal sightings & gifts; and the chance to learn something new (the jewelry-making craft), you should enjoy this book as much as I did. Maggie & Jared were characters worth meeting and getting to know; their mutual attraction sizzles. This is Skye's 7th book in her Draycott Abbey series & can stand alone, but it helps if you've read previous titles in the series (well worth your time). I'm lookng forward to her promised sequels with Faith & Chessa, but I think Skye could have another interesting story with the intriguing Izzy."
1,dead,"I have tried to make thi thing work in three computers. It is never recognized in POST. I don't hear it spin with mechanic's stethoscope. I have been able to get other models (later) to work in those machines. I am certain it is in the hybrid, or ""older"" power coupling as it does not look like later versions of the SATA. I was unable to return as I had a Ultra-ATA/SATA form factor issue until I purchased a IDE-SATA card which took me past the warranty. The new Intel mobo with native SATA for my ""build your own"" and my new Dell don't see it."
2,I know he can do better then this,"Well, I expected more from this guy, I really did. Usually when I take a disc and see Nicholas Payton in it as a leader or as a side man I know that this is a swingie , hot , tasty one, and usuasly I was right. This album on the other hand was a huge dissapointment. If you want to get know Nicholas payton do not it with this one."
5,GREAT COMPOSER WHO SHOULD BE KNOWN!,"Herman ""X"" Clark is one of the three great composers in Jazz today. Miss his music at your loss. Every single arrangement and song he touches is Pure Gold. I hope we can buy new music by him soon."

1,Another Self Help that Fails,"My wife got this as a present and read it, didn;t think mush but I read it about midway to the end , very quickly, and thought ""and so."" This is not even a good primer or 101 on the topic. If you don't have these ""skills"" down before leaving high school, even public high school - you are in deep trouble."
4,Nice muffler,"I know this is a 2 stroke muffler, but I installed this 1 1/8"" universal kit onto a 4 stroke110cc SSR pitbike. I had to trim the stock head pipe a few inches due to the length of this muffler, but it bolted right on after that. The bike is a little quieter than stock, but it sounds good and beefy. Good construction.My only complaint is that the rear mount (supplied in the kit) didnt fit the muffler exactly right. Feels sturdy though.The muffler has a spark arrestor, and IS stamped USFS approved. The whole reason i purchased it."
4,sweet tool,"I needed a faster way to measure up exteriors of houses for re-siding and this is it. Easy to use and understand advanced functions and accuracy is awesome. 4 stars because the laser target peep hole for use in daylight is hard to look through and line up free hand rear of unit, but for the level of accuracy I still get and speed beets a tape measure at least 10 to 1"
2,Too Old,"I have been a huge follower of UFO's since I was a toddler, I am now 67 and hopefully far wiser. However, back to the subject matter at hand. I found this History Channel DVD on UFO's and Aliens to be very dated. In my opinion some of the sightings covered were lame at best, especially so since reading the hightly rated book UFO's: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials go On Record written by Leslie Kean. Had I known before I bought this DVD that some of the material was quite old I wouldn't have bought it. Then again I should have read the cover a little more carefully, as it does say Classics. However, I must point out that their Ancient Aliens series is nothing less than outstanding, and I would recommend it highly to anyone."
5,Fun and relaxing music.,"Many do not think of gypsy music as including traditional European stringed instruments, instead envisioning twangy middle-eastern sounds. Actually, the fluidity of the violin makes for wonderful, flowing, gypsy rythms. My personal favorite sounds of the CD are contained in track two of the CD. Granted, this isn't Wagner, or punk-rock or something, so tracks sometimes lack differentiating features -- at least to my naive ear.I received this CD from Rob Diggins, an artist who recorded for this album, and my violin teacher here in Northern California. Hopefully you'll enjoy."
1,"This is dork rock, not power pop.","I've come across so much junk in my journey to educate myself on the modern power-pop and pop underground movements, I'm wondering if my efforts are worth anything at all.Sugarbomb have been lauded up and down by the All Music Guide and members of Amazon.com, making lists of the best modern power pop. But just because it's modern rock, not bogged down in angst and despair, lacking chugging guitars and double bass pedal dirge, does not make it power pop. This is dork rock at its worst, right down to the tongue-in-cheek white boy rapping.With only one track providing a memorable hook (""Gone""), this was not worth my $.50, and it's no wonder ""Bully"" is in cut-out bins all over America. I must start trusting my better judgement. If the album is laden with Japanese writing and has songs called ""Motor Mouth"" and ""Mail Order Girlfriend,"" don't buy it."
4,great modern day power pop,"I like this cd they have there own sound yet sound like a cross between xtc and queen its that good. The songs are well written and played .The standouts are what a drag ,hello, wating ,and after all if you feel the need for a power pop injection try this band iam sure they wont let you down"
5,Awsome CD !! - HOOKS galore - THE BEATLES of the future ?,"WOW , this cd floored me !!! --- Awsome power poprock , with HOOKS galore in every song , TOP NOTCH songwriting !!! --- Reminds me of a modern day BEATLES !!! --- I cant wait for the next SUGARBOMB cd !!! --- BUY IT , it grows on you , hasnt left my cd player in weeks ."
5,Killer queens,"okay--heard these guys doing a live radio broadcast from MergeFM in Dallas (93.3fm). They warmed up doing a cover of ""Killer Queen"" by Queen; and I almost [...] my pants. These guys rock! I have never heard anyone with the kind of raw talent needed to give props to Freddy Mercury and Brian Maye like this. So I ran out, bought the album--and yes, it hasn't left my CD player for weeks. One of the best efforts of the season. I recommend it highly--especially to any Queen fans out there"
3,Its ok,"If you're looking for patterns that MUST be painted then this is the book for you.If you're looking for patterns that are challenging and improve your skills, then, this might not be for you.The version of the book that I have does not contain a photo gallery."
2,Damaged,"This book also came with damaged. I like the book, the price, and fast turn out, but it is crumple badly."
5,Pokemon Red,"My son loved this book. He's a big fan of Pokemon, but not a big fan of reading, but since it was Pokemon, he read it. And read it. And read it.. For once I had to yell at my son to turn off the light already, and put the book away!. A great book for 2nd graders."
5,wish i read the whole series!,this is a summary of RED's journey as a pokemon trainer. It's an awesome story and I wish i could have read every one of the original books!
2,It was in good condition,This item was not what I expected it to be; I thought it would have been in better for the money that I spent for it.
2,Not very durable,"They don't cost much, so I didn't expect much. But, one of the dolls arrived with her arm unattached - it wouldn't go back on. The other doll's arms fall off easily, though some will go back on."
4,A NICE SET OF DOLLS,"ONCE AGAIN THIS IS A NICE SET OF ""REAL FRIENDS"" DOLLS. YOU GET TWO BLONDE-HAIRED GIRLS, TWO RED-HAIRED GIRLS, AND TWO BROWN-HAIRED GIRLS. (TWO OF EACH HAIR COLOR.) AGAIN MY ONLY ISSUE IS THE WAY THE BROWN HAIRED DOLLS' HAIR STICK ALMOST STRAIGHT UP. WHY IS THAT??? WELL....WHATEVER! ALL OF THE DOLLS ARE CUTE AND HAVE VERY CUTE LITTLE OUTFITS. AND FOR THE PRICE YOU REALLY CAN'T GO WRONG HERE. I SAY GO FOR IT!!!! 4.5 STARS."
2,Thin,I wish I would have ordered a different mug. I am almost afraid to use this because it is thin and feels like the brush hitting on the inside is going to crack it. I will use it until it breaks than get a better mug.
5,Splendid,"If you like Mozart arias but sometimes find the operas a bit laden with receitatives, you really should try his religious music. The Requieum is the most famous, but the Masses are all lovely and this recording is a great example as noted by the reviewer above. It is accompanied with about a dozen splendid Bach chorales. Highly recommended.I'm not about to junk my two channel CDs, but SACD is no trick to entice you into blowing cash on hardware and new recordings. It really does sound good and the better your hardware the more you will notice it."
4,Oregon 88-023,Very good product. We are a landscaper and related lawn maintenance. Bought it for sharpening our numerous lawn mower blades. It was hard to see the length we could sharpen from the description. We needed 8 to 9 inches. We could only do about 6 inches. I had a friend modify it to allow longer sharpening.(Cut and weld) Now all is well. This is not any issue with the product. It is an exceptional grinder.
5,LOVE IT !,This grinder does a great job and fast too.One of the best priced blade sharperners out there.I just wished i had bought it a long time ago. It does alot better job than the bench grinders.
1,A Waste of Money,"The performance of our DVP3140 was spotty right from the beginning. At first we blamed an occasional disc, but over time it has become obvious that this player has ""issues."" Even brand new, flawless discs -- both commercial releases and PC-burned content -- will yield anything from random artifacts to intermittent freeze-ups. In terms of enjoyment, the DVP3140's worth quickly goes right through the floor. I don't plan to buy another Philips product ever again."
5,fantastic!,"I was pleasantly surprised with this DVD player. As I was just replacing my old One Region player, it was as easy as plug the new one in and go. No codes, no programming... I simply plugged the player in and pressed play. I was worried about soundtracks vs. movements, but the voices lined up perfectly with the talking and I honestly could NOT be more happy :) I recommend this one to ANYONE who's a technophobe like me. Hey, if I can hook this up, anyone can."
4,Multi-region is hidden!,"I bought two of these and was disappointed to find they were both Region 1 only...until I did this:1. Make sure there is no disc in the player.2. Turn power off and on again.3. Open the tray.4. On the remote, hit 9879 and then 0. This changes unit to Reion 0, meaning it'll play all regions.5. Hit OK on the remote.A little too early to really review, although it seems to play everything well and has a slim, small footprint that's easy to slip atop other boxes. Remote, for once, has decent-size transport buttons that an old fart like me can see without glasses, a real plus."
1,Can't get it to play Region,Did everything review told me to. Tray open - No disc - pointed remote and hit 9879 then 0 . Nothing happened. It will only play Region 1. PHILIPS DVP3140 - ALL REGION CODEFREE MULTI SYSTEM DVD PLAYER WITH DivX. PLAYS PAL/NTSC DVDS FROM ANY COUNTRY ON NTSC TV. REMOTE INCLUDED.Knitebyrd
4,Easy to use technology,"I have had my codefree DVD player for some time now and use it regularly. It is very easy to hook up and use. The remote is basic and the DVD player doesn't have more than a couple of buttons. That's ok though because I am not looking for a fancy gadget to play my international DVDs. I got a useful tool for a very reasonable price. The only drawback is the disc slot, which sometimes gets stuck and has to be manually nudged. No big deal though, it's a minor inconvenience which occurs once in a while."
3,lousy picture,"Pretty lousy picture compared to my Panasonics.I'm going to find out if Panasonic has a region 2 player. If they do, I'll send this back."
3,So far So Good,"Just received this unit thru Fed Ex, plugged it in and played my new Status Quo, Doin it live, it worked perfect, & I didnt' have to put in any codes for this 2,3,4,& 5 region dvd. It also plays region 1 good also. I ordered & received it within 4 days."
4,Family Friendly Ghost Story,"Orphaned teenager James Greville (John Newman) travels to his Great Uncle's sprawling and rather secluded English countryside manor to spend the holidays with him. After inadvertently over-hearing conversations between manor staff about the restless ghosts of the manor, James decides to explore the manor to see whether or not the rumors about it being haunted are true. His explorations ultimately lead to the discovery a long sealed-off wing that proves to hold haunting secrets about both the Greville Family and the Lodge itself. Ghosts and eerie happenings abound but not to the point that they will be frightening to the younger set."
4,drink a beer and throw this on,"this is my favortie modest mouse cd, first relized they existed when i heard ""float on"" which is a good catchy song but in no way reprasents their music. i quciky bought evertything they put out. they are original good humor, good lyrics though a lot is ridiculus. next to the ""fruit that ate itself"" this is a very short album, but worth it. track three sounds like they just got drunk and played a song. it is very good. the only reason this doesn't get five stars is because the last song isn't as good as the rest and track six is good but too f*cking short... this reveiw sucks but by the album."
2,CRUMMY,TRACK 1: Really boring. (2/5)Track 2: Kind of good. (3/5)Track 3: Stupid. (1/5)Track 4: kind of dumb (2/5)Track 5: best song on the whole album. (3.5/5)track 6: VERY BAD!!!!!!!!!!! (1/5)Track 7: EVEN WORSE (0/5)
4,The greatness continues...,"This EP by Modest Mouse shows just how really good of a band they are! Night on the Sun is a gem along with So Much Beauty in Dirt! Modest Mouse is in my book, one of the greatest bands that walks this planet. Buy this...you will not be disappointed.Enough said."
4,MIB (Most Improved Band),I wish that there was a Most Improved Band award like they have for players in professional sports. Listen to Sad Sappy Sucker as a example of early Modest Mouse and then listen to Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks as their most recent work. There is an amazing improvement in musicianship and songwriting. Modest Mouse continue to assert themselves as one of the top American bands.
4,the icing on the cake on the table at my wake,"Yeah, it's only 35 minutes of leftovers from ""The Moon and Antarctica,"" but a plate of scraps from Isaac Brock's kitchen is still bound to be tastier and more filling than a full spread from, say, Chris Martin or John Mayer.For as much as I love the ""classic"" Modest Mouse sound, I especially like the stripped-down, subdued feel here; it's good for a certain mood. If nothing else, it's worth the price of admission for ""You're the Good Things."" Don't buy this before you get any other MM albums--but do buy it."
3,Three of their best songs,"I love tracks six, seven and eight. They're among my top favorite Modest Mouse songs. But the rest of the album didn't do a darn thing for me. The album is definitely worth buying for the last three tracks, but don't expect much from the rest of it."
2,What happened?,Is it just me or does this sound like an incredibly uninspired collection of songs. Much of its seems sampled from previous stuff or redone with but with less vocal inspiration. I'm a huge MM fan but this CD left me cold.
3,The Worst Modest Mouse CD Ever Recorded,"This has to be the worst modest mouse cd out there. I have seven and this is my least favorite. However, it is still good to have if you're a Modest Mouse fan. But if you've never heard Modest Mouse before I recommend you get The Lonesome Crowded West, then This is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About, and then get The Moon And Antartica. It's not that the songs on this CD are that bad they're just not as good as other songs from their other cd's."
5,Everywhere rocks,this album is modest mouse and issac brock at there best. the sound is awesome as well as the lyrics.
5,Very Good Live CD,"For someone who never put out a live album before, she gets it right the first time. She starts with an excellent well chosen set list of old and new songs. The live versions are pretty faithful to the originals and the new songs are excellent, especially ""Lovers Speak"". No negative criticism here - this is exactly what Joan's fans want her live CD to sound like."
5,Fabulous!,"The shipping of my product was extremely quick, and I received it sooner than expected. This series is absolutely fantastic and a must have!!"
5,Brothers and Sisters - The Complete Second Season,This is one of the best show on the air today. All the cast work sooo well together and have made their role their own. I invite them in every week and love every minute of them.The sad part is their time with me goes by way tooo fast.LOL>>>
4,Great Except for One Episode with Radio Interview Dub,"Great show but I was very disappointed that one of the episodes on I think the last or next to last disc had some random radio interview of the cast members voiced over the episode dialogue. It was three of the main characters discussing the show and you couldn't even hear the dialogue of that episode. I thought I had hit a special feature version but nope, it was just like that. I was rather peeved considering i paid $50 some dollars for the collection."
2,Needed Confirmation,"When I attempted to buy the product earlier, it was not in stock and I was refunded my money. I did not however receive an e-mail about the situation. I was unaware of the fact that the item had not shipped for nearly two weeks before I contacted the seller asking about when I could expect to receive it. They replied to my e-mail with the information that I should have gotten two weeks earlier. I re-ordered the item, and had no problems with that transaction, but wasted two weeks waiting on an item that wasn't even shipped."
4,Great Show,"Brothers & Sisters is one of the best series on television right now. It depicts a close family, but each person is going through some hardships. No matter what is going on in their lives, they can always count on eachother. The show doesn't paint this family to be the perfect family. They show a reality in its characters that almost anyone could relate to. I would give this season 5 stars, but they are charging the same price that they did for season 1 and due to the writer's strike, there is one less disc."
5,EXCELLENT SECOND SEASON,"With great expectations after a brilliant First Season one is often disappointed by the following seasons. Brothers & Sisters Second Season is an exception...all the fun, suspense and emotions remain intact and I can hardly wait for Season Three (which I have already pre-ordered!). My husband and son (24) are also fans."
3,Brian,"Fit nicely in the Humidor I made. Looks very nice and has a low profile. I don't use them or smoke, so I can't comment on how well it works. I just build humidors."
3,Slow Moving,"Soros is an enigma, and you'd expect to know more about this man when you bought this book. Indeed, you would, this book gives you a clear history of this man, from his childhood to his vision to his philantrophic reasons.However, if you buy a book on Soros, you'd probably want to know a lot about what made Soros famous in the first day: The Black Wednesday, in which Soros gambled on the depreciation of British Poundsterling against the Bank of England and won US$1 billion, making his known as ""The Man Who Broke the Bank of England.""Unfortunately, there is only a short chapter on this, even though I would bet people would be more curious on this than Soros's childhood days.The author also speculated that the Queen of England profitted from the loss of the Bank of England, but it sounds more like a rumor because he could not confirm if there was some truth in it.Anyway, this book is still good if you want to know abot Soros, but moves very slowly."
4,An Average Biography About An Exceptional Man,"This is a merely average biography written about a truly exceptional human being.I find it strange that a book about the `Greatest Money Manager of All Time,' contains hardly any deep insight into his investment methodology.A few rather simplistic observations are made however.Most striking is his concept of reflexivity. Many majority investment gurus that I have encountered are characterised by extreme, even delusional confidence in their own opinions. Soros provides a refreshing contrast. He is obsessive about his own fallibility, with a rare ability when needed to suddenly detach himself from prior opinions. He will follow them fanatically as far as they will lead him, and casually dismiss them upon their expiration.The raw personality of Soros is enough to just about earn this four stars. That said, I feel that the subject probably deserved better."
1,Soros was convicted of insider trading in 2002,The life and times of a man convicted of insider trading in Societe Generale stock.
2,The philanthropy of George Soros would have been a more apropos title,The vast majority of this book was about George Soros's philanthropy which wasn't made clear by the title. It wasn't very interesting.
2,Another book on Soros which is not written for investors,"The book is full of historical account of Soros' family, childhood, personal relationships with various people and his philosophy. What is lacking again is a detailed account and analysis of Soros' trading and investment ideas since 1980s. The only in-depth investment coverage since 1980s is a 5 page chapter on ""breaking the Bank of England"", which is a story covered by so many books and articles. I am disappointed at the author's lack of financial depth as being a historian journalist. If one has read the Alchemy of Finance and Soros on Soros, and other biographies on Soros, one will not learn anything insightful here. It is a repetition and a tedious account of Soros' life. Sound harsh? Read yourself. I wish to have a book on Soros by Roger Loweinstein, a financial journalist who will provide much more in-depth financial and investment analysis."
2,Didn't last long,It started out great. Then the step mechanism broke after two months. Not worth the money.
4,Punk at it's peak,"If you like punk, this CD is for you. Totally unbridled, funny, cruel, sad, and most of all completely raw, oh yeah, did I mention loud. Great sound quality, you can almost smell the band (ouch!). I highly recommend this CD!"
1,music reaches a new low,"rarely is there an album that is so distasteful and horrible that one thinks about jamming needles into ones ear. the needle pimps have produced one of those rare gems. Make your own needle pimp like album: turn your distortion all the way up play the drum set as if you want to send it to hell and finnally scream about profanity, and distastful subjects. thats all you need, in no time you'll be a star. this is the type of music used to crack POW's into telling secrets. no one on earth should ever listen to this music. quite possibly the worst album ever made, it is just plain horrible."
2,Lenny owes me money,"Lenny you bugger, you owe me money for the (stuff) when you get back, I'll knock you up to say me hellos"
2,Dissappointment,I owned this book. I got very excited. I was very disappointed. THe Pisonics were so much weaker than magic. THe balance was not there for the two systems. They were also very differnt. That made for stumbling in the game. Loss of fluidity. Hopefully they will revamp it.
3,Just to clarify...,There were two bands called Acumen in the mid-90's. The industrial band called Acumen changed their name to Acumen Nation in 1998 to avoid a conflict. This cd is by the band that kept the name. I have no idea what they sound like. I'm a fan of the Nation. :)Just wanted to clear up any possible confusion.
3,Fun Game,I got this game a while back and I have not played it recently but I love playing it. I was not into the naked women too much but I loved having the ablility to own a magazine company and do photo shoots. I was glad that the only part of the women that was shown were their breasts.
1,Bugs galore!,"This has the potential to be a great game. A nice blend of a business sim and well...the Sims. C'mon, what red-blooded American male hasn't dreamed of being Hef at least once in their life?But it doesn't deliver. Bugs with the models, the AI, graphics...you name it. It's an entomologists dream. Two weeks after going gold there are still no patches for issues the players have been screaming about since day one.Maybe someday I will be able to recommend this title, but certainly not now. Stay away."
2,Snore...,"You are looking for a more titillating Sims with a management component mixed in? Well, look elsewhere...This is one boring game. It tried to steal a lot of ideas from The Sims, but they are all implemented badly. Wanna build a business relationship with a rock star? Just click the ""business conversation"" button often. Creating the magazine itself is boring too. It always happens exactly the same way. Photo shoots are boring pretty much right away. And as far as the sexy content goes... well, it ain't sexy.If I were you, I'd pass on this one."
2,"Can't compare it to the sims, because there IS no comparison","Ok let's face it. This game will mainly appeal to the teen-age crowd, for obvious reasons. But as far as game-play value, Playboy: The Mansion leaves a great deal to be desired.Every ""month"" it's the same thing...host parties, get interviews from celebrities, take cover-shots, ect. It's all very repetative and bland.I'm not the kind of person who quits playing a game after just a few days, but I found myself un-installing it only after a few hours of game-play.For those who say you cannot compare Sims to Playboy: The Mansion, you are correct. Playboy: The Mansion does not even belong in the same leauge as The Sims."
3,A little frustrating,"This game is a lot of fun and is very entertaining. The bugs that plague the game, however, detract from the overall experience. Even after downloading the patch, I found that I had no music playing, the game freezes, people disappear and some items such as the pool floats seem to be caught in a loop. It is still a blast to be HEF though."
2,Sex games review,"After having installed the game I had a fun time for 10 minutes, but then got pretty bored.. after that I checked around and noticed [...] who have the sex games that I think is funny."
1,Useless,This item is way over priced and totally useless. You do not need to even attach this product to your multi tool to use it.Basically you are buying three standard bits and three phillips bits for [about] three dollars each.Gerber should be ashamed.
4,Not so bad...,"I guess I wouldn't give it that bad of a rap, when you buy it at the sale price. I do agree that ($) is a little much to spend on this accessory kit, but it does come in handy for those little jobs. It's not meant to be a replacement for your normal tools, just something to help out in a desperate situation."
4,Nice,The picture isn't very clear. It looks like someone dropped black ink all over the finished product. I guess that's what the artist was going for.
1,Tipped over easily,Had to ship this back right away. It was poorly made and tipped over when you stepped on the foot pedal.
3,Wasn't worth it....,"This CD has some useful insights on openning, however its seems very unprofessionally done. If anyone is into MM, the better investment would be the MM audiobook or some of the online books they carry at lovesystems. Overall this is an over priced product for the information you recieve."
2,Not quite for smaller mp3 players,I thought my Sansa e200 would fit in this since it's only slightly bigger than a Nano and it says that it's for smaller mp3 players. Wrong! Probably good for the classic Nano best.
2,Not very supportive,This cushion is much softer than I needed. It squishes down to a small fraction of an inch thickness. It's not worth the effort to return and so it's going to the Salvation Army or whoever comes around first.
3,only OK,"not really strong enough for the support needed, good color, nice material, the thickness just did not live up to my expectation. arrival was fast, it works OK"
3,Comfortable for the price,I bought this for my office chair as it was very uncomfortable to sit on for long hours. The cushion does help make it more comfortable but i find that the it gets hot so i have to keep flipping it over.A small inconvenience but might be a issue for another.I am not sure how long it will last but assume it can help me for a couple of months maybe a year before i look for another one. I weight about 200lbs. It hasn't dented or deformed with my weight.
3,"Nice price, but already worn out!","I thought I was getting a deal when I purchased this cushion for my father's wheelchair. It was great for about 2 weeks. Now, the cushion has torn at the seam and is almost flat. Even though it did bounce back after use, after awhile it just doesn't want to firm up as well. The seam is what gets me, It should have been more durable than that. The company is very popular, so I was sure I would be getting a superior product."
2,"my mother discarded it, but the cat loves it",This cushion was too thick for my mother. She told me that it made her feel as if she would fall out of the chair. So the cat adopted it as her bed. It is easy to brush shed hair from the removable cover.
1,Disappointment,Bought this for my brother who is in wheelchair. Fell apart after 2 months! Not worth the money! Try another vendor
1,When is 3 inch 1-1/2 inch???,The 3 inch thick is now LESS then 1-1/2 inch. I remeoved it from cover (very cheep)and let set overnight just to get it to 1-1/2 inch. DON'T BUY
2,NO LIFT,WHEN YOU SIT ON THIS CUSHION YOU JUST SINK DOWN TO NOTHING. IT DOES NOT GIVE YOU ANY HEIGHT. SORRY I BOUGHT IT.
2,Hard,Not as soft as I was taken to believe from other reviews.Defiantly feels a lot more like styrofoam than memory foam. Probably a good buy if you are looking for a supportive seat that has some give. Not a good purchase if you are looking for a soft seat to relieve joint discomfort or bursitis--it's too firm.
3,Good for elevating the seat of any chair,"We use this with the Drive lightweight wheelchair and it elevates the seat nicely, so it's easier to stand from a sitting position. It also adds a level of comfort."
2,"Becomes too soft, too soon","I bought this cushion to raise the height of seats while recovering from hip replacement surgery. The cushion is light and easy to carry around. I used it to raise the height of my car seat, in order to comply with the ""hip precautions"" during rehab. The cushion worked well for about 3 or 4 weeks, then became too soft to keep me raised high enough. I am not a heavy person, so that isn't the reason the cushion collapses so easily. The foam is just not dense enough. I certainly would not recommend this cushion to a person who intends to use it on a long-term basis, such as daily use in a wheelchair."
5,Good cushion for my mother's wheelchair,"I bought this for my mother after she complained of pain while sitting in her wheelchair. She was always asking to go back to bed. With this cushion, she is able to sit up for 2 hours!"
3,Wheelchair cushion; did not meet expectations,Could be a bit firmer foam something to offer relief but not compress so easily. Being used by someone who is approximately 160 lbs...I don't think this is the best cushion for pressure sore relief....jell cushion might be better. This cushion already is starting to compress and not bounce back to it's original thickness. Better than nothing for now but I am still looking.
3,"Just ok,","Got this for my father that is in his wheelchair most of the day. At first it was good but in less than a weeks time it has bent out of shape and really has thinned out to the point it really don't give him any more comfort as the first two days, the cover on it has also started to rip and come apart at the seamsI would not recommend this product it you can afford it get a gel cushion instead."
3,Cushion is not comfortable,"I've had a spinal fusion surgery and still suffer from back pain. I bought this to use at school to help when sitting in the classrooms with old wooden desks. The cushion is hard when you first sit on it, and then after a while it flattens out. I was not more comfortable with the cushion as without it. I uderstand this was made for a wheel chair and perhaps it would be better suited for that situation."
3,informative but for older kids,"I bought this for my three going on four year old daughter because she has been asking me about different body parts, particularly about eyes, the heart and bones. She can't seem to get enough about bones. So I checked out a few great books at the library but her interest outlived the month we had the books so I decided to purchase a few. This book had great reviews and I like it, it just is a little too complex and a bit over her head at this age."
3,it lacks . . . a lot,"If you're looking for a biography of Bunny Yeager, this is not it. I would describe this DVD as ""footage of someone looking at the BOOK of the same title--literally flipping the pages and panning the photos within the book--spliced in are some snippets of footage which might have been taken from actual photo shoots but FEEL more like re-enactments"" Bunny mentions all (or nearly all) of the models in the book and one or two sentences about how the models' attitudes and experience level worked for her--like how she discovered them or their physical attributes ""____had blonde hair and crystal blue eyes and a figure perfect for lingerie modeling."" Barely any information is shared of any real substance. I wanted a backstory or grit or more of Bunny's experience as a woman photographer. There was none of that. I teach photography and was looking for something more historical about this genre, I'd appreciate some other recommendations."
3,Hate the case,"The darts are nice, but if you are going to buy this item you will need to buy a better storage case for the darts."
2,The smell,I forgot to look and see if this product was odorless. I don't recall if it was listed in the discription but it does have the strong garlic odor. You need to use a good conditioner to cover up the garlic smell. Other than that the stuff works cause I have less hair in the bottom of the shower.
5,Keeps you coming back,"""Devil in the North Woods"" by Walt Shiel is a real barn burner. I kept trying to put out the fire. Walt's style kept me immersed in the story and fully engaged until way too late each night. I enjoyed the read and the education."
5,Based on modern reports and oral histories of a terrible 1908 wildfire in Michigan,"Devil in the North Woods is a work of historical fiction, based on modern reports and oral histories of a terrible 1908 wildfire in Michigan. Ten-year-old Henry Hardies survived the fire that claimed his mother and three younger sisters; in real life, Hardess told personal stories that his own children have handed down to this day. Devil in the North Woods vividly recreates the terrible blaze from start to finish, the toll it took, and the trials of human beings forced to recover from the devastating losses it inflicted. Though Devil in the North Woods tells the story of man vs. nature, its core is emotional and human-centered."
1,boring movie! Not good for a classroom,I'm sure the presenter knows his stuff but to watch a video of someone just talking is really boring! I ended up returning this movie. No good to show to students learning about laundry.
4,W300i is a mature product,I bought this on a lark. I've had other SE phones and they've been hit and miss. this model is fully developed and works like a champ. Bluetooth integration is strong. Walkman application is great and works nearly seamlessly. I would recommend this product to a friend.One caveat. Be sure to budget for an extra memory card as the 256MB provided will not be enough. The M2 cards are kind of expensive relative to Micro SD but more SE phones will be using so hopefully the prices will continue to trend down.
5,Great Cell Phone,"I had to replace my Motorola Razr and after doing some research decided to go with this phone. Cnet.com rated it well, but like any other phone there were some complaints. I personally love it. So far I have had no issues with it after owning it for five months. I use it as a cell phone and my favorite thing about it is the battery life. It will last for a couple of days with average use. Also I can chop up my mp3s and create my own ring tones. While I don't use it as an mp3 player the sound quality is pretty good on it overall. The orange text behind the black background is great for reading the phone on a sunny day. It is a wonderful phone and I wish I would have discovered Sony phones earlier."
1,Worked for only 18 hours,"I bought this phone based on the reviews here at Amazon, and the fact that it came with a ""Full US Warranty"". The phone itself quit working after only 18 hours. I made a grand total of three calls on it. To make matters worse, the ad here at Amazon is misleading at the very least. The packing documents sent with the phone says that there is no refund and no warranty.Let the buyer beware! Don't trust this phone and don't trust the people selling it to you."
4,Great crunch and flavor,I use both these Chocolate Chocolate chip bars and the Cinnamon Crunch. I keep the chocolate in the refrigerator because the tend to melt in warmer weather but the crunch and the flavor are terrific.
4,"Tastes OK, better tasting flavors available",I ordered this product from amazon attracted by the great prices. The delivery was super fast even with super saver shipping. I got it within 3 working days.The bars themselves are fine. You don't have to force them down your throat but they arn't the best tasting bars from myoplex. Their Choc fudge and Choc Choc chip flavors are 5-star worthy. But the deal is pretty good and I don't regret the purchase.
5,Most delicious nutrition bar EVER,"I use these as a meal replacement instead of lunch. I typically eat one every day, lost almost 30 lbs in 2 months along with the rest of my improved diet...Easy and quick lunch to eat at work. I'm no longer tempted to eat crappy food with my co-workers as these bars actually taste good. Helps to drink some water along with them though..."
2,contains chocolate,"These taste fine, but they unfortunately have chocolate in them and I missed that in the description. They won't work for me, but otherwise they are very good."
4,Not bad,I've many different bars before but this is by far the one I just had to keep myself from eating too much of. Not too sweet nor taste like cardboard. I'm going to get more of these regularly.
2,Hard text book to understand,"In my opinion, this text book should be more interesting for college students to understand. It should have more up to date information."
5,contemporary music,This CD is wonderful and very enjoyable to listen to. I recommend it to all who enjoy contemporary Christian music.
4,you'll get compliments on this ring,"This is a very pretty mass produced amethyst ring in sterling silver. The stones are slightly smaller than the stones in theGarnet Gemstone Ring Sterling Silver Polished Finish Three Stone Bandring, which I also bought. (They're both beautiful.)The purple color is beautiful. I suspect these amethyst stones are lab-created, simply because natural amethysts of this clarity and quality would make the ring much more expensive than it is.I don't care if they are natural or synthetic, the ring is beautiful and I've gotten compliments on it.The ring and stones are well worth the price. The stones are actually more a cross between dark magenta and purple than the photo shows. But they have a gorgeous clarity that intensifies the beautiful color.I would buy this again if I lost mine. I would also buy this as a gift for a cherished loved one or friend."
5,Worried,"I returned the ring for a different size and have not received any message from Gem Avenue. I am worried because I paid for this purchase with a credit card and my money is gone and so is the ring!! What can I do?Sincerely,Julia Johnston"
1,BEWARE! NOT THE REAL ACUMEN,"In case you're wondering, NO, this is not the industrial band, Acumen.This is the hippie bulls*** band that caused the real Acumen to change their name to 'Acumen Nation' some years ago.So, save your hard-earned money or lotto-winnings and avoid this jam-band like the plague.Instead check out the new Acumen Nation album, 'Lord of the Cynics', available here ."
1,Save your money,"A very biased view of the Clinton administration. In light of the disasturous impeachment hearing,the author has shown American his true colors...and its not red, white and blue."
1,Different songs and only one disc,"This is strange...the first time this has happened....new product also. I realized when I received the CD that I didnt care much for the songs and only one disd (s/b 2 discs). I wondered, ""Why did I order this? I must have ordered the wrong CD"" The answer is no, I ordered this CD. I thought well I only paid 5.95 so I gave this CD to my neice who loves country music.I will provide Amazon feedback to determine a correction."
4,You can't imagine,"If you're not a fan of the most twisted,depraved, gut wrenching splatterpunk writings this is not the book for you. If though you live to read the most depraved and twisted stories that only get more revolting to the senses as you read further, you've found your story. Header hits you in the groin and keeps on kicking till you get to the end. This is the perfect backwoods inbred demented writing we've come to expect from Edward Lee, it will not disappoint you!"
2,Okay thing...,"I have to re-solder some wires that came apart soon after arrival--I'd put no strain on the cables. I got one before, though, and it worked great."
1,"Did not work with Stepmania - ""Dance Pad Code"" does not work","I've gone through hell trying everything to get this pad work through the ""axis problem"" in stepmania to no avail. The regular dance pad code (start + select + up) does nothing. I've tried multiple different drivers that other people have had success with (in addition to the drivers that came with the unit) and nothing provides additional options to fix the axis problem.FYI - the axis problem: the arrows are registered as up, down, left, and right by the computer. In a Cartesian coordinate system each direction gets a value of -127 to +127. Upper left would be -127,127 (x,y) - that works fine. But when you do a left-right or up-down combination, you've just nullified your coordinate within that plane and you're at ""0"".TLDR: I put in excessive amounts of effort to get this to work and you can not play Stepmania with this."
4,Good Converter for PS2,"Worked first try, windows 7 drivers did not support force feedback and had to do some searching. Twin PS to PC Converter should show up as your device if you installed the correct drivers for rumble. Short USB cord but awesome price."
5,i like them,they do their job quite allright they work ok with usb extension cords and also they work out of the box with windows 7 and ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 probably all linux distros just guessing
1,Awful,Wasted over an hour trying to install every driver I could find to make this work with a RedOctane dancepad on two different computers but I never got it to work even semi-reasonably. Input was registered only sporadically and Stepmania seemed to register that all the directions were pressed simultaneously when in fact nothing was being pressed. Stay far away.
4,Nice!,"Español:Trabaja bien, se adapta a la mayoria de emuladores sin necesidad de utilizar un programa adicional. muy buen producto!English:Works well, adapts to most emulators without using an additional program. very good product."
2,"Decent, but you'd be better off getting something else","Feels kind of cheap. You have to open the pliers to open the tools, which aren't that great. The only thing I like about it are the scissors, they're very sharp. I can't recommend this tool. You can definitely find better for your money."
3,Building Manager,During the 10 months I have owned the Gerber07563 MP600 Pro I have found it to be a well designed usefull tool.Untill recently.I used the phillips screwdriver to remove a screw and to my astonishment it fractured in my hand wich disapointed me very much because i was led to believe that the tool.Was basically Industructable.Can you please inform me ware I can replace the tool.Thanking you for your quickest response.
5,Highly Recommend this seller,"The book was delivered in a very timely manner, especially seeing as how I ordered it on Friday and it was at my house by Tuesday a.m. The seller also included a personalized letter to me thanking me for my business and extending their customer service. The book was in great condition with minor exceptions of used stickers from past owners, but overall I couldn't be happier and would definitely purchase from this seller again."
1,A waste of time and money!,The review showed the best parts! It is slow and only has a couple of good almost funny parts.Do mot waste your money!
1,If you have absolutely nothing to do...watch this,"What a waste of good talent. Depp tried to carry the movie, butdidn't quite make it and relied on a shower scene to make itinteresting. The rest was boring as hell."
2,the Rum Dairy,"Unfortunately it shows many aspects of the ""paradise"" islands that people vacation at.I found it kind of slow but it's ok to watch."
1,I couldn't give a lower rating than one star,"I rented the video, which worked very well. I did not have any problems with the Amazon video streaming. I also liked how the application's search engine. It was very easy to use and worked well on my TV. The moving couldn't decide what it wanted to be a comedy or a drama. It was neither and, therefore, failed miserably."
4,Tried to incorporate too much o the book...,"OK, I am a big Hunter fan, and used to be a big Depp fan, but this is not the same magic combination you see in Fear and Loathing... The performance is good, but the script follows the trend of trying to but too much of a book into a movie, making it just a bit awkward and disjointed (ala Atlas Shrugged)..."
1,Couldn't Even Finish It,"This is one of the most boring, dragged out, non-entertaining movies I have seen in a while and I adore Johnny Depp. If you can watch it for free on Netflix and you have nothing better to do, watch it. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
4,Nothing to complain about,"I know a lot of people weren't very impressed with this movie, but with Amber Heard and Johnny Depp I don't really see anything to complain about. Good acting, good movie."
1,wasted money,"This movie was a waste of money - dull as dirt - forced myself to watch it thinking it would eventually get better - I was wrong the beginning, middle and end were a waste of money and time."
4,Decent movie,This IWas a decent movie to watch. I always enjoy Johnny Depp as an actor and he didn't disappoint in this film.
5,The Rum Diary,Love this film more each time I watch it! Though it doesn't follow the book exactly; it still has it's esscense and is an opportunity to see and learn about the Puerto Rico of the 60's. Johnny Depp turns in a wonderful performance as Paul Kemp and is joined by an excellent cast who portray their characters just as well. The beautiful scenery adds to the beauty of the film. Am glad to own this dvd.
2,Starts strong. Ends weak.,"I liked how the movie started, and climaxed. But I think it should've been about 20 minutes shorter. The ending sequence of the movie was unnecessary, and added no real value. I felt that the movie had no conclusion."
2,Let the number of reviewers and rating be your guide....average at best,"It obviously depends on your humor, but I found this movie had only a few laughs, most of which were in the previews. It wasn't terribly engaging as the plot unfolded and the ending only confirmed my feeling throughout. Wait for it to come out on cable and then wait until you have literally nothing else to do or watch."
2,Not his best,I bought this because of Johnny Depp and was a bit disappointed in the story and its slow slow moving plot.
2,Fails to live up to expectations.,"Obviously this was supposed to be a Fear and Loathing extension, but this fails to live up remotely to the original. My friend and I ended up loathing the ending of this movie. It was decent the first 80 minutes, but the last 40 minutes were a huge disappointment and let down to say the least."
1,worse than kidney stones,i would rather have spent my night on the toilet trying to excrete stones ... an hour of my life i will never get back ... in fact it was so bad that i felt it was necessary to waste some more time and try to warn someone out of ruining their evening as well
3,Pleasant and better with Johnny Depp,"I wanted to see this movie about P.R. and knew it was based on a story done some years ago. At the end, saw it was based on real life events.Interesting, and the acting was ok.Scenery was good.G. Sweitzer"
3,Movie doesn't know what story to tell.,"""Rum Diary"" is not your typical Depp movie, and the trailers really don't portray it well. Unfortunately, the same can be said for the movie with respect to any kind of story. It's OK to watch as a movie for entertainment; the characters are entertaining enough, the scenery is attractive, and the scenes are reasonably well presented. However, the plot is - to put it kindly - incoherent, occasionally derivative (see: Fiction, Pulp), and doesn't progress to anywhere meaningful. Worth a $2 rental to watch if you don't expect to learn the meaning of life - or anything else, for that matter."
1,Instant Video didn't download,Bought this using Instant Video to watch during my travel - the order said that it was queued to be downloaded but the video didn't download to my pc - even after 3 days. And there's no way to re-download. Hit or miss! Amazon needs to fix - it's easy for them to check if the download actually happened.
1,missed the boat,"Great cast, decent story loosely based on Hunter S. Thompson's life, gorgeous location filled with mystery and intrigue yet it fell so flat. I, honestly, cannot put my finger on it as to why it failed, but I felt the story seemed to fizzle out.DVD extras are nothing to write home about either."
1,Rum Diary,"It has been about three weeks since I watched this and all I can remember about it is that it was bad,and time has proven that it is also very forgetable."
1,So bad!,had long since I last saw a movie so bad.is very poorly managed and is very difficult to re-watch a movie with the same castI'm sorry but I have to say in truth.
2,Waste of TIME!!,"Do not pay for this.... Movie is a BIG waste of my time and money!!!Very little plot, the story had no flow...."
3,LOSES A GOOD CHUNK OF THE AUDIENCE,"Based on a novel by Hunter S. Thompson of the same name which focuses upon a wandering writer wanna be who takes a job for a rag of a newspaper in Puerto Rico during the 1960s. While there are some notable and interesting themes in this tale about getting too old to do your art and lust coming out after you're drunk beyond belief the flow of this tale was incredibly slow. Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Eckhart star. This is probably best suited for people who enjoyed the novel or who were looking for a tale about writers or who want a high brow picture. Note that HST was known for maniacal characters and in his spare time liked to take all types of drugs. He also hated Nixon with a passion and is credited with Gonzo journalism. It is definitely an homage to the author who died in 2005. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING: C minus to C; THEMES/FOCUSES: B minus to B; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday."
2,Depressing and Boring,"I kept watching hoping that the ending would provide some satisfaction, but it didn't. The characters are not appealing in any way - none of them. It is just a depressing movie about alcoholics and criminal behaviour. I kept hoping for something positive to occur, but it didn't. The movie ends with the conclusion being told in text on the screen just before the credits, as if they also found it boring to make and couldn't be bothered to shoot the ending. Very disappointed in this movie."
2,multi millionare depp as a poor but happy idealistic drunk/junkie,this movie tries to be fear and loathing 2 but the problem is that we grew up and no longer buy that romantic loser bs.if you are a teenager or having a drug period and need to feel ok with that than you might enjoy this bordom........
2,Boring and overloaded with usual Left Wing propaganda,"I love Johnny Depp and will watch anything he's in. I was so disappointed that half the movie has constant references to Nixon-Kennedy and what a bad guy Nixon was, and what a saint Kennedy was. . .the usual story-line from Hollywood. But that said, Johnny Depp is good in this but the story is deadly boring. I had to give up on it about half-way through."
1,Could have,"this movie could have definately been better.Not that the actors were poor,but the content was lacking anything and everything to keep your attention.I had to get up and move around several times because I was getting bored about the fact that nothing made sense when all this movie ever contained was a bunch of drunks and nothing else .I rented this movie first before buying,and I'm glad I did,because this is one movie I will never buy. it could have been good to great.But I seen neithe good or great in this movie"
2,disjointed,"theres holes in the story line and chunks missing.i dig HST as much as the next druggy but i'm happy he passed before seeing this movie.when ""Chenault"" was dancing in the club, that guy(stranger) unzipped her dress ""Sanderson"" screemed NO then got booted out of the club but the look on her face wasnt terror, pain or bewilderment she looked 'normal'later, ""kemp"" was outside the gates of ""Sanderson""s house getting her clothes thrown at him, how did he end up there, did she ask him to get her stuff, did ""Sanderson"" dump her for being raped or did he dump her because she willingly had sex with that stranger on the dance floor"
1,Wow,"I don't usually write reviews but I watched this today and couldn't not write something. I rented it from my library so at least I didn't pay any money, just wasted my time.I've held off renting it til now because something about the write-up on the back of the dvd told me I probably wouldn't like it. Today I figured, what the heck; how bad could it be?Wow, is this movie bad! Johnny Depp and Aaron Eckhart must've needed some extra pocket change when they decided to do this movie. The writing's bad through and through and actually manages to make Depp look like a bad actor. At least Eckhart was his usual charming self, even with a terrible script.I kid you not, this is one of the worst movies I've ever wasted my time on!"
2,Disappointing,"After all the good reviews, I thought this movie would be much better than it turned out to be. It almost made me fall asleep with its mundane plot and lack of either any action or solid story line to keep your attention. Not one of JD's better roles, even though you thought he would live this part. Disappointing to say the least."
3,I expected more.,"I think that Depp is an usually an entertaining actor and I think he proves it in this film. But the film lacks an ending. I'm not sure that it's worth the Instant video price of $1.99 that I paid, but oh well. The girl is very pretty, as is the corvette."
4,Rum? Yes please.,I thought it was a pretty decent movie. Although the story line at times was unclear. As usual Giovanni Ribisi plays a disturbing yet effective role. Definately a must have for a Depp collection.
1,this movie sucked!,"the book was pretty good, the movie was unbelievably boring and lame!!!!! how it could be this lame, i dont know. nothing happens. also it veers from the book, and still nothing happens. and what happened to that wild, sexual dance scene from the book. well, nothing, cause it didnt happen in the movie."
1,Horriable movie,I love Johnny Depp. But this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is slow. It drags and drags and drags on. The story line if there is one is hard to follow. I couldn't even make it to the end.
2,Quite Boring,I think the book must be way better. I have not read the novel but it seems one of those many cases when the movie based on a novel does not live up to expectations. I found the movie underdeveloped and as result boring and forgettable. One watch is more than enough for me.
1,Boring,"What a disappointment, all of the best parts were in the trailer. We were tempted to end the movie before watching all of it, it was that bad! Lots of dialogue that seemed to do no where. We should have read some of the other reviews before watching this movie! We hoping for something like ""The Tourist"" so you can imagine the disappointment."
2,The Bum Diary,"Say what you will about ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" at least it provoked a response, negative or positive, from the audience and it was true in spirit to Hunter S. Thompson's work. This film for the most part is two hours of ennui. It seems to me that they were trying to offer a watered down version of Thompson to attract a larger audience and failed miserably in the process. This is hands down the worst performance I've seen given by Johnny Depp. The character he's playing, a besotted writer, should be edgy but Depp renders him as harmless as Bozo the Clown. The good points of ""The Rum Diary"", few that they are, are Richard Jenkins turn as Depp's harried editor, breathtaking Puerto Rico ambience circa 1960, and Amber Heard for just being a dish. I thought this film laid a box office egg because it was inacessable. This mainstreaming of Thompson will please no one but the most hearty of Depp fans, my wife."
4,Rum Diary,I enjoyed this movie.I also loved Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas.This will be a movie I put on to relax and chill out.Yes it is a little on the slow side but in a good way.I found many scenes hilarious.I love Hunter S Thompson and Johnny's portrayal of him.This gets a thumbs way up from me!
5,Cool Rumba!,"I love Johnny Depp! I love this movie! Like going on a mad vacation. The sun was bright, the water was blue and the drinks were cooler than cool! Totally mesmerizing flick. Depp's best to date! Cool rumba!"
4,Johnny Depp,"I bought this because of it's star, because when Johnny Depp makes a movie it's usually a slam dunk. I've never seen a Johnny Depp movie where his acting disappointed. He's made better movies but I'm glad I bought this movie. I really enjoyed this."
2,We got like 30 minutes into it and had to turn it off,"I tried to watch this movie twice, and just couldn't get into it. I like Johnny Depp, and I like rum, but this just wasn't for me."
2,meh....,"as is the case in most print-to-film productions, this was not really true to the book. i was disappointed that the movie cut the entire begining of the book out. you get a little glimpse into events that may have lead to Hunter's eccentric behavior and the random flailing of his limbs. towards the end, Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) displays a little of the Hunter S. Thompson-esque behavior that so many enjoyed in Fear and Loathing. it is mildly entertaining at best. Amber Heard is ridiculously hot. she certainly made this movie easier to watch."
3,"Men's 7"" Compression Shorts","Actual fit / compression of shorts in crotch area is not as good as the previous pairs of Under Armour Compression Shorts. The addition of the mesh crotch and resulting space for a cup reduces the compression / support in the crotch area for non-cup buyers, such as my self. What happened to the great fitting but similar shorts minus the cup mesh and with the different cut of material in the front?Thank you"
2,Didn't hold up very well,"While these stayed together, they were very good (I'd have given them 4 stars). Maybe I'm expecting too much, but these only lasted about 6-8 months before the seams along the inner thigh pulled apart. I bought five pairs of these and only walked about 5 miles per week in each pair (one pair per day), washed them on the delicate cycle in our front-loading washer, and always hung them to dry. All five pairs failed within a 3-week period. I've switched to the Champion compression shorts, which seem to be made of an even lighter fabric, but I haven't had them long enough to know if they'll hold up better."
5,"Love 'em, but Pricey!",Greatest underwear I have ever owned. You can wear them under anything and feel comforatable all day long. I just wish they were a little more affordable.
5,Great product,"I don't like to waste my money, I figure no one really does so these are a great purchase. They last a long time, I own three pair that I use to work out and play ball the cup insert has come in very useful!! Very Useful!! (had to say it twice) I love these!! I bought one and wore those out so I purchased three others!"
4,Good,Overall good product. I wear it for BJJ. I recommend using a jock strap instead of the cup holder
3,A Little Expensive,"I'm not very particular about compression shorts. I bought five different pairs of shorts just to see if there was a difference. My conclusion, buy based on price. Of the shorts I tried, none of them stood out as significantly better or worse than the others.Under Armour was one of the more expensive pairs, and I'd say, not really worth the extra money. These might be a great choice for somebody that runs long distance or is very particular. For me, they just weren't worth it.I tried two different models of McDavid (the least expensive and my preference based on price only), Asics, Champion, and these Under Armour shorts.Mcdavid Basic Compression ShortsChampion Men's Compression 6 Inch Inseam ShortASICS Men's Compression Short 7"
4,GSP would be pleased.,"I bought these for the express purpose of wearing beneath my gi when I roll (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu). They have a nice fit and support well. To give you an idea on the sizing, I'm 6'3"", 210 lbs who normally wears a 36"" waist and got the size XL shorts. Recommended."
1,Beware of fakes flooding the market!,"Caveat EmptorIn an unprecedented event with bluetooth headsets, Jabra has been besieged by JX-10 fakes flooding the market and being sold on many sites as the genuine article. These fakes are very convincing, almost defying detection, almost, but there are ways to tell the difference if you know how. The one thing ALL of the knock-offs [reportedly believed to originate from China] miss is the quality in operation and side-by-side comparisons in aesthetics. It is much easier to copy appearance than function.If you purchase the unit above, whether fake or non-USA, you're entirely on your own. The one star is for *proceed with caution*.AX~"
5,Angelina takes center stage!,"Based on the popular Angelina Ballerina books by Katherine Holabird, this video will not fail to delight promising ballerinas of all ages. My 3-year old daughter loves to hear the Angelina stories over and over again and was thrilled to see one of her favorite characters come to life!The animation is crisp and clear, almost seeming three dimensional at times. Two of the main characters, Miss Lilli and Angelina are voiced by Dame Judi Dench and her daughter Finty Williams. There could not have been better casting for these voices as they are soft, smooth, and very calm sounding even when Angelina is in crisis.The video consists of four 12-minute vignettes that deal with Angelina and her friends learning important lessons as they follow their dreams of becoming ballerinas. I think that both this one and Rose Fairy Princess will become staples in every little girl's video collection! Hopefully they will be releasing more in the future. Highly recommended."
3,Just so ya know,"I purchased this Dvd for my daughter's third birthday because she loves the Angelina Ballerina we watch on PBS. However, this was NOT the Angelina from PBS! The animator/illustrator is different, more like the illustrations in the original books. The stories were ok, but Angelina is more snitty and has more ""attitude"" than I remember on PBS. I miss the sweet, spunky ballerina who learns how to be a gracious, loyal, kind friend."
1,the worst sounding sacd in the world-ever,"i saw waters on this tour and i am a huge floyd fan but the sound on this sacd is awful!!!!!!!! it is so bad i actually unplugged all my cables and re-plugged them and it still sounded the same.the rear channels just sound fuzzy and ecoey,the bass is non-existent and the centre channel is not used on every track.i find it difficult to believe that the sound can be this bad having already got the normal cd which is infinitely better,especially when played through the concert/live processor on my amp. the music is great,though a bit clinical at times. could and should have been so much better."
5,The Best of Garland Biographies,"It is a shame that this book is currently out of print, for it is to my mind the only completely satisfying biography of entertainer Judy Garland available. Finch not only writes about Garland's life in well researched, eloquent prose, his work also provides a broad overview of the world and times in which Garland both worked and lived, with considerable reference to those who shaped her personality and her art, and who contributed to both public and private successes and failings. Truly a masterpiece of the biography genre, drenched with seldom-seen photographs as well."
5,The Water Cycle explained for the young.,"This is the Ocean is a readable fun journey through the water cycle. It is an excellant resource for anyone teaching the young about how water moves from the ocean to the clouds to the rivers and back to the ocean. It is written in lyric poetry, almost a song of water. The illustrations are simple, bright and engaging. I would recommend this book not only to school teachers but to all the other important teachers in a child's life."
3,Lost in space,"The author of this book went to the the moon but unfortunately the book still lurches in Earth orbit. Yes, the book is hard to get and my grateful thanks to Amazon for getting me a copy. Despite the splendor of the subject matter the book was a tough read. Too dry, too technical, too lost in words. Where was the personal touch? Where was Aldrin's inspiring rehabilitation from alcholism, the personal difficulties, the controversy over who would walk first on the moon. The latter makes it in print, but only just, and one can't quite help but feel with much selective editing. For real space buffs only."
1,Another Gear Fab Dud,"Gear Fab label is synonymous with boring 60s/70s. There's hardly anything on the label that isn't basic, boring, no-imagination formula grade school level 60s/70s pop-psych/garage psych etc. So if you have a boring life, zero imagination, and are extremely easily entertained, buy every title on that label. You'll be in boring geek heaven. And yes, this one is no exception."
5,Excellent!,"Marvellous story idea, wonderfully executed. The characterizations are handled exquistitely, the pacing is superb, one of the best of the Star Trek Novels.One quibble: the word you're looking for on page 184 is ""genteel"", not ""gentile""."
4,Star Trek TNG time travel story,"I picked this oldie up because of the time travel theme. In it Picard, while enroute to critical negotiations with the Gorn (ref TOS episode `Arena'), is hurled by an ancient artifact they find floating in space back to Cestus III just days before the outpost is attacked. While there, he struggles with his mandate not to alter the timeline and his feelings about the eminent massacre of the colonists.This is one of Michael Jan Friedman's MANY novels and reads just fine, but a couple things bothered me. The story doesn't make it clear why the artifact sent his to that exact time and place; random chance? Wow, even for a Star Trek novel that is a lot to swallow. Perhaps it knew what was on his mind just before sending him. And the story sure ended abruptly.I wouldn't say this is one of the better STTNG novels out there. Still, if you'd like to read another TNG story, read this one."
3,WAY TOO PINK,"I dont wear these at all because they are so pink. They look so much darker online, I would suggest the brown or black ones because the shape is actually cute."
1,piece of junk,"Stopped working after a week. I should've expected this from the moment I installed it. It feels like crap-quality and it's ability to pick up sound is laughable. They should've designed it to only pick up certain sound frequencies; for example, only deep, bassy sound. That would've made this product a lot more useful from the get-go."
2,Neither of tegners savate books are real great!,"Perhaps for the 1960'S this might be considered good; however I think the technique leaves much to be desired. Many of the low kicks are terrible (incorrect distance,lean and/or bending of support leg). The boxing is sloppy in terms of guard and stance (looks like modified karate).Even Tegners earlier Savate book has similar problems (especially concerning distance control and extension in kicking).Savate is a very efficient art - assuming its performed corectly.However a good book for the price. You can even learn from a bad book."
2,Savate: French Foot and Fist Fighting,"Although this book provides a nice, but brief, review of the history of Savate, the way that the techniques are presented is not, in my opinion, true to Savate. The traditional names for the techniques are often not used. This is especially true for the kicking techniques, as the way in which they are presented is more consistent with westernized ""kickboxing"" than traditional Savate. However, the book does offer some nice sparring drills and even some solo routines to follow. I think a ""kickboxer"" would find this book of greater value than someone specifically interested in Savate."
2,A second rate book,"This is not worth reading, it gives a skewed and inaccurate view of Savate. For a more comprehensive and thorough look at the art of Savate, try the Encyclopedia of Danse De Rue Savate by Paul-Raymond III Prof. Buitron. Its full of detailed descriptions and pictures to help you learn as well as a detailed history. Check it out!"
2,Hard to hear,Very difficult to position the phone to hear properly otherwise it is OK. Have had trouble with Second unit hearing that is.
5,Fits great... easy to dispose and replace with a new one,"Fits great in the Littermaid Elite Mega. Even better, they are at a great price! When one is filled... pop it out and replace with another one. They even come with lids!"
2,shipping charges negate the cost savings,"If you do the numbers, you will find that the name brand bins are cheaper (if u do free shipping) because they want over $12 to ship these...which is ridiculous."
5,Great buy,"Excellent quality, and less than half price of other places. Will last me for a long time, but worth the price."
3,Doesn't quite fit Littermaid Classic LM580,"We bought these for Littermaid Classic LM580. But they don't quite fit. So we had to cut some of the corners to force it to fit. But still it's not like the originals. It looks like these were made to accomodate various models. If I had known before we bought these, we would buy orginals from Littermaid."
2,Not a good fit,I bought these for my littermaid and I am having difficulty putting it in and taking out due to it being a little too big.
1,Not worth it,The lids did not fit into the slots on my LitterMaid box. I gave them 1 star because of the resulting odor and the litter ends up on top of the lid at times. Not worth the savings.
3,litter maid liners,"Although the littermaid cat products are not the best, it is better than the old fashioned way... and the price on these liners are fantastic! I have searched for better, but always return to Amazon to repurchase these, they are a must have!"
5,Awesome!,"These trays are great. They arrive on time, work perfectly, and are very affordable. I would highly recommend them."
4,LMR200 Litter Pan Receptacles,"The shipping is quick and relatively well packaged. As others have said about this product, they are somewhat flimsy so be careful not to let themget away when changing receptacles. If I remember correctly, shipping and handling is a little higher than you might expect."
4,great product for price,This is a great product for the price!! I've shopped around for the best deal and this is it! The only dissatisfaction I have is that it took nearly 3 weeks from purchase time to arrival time. I was expecting the product sooner.
5,The 60 Pack LMR200 is a Great Deal,"This 60 pack of LMR200 is superior to the 12 or 18 packs found in most pet stores. The lids properly align up and fit the holes to the Littermaid pans, something which usually cannot be said for the 12 or 18 packs I used to purchase at pet stores. I also think that, in general, the quality is better."
1,This book contains serious errors,"There is a section in this book that claims that Oracle stops writing to datafiles while in hot backup mode. Although this is a common misconception, it is nevertheless false."
4,If you have to carry one oracle book around this is it.,Each chapter is dense with useful information. If you have to carry one Oracle book around this one has it all. It is concise yet includes anything and everything you might encounter when dealing with oracle databases. It has been an invaluable resource while in school and on the job. It's an incredible deal for under $50. I highly recommend it as an excellent resource guide.
1,Waste of time and money,Don't waste your money ... trust me! This book tries to cover all areas of Oracle without providing much information on any single topic. It's basically one thick catalog of Oracle products.
4,Great Shoe..,This shoe is great. It even came with an extra pair of shoe strings that had a different design. The only thing that I felt it lacked was extra comfort. I wear Skechers and have done so for years and I have had other styles that were more comfortable although this was not top comfort it was definitely wearable and did not hurt my feet.It was a great deal that I just couldn't pass up and definitely worth the price :)
3,these are alright...,"I'd recommend only getting this light if you only plan on using one per module, they tend to dim and don't easily distribute power. don't use these if you plan on doing something other than plugging them into your comp. I got these to light up a buddies bass cab, had to re-wire them cuz they werent long enough and got a better set of nobs and switches, but the wire these were manufactured with sucks. not mention these are only bright at a distance. they could light an entire living room but didn't really do much inside the cab. so again, i'd only use these for pluggin directly into your comp as intended and nothin else."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I've been using this unit for about a month now. It works really good, but you will need to adjust the sensitivity notch and your speakers volume level for it to perform well.The sticky velcro pads work well unless you start moving them since they lose their ""stickiness"" fast."
1,Poorly made pedal broke,"Although we really liked the design of this trash can, it broke only four months after we bought it. For the price, we thought it should last a little longer. The pedal mechanism attaches to the lid with molded-on tiny plastic pins. These sheered off. We are a couple with no children and the can did not receive particularly hard use. Very disappointing."
2,Mechanism broke in about a year.,"I had a similar experience to the previous reviewer. First the mechanism started requiring more force (I later realized that one of the plastic pins had broken off) and then it failed altogether (the other pin broke off). It lasted about a year, but I expected more from it."
1,Plastic opening mechanism broke within a month,The attractive plastic trash can did not perform as I would hope with rapid spontaneous breakage of the pins that open and close the lid. Would not suggest it as an acceptable product unless it is redesigned.
3,"Great art, bad paper quality.",The art is great. The drawing and coloring are a sight to behold but its all done a disservice as it is all printed on crappy paper and small I guess because its an all ages title. This comic deserves to be printed large on glossy paper as soon as Disney / Marvel can get the chance to do so!
1,Worst Re-make Ever,I am a long time Spidey fan and have read every essential spider-man book and ultimate spider-man book. This one tries to recreate the classic stories almost word for word just with more technology. The dialogue is very bad and the art goes downhill after the first couple of issues. The first ish actally reprints ish 2 of Amazing Spider-man and the rest of the series keeps reprinting the next. I really don't understand the need to recreate Spider-man for he twentyith time especially with the success of ult. spidey. If you really want this book go to taret and the have larger version of this book for a dollar which I believe is the only good price for this book!
3,Try not to be confused,"First off, ""Brightblade"" is the name of the knight that gets Galen into all this trouble. My question is, is this an ancestor of Sturm's, or a descendant? Then there's this lengthy story that ends up revolving around revenge from a dead ancestor of the ""damsel in distress."" At certain points in the book, I was left with ""What???"" Get the book if you like the different aspects of the DL world, but don't think this is the average DL book."
4,A very good book,"I have always considered this book, along with Galen Beknighted, to be my favorite Dragonlance novels. I found them to be very well paced, interesting and entertaining. Also, I loved the subtle humor. I happened to buy this book at GenCon '89 at the TSR booth (before they turned it into a castle) where Michael Williams was signing autographs. My autographed copy of this book is a special treasure."
2,Whiny brat grows up (a little),"The last third of this book was pretty good, but the first 2/3's almost made me give up. The Pathwarden family is a typical ""new money"" family with very bratty kids. There are better ways to present a self-centered character than those used by the author."
3,"Weasel's luck gets him by, barely","this book is very slow compared to the others, around page 120, or chapter 7 i am guessing someone told the author to lighten the mood a little. apparentlly it worked, and the book is lifted from the mire."
4,A good Dragonlance book!?!?,"Aside from the Weis&Hickman books, Dragonlance novels have almost universally sucked. This, along with the sequel, Galen Beknighted, is a rare exception. The characters are well-defined and always interesting. The dialogue is sharp, and Williams has a good satirical eye for nobles. One of the few books in the series worth your time."
2,Wicked boring.....painfully so.,"This is the first DL book I've actively debated not finishing. This book made the Jean Rabe books seem great by comparison to this monotonous tub of dung.The beginning was slow and written with an excruciating level of detail, internal monologue, and bouncing around from past present and future in reference to Galen being a little brat and getting around punishments for his behavior.After the first few chapters the bouncing around was ditched...thank God, but the monotony of detail and internal conversations continued or even increased.I suffered through this until page 160 or so last night. I'm considering skipping the rest of this book or at least just jumping to the end to have closure on this crap I've read so far (something I've never done before with a book, especially a DL book!). I'd much rather read Kaz the Minotaur I think!~JoE~"
2,"Slow start....slow middle, good at the end","Of all of the ""Dragonlance"" novels I've read, this one was definately one of the most boring.There is an odd dynamic between Galen ""Weasel"" and his two brothers Brithlem, and Alfrec. Alfrec apparently being a sadastic moron, and Brithlem well on his way towards being a wizard.This is a very well written book, and Galen is very honest about his own personal shortcomings. But the sad fact is, there is just too much detail from galen himself on his views of the world around him, his brothers, etc. This book suffers from the lack of real action till the last three chapters. If you are just a devoted fan of the whole fantasy genere, then this is a book for you, but, if you are a fan of fantasy with lots of action, or different races, or magic even, then you might want to skip this one..."
2,Boring!,I read this(and Galen Beknighted)the first time about 5 or so years ago when I threw myself into this cool series.I read them then & didn't like them so I decided to give them another chance when I started reading the Dragonlance books in order. I didn't make it through the 3rd chapter. I liked the idea of a cowardly sort-of hero like Galen but not the writing of the book.
5,Exactly what I expected,This works great and arrived without being broken or anything. Zoo Tycoon is an old favorite that any kid would love to play.
1,Did not work properly,"The dinosaur digs expansion pack did not even come up. The tutorials are not there and it stops when you try to put in the marine mania animals in their tanks. Great, what a waste of money."
3,Steep learning curve,"I purchased this for my sons (10 and 7) to share. This is not the kind of game the kids can jump into and start playing. I insisted they go through the tutorials to learn what to do. The tutorials are thorough but tedious. However, the boys like the programmers' sense of humor -- instructing one task and then taking it back b/c the animal was not happy -- and the games' potential. We'll have to append this review after they've played the full games a few times."
1,Not so kool-aid,"this game is definately not as fun as zootycoon 2. it's stupid that you can't go to the ground level and interact with the people...the game has messed up my computer and whenever i play it, it quits/freezes. NOT WORTH THE MONEY... spend your money on something more entertaining."
1,NO!!,Zoo Tycoon the complete edition is a discraceful simulation game.Here is what is good about it:- the concept- the animalsHere is what is bad about it:- the graphics are poor at best- the gameplay is slow and tiring- it is absolutely simple- there is no depth to the gameIn general the utilization of the concept of a zoo tycoon was abysmal. Buy this product at YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!
1,Product molded before 30 days,"Product is well liked by my dog, but I'm not going to give her a moldy potato chew. What's up I just ordered them and now they are in the trash and I paid the previous list price. Not dependable."
5,Our dogs love this!,Our 3 dogs absolutely love this product. We cut them down to smaller size treats for the little guys and they chew away for quite awhile even on the smaller portions.
5,Amazing shipping!,"I ordered this on Sunday and it arrived on Wednesday! I am very happy with the product, my dog loves them."
2,when it works its great,"I think i got a couple from a bad lot,the two i had both are problematic.One made allot of noise while playing,the other was quiet but after a week or so stopped playing anything but dvd's (no CDR CDRW oR PICTURE DISKS ETC)"
1,"weebie, husband is a sony fan...","I do not recommend this item. When I received this DVD player it did not work right off hand. I cut it on put a disc in and it read ""no disc"", and then it was very hard to get the disc back out. It did not want to eject the disc. From now on I will stick with Sony although it might cost a bit more but my T.V., 2 DVD players, 3 VCR's, surround system, and playstations are doing just fine. I had bought it for a Christmas present, but WON""T EVER stray from Sony again!!!!"
2,Too Noisy,"I was in need of a DVD player and on a budget. I bought this for 79.00 at the Post exchange on Fort Campbell. While it does work , it makes a lot of noise after a while. I kept hearing this humming noise coming from the DVD. If you can get past the noise, this is a good deal, if not, then keep looking."
2,Disappointing introduction to the world of DVD,"My first DVD player and unfortunately, not my last. I guess you get what you pay for.I like the features of this model and the picture quality it delivers is fine but some big drawbacks:* fiddly and badly labelled remote(and no compatability codes for my universal remote)* comes packed with a garish in-store display piece glued on top of the unit* persistant vibrations and rattle as the disc spins.I won't choose APEX again."
1,AVOID THIS BRAND AT ALL COSTS!!!,"I've had this unit for about a year and a half, never had any of the problems as noted by other users (door problems, no-disc errors, etc) but now it simply stopped working. The power light comes on but nobody's home."
2,Keep Looking,"My machine is extremely, annoyingly, noisy! I've never owned a dvd player before, but I just can't imagine people having to tolerate that background flutter. On some disks, the picture ""locks up"" momentarily quite often. This too is quite annoying. I returned the machine to my local dealer and he replaced it with a new one, but I don't have a lot of hope for this new machine."
2,it's dead,"I had this DVD player for 5 or 6 months. Worked great for a few months with no problems but then it made clunking noises and you could hear the DVD spin loudly. Then it couldn't read any dual-layered DVDs. Recently, it lightly scratched up one of my DVDs because the disc was still spinning after a disc error when I opened the tray. The disc was previously brand new without any scratches or even dust. The player worked again for a couple days but now, it won't read any discs at all. I don't recommend this player and I will never buy Apex machines ever again. Time to go for a more dependable brand name DVD player."
3,Bare Bones but Adequate,"This is a cheaply made player (remote is toy-like) with few of the bells and whistles or the quality of construction you will see on better known brands - which also cost 2-3x as much. However, it does the job insofar as handling and viewing DVD's are concerned and I feel you definitely get your money's worth.I hope it doesn't break down, as the basic warranty is only 3 mos., and I am not impressed with their service facilities - no 800 number for troubleshooting, for example."
5,Unmatched value with no compromises short of Home Theater,"I don't know why some reviewers say this unit ""just"" plays DVD's, so don't expect any ""bells and whistles."" It has every fast and slow motion, frame by frame, and zoom feature I could ever think of using. The picture and stereo sound quality is simply superb. With the exception of a Home Theater connoisseur who must have reference quality 5-channel audio, I can't see anyone being disappointed with this incredibly low-priced unit. I also don't understand some complaints about the remote being too small. I am a man with large hands, and find the remote comfortable, and easier to use with one hand than most cell phones. Why pay more?!"
3,Works great for the first year only!!!,"This thing was great when it was working. Played all sort of formats for it's day and was relatively compact. Then after a year or so, the damn thing started acting up with freezing and skipping and eventually it gave out. There are plenty of hacks for it, but with prices so low for a new DVD player, it's not even worth your time to play with it. I didn't try to repair it, instead it was replaced by a Philips DVD player which could play DivX MPG4 too."
1,Not worth the money,"I got this for christmas 2004. Played 5 DVD's on it and started to get the ""No Disk"" reading. I only had it for 1 month. I sent it back and they are replacing it since it is under warranty but they are replacing it with a different model. We will see if it has the same problems. According to reviews of the 1700m model I expect the same. I suggest you spend a little more money and get a better DVD Player."
1,good for 1 - 200 hours,"My Apex AD-1600 worked great on DVD's, VCD's, MP3's, and WMA disks. After less than 200 hours use (but more than one year), it gives ""no disc"" error for any disk.For people with ""no disc"" error, try this fix (worked for me):CAUTION - possible electrical or laser hazard - CAUTIONhttp://www.soundreproduction.com/discussion/home_theater/messages/885.html"
1,Fragile,"I bought the older version of this model and a month later I had to send it to the manufacture to have it repaired. I got it back and it no longer played VCD's because the new model didn't. I argued with APEX for two weeks. Finally they agreed to fix it like the original. I still had to pay for shipping again. They couldn't seem to comprehend why they should have to pay for shipping when I was having the same problem fixed. They have some real dopes in their service department. Anyway this thing is broke again. I give up, buying the new Samsung. Later APEX."
1,Yeah...no good.,"When I came to college this room my room was lacking a DVD player. So I started looking around on Amazon and came across this model. The price was great. My parents have an Apex DVD player that works like a charm. So in early fall, I bought this one. Now, three months later, ironically just as the parts and labor warantee runs out, it has ceased all usable operation entirely. We've had to start using a friend's PS2 to watch movies. On top of that, I've tried various methods of getting ahold of Apex so they can maybe fix the problem but nothing has worked. The phone line is always busy. I emailed them almost three weeks ago and haven't heard from them. I submitted my problem through their website a week ago and haven't heard from them even though it's only supposed to take a few days. So now I'm out sixty dollars and have a DVD player that doesn't work at all."
1,"This is a piece of junk, and customer service is no help....","we have had this machine for 10 months, and it refuses to play any movie DVD, including brand new ones. Support is not helpful either, and have waited several weeks for them to get back to me. Avoid this product!"
2,"Good Unit, BUT has problem","I bought this unit at a grand opening of a local electronic store chain (for $59.95+tax) & in general it's worked great (we have a good player, but got this for our computer room). HOWEVER, recently, it has started failing to recognize that I have a disc in the tray & when I did some searching online, found out that this is actually a relatively common issue for the AD-1600. Also read that people are having problems with APEX providing warranty service. Several said that APEX denied ever receiving their faulty DVD player even when the person had the signature form that the APEX person had to sign to acknowledge the return of the unit. Wish now that I'd not bought it. May call the electronis shop, but may just buy another, different brand of low end player."
1,Bad Product (lots of problems),"This is a very poor DVD player.no wonder why they sell it for this low price . The Sound output is bad and the Picture often freezes ( something like a PC hangs up) and frames get skipped, most of the times i get a no disc message when i pop in a dvd/cd i have to open/close the tray number of times before its plays the disc sometimes i have to Swith off/On the player to make it work ,its very frustating i dont think they invested any money on quality control bcoz the first piece i got the disc tray would not open at all i had to return it and get another one I'd go with a major name brand next time."
5,A solid DVD player,"Bought this machine six months ago and have been using it heavily. It works great. It even plays VCDs, which are cheap and popular here in Manhattan, esp. if you are into Asian (i.e., Hong Kong) films. The remote control is pretty user-friendly. I like this DVD player a lot."
1,tray wont open,"I got this APEX dvd player for my daughter for her birthday. I felt this would be a good buy for the second DVD player in the home. I have now had to return one because the disc tray wouldn't operate at all and I received the replacement today and the tray also won't open. I am beyond frustrated, and will not seek a third. Great deal...Great birthday present? In one word...NO!"
1,lemon,"Took it out of the box, plugged it in and heard lots of little noises accompanied by a small flash of light and bad smell. Now it will not even come on."
2,Sound skips on dolby digital dvd's,"Every dvd that has dolby digital has skips in the audio. some worse then others. It's a brief pause but it can occur as often as every few minutes. I tried playing with all the audio settings and all the audio outputs. I used all combinations of settings but the skips are still there. Unless someone can tell me about another setting that i'm missing, this unit will go back."
2,Functional - but only barely,"I can't agree more that you get what you pay for --- especially with this model. The unit does work, but there are many problems.1) DisplayThe characters on the digital display are extremely difficult to read ... almost cryptic.2) MenuThe menu system is difficult to navigate - compared to the Toshiba and Sony units I already own.3) Software IssueAfter playing a DVD and sitting idle for a while (like overnight), the unit freezes up and won't respond to commands. The only way to resolve the problem was to power the unit off and on.In short - the unit does play DVDs and MP3s as promised. The remote is functional. The mechanical aspects of the unit are acceptable. However, for another [money] you can get a more robust and easier to use machine."
2,Not Playing VCD !,"Should have listened to others' reviews. This player does not play VCDs bought from China.(It displays ""No Disk""). Other players from Sony, Toshiba and Apex AD-2500 all play at least. Hello...? I thought this player is ""made in China"" ? I end up with buying Apex AD-2500 and Sony 315 players instead. Don't buy this one if you ever think you need to play VCD (don't buy Toshiba either, for other playing VCD issues)."
1,Disappointed,"I too had trouble with this DVD player - it reads no disc when there a disc inside, it freezes the DVD and won't continue, the door sometimes doesn't open. It's [worthless]. I too would spend the extra money for a Sony or other more reliable name brand."
4,Tip-Top,"Great player for the price... plays all formats.Also has a small form factor - looks high quality and nice silver tone, build quality is as good as Toshibas. Picture output quality is great.Only thing lacking is the region hack and macrovision hack which I hope will be available soon as more ppl begin to own this player.Also lacks component video outputs."
1,.... that died after 5 months,"Well, it sounded good, the price was good, but it only lasted 5 months before it suddenly no longer plays DVDs OR MP3 audio CDs. It still manages to play regular audio CD's, but I can hear the play mechanism inside grinding a bit. I have another DVD player, a JVC, and it has lasted 2 years with no problems. The warranty on the AD 1600 is 90 days labor, 1 year limited parts. I see many similar bad reviews of this product... All I will say is that this was the first, and will be the last Apex product I buy.It managed to play every media type it claimed to, but 5 months???"
1,Unhappy in the Burgh,"Just like the Customer from Ill., I Purchased the Apex AD-1600 spent the time in hooking it all up, as my 4 year old sat in anticipation I push the button to open the tray to except the Disney DVD that we purchased to watch & nothing happened, try telling a 4 year old that the DVD doesn't work & we'll have to send it back, I'm still trying to return it to Apex & I'm getting the runaround, THANKS APEX FOR A WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!!!"
4,"Works great, reads every format I've thrown at it","This box is great. I should've bought one a long time ago. I've read the reviews that some people were not able to play VCDs but so far I haven't had a single problem playing VCD, SVCD, DVD-R and all the other normal formats. I've burned most of the VCD and SVCD on cheap CDR media and the DVD-R myself and have had no playback problems so far. The remote isn't very ergonomically designed and range isn't very good (you have to point it at the unit), but the price and performance of the unit overall is unbeatable."
1,DVD did not open!!,I should have read reviews before I purchased....I just received this I opened up the package hooked it up and the DVD door did not open! The remote looks ancient and the DVD looks cheap. I didn't expect the best but I did expected it to work. I had to return. It will be worth spending a little more money for better brand. DOn't gamble on this you will loose. I did.
2,$39.00 for Labor,"It was a good DVD player until it broke down after its 90 days limited labor coverage. It can not reads any of my DVD discs. Based on Apex website, it needs the laser head realignment. Apex Digital wants [X] for the labor charge. It seems Apex does not make good quality products."
2,Not all that great,"Video is blocky sometimes during the playback of VCD's. Small scratches in DVD's cause skips where as other DVD players would play right through them. Broke down after 2 months, I guess I'll now see how good the warranty is."
4,Great deal,"This dvd player is great.the only thing I don't like is the remote is a little small for me, and when you want to use the volume button it is already at max volume.Other then that this thing is GREAT."
1,"Shake, Rattle and Hum","I bought this about 6 months ago. I now have it in mothballs, since I started getting the dread, ""no disk"" message periodically.When it works, it often sounds like a Mack Truck, but not always. Wasn't able to figure out the source of the terrible vibration noise.Overall quality is poor, and I would avoid this beast."
4,Cheap and it worked for me.,"I purchased this DVD player more than 4 months ago and so far I haven't had any problems playing DVDs or VCD/SVCDs I've purchased and burned myself.The material they used for the exterior and bottom has a very cheap feel to it, but you get what you pay for and I'm very happy it works with everything I throw at it.There are a lot of bad reviews so I guess it is hit or miss."
1,both cheap and really annoying,"I took this back to the store.To get any response from control buttons on both the DVD and the remote took pushing the buttons hard several times. The buttons on the remote are small and too close togetherThere are a lot of menu items but no working explainations in the user manual.I got a vertical picture about 1/3 of screen size and was unable to change it despite 30 minutes of trying various menu combinations. A better user's manual might have helped, but the controls are so annoying I would have still returned it."
1,not worth the money...,When it was hooked up there were lines accross the screen and everything sort of faded in and out. No matter what TV it was hooked up to and how many configurations I tried it basically comes down to this DVD player is a total disapointment
2,Questionable reliability,"The company that sells the Apex brand of electronics is based in South Korea and designs its products in South Korea and manufactures them in other Asian countries with low labor costs. The DVD players are mostly manufactured in China, and they tend to promise a lot of features but have questionable design and build quality. The AD1600 out of the box seems a decent DVD player, if a bit flimsy looking, but after about 3 months it would give occasional, but annoying, ""no disc"" errors. I also can't get VCDs I bought in Asian shops to work in this model. Anyone else having similar problems?In the future I think I'll stick with Japanese brand names like Sony, Panasonic, JVC, Pioneer, and also European names like RCA (French) and Philips (Dutch), for better quality, which ultimately gives a better value."
4,Why Apex won't play you VCD's!,"I have a lower level model than this one but it works just fine for the price you can't beat it. I have read a couple of the reviews for this item and see that some of you haven't been able to get your import VCD's to work. There is a reason for that other than ""Apex sucks"" which of course is not true. There could be a possibility that the VCD's you are trying to view are in a foreign TV format, which is called PAL. American TV sets use the NTSC standard and will not display the PAL format thus you would have to convert your PAL VCD's to NTSC. Learn more at VCDhelp.com and yes the Apex is cheap but I have watched many a VCD, SVCD and DVD with no issues. The higher end manufactures cost a whole lot more and do a whole lot less."
4,Pleased !,"This was my first DVD Player. I am very pleased so far, it plays every type of CD/DVD I have put in it so far and does this automatically. I have noticed a shadow when Titles or Text appears on the TV however not sure if its the TV or DVD player, TV is a GE Model (not the Greatest). Hopefully when TV is replaced soon, I will get to experience the best of the DVD Player."
1,Read ALL Reviews - Don't Buy!,"Should have read ALL reviews! Machine is a few months old and refuses to read any disc ... ""No Disc"" is all it says ... if you hit it, it catches and ""might"" read the DVD. Seems to be a pattern of [quitting] at over 90 days ... when the labor warranty expires which means the cost of repair is greater than buying a new one ... regardless of one year parts warranty! VERY disappointing!"
1,Fatally flawed product,"I have owned this DVD/CD player for a couple of months. This product is fundamentally flaced. The majority of the time, the door does not open, whether there is a disc in the player or not. Turning it off does not make a difference, it just will not stop spinning. It's tough to play a DVD when you cannot get the disc into (or out of) the player.Additionally, on some discs, sometimes, near the end it starts to lock up the image. Obviously, the laser does not oversample enough to track the inside of the discs accurately.I paid for this, and it was wasted. Circuit City refused to accept it back, saying it was a typical problem with cheap DVD players. So, you are warned. In this case, you get what you pay for."
3,"Great Player, but Apex dropped VCD support !","I got this player in Nov 2002 mostly to test and play VCD and SVCDs. I was pleasantly surprise that it was nicely build, and easy to use. It played SVCDs, mp3, jpegs (!), DVDs, but whenI tried to play a VCD, 'NO DISC'. After some research on the internet, I found out that Apex has dropped VCD as a supported format due to licensing issues. The only chance to get an Apex VCD capable player is to get an ""old stock"" version.So, I had to return it. What is Apex thinking?I'd buy 2 if it did VCDs, but now I went and bought a phillips580HT (vertical DVD at Target), which does it all. (for 2 times the price:( )For what it does do, 5 stars, for dropping VCD support,a no-buy and knock it down a few stars."
1,Piece of crap,Like most of the other people who bought this piece of junk it quit working after a few months. You put a disk in and there is a loud noise and a bunch of colors jumping across the screen and everything is frozen. I will be throwing it in the trash and buying a reputable brand.
1,Disposable DVD,"Thought this seemed too cheap but thought I'd give it a shot as it works with so many formats. Unfortunately, the machine is a piece of junk. Takes a long time to read disc, door jams, and after just 2 weeks would just whirrr and vibrate. I used it only 6 times all told. I should have spent the money on a better machine in the first place. ..."
1,Don't assume that it plays VCD,"Don't know how long it will last. Out of the box, I tried & found that it cannot play VCD, but it plays SVCD though. I just cannot beleive there is an DVD player today that cannot play VCD. Look the descriptions, it does not say it plays VCD. Don't assume.Picture & sound quality are Ok (just average) I found remote control & set up menu ... are easy to use actually. Kind of noisy when opening /closing the tray. Plays DVD, SVCD, MP3, CDR, DVDR OK. No play VCD. Did not try other type"
1,Don't buy it!!,"I am not happy with this product. I have had my DVD Player for about 9 months, and about 6 months into it, it had trouble recognizing there was a DVD in the player. It may be cheap, but you get what you pay for. Please save yourself a headache and get a different DVD player"
1,Don't buy it -- update,"It can properly play DVD, CD, MP3. But it seems it cannot play VCD or SVCD. The video and audio is ok for me, because I only have quite poor TV.Howeve, it have no clock on it. And when playing some disks, it'll make some annoying noise.---------But right after 30 days I received it, it could not play any disk. When I inserted a disk, it just showed ""No Disc"", and refused to work. And, also, because it is after 30 days, I cannot return it back to Amazon. Really a poor quality product."
4,it's okay...,"First, I start with saying that the whole Reggae Gold serie is a pretty good one, and this '2000' version is no exception to the rule. Good choice of songs, good variety. But my opinion is, that these albums are meant for the people who listen to dancehall once and a while. Because people who collect a lot of dancehall music, and buy the diverse riddim-albums also, will find out that the most songs on this CD will already be in their music-collection. For these people, only the extra CD with the Adonai remixes will be really interesting."
4,I Loved It!!,I love this CD. This is the exact CD that my hotel played at the open air bar when I stayed in Negril.
4,CD #2 Is Disappointing,"CD #1 is a great CD, songs like ""Hot Gal Today"" (#4) and quite a few others on Disc #1 make the CD worth buying. Disc #2, however, was quite disappointing to me. I expected ""dance"" remixes to the tracks on Disc #1. Actually it turns out that distinguishing between one song and another on Disc #2 is a challenge in itself. The same beat remains constant throughout the disc, making it monotonous to listen to. Good music if you can't fall asleep or something, but beware, may cause headaches. If you are fimiliar with some of the artists on Disc #1 then by all means purchase this CD because Disc #1 is a fine CD, with many songs that can be listened to over and over again. Don't expect too much from Disc #2 however..."
2,I just don't like this book...,"It jumps from HTML to Java applets without even explaining what Java is, or anything about high-level languages. Then it skips to a chapter on mathematics, then databases... choosing strong passwords, buying computers... what is the author getting at? The only chapter I like is Chapter 16 - Artificial Intelligence. And don't plan on learning Java from this, they just throw a few code snippets at you with no info on the language or reference material of any kind.This is a recommended text for Harvard CS1 but so far I haven't really used it once. Now I know why they gave an open-book exam..."
1,Caution:Computer scientists and engineers - keep away,"This book should be renamed as ""Learn Computer Science in a week"". The majority of this book is for non computer science professionals who want to learn all about computer science. I would strongly recommend that this book only be read if you are a non computer science student or professional. However if you are a computer graduate or professional I recommend only reading the last 6 chapters (11 through 16). The author does have a relaxed and easy writing style and makes difficult concepts look easy. I specially enjoyed the Public/Private key and encryption description (chapter 11); except of the last few chapters I find the rest of the book boring; however this may be because the book was not written for readers like me (i.e. computer professionals). This book is best suited for a quick course in Computer Science for sophomore."
2,Luckily I got it for around $20,"I wear a large, most clothing manufacturers fit right or too small and this thing was way too big. I tried to shrink it by washing and drying it and it worked a little bit but even after that it was still way too big. Hindsight - buy a small from these guys.It was made fairly cheaply even for a Halloween costume. I wore it to one party and by the time I went to the bathroom the second or third time (drinking was involved) the zipper broke and I couldn't wear it properly anymore. Luckily there was alcohol involved.2/5 for the look of it and some of the straps/authenticity."
3,Spare yourselves,"So many of Amazon's reviewers waxed lyrical about this novel that I felt certain it was a safe choice for a wonderful weekend read. Wrong! This is no better than a mass market suspense thriller. A woman of Muriel Spark's genius should never have given in to the temptation of writing for the market rather than from her soul.I am writing this review is to spare those of you who, like me, hope for a novel of the quality of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. While I would not go so far as to say that this novel is hopeless trash; if your expectations are high, it may cause you (as it did me) immense anguish."
4,Wickedly Dark,"Very creative and unique, this cd takes you on a ride into darkness and apocalyptic sound. Mixing doomsday industrial with more upbeat house beats, and topping it off with very disturbing vocals, this band makes for quite the trip.The thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that doesn't flow like an album. The collection of works seems a little haphazard and unorganized.But give it a few listens and I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"
1,Past Expiration Date,"I ordered these potato chips on August 5, 2006. The expiration date on the packages was May 2, 2006."
5,"Seriously, this is a big clamp","I read the previous review and thought, ""How big can this thing be? I can use this as an everyday clamp. That guy must be a wimp."" When it got here, I realized he was right. You could use it for smaller stuff, but why would you? I got these to get myself out of a veneering jam where I needed to put lots of pressure in the middle of a panel. They do the trick for that.These clamps are made very nicely. They are a definite step above the regular size tradesman clamps. The packaging is a little lacking (a cardboard envelope), but they weren't hurt, so I guess it is good enough. The picture shows a red wood handle, like other tradesman clamps, but it is delivered with a perpendicular sliding steel pin handle. It's probably a better choice for a handle with a high clamping pressure rating.I'm giving it a five star rating because it is a very well made, large, heavy clamp with lots of clamp pressure capacity, just like the description says."
4,GREAT HARD TO FIND DEEP THROAT CLAMP,"Took a while Searching to find this and the other deep throated clamps. Clamps are heavy but that is good considering the large timbers I am using them with. If you are working large timber that need deep throat clamps, you have found what you are looking for. Only negative is they did not come with all the red rubber pressure point pads."
5,Extremely informative book,"This book has a tremendous amount of useful information about the relationship between food and well-being. I spent 15 years and a lot of money trying to get help for my various symptoms only to be told I was a nervous person, and my mental state was probably causing my physical problems. I recently suspected I had food allergies and took dairy out of my diet with amazing results. I suspect I'm also allergic or sensitive to other foods and am getting ready to embark on an elimination diet. This book is informative but doesn't preach that food allergies are the cause of all symptoms. It gives other possible causes for specific symptoms. It's a great tool if you've exhausted other means and hope for feeling well. I now have hope that I could feel fantastic in the not-too-distant future. I also found a wonderful doctor who actually listens to me and doesn't brush me off. It's not wise to totally self-diagnose, you need a doctor who will listen and work with you."
5,fabulous book!,"This book is fabulous. I let a friend look at my copy and she loved it too, so I bought another copy for her. I highly recommend this book to absolutely anyone and everyone, noexceptions!"
2,too wordy and outdated,"This book does have some good information on food allergies and food intolerances, but the 470page book could be about 150 pages. The authors go on and on about all sorts of stuff that isn't directly related-- way to wordy. No many references and it seems like a lot of the information is opinion. Also, I've found more updated information on the internet."
1,"Wrong, Wrong, Wrong","All these posts must be by people who didn't actually take the time to READ THE BOOK!!!!! All I have to say is that the direction of current flow shown in the diagrams is either wrong, or varies widely between conventional and electron theory. For example, on page I-41 they show electron theory current flow from a battery through a lamp in the right direction (negative to positive), but then later in the section discussing Ammeters pages I-95 through I-104 they consistently show current flow going in the WRONG DIRECTION. Obviously the person who did the diagrams was confused and no one did a good job checking their work. This is the kind of thing that is terribly confusing for a person trying to learn ""BASIC ELECTRICITY"" and is just plain sloppy. I want my money back!!!"
5,"RADIO FOR BIGTNNERS, TUBE TYPE CIRCUITS",TO TEACN A 15 YEAR OLD BOY BASIC ELECTRYC AND BASIC TUBE CIRCUITS BEFORE HE BEGININGS SOLID STATE ELECTRONICS BY HIS GRANDPA.
5,Superb book.,"This book is an excellent learning tool. I have read other books on electricity and have always come away scratching my head. This book teaches everything about electricity and constantly reiterates prior lessons, to reinforce and differentiate from the current lesson.The book is in an easy to read format, with great pictures, and a reasonable pace of learning."
5,thrash/hardcore master piece,"Don't let the name fool you, this c.d. is a pure punk/thrash crossover master piece. Getiing their name from Vivian's jacket in the 'Young Ones' is cool enough, but this group tore St. Louis a new one over and over again. I don't think they were allowed to play anywhere at the end. If you like this, check out guitarist Pat's next project 'Head On Collision"""
4,A must for Floyd fans,"The book is subtitled ""a visual documentary"" - however it's more like the band's diary and scrapbook. Every appearance, concert, recording session and disk is cataloged in this amazingly well researched volume. A must for Floyd fans. The band's early history, particularly the 1960s, is well documented. Also done well is the famous Roger Waters / David Gilmour rift - this difficult history is analyzed so we can see each point of view. As the founding members go their separate ways, they have different paths in the book's catalog of events.The photographs are great and include many very early shots. I only wish that captions had been included, however. I'd like to know if any of the shows I attended were captured on film and included in the book."
5,"""Trip"" is a trip!","Do not buy this book looking for familiar signs of travel or a destination. The ""trip"" you, the viewer, embark upon is not the sort which gets you ""there"". Rather it is an experience akin to the wakening one might have following a long, vacant stare and realizing that, despite your own logic or familiarity with the world, the most common object has the potential for revealing puzzling, but significant, meaning.Through the use of her camera's frame and lens Lipper evokes/creates/invents realities that force unanswered questions and pose mystery. Frederick Barthelme's fiction hauntingly echoes the quality of dislocation permeated in the photographs. Together the text and photographs create an ambitious concept of contemporary existence.""Trip"" is a beautiful, smart, funny and disturbing book."
4,Very Cute,You can learn quite a bit about a ferret by reading this book. Their charming little (or should I say big) personalities shine through on every page. It was fun and I'm glad I got it. Every ferret owner can't help but smile as they read about the little guy's antics.Loved it!
3,Not as good as they say,"The people writing these reviews are not realistic. More than likely, they probably have never used the better names in handtools/knives.This knife is a bargain at $20, but I would not buy it. I have used mine for two weeks... here are the pros and cons:Pros: Inexpensive, pouch, cut out grip holes, safetyCons: Pliers useless, the slide mechanism gets stuck, you must take pliers out to use accessoriesGo with a better name... you get what you pay for."
1,disappointing,"did really bad, like a multipurpose made ''in china, I was very disappointed and would not recommend it highly. The clamp does not even have the return spring"
2,OK pocket pliers/knife/tools,"In order to get to any of the tools, you have to extend the pliers. Yes, extend. The pliers do not fold over, the way most pocket knives/pliers do. Instead, you flip the unit and the pliers extend. Then you can open the arms of the pliers and then pull open one of the tools. Also, when fully recessed, the tip of the pliers still stick out about 1/2 inch. Awkward in one's pocket."
2,you get what you pay for... if that,It's cheap. It feels cheap. It acts cheap.No way these reviewers know what they're talking about.They probably work for the company.Get a leatherman. It's worth it.
5,Really nice multitool,"It's a really nice and beauty multitool, with all the neccesary in a multitool. Very good quality and very useful."
3,Disappointed,Be aware that the knife blade shown in the photo is not the blade that comes with the multi tool. The length is shorter along with the contour of the blade. This change makes the blade difficult to open. I find that I must raise the adjacent tool to be able to grasp the blade and pull it open. The thickness of the blade seems to be less than my previous one which I lost and believe the blade will not stand up to heavy usage.
4,Gerber 05500 MP400 Compact Sport,"This is a sweet multitool, the only disadvantage of which is it needs regular lubrication for the one-handed opening to work really easily. It would also be nice to have a ruler engraved on the side like other models.The selection of blades is decent; as another reviewer noted, the scissors turn out to be really helpful. I also like the wire-snips for cutting small cable-ties and those annoying plastic tags that retailers put into sweaters.A quality product with no great drawbacks."
2,Overall eh...,"I was looking for an exact replacement. The picture was it. The product was not. The item shipped was not as pictured. Quite disappointing. And the product had a few rust spots on it. Besides that, it is a nice multi-tool if I wasn't looking for the exact product as in the picture."
5,Great tool!!!,I bought this many years ago and have used it for everything imaginable. The half serrated-half straight edge is perfect for cutting through anything and the scissors are good for precision work. Pliers are nice and sturdy and have been irreplaceable. I consider this tool the best $40 I ever spent.
4,"A decent tool, but the holster could be better","I lost my last Gerber tool at the Kabul airport when we were going to pick up someone. The ANP found the tool in the truck and confiscated it (not even going into the secure area). Lesson learned.I found I couldn't get an exact replacement for my lost tool which was about 6 years old, but I really like the Gerber design better than the competitors.This new tool is a little smaller, which is nice, and has all the common necessary tools. My only gripe would be the holster is about an inch wider than it needs to be. This seems to block pocket access on my pants, but at least it is fairly flat.Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this tool to a friend."
3,Quality not as good as before,"I have had one of these for several years, and I love it. However, this one I just received was a complete disappointment. The jaw had interference when closing it, at the wire cutter area. Also, it felt very gritty, like it was tossed around in fine dirt. I also think the case is too big - bigger than the one I currently have (and it's the same model). Unfortunately, I had to return it for a refund. Gerber, what happened to your quality?"
2,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"In short, this is a sub par video game. For a Harry Potter fan, it is exciting for the first few hours of gameplay, but quickly becomes repetitive and boring. The story line is short and take only a few hours to complete. This is NOT a game that you will be hooked playing for several weeks. The only challenge is solving some of the puzzles and getting to 100% completion. I do not recommend this game. Save your money and buy anything else."
4,Review: XBox 360: Harry Potter OOTP,"The game is really fun, specially if you're a Harry Potter fan. It has many details that they miss in the movie, details that give magic to the world of Harry Potter.The graphics are great, the controls and the dialogs too. It's quite a simple game, so kids can enjoy plaing it.It only has a couple of frustrating parts if you're the kind that likes to have a 100% complete, or if you're going for all the achievements."
3,No replay value,"This was a pretty good game. Better than the last HP game. But still not much replay value to it. I played it through and then sold it on ebay, I got my money back so I can't complain too much. IMO the last fun and really good HP game was Chamber of Secrets."
2,Nice but boring,"The game is quite boring because it has a lot of large and tedious dialogues, the story is too slow and the task are too repetitive, this makes a little heavy to complete the objectives. However graphic are not too bad and is quite nice to learn new spells and it has some mini games which give you a little breathe when you start to fell boring. I'm a little disappointed because a was expecting a lot of fights and more difficult and interesting missions, so if you like games which you don't have to worry about your life and stressing battles this is the game for you."
2,aweful game,"The game isnt particularly alot of fun. The reason why I have that opinion is because for all of the game you are wasting your time running around Hogwarts doing things for other people. The action that was in the book and in the movie is not playable in the game, most of the great action sequences are videos that you watch, you dont get to battle death eaters, or demeantors. You do however get to spar with classmates but that is very few and far between and doesnt last long at all. There just isnt enough in the game to keep anyones interest.The one good quality of the game is Hogwarts, the scenery is great and exploring the school is great because of its accuracey but thats where the enjoyment ends. I believe EA games should pay me back for wasting my time with it. Do not buy this game."
4,Almost Perfect,"Just got done with the game and if you like the books or movies you will love the game. Story and envirnoment are amazing, kinda of what you think it would be like to walk the grounds of Hogwarts. Minor problems with the camera sometimes but this is a must buy for any potter fan. No dueling online, too bad..."
3,Best one but...,"It's by far the best one yet but, I HATE THE CAMERA!! When you walk into a room sometimes the camera doesn't follow you right away so, you have to stop and wait for the camera to catch up with you.I don't like going through some of the same rooms over and over again.So, it's good but, try and rent it first. And on a good note...there are a lot of extras to collect and find. And I mean a lot!!!!!"
2,Too difficult,This game is too hard. Several people in the household tried and and we can't figure it out. We walked around and around and still didn't know what to do. I don't understand why this had to be so hard.
4,Great condition Great game,This was in amazing condition and is and awesome game!! I absolutely love the harry potter games for the xbox 360 I just wish they would make more of them!
5,Love It,"I love this game, it is really fun, and a great adventure game, if you like adventure games and harry potter then you will love this game! :)"
5,harry potter order of the phoenix,"bought it for my youngest grand son he really enjoys playing it,would recommend it ,for kids of all ages of any age will enjoy it"
5,text book,"Reminds me of a college text book. It's very informative, so be prepared. It's not just a collection of the myths."
2,Not the book I was expecting,"I purchased this book, because I thought it was a book with short stories on Greek Mythology. It's more like a history book, which is great for all of you who want to read about greek mythology in a historial point of view, but I wanted it to be more of a story book."
4,Just the right size,"Great for homeschooling. Good sized boxes allow me to put a short journal entry for a subject or for little ones' larger handwriting. A more durable cover would be a plus, but it's not overly large, thick or heavy."
4,can be adapted,This planner is very basic and has the days going vertical down the side and the subjects going across the top. The subject spaces are blank and are not preprinted. I like the planner because it is adaptable and can be used for other uses. I use it as therapy and supplement record book for my autistic son. I can keep up with things we do for therapy on a weekly basis and track his progress. Would recommend to anyone wanting a basic planner that you can write in.
2,was expecting more,"Picked this book up a used book store thinking I would learn more about the psyche of jealous people: what makes them tick, why do they think the things they do. I was disappointed when the story didn't deliver--had to force myself to finish it."
3,helpful to newbies,"I've just gotten into scrapbooking, and was a bit confused by some of the tools and materials on the market. This book provides a good review of scrapbooking tools and their use. Most of this material is taken for granted in magazines, and this book fills in the gaps."
1,Lasted just over year before battery failed to recharge,"This worked great when I first got it. I had several cross country trips to make within the first 6 months of purchasing it and it worked perfect.For reasons unknown it stopped accepting a charge. Whether it was from the wall or from USB or Firewire. It just died. Not only that, ever since it stopped accepting a charge it also drained my iPod video and it will no longer turn off. If I would have reviewed it 6 months after purchasing I would have given it 5 stars. I can handle the $60 spent on it because it really made those trips easier. But to have it suck the life out of my iPod and no longer work after just a year, I would give it negative stars if I could."
5,a total breakthrough,This is one of the most ground breaking bands of the late 80s'. Based on instrumental guitars it covers a very atmoshperic sound over to the louder distortions of early grunge. LISTEN TO WITH THE LIGHTS OUT FOR THE FULL EFFECT.
4,Worth it,"The two songs on this single are not as good as anything on Spiderland, but It is better than anything on Tweez, even if a different version of one of these songs, ""Rhoda"" is on Tweez. Actually these songs would sound right at home on Spiderland. There is little or no vocals, and both songs crescendo into loud, aggressive, chaotic noise. Somehow it manages to be slightly more than just a couple of ""ho hum"" math rock songs, like many other releases from this genre are starting to be, however. Also, I love the art on the cover. Its worth it just for the awesome cover. I would recommend getting this and the classic, ""Spiderland"" lp. I would also recommend checking out the band, ""Rodan"" and ""June of '44"""
1,Sulphur Dioxide- Toxic Preservative,"This product contains sulphur dioxide as a preservative, which if taken in high amounts could be toxic. Asthmatics should also be careful of products with sulphur dioxide, including many dried fruits. Care should be taken by the manufacturer to create products to avoid preservatives or use naturally occurring preservatives rather than chemicals."
4,Speck Case Review,The speck canvas sport case does a wonderful job protecting my zune on drops and prevents scratching on the screen. My only critizism on it is that I have to take it out of the case to use my fm transmiter.
1,same day follow-up to my review on this item,"One good thing is price 44 bucks is low cost, but it runs too hot.The fan runs too loud. I said in my first review that I may return it. Well 6 hours later I put in my hi End seasonic power supply cost is about 2.5 times this starTech. well I clocked my new build with the startech power supply and watched netflix stream a movie it pulled 65 to 71 watts. After I put in the seasonic x 660 power supply I stream a movie from netflix. just changed the power supply no other change and watched the same movie. it pulled 42 to 49 watts. this is about 2/3 the power for the same exact job. This is a huge difference in power.I returned the startech and suggest that you try to buy a better supply then this unit."
4,Pretty good.,"This was a pretty good DVD player for its time, and has served me well over the past two years. Only two or three of my 300 DVDs will not play on it. It also plays VCDs and SVCDs well.The small size of the unit is another plus.But it doesn't seem to play burned DVD-R, so I'm going to have to replace it."
1,Don't Buy!!!,"I just want to warn you about this companies equipment. They don't stand behind it at all. So far I have owned 2 of their prodects and neither one has lasted 1 year. Unfortunately, their warentee is for 90 days. This DVD playerworked fine for 9 months and then stopped working. This company does not stand behind their products and their customer service...well I guess they call it that...is useless. Trust me...don't buy anything from them. Save your money!!!"
1,Talk about pitiful service...,"I have heard nothing good about this typemodel, and since Apex refuses to stand behind theirproduct, I refuse to waste my money on it."
3,10-Key Touch Key,"The book is pretty good, but I couldn't use the CD, because my computer doesn't have the old 3.5 inch drive, so that part was of no use to me, which is unfortunate. I guess I should have read the system requirements, before I bought it!"
4,Definitely did its job!,This book is for people who would like to improve their touch key skills. It is priced reasonably well and it helps me develop better speed and accuracy in my calculator use.
2,Make That a Short Mile,"The product description talks about how the real range of this radio is basically a mile - make that a short mile. We have used this radio in a wide range of settings including the outerbanks with little cause of interference - and we get very poor range. Basically, when you are in range, you could yell at the other person and they could hear you. It's a VERY nice radio but it constitutes little more than a toy"
2,Not as good as T5210 and T5410,"With this model, you have to press the talk button in one very specific place with the tip of the thumb whereas before the pressure required to key the mic could easily be applied anywhere on the rubber switch covering.What this does is render these radios unusable in my opinion."
2,walkie talkies,We didn't care for these because they seem cumbersome to hold and talk. The channel selector is quite stiff. We get alot of interference using them. They do come with complete recharging accessories.We didn't use them right away or we would have returned them. We previously had a set of Cobra walkie talkies and they were much easier to use.
5,Cover,Fits perfectly I am so glad I found it. It goes well with my bowl and makes my processor usable.
3,Not for 3.5 stereo cable...,"I can't really leave much of a review since I could not make this work on my system. The part seems to be quality enough, but it did not do what I had expected...my fault for not doing my homework. Basically, this connector converts a standard optical cable signal to a 3.5 optical cable signal...you can literally see the optical light go in one side and come out the other side of the connector. It DOES NOT convert an optical cable signal to an analog stereo signal (like what you might plug into a set of headphones or computer speakers)."
4,"Tiny, inexpensive adapter","Just a little adapter but when you need something like this, there is no substitute. Typical radio/electronics stores charge too much for this type of thing. Price here was excellent."
3,"A lesser known guerrilla text, not extraodinary","Carlos Marighella wrote the Minimanual, and the emphasis should be on 'mini'. The emphasis is on the tactical level, it is heavy on techniques, but light on theory. Nothing innovative about it, and it offers no insight that cannot be gleaned from150 Questions For A Guerrilla,Guerrilla Warfare, or others.The only novel element was where he lists the seven sins of the guerrilla, basically inexperience, over-confidence, failure to maintain security (bragging), hubris, and hot-headedness. All valid points, but this must have been a tough sell, given the psychology of Latin American insurgents and their leadership.I'd only recommend this one if you've read every better known one first, and really felt a burning need to read another regardless of value.E. M. Van Court"
3,"Functional, but not like the picture","The coin changer appears to be a sturdy, well-built product. Being made in the USA, it is 3 times the cost of other, similar items. However, I am hoping that that extra cost is worth it in durability. What I'm not happy about is the dull, pot-metal look of the metal pieces. It is advertised as nickel-plated and looks nice and shiny. Mine looks like they forgot to nickel plate it. I guess I'm just picky."
2,clunky,"This changer is serviceable, but poorly made (sloppy joints and gaps ). It is heavy even not loaded with coins, and I would not look forward to having it hanging off my belt all day. Also, it is not useable in any configuration except hanging off one's belt ( it will not stand on its own on a flat surface )."
3,"Works well, not very pretty!","I purchased this from amazon about a week ago. It looks very shiny and pretty in the description, but when I received it, the metal looked very burnished (almost old and scratched up) and the plastic was rough and scratched in some places. At over 20$, I was quite disappointed with amazon. I decided to order another one, and talk to amazon, just in case the first one I got happened to be just a bad one in the lot. The second one I got was even worse looking. I will return one of them, and keep the other because I really need a coin sorter. I will say that this product is very sturdy and works for its intended use, hence the 3 stars, but it does not look as nice as the picture. And for its price, unless you REALLY need a coin sorter, or you don't care what it looks like, it's not worth it! You've been warned!"
4,McGill Money Changer,I purchased this item to use at Flea Markets when making sales. It performed excellent. I would highly recommend this product.
3,Looks cheap,"I am very disappointed in its appearance. I bought it as a gift and feel the recipient will look at it and think ""cheap."" On Amazon, it looks shiny and worth the price. Instead, it is dull and cheap looking. It looks like something from a discount store. Hopefully, the mechanism is better than the overall appearance."
5,coin changer,"I am a teacher and I have many classroom transactions that involve coins. This coin changer solved the problem of accepting coins and making change quickly. It is well made, and the kids get to see a technology that I grew up with used by my bus and street car drivers. Great product!"
5,I Love This Thing!,"I keep this coin changer in my car, to dispense change when I need it at toll booths, fast food drive-throughs, and parking meters. The capacity is excellent, it neatly holds lots of coins in every denomination (i.e. quarters, nickels, dimes, and pennies). Loading is easy and dispensing is quick. Of course, it is built like a tank and will probably last many lifetimes. My only recommendation to the vendor is that they make one without the belt loops and with a fitted, plastic, hard case for it so that it may be quietly and discreetly kept in an automobile glove box, etc."
4,Great little money changer . . .,"I have been wanting one of these for years. I carry it in the car for drive thru and toll change. Currently there are two things that are mildly bothersome: it is really heavy and when tipped over, sometimes the coins fall out. Now, that being said, both of those things will be resolved once I find a permanent place for it in my car. I do recommend this product and it is made well and offers a bit of nostalgia."
4,paraphrased scripture,"This book wasnt what I expected although it is a good ""translation"" of the book of Isaiah .The author used several sources including the dead sea scrolls. He is on an international translating team and is a good scholar. I would recommend this book for use in a paralell scripture study."
5,Exelent.,This book is so good. I don't regret one single penny I spent.it keeps you wanting more. Mary jane and Peter have a total huge conection. If you don't read it then you will never feel so good. Its on Task And teens can relate. Theres not alot of spiderman but there is alot of Peter. just look your self and check it out.
1,How Could MARVEL Allow This?,"Just reading the inside cover of this book is enough to make any Spider-Man fan, male or female, wince with almost physical pain. Now I agree that there aren't as many female comic book readers out there as many of us would like, but I'm a girl, and I love comics, especially Spider-Man, and I was horrified upon picking up this ""novel."" How could Marvel have let something as interesting, psychological, and respectable as Spider-Man be degraded into a simple teen romance novel? How could they have allowed charismatic, gorgous, strong Mary Jane to be transformed into an insecure, anorexic teen with a crush on ""popular"" Peter Parker? I am in awe that something I love and respect so dearly has been turned into something that makes sixth-grade girls giggle. My world has been turned upside-down. I have no more words for this travesty."
5,This book was great!,"The book Mary Jane is about a teenaged girl, named, Mary Jane Watson whose best friend is Peter Parker, a dorkey science geek. This story is about how Mary Jane and Peter have to work on a school science project together, and they try to figure out the formula to a new energy drink called OZ, that a kid in her school, Harry Osborne, dad's created. It also talks about the changes in her family and what she likes to do best ballet. My favorite part of this book is when Mary Jane is trying to steel the formula for OZ. I like this part because it is funny how she has to run back and forth through the different rooms in Harry'shouse. It is also funny when Harry decides to make a move on her, she knees him in the guy's sencitive area. I reccommend this book strongly, because it is full of adventures. It also has good parts and bad parts. I loved this book and I know others will too."
3,General coverage,"It is pretty easy to say that this is one of the best books on Volvo currently available, because I know of few others. That said, the book is only a broad-brush overview of the brand. There is little detail about any of the models, but the newer models (really everything from the 240 series onwards) are given very brief treatment. There isn't even enough in the book to be clear about the distinction between the 700 and 900 series. An earlier book (Volvo: A cavalcade 1927-2000) at least had production numbers for the 240 series, although it shared the same weakness of generality with this book. This is a good book for someone who wants a pleasant one-evening overwiew of Volvo cars. I wait for someone to write a badly-needed more substantial treatment of these wonderful cars."
2,Battery powered Lantern,"I was disappointed with this item. It appeared listed with camping items so I assumed it was for outdoor use, it is not. Although the lantern looks very attractive in the photo it is poorly made, has very sharp edges and did not fit together tightly. I returned the lantern, saved some money and went with the Coleman. Not as pretty but much more practical."
5,"Beautiful finish, bright lights!","The finish on this LED lamp is beautiful. With the six (!) D cell batteries installed, this lamp has a very solid look and feel to it. The light itself is very bright without being blinding and the dimmer allows for good control. In all, a well designed and built product."
2,Not worth it,This light looks great but is as useful as a nightlight. Would not recommend if you are in need of a bright light.
1,Less light than my penlight flashlight,"I am returning this lantern to the seller, because it did not produce any useful amount of light. I could not read by it, nor was it useful at all outside for group light or even to light my way down a path. However, according to the Amazon seller, it may just be a faulty product. Since I have bought from this seller before, I am going to try another when they get more in. I am hoping to be able to change my review to a more positive one at that point. Until then, the jury is still out."
3,Sturdy??,"I am suprised that this lantern feels a little crappy. I haven't try the light yet, but the make is not so solid. The top part of the lantern is jiggling and the shade part just stands loose as is. The access to the battery is not of the easiest nor self explanatory. The first time I tried to open it, I wasn't sure if I was breaking it or opening it...But bottom line, I have to try the light. If the light is good, then bingo, but for how long? - hope the product will last and not break down too quickly."
3,More stories needed,I wish the author had done stories about the IV/JG-27 in Greece 1943. I heard the Group was successful against both the RAF Beaufighter attack aircraft and the American P-38 Lighting which provided fighter escort for the Beaufighters. Could have done some more success stories about Italian pilots flying the ME-109 against the Allies.
1,Would Not Buy Again,"The product was highly overrated in my opinion... I was led to believe it would repair tears and holes easily and quickly, and TURN CLEAR! To my surprise, the product was much more of a liquid than a glue, soaked through several articles of clothing and caused white staining that almost made it look worse than the hole did in the first place.... I don't see how anyone found this product helpful. I would rather sew."
2,WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN,"Very difficult to use even for someone skilled in working on craft and sewing projects. If I were to have a rip in a really good piece of furniture or leather clothing, I would have it professionally repaired. I think these are beyond the amateur even if you think you are quite skilled."
2,It repaired but discolored the fabric,"I purchased this item for a repair on a brand new dress shirt that was ripped by a doorway jamb. It repaired the shirt, being white, but the repair was slightly tan. This shirt is not usuable in situations where impecability is required."
2,Too pricey for glue,There are a lot of cheap alternative at you local auto shop the are glue too but cheaper
5,Very good yaoi,"I'll say right off the bat, this yaoi was a little more explict then the ones I usually read. Having said that....I loved this volume. At first, Gerard really pissed me off, but through out the shorter stories his character was really given depth. I don't think anyone could dislike this guy after reading ""The Noble Woman"". And he's just so cute! Even with the scar.This is a fantastic yaoi that I would definetly recommend to anyone who likes this genre."
1,What is this?,Reading this book was a total waste of time. Nobody wants to read something that was written about something that happened so long ago. Personaly I don't know what was going through the author's mind as he stuck this massive confusion of words together and tried to call it a book.I will never again invest my time in reading a book writen by a clown like Donald Gordon Payne.
1,cookie-cutter prose and purple pretention abound,"eliot schrefer's first novel is written to appease the pretentious, shallow knuckleheads who delight in devil wears prada land, only screfer's pen lacks weisberger's vampiness. schrefer seems to have spent too much time with the sat: formulaic nincompoopishness has never been given a brighter spotlight, or a longer-lasting self-congradulatory pat on the back. if schrefer pumps out more books like this, we are going to start wanting books to be burned again."
1,"Pretentious, stale and poorly written","Sometimes, books with terrible covers make for great reads... but that's not the case here. The author of this novel refuses to accept that he's writing junk food, and so trusses up the plot with clumsy language. I don't think he's a natural writer--his style is very arch and forced. About midway through, once I realized that I had read the same story many times before, I put this aside. Jerky prose, thin characters, pretentious voice."
3,$395 an hour,"I got hooked into purchasing this book because I wanted to read how the main character got $395 for tutoring. Alas, $395 is how much the tutoring agency charges and is not the tutor's take home pay. This story reinforces my reasons for never wanting to be a bartender or perform customer service of any kind despite the financial rewards.I managed to get through this book more easily than I did Academy X which this title is linked to by Amazon. I think this book will encourage if not convince people to just be yourself and not want to be either the tutor or the people who can afford his services."
2,Well...,"I'm only about halfway through this, but I am struck that despite the fact that the author attended Harvard, he has no idea that Princeton has really fantastic financial aid--the main character would never have graduated eighty thousand in debt. Also, I have no sympathy for a Princeton grad in pre-recession New York who doesn't just go get a job in the financial sector for a year or two. The idea is brought up briefly, but sort of dismissed as an impossibility; getting any semblance of a real job would fix all of this guy's problems."
4,My first set of REAL chisels,"I had been using cheap Chinese made chisels for the pastfew years. For some reason this set caught my eye..Spentthe past couple of hours making a box for a single straightrazor using these chisels..I am very pleased. I was ableto do a side by side comparison with the inexpensiveHarbor Freight chisels... The Narex are a pleasure to use.Take an edge and hold it. I was working with western maple,not particularly hard, but quite tough..After sharpening the new chisels, I just started working the wood. Every nowand then I would pick up one of my 'old' chisels to compare.Both were sharpened exactly the same, but the Narex issubstantially superior...If you want a nice set of chiselsat a very reasonable cost,, buy these...you will like them.Jim in Gold Bar"
4,Way worth it,"Don't let the price fool you. I bought a set of these to keep as the ""beater"" set because of the price. But I am very surprised at the quality - they keep a very good edge. You'll use this as your ""good set."" Not great but very good, and certainly worth the price."
2,Do not stay sharp long,"I saw one other reviewer had similar problems to mine. I've found i can only work for about 5 minutes with these chisels (just cleaning out mortises in soft maple, or even just making mortises for door hinges) before they get ragged on the edge. I'm mystified by all the positive reviews both here and in ""Fine Woodworking"". I flattened the backs and sharpened the edge to a mirror shine right out of the box, but it gets really old having to resharpen them so often. Maybe i just got a bad set. Very disappointing."
3,You get what you pay for,"I'm not giving these two stars, despite the problems, since the price I paid for the entire set and case is equal to the cost of one or two expensive chisels.The bevel along the sides of the shanks is well-angeled for dovetails. Out of the box these seemed to have a pretty good edge, beveled at 35 degrees. When doing dovetails, however, they weren't sharp enough to cut soft maple well, but compressed the middle fibers, resulting in shoddy tails. Fortunately, this is hidden when the joint goes together. I sharpened the entire set on water stones (back and bevel)--starting with 220, finishing with 8000. After cutting another set of dovetails, I noticed the 12 and 16mm chisels were ragged, chipped from cutting poplar. My guess is it comes from lower quality, coarse-grained steel. IOW, contrary to the description, the steel is brittle. I just resharpened them again and they made it through another set of dovetails without chipping."
4,Boxed Bevel Edge Chisels Set/6,"Bought this as a gift for my husband who wanted to get started using hand tools for his wood projects. He was very impressed with the guality and thought they were a terrific buy for the price. He has not begun using them as yet, so time will tell how they are working out."
1,Bad design,Stay away from this unit. I purchase the e740 back in January of 2003 and it has not work right from day one. Toshiba has had it more then I have. Toshiba does not carry the unit on their site anymore. Makes you wonder why? The new PC 2003 OS is not available for the unit and product support is limited. I you have one backup you data as soon as you enter it.
2,"Good Wireless Features, Poor Reliability","I've owned the Toshiba e740 for several months now. I bought it to replace an iPAQ 3670 which needed an external 802.11b PC card to do wireless. (Very bulky.)The e704 is a reasonable attempt at a self-contained wireless PDA. With built-in 802.11b wireless (switchable in hardware and software to conserve battery life), it is a decent package. Much more compact than my Compaq iPAQ 3670 with an external 802.11b card.Unfortunately, the reliability is poor. The PDA kept loosing its memory forcing me to reinstall the backup software and restore the applications and PIM information. This was a major pain. Finally, the e740 stopped working all together. Push the power on button and nothing happens. The battery is fully charged, so it must be a failure in the PDA itself.Guess its back to the iPAQ 3670 for me!"
