3,COOL but not action-packed as Iron Eagle!!!,"Like many of you, I thought that this movie was gonna be the next Iron Eagle, a HI SPEED C.G. JET WAR with LOT'S of shooting and explotions, but NOOOOOO!!!!STEALTH is action-packed but not excactly as you think, The action scenes were EXPLOSIVE, FAST and COOL but very short (like 3 or MAYBE 4 minutes long) and just when you think that the action is gonna get better it get's interrupted by blah,blah,blah!, there are not much enemy jets to shoot at (it's more like jet chase), The story is VERY stupid and cheese, the acting wasn't good, and the C.G. special effects were cool but NOT first class.If you like ""fast jet action!"" then maybe this movie is for you, but if you like HI QUALITY EXPLOSIVE SHOOTING SPREE VEHICLE ACTION like Iron Eagle, The Losers or Death Race then search somewere else.Adios."
3,GOOD ACTION BUT NOTHING NEW,"Rob Cohen's thrilling, literally hi-octane, mostly airborne adventure STEALTH (Sony) was another summer box office disappointment. But this one deserves discovery on DVD for widescreenn action fans, even though it's pretty much by the numbers.Set in the very near future, a navy fighter jet with a computer pilot develops a mind of its own during practice maneuvers. Human pilots, who at first seem less intelligent and armed, are sent up to stop the AI jet from starting a nuclear global war.Stupendous, thrilling, ultra photo-realistic action never lets up. And the viewer is whipped around at supersonic speeds in an ultimate thrill ride. This one is much better than I imagined and the four plus hours of highly watchable extras are as good as the feature. Especially memorable is the intelligent, creative, almost spiritual portrait of director Rob Cohen."
3,Knight Rider in the Sky with Malice,"This was an action film with lots of eye candy. It was neither a great film, nor a bad one. The movie pits 3 navy fighter pilots against an artificial intelligence plane, whose voice sounded like Kitt. Remember Knight Rider? There was minimal plot, just enough to connect the action scenes together (I have definitely seen worse in this area). Some of the Navy and plane footage was really great to see. Also, you gotta love a tough chick, and the girl pilot was really good at that. The dialogue was trite and predictable, and some of it had me laughing. Not because it was comedy, but because it was supposedly serious. The womanizing efforts of the guy pilots were the worst of that. If you are looking for a mindless action flick, this one is worth renting once."
4,Computer Ego Boost,"How many movies, even as far back as the 50's, have explored the possibility of computers becoming ""aware"" and exerting their power over the mortals? A lot! Stealth is a fun, exciting, not too over the top techno film about a military super secret fighter jet that can do everything a human can't or won't. The extraordinarily beautiful Jessica Biel is the real hero of this flick and you really care about her outcome after a terrifying bailout over North Korea. Not to give the plot away, but she gets some help in the end. I repurchased this movie from Amazon after my original copy vaporized (my kids will not take responsibility for its disappearance) and found it as entertaining as before. The set has an exceptional amount of special features and the picture quality is outstanding."
3,Great special effects and fast planes but.......,"This is one of those movies which is visually slick and has great special effects - but lacks any real heart or chemistry with its actors. Its obviously had a lot of money spent on the movie and the sets and technology looks really good. However, in some ways it tries to pack too much in and there's so much emphasis on the technology that the people in the story come off second best - they are all too good at what they do and too unbelievably pretty to be real.If you are after a popcorn movie and love fast planes and good special effects then this is for you - but for movies about prototype machines which go bad other vintage movies like BLUE THUNDER have done the same thing better."
1,BAd,"This miovie has just the concept of I, Robot and other robot movies. Sure, we might like the terminator series, but as years passes by, we do the same thing over and over again.If you watched other robot movies, You would see a pattern over and over again. first, the robot was the hero, and then it became the enemie. Get a life, people!!! Why would the robots turn bad suddenly without do good stuff first? why must they follow this rule again and again and again?!!!!!!that's why I hate this movie, even though i didn't watch it."
1,boring,I can't remember seeing the end of it cause I got bored and I didnt want to waste any more of my precious time.The only good thing about it is that I saw it in Blu-ray.
2,CRAP!,"**SLIGHT SPOILER**CRAP! Really, this movie is a good idea, BUT......you have the hot chick, the dude she used to sleep with, but are now not an item, but work together (yeah right, in this day and age?) and are really still in love, and then you have the token, comic relief black dude who gets killed way too early in the movie. WHY JAMIE FOXX, WHYYYYY?! It totally meets the formula for almost every Hollywood, action, special effects movie that has come out since we realized computers can make fake things look real. The special effects are really good though, the acting - not bad considering what they had written for them, but how many of these movies will be made before people finally quit going to see them? If you've seen one Jerry Bruckheimer movie, then you've seen this movie, trust me. I give a 2 star rating only because of the actors and special effects and how good the story could have been. It's worth a rent, but you'll wish you had those 2 hours of your life back."
2,"Typical ""Hollywood Military"" movie","Stealth had a huge budget for special effects that apparently left no money for a storyline. In this piece of fiction the ""top"" pilots in the United States Navy appear to have no ability to follow orders, and have a huge aversion to killing the enemy (never good if you are at war). Finally, the love story...if you can call it that...is so forced that I think the leading man (or leading woman, or both) must have been uninterested in the opposite sex, because there was nothing between them except the contract to get the movie completed. All in all, I gave this movie 2 stars, because the technical advisor had some good taste in weapons (at least someone working on this film had some taste)."
2,I Liked the First 30 Minutes and Jessica Biel...YUM,"I expected to hate this movie due to the harsh reviews and I pretty much got just that. The only saving grace from this tired dialogue, sometimes decent SFX, and little to no plot at all, is Jessica Biel. She looks hot and held my eye's attention throughout. Wait for Stealth to hit DVD and it will very soon. And this coming from someone who rarely gives a movie less than 3 stars."
1,This movie is terrible and blu-ray doesn't make it any better,"I'm a huge fan of military aircraft, which is really the only reason I went to see it and, I'll admit, the airplanes were cool and they really stand out on an HD TV, (not to mention that Jessica Biel is really hot in a flight suit) but the story and acting is so bad, and much of it utterly pointless, that I was almost sick to my stomach after watching it. I just don't understand how these writers get a job in the first place. The only conclusion I've been able to come to is that their names are drawn from hats, but I just don't know. Like I said, the planes are really cool, but PLEASE spare yourself two hours and find some clips/pics of the planes online and be happy with that. Avoid this movie at all costs!"
1,Promising plot is blown,"Too bad. There were some elements of this movie that could have been developed into a good movie. But instead the plot is almost amaturish. The movie is basically a series of corny stereotypes that are played out one after the other. For example, the writers missed some great chances to develop the relationship of the robot with the pilots. The ending was awful."
1,Good old classic plots put through a meat grinder.,"Rob Cohen & WD Richter put ""2001 A Space Odyssey"", ""Wargames"", ""Short Circuit"", and ""Top Gun"" into a blender. They also included great shots of Jessica Biel in a hot blue bikini. Later her uniform pants seem to turn into black pantyhose. Get someone to remove some stills form those scenes for you, and you'll have the best parts of this movie. Because it has nothing else to offer at all. 0 stars."
3,Not so Great,"i was very excited when i went to see this film. however, i was shockingly dissappointed. the film seemed to lack a very good plot and the actors did not deliver such a great performance as i had hoped. this film could have been much better if it had not been so predictable."
2,Only Reason to watch is Jessica Biel,"I cannot describe this movie with out getting into profanity so I will just be general.Jessica Biel is the only redeeeming quality about this film.1st the government only built 3 of these super planes. I call BULL$&!*. Anyone who has dealt with the Government PRocurement process will agree with me.2nd, I could have suspended disbelief until the whole floating unmanned gas stations. Seriously. Utter Garbage.3rd, the whole Frankenstein's monster crossed with Short Circuit's Johnny 5 with a redemption motif smacks of numerous rewrites or network ""notes"" being done during filming.As I said at the beginning, Jessica Beil is the only part of this worth seeing."
3,[...],"I saw this moview when it just came out. Yesterday I bought the dvd. After buying it and seeing it again, I think it is as good as when I first saw it. It is no doubt a popcorn film, but really entertaining. [...] It is made to look like a demolition explosion, droPped precisely to cause little damage from surrounding areas. Pay attention guys!!!!If you are looking for a fun movie from beginning to end get the dvd. The special effects are really photo-real. It is even better then STAR WARS in photo-real quality.you can not tell that those planes landing on the carrier are CGI AT ALL!"
1,Hunk of Junk,This movie was a hunk of junk. Josh Lucas is not a leading man. Jamie Foxx plays a stereotype. Jessica Biel looks good but that is about all the whole movie has going for it. The story is moronic and not even done well. The action is stupid and sub par.I can't recommend this movie at all. It harkens back to the days of 80's trash like Top Gun which looks like an academy award winner compared to this hunk of junk.
2,Crappy movie but good FX,"The trailer of this flick was pretty good so I watched it... few minutes after I started to see the movie I thought-> good movie, a little while later I knew I was wrong!The action was not all bad. Special effects were really good.It's kind of weird seeing Jamie Foxx playing an air-force guy his gole is to be in big blockbuster movies now since his role in ""Ray""."
1,YUCK!,"Turned it off after 10-15 minutes. Horrible acting. Pure cheese, like most else coming out of Hollywood."
3,Whatever - Spoiler Warning!,jessica biel is hot. josh lucas isn't THAT cute & jamie foxx dies. there are fast planes & smart robots. that's it...it could have been soooooo much better.
1,Unbelieveably Horrable,"This is one of the worst movies ive seen in a heck of a long time. I couldnt watch all of it (and I watched all of Land Of The Dead). This movie was unbelievable to an extreme extent. I mean for one, they have one of those standard scrawny techy geeks that every sci fi movie has, but what the hell is he doing on an aircraftcarrier! He's not in the frikn nNavy. They have Navy jobs for specific stuff like that, they dont bring some civilian on there. And why is the control room all neoned out. What the hell. And this is the little stuff. But this movie sucks. And this comming from someone that likes dumb movies."
1,Gobble Gobble,"This pile deserves negative stars.It is not that I have trouble with the premise of cybernetic unmanned combat aerial vehicle or artificial intelligence. What bugs me is the action starts over Pakistan, and the pilot low on fuel punches out over North Korea. The other one gets his tanks topped off somewhere over the Indian Ocean and makes it to Alaska after a dogfight in Russia. Huh? Did anyone bother to check a map or consider the limited range of a modern fighter in full afterburner?Of course the AI goes nuts and out flies and out fights the other three pilots. Considering these worthies have a collective IQ around 30 you shouldn't be terribly surprised.Skip this turkey at all costs."
1,"I know why they called it ""Stealth""...","...because you shell out hard earned money to be entertained buying into the hype and when you're not looking they sneak this garbage into the theaters. The acting is aweful, the dialog is repulsive, the plot...well there isn't one really, and the special effects are computer generated and not really that special. In fact, they had to fill up the plot with a mini vacation that doesn't even fit into the storyline just so they could show pretty people in bathing suits...I can see more than that on-line for free if I really get the urge. Typical American brainwashing...a rank of 1 star is generous...the concept is good and it could have been a decent sci-fi, military, action flick in the right hands."
1,Want to waste 2 hours of your life - ignore this review !!,"If you have bothered to read all the other reviews here, i think you will get the point, but still unsure ?Think of KNIGHTRIDER from the 70`s ( i`m sure EDI used the same voice !! ) then add some THUNDERBIRD puppets ( thats a bit mean, at least they had personality ) then add a dash of C.G.I. on a budget, oh and not forgetting that the whole script was written by a seven year old!A bit scathing you may feel - but deservedly so i`m afraid.Seriously, watch some paint dry for a couple of hours, at least the fumes will give you some sort of a buzz."
2,Jessica Biel,"The actors here are known to be good. This movie, however, is pretty bad. Seeing the actress Jessica Biel in the bikini is worth every bit of the 2 stars!! What a body! Whew! My my my... she must work out.Watch the movie to see that one part, not for the lame 2001--->Hal, Top Gun, Firefox, etc. rip-off this movie was made from."
1,Really No Need To Waste Your Time,"For all of five minutes, this movie has some promise. Then it de-evolves into a tepid nightmare of one-after-another action sequences lacking context or emotional resonance or even skillful construction. Simply put: this is a mish-mash of things you've seen before now done remarkably less well. Someone else noted that this picture was penned by cult-favorite Buckaroo Bonzai scribe, but don't expect that pedigree to be a hallmark of quality here. Of the twelve critic reviews posted on Netflix, the highest (3 STARS) by Brian Webster of the Apollo Guide said: ""A technical marvel, but an uninvolving failure at an emotional level."" The worst (0 STARS - which is supposed to be impossible) by Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said: ""The stars are asked to chew on the driest of technobabble, and to strike poses of flyboy and flygirl moxie that make them look callow rather than heroic."" So, I think I can safely say: ""This movie is a waste of your precious life."""
1,Where were the adults when they made this movie?,"Several times I stopped this movie - it was so poorly made I thought it not worth the aggravation to continue watching. However, my curiosity got the better of me. I wanted to see how the director would finally end this terribly made film.I don't understand how intelligent investors would sign off on a film so poorly scripted and with such terrible acting.Jaime Foxx was a joke. His agent did him a big disservice by having him take the role of a stereotypical jive-talking, pussy hungry, black. I was actually glad when he got killed off.I like action movies that entertain. I like action movies that will allow me to suspend my disbelief for an hour or so. What I don't like are action movies that are so focused on special effects that they lose all sight of what the story is about.I really shouldn't complain. I paid less than US$1 for the video. I will throw this DVD in the trash."
2,Such a waste,"Boy talk about unfulfilled potential. This movie was it. A good cast wasted and a good idea put into a brainless plot. Sam Shepard made a good effort as always but he could not save this movie. Jamie Foxx also was doing a good up until he got killed in such a way you had to see it coming long before it happened. Let's see, what can I do that I know I shouldn't that will undoubtedly result in my death? Then he does it. Paleeeeze. Jessica Biel gets shot by the high powered rifle of a sniper then manages to cross 5 miles of rugged terrain to get rescued. There is nooooo way. Anyway, if you just want to watch some kind of cool aerial acrobatics done on computers, this is an okay film. Forget the plot, forget the acting. Do that and you can tolerate this one, although it had the potential to be so much more."
3,Fun movie,"This film reminded me of an anime I saw several years ago about a UCAV that became sntient and went rogue. This put a different spin on the story and is a fun movie for a rainy day. While not Acadamy award amterial it is worth a viewing. Sure the charecters are kind of predictable but one can forgive that as the flight sequences are where at the core the film succeds unlike ""Top gun"" that actually somehow manged to make combat flight boring. This makes it exciting as the split second timing is reflected in them. The planes actually give the impression of hurtling through the skies at high speed instead of plodding along.Again it's fun a good bucket of popcorn film what more can one want from an action film?"
3,three and 3/4 stars overall and four stars for action,"Despite all the drubbing this film got from the critics, I didn't think it was so bad. I was expecting an action movie with fast, military planes and that's what I got - with some other plot bits thrown in. Who cares if there was the obligatory ""lets get everyone into swimsuits"" scene - with this cast, it was bound to happen. At least there was no gratuitous sex scene. The action was very good and the plot was certainly not bad. I've see way, way more terrible movies which got great reviews. People are taking this movie too seriously. Just watch it and enjoy it. Plus, the soundtrack/score is excellent."
4,Blu-Ray version,"Okay I am not going to bother reviewing the content as such, suffice to say that it is a futuristic idea of what the armed forces may look like.The Blu-Ray version of this movie is definitely one to showcase this format the colour renditioning is superb and PQ is second to none. I would have given this 5 stars but I felt the audio, as is often the case with BD titles, let the production down. Not to say that it was bad but more that it could have been better."
2,Not bad,"Overall this is a great baby-making CD....sounds a lot like Jodeci's ""the show, the after party, the hotel"", with a little Mario, Stevie Wonder, Brian McKnight, Babyface mix. Its a typical young R & B album."
4,I have heard better but all in all it is pretty good.,"There are two songs I like on this above the rest of them. ""Anonymous"" and ""Turn the page"". The rest of the c.d. has good songs but to me those are the standouts. It is worth buying. Something good to listen to with your lady."
3,yawwwwnnnn,"Maybe this one just has to grow on me, but to me it sounds like one big song. All the tracks pretty much sound the same, and it's pretty much nothing new, different, or original about it. I think ""lame"" might be the word. But maybe I just have to get used to it, but I'm kinda regretting this purchase at the moment."
5,Real R&B is slowly coming back,"After months of delays, Bobby Valentino returns with a worthy follow up to his good debut released two years earlier. Mr. Valentino once said that he was going to save R&B and with this release, Mr. Valentino may be right. His vocals are stronger on this CD which was apparent last year when he released his first single Turn The Page. Valentino vocals also soar on the somber Home Is Where You Belong, his strong cover of Babyface's classic Soon As I Get Home and the sure fire baby maker Over & Over. The CD also has it's share of up tempo club tracks including Ridin, Checkin For Me and the smash Anonymous. My only compliant is that Bobby cut two of the hottest tracks. The amazing slow jams Wreck and Our Love that surfaced on the net earlier this year. All in all a good album and I can't wait to hear what he has for us next."
5,Great album,This album is definitely how r&b should be represented! You can truly just pop the cd in and let it play all the way through. There are also a lot of songs that will help set the mood which is always a plus!
2,"Occasion, Yes...Special, No","With his sophomore effort, Bobby Valentino comes up short in his delivery of a classic R&B album. While the CD isn't a complete flop, there's nothing ""special"" about the ""occasions"" he sings for the duration of 16 tracks. This guy has the potential to reach the status of a classic crooner but for some reason he falls short of achieving this title. I'll stay tuned for future projects to see if he can attain this goal."
3,What is Bobby V.Tino???,"This is CD is really JUST okay. It has some catchy beats, but the lyrics are reworks from what I've already heard from other singers. It just seems like people that have been in the game for awhile should have more mature lyrics. Like I said, the beats are pretty good, but when I listen closely to his lyrics I get irritated. He says Bobby V.tino in most of his lyrics and that is so juvenile to me."
5,BEST CD From DTP,"This was a great c.d. Bobby came thru with his sophmore album...He should get alot of respect from this one... Seeing that he wrote a majority of the songs, I say he has a raw talent for this.. Rearview Ridin should be his next single.. Overall Great c.d. cant wait for the next one..HOPEFULLY I WILL BE ABLE TO HELP....HOPEFULLY.!!"
1,CD could have been better.,He got a little fame and left his best behind. Only 2 good songs on the whole cd.
1,Can you say CASHING IN?,We were looking forward to more adventures with Olivia. What we got was illustrations stolen from the original Olivia book and no new content whatsoever. Shame on this author for using the wonderful reputation of his first two books to make a fast buck off of Olivia's fans.
4,I love the Character,However just a numbers book and nothing to read. Of Course the book is called Olivia Counts and not she Counts and Reads!
4,nice book,"nice, and we love olivia, but it was a tiny bit of a letdown because this is mostly just regurgitated drawings from the original olivia book paired with numbers 1-10. nevertheless, if you can find a cheap copy, it's a fine addition to a kid's book collection."
3,Olivia counts a great book for children,"I think that ""Olivia counts"" is a great book for children under 2-3 years. I'm a huge fun of Ian Falconer, I love all Olivia's books. This one is a different kind, it teaches your kids to learn how to count, but with the beautiful pictures of Olivia and the great creativity of Ian Falconer."
4,We have an OLIVIA to read this too...,So she is absolutely intrigued everytime you mention her name (12 mos). This is a cute counting book that holds her attention (primarily because of the color scheme I'd imagine)...and by the last page when we are counting the Olivia's....she's just delighted!
5,Great boardbook for babies/toddlers!,We got this and the original Olivia book at my daughers first birthday party and I must say they started the Olivia obsession! My daughters book case is now lined with Olivia books. She is now almost 3 and still prefers Olivia books to all others. Great purchase for the little ones!
2,Not the Greatest Spanish Textbook,"This book was ok, but it really wasn't the greatest Spanish Textbook. I felt like the illustrations were cheesy and geared towards elementary students instead of college students (I took this course as a junior in college). I've had other Spanish textbooks that have been better. If you have to have it for class, it's not a complete waste, I just didn't enjoy it."
1,Sun Lamp,I plugged this lamp in. It worked for 2 minutes and then stopped working. I contacted Bell & Howell. They told me to mail them the cord and they'd mail me a replacement lamp but that was 2 months ago. It still hasn't come.
5,fantastic!,Thets why this is my second one. the light is clear with no yellow and bright as sun. Perfect for older eyes
4,"Ribald, Revolting...and Revealing","First, let it be clear that this book is the sophmoric stories of a self-professed lazy bum egomaniac and half of it is probably fabricated.Second, let it be clear that after my twenty years in medicine and having many friends in the pharm. industry, there is nothing in this book that strikes me as not potentially true, and much of it is most certainly true. This will be regarded as perplexing and/or infuriating to many not in the industry and probably quite a few doctors.Third, this is a really funny book that has all kinds of ""Oh yea, been there before"" moments for anyone in the industry. Despite my disapproval of his personal and business ethics, this is a good read."
3,An OK diversion from my real life,"An interesting book about the life of a ""drug rep"". I knew a bit about this career before reading it, but now I feel like I have lived it. There was less Viagra humor than I anticipated, but more career discussion.While I generally enjoyed this book, it seemed to end rather abruptly without drawing any conclusions."
5,"Excellent Book, now I know why everyone wants to be a rep","Book was excellent. I now know why my co-pays keep going up.It is a great look into an industry that looks straight forward, but in fact is quite complex."
2,Hard Sell,This writer was never a salesperson. He is not much of a writer either. I don't believe half of the experiences and feel he loves to try and make himself important.
4,Accurate and amusing,"I have some familiarity with pharma industry sales and this book depicted the experience quite well. The author is a good writer and the book was an easy, fun read. I laughed out loud about a dozen times."
3,you think national health care is bad?,Perhaps a lesson in how drug companies make too much money might be enlightening. Wasted. A society that develops drugs that sell before drugs that cure. Some humor. A lot of head scratching.
2,A Disappointing Read,"This book had the potential to be very good but in the end, it is quite average. The author's worst enemy is himself. For some unknown reason, Reidy feels the need to make some sort of joke or wisecrack once every six sentences. This interrupts the flow of the story and, most importantly, the jokes quit being funny around Page 12. And on top of that, the constant attempts at humor create a sense that the author is lying about many things.I am not sure why Reidy felt the need to constantly make jokes (self-deprecating and otherwise) but it absolutely ruined the entire story. After a while, you will begin to think he is making up half the stories he tells. In all, a very disappointing read."
1,Too much about the vets and not enough about animals,I found this book disappointing. The book dwelt on the vets more than the helping of animals. I couldn't care less about the vets' lives.
5,The BEST horror/suspense/dramedy EVER!!!,"Gary Busey is perfect as the main insane character! Mimi Rogers is so believable! But the most kudos go to Michael McKean - he does it all! Comedy, Spinal Tap, drama... You have to see this if you're a McKean fan...or even if you've never heard of any of these people, SEE THIS MOVIE!"
5,Right on par,"I wasn't an ATB fan before but I had discovered 'Long way home' through Pandora and it just filled my soul so much that I had to get the song. After sampling the rest of the cd, I decided to buy it and haven't been disappointed. It's in constant rotation on my playlist with the following track ranks:5 Stars: Long way home, I don't wanna stop, Don't stop4 Stars: Long way home (orig mix), trilogie pt. 2, Ecstasy, Hold you, Let u go,3 Stars: Humanity, Let U go (reworked), believe in me, take me over, here with me, marrakech, In love with the DJ, You're not alone, 9pm Till I come, Believe in me (DJ Atoine)and the other 5 tracks are 2 stars.That's a pretty good ratio for a 17 track cd. Definitely worth it!"
2,I Didn't Get It,"I'm relatively new to the dance scene and I have heard a lot of hype about ATB so I finally picked up this cd figuring a greatest hits would be the way to go. I understand that ATB is a vocal trance artist but I have a massive complaint: it seems like the ONLY thing that makes ATB distinctive is his use of vocals. If the vocals were stripped away from the music we would be left with boring fills and substandard beats. I'm not saying that it is bad because it has vocals, I'm saying that all it has are vocals. I became bored quickly with most of the songs. The only highlights to me were: Ectascy and 9 P.M. I'm hoping that I just didn't get it and need to hear some of his other work to understand and appreciate ATB. But until I do I'm going to list this as massively disappointing."
4,A Good Compilation,"You know how it is, you hear just one song and it stays at the forefront of your mind. Now I'm not talking about those songs that are annoying and make you want to get back at the person who made you remember it or played it for you. I'm talking of a real creative piece of music that strikes a cord in your soul.ATB's song ""Ecstasy"" did that to me. I came across it while watching a video on YouTube and had to have the song. Now normally I don't purchase a CD for just one song, I usually have a three song rule. But with this album I took a chance, and found a great selection of music on there. This CD quickly made it into my car as one of the top ones I listen to while driving, and I have added tracks to MP3 player to listen to while I exercise. I plan to add more music from ATB to my music collection. With what I have heard from them so far I don't see how I could go wrong."
3,The Swamp,"The opening has our author reading to schoolchildren from her book, ""The Swamp"", surprisingly the movie is called ""The Marsh"". When the author finds out there is in fact a house like the one she saw in her dreams to write about in her book, things start to become spooky. She ends up finding and renting the house. Not long after a local newspaper man is interested in what she is doing in their town. Then a paranormal investigator joins her in exploring the odd events she is seeing at the house. A reasonably decent ""Poltergeist"" type thriller. Certainly worth at least a rental. Good DVD quality and decent replayability. Good for most the family. May cause nightmares for the small ones."
4,Good Ghost Story,"This really is a good ghost story... not a 'things that go bump in the night' through the whole movie like others (Messengers for example).The plot continues to develop throughout the movie, and if you can predict the ending of this, then you are pretty intuitive. It was quite a surprise ending.I really enjoyed it."
5,Huge asset in helping me pass,"This book is great. Walker covers the material in a compelling, funny, and crystal-clear way that makes the boatload of material necessary to pass the 65 comprehensible. There is out-of-place political commentary, and the repeated catchphrases sometimes wear thin, but these are small minuses in an otherwise superb study aid. I got the book a week before the test, studied my brains out, and passed easily."
2,there are much better options,The style of the writing in the book is very well characterized by the cartoon on the front (I.e. less than professional). I wound up purchasing both this and the Kaplan Series 65 package that came with a CD question bank. The Kaplan book was a far better tool to prepare. I passed the first time.
4,Everyday Language for Complicated Stuff,"Mr. Walker definitely has enthusiasm for the material, which is fantastic because it could be very dull otherwise. His sense of humor keeps a reader engaged in complicated, sometimes dry subjects. I think he explains things very well.Sometimes his banter is a little much but I highly recommend this book if you want to have a strong understanding of the concepts covered in the 65. Maybe this review should be taken with a grain of salt though because I haven't actually taken the test yet!"
2,"Necessary material, but too much attitude","Having just successfully completed the 65 today, I can say the test material is reasonably covered, though I was thankful I had my CFP exam studies and some free on-line tutorials to fall back on.As many people have commented, there is 'humor' scattered throughout the book. This does help liven up what could be a dry topic, but many times I found myself wanting to scream- 'Enough already, its not necessary to have some smart-a**, sarcastic comment in every paragraph'. It got to a point where the sarcasm was a distraction and actual impediment to me getting the actual material I needed from the text.Its apparent the author knows the material in depth. However he just has a bit too much attitude for my taste."
3,Not sufficient if you don't already know enough,"I don't believe there is any one single preparation material out there that covers everything that could be on the exam. And this book is no exception.My opinion: this book covers about 70% of the material on the exam. So if you learn everything in the book or if you are already have experience of the industry, you might just know enough to pass the exam. If you want to be more certain in passing the test on the first shot then get ""Series 65 Uniform Investment Adviser Law Exam"" plus its simulation exams on CD. The computer-based practice exams are very helpful. The book has a better index and explainations that are short and to the point. Although dryer to read, the book covers more grounds (~80%) than Mr. Walker's."
2,Keeps dry material interesting but didn't prepare me for the 65,"Although the book engages you enough to get through some fairly boring material, it just isn't detailed enough as a stand-alone study guide for the Series 65. I never even finished it because I didn't learn enough to do decently on the practice tests from the more serious vendors (STC, Kaplan). Read this if you want to learn some general concepts but I do not recommend relying on it as a serious study tool."
2,Not advanced at all!,"I spent a year in Latin America and was looking for something to provide me with reinforcement of advanced grammatical concepts and listening and speaking practice. I couldn't believe how basic these CD's are--definitely not advanced. They were useless for me, and I gave them to my husband who has only taken one continuing-education-type Spanish classe, and has learned mostly through listening to me and through a couple of trips abroad. They were great for his level (beginner-intermediate)."
2,Misleading Title,"As many others have commented, this is indeed intermediate. The first CD actually says, ""Welcome to the Spanish Intermediate Series."" Another thing I noticed is that most of the listenings are spoken by a woman who is not actually a native speaker. Her accent is OK and she clearly knows the language but, my god, why not hire a native speaker? There are native speakers who do the ""real life"" situational dialogues, and they are quite good. But most of the time you're listening to her. Luckily I checked this out from the local library for free and promptly returned it.It doesn't seem badly put together but if you're looking for an advanced audio course, this isn't it. Try Living Language's Ultimate Spanish Advanced. It's MUCH better."
2,Not very advanced,This product is just ok. I have been speaking spanish for about 3 years now daily because it is my wife's native language and I was hoping that this product would be more advanced in that it covered the more difficult verb conjugations and maybe some sayings that don't translate well. It covers very basic spanish in my opinion and I was not even able to continue with all of the CD's because it was very boring. The best program I have found for more advanced audio lessons is Learning Spanish Like Crazy. Put your money towards that.
2,Stinko,"Uniformly bad acting, cheesy special effects and poorly matched stock footage make this '80s Made-For-TV movie campy if nothing else."
3,disappointing,"Had I read this book years ago, I would be raving about it. However, most of it detailed incidents that have been discussed, written about, and reported on ad nauseum. Otherwise, it was a good book. The writing was excellent."
2,For those desperate phone calls ten hours in the future.,"If this device were a gymnast it would have slipped awkwardly off the pommel horse, ripping its leotard, and cracking its leg on the dismount. I thought this was the niftiest thing in town when I bought it. I display its coiled exterior prominently on my desk hoping other dorks would marvel and admire it. My phone, which was off during the ""charging"", had gone from two bars to a mind-numbing, brown-out inducing, three bars after 9+ hours. Data: the USB port charging it was directly off the motherboard with no other devices daisy-chained to it or connected to the other port. This same phone and battery go from nothing to fully charged after 45 minutes on the AC.It works in the tightest of pinches, but it's a disappointing performance."
5,Stylistique comparée du franais et de l'anglais,This is a real good book the French version of which they use in french grad school with two workbooks and a teacher's answer key it is good but kind of esoteric and obscure to the layman. It depends on if you know Saussure and some other famous linguists' models from the 40's and 50's so it's pretty good for a graduate level stylistiques course.
2,"Adequate for movies, poor for music.","This home theater system is another in a long line of extremely mediocre products from RCA. I purchased a slightly older version of it before I knew anything about home theater. The sound for movies, with dolby digital from a DVD player, is satifactory. You can hear the voices, and most action is reproduced fairly well. The speakers are woefully inadequate when it comes to music. They are made out of cheap, thin wood and just decent materials.Pros:*Does an adequate job of movie sound when fed a Dolby Digital signal from a DVD player.Cons:*Terrible for music*Cheap construction*Only 50 Watts per channel, and that is probably a generous rating."
2,Walsh is almost there,What a great band! Its a shame Steve Walsh is the vocalist..his intonation is so flat this becomes hard to listen to!Awesome guitarist..and killer songs!Steve Walsh almost has it..I dont nknow why they didnt use some studio trickery to get him in tune.
1,old school,i hope the author of this book has mature. it was recommend to me. i found it hard to read. it appears that you spend all your time doing instead of being. again i am sure she has grown beyond this kind of ideology.
4,An important survey of women's spirituality,"I bought this book for research, and it more than met my expectations. In fact, I couldn't put this book down until I'd read it cover-to-cover! Ms. Teish weaves a compelling first-person story, balanced with rituals and work.Whether you're a woman looking for spiritual answers in a confusing and conflicted world, an historian surveying cross-cultural religious traditions, or a beginner curious about the spiritual options of Voudou, this book is tremendous and worth looking for. It's a page-turner, no matter what your background and interests."
4,A book that started me on my path,"I originally purchased this book back in the early 90's when I was just getting involved in my African culture. I am African-American and anything affiliated with my ancestry, I wanted to know about. Although this book isn't really traditionally Yoruba (which I am now), it will introduce African spirituality to those who are a bit leery of investigating this beautiful religion. The memoirs of Iya Teish are wonderful and she really opens you up to the possibility of magic. I work in a bookstore and I frequently reccomend it to young black women on a spiritual quest."
5,"A wonderful, informative book for the beginner","I went to the book store to find a book on the Yoruba religion the store clerk suggested Jambalaya. The book is easy to follow and gave me more information on the truth of voodoo, Goddesses, and ancestral reverence than I ever thought possible. A must read for the beginner."
2,A plain CD,"I was not very fond of Drum & Bass music, however I really like electronic music and I have listen a few other D&B artist, thus I purchased this CD mainly because it was on sale (less than $8 bucks)and because I have a lot of respect for the DJ-KICKS series, but sadly, I must admit that I was very dissapointed with what I heard in comparison with my expectation, and this is because this London DJ female-good looking-Duo did not moved my feet an inch. I was expecting some variety but the result was always the same, not highs and not lows, always the same plain and boring beat and that was really dissapointing. Probably I will need to heard them live or in the Dance floor, but my personal opinion this CD does not paid honour to what Kemistry & Storm can probably do."
1,Well I bought it.... and now I'm selling it right back!,"The same beat throughout the entire CD with barely any difference between one track and the next. Truly I must have been on drugs when I bought it, encouraged by all these 5 star reviews, but now - the morning after, for which there is no pill - that I' m sober and I pledge not to take any more drugs and (please congratulate me and organize a parade in celebration) have checked into a rehab center, I would like to get rid of this overrated album, most likely given great reviews by either people who want to turn it into cash (truth be damned!), or truly believe this is a great piece of work out of loyalty and honoring the memory of DJ Kemistry, who was tragically and bizarrely killed by a flying pavement marker. (look it up in Google)"
5,Information Update,"I am writing this information here because I found the reviews of the DCRIP-5 at Amazon.com's site helpful when I was considering the purchase of the camcorder. It is a great camcorder because it overcomes the one obstacle that people encounter when they want to record something in their life on video tape. That obstacle is the bulkiness of most camcorders, which makes using them a major preduction. The DCRIP-5 fits in a pocket. You can carry it with you anywhere with no hassle at all. It is about the size of a digital still camera.Today I installed Pinnacle's Studio 8DV, the software that Sony recommends for use with their Micros DV camcorders. It works great and there is an update available at the Pinnacle web site to allow Micro DV users to capture video directly from the camcorder.I recommend this combination, the DCRIP-5 and Pinnacle's Studio 8DV to anyone who wants no hassle video taping and computer editing."
1,Please sign petition requesting Sony support MicroMV on Mac,5 stars when they support MacsPlease sign the petition http://www.petitiononline.com/osxmicmv/ requesting that Sony support MicroMV camcorders on Mac OS X.
2,"small size, poor video quality","I really like the small size, easy to take anywhere. I was hoping to download the video to my computer & burn a DVD-R of my video. Movieshaker (included) is the ONLY software to date that works with this camera. You can export video from movie shaker in several formats so you can import into Pinnacle,Ulead,etc. Problem is the video quality is rather poor, especially if fast moving object in video.I do not recommend this camera."
1,"Not what it promises, SHAME ON SONY","This is a neat little gadget that is totally useless. The mpeg2 format is a Sony proprietary format that is different than regular mpeg. You cannot upload the movies onto your computer and there is no software support other than the enclosed ""Movieshaker"" that is horrible. Sony tech support is horrible...."
1,"If you want to burn DVDs with your video, avoid this.","I have bought a lot of Sony products over the years so when I was in the market for a camcorder I foolishly just picked this up without researching it. After recording four tapes of my one year old I tried making a DVD and after 20-30 hours and using 3 programs, including Sony's Movieshaker (constant crashes) I have still been unsuccessful. I have just ordered a well reviewed Panasonic camera in DV. MicroMV is a terrible product with zero support from Sony. I won't be buying Sony again."
4,"Couldn't put it down, but doesn't quite gel.","Excellent book, I really couldn't put it down. And it is an easy weekend read. What a unique blend of characters and storyline that includes AA and the holocaust!Kaylie Jones wrote this book blending present with flashbacks of background information. About halfway through the book, I got tired of that format, and was more interested in the chronology of events. So, I skipped through, reading the flashbacks, then returned to the middle and read the present.The ending seemed as if Jones was writing on deadline and was rushed. After such a rich, satisfying story, the quickly-put-together ending was a let-down.A very good read - I'm glad I found it."
3,Not a pleasant subject matter,"Speak now is about Clara, an alcoholic, who drinks to supress memories from her past and to cope with the depression that comes with her job. Growing up without a mother, Clara grew up with Anya and her father Vikktor recounting stories from prisoner camps. I didn't like the subject matter or the creepiness of Niko in this novel.The book deals with two drug addicts that fall in love and their back stories as to how they arrived up to present day. The book was really easy to read and a page turner, but, I always felt bad reading about their constant struggles in life. I didn't feel as though the book was a great read. I didn't identify or feel and sorrow for any of the characters. I am interested to read the rest of Kaylie Jones' work and see if I like the other novels better."
1,Unstable when lifted by the handle,I used it one time and want to sell it. With only one wheel on the far right side of the blade it tilts towards the blade when you lift the handle to go around a curve in my driveway. it then digs into the concrete or the lawn and tears it up. I purchased this thinking it would be as good as the Trim Rite trimmer I've owned for almost 20 years but it's not.
2,It's driving me nuts!,"While this keyboard and mouse mostly work well, I've had two problems:1. 30% of the time when I reboot the computer doesn't detect the keyboard, so I have to keep a normal keyboard plugged into my computer at all times.2. The mouse has been telling me for over THREE DAYS that the batteries are critical... but if they're critical, how am I still able to use the mouse?? Obviously it tells you far too early that your battery has run down, causing you to spend too much on replacement batteries."
1,A RIP OFF!,I purchased this book used from a seller LetiC2000 and it was missing 3 chapters! I had too make copies from a book from another classmate. That's the only review i have:(
2,"Biased, weak and with little use, but concise","I read this book here in Brazil.I'm an agronomist and I like to read books.This book has an obvious anti-catholic bias.About the popes who were murdered by their catholic faith, there's nothing.The enormous failures of famous protestants such as Luther (anti-semithism and racism), Henry VIII (madness, womanizer, etc.), etc. have no place on this book.Even about the founder of pentecostalism , the pastor Charles Fox Parham who was an eugenicist, pedophile, gay and racist, there's no place in this book.The anti-catholic bias is obvious.No defects are showed, among famous protestant founders.In fact, 100% of great protestants had enormous defects.The best chapter of this book is about Islam.Showing Islam as a result of a weak easter christianity,in a chapter.This book has some very little utility."
3,Fairly Good Product for the Price,"These clamps are slightly heavier than other 12"" clutch type clamps and seem to be adequate for light to medium duty use. The threads are slightly rough and make for less than smooth tightening. I've only used them on one project so far and they performed as expected. I would probably supplement their use with other clamps as well. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase."
2,Not what I expected....,"These sheets look very similar to ones I purchased several years ago through Linen N' Things. They felt great while in the package, but after washing, became very rough to sleep on. I have washed them several times since then, and they are not getting any softer. These sheets are also too lightweight. Honestly, I wish I never would have purchased them and went back to buy some other sheets made by a different manufacturer. I would not purchase these sheets if you want soft sheets to sleep on at night! I am going back to my old ones ASAP!"
3,A little out of date...,"This was no doubt an excellent introduction to both Portlets and WebSphere Portal several years ago, but it's showing its age. It describes JSR-168 as ""still a very young standard"" so it uses the WebSphere API throughout. The current version of WebSphere supports the JSR. If your application is going to stick with the IBM API then this is still a good tutorial, but if you want more JSR-168 training I'd recommend another introductory level book."
4,Truly remarkable story,"Alexandre Dumas is a real master teller. He is so knowledgeable of the history that you can never tell between that fact and the fiction. You almost feel like living in the 16th century. You can sense it.The abridged version is to the damage of the story. It has not been very carefully selected which parts to leave out or which parts to shorten. Sometimes it takes a while to realize that the story jumped forward in time and some parts are being given an unnecessary extend (the decription of Mary's will, for exemple). Also the part describing her execution is a bit too morbide.But in any case, this is a great piece of work. It has both its entertaining and historical value.The performance of the reader - Julie Christie - is excellent. She switches from English to Scottish to French accent to support the atmosphere and her voice is clear and easy to follow. I can highly recommend to buy it."
5,A lot of Information in One Little book.,I love this book. There is an education to be had in reading this book. Information only experienced experts in the textile industry can give you. This book is a desktop reference for anyone with interest in sewing or working with technical fabrics for extreme conditions and environments. This book is a must read if you want to work with technical fabrics for outdoor and extreme environments. Job very well done Ms Lindgren
2,Poor design with hard to fit lids,The lids don't fit without a lot of fiddling and the divider doesn't go to the top so food spills over into other compartment. Not what I was expecting for the price.
2,Divider is too short,"The divider doesn't go all the way to the lid. Not even close. I wanted something for the kids' lunchboxes. This didn't work out, so I returned it."
2,lid fit is questionable,"This container isn't bad but its not to good either,,,,,,sometimes its not a good seal shut"
3,Great Demonstration/Test Disc!,"I purchased this disc, along with a few others, hoping it would give me a good idea of the capabilities of my stereo setup after upgrading speaker cables and interconnects and adding a tube pre-amp and a Music Hall DAC (Digital-to-analog converter) to my setup.This 2-channel disc was a great choice to test the highs and lows of my system.Musically, it is a mixed bag of dialogue, music and poetry -- maybe not to everyone's taste - Check out the samples, though.Good disc to test my 2-channel stereo setup, and, after a few glasses of wine, an enjoyable audio presentation."
4,Solid melodic aor release......,"Harry Hess has a talent for writing good songs with hook laden choruses full of harmonies. He has a knack for writing radio worthy songs, without sticking to 3 chord arrangements....(sadly, you probably won't hear this cd on the radio waves). The standout tracks on this cd are:Wasted AwayJust Another DayWhy (this is one of the strongest songs on this cd, how this isn't a massive hit, I'll never know)Miles AwaySentimental BLVDThe other tracks are well done too, but don't shine as these ones do.Fans of Kip Winger would easily get into this cd, as well as Harem Scarem's ""Higher"" and ""Weight Of The World""."
1,This thing sucks.,"Yeah, this thing is a peice of junk. Its made out of extremely cheap card board. Ignore the lies in the product description that say it's sturdy, water resistant, and leather like. You also have to asemble it yourself and guess what? It doesn't fit togehter right because the dimesnions of the cheap card board don't line up to where its supposed to snap together.I'd rather suggest lighting a 10 dollar bill on fire. At least you will be more entertained by watching the bill burn then you will be by trying to put this thing together and then throwing it in the trash can afterwards.Hopefully, one day companies will give us decent DVD storage. However, don't give your money to this company trying to rape the consumer with their extremely over-priced junk."
3,I guess it could be worse,"It is not as if I expected a very sturdy box, but I expected it to be a little better constructed. Some snaps in some of the boxes were already loose when I receive them. The black paper lining of most is curling up at the edges because it was not stuck with enough adhesive. In other words, these look much cheaper than I expected or that described. I am disappointed because it is a good concept. All they needed was some basic good manufacturing practices to get them done consistently right. I don't think they are worth what I paid for them."
2,Damaged/broken when delivered,"One of the boxes was damaged prior to shipment. The shipping box was not damaged, therefore the product was damaged prior to packaging. Quality control needs to be better prior to shipments.I need to return the damaged product. Please advise how to do this without hassle or expense to me.Regards,Victor L. Weber"
2,Poor Quality,I've bought this brand in the past and was very pleased with it. This time seems like the quality of the product has gone down. The material thats glued over the cardboard on 5 out of the 6 has come unglued so there are ripples in the material. I don't think I would buy this product again.
4,Great Storage,"I had my dvd boxsets lying around in bags and decided to purchase this box to put all my collection in. This is a great product. The DVD cases fit perfectly inside with a little room on the top and bottom. I recently purchased another one of these. One thing that I would have like to have seen was a divider that came with the boxes. Either way, the box does it's job in storage and protection for your DVD."
3,Basically a shoebox,"It does as requested, but is basically a shoebox which you can get for cheaper in other places. Easy to put together."
2,Problem snapping one button,"It looks good and assembly is very easy. It snaps together with 8 silver buttons. But one of the buttons would not snap. The other 7 snapped together fine, but one of them (in the top front) did not snap.I assumed possibly if I just tried a little harder it would snap together. It still did not snap. Then I went for the vice grips with the hope that it would snap it together and I would never need to un-snap it in the future. Even the vice grips did not help it.If I had to do it over gain, I would have waited till I got to a Target or Walmart type store and purchased a clear box with a lid to hold dvds."
4,Does the Job,"Fast delivery and fast assembly. My dogs tend to chew on it since the material isn't strong, but it still does the job. Plus great price!"
4,Great for the Price,"I bought three of these for my CD collection. I like the look of the product. The snaps can come apart easily, but, for the most part, it's not an issue. Good purchase."
5,Must buy.,"For the amount of money I spent, I was expected something flimsy and pathetic. But it's great! It is really easy to put together, (I literally could put it together with my eyes shut). Also, it is rather decent to look at on a shelf.I was looking to replace a very ugly DVD stand off in the corner of my living room and these are so much nicer. Plus, it clears out a lot of room. Big bonus- I can alphabetize my DVD collection! How nice. :)"
4,"Perfect size, looks nice, better than expected","One of the reviewers expected something different than what they received. When I received these items they were better than I expected. For less than $6 you better believe my expectations are low. These exceeded my low expectations. Are they fine top grain leather, water tight to 600ft below the ocean's surface, anti-corrisive, and come with a hot date? Heck no! That's not what I expected either.One thing that isn't true in the advertisement about these boxes is the number of DVDs they hold. The ad says 26. It lies. It holds 28 very comfortably.If you plan to open and close these boxes all of the time and want them to last forever, you might want to consider something else. I think they will break down over time with heavy use."
2,Disappointing,"Expecting great insights from the associative title to Mars / Venus, the disappointment is natural. This book is quite poor in insight and quite rich in trash. A pity."
4,Relatively well know facts presented without the ennui of reading scientific material,"Quirk doesn't really present any mind blowing facts in this novel. In fact, if you've ever taken any sociology/anthropology/psych/biology classes then you're probably pretty familiar with most of the material presented in the book. What makes this book worth reading though is that the material is presented with humor, and not the usual dry, scientific bore-me-to-death prose of similar novels."
1,gibberish,It is just plain bad and self contradictory. The usual liberal goo repackaged as natural selection.
4,Garage Situationists still got it,"I've followed Lyxzen and company's career since first seeing Refused""s ""New Noise"" video and being blown away and his departure into TINC did not disappoint. I thought they were one of the coolest, most compelling and most original acts out there and I still do- notwithstanding the fact that I don't think Armed Love will be remembered as there monumental break-out album. But stacked up against everything else that's out there, it's catchy, it rocks and it takes a political stance that most bands are either too scared or not educated enough to go anywhere near. Lyxzen's vocals are great, they are amazing live. Can't wait to see what they do next! Bring back Sara!"
2,Rick Rubin should never produce again,"I'd call myself a fan of (t)inc, but this album is so bad I am going to limit the amount of time I spend reviewing it. Rick Rubin took a very good band with something to say and turned them in to a crappy knock-off of the Black Crowes. He should be banned from ever producing another record of an existing band. Gone are the hard-edged lyrics of revolution, replaced by such forgettable lines as ""baby wear something that turns me on"". If you have listened to and enjoyed any of their previous work, run away from this album as fast as you can."
2,Armed Love,"Armed Love~ The (International) Noise Conspiracy sounds like a bunch of teenage kids take on politics and to write Marxist lyrics is so passé. It is like INC have been asleep 20 years and not realized that no one believes in those ideas any more. The red cover is just a hoot and it so obvious that they are harkening for the good ""olde"" days when the soviet union existed and the book-let is such a joke. Another problem is that many of the songs a bit to much alike and the lyrics seem to have been pulled from an old leftist album from the 70's and is filled with trite leftist propaganda. Not recommended."
3,Does the job but not very durable.,"I have an aggressive dog who needs to wear a muzzle any time he leave the house and a dog who eats nonfood items that could be harmful to her. I needed a muzzle that would be comfortable, allow both of them to drink and pant but would also stand up to the wear and tear that an average dogs would inflict on it. I needed it to stand up to being bumped and pushed on when they rolled in the grass or when the tried to eat something off the ground, etc.... I bought 2 of these muzzles and used them for a number of months (not quite a year). Both muzzles started cracking and breaking 6 months or so after buying them. My dogs had not done anything unusual while wearing the muzzle. They did not abuse the muzzles or hit anything hard with their mouths or noses while wearing them. I had to buy new muzzles to replace these less than a year after purchasing them. I would not purchase these again for my dogs."
2,Intercooler = Xbox Death,"Nyko...OK, lets package the Intercooler of Death with some other items and maybe they won't notice. Stay away from the Intercooler it will kill your Xbox 360 and void your Xbox warranty. This is a fact, just look up the intercooler on this site and read for yourself or better yet call Xbox. They will tell you it is not authorized for use on the Xbox 360!PS The two stars are for the Charge Station and the Battery Packs."
4,Great product.,"Unfortunately, this product was used, which I expected, however, I wish I knew someones name had been written across all the bindings. It would have influenced my purchase."
4,office reference,"I have previously found this reference quite useful, but my office practice patterns no longer provide me opportunity to benefit from it. Nevertheless, it has served me well and satisfactorily when I needed it in the past."
3,Disappointed,"I have ordered English holiday tea blends in the past but this one was disappointing. It was spicey but left a bitter after taste. It came in nice little silk packets but I think I was expecting at least the faint taste of citrus. I would not order this again. After the holidays, I found it in the local Target store here."
3,Good tea.,"Nice tea and smells wonderful. For some reason though after we drink it, we all start coughing a bit. Like there is something sour in our throat."
5,Tasty,It is a nice holiday treat. Worth waiting for the season to enjoy it. A must try for any tea lover.
5,"Tea for two? Nope, just me, not you.","I also reviewed the same product, but in bag form instead of sachets. Very good for sun tea, and it is bolder in the sachets style. So I use 6 per gallon with these and 8 per gallon with the other. If you like cinnamon as I do, this will be a very welcome treat."
1,The Dvd Skips and Freezes...,I ordered A Kenny Rogers Christmas DVD I Got It .. Played It .. It Skips and Freezes up..I buy Alot From Amazon and That it Is Defective Suprises me.. Never Had A Problem Before..
3,Okay DVD,The DVD came on time and was in excellent condition wish they had more kenny rogers singing like the one he did for halmark.
4,Still good,"I saw this book some time back and it was a really good introductory book with a lot of simple and useful thoughts , plans, and purposes to really get me on track for a good growing operation to be more self sufficient"
5,A complex tapestry of intertwining stories,"The Lawyers: Class of '69 is an original and deftly written novel by John M. Poswall that blends reality and fiction into a seamlessly entertaining whole. In the mid-1960s, many Berkeley law school students were intent on changing the world; thirty years later, they meet at a class reunion and question themselves (and one another) as to whether they truly made a difference, and if so, was it for the better? A complex tapestry of intertwining stories, ranging from dashed hopes to life-changing close calls to public demonstrations and private White House meetings, The Lawyers: Class of '69 is a highly recommended and thoroughly engrossing read."
5,The Lawyers Class of 1969,"Could not put it down. Historically a great walk down memory lane, I had forgotten so much. When asked ""Did we make a difference""? You find yourself asking the same question, and you bet we did, all in our own way."
5,Great Album!,"I bought this album because it was on sale - WHAT. A. FIND. !!! Great singers, instrumentalists - on my all-time favorite list - and I have MANY Christmas albums!"
3,Not what I was expecting...,"When I ordered this, I was thinking hand slapping, foot stompin' bluegrass. It's really not. It's Ricky's family doing your typical Christmas songs; not a bad deal, but not the Bluegrass Skaggs I thought I was buying!"
3,Not the same socks as in description / photo,I tried to order some athletic socks for myself and to my surprise I was sent some socks for females with rainbow colors? If I had more time to send them back I would have. Instead I gave them to my girlfriend. I won't be ordering anything from these guys again. And no I didn't order the wrong ones.Gold Toe 6 pack Cushion Liner Socks
2,Falling Down,"Though the socks fit my foot, they tend to fall down inside half of the slip-on shoes I wear with them. I think if the socks had a stronger/tighter elastic band around the ankle, they might work better."
5,The best cracker on the planet,"I just had to get my 2-cent's worth in about these Bistro Crackers. They have two versions available, multigrain and cornbread. The cornbread ones are good (4 stars) but the multigrain crackers are simply incredible.These are better-tasting than regular Town House, Ritz, Triscuts, stone ground crackers, Cheese Nips, saltines..... ALL of them. They are delicious by themselves but I really enjoy them with just a little pimento cheese spread from a local mom-and-pop store (or home made).Put a few of these in a zip-lock sandwich bag for a pre-lunch snack at work. My wife and I normally have COMPLETELY different preferences when it comes to food but we both agree 100% on the flavor of these super crackers. This is the best cracker invention to come along in many years!"
3,A fun movie,"This movie is all right. The action and intrigue are entertaining. The character himself is not really that relatable, though."
3,Dead Batteries,"It was a Christmas gift and when they opened it up, it did not work, bc the batteries were dead."
5,A great buy,"This is a great phone for the price. I agree that caller ID should light up, but that's a small shortcoming. The quality is great, and it doesn't sound like a ""cheap"" phone. I also like the diminutive size. I stuck one on the bedroom windowsill, and installed one in the laundry room and one in the garage ... adding convenience without breaking the bank."
3,"Good phone at great price, but some drawbacks","I am quite pleased with this product. I found the price very affordable. The design is attractive, or so I think with my black model.The [ringer] volume settings are OFF - LO - HI. I find the LO too low and the HI too high, but maybe it's just my hearing.My biggest complaint is concerning the lack of lighting for the Caller ID screen -- quite a hassle when the phone rings at night and a night lamp is not near by.Regardless, I've kept the phone, and in the end, I think that is what counts."
3,"Battery hog, but good featureset","I'd be happier with this unit if it's unpowered little brain didn't require FOUR AA batteries! And if it didn't chew through them at a rate of one set per several months. That can be an expensive proposition to keep running. However, the Caller ID featureset is quite nice and quite reliable. The unit sometimes needs to be ""rebooted"" in conditions I can't reliably reproduce. You have to unplug the handset from the base, and then plug it back in and this ""reboots"" the little brain."
2,Caller ID Didn't Work,"I bought 2 of these phones at another store and the caller ID did not work, eventhough I already had a GE caller ID stand alone unit and caller ID on another phone--so it was definitely the phone with the problem. I never returned the phones because I didn't really need the caller ID."
4,"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, Vol. 2 - A review","I found the DVD to be very cute. While the show is for young children, children of all ages will enjoy it."
3,Surprised and delighted by revelations in book,"I purchased this book because of my fascination with the Black Hills and early explorations, and the impact of those on the development of the West. I had conducted earlier research about Custer's 1874 trip through the Black Hills, and found that the journals not only supported but added to that information.This was an easy read and certainly added to my Black Hills historical knowledge. ... I enjoyed it and it was surprisingly well written, with vivid descriptions of the areas they passed through and even feelings about others involved in the explorations. Used in conjunction with other books (Exploring with Custer, the 1874 Black Hills Expedition by Ernest Grafe and Paul Horsted), this journal not only illustrates the areas they traveled, but the life of soldiers and adventurers in the West and the richness of the Black Hills."
2,Not What I Expected,"I was looking for something to give me some ""real"" pointers I could use when talking to my special needs daughter about sex. Instead, it reals more like a text book. It was not what I was looking for and definately not what I expected."
1,"Should be in the ""Religion"" section","This book is strongly slanted to fundamentalist ""Christian"" dogma. The section regarding the possibility that your child might be gay is particularly disturbing. It basically recommends that you remain calm and be nice to them until you can have them counseled and hopefully changed into a heterosexual. This may be what that type of ""Christian"" believes, but it is totally contrary to healthy psychological development."
2,pendant review,"Delivered with good speed and packaging, but unsatisfactory product. It looks like it came out of a cereal box. Don't waste your money."
3,It's just ok,Nothing interesting about this movie but nothing bad about it either. I bought it because I like watching anything that includes Alexis Bledel. I enjoyed it but it is not for everyone.
2,Boring,"I couldn't even finish watching this movie. Jay Baruchel is a horrible actor and actually seems nervous and unsure onscreen. The whole plot was stale and tries to force viewers to care about mundane characters in a mundane scenario. Baruchel's character is torn between his fiancee and an ex. Been there, done that."
4,DVD: I am Reed Fish,"This is a good movie. It is a little awkward and slow but it is a really funny and sweet story about small town boy who suddenly decides that his perfect little ""make believe"" life is not what he wanted. Alexi Bledel is great in the movie as she is in everything....worth the price."
1,so bland youll wish you had never taken a bite,"long, boring, predictable...this high school cliche love story only changes as the convoluted ending shows up, not to save the rest of the film, but to change up the ""boy gets cold feet before wedding"" formula, but it fails to bring any sort of complex intrigue to the film.the soundtrack reminds of the socal bands whose lyrics please only the drunken 14 year old girls desperate for a boyfriend from a small that that has fallen into the gap.no offense to drunken 14 year old girls."
1,Lacking the best songs in the movie,"The highlight of the delightful film ""I'm Reed Fish"" is Schuyler Fisk's bar song ""From Where I'm Standing"" followed by her wedding song ""On Your Arm."" The movie revolves around her character as well as her lovely composition and performance; yet, inexplicably, neither song, nor any song by her is on this so-called soundtrack."
2,just weird.,the only reason i watched this movie was because alexis bledel was in it. and that is the only reason i would ever watch this movie again.the whole plot that he made a movie about his life is just weird. he in a way embaerassed his ex-fiance by showing he didn't choose her. i personally liked katie (bledel) better than jill in the first place.and to top it all off the main character (reed fish) was just plain unlikeable. though alexis did a great job playing the town sweetheart getting dumped... i would next time just skip this movie and watch her in something better. don't waste your time on it.
4,I'm Reed Fish,"I wasn't crazy about the story, but love anything that Shiri Appleby is in. I did enjoy it.Great service. The DVD arrived very quick."
2,PG doesn't mean it's okay,"This movie is well done for the most part, funny and engaging ... to a point. The main character, Reed Fish, wavers between two women throughout - and simply demonstrates that he loves himself more than either of them.We the viewers are supposed to believe that Reed is misunderstood and has, ""always tried to be what others expect,"" while at a more basic level he is simply an irresponsible and self-centered young man, desperate enough to sleep with the prospect he doesn't like so much just so he can keep her on a string (in case the other girl doesn't work out).Spoiler warning! Do not read ahead if you intend to watch the show ...The most irritating part is the way the female characters turn around and act as though Reed has done the right thing in the end. Ugh. NOT such a good object lesson, since everything works out for Reed."
2,Where do I get the song Schuyler fisk sings in the movie?,"Does anyone know where to get the song that Schuyler Fisk sings in the bar in th movie? It's not on the sound track, and I can't find it anywere."
3,A okay book,I can't say it was his best work because INTO THE LAND OF THE UNICORNS was his best work in my opinion. It was good as a MAGIC SHOP BOOK but nothing else. I would recommend it.
2,The mystical magical wonderful book.,"The book was about a girl named Jennifer and a toad that she bought from a magic shop for a school project about pets. The only thing she did not know about the toad was that the toad,bufo, could talk. I would recomend this book to people who like Fairy tales , or books with magic. The characters in this story are Jennifer ,Ellen, Mr Elives, Sharra, Skippy, Brandon,Mrs.Murdley, and Bufo the toad. My opinion of this story was that it was not so good but ok. I thought the book was boring."
4,Good Stuff!,"XYZ will always be lumped in with the ""hair band"" scene. This is a shame really. Great song writing with great hooks. If you liked ""XYZ"" and ""Hungry"" you should like this one as well. Terry's voice has held up well over the years. Same great guitar tone. ""Letter To God"" should give you a taste of that guitar tone we all love. ""Tango"" is another great track you should check out. ""Rainy Day"" takes a minute to really get rocking but once it does it is high octane Rock and Roll.""United"" may be the heaviest track on here and will surely get your head bobbing back and forth. Something here for everyone including a ballad or two. Pick it up!"
4,great cd,i was surpised by this cd it s hard rock but with a modern twiststill heavyit has that 80 s sound with a more mature soundi love terry s voicethe songs are far better then the hungry cdthe lyrics are heart feltit sounds sincere
4,great ride on!!,I USUALLY DONT WRITE REVIEWS BUT THIS TOY IS GREAT. HE LOVES TO SIT IN THIS WHILE WE GO FOR WALKS...HE LIKES THIS A LOT BETTER THAN HIS STROLLER. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS IT IS LITTLE LOUD BUT FOR A 15-20 MINUTE WALK HE LOVES IT. IT ALSO HAS A HANDLE FOR MOM AND DAD TO PUSH WHICH IS A GREAT FEATURE FOR THE YOUNGER KIDS.
3,Safety Hazard,"I bought this toy for my 15-month-old and he enjoys it. The problem is that he figured out how to take off the safety belt in two seconds. (It is made of velcro.) While I was taking him for a ride, he quickly ripped the belt off and stood up. He fell over onto the sidewalk. A belt with a clasp would be better. I know the car goes only 2 mph, but it is faster than you realize. Some improvements are needed."
5,The red rocket!,"I gave this car to my grandson for his 1st birthday and he loves it. He doesn't know how to steer it yet but when we take him out in it he does'nt want to get out of the car. He just wants to keep riding and riding. The only problem we had with it was putting the steering wheel on, it was really difficult.I even called the company to make sure we were doing it right and not going to break the car by forcing it on. Anyway my grandson love his red rocket and its a great buy."
4,Gotta be available for less!,"Wh en I was sixteen years old I was fortunate enough to have attended the Newport Pop Festival somewhere in the Los Angeles area. This was in, I think 1968,anyway, one of the featured bands was Cat Mother and the all night newsboys. I had never heard of them before this, so I did not really know what to expect. But upon hearing and seeing them live, I was completely taken by them. When their performance was over, they announced that they had just released an album and if we would please buy it. The very next day I went to a record store in Santa Monica and bought the album. I was so impressed with their performance that I just had to get it. And I never once regretted doing so. This album was one of my all time favorites for many ""vinyl years"". I have been keeping an eye out for it on CD, but this price is just a little too much for me. Hopefully the price will someday drop down to a little more reasonable level. If so I will be one of the first in line to purchase it."
3,missing tracks,"ive still got the original polydor vinyl. excellent condition. charlies waltz-written by charlie chin is not included on this cd. neither is ""probably wont"", ""bramble bush"", or ""track in a"". the waltz and probably wont are key omissions. Great album-produced by jimi hendrix. the lyrics to verse one of waltz are:she stood in the street holding her hat in her hands, i think i understand why shes smilin at me, the whole world can see from the sandals that she wears to the flower in her hair, how shes leading me on with a smile just like dawn, with an eye like a diamond, a walk like a whisper. shes gone.oh how i cried........."
1,INCOMPLETE!,"Although I have not actually heard this CD, I must comment on the fact that, based on the ""13-track"" listing appearing for this item, this is NOT the same thing as the original album. Those 13 tracks collapse into a much smaller number, since all of those old-time rockers listed (e.g., ""Chantilly Lace"") are only sub-sections of the song ""Good Time Rock 'n' Roll"". Several songs are missing, such as the 9-minute instrumental ""Track in 'A'"" and the song that previous reviewer Mountain Man is searching for, called ""Charlie's Waltz."" If you want to hear the full, 50-minute album as Cat Mother intended, I'm afraid you'll have to get hold of a very rare CD--not this import--for mucho dinero, or else obtain a 35-year-old scratchy piece of vinyl."
2,Snoring,"RT rated this story with 4 stars out of 4 1/2. I never trust the opinion of Romantic Times or well-known authors that put their spin on a book just for selling purposes. Riviting to the last page. Well, that's a matter of opinion. Chapter 1-4 lacks tension and adequate conflict. The heroine is wishy-washy and is willing to marry a man that simply wants to use her to take care of his kid. The opening hook was a snoozer, and I'm not willing to invest time in a dull story."
2,Poor offering,"Plumley started with a creative premise (make a blacksmith the hero), but she ruined the book with her heroine. None of Sarah's characteristics were consistent. She was at one point practical, almost masculine in her outlook on life and then would transform into a feminine, cutesy ball of fluff. Ugh. She was annoying in the extreme. I lost interest in her in no time at all. Skip this offering by Plumley."
2,this was a lot of nothing,"I thought this looked like a cute book, so I picked it up at my local used bookstore. I'm glad I bought it used because it wasn't worth a new price. Right off the bat, the author lost me. Her early descriptions of Daniel, the hero, made me cringe. He was a blacksmith and I got this mental picture of a big oaf. Her description just didn't make me think big guy with lots of muscles. I just thought, big clod. The heroine wasn't a whole lot better, but at least her description didn't make me roll my eyes.For a great description of a blacksmith, try K M Moning's description of Adam Black---a blacksmith to die for!!!!"
4,"Like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but better.","This was like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but better.Fantastical Adventure from start to finish.Sci-Fi cradled by humor."
1,I do not recomend this book!,"I highly advise ( If you do not want to be scared for life! ) to never read this book. Is is poorly writen, very inapropriate, and down right dumb. As I read this book I felt like I was losing IQ points!!! SAVE YOUR SELF-- NEVER, EVER READ THIS BOOK!!!!!ps. If I could have I would not even given this book one star!!!"
1,Tiresome,"In 2287 an alien disguised as a chicken (Ethel) comes to earth to help a teen-age boy, (Jay) fulfill his destiny and save the dwindling human population. Ethel's constant snarky criticisms of human beings as unintelligent and the human race as a distinctly sub par species quickly grow tiresome. In Ethel's defense, however, Jay really is as dumb as a post. Most of the suspense as the two quest across the quirky future landscape is obviated by the chapter one revelation that Ethel is capable of, say, shrinking Jay to the size of gnat and teleporting him halfway across the galaxy, but won't (unless Jay is in real danger) so as not to interfere with Jay's Grand Destiny to Save Humanity From Itself. If Jay is about to do anything to jeopardize the mission, the chicken quickly intervenes, but doesn't let Jay know. The author switches between the two viewpoints.Future Eden tries for an odd, wry, off-the-wall, Douglas Adams-style wit, but only manages odd. And boring. Not recommended."
2,Farmer vs. Collins,"This book, one of Collins's late sensation novels, is decidely less well constructed than ""The Woman in White"" or ""The Moonstone"": you are very often able to tell what will happen next and even how the whole thing is probably going to finish.The editor has done his best to increase the attractivity of the book by adding to it an exhaustive documentation. But what is really VERY annoying is that the editor, who according to his introduction pretends to give a philologically reliable text of the novel, obviously has dispensed himself of a serious proof-reading.A great number of misprints have not been corrected -- in some instances, the sense of the text has been almost perverted (e.g. because quotation marks are missing so that you don't know that it is a person of the novel and NOT the narrator who is talking).Things like these shouldn't occur in a text edited by a professor of philology."
5,Whirlwind Wedding,I loved both Whirlwind books and look forward to Whirlwind Groom that comes out in January 2005. I just finished Whirlwind Wedding and never came across a wedding in the book. Was I missing pages? Did anyone else notice this? Like I said I loved this book even though I never did come across a wedding.
2,"Well, it could be worse",The biggest problem I have with this paint is it's chalky look after it dries on canvas. It doesn't have the quality of acrylic. At least it's a good pink. Thought it would be a tad darker though:(
2,does not latch into the phone,"The phone-end connector does not latch into the phone and falls out. I compared the latches on this item to those on my original charger and it looks like the new ones are installed improperly and do not engage the phone receptacle.I also notice a difference between the new and original phone connector, in the # and locations of the pins. But I do believe the new one will charge the phone since the red LED turns on when the unit is connected to the phone (and when the unit is not plugged into the car outlet)."
5,Geordie the book,"A lovely story that is timeless really, my son remembered it from his childhood and was delighted to receive it again. Just as described and a joy to read."
2,Disappointed,I read this book many years ago and I thought it an excellent for young adults. However I was disappointed that the story had been changed to suit an audience in the USA.
1,Don't waste your money,"I should have taken the negative reviews seriously. This product is useless and dealing with dbroth, the seller is worse.I have allergy's to dust and this product picks up very very VERY little. It doesn't clean the air or anything it promises to do.I had the Ionic Breeze before this and it worked beautifully for 9 plus years.I'm sorry to sound negative or like some kind of hater. But, when I tried to return this because it didn't function as promised, the seller told me to contact to manufacture and never replied to any more e-mails.This is simply my experience as unpleasant as it was."
1,Didnt work,It didn't work out of the box. Too much hassle to send it back and hope for a new one. Very disappointed
2,"Works for smell, not smoke","I'm a smoker, so obviously my house smells like smoke, this thing defintiely ionized the air which neutralizes the smoke smell, although the collection plates aren't collecting dust or smoke (by coloring the collection blades) I've been looking for a good ionic pro for a while and sad to say this isn't it..."
1,Poorly Designed Product Very low Quality Bad System,"Hello,I made the mistake of buying one of these units, what a mistake! Very poorly designed, extremely noisy and inefficient. Due to the lack of quality design, you cannot clean the entire unit properly and must send it back for service every three months or so( at your cost both ways ). This is designed as a ""throw away"" unit and does not clean the air very well. You are much better off with Sharper Images version of this device, they are the original designers their products are more efficient ans simple to clean. As far as the joke trinket thing for your car, HAHA.Thanks and heed my warning."
2,Not impressed with Ionic technology,"I had the Ionic pro on all day for 4 days in a small bedroom. There was nothing on the blades, they were squeaky clean and the dust was still all over the room : ( I am however very impressed with Amazon's return service. I just printed out a "" No postage necessary"" page, cut it out and mailed it back at no cost for a return : )"
2,Welcome to the Ozone Zone,"Bought this unit to rid cat box odor. Plugged unit in and Wa La, cat odor gone. However, unit created a very noticeable Ozone odor/smell. Very very noticeable.Smelled like the subway station at Government Center. Could not accept this, unit returned.Purchased a Hoover Air Purifier, TiO2 Technology - WH10200 Pre-filter and ionization without a ozone odor after affect. Cat box odor gone also."
3,Still concerned about ozone,"This unit does admit some ozone,that seems to be still a controversial issue.The unit does clean the air and removes smells associated with animals etc.I cannot endorse it because it is possibly detrimental to those with lung conditions .I am a bronchial asthma person,and any complications scare me.The unit has a nice design,and the blades you clean are an alternative to buying hepafilters.It includes a car filter which may appeal to a buyer. .I have a family member who swears by his,but my health caution will not let me run it.This unit will not remove animal hair,but is good with dander etc.My honeywell unit does it all and is a different technology."
5,so far so good,"I have had this for a couple of weeks now, was a little unsure due to very good price and also that the last time i used one of these things was a ionic breeze that cost me nearly ~400-500.... good product works as advertised."
2,IONIC PRO COMPACT AIR PURIFIER,"After reading all the reviews I was a little skeptical about purchasing one of these but I really wanted to try this technology after no success with Honeywell products. (The fans continually fail within a few months of purchase.) The information that comes with it is very good but the product continually cycles on and off no matter what setting you have it on or what you try to do to help it. According to the booklet that comes with it, it is supposed to stay on continullay on the high setting. An air purifier is useless unless it is on so this works only half the time that you intend to use it. Would guess you have to buy the double pack version to have one of them going all the time. Really disappointed about this as you shouldn't have to have two running to take care of a small room.Ionic Pro 90IP1RCMB1 Compact Air Purifier with Bonus Car Ionizer"
2,Stinks really bad even after 5 days,"I don't know if I had a bad unit or if Ionic products are supposed to smell that bad but I couldn't take it anymore so I return it. I prefer the dust 1,000x better than the horrible smell that thing was giving out. This is my first Ionic product. Can someone with more Ionic products tell me if that is the way it supposed to to smell??? i doubt it because it's hard to take. Did I get a unit with issues?"
2,Fails to do as promised,"1. Good history of cremation, appears to be well researched.2. The balance of the book is a rehash of problems funeral homes and cemeteries have had over the last 25 years, and the philosophies of anti-funeral personalities. (Jessica Mitford fans will applaud wildly). Some errors of fact appear to indicate a lack of depth in understanding and background.3. Tending to our dead in the 21st century is summed up in the final two pages as "" What your have been seeing is what you will see in the future.""Not the best use of reading time"
1,Use the $20 towards a sturdier stroller,"The price and weight are the only positive things I have to say about this stroller. We've had it for about 3 months and I've had to replace it. (Chicco Capri-love it and nearly as light!) The wheels have gotten warped and hard to control and you will notice there is no substantial back support for the little one. Can you imagine riding around with your spine humped over? Also, there is a large gap between the fabric seat and the metal frame. My little girl sticks her hand in there and gets it stuck. The canopy does provide some coverage, which is good.If you value durability or expect to use your items for more than one child, this isn't the stroller for you."
3,It was average,"This was an OK PPV...Jericho/Malenko , Juvi/K-Dogg were great , but the treat was Benoit vs. Raven vs. DDP ..thats worth half the price ,but there rest was average or medicore"
4,awsome!!!,this is one of the best wcw events ever. the entire card was pretty good but the hogan vs. savage catch match was great. get this video!
1,Dont buy it,After about 6 years the original latch gave up and we purchased this replacement.Two weeks later it tore apart (how many times can you use it in 2 weeks?). Now we have no latch and not sure how to find a better one. Guess we'll have to use a brick!:)
2,Not very sturdy,"I have purchased two of these so far, they break really easy if you do not close the lid just right. The igloo cooler is top notch but the latch, they need to go back to the drawing board"
5,a perfect fit replacement for my cooler,"When the latch on my cooler broke I was a bit upset because the cooler cost $40 and was now rendered less useful by the failure of a 2 cent piece of plastic. Although the replacement part is overpriced, it did work as a perfect replacement and save me the cost of a new cooler!"
5,Great item.,"Great item. Latch can break, so treat it gently!Does the job well.Nice transaction and great seller.I would recommend this item to anyone who needs one of these."
1,Latches are junk plastic,"I am not hard on my things, but the latches on the original cooler and the replacement latches both lasted only about a month of full time use. Maybe because of the desert heat? Whatever, I think that the life span should be measured in years, not in months or even weeks. My previous cooler was still working fine after many years when I got a bigger one. I think they switched to cheaper parts.If you are looking at latches, then you are having the same problems I am. I know Igloo sells metal latches, though you may need to go to the Igloo site to find them. That's going to be my next attempt. I've got about as much invested now in latches as I did in the original cooler."
1,junk,"The latch that originally came on my cooler lasted 7+ years and dozens of outings. The new one broke on the 4th trip I made this year. This means after only 12 days of use the cheap plastic top latch simply broke off. Now I need a new latch again, will have to try the one with the metal latch hundge next time."
2,Broke within a week!,"Hi,I use this cooler every day. It's opened 30 times, or so, a day. I bought a replacement latch and it lasted 3 weeks before it broke. Most people use there coolers a few times a year. I would think it would last a few years if it wasn't used every day. But, in my opinion, it's a cheap piece of plastic made to be replaced every so often. It's called a revenue stream. I'm not going to replace it again. I duct taped it on and use it as a lid handle for opening the cooler."
5,my dream case,"this is my dream case, exactly what i was searching for - screen cover, interchangeable belt clip, easily use the click wheel, and easy access to the headphone jack as well as the hold button - i would recommend this case to anyone buying an ipod nano"
3,Get the basics on public lands,"National Parks, State Parks, STate forests, National Forests, Wilderness areas . . .The public lands of Michigan encompass over one million acres. IN these jewels are thousands of campsites, rivers, forests. This book gives you a thumbnail of each. A good start to planning a trip. Some information out of date."
2,"old kit, limited by its age","The old tallgeese kit is showing its age. The newer HG kits are vastly superior and master grade blows the 1/100 scale away. We need to demand a mastergrade tallgeese from bandai.Good features:Its every tallgeese from the show and movie. tallgeese 1, 2 and 3. Comes with the parts to build any of them.The engine gimmick is nice.Bad:Poor joints. All weapons have weight issues. Two polycap joints are easy to pull out. Not even a flight stand holds this badboy together without paint to tighten the joints."
1,Read this book if you wanna hate accounting,"This was the first book I've studied in my life for accounting. Now I am very disappointed at the professor who chose this book as a text. If you want to hate accounting, buy this book. This book will make that dream come true."
1,This book will make you hate accounting,"It was a text book for my accounting class. Actually, it was my first meeting with accounting. The whole semester was a nightmare. The large of the nightmare could be attributed to this boring textbook."
5,Just what I was looking for,"I was looking for a kid's bathtub mirror so the kids could view their soapy mohawks and silly grins in the tub. All the mirrors I saw geared toward kids were too small or had characters on it that took up most of the space and the mirror part would let you look at your eye and cheek at best. Initially I worried that this TV mirror would be too small but when it arrived I was pleased to see the mirror portion was bigger than I thought. It has no suction cups on the back; it sticks to wet surfaces and will eventually slide off if either too wet or totally dry. It sticks on our tile walls. I'm very happy with this product, especially the size of the mirror. I'd recommend it!"
1,Disappointing,"This mirror has a ridiculous amount of distortion-- it's like fun house mirror. I hardly expect it to be like a glass mirror, but this is really low-quality. And it came scratched and clouded in the middle. I've been underwhelmed by Alex products in the past, and won't be buying any more of them."
1,Doesn't stick!,"We needed more bath toys for my son, and requested this for his birthday. He loved it...until we tried to stick it to the tub. It simply doesn't stick! Our tub walls are completely smooth...no tiles or grout. Everything sticks to them nicely - except this product. Also, it's quite small. Makes a decent mirror for an infant to play with on the floor, but not for the task it's designed to do."
2,Doesn't stick & rather small,"Doesn't stick to our tiles walls, even when wet. Got it so my 7 year old can see herself with funny hair when she gets shampooed, but it's too small to see much. I do like that it's cute and safe."
3,Not so bad,"Didn't last very long, the mirror got a little cloudy after a while. My son did enjoy it while it was good"
2,Mirror For The Tub,"It was very hard to get it to stick in the tub. Even I got it stick, it will non stop coming out."
4,Just what I was looking for!,"I bought this mirror for my three year old, because she was always asking to look in my handheld mirror while I washed her hair in the tub.The mirror sticks to our shower wall with no problems when wet. It will fall off when it dries out, as designed.This mirror is just as I expected it to be, and it works fine for us!"
4,Well Told,"Cheyenne AutumnI was pleasantly suprised by the image quality of this DVD. A title that is impossible to obtain in Australia other than through Amazon.The direction is typical of John Ford as is his choice of location shots. One can find the same location in many of his films, notably ""The Searchers"" My only regret is that the story is incomplete, by that I refer to the ending and one has had to have read Marie Sandoz book to understand that comment.The inclusion of Carol Baker as the Quaker missionary is odd. To my memory no such character appears in the book.The tragedy of the native people of the Americas is one of a clash of cultures that echoes across the globe. Progress can not be halted, the stone age must give way.If you are interested in a well directed and acted film depicting the conflictof cultures then this DVD is for you"
3,Could've been great!,"Cheyenne Autumn is the tale of a group of Cheyenne, who are so badly treated on the rez they decide to escape and return to their tribal lands. On their journey, they must brave the elements, the army, and the depredations of evil Anglo cowboy scalp hunters.The director attempts to draw parallels between the young and impulsive Cheyenne warrior and the equally young, and impulsive Cavalry officer (Smith)? But this sublot falls flat, after being prolonged for over two hoursSeveral meaningless subplots occasionally intrude... One. Involving the romance between a Quaker school marm and an Anglo cavalry officer. And Two... A minor plot involving Wyatt Earp.While this movie lacks a certain depth, and characterization, there are a few good points. Mainly the interaction between the tribal elders, and the beautiful cinematography.Overall, this movie was worth watching once, but would've been much better if it focused more on character development."
3,Very Uneven Western,"I was ultimately disappointed by this tale of the American mistreatment of the Cheyenne Indians in the years following the Civil War. Despite an incredible all star cast, beautiful photography, and a great score, this film failed to involve me as I watched it. I think the problem lies with the script. Very few characters are fleshed out, there are too many to concentrate on, and the story jumps around. The Jimmy Stewart / Arthur Kennedy sequence as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday is a lot of fun, but very unnecesarry to the film. Perhaps a more streamlined approach would have helped to focus the story more. In any event, the film has some beautiful moments and fans of Westerns or John Ford will probably want to see this one, but I suspect many people will be left unsatisfied by the end."
3,Western,I really like this older western! It tells a story of the Cheyenne indians and how they were treated by the soldiers and the white people. Richard Widmark played a great part in this movie along with other cast like Caroll Baker. This is a worthwild movie to add to a collection. James Steward had a short bit part in this.
3,read the book,"This movie is (loosely) based on the non-fiction book of the same name. Someone unfortunately chose to add in characters who were not involved in the real story, from Wyatt Earp to the Quaker school marm, since there were otherwise too few white people that the audience could sympathize with.It is unfortunate, because this could otherwise have been a much more powerful movie. As is, the story is flawed by Ford's adherence to Western movie formula.Not bad, but it could have been so much better. Someone please do a remake."
1,uggg! terrible movie!,"historically inacurate. about only thing correct are the names of the 2 chiefs and also they had horses. not much else is correct. they bolted from the reservation area in Oklahoma, near fort reno, not the desert sw?? also contained unneeded silliness with James Stewart's segment as the marshall of dodge city ks."
1,Cheeze and crackers,"Well, there's good cheese and there's bad cheese--this was Cheeze Whiz. Sitting through it was an ordeal. The intent may have been good--i.e., John Ford's ""apology"" to the Indians--but other than that it was one bad Hollywood cliche after another. Richard Widmark, who can't act to save his life, plays a sort of prototype Oskar Schindler who risks his army career to go to bat for the Indians. Karl Malden plays a Prussian authoritarian sociopath, an easy villain. The Cheyenne themselves might have been humanized here if their leaders hadn't been played by stodgy, middle-aged white men with pointy noses and mall bangs. Ricardo Montalban is in mediocre form as usual, and Sal Mineo is, also as usual, an Italian-American version of Elvis. The only Indians with any dignity are the extras, who appear to be real Indians but probably not Cheyenne. And on top of everything else, this had to end as a love story. Pass the barf bag, please."
1,Do NOT Waste Your Money On This Dog,Absolutely the most STUPID movie ever made. No historical accuracy whatsoever. Not a shred of believablity in the characters. The worst acting ever. Jeez. I can't believe I spent three bucks to suffer through this.
1,Interminable!,"I couldn't help but wonder if the story would ever go anywhere. And would these actors ever do anything they don't always do in every movie they make? Predictable, uninteresting, unexciting--spend your time on anything else, and your money too!"
1,Ford Trying to Milk a Dead Cow,"Ford goes to the well with all his familiar tools (Monument Valley, U.S. Calvary, Indian Wars, etc.) and comes back dry, to put it nicely.Great cast- Widmark, Mauldin, Stewart, Robinson, etc labor through an abominable script with the intellectual depth of a deodorant commercial.At its best, it is flat, contrived and silly and at it worst it is unnecessarily stupid- Latinos and Italians with five o'clock shadow playing Native Americans. Give me a break."
2,Whaaaat??,"This was I guess supposed to be a serious story of the awful treatment of the American Indians- and the first and last thirds of the movie do that quite well. HOWEVER, right in the middle of the story-the middle third- is a total comic western. It has only the slightest connection to the rest of the story and totally destroys the mood and feeling of the main story. It's almost like they had this unfinshed comedy western footage with expensive actors that they had to use up so they just spliced it in! Sorry, no thumbs up! Two stars only for the main story OR for the comedy, not the whole movie."
3,Did you know...?,"That this film was shot on the Navajo reservation and the Indians in the film were Navajos? That the dialogue that was supposedly in Cheyenne was actually in Navajo and had little to do with what was supposedly being said?All in all, it was a good attempt for its time, and a story that needed to be told. Perhaps someday an Indian director will remake it with Indian actors. As effective as it is, it could be so much more so."
5,LAST WESTERN PORTRAIT FROM A MASTER,"This was the last Western film done by John Ford, who was considered by many to be the genre's greatest director. Gems like ""The Iron Horse"", ""Stagecoach"", ""My Darling Clementine"", ""The Searchers"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" would certainly validate that consensus. Perhaps it wasn't the West of Frederick Remington or Charles Russell, but Mr. Ford's results are just as vivid. As is his custom, Mr. Ford rewards with viewer with beautiful visuals and stalwart performances from a star-studded cast. A fine tribute to the West of America ... and of John Ford. Let this one find a place in your DVD collection."
1,Not what I ordered!,"The one star is for the seller not the product. I've been using Shalimar products for years and love them all! The picture and description says body veil which is a cream. What I received was a tall dark blue bottle of the lotion. Again, a fine product but not what I ordered. As it was a Christmas gift and of comparable value I kept it but will not be ordering from them again."
1,No evidence for stimulation of DNA repair,"""Encourages the skin's DNA repair mechanism to self-correct"" - I have seen no evidence to prove this. The producers should have to undertake rigorous peer reviewed and properly controlled clinical trials before they can make such claims. Just use SPF 30 - it will protect you 100 times better than they claim their product does. Check their website, their is only highly objective conclusions drawn from their supposedly scientific data, which still have very small differences from pre-treatment (eg number of fine lines/mm reduce from 0.52 to 0.47 over 4 weeks - barely any difference and you could get the same thing from just using a moisturiser). Don't waste your money on unproven scientific gobble-de-gook!"
1,TOTAL GARBAGE,"This so-called movie is total bottom-of-the-barrel garbage. Total crap in everyway--script, acting, direction, production values. Looks like it was made by retards, and I don't mean the kind with downs syndrome. People with downs syndrome would have made a far better movie than this POS. The dum-dums who made this should buy up every copy and burn them all. God was this thing horrible. To see an actually awesome shoe-string-budget movie, check out ""There's Nothing Out There."" Now that's awesome low-budge movie-making. STAY AWAY FROM ""Lethal Crap."""
3,Its not that great,"Being someone who has read all of these books and goes out to read/buy them the first day they come out, I was really dissapoiinted. Its all about one mental struggle which is really booring. I read these books to promarily learn about treating horses there is nothing in them about that anymore! Personally I think these books are going WAY downhill"
3,boring,"From what ive heard about this book it sounds pretty boring. i dont no if i wanna even read #20 because i just found out she gos to collage, but i do no from the past books these r boring! they need more action and adventure, for example, the avalon series is really adventures, it has people going into other worlds by magic! now thats atventures!THESE BOOKS R PLAIN OLD BORING!!!!"
5,Really good.,"This book was about Amy struggling to go to collage while Lou is planning her wedding. People seem disapionted that Amy is considering going to collage. But whats wrong with collage? She still might be able to work part time at heartland.Also, in the review for heartland#18, we asked the book to be more exciting. Lauren Brooke listenned. Amy and Matt preformed an exciting act of rescue. I thought this book was really good!"
3,Please don't stop,I have not seen this book yet. But I will. I started reading heartland books by my mom renting #6 from my school library. And I was just hooked. I even got 3 buddys to start reading them. then one of my friends said that they would stop at # 20. I don't Know what I would do if they stoped. Pppllleeeaaassseee do not stop writeing them laurn Brook. Please ppplllllleeeaaasss.
5,This Book Is Awesome!!,"This is the best series of books ever! I have all the books (1-19 and 'A Holiday Memory', and getting #20 as soon as it comes out!). I love how its so emotional! I think it should be for girls up to like 15 no 12. I'm 13 and will read it for years on. I really wish that Lauren Brooke would write more than 20 books, but that's still a lot and I'm glad it went that high. I just hope that #20 has a good ending (hehe).P.S. I got all the books from amazon.com...and they got here extremely fast thx!!"
5,OMG! This better not be the end!!!,"I can't wait till this comes out! I was so used to getting the books back to back (because I had the first one and didn't keep up with it till last year) now I'm going crazy! These books are so good. I really hope this isn't the end of the series, if it is it's so short, only 20 books (including the Special Edition). But knowing the way the books are written Amy won't go to college and the series will go on (hopefully!)P.S. I'm rating the series not the book because it hasn't come out yet."
5,A Great First Novel!,"My kids have enjoyed Robert Elmer's children's fiction for years, so I was delighted to hear about The Duet! It is a heart warming story, set in a quirky Dutch farm town in Washington state, with characters that are easy to relate with and love, and has an unforgetable ending. I could barely put it down once I started it - I stayed up way too late last night and couldn't finish it so I made my husband drive the kids to school this morning so I could finish the last chapter! I look forward to more books from Mr. Elmer in the future and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Mitford series, Angela Hunt, Francine Rivers, or just a good old fashioned story! Wonderful!"
3,"Acceptable, but disappointing","I have been learning how to belly dance for the past several months, and I thought this series would build upon the classes and workshops I had already taken. I was disappointed. The moves she teaches are not traditional, and she goes beyond my comfort zone with her new-agey lectures as she dances. Shimmies can cause earthquakes? Please. There are also many times when you can't see what she's doing because the camera focuses on her face too much. I greatly prefer the Neena and Veena tapes that I own. I think I'll sell these and get Delilah's videos instead."
5,this set is great! don't let the previous review fool you,"i really like the goddess workout set. dolphina clearly shows how to do the movements, the production value is good, nice sets, camera angles that show you exactly how to move your hips, hands, feet, etc. the music is great and if you dont ""get"" something right away, you can always rewind and practice it until you do. i like the moves that i learned from these dvds and whether someone else thinks they are traditional does not matter at all to me. bellydance, like yoga, can be many things to many people. as far as workout goes, i get a great ab workout from doing this bellydance routine and feel great afterward.no one tape/dvd is going to be everything to every one. i like having a variety of workouts to choose from, it keeps me exercising every single day and that is what really matters."
1,SHE CAN'T TEACH!!!,"I am a bellydance student and maybe that is why I hate these videos. I thought I'd just pick them up to use at home to expand my dancing, but the way she ""teaches"" stinks! She barely explains anything new before you move right into a choreographed dance lesson. Especially the Zills choreography. Ugh, I can't even imagine I'll use them again. Hope someone enjoyed them."
3,Hard to follow,"I found the intro video incredibly hard to follow in places - because most of the time the cameras would focus on her face or another small part of her body. As someone who has never tried this before, I really felt I needed to see what the part of her body she was talking about was doing, at least, if not her whole body, in order to mimic it. I have 11 years of ballet and gymnastics behind me, so it isn't a dance impedement, it would just be really nice to get the whole picture."
1,The Belly Dancer Stereotype,"Dolphina is stereotype that every belly dancer fights against. There are so many better dvds out there that break down instruction showing the body part being used. A qualified teacher would use correct terminology and not degrade the dance by focusing on t&a. The dance is about sensuality, not sex. If you want a plus, the music on her beginning dvd is good and as said, the sets are beautiful."
3,laughing is good exercise....,"This video is okay, but I spend more time giggling then actually doing the steps.She is very spiritual and random. Like when she says ""plant your feet into the earth""....you mean the carpeting?? hahaI do think its a nice video, makes you feel sexy if you don't do it in front of a mirror...."
3,I had high hopes...,"I did some bellydancing several years ago and decided to getback into it as I enjoyed it and thought it would be afun way to work out.Delphina's sets are beautiful; they are very peaceful. Her costumes are lovely and for the most part, the skirts don't interfere with the view of what she's showing you. However,the camera work and/or editing left a lot to be desired.I needed to see what she was doing with her feet and arms, not the close-ups of her head and shoulders. There were times that I just had to stop until the camera pulled back to a full view.If I hadn't already had some instruction, I would have been so lost that I probably given up completely.Delphina seems to love what she is doing and it makes the video more enjoyable. I think that after getting some basic instruction and practice I will enjoy her presentation more."
3,"""Shoyle boyle"" is Turkish for ""Not So Great""","Really this DVD set is mediocre at best- particularly the beginners video. The biggest gripe I have is the Camera work. An exercise video should concentrate on the exercises being shown but half the time the camera is only looking at her face. They did a wonderful job as far as scenery and costumes, but its all worthless if you can't see what or how you are suppose to be doing the moves. Also, its more of an annoyance than anything, but she's really into the whole Chakra thing, I'm sure many people like to hear this stuff but personally I find it pretty Hippie Dippy, but what did I expect from someone named ""Dolphina"". Aside from her granola personality, she seems to be a good instructor, if only she could adjust the camera person/director's chakras into making a practical bellydance video."
4,Uplifting Workouts!,"I love to do the workouts on these DVDs--Dolphina is wonderfully positive and full of girl power! Evertime I do one of the workouts, I finish feeling happy, beautiful, sexy, and powerful. I would have given this DVD set 5 stars if the location and costume changes on the last three DVDs were as interesting as the first DVD, if and cool down sections on the DVDs were more thorough, and if the first DVD showed Dolphina's whole body when she was instructing you on difficult moves to make. Otherwise, the DVD set is a perfect pleasure!"
2,What is she doing?,"I agreed with some of the previous reviewers. This workout had potential, but since I cannot she what her body is doing, I have no clue how to follow. Majority of the time I am seeing Dolphina's face and upper body, but I have no idea what her hips and legs are doing. How am I suppose to follow her moves when all I see is her face."
3,"Great style, unhelpful camera work","My daughter and I really enjoy Dolphina's style, enthusiasm, spirituality, encouragement and humor. However, the camera work is not good much of the time. As others have said, while she's demonstrating complex lower body moves, the camera is on her upper body and you have absolutely no idea what she's doing down below. She's wonderful, but she needs to find a new cameraperson."
3,Okay for some ideas and a review,"I initally bought the DVD set because I wanted to learn more about veil and finger cymbal work and do not have access to classes, and getting the 4 pack was cheaper than buying individual DVDs. The production quality of the dvd was better than other bellydance instructional videos I own but I was not that impressed with Dolphina herself. I have been dancing for 5 years and may be biased, but I found her movements to be stiff, jerky, with little isolation between her lower and upper body (during the hips segment her head bounces has her hips move). While the choreographies at the end of the videos in theory have some decent combinations, Dolphina executes them poorly.Overall there are some good ideas of moves from the videos, and I will mopst likely continue to use them to help me guide my own practices, but I do not recommend the Goddessworkout tapes. Instead I would recommend the DVDs from Jilliana or tapes from Suhalia."
3,"Not a terrible book, but we have read better","""My Little Golden Book About God"" was a little above my preschooler's head. Many pages were written in words my child could understand (i.e ""God Is Great"" and ""God gives us everything we need""). The vast majority of the book, though, is written in such a way that I had a difficult time reading it to my daughter in a way she could comprehend. Long (almost run-on) sentences frequented the writing style of the author. I, as an adult, enjoyed this book, but would not recommend it for a child younger than about 8. Search a little more. There are some wonderful ""Books about God"" out there for young children."
5,god-loving children ... or cuddly menace?,this book has recently been discovered to be a primer for the parasitic offspring of an invisible alien invasion. read with caution!
1,My little Golden book about taking credit for stuff,"Vague genuflections to things in nature like inertia, plate tectonics, species diversity, internal morality and crediting these to God does not make a book about God anymore than saying these are caused by fairies would make a book about fairies.At times they seem to try to be too scientific when the purpose of the book is to indoctrinate kids into this myth. They need to keep it simpler.Some of the pictures are downright creepy. The little girl being given tea looks like a zombie, and the lack of pupils in some pictures are offputting. Some of the messages are a little odd like those stars are millions of miles away when the closest of them is, I suppose, 25,000 million miles away, and the suggestion of mountains decaying strongly suggests that all mountains just decay and glosses over most plate tectonics when it shouldn't even bring it up."
2,more bible than buddha,"Despite having the popular Zen phrase about ""killing the buddha"" in its title, this book has very little to do with zen, buddhism or any other non-christian spiritual tradition. The authors' focus is primarily on fundamentalist christian culture and a retelling of the books of the old testament from a contemporary sometimes controversial viewpoint. I think readers looking for insight into vanguard spirituality in America will be disappointed. The writing is very good, often funny, but more clever than authentic. One or two stories of unusual holy rollers would have been interesting, but there are far too many here. The authors in general come across as creative detached observors of quirky christians, rather than genuine seekers."
4,In celebration of heretics,"This often times hilarious but always serious journal of a spiritual journey across America in search of Buddha is worth reading. The book is a collection of experiences, impressions, and encounters with reality as the authors travel across the American continent looking for the various incarnations of Buddha along the way.The religious community has nothing to fear from the work of Manseau and Sharlet. They do not attack any religion, but rather they celebrate the spiritual venture many of us seem to be working toward. At the same time, they have an incredible collection of stories to keep us open minded about where we might encounter our own Buddha. If you don't have time to travel America, grab this book, sit back, and kill the Buddha vicariously."
5,A bible for believers,"Finally, a book that gives believers something to think about and lets them think about it themselves. Sharlet and Manseau combine their vivid stories of believers with dynamic versions of scripture, and the result is a journey that enables readers to think about what it means to believe here and now."
5,Including some never-before-published pictures,"Collaboratively researched and written by military historian Christopher Staerck and military aviation expert Paul Sinnott, Luftwaffe: The Allied Intelligence Files provides the reader with an amazing behind-the-scenes tour of the Allied intelligence service's struggle against the German air force in World War II. Drawing upon once-secret dossiers used to gauge enemy aircraft, and incorporating what is today known of the Luftwaffe, while utilizing black-and-white photographs of captured and deserted aircraft (including some never-before-published pictures), Luftwaffe additionally benefits from a straightforward and detailed narration. Presenting as it does the underside of one, critical piece of that global struggle, Luftwaffe is a very strongly recommended addition to World War II history and military aviation collections."
1,Don't waste your money.,Absolutely not what expecting. It was a comic strip and pretty much impossible to learn from.
3,"A good, solid chair, but not for everyone...","Save your money, just buy an exercise ball and sit on that while you work: it's more fun, better for you and your wallet."
1,PUMP BROKEN AFTER TWO USES.,i got this chair end of march. it is not good as other reviewed.today i tried to pump the ball. it didn't work. cheap stuff. don't waste your money.
2,Didn't work for me,It was too hard to sit on. I eventually got rid of it. It wasn't tall enough for me to sit on at my desk as I had hoped.
2,Too Low!,"I didn't realize there would be a 52 cm ball with this. As I am 5'3"", it puts me too low to the ground next to standard desk. I got a bigger ball, 72 cm, but now the back part of the chair is unreachable, and therefore unusable. I love sitting on a secured yoga ball, but I can put the bigger ball in a laundry basket for the same effect and that costs a lot less."
1,Pump is worthless,"I can't get the pump that comes with the ball to put enough pressure to actually blow up the ball to full size. Since the opening is so large, it's impossible to use a tire pump to take the place of the hand pump. Maybe I'd like the product if I could get it to the point that I can test it out."
4,Always on the Ball!,"We love our Gaiam Ball Chairs. There are two of us in the school office and we have been searching for a comfortable work chair for years. These are GREAT!! You truly feel your muscles working. They glide easily on carpet and great on linoleum. After spending a few days checking in supplies gliding back and forth between boxes, I could feel the results. One suggestion we have is to put the locking wheels in the rear so you don't accidentally step on the lock while seated in the chair."
4,Helping with back and sciatica pain,"I purchased this chair and received it two days ago. As other reviewers suggested, I inflated the ball and added more air each day. Today I was able to inflate it to it's full size. I'm hoping it will help with back problems that are acting up.So far, so good. I've had bad sciatica this week and have been able to sit on the balance ball chair with no pain. I'll see how it goes over time.To the person having problem putting the hex nuts on: my chair went together easily and the nuts for the bar went on with no problem. They do have to go on in a specific direction - I think it is with the wide flat side facing down. - maybe check to be sure they are going on in the right direction. It may only work one way."
3,Sore booty,"Overall I would say I am pleased that I purchased this chair. I can tell that I am actively engaging my core a lot more during the day, and when I think about it, my posture is better too. (Don't be fooled, you can slouch in this chair too.) What has shocked me the most is how much my bum hurts sitting on the ball. I guess since they encourage you to get up and stretch or walk around every 60 - 90 minutes it's a good reminder to do so, but wholly crap, this is a bit much! My bottom was really, really hurting after the first day I used the chair, and I was really glad I was only in the office a half day! Be warned, if you are not used to sitting on a ball all day, you will feel it...and not just in your abs like you think!"
1,This is not a desk chair,"I wanted to return this item but missed the window to do so. We put the chair together and realized that this chair was much top short to be used at a typical desk. I immediately put it at my desk and knew that this chair would not work. I have a standard desk so it is not the issue of the desk being taller than normal. Measure your desk before ordering. Also, the nuts that hold the ball rest onto the chair were the wrong size."
2,poor quality,"To be honest, the ball chair quality is ok. But the hand pump is of terrible quality. It was broken (air leakage) in the original package. I borrowed my friend's pump (same product but he's luckier to have a good pump) and spent quite some time to inflate the ball. Not easy job.When I issued a return request on Amazon, I was asked to return the whole product... which means I have to deflate the ball and disassemble the chair! I gave up. the seller should expect this kind of situation and give a ""pump return option""What if I got a broken screw. Do I have to return the whole heavy chair? WTF. so frustrating.I don't recommend anyone to buy this thing online."
4,"So far, so good.","At first I thought the ball was going to be too hard but it has been a couple of weeks now and is softening up some. Everyone who sees it is enticed to try it out and the comments are mostly positive. If it works to strengthen my core, I will be so happy I bought it. It went together quite easily and I like the way it rolls. I took the advice on another review to place the locks in the rear which was helpful. So far, I am liking it but take an occasional break to my regular therapy ball without the frame as it is a bit softer still. I am hoping the Gaiam Balance Ball will soften up even more as it is used. I had to add air only once so far. I only wish there would have been included with the package a measuring string of some sort to help me know I have it at the correct optimal size. For now, I am keeping it and using it regularly."
3,balance ball chair,I am a little disappointed with the size of the ball that came with the chair. It causes the chair to be too low to use at my desk. It doesn't look like the picture. The ball is small enough that it slips through the chair frame.
5,Absolutely phenomenal!,"After reading some of the reviews, I had my doubts on this but fortunately, I am 100% happy with the comfort and improved back posture. As someone who sits in a chair 7-8 hours a day and has suffered from lower back pain, I've been looking for something to: ease my back pain, help me with posture, and for something that doesn't cut off circulation to my legs. This chair has satisfied all 3 of those expectations easily!This chair takes about 3 minutes to put together and is typically the same height as a standard office chair. So far so good. My back pain is gone, my neck doesn't hurt, and I feel my core getting stronger each day.I'm very grateful for thoughtful product designs like this that focus on ergonomics rather than how it looks.A few of my office co-workers now want them as well, and I've ordered one for home since I just cannot use an uncomfortable office chair again that causes me back pain.A++ product. No complaints at all! :)"
4,Be careful!,"I love my new chair - but notice a chance to really hurt yourself. If you are used to using exercise balls, you typically reach down and steady the ball before you sit down on it. Well I have nearly caught my finger between the bar you see in the picture across the front of the chair and the ball. When you are not in the chair there is a small gap between the ball and the bar. Then when you sit down the ball expands and presses quite firmly against the bar. So as I said be careful especially if you have little ones around when you are in the chair. My two cents!Gaiam Balance Ball Chair (Black)"
2,Be careful if you are short,"Intrigued by this product I had a lengthy chat with a Gaiam representative because I am short (5'2"") and not very heavy, and wanted it as a desk chair. I was assured that staff at Gaiam of my size used the chair at their desks and were comfortable. I bought it and after a short period am looking for a replacement. Even propping the ""balance ball"" up with a firm pillow underneath (an unsightly solution that needs constant adjustment) my hands are still too low for comfortable use of my computer keyboard. Might be ok if you are around 5'5"" or higher, but if you are small, I definitely advise against this for a functional chair requiring access to desk-high functions, and I believe Giaim ought to say something about this in their ads and through their phone reps."
4,"Good, but short.","I'm 5'9"" and found this to be too short for me. Fotunately, I already had a larger exercise ball that I used instead of the ball that came with the chair -- this works.I do think it's overpriced."
5,Cool chair,"It's not big and bulky, but is a good servicable size to sit in while working on the computer or watching TV. It is comfortable to sit in for quite a stretch of time. I wish it were a little bigger, but I like it anyway."
4,nice,"A perfect chair for what I wanted. I would not say that it is the most comfortable chair, but it improves posture so that even after sitting for a long time, I don't feel fatigued."
3,Not the latest Gaiam version of this chair...this is definitely v1.0,"This is a small chair! Anyone over 5'5"" beware. The ball doesn't even fill out to the bar in the front. And it's not because we havent properly inflated it. the product shown here on amazon is not the latest generation of Gaiam chairs. Thus the price and size issue. Of course direct from Gaiam is only available in a kit with a dvd and a stretch band and way more expensive. Customer service informed me"" The Balance Ball Chair comes prepackaged from the manufacturer and does include all of the parts. We do not have the item available without those at this time. I apologize for any inconvenience. Thank you and have a great day!""I may try to get another ball to see if it fits better. If it doesnt, iat least it can go to the middle school student in the house. ;)"
4,Happy with my decision,"I ordered the balance bar chair because I had been reading about the benefits of using it for better posture, back pain, etc. I'm hoping to get a similar one at work, as well. Other than some initial difficulty in getting the inflation just right for my height, it has worked very well."
1,Nuts,"I cannot rate how this chair actually works because I did not get that far. The chair comes with a thin metal rod with threads at each end that is designed to be bolted to the body of the chair. I presume this metal rod is a key safety feature to the chair to hold the ball on the base. There are four nuts provided with the chair that are supposed to be used to secure the rod to the chair housing. Unfortunately, not one of the nuts would screw onto the rod. They were too small or possibly the paint job on the rod made the treads too thick for the nuts to screw onto. Not even using a wrench other than the flimsy one would allow the nuts to screw onto the rod. I am returning the chair tomorrow."
2,Warning: This product is garbage,"This product is a great idea and I would love a ball to sit on as an alternative to a chair. However, the ball that came with this is ridiculously small and doesn't come above a bar that's designed to keep a bigger ball in place. As a result, it's impossible to sit on. Doesn't look at all like the picture (ball is about half the size). Seems like others have this problem as well. Perhaps you'll get the correctly sized ball. Perhaps not. Roll the dice if you like."
4,Kids love it,I got this for my kids to sit/bounce on while they were doing school work and it works great for that purpose. It's sturdy and durable. My 12 yr old put it together in a few minutes with no problems. It's smaller than I expected which is fine for the kids but not so great for adults. For adults it sits lower than normal IMO.
3,fun but not functional....,"ordered this chair because I was studying for the boards and sitting for lengthy amounts of time studying. At first it was a novelty, great for posture, fun to bounce on when boredom raised its head; but eventually my back wanted to be supported and alas, the meager plastic ""T"" provided is not helpful for this purpose. On the up side, my daughter removes the ball and uses it for pilates so it was not a total waste of money, but frankly, buying the ball alone is a better idea than this chair."
3,concept review only,"Like another reviewer, I set up a balance ball to use as a chair at my desk. Before doing this, I used to have terrible shoulder and neck aches from working at my desk. With my new set-up and improved sitting posture, I feel much better and can work longer. The ball was too low at first, so I put several throw rugs doubled-up underneath. This gives the ball sort of a cradle and it stays put. (But you have to be careful--it can get away from you.) For the price of $29, I have exercise equipment and a good chair for my desk. Exercising while working is possible, too. It's great."
2,Too short for a standard office desk,We bought this for Father's day for my husband. Like the chair but the ball it comes with is too small. It's way to short to use with a standard office desk. Now we will have to buy an additional larger ball so we can use it with the desk.
3,Mixed Emotions,"It seems comfortable for short sessions; however, when I sit on it for 30+ minutes, I find a hard time walking due to lower back pain. If you suffer from posture problems that affect shoulers and neck, I recommend it; if you have lower back problems, I don't."
5,Exactly what I had in mind,"***** Update*****The ball got warm from a space heater and deflated. Ruined. Waaat whaaaa....*******************************************************************************My review is probably not helpful for most but whatever haha. I bought this chair for my office b/c I bring my 3 month old son to work with me. Nothing mellows him out like bouncing on my stability ball at home but that's not very efficient for work. It's totally perfect for multitasking while boinging. I really wish I had one for home for grabbing whatever I inevitability forgot to put within reach (my glasses, water bottle, remote, etc) without interrupting the rhythm.The only things to be aware of are the heavy plasticy smell for about a day and it's very firm for the first week.Great product. Love it."
4,Excersise ball office chair,"i purchased this chair for my office. When it was received, it seemed the ball chair was too low. so i had my desk altered and now its ""almost"" a perfect fit.its very comfortable and keeps my posture straight, and i dont like to sit on hard flat surface as its not good for the Bootie anyways. I think that the ball chairs??? come in different sizes for certain heights and weights? i cant recall if i read that before buying it, i am 5' and this one was a little too low.i tried to put a bigger ball but it didnt work out.All in all.I like it. I made it work.And i definatly reccomend it.thank you"
5,Gaiam Balance Ball Chair,"I purchased this chair for my home office. I love it so much, I am considering purchasing one for my work office. One suggestion, make sure you FULLY inflat the balance ball; it will make a difference in how you sit."
2,plain ball is better,"I had this chair but switched to using a plain ball which was more comfortable. The chair and the ball were too short and didn't move easily. When I bought it they just had the black ball option and the whole chair was too small. The ""backrest"" wasn't doing anything.I ended up buying another (larger) ball. Even though it fit into the chair it was just easier, more comfortable and less hassle using a large ball by itself than using the chair. The plastic is cheap and the wheels don't move. The issue I found with all balls (in or out of a chair frame),is that standard desks can be too high (perhaps more so if you are a short person) and height adjust-ability is very limited with a ball chair. I ended up getting a desk where I could vary the height."
3,review for Gaiam chair,"I am a male...6 feet tall. This ball will work for someone my height.This ball is pretty cool and feels good for the back, but unfortunately, I am not going to use it anymore. It hurts my private region too much.It's the same feeling when sitting on a bike and having all that pressure on your b*lls.Otherwise, easy to put together."
3,Could Be Better,"This ball will help your back if you have to sit a lot of the day at a desk. However, I found the lumbar support not quite ergonomic enough for me as I still need to use one a Miracle Ball or pillow when I want to lean back. This surprises me as it's supposed to have been designed by a chiropractor. I also think the GAIAM company's products are overpriced for what they give you. Walmart carries balance balls for appox 1/2 the price. And the one I bought came with a foot pump inflator, which is so much better than the hand pump. Overall, the chair is sturdy, the wheels roll well and the book of exercises are helpful. However, I feel this chair is only worth $50, not 80.00."
1,Too Short/ Me or the Ball,"I purchased the ball chair with the 55 cm ball, the only size I found available through Amazon. It was advertised to fit someone 5' to someone 5'11"". Being 5'2"" I cannot reach my standard office deskwhen sitting in my new chair. I was told I look like a munchkin behind my desk. It seems unreasonable to hae to purchase another $30.00 ball"
1,I wanted to like this,"I have an L4-5 rupture and it is difficult to find a chair I can use for any extended period of time. I gave this a try for a few hours, based on the recommendations of others. The next day I could barely walk... For my type of back problem, this chair is not a good choice. I have put it out for my children to use, who find it a fun chair for video games, so all is not lost."
4,Balance ball chair review,I really like the product. It's extremely versatile in that I can lean on the back rest or just balance in the middle of the ball. I can and have sat on the product for 8 or more hours at a stretch working at the computer in my home office. I believe that this product is far superior to any chairs I've used in the past or just using a balance ball which I've also done.
5,GREAT CHAIR,"This is the 2nd balance chair I have purchased. I was so happy with the first one that I bought the second one for my other work desk. I can sit all day sometimes up to 12 hours and have no back pain whatsoever. I don't know why or how it works, but it works great for me!"
3,No miracle,"I bought this chair because my doc recommended for good posture. However, I found that it doesn't do miracles. Since you couldn't lean on the back, it does not force perfect posture. What you have to do is to adjust the computer screen, the keyboard, the mouse to make them at the correct height and positions.The quality is good for the price though."
3,Chair great---BUT.....,"I loved this chair!! Perfect for posture and for abs - subtle help, but over time it makes a real difference. HOWEVER, after about 8 months, the ball stopped holding air. No holes, couldn't figure out why. Wrote to the company. Yes, they have a replacement. Sent me one - wrong size; sent a second one - wrong size; sent a third, WRONG SIZE!!! Sent a letter to the President of the company to seek help -- NO ANSWER!!!! I won't buy from a company whose President doesn't offer some sort of comment to a dissatisfied customer. If you can find this chair made by another company - buy it! But, while Giaim has helpful customer service people, they can't always solve the problems and the company President is unresponsive."
2,USED Gaiam Ball Chair,Don't buy a this item USED. The ball did not hold air and the pump broke. The base is great so I purchased another ball. Now it is quite comfortable.
1,Gaiam Ball Balance Chair: poor quality,"the item is defective. I received no invoice or any papers to tell me how to return it to you. the pump does not work for the ball, air escapes and I cannot inflate the ball to the needed height. also the back support (or whatever it is is not secure) .I am very dissatisfied and want to return the item. I had no way to contact anyone as there was no invoice in the package at all.Please contact me ASAP.Thanks,Barbara McLaughlin"
5,Ball chairs are the best!,"We bought two of these to sit in when doing puzzles to replace just a loose fitness ball and ordinary chair. We were amazed that they slid in nicely under the table even though we lowered the table a bit as we are both under 5'5"". You just don't get tired sitting in a ball chair. You are constantly moving about.They sell these on the web for as much as $199!!! Gaim sells 'em for $99.Buy them here and enjoy. You should be under 6 feet - the shorter the better I think. Just blow it up to suit your height."
2,Haven't used it once since we bought it.,"I bought this chair as a gift for my husband. He put the chair together but he hasn't used it since he constructed it 4 months ago. I am thinking about taking it apart and selling it again. The reviews for the chair seemed like a great ergonomic solution to back problems and too much sitting in the office. However, at 6'2"" the chair just doesn't work for him. The ball also seems extremely small, even for me at 5'4"". Reviews that I read said that with wear the ball would stretch out and would allow more air to inflate the ball and increase it's size... but we haven't even gotten that far since no one wants to sit on it. Looks cool in the picture, but looks cheap in real life."
2,?,I purchased this chair a couple weeks ago and I wished I wouldn't have spent the money. Not worth it. I believe it would be better if the plastic pieces were solid instead of hollow. That would make it more durable and longer lasting.
4,Ball Chair,"I really like this but would like a bit larger ball. I have a 55 cm ball and it is too large, the 52 cm one is a bit small. I find, if I sit properly, that I have no arm strain (no arm rests!) and no back strain. This was an ongoing problem with my regular office chair. I have just spent long hours doing date entry and no problems. I do need to get up and walk around every hour or two for a bit."
4,Pleased with product,I really like this product. It forces me to have good posture...that's a good thing. I received the chair a month ago and I am still waiting on a part that wasn't included in the shipment.
2,Tiny,"Despite the description that this is suitable for heights between 5'5"" and 5'11"", when I assembled it and fully inflated the ball, it was about 4 inches too low to use on a standard sized desk (I'm 5'8""). You'll need at least a 65"" ball, maybe bigger, for this to be a usable desk chair."
3,It's okay,"The assembly was really simple. The material used is not that steady. I found that the ball is very firm even if you deflate some air. Also, it gets very cold. I kept the towel over it to prevent the heat loss from my body. When you seat in the ball at first it appears to be very comfortable but after few hours you really need to work on it to make sure your posture is correct. Seating in the chair for prolong time will make your bottom muscle to get stiff and it will force you to get up every few hours. Seating in the office for 8 hours straight with really uncomfortable office chair made my posture really bad. I was constantly slouching. It was really hard at first to find the right position but once I got used to, it really help to correct my posture. Also, I paid more attention to the way I seat in any other chair."
3,Ball isn't right size,"Well the balance ball is about 1/3 to a 1/2 size smaller than the picture shows for it to be. Instructions said it could take up to 48 hours for the ball the relax and give some room for more air, but it's been 4 days and no difference."
1,Parts Missing,"My chair was received without all of the parts. I was told that I could send back the chair and get a refund. Keep the chair (that I can't put together) at a 10% discount. Or send the chair back and get a new one in 3-5 weeks. It only took me 2 weeks to get it the first time. Instead of offering service (free expedited shipping, faster delivery, etc), I got customer service agents regurgitating computer automated responses. The chair may be nice when it's put together, but I wouldn't know."
4,Had to purchase for a job,"I previously sat on just the ball for 5yrs, got a new job and they required you have an actual chair to sit on with locks on the wheels. Got this and it does the job, it's nice becaue it doesn't roll away when you get up like when you uuse the ball only!~"
4,"Good, but not Perfect","After quite a bit of use, the ball still seems hard. It's not as comfortable as my plain stability ball. However, the wheels are a HUGE improvement over the plain stability ball. I recommend this product to those that have tried a stability ball but want more freedom to roll around the office."
3,Not your ordinary chair,Do NOT expect this to be a normal chair. I was getting wrist pain because I was sitting wrong and leaning on the desk instead of keeping myself supported by the chair. This chair will take some getting used to. It is low to the ground in that it is designed that your upper leg is parallel to the floor. Right now I use it a few hours a day and then go back to my other chair. Like rocking exercise shoes it is all about your body supporting itself and balance. There is a exercise book included but aligning your body is something you should concentrate on first. I may give it a higher rating as time goes on but I wanted to put up a first impressions review. I would not hesitate to buy it. I am enjoying it but you have to get used to sitting properly.
3,Best for a smaller adult.,The chair arrived on time and went together easily. The directions for the ball indicate it may look small at first but that you add some more air a couple days later. I did this but it still looks about 15 % smaller than the photo and seems to sit a bit short. Still it is quite comfortable and would be especially appropriate for a smaller adult. Great value.
5,Gaiam Ball Chair,"Really Love This Chair!Not only does my back feel better, but now that I am used to sitting on it, it's extremely comfortable."
4,great chair even though...,"The only disappointment is that the yoga ball, upon delivery, was smaller than pictured. Other than that, very comfortable and useful."
3,Keeps Good Posture in Your Head,"I used to cross my legs all the time which is why I purchased this chair. It's not that I *can't* cross my legs while sitting on it (in fact, I have) but the chair keeps sitting with correct posture in the forefront of my mind now. I also have nothing to lean back on with this chair, there's no back rest, so that, again, makes me more mindful of sitting correctly.Im not sure it's as helpful as just the balance ball (without the base) would be for strengthening abdominal and back muscles but for the purpose *I* wanted it for, it was okay.There's another review I had read (which I took into consideration before I buoght the chair) so just as an ""FYI"", my muscles weren't sore after the first few days as this user's were. My *butt* hurt from sitting on rubber all day but after the first day, that went away & all was fine."
5,Recommended for anyone,"This is the best chair I have ever used. I would recommend it for anyone, whether you have back issues or not. It takes a few days to get used to it and I would strongly recommend keeping your original chair for about a week until you can use this one all the time. I never have a sore back, neck or shoulders using this chair and I'm in front of a computer most of the day. When you get the chair, the ball looks way too small. After you've pumped it up a couple of times, it stretches to fit the chair. I would recommend buying your own pump though as the one I got broke before I had finished pumping the ball the first time. The pump was my only issue with this and considering the benefits - big deal! I would choose this chair over a regular office chair any day of the week."
5,Excellent office chair!,I have had this for five months now - I cannot believe what a difference it has made. It has significantly improved my posture and reduced my back aches from spending too much time in front of the computer. I highly recommend this for anyone. It is extremely stable and sturdy too.
4,"Good Product, Clever Design","This ball chair is quite good. The entire chair is very light and easy to move around. One can get a decent toning by just sitting down.The design is quite clever: simple and works well.The only complain I have for this product is that one of the locking back casters kept locking itself, and I had to tape it back."
4,great idea but low for a chair,"I like the idea of a balance ball chair but it was really low for my normal-height desk, so my shoulders were hunched up typing. Blowing up the ball fully did not help. So I ended up buying the next larger sized ball at Sports Authority and now the chair works well, even if I am a bit high for the desk."
3,Not bad at all,I received the chair with the elevator attachment today.It was assembled in less than 5 minutes.Pro: Comfortable to sit on.Con: 1.The back rest is way too low to do any meaningful exercise for the back.2. The supplied pump leaks air as you pump air in. Better design of this will help.Overall : Satisfied
3,Love chair but not the ball,I enjoy the ball chair but the ball popped after 6 months of regular use. It just developed a small hole in the side. It may have been punctured from something but the ball was used for its normal intended use and I expected a little more. I will order a new ball for the chair but I'm a little frustrated at the lack of quality in the original ball.
4,"Wonderful chair, one small problem","I received a Gaiam Balance Ball chair as a gift and love it, but likewise had to replace the stability ball: they don't appear on the Gaiam company web site (why?), but can be ordered by phone (877-989-6321) for $15.00 plus shipping. The item number is 95-1036."
1,High hopes...low satisfaction,"As a fan of the stability ball for exercising, I was hopeful that this chair would relieve or help prevent my back pain at work. It did help me maintain a better posture, however the cheap plastic of the chair is so squeaky that it is very annoying to those around me in the office. Also, the ball ruins the fabric on my skirts and dress pants. I think it must be pinching the fabric whenever I move or get up as the rubber stretches."
2,Not as great as I expected,"I have hip and knee problems and was experiencing some discomfort in my regular office chair so I decided to give the balance ball chair a try. Personally, it caused an increase in my pain specifically in my hips and lower back. I think the problem may be the back support bar, which as another reviewer mentioned, is removable. I have been using just a plain large balance ball as my chair the past few weeks and like it much better, so you might want to give that a try before you purchase the whole chair get-up."
2,Not what I had hoped for...,"I received the product in an appropriate amount of time, but am sorely disappointed with the chair. It sits too low to use comfortably at my computer and offers no muscle toning while I sit on it b/c you automatically recline on the lumbar support bar. Its not comfortable and hurts my hips when I get up. Plus the bar extends out well past the ball, and therefore my legs are always backed up against the cold metal. And yes, I got the larger of the 2 balls. Great concept though!!!"
2,Too small,This chair is a good idea but it sits much too low to be used at a desk. The ball is way too small. I had to return the chair.
4,Great Chair,This chair is fun to sit on. I really like the fact you can roll around your office from one end to the other. I have a calcified disk in my back and it has helped with my posture and when I am in pain. I am sitting on it 85% of the time now.
4,Balance Ball Chair,"I was recommended by a physical therapist to use this chair to obtain relief from neck issues. It is very comfortable providing adequate back support but with greatly diminished stress to the lower back resulting in relief to my neck area. The only thing I miss from a traditional office chair is the arms to rest my elbows on; however, I am practicing new ergonomic techniques and find that I would not use them anyway. Great product, highly recommend!"
4,I love my new chair - it rocks!,"I have back problems and this chair has helped me sit correctly and now my back doesn't hurt as much. It forces you to sit up in the correct postion and I really like that part. I am a sloucher so it really helps me not to do that anymore. I highly recommend this to anyone who's job entails a lot of sitting.The only thing that I don't like about it is the wheel locks. They seem to always be on and then I have to reach down and unlock them. The ball was hard to blow up, so you will need access to an air compressor. The pump that comes with it would take hours to pump it up."
3,A Novelty Seat,"It's comfortable, good height for a desk. Would be better with a higher backrest. Wheels for moving around are just OK quality. It's good for a second chair to use when you need a change."
1,Disappointed,"I am disappointed because I have not been able to sit in the chair. I can't screw the nuts onto the support bar; the nuts are too small. I couldn't even fit them on using a ""grown-up"" pair of pliers. Is there a way to get replacement nuts without having to return the whole chair? Thank you."
2,ball chair,"was shipped and received within a 2-week period, it was easy to assemble, all of the components seem sturdy, having the wheels to get around was a huge plus over the stationary exercise ball; however, the ball was too small for me."
2,missing part,There was no pump..........the write-up had that was a pump in the box but none was there soon Christmas morning there was no chair as it could not be assembled.:(Gaiam Balance Ball Chair
2,too smalll,I have seen this balance ball chair so when I opened the box I was expecting it to be big. Instead it is child size. Nowhere did it give the size and I didn't know they came in a small size. This is for a child.I need to return it. Also the box had been opened and resealed it was not brand new.
4,can't complain,"All in all, I am satisfied with the chair. I haven't found it hard to balance on, and it does force me to sit upright. Sometimes I find myself 'cheating' and leaning back on the backrest, but if I want I can always remove it. Also I've found that the metal bar in front is unnecessary; the ball stays put just fine without it. And one more thing: the chair is made of hollow plastic which increases the jenk factor a little bit. But hey, you get what you pay for."
5,40 hours per week on the ball,The Gaiam Balance ball was referred to me by a friend (thank U Suzy) so I went to their web site and checked it out but when I reviewed the pricing decided to shop around for the same product and found it on Amazon. I bought it there due to a special sale as well as free shipping that turned out to be 2 day Fed Ex and saved $70. I am extremely happy with my chair. The only change I would make to it (and may still do myself) is to have better rollers for it. I am on it 40 hours a week at my office cubicle for a month now and I need it as I have an injury to my sacrum causing pinched nerves and pain in my hips and legs if I sit for 40 hours on my expensive adjustable office chair. The ball is strengthening my core and I am not in as much pain now. Totally worth the money!
2,Not good if you have lower back problems,"I purchased this chair hoping to strengthen my abs and back to alleviate recurring low back pain. Unfortunately, it has actually made the problem worse. It seemed like a logical thing to do at the time: purchase a chair that's going to give ""correct posture"" , etc., but it turns out the what's correct posture for one person can be incorrect for someone else. Unfortunately, the Gaiam Balance Ball Chair does not allow for the level of adjustablility needed for me to sit comfortably in an office situation."
4,Comfortable,"This is a great ball for working at the computer.I have a bad back and I feel this chair is really helping me strengthen my core.Note: Don't throw away your old chair, after about 5 hours of sitting you may feel like taking a break from sitting on this chair. Overall, thoguh, it's comfortable and recommended!"
4,Balance Ball Chair,Gaiam Balance Ball Chair (Black)Very good chair if you're the type that tends to slouch. You are forced to sit properly. I like it if I don't need to sit at my computer for hours. I tend to get a stiff lower back if I have to sit for more than an hour on this chair. Love that I can remove the ball to do exercises. I've had this chair almost 2 years and it has held up to abuse from 3 young children who love to climb.
3,Balance ball chair review,"While I found the chair very comfortable, it was to short for me to reach my desk. A bigger ball may have worked. I am short so a taller person may do fine with this. I ended up returning the product."
4,Comfortable,I use this at my office and find it very comfortable. I have lower back problems and it seems to be easier on my back than a regular chair.
5,Nice,Love this chair I sit at a desk all day and it is very comfortable I can not complain tho every one wants to steal it :)
3,Gaiam Balance Ball Chair,I bought this on a lark but it sure did help me to keep my bad back streight. If you are sitting for hrs on end at a computer then this is for you. You learn good balance too. I enjoyed using it but my office is small with 2 large desks an requires 2 chairs. This took up too much space in this tiny room along with the other desk chair so I had to sell it. But had I had more room I would still have it. It looks silly but its fun to use. If ya want a chair thats different an comfortble this is for you. TAke the ball off an you have an exercise ball! Syl in Texas
4,Happy,gift recipient is happy so far; have not assembled completely because it is going back to college after break. Like that there are exercise routines included.Fun gift.
4,"Durable, keeping my back straight","Only complaint is that provided wrench too weak for nuts. Otherwise, easy set up, useful exercise manual, wheels that work, great product."
5,Best desk chair out there,"I bought this chair for my desk at school. I teach 5th grade, and while I don't get to sit down much when I do this chair rocks! It is the most comfortable chair I have ever sat in. It rolls great and is so supportive on my back. Lots of my fellow teachers have seen the chair and after getting over the initial shock and trying it have decided to purchase on themselves. You can not go wrong with this chair. I love it and you will too!"
3,Ball too small,I bought this chair because the 55 cm balance ball I was using was too small for use with my desk. I read several of the reviews before purchasing this item and they mentioned that the ball was too small for the chair.When I received the product and set up the chair imagine how disappointed I was when the balance ball that came with the chair was also too small. So much for wishful thinking.With that said I did notice that there is a new version of the chair with adjustable legs. Maybe this will be a better option. I would only buy this product again if it was priced at a deep discount. If its regular price then just buy the adjustable height version.
4,Ball is smaller than one pictured!,I recently received the chair and enjoy using it since it helps with posture while at the computer. My complaint is that it came with a smaller ball than the one in the picture. Since I am over 6 feet and I feel it is on the low side unfortunately. I did not see an option for the larger ball but will inquire.
3,Ball was too small,The ball that came with the chair was TINY. It looked nothing at all like the picture so I had to spend an additional $20 to buy a ball that worked for me to sit at my desk.Seriously disappointing.
1,Ball chair,I have not been as happy with this product as I thought I would be. It is difficult to sit down and it puts my hips in an uncomfortable position. Sitting on this chair feels rather precarious and I don't find it to be a relaxed way to sit.
1,Item is misrepresented,"This item is not big enough for adults, it is for a child. The pamphlet that comes with it shows a different sized chair and ball that does fit adults. This item is totally misrepresented. And a larger ball does not fit correctly on the chair base with the back in place. An adult cannot do the exercises nor sit up high enough to utilize this product as advertised. The chair is very unsafe on a non carpeted surface, it will fly out from underneath you if you do not have the 2 wheel locks set. Note that even with the wheel locks set the chair can still roll."
3,Bouncing ! ! !,"The ball and firm back rest have been good for my legs and backwhen spending long stretches at the computer. I feel thechair is much overpriced when compared to other office chairsof much better quality. The wheels and locks are not the best.The wheel base is a bit too broad making it difficult to move around easily in a confined area. Overall, I am glad to have it."
5,Love this chair!,"I really like this chair. Very comfortable. Easy to scoot around on. My lower back feels better, and I sit up straighter at my desk."
4,Useful,"It's fun to take a break while working to do some stretching exercises and crunches etc. on the ball separately. I noticed that my butt gets sore after just regularly (relaxingly) sitting on it for a while. It's the kind of sore of just sitting on a chair too long, not from working out. But otherwise, I like being able to feel like my posture is better and that I can easily work out just by sitting at the computer."
1,Disappointed,"One of my coworkers had one of these chairs and I really liked it so ordered one. When it came it had the small balance ball in the kit and not the medium ball which is required to properly fill out the base of the chair and give you proper height. The product picture shows the chair with the medium ball. The small ball they sent is pretty laughable. I called the customer service number I found online. I got someone in the Phillipines and we had difficulty communicating due to the accent. He told me he would send me out a new chair but when it came, it was exactly the same with a small balance ball which will not work in the chair. Now, I will have to call him back and get a return label to send the chair back. I have decided to keep the first chair since I have a medium balance ball that will work, but the price of the chair includes a ball. Very disappointed."
2,Tiny,"This chair is tiny, not sure who the target audience is for this product or its use. I think this must be for children to use on a small play table. I ordered the leg extenders but I am not that optimistic. Probably better off just buying a normal pilates ball and calling it a day. The ball that comes with this is about 25% the size of the orginal pilates ball. This picture is deceiving."
3,Interesting product,"I have mixed feelings on the balance chair. My team of 3 people all ordered the chairs. We do sit up straighter, but have experienced back pains as well. I'm not sure why they charge $80 for the chair... it's just a ball on a cheap plastic frame, but I guess that's what new ideas sell for. If I had to do it again, I would make sure to have a chair to alternate with, since it's only tollerable for a portion of the day. We have gotten more used to them as we use them longer, but it's still a bit uncomfortable to sit on a rubber ball all day.By the end of the day, we are sitting in even more contorted positions than we would on a normal chair, so it's important to be very dedicated to good posture. We've only had them for a few weeks, so I haven't noticed any difference to my core strength yet."
3,This is not adjustable,"No matter what I do, I cannot seem to sit in this chair correctly. I have more, not less, upper back pain using this chair at my work station. Part of the issue is that the base is not adjustable and therefore is too low for my standard sized desk. I do use the ball in my office for excerises and stretching and my co-workers are always amused that it is the guest chair in my office now."
5,If I could Sleep on this chair I would!,Okay I have to say I have never written a review on Amazon until now. I am so in love. I love this chair more than anything. I have HORRIBLE sciatica and this week it has been so bad it reduces me to a blithering pile of tears and curse word. I also work from home and spend hours on the computer. I have to or I won't get paid. This chair feels amazing on my back. I feel 500 times better instantly!! Worth every penny and that says a lot because the damn thing went on sale on Black Friday 3 days after I bought it. I was kinda irked but now it's here and I could care less how much I paid for it. I love it. I'm going to be whispering tales of love to it for the rest of the week. Buy it. You will be glad you did. I had a regular yoga ball I have sat on for the last 2 years and that was cool but this is WAAAAAY better.
3,Balance Ball Chair,The transaction went okay. I recieved it quickly. However the pump that came with the ball was broke :-( and not fixable. Thank goodness I have a bike pump.
5,Love the chair,This chair is great to sit on. Everyone that enters our house just has to sit on it and loves it.
4,Nice,"I really liked this, but adter a week I had to send it back...it's too short and even though it helped my lower spine, it was jamming up my shoulder. Check the height of your desk and make sure you measure - cause you can't over inflate the ball to make up the height....it wont work properly."
3,Ball too small,"I like the idea of this chair. I purchased it to use at work while pregnant because HR did not like me just sitting on a regular ball with no support, liability issue. However, the ball that comes with the chair was too small and I had to purchase another one in order to be able to reach my desk."
3,Too short,I purchased this chair with ball based upon a recommendation from a colleague at work. The quality of the chair is okay I had to get a replacement part for the bar that goes across the front of the chair and the company was very willing to send it to me almost as if this happens quite frequently. The biggest problem though is that the ball is too short so if I sit at my desk with the chair Its a not so friendly ergonomic position that I'll probably end up with carpal tunnel. I'm going to try buying a larger ball and see if that will fit in the chair. I am 5'10 but I don't think that is so tall that I should be a good 6 inches too short of my desk
2,Reality wasn't as good as my imagination,"I imagined myself gleefully bouncing along on my ball chair day in and day out. Reality was far less appealing. First, I always felt like I ended up slouching, vice the promised good posture. While I am certain I burned extra calories during the day, fighting to stay on my chair wasn't my idea of ""exercise"" at all. The back on this chair, which is really a misnomer considering the fact that it doesn't function like a chair back, broke after I leaned on it... which was both difficult and uncomfortable.Best of luck to anyone that feels the need to try this. In theory I think it is a good idea, I'm just not sure how reasonable it is in application. I switched back to a normal chair at work and gave this to my son."
4,Awesome,"I work 50+ hours a week on the computer and this chair is awesome. My back hurts less and I've lost 5 lbs over a period of a couple weeks. All of the people in my office started ordering these as well because its so much more comfortable then ""ergonomic"" junk.Do not worry about over filling the ball. When it doesn't fit in the holder then let some air out. If it feels too small, pump it full of air.The only thing I can think of as a con is that the holder is a little strange at first but you get used to it over time."
4,Excellent Chair!,"Brought this for use at work. Due to a herniated disc in my lower back, when I sit for prolonged periods of time, I frequently get very stiff.I have been using the balance ball for 3 weeks now and have noticed I don't get stiff and my core strength has greatly improved. Would highly recommend. However, you have to make sure your computer monitor is high enough so that your neck is not strained and your eyes are not looking down at your monitor."
5,Balance Ball chair,"I really like the chair. However, the small, useless pump that comes with it is not worth including in the package. I had bought a similar chair a couple of years ago and there was a pump that looked like a turkey baster that worked better than this one, even though it took quite a while to inflate the ball."
4,GREAT PURCHASE!,"I received this about an hour ago and followed all the directions on putting it together. It was very simple. The ball I received is smaller than the ball pictured. I called amazon to inquire about replacing my ball but they told me that they couldn't just ""replace the ball"" and I needed to ship the whole chair back. I just want a new ball, the chair is fine. I am 5'7 and I did not need the additional blocks to add height.***I have now had this for 4 days and the ball has ""stretched"" and needed more air, therefore it is the right ball being delivered, just needs a few days to adjust. I have NO back pain and my posture has improved. I can feel my abdominal and leg muscles working while sitting on this. GREAT PURCHASE! If you sit at a desk 9+ hours a day, invest in this chair."
1,Balance Ball Chair,"I have a lot of friends who have this chair and love it, but my broke before I could even sit in it. The wheel broke in half. I returned this chair because I felt it was a little cheaply made."
2,Small,"If you see the girl in the Picture at the desk it looks nice but, to a normal desk your seting on the ground and your head is all thats over top the desk, so if you like type with your hands over your head its fine."
4,Chair Me!,I like long walks on the beach and a beer in my hand. Oh yea.....this chair works and is what I expected. That is all.
3,A cheaper option,"Why not simply get an Aero disc and place it on your regular office chair? then it rolls around with no problem. You are still challenged with the balancing thing and sitting upright, but much less weird-looking and a lot cheaper (that is if you already have an office chair)."
2,Gaiam Balance Ball Chair,"This was actually a workout to put together--the instuctions were pretty vague & I ended up using a different pump to pump the ball up. The hand pump was very slow & since I suffer from carpel tunnel syndrom the foot pump that I had worked much better.While the chair feels comfortable, I have found that I need to build my time up on it slowly. After having back pain, I decided to limit the use to an hour a day & gradually build up the time. I now use it until my back, my feet or my thighs start hurting. I'm up to an hour and a half at a time after two weeks.I may be more cautious than most; I started using a balance ball for a chair two years ago & then developed plantar facitis because of the stress that I ended up unwittingly putting on my feet.I'll keep trying to build the time up, but I think there should be some warnings about taking it slow."
3,Much Smaller Than Advertised,"The order arrived quickly and packaged well. The chair was simple to assemble and came with a good booklet of exercises. However, the ball is MUCH smaller than the picture leads on. It works well for my computer desk but way too short for my office desk. Wish it came with either a taller ball or an adjustable frame. Will keep it since it was on sale and my company reimbursed me for half the cost."
3,"Good Concept, Small Flaw","I use this chair in my classroom for students who have trouble sitting still, as it allows them to feel more comfortable. While I think it is a great concept, the ball popped after several months of use and I am going to have to purchase a replacement ball -- but I can't find one."
3,Good & Bad,"This chair didn't work for me. My desk at work is too low and has too narrow of a chair opening for it to help me out. I had to let enough air out of the ball in order to sit at the correct level, which made the ball too flat, which caused severe hip pain. I couldn't figure out why my hips were aching, so I took the chair away and went back to my old one. Within a week the hip pain was nearly gone.The chair did help my upper back/shoulders and made me very aware of my posture. Overall it helped me simply because it forced me to sit up straight and keep my shoulders from rolling forward. My middle/upper back feels stronger now due to my improved posture, and my improved posture continues to help strengthen the muscles this area."
2,Gaiam Balance Ball Chair,"I am disappointed with this product. I am a Pilates instructor and know the benefits of this chair for back issues, posture and the like. I am 5 feet 3 inches and with the chair assembled it is soooooo low to the floor I have had to place a large bed pillow under the ball to make it the appropriate height (knee to hip alignment) I wish there was a way to adjust the heigth. It is fine now but inconvenient."
1,Disappointed,"The chair was way too short for my desk at work, which is a standard office desk. The ball deflated pretty quickly, and when I tried to use the included pump, it broke. I returned the chair."
2,I do not really use it,"I bought it because I have back problems, but it ended up filling up space and hardly ever being used. I should have known the difference between ""I want it"" and ""I really need it"". The ball deflates, one of the brakes broke off (even though it has not been used much)... I also do not like the cheap plastic finish, it clashes with my much nicer furniture.I have just sat on it to try it again, but the back support is not very comfortable and it moves if you lean on it, but I will admit that it does prevent me from slouching.Update: I have thrown the base out and kept the ball, in case I decide to sit on it one day. A lady who lives down the street picked it up and uses it as a transport for her trash can. So I guess it's useful afterall."
1,Ball is too small,"I am in Afghanistan and ordered this chair in an attempt to help me with the back pain caused by 15-16 hour days here at work. I received the chair three days ago and unfortunately am unable to use it. The ball is half the size as the photos depicted here on Amazon and also on the box/instructions that I received. I wish I could take a photo and upload it. The instructions indicate that I was supposed to give it 24-48 hours and allow the ball to relax so I could inflate it more. I did so and it still isn't big enough to fill the space provided and therefore be used. Because I am in Afghanistan, it's not easy to just rush right down to the post office to send it back. I thought about trying to just order a replacement ball but am afraid to spend another $20-$30 and have that be a waste as well after I just wasted $80 on the chair. Highly disappointed that I have this $80 piece of junk just sitting here alongside my desk collecting dust."
1,Have yet to like a Gaiam product despite their hype,"I had a temporary office job where the only chairs available were these. At first I was excited because I've heard about these and very much wanted to try it. After using this product daily for 6 months you couldn't pay me to sit on one now. I soon found myself slouching worse than ever to compensate for the complete lack of back support. Just sit up straight in your normal chair and you'll be fine. Oh, and it's a cheap, plastic, poorly designed thing that should cost about $15. All four wheel locks were broken and don't expect yours to last long."
2,stick with a ball,"I just purchased this chair to replace a balance ball that i have been using as a desk chair for about a year. Frankly, i prefer the real thing. The ball without the chair 'frame' gives me more mobility, is more comfortable and is cheaper. For my money, i'd skip the frills and just sit on your ball. One caution, you do need to be mindful when you get up and down as you seat can/will fly out from under you at times. Makes life interesting! ( -:"
4,Hard to pump up fully,"This product came very promptly and was pretty much as described. The only minus is that the ball is somewhat hard to pump up to full tautness, which means that when you sit on it, the ball will sink down a little and make it lower than a standard chair. Other than that it seems to be a good product. My 9-year-old son needs to strengthen his trunk muscles, and he doesn't mind sitting on it when he's using the computer."
3,"""top of the class example of how it's done and how to do it""","The Cyberden (10/98) Idiot Stare - The Hate Cage - (Bodybag Productions) - Long time ago'ers STG morphed around and became Idiot Stare - The sound now on The Hate Cage is that crisp and clean, L.A. hard and fast electronic industrial. Entertaining, top of the class example of how it's done and how to do it. You better be into this kind of abuse however as we're talking pit potential here given the crowd at the time is willing to do that kind of thing. Bottom line is that Idiot Stare sounds like Hate Dept., only with more hate and faster. Is that a good thing? Review by Bat"
1,"repeat, repeat, repeat","This book was a disappointment because the puzzles are the same ones that were in the last 500 Sunday Times puzzle book I purchased. Good, perhaps, for people with dimentia."
5,A compelling view of another world...,"This book outlines the world of mots, mors and chooks that takes you deeper into the way the author thinks. I have been a fan of Chris Rowley for some time now, such to the point were I'd like to find out how to send him fan mail. ;)If you are sick of the ink-and-paper doggerel being spewed out of popular printing presses, you will probably enjoy Christopher Rowley's unique books..."
4,Good reliable printer; Good price,"I already have 8 of these printers in my office and just purchased another one for a new employee. We have had them for a year and are very pleased. No breakdowns, great clear print, fast and easy to use. I bought a printer from Dell at the beginning and sent it back because the single paper/envelope feed was a joke - impossible to use. This printer works great whether you are using the general paper trays or the single paper feed. My highest recommendations."
1,Smearing & lousy front loader,This printer stinks on ice. The front loader is at such an angle that you have to stand up to see if the paper is down low enough to trigger the paper feed. It constantly gets stuck on the feeder. The ink smears so badly on letterhead envelopes that I have to put tape over it so it won't rub off. You can't print on any paper other than the cheap copy paper or it will smear terribly. If I would have known of the smearing problem I would not have purchased it. Save your money.
1,A piece of junk.,A piece of junk. Either the networking is flaky or the sheets don't feed very well. I stick with the oldies but goodies for HP: HP 4000 series laserjet printers. You can get gently used ones off eBay for $250 with shipping. Rock solid unlike these clunkers.
1,HP printers used to be wonderful,I own 6 HP laserjet printers. I have had HP printers since 1984. I will not purchase HP printers in the future because their technical support is so bad. My last experience with HP nonsupport wasted an hour and ended with them trying to sell me a new printer. I was able to solve my problem by purchasing a parallel connector PCI card from amazon. The experience still cost me $49 plus tax even though HP did not solve my problem.
1,Crap Service,"Printer did not work. got the run around from the supplier and told to contact HP.HP stated ""Out of Warranty"", eventually help to get it fixed.Last printer i buy from Amazon."
2,"Poor Quality, Smearing Issue Cannot Be Resolved","After spending an hour on the phone with HP support regarding smearing issues, I was told that this machine is designed to use a maximum 20 lb. paper, not bond paper. If I leave the back of the machine open, enough heat may be generated to make the toner set better, but if I sent a sample of my paper...I thanked the young Indian man and called sales to get the number for Mission Control, the support number here in the U.S. (888-943-8476). They attempted to send me back to India, but I refused to go and encourage everyone in the U.S.A. to use Mission Control and refuse to be transferred outside the country. It's fun to hear them say, ""serious?"" And the door to my 2015 won't remain closed all the way, so I have to hold the door shut. It's less than 2 weeks old. To say it's poor quality is putting it mildly. The Nova I drove in high school was built more solidly than this."
5,Solid Workhorse,We use this printer in a small/medium sized business. It is very reliable and networks well using a shared connection. We have very little maintenance on it other then changing out the toner cartridge every now and then. Very nice crisp black print and we have never had a jam to my knowledge.Only problem ever reported was when the person's PC that this printer was hooked to got turned off and no one could print. Turned on the PC and everyone was back up and printing.
2,Big problems running it on a Mac,"I purchased the 2015 as a replacement for the predecessor (whatever the designation was). Installation was a cinch. But trying to print documents from Word or Powerpoint that contained JPG's and text was not successful. The pictures get clipped mysteriously at their right end side!! Also all pictures that were developed with Word Art!!No way I could correct the problem. Not by installing the latest drivers, nor by trying various configurations from the printer menu!The only way I could correctly print was using Gimp drivers. But then quality suffers a lot.There's no practical way to contact HP support quickly. Their support is bad!It was the last printer I ever will buy from HP."
2,Must Read About This Printer!!!,"As much as I initially loved this product, after about a year, it's been giving me a lot of trouble. After doing much research, there seems to be lots of issues with the formatter board, the Jammed and Toner light will stay lit and nothing will print. People are having issues between 2-18 months of owning this printer. And since HP has discontinued this model, the formatter board isn't even sold on their site anymore, you'll probably have to find this part from a third party, ranging from $100-$150.It's a great printer at the beginning, but you'll wind up with more headaches with having to deal with HP's Tech Support/purchasing the formatting board and installing the part. Skip this printer, buy something else."
2,Not a good printer,"The P2015 was just released when we purchased it and HP support had no info and couldn't help. When they finally could help, they sent a new cartridge to fix the very light gray printing that it exhibited. That worked, but the printer never could print on thick labels. The toner didn't set and the text rubbed off. We developed a work-around that was somewhat satisfactory: we ""printed"" the labels a second time as a document with no text. HP replaced our first P2015 with another at no cost. However, the second developed the same problem after several months. Now it prints several horizontal stripes across each page. The P2015 is now listed as discontinued on the HP web site."
5,Down to the Sea in Ships,"It's so fulfilling to find the complete history behind the preeminent artist life story. The sea and the fishermen [dorymen] who lived that lifestyle are certainly represented in the highest by this artist. It seems that God Almighty allowed this man the extra years necessary to express his great love for the sea and the men who go down to the sea in ships. Wonderfully, completely illustrated!"
5,Great art and History in a beautiful work,"Beautiful, amzing work of Mr. Hoyne bringing back to life the heroic saga of these long gone fishermen and their boats!"
4,Fascinating and important,the concept of this book is profound and much needed among mature believers. Every pastor or lay person who has ever or will ever (think everyone) converse with a broken soul needs to read this. I would caution however that the content of this book is not for those whose souls are freshly damaged. Use wisdom with these concepts and allow some healing before imparting the hard truths of this book.
5,Classic.,"Clean and absolutely original humor. I was literally laughing the entire time. IF YOU WATCH ANY MOVIES, WATCH THIS ONE."
3,Good enough though...,I prefer Huggies pull-ups. I never liked Huggies diapers but Huggies definately make better pull-ups.
5,Excellent Value,My son uses these paint balls to shoot at targets in our backyard. They are excellent for practice and seem accurate enough. All of the paint balls arrived in tact.
4,Great basic phone,"I've owned this phone for two years now and have been very impressed with it's call quality. The incoming sound is great - just about like a corded phone. The phone is static free in my two bedroom apartment. The keys have a nice solid feel and the handset has a nice weight to it (feels comfortable for long calls). I've changed the battery once (it does need charging every other day). It does have one weird problem. Sometimes it doesn't ring on the first ring. I highly recommend it for a cheap basic phone. ... I know it's discontinued, but it's still widely available on the internet new."
1,Does not hold up,"I have had this phone for about six months, and although the reception is fine, the buttons don't work well anymore. Sometimes when I press a number, nothing happens. Sometimes pressing once makes it dial twice. I hope they let me return it."
5,"Reader, get to work!","James Buchan is a master at depicting the fractured nature of life and consciousness. Bits and pieces are brought together but never seem to illustrate a complete picture. This book is ostensibly about some back channel negotiations surrounding an Arms control conference. Buchan uses this story to examine one man's mind (an intelligence operative) as he tries to get his mind around European history, his personal history, and his heart. The reason I titled this essay ""Get to work"" is because the reader must pay attention. A great writer is showing you something so don't take your eyes off the text. Not just a story but a taste from the river that is history and one man's consciousness. A book for grown ups. Thank you."
5,The Truth About Spiritual Warfare,"This book was absolutely refreshing. To see an author write with simplicity and clarity was a joy. Dr. Bingle's ability to relate in understandable terms the pitfalls that many people face on a daily basis provided great insight into my personal shortcomings. Often times I heard Christians blaming the devil for their problems and in reality, they should have been looking into the mirror for their problem.This book brings a spiritual reality to the arena of personal responsibility. Each person must be responsible for their actions and quit looking for an easy excuse for improper behaviors.Thank you Dr. Bingle for your tremendous insights. My prayer would be that many would read this book and grow from the truths that are revealed."
3,Not as good as the previous Myth Adventures,"This book was good, but it hold par with the previous six. While there is more character development on Chumley, Massha, Guido, and Gleep, I liked Skeeve's narration better."
3,The link is broken,This was supposed to be the link in the series...where we would get I assume books dealing with individual characters...the link if you will between the new series and the next books..unfortunately the series is just falling apart..the snap is gone and the writing is no longer fun...it has become tedious and skeeve has lost his magic...AAHz is now just a loud mouth and does nothing to advance the series any further ...needs help ...save it please
4,"Wonderful stories - not so great ""print""","These stories have quickly become a bed-time necessity in our house for my 4 year old who now requests them by character. The only draw back is the excessive number of typos in the copy - reddy fox becomes reddy fix, etc. Once you've read them as much as I have, they are quickly overlooked, but the warning is nice to have!"
5,Wonderful children's stories,"Thornton Burgess is one of my family's favorite children's authors. We much prefer Mother West Wind's stories to Brer Rabbit and Uncle Remus. Burggess' style of writing is soothing and lulling, wonderful for bedtime or to calm an agitated or over-stimulated child. I read all of these over and over to my five kids who found them fascinating glimpses into the lives of animals. I would find myself sinking into a slow drawl, with just a touch of twang,as we followed the doings of Bobby Coon, Grandfather Frog and and the Merry Little Breezes.Especially delightful for city children who haven't much exposure to rural life."
4,A Good Read,"I picked this up at random, but found it very enjoyable. The story is a more or less predictable story of crooked public officials, crooked police officers, mob members, and one straight cop trying to cleanup the whole city on his own, but the writing it good and keeps you wanting more. It was difficult to put the book down, and during the day I was wanting to get back to it. After finishing it, I looked the author up to find his next book but he has not written many. Too bad."
1,poor track selection. Bad and old songs. Cheap selection. DO NOT BUY!,"Very old music, bad songs, bad sound quality. The worst experience you could imagine. DO NOT BUY!"
5,Excellent bilingual book,"I know a handful of Spanish vocabulary and wanted to expose my infant son to the sounds and cadence of the language. This is a fun book although if you're a Spanish novice, some of the word tenses are a little tough to sound out. It is paperback though - I was hoping for a board book so he could turn the pages while we read. He loves it anyway."
1,Not what I expected-,"I purchased this book because it is written in Spanish with English subtitles and I thought it would be a fun way to teach Spanish to my two year old son. But the book lacks imagination and excitement. It is almost weird to read. I've been reading to my little boy since he was a newborn and needless to say, he loves being read to. He knows what he likes and will pick out the book he wants me to read to him. He was intrigued by the book cover and asked me to read it to him. Not one minute into the reading, he was already picking out another book! I thought it could be the age factor so I read it to my friend's 6 year old- the result was the same! If you're looking for a good book that will capture your little one's attention and will contribute to his/her bilingual needs, this is NOT the book- However, this is my opinion, and it is not necessarily what you may experience if you were to read it to your child.I hope my review is helpful =o)"
3,Cute,This is a cute book but the colors aren't that bold and so the baby gets bored. Kind of old-looking book...
3,Kids like this,"This is a cute book, and my kids look like they enjoy it.I'm trying to teach them Spanish and I bought this to add to my Spanish library.This book is not too bad, but it's not super great, either. It's just okay.There isn't much to the book. I guess maybe I was expecting a little more reading."
2,Disappointed,"The product is not great for the way they stated...poor leather standard...Holeman's NIV is really thin, clean looking and crisp...for the same price"
1,disapointed,"the book contained almost no items to build like swing sets, slides monkey bars climbing stuff, great if you want a playhouse, but lacked variety. $16 wasted in my opinion don't recomend buying this book.It only had about 20 items to build. omly one swing set.major disapointment."
2,Dead on Target missed by a mile,"Dead on Target was the cruelest piece of the Hardy boy books that I've ever seen. You kill of not only the love of joe's life, but also the sister of his best friend. And then the reader is given the false hope that Iola could still be alive by giving these assasin phonies. In my opinion, Iola MOrton should make a surprise come back and stay. Why did she have to die anyway? If it was to free Joe from a relationship, a simple break-up would have done the job. And now Joe has a steady girlfriend anyway. Some great story lines could come out of her return. I've thought the story through many times. Even in the Lazurus Plot, Joe vows that he'll never stop searching. Well, What happened!The one good point I will say is that it made me keep reading."
1,Something is wrong,"This book is included in your section ""books in spanish"" that I understood books writen in spanish not in english. The copy you recently sent me is in english and it is a really problem for me because is a gift for my wife ( fan of this singer ) who doesn't read english."
3,Religious Life Explained,"Author, Ranft gives a concise history of religious women from the 4th century through the 17th century. There is much evidence of the central role played by these women in the formation of the religious life in Europe and the premodern Europe.Many forms of religious life are explained: ascetics,virgins,deaconesses, anchorites,ammas,beguines,oblates, beatae, nuns, canonesses, tertiaries and sisters.The material is organized chronologically....with Chapter 1: The Beginning and Ending with Chapter 8: The Transition into the Modern Age.Roles of different communities are highlighted such as The Grey Sisters, Ursulines, Visitandines, Poor Clares, Daughters of Charity,and Carmelites. The foundresses of many communities are included.Interesting information regarding tertiaries (lay members of a religious third order)who became saints. To clarify the 1st order was the clergy 2nd order were women religious and third order were the lay members.A very good reference book."
5,A valuable resource,"Ranft takes on a large time period in her discussion of religious women and their lives. Like her other books, this one is a must read."
5,J.C. Beker's Brilliance,"Not to put too fine a point on it, but the previous reviewer doesn't know what he is talking about. J.C. Beker was widely regarded as a great Pauline Scholar. A consensus among non-fundamentalist scholars, i.e. real scholars, is that many of the epistles written in Paul's name were written by others. One prominent example: how could the same writer who speaks of there being ""neither male nor female"" in Christ also write to ""Timothy"" that women in church should just hush up?"
5,Very good kit for frequent or long drive users.,Its a very good product for long drive users. The price is ok. Charging the ipod using the Griffin power adapter was taking only less time when Compare to charge the ipod using computer's USB port.
4,Works great but turn up the volume,"It creates an audible white noise, but if you turn up the Ipod volume its easy to ignore. One of the few chargers with a surge protector, which prevents a lot of those battery explosion mishaps."
4,COuld be better,Works good but usb is hard to remove from powerjack and led is really dim and hard to see alot of the time.
3,"Not Bad, for the money.","This worked really well and I love the conveniance of the car plug, however the charging cord that came with mine did not work. Otherwise everything else was great."
5,Fascinating book,"I bought this book because I was fascinated by the Kurokawa wing at the Van Gogh museum as a piece of architecture, it being a mix of granite, titanium and water. This book is a fascinating insight into both buildings at the museum, how they came about and why they look the way they do (it's all related to Van Gogh). There is also some fantastic photography in the book. A real winner I think!"
4,Much Easier than a top rack,"Not quite as much room as I anticipated, but it's still much easier than lugging suitcases over your head to put on the overhead rack."
3,"great idea, but not the best","I would not buy this again, instead I would buy big plastic tubs for storage and strap them down. They are more water proof and the size could very, plus they could be used for something else too."
3,Good starter book for ice cream making,"I've had this book on my shelf for years and only recently have had a chance to use it--finally got an ice cream maker! It's a great starter book--the recipes are simple, straightforward, and plentiful. It runs the gamut from your more ""pedestrian"" flavors (like vanilla, chocolate, etc.) to things like sweet potato and ginger.The recipes overall seem to be lighter than other ice cream recipes out there--relying on more milk (as opposed to cream) and fewer eggs. The results still have been creamy and delicious, despite being (somewhat) healthier.The coffee ice cream recipe, by the way, is exceptional!I do wish there was more information on the hows and whys of ice cream making, but overall, it satisfies (especially for a book collecting dust unused for years!)."
3,Most of the recipes use eggs,"This cookbook has some great ice creams and sorbets, but I was disappointed that the ice cream recipes always contain eggs. I know that makes it richer, but I wish that some eggless ice creams were included as well."
2,A lot of nice recipes but,there were many that I don't think the average family would make.Wanted something more basic to serve to the grandchildren.
1,The Ultimate Additive Ice Cream Book,"It's a good thing I did not pay for this book or I would have returned it. Ice Cream should be made using only fresh ingredients and only those that are necessary to make good ice cream. The addition of flour to the recipe seems unnecessary to me. I have made several batches of ice cream without adding flour and they are very good, especially the mint chocolate chip.This book is very disappointing! If I wanted unnecessary ingredients in my ice cream, I would continue to purchase my ice cream from the store."
1,Must cook before making ice cream,"I read the reviews and many people complained about the recipes having eggs in them. I thought that I could just omit the eggs and still have good ice cream. Well, I have owned the book for over a year and have yet to make a single batch of ice cream. All ice cream recipes must be cooked in advanced and then cooled. Probably 95% of them have eggs in them. While the recipes may be delicious (I don't know), it is far too much effort for me. I exclusively use the manual that I got with my ice cream maker and have played around with that instead. The author has some great ideas for unique types of ice cream and the sugar cone recipes are interesting as well, but I'll probably just donate this unused book to the library."
5,Great gift - for a friend or yourself!,"I saw this book on a friend's wishlist and got it for them for Christmas. I flipped through it when I got it and decided I had to get one for myself! Has tons of recipes in it, even some really off-the-wall types I probably will never try. The ""normal"" flavors are all excellent and I plan on trying a few of the slightly different ones. ;) If someone you know is getting an ice cream maker, this makes a great gift (especially if you put this with the Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream cookbook)."
5,My Bible,"I have been using this book down in Australia for YEARS. I have my favourite recipes from it, that i make time-and-time again: Pistachio, hazelnut and the lemon sorbet are almost always sitting up in my freezer! A great resource for lovers of homemade ice cream...."
4,Great product,"This book is very helpful in making any kind of ice cream that I want and more ideas for different ice cream/Sorbets, etc. I couldn't believe that there are so many choices. Thanks for a great recipe book that I can use for my new KitchenAid Ice Cream Maker."
1,horrible recipe that wasted my time and effort,"After buying a Mussso Lussino ice-cream maker, I bought several ice-cream recipe books, and have made wonderful home made ice-creams, but tonight it's the first time I used this book to make the pineapple ice-cream and it turns out awful! I followed the instructions carefully and I've made ice-cream using the same machine but different recipe book with no problem but this recipe is just awful, the ice-cream tasted like bad quality butter, it was salty and the texture has a plastic chew to it... I actually bought both this book and the ultimate dessert book, really regretting it now, I will never trust these recipes again. It was a waste of time and effort and I had to throw away the whole batch because it tasted so bad I just can't eat it. would much recommend ""The Perfect Scoop"" if you want good recipes!"
4,good versatile book,"There are a lot of different recipes in this book, some that use egg, some that don't, some fantastic milk-free (chocolate sorbet), and tons of different flavors.This is a great book to start with, though I recommend also scouring the internet for additional recipes if there's something specific you want to try"
5,A Very Cool Book,"I bought an ice cream maker at Williams-Sonoma this summer and the store clerk suggested I buy this book to go with it. I wanted to get the most out of my machine so I bought it, and I've been cooking my way from one end to the other ever since. I've never seen so many classic ice cream recipes along with so many unusual ones. And they all work. The chocolate truffle ice cream is dark and rich. The green tea ice cre am is light and subtle. And the oatmeal ice cream is my favorite new breakfast. If you want an ice cream cook book that has it all, you just found it. Buy this book today."
3,Disappointing,"After being promised over 500 recipes I had expected a book that really covered the field for all kinds of ice cream and frozen desserts. Not so. The book does indeed give quite a few recipes, but unfortunately they are fairly repetitious. Each recipe is followed by a fairly obvious list of additions you might make, which accounts for all those 500. Add some chopped nuts? Voila! It counts as a new recipe. There is no mention in the book of using Italian meringue as an addition, which greatly lightens ice creams, and no mention of using condensed or evaporated milk as a base for ice cream. The failure to describe using whipped cream or egg white in making sherbets is a serious omission. If you will read carefully through THE JOY OF COOKING and some of the other standard general cookbooks you will get basic ideas for making good ice cream and sherbet that are completely missing here. Too bad."
3,The Ultimate Frozen Custard Book,"This book was not what I expected. All of the ice cream recipes are actually for frozen custards (contains eggs and require cooking mixture on stove top before freezing). There are some interesting recipes, especially for sorbets."
2,I never make icecream owning only this book,"When my husband bought me an ice cream maker, he also purchased this book, I assume thinking that it would be an all-inclusive recipe book. It does have some recipes that sound good, but...I never make ice cream because all the recipes require that the mix be made the day before and refridgerated overnite. I don't have time to think ahead like that!!!! And by then my craving for ice cream is gone anyway!A friend's copy of Ben and Jerry's book made me realize that not everything has to be refridgerated forever first - and I'm buying that today - now maybe the icecream maker should go back in the freezer!"
3,Ice Cream Too Rich,"The recipes in this book are easy to follow and very creative, however, they are much too rich for me and my family. He uses heavy cream and eggs in most of his recipes, which is just too rich. After all, who wants Red Bean, Pine Nut, Cucumber, Beet or Tomato ice cream? I would like to have seen more low-fat and low-sugar recipes, and more ""Philadelphia Style"" recipes (without cooking and eggs). But if you like custard-style ice cream (super-rich and cooked with eggs), this is the book for you."
2,The Master Handbook of Telephones,This book was not what I expected. I assumed that it was a technical work that would help me rebuild some antique telephones. It seems to be aimed at people who do not have telephones and want to know what they look like. This book might be helpful to an English speaking aboriginal society. I can only add that it is well written even though it is shallow.
4,Good reference book,"I got this book years ago in an earlier edition in Physical therapy school. I found it very helpful since it is full of ideas for treatment and exercises for some different diagnoses. Of course, I used it a lot in school in a few courses, it was invaluable in the clinic when I was doing a lot of outpatient orthopaedic patients. Since I am now doing inpatient acute patients I have rarely used this book, but I still have it as a reference because you never know when it may be useful to brush up on. I recommend that you get this book if you are in school or think that clinical ortho patients are your niche."
5,This is a good foundation book,This is a good book for beginning students of therapeutic exercise and mobilization techniques. It gives the basic foundation of the treatments and the sound reasoning behind it. It is a good book to have for P.T. and A.T.C. students just starting out in their career and a good reference book once out in the working field.
5,An extensive trivia resource for trivia-based party games and contests,"One Up Trivia by Ken Weber (Professor Emeritus, University of Toronto) is an impressive compendium organized into sections focused on classic movies, geography, headlines, sports, the natural world, weirdness, history, the arts, legends, industry and inventions. One Up Trivia provides answers to a wealth of fun and informative questions such as: When did the US government start issuing stamps?; What does ""paparazzi"" mean in Italian?; and What country is the world's largest producer of diamonds? to What country has the largest number of sheep?; What's missing on the Mona Lis face?; and What is the second most common surname in the US? One Up Trivia is very highly recommended as an extensive trivia resource for trivia-based party games and contests."
2,Love the Giants! Hate this sweater!,I brought this for my boyfriend and we had seen it elsewhere and the quality was fantastic but when I received it in the mail from Foot Locker the material was not that of a sweater but more of a cheap jersey. It looks good from far away but up close.... not so good.
5,I love this!!! So much better than hard plastic,I use it while my daughter is lying down. She loves being in the tub. This just makes her float. It's great as the get bigger to use like the ring. Would buy for a friend and totally recommend!!
1,TERRIBLE NOT SAFE UNSTABLE FOR INFANT,"I bought this for my son (5mo.) He is just starting to sit on his own and I thought this looked liked a wonderful alternative to the hard plastic bath seats I have used for my other children. IT IS NOT!!! The seat looks great and seems wonderful until you get it in the tub. It does not stay afloat! When my son tried to reach for a toy he went under. I had to use 2 hands to keep him upright. It has nothing in it for buoyancy. It seems to be just ""fluff"" and therefore when you put any weight or pressure on the side of it, it is submerged. I guess in the picture it shows a person holding on to the arm of the infant, that is an understatement! If your baby moves at all, he goes under. Too bad, I think the idea is wonderful, but the product needs serious improvement. I returned it immediately."
1,Great if you want your kid to sink,"I've never written a negative review... if I could give this zero stars I would. First of all, it sinks the instant you put it in the tub... like all the way to the bottom of the tub. The tag says to ring it out if it sinks... hmmm... how do you do that when your kid is in it? Second of all, it weighs about 100 lbs when you take it out of the tub. I swear... this is the worst baby product I've ever owned (and I've owned a LOT)... My 6mo son sits up great on his own, was slipping and sliding around in this, falling backwards, I had to hold him the entire time with both hands... pathetic. Don't waste your money. Tomorrow we will be going out to get the traditional plastic bath seat... good grief."
4,Works great - Non-skid tub,"I have a non-skid tub, so most of the bath seats out there won't work in my tub, so I gave this a shot. It worked great for my 7 month old. He sits up on his own, but will fall over, and sharing the tub with his big brother makes that very likely. So I needed something to stabilize him, but obviously knowing that I'd be watching every second. There was about 6 inches of water in the tub, so even when it sank, it was barely underwater, and I just gave it a quick squeeze and it floated again.Understanding that the purpose is just to help balance my baby, this is just what I needed. Suction cups won't work in my tub because of the non-skid bottom. At the end of the bath, I left it in the tub while I got my baby into bed, and when I came back, a lot of the water had already drained out, so it wasn't heavy at all."
3,Range Kleen Stainless Steel 12 Inch Non-Stick,"This is a good value for a large non-stick pan. The interior coating is excellent, and the exterior is bright-finished stainless. It has plenty of depth and works well in my kitchen.The only caveat is that it is very lightly-built. The handle is securely riveted to the pan, but the material is thin, which leaves it feeling fragile and floppy. The pan works great, but is absolutely not ""commercial chef"" level construction. Suitable for amateurs like me.."
2,Not worth the price,"This item is very lightweight and I expected them to be much heavier for the price. Also, the handles are hollow and for $40, I do not believe they should have been hollow."
4,HP K54000 DTN Printer,"It is far better than the HP932C that it replaced. Faster, better print quality, networkable, two-sided printing works very good. I use an IMac, it was very easy to setup. For the money I am well pleased.Only con is it's size."
3,HP K5400DTN PRINTER,PRINTER WORKS GREAT WHEN PRINTING ON ONE SIDED. WHEN TRYING TO DO DUPLEXING (two sided coping)THE PAPER JAMS UPALL THE TIME. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I SENT THE SELLER AN EMAILTO LET HIM KNOW WHATS GOING ON AND HE NEVER GOT BACK TO ME.
5,Entirely charming,"One of my most played records of the last couple of years. Distinctive vocals, quirky arrangements, but overall as musical and satisfying an album as anyone has put out in recent times. A landmark folk album, that deserves a far wider audience than it got."
4,Superb and mesmerizing album!,Should've opened for her when I had the chance! Does anyone know how much a private run copy of Pirate's Gospel would fetch? The one's she handmade herself? I have a copy that I am willing to part with if the price is right.
4,movement,These earrings really are fabulous! they offer a lot of movement and sparkle without being too big and heavy for my ears - love 'em!
5,Fun reading,I have read all of the Joe Grey Mysteries and I cannot wait for the next. Cats solving crimes is a cute read when I don't want a depressing story line.
3,its rumors,"this game actually needs a group of people to have the most fun part of it, however it is cool game i have tried it coble of times though.."
5,Forgiveness,This DVD was very inspiring and brought a desire to forgive the seemingly unforgivable. To be like Jesus!
3,Interesting short story needlessly expanded into a book,"The Train was on Time is Heinrich Boll's first work, published in 1947, a time when Germans were trying to come to terms with the atrocities they had wrought and the widespread destruction their nation suffered in return. Andreas, a young soldier on his way to the meat grinder that was the Eastern Front, is suddenly gripped by the knowledge (not just the preminition or conviction) he will die in the next few days. We spend many pages in a short work following him through the mental torment and his undying love for a French girl he saw for less than a second during a battle in 1940. Towards the end he and a couple of soldier friends take refuge in a bawdy house in Lvov just hours before Andreas knows he will die. I am sure that at the time this book broke new ground but read now, all these years later, it comes across as little more than a young's man philosophical ramblings about life and war and death. At heart it is a good short story."
2,Boll at his best,"This is an ok read. It's a somewhat feverish account about a german soldier on a train going to the east front in September 1944. The troops on the train are divided in two camps, those who says that of course Hitler will win the war and those who knows that the war is lost. The I persona of the account knows that he is soon going to die. And inside he prays for himeself and others, apparently he is christian. There is also a love story he has with a prositute, which somewhat reminded me about White Nights by Dostojevskij."
3,A short story- - - s t r e t c h e d,"Not a novel with a good story line,character development,visual scenes,humor,etc.Most of the book consists of mental gymnastics over expecting death soon.After a hundred pages of this one is left with wondering if this is ever going anywhere and finally all wraps up in a few pages.So, its a classic and with all its mental gymnastics,can probably provide lots of inconclusive discussion fodder.It reminds me of the stuff we were subjected to in school which turned so many of us off.If you like this sort of stuff,great. If not,don't be too influenced by classics,prize winners,best sellers,etc. There's a whole world of books out there,whatever your taste,go find them and enjoy!"
5,PERFECT SIZE for SOUP or SALAD,"This bowl is the PERFECT SIZE for salad, soup, spaghetti, or cereal with lots of fruit - your meal will NOT spill out over the edge! TIN CAN ALLEY goes rather well with the dinnerware pattern I use daily."
5,Great Gift,"This was a gift for my stepmother. She had picked out these dishes, so I got her a piece. I really liked the style. It inspired me, I might look into updating my dishes."
2,Nice Bag. . . But Too Small,"I got this bag because it says that it was made for the Sony DCR-SR200 Handycam. I guess technically it is, but there is one major flaw. You can't fit the camera in the bag with the battery on the camera. The flap will barely catch on the velcro - not very secure. It would be annoying to have to put the battery on the camera everytime you wanted to use it, or have to carry the camera outside of the bag all the time (which defeats the very purpose of the bag, right?). In addition, you can't fit any cords, extra batteries, etc. in the bag with the camera.Nice quality to the padding inside and the materials throughout - just too small."
3,Not a very good purchase,"Just after I purchased this product, its price decreased, so, this is not a good bargain for me."
3,Must have an Open Mind!!!!,"I love some of these stories. There is something for everyone with any sexual orientation. You need to have an open mind--there are stories of dominace, gay and lesbian sex, and kink of all kinds. You may or may not find this hot, but provides intersting reading, anyway."
4,the best of the best,I thought this best american erotica was the best so far in the series with 1996 being a close second. I sometimes read the stories just because they are good but this time around there were a few times I had to stop reading to go especially enjoy myself if ya know what I mean.
2,"Warning: These are not ""the best""","The reading public should know that these stories are the ""best"" according to the editor's taste -- and the editor doesn't write erotica. There are lots of erotica books out there where the stories are high quality and where the authors didn't get included based on what they could do for the editor's reputation. Don't be fooled by the title. The ""best"" is highly subjective."
5,Diverse Soundscape,"This differs from another ""The L Word"" compilation but is equally inspired and inspiring. I have one word for you: Betty. Betty, Betty, Betty. Who is the cellist for Betty? She is terrific! The cello is a clever yet oft overlooked way to deliver a melodic bassline. I usually hate the aquisition of tags that have nothing to do with the music, e.g. feminist, anarchist, punk. If this album is chick music I'm overtly willing to make an exception. Kudos."
4,Love the variety of Music,"I really enjoy the variety of music on this CD. I've been introduced to new groups and songs by established artists that did not make top 40. Magic Tree, Ride a White Horse, Long Way to Happy, and Living Proof are my favorites. I rediscovered Tori Amos and of course Betty Rocks!"
5,Stormtiger's review,Every track delivery a different vibe. All are some the best smooth jazz I every listen to. I was surprised to find that I haven't heard of the artists that perform these track before. Good stuff. Would like to hear more from them.
1,does not have winxp drivers,This enclosure does not have WinXP drivers. WinXP just says that it is an unrecognized device. The drivers that come with it are only for Win98. I went to their website and the drivers section contains only one exe. I ran it and it says that it is meant only for Win98.I emailed the company last week but have not heard anything back.
3,Camry 2004---Made in Japan or in the USA?,These rear brake pads did not fit my 2004 Camry LXE. The Wagner front disc pads advertised to fit this car did and I was happy with them. I had to return these rear pads and did receive a full refund from Amazon. I ended up buying my rear brake pads at Kragen....where I found out that if your Camry was made in the USA then these rear pads would fit.....if not then there is another set of rear pads for a Japan built car. I found out that my Camry was made in Japan by looking at the brake pads..........so before you buy find out about where your car was manufactured.
1,2002 Camry = it did not fit,"Amazon told me that this brake-pad was supposed to fit in my 2002 Camry. They were wrong. Make sure that your car uses brake pads, no brake drums. My Camry was made in Kentucky, USA. Maybe the Japaneses edition uses brake pads, no idea."
4,Pretty good...,"I just got this, it works pretty good. pretty thorough. I'm only on the 3rd cd, but its ok so far. If you get frustrated on the first cd, thats ok because you aren't really supposed to remember any of those words. After that it becomes easier, even though there are a few areas you feel like skipping. Don't try to listen to it all in one sitting. It might take a while. this is a VERY thorough product."
3,OK but not what I expected,The main reason I ordered this mouthwash was that it is described as alcohol free. I thought that meant that it would not be intense - that it would not sting my mouth. But that turned out not to be true. It has a sharp sting to it. Otherwise it tastes OK and that's pretty much all I can say about it.
3,"Don't expect another ""Nothing Stops Moving""","I really have mixed feelings about writing this review right now because I have only had the disc for a few days. However, I wanted to warn people who thought this may be like the other 2 Gingersol discs, and buy it on that strength alone. Unlike the first two which had a Replacements/early Wilco feel, this one is much more polished and refined. The songs are well crafted, but I don't hear that raw energy on this one. I would encourage you to try and listen to it before you buy it."
4,Family Edition not the Same as Plus Edition,"Chatchecker Lite is FREE online, but it doesn't save the conversations for longer than 1 day. I thought ordering a ""paid"" subscription would get me use of all the features, but after installing I found out that I would still have to pay more $ to have all the features of Chatchecker Plus. Now to get the features I thought I was getting by buying this Family version, I still have to pay more $.All I get for my money is the ability to see the conversations online for more than one day. As far as I can tell, that is the only difference between the free version and this one I paid $29 for."
4,A stunning book about the human spirit,"This book is stunning. It is the tale of a woman who get's raped, and then has to learn to continue living. She and her partner (another woman) travel the land reading hearts. She can only draw what she sees in somebody's heart, and her partner can only interpret the drawings. In order to do this they have to have complete trust in each other, a bond that joins them body, spirit and soul. When this bond is threatened, the entire future of the country's monarchy could be in danger..."
2,No magic in it for me,"I was looking forward to this, from reading the ""back of the book"" stuff, but it didn't take long to become disillusioned. The badguy is *so bad*, almost from page one. He basically does everything except kick puppies for fun. I couldn't take him seriously as a real person. His notion of his own influence is also overlarge; a couple of times later in the book he executes some cunning plan (which isn't very cunning) only to have it fail, and he has no backup.I was disappointed by the heart reading, because it didn't seem to be particularly insightful. I mean, the heart readers weren't telling the people anything they didn't already know. It didn't feel like magic, it felt like pop psychology. Also, the prince who wasn't ""pure of heart"" was described by the heart readers basically as unable to know love, but that really doesn't fit with the novel's end.To me, it just felt like there was some gratuitous violence and no real character development. I'd skip this one."
3,Worst Endless Waltz Model,"This in all honesty, is not a very good deal. This is the only model in the entire line to be molded in one color. Yes, you can build Tallgeese I and II, but that's rather pointless since they are available separately for less- and unless you're colorblind, converting between them will be a huge pain.Another thing to note is most of this kit is taken directly from the original TV series kit, meaning the quality is significantly less than other Endless Waltz ones, especially the joints.The heat rod ""snake"" thing is actually less impressive than the one in the old Epyon kit- because it's only one piece! The beam cannon has almost no poseability and the weak joints preclude really doing much with it.The only bright spot is that the center torso was redone so that it moves similarly to some Master Grade kits (but with a weaker joint), but that's about it.Basically, unless you love the Tallgeese III and really want it in this scale (and are willing to paint it), skip this kit."
3,TEST is correct!,"This was one of the most painful games I have ever played! It really is a shame, because i love the way the play is set up, but the board and the pieces were cheap (the board wouldn't even lay flat) and I had never even heard of half the movies or actors. Admittedly, I'm only 18 years old, but even my parents were lost on most of the questions! It probably took two hours to finish, and that was with inventing our own rules (""Okay.. if you can guess within 5 years of the correct answer you can move 3 spaces!""). There were a few modern movies such as ""Fargo"" and ""Agent Cody Banks"" and some classics like ""Some Like it Hot"" but for the most part, they were pretty obscure."
1,Sorry but this is BAD!!,"I have to agree with everyone else on this game it's really terrible! Which is sad because it's basic playing rules are well thought out. The movies they except you to know are just crazy. Buy ""Scene It"" instead."
1,Pathetic !,This is a complete travesty. MGM have the audacity to believe that their studio makes films so powerful that they stay in the memory.Fair enough assumption you may think. The reality is a horrible hotch-potch of films that no-one has ever watched all the way through and consequently a dull waste of money.It even has the brass neck to ask you to complete lines from films. Fine. Except the chances of knowing are remote in the extreme. If a good barometer of a family game is fun then this scores a fat zero.This is terrible. Shameful cashing in on a name.....
2,Very Disappointing,"After opening the DVD case 1 time, it broke. During the 2nd game, we were already getting repeat questions from the 1st game. Plus most of the movies were obsure old titles that we had NEVER heard of or seen. This game was not very fun at all. I am taking it back and buying Scene It."
1,"Accidental ""power off"" most joyous part of game!","The obscurity of the movies has been well-covered by all the other reviewers and I completely agree. They were mostly forgettable or obscure with a ""cult classic"" thrown in from time to time. Initially, however, the obscurity was my favorite part of this game. I was glad to try to answer questions about ""Robocop"" and ""Tank Girl"" instead of the usual ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Dr. Zhivago,"" but I couldn't. The questions were about forgotten ""famous lines"" and nameless ""starlets."" The instructions seemed like they were translated (poorly) from a dead language. The DVD ""menu"" was time consuming and awkward (and painfully necessary with every turn). The board and pieces were cheep and unimaginative, and the die had only three sides. But that is two sides too many if I were going to review this game with a roll of the die."
1,Do your homework,"Stef Ann should do her homework about her subject matter. A big focus of her book is youth baseball. Little League ends at age 12, yet Stef Ann has boys playing when they are 17. The term ""little"", means the little field. I found this very irritating. All Stef Ann had to do was a google search to get the correct infromation.Gail"
3,"Not a Big Deal to You, But It Matters to Us","In the South we have corrected a flaw in the English language - the lack of a second person plural - with ""you all"" or its contraction, ""y'all.""Y'all is NEVER used to address individuals.It is such a simple thing, that I find it incredible that writers and editors of contemporary novels set in the South or with Southern characters get it wrong.Other things that interfered with my enjoyment of this book: Did anyone - even Idahoans (if that's the word) who identified themselves as Democrats really vote for Bush in 2004? And, the child the mother DOESN'T worry about is the one who is looking for a friend like the one who used to kill worms for fun and who ends the book encouraging tarantulas to kill each other."
4,Emotional Roller-Coaster.... In a good way,"'Lucy Gets Her Life Back' by Stef Ann Holm is not your standard romance novel. Lucy is a divorce mother of two who has just moved to small town in Idaho. Drew is a ex-professional baseball player who has 17 year old daughter that he trying to get to know. This novel has many fun sub-plots. This book would making you cry and laugh. Spend a little time in Red Duck, Idaho."
5,Kathi is a brilliant executive coach and hiring guru and shares her insights in this book,"Kathi explains in this book how to shape, inspire and coach tough but talented employees to achieve and be part of a cohesive team. She runs a business consulting to the Fortune 500 on hiring, training and evaluating high potential employees. Her XC Insight system delivers 360 degree results and has turned hiring high-potential employees into more of a science than an art.Her coaching business, XB Coaching, helps senior executives get better performance from their workforce.She shares her insights in this terrific book."
5,Unforgettable children's stories.,This is the greatest children's book series ever written.Juniper is my favorite!
3,a decent start,"having just completed the Alta Via 2, I must say that the section dealing with this route needs to be seriously updated in the book. 'ferrate' listed have been replaced with bridges, hut phone numbers listed are incorrect (some just have numbers transposed, others have a leading 8 missing).The times listed for individual legs can be accomplished only with a very light pack and at a good clip, if actually trekking, be sure to add 20% to the given times when planning overnights. You do want to enjoy the views, don't you? Also add in time for taking pictures, lunch, and rest stops (the authors suggests this in the introduction)."
3,Great Series,"Excellent, except I got the impression that Montgomery would have won the war by himself. This expisode is very pro pro pro British!!! The British won the war with Americans holding them back!!! If we would have listened to The Field Marshall we would of won 6 months before. The Slowness of the British in the Falaise pocket delay after Normandy was not mentioned and the Market Garden was Eisenhower's fault (not giving Montgomery troops promised and not agreeing to the operation sooner). The producers made a point that Eisenhower bet ""Monty"" that the war would be over by Christmas but Monty won but failed to mention it was according to Monty's plan. Also what do you expect the actors to do, look like the real guys. For what it is worth they did ok, what do you expect. All in all the episode was Good but I still recommend the World at War series, it is also pro British but does give respect to the American leadership during that time."
2,D-Day to Berlin BBC Video,"I got this DVD a few years back but finally watched it tonight. Disappointed! This seemed to be like a propaganda piece on how Montgomery saved the Allied Powers andhow all the battles were his ideas. ""Assault on Fortress Europe D-DAY"" part of theWar File series is far superior. 'D-Day to Berlin' does not even mention that theAmericans provided 3/4 of all men and war material. Again why all the re-enactments; there is plenty of new and old found Colour and B&W; film footage.Where is the mentioning that Montgomery was to take Caen within a week. Then we had'Totalize; Epson and Goodwood with massive tank loses. (Oh, ya the Americans fault)Americans came-up with COBRA. Eisenhower went along with ARNHEM. The list goes onand on. I do like the other documentaries but this is the weakest."

Shorter cables are fantastic!Would recommend the shorter cables to everyone in the market for great quality speaker cables. Long length cables had serious problem. Perhaps a manufacturing defect?"
2,"I know it's mini, but...","I bought this toy for my toddler who loves Spiderman. When I bought the product, the dimensions of the toy were not given (the weight was, but how helpful is that in judging size?). I ended up buying the toy for $9.95 plus $4.95 shipping, and was shocked when it arrived. It's smaller than an action figure (slightly larger than a Little People figure). It was definitely NOT worth the price!"
2,Competent film version of the Pulitzer Prize winning novella,"This is the second of three film versions of the Pulitzer Prize winning novella (134 pages do not a novel make!). The third version is in post-production as we write. Neither of the first two were anything beyond potboiler status, and took liberties with the narrative. I am writing here to correct the negative review on this page from a person in Medford, Oregon. He or she is entitled to his or her opinion, but is not entitled to erroneous information. The 1929 film was nominated for only one Oscar (Art Direction) and won. There was no second nomination involved, let alone a second win."
3,Wasted potential,"Being a Spike fan, I was excited to see a book that would have him in a prominent role. In this, I wasn't disappointed. However, I can say that the story of Spike's past was the main reason I kept reading the book.The beginning starts off slowly, and includes some unnecessary information--often repeated throughout the book--that doesn't add to the meaning or plot of the story. Willow's section is the most tedious, partly due to the difficulty in making her a vibrant character on paper. In contrast, the characterizations in the Spike section were very well done, and the sub-plot was engaging.The idea behind the story was a good one. If the ending had been less confusing and muddled, and had tied the two plotlines together with much more of a dramatic punch, then it would have been an excellent Buffy novel. As such, it's only worth reading if you want to know more about who Spike was before, and immediately after, being turned into a vampire."
2,Misleading Novel,"How could anyone be bored by a Buffyverse novel? Raised hand here. I had to force myself to read it after the novel didn't deliver in the first, second chapter. Willow and Spike share the cover of ""These Our Actors"" and I assume that the authors thought they were being clever by switching from current Sunnydale (2000) to Spike early vampire days in 1880. We learn nothing new about Willow other than she finds Spike attractive. The characterization of Buffy is insulting. The authors write her as a dumb jock who couldn't lead a flock of sheep towards the gate let alone bring the Scooby gang together to fight the Big Bad. Spike was much more interesting. Angelus helps Spike through his early vampire days and he had genuine like for old Spike. The ending was disappointing and the plot line was uninteresting and confusing. Yech."
4,A Clarification,"I am not writing to rate this book for reasons that will be obvious in a moment. However, as the rating block is required I will use the present average so as not to skew the numbers. Dori Koogler is my wife.I AM writing to clear up a misapprehension expressed by Lawrence Bernabo in his otherwise excellent review.He correctly assumed that the writing team of McConnell and Koogler split the story lines. However, his guess of who wrote what is reversed. Anyone who is on one of the on-line Buffy lists already knows Dori's fascination with Spike."
3,very confusing and weird book,"i usually love all the buffy the vampire slayer books that come out but this was an exception. willow decides to take her dramaclass even though buffy cannot because it interferes with hernew and improved slayer schedule. willow then volunteers at thetheater where soon after, things start to go wrong. at first theyseem like harmless pranks until she starts to hear the voices. this leads her into an investigatation of the theater, some of the ancient plays and their connections to the gods. as a by linethey also give us a good description of spike's early life beforehe became a vampire. this was the only decent part of the book.the ending confused me more and left me wondering what the writerwas thinking. i say please go and read any other buffy book butthis one. i wish someone had warned me."
4,present and past,this book goes back and forth from present Sunnydale to England 1880 where William changes his name to Spike. it also tells us about what happened after he left his grave and how (in grapic detail) he finished off his victims.
3,This a GREAT BOOK!!,"This is mostly about Willow, who is in love with witchcraft. Willow and Buffy don't have a lot in common, and when Buffy drops drama. Willow kinda gets upset. Spike who is an evil vampire, was in to this magick witch stuff, before being a vampire. Spike starts to notice how good Willow is with her witchcraft. Willow life is indanger when ghost start to appear. So Willow has to figure out a way to leave drama, before it takes here life."
1,Don't buy this phone and think hard about buying a GE phone,"I purchased this phone in November, it stopped working in January. I packaged up the phone and shipped it back for repair according to the instructions at my own expense. It was returned to me as undeliverable at that address. It is the cheapest two line phone now I know why, bad product and worse service."
4,"good monitor, over-priced","After my first monitor was ordered I did have a problem with the screen being damaged. My second monitor arrived without any problems. As I have read in other reviews the speakers are not exceptional but they do their job well. I think this a perfect size for any college student needing a flat screen monitor, they save a lot of desk top space. I have always been happy with the images on ViewSonic monitors. The colors are brilliant and the refresh rate is quite good. I would recommend this to someone who does any type of data and for any gamer looking for a good starter screen. Bottom line, I wish that it was not so expensive but it has been worth every penny."
5,overall excellent monitor,"I have no complaints about this monitor. It looks and works great, in fact I bought two. One is pluged into the analog the other digital, there's a slit difference, the digital is a little sharper. I'm not a gamer so I can't say if it would satisfy those needs but I suspect with the 8ms response time and the right graphics card it would. I use them for editing film, animating and photo repair and love them for that. Both arrived in perfect working order, no dead pixels. At the moment I even have to rely on the speakers and they work fairly decently as long as you don't turn them up to load, but I will replace my 5.1's soon."
4,Flat panel monitor,"I can't speak to connecting it or even what was in the box, it was a surprise and when I got home it was already set up and connected. But so far I love it, the clarity, sharpness of color is great. I have great speakers already so I have not tested them, for the money, I would say excellent buy. I have no complaints--it's only been a couple of weeks, so I am keeping my fingers crossed."
3,WARNING!! No DVI!!,This review is just to warn potential purchasers that this monitor has no DVI input. It is VGA only! Don't let the misleading Amazon description fake you out. See the Viewsonic website for confirmation.
4,Great value,"Well worth the money. Not the high end clamps that you pay 2 or 3 times as much for, but you aren't paying 2 or 3 times as much. Heavy bars and plenty of clamping force. i just used them to hold a board down to a table saw top while I cross cut it by hand and the board didn't move a bit. A good investment for any weekend woodworker or DIY'er."
2,"Not as good as the 3"" Throat Clamps (Very Cheap Looking !!!)","I had purchased the 48"" x 3"" clamps just before I bought these for only $8 more than these. I thought I would be getting clamps that were close to the same quality, but that couldn't be further from the truth. The Denali 48"" clamps are great, but these are very cheap and small. They look like some old clamps I purchased from Harbor freight before I knew any better. They are very small and the bar is thin. They don't look like they will hold up when a reasonable amount of clamping pressure is applied. I would recommend everyone purchase the 48"" clamps and cut them if you want them shorter. That wouldn't cost much more and you will get a significantly better clamp."
1,"Wrong Cardio Party, Don't buy!!!","Okay, I order this product and got Turbo Jam cardio party mix 1 and I wanted Cardio mix 3. Very upset about this happening. After several e-mails, I was told they do not have the Turbo Jam Cardio Mix 3 in stock anymore, which is a lie they never had it in the first place. Buyers beware!!! They are sending the wrong tape and maybe hoping someone won't return it. Not sure, but I am upset that I just now found this review place as I had only been looking at the sellers performance. I am really upset because I was looking forward to adding this one to my collection."
1,upset,This buyer send me the wrong one. It did not match the picture.Beware make sure u know what your getting . I got a refund but really wanted the item.
5,A Brief History of Chess through its best players,"This is the first book on chess which I have read and it has spurred me to become an avid chess player. The lives of every famous chess player from Philidor to Kasparov is chronicled in this scholarly writing. Complete with their games and excellent photos , this book is a must-read for all who want to know about the greatest players in the history of chess. Brillant and painstaking research on their lives and their eccentricies."
4,Great Stylus,This product met my expectations. The price was great and I haven't had any problems. Great product for the money.
1,This book is sorry.,"Unfortunately I have this book and I have found multiple errors in it even on the spine of the book the one of the unit patches is upsidedown. I would advise against buying this book, it is about a fifth grader's speed."
3,Lovely but not for me....,I have rather strong calves and it makes it hard for boots to fit. This boots are lovely but they didnt mention how wide the opening was. Well i can tell you it doesnt fit around my calves. Even when i went a size larger.I had to return them I wish they listed the width of the opening.
1,attitude without substance,"If you like books that feed dissallusionment then this book is for you. If you want to read a book that will give your hopelessness a legalistic edge it is a must. I am sorry to say that as much as I enjoyed some of Edwards other books example ""A tale of Three Kings"", this one was a huge dissapointment. It is written with an ""elitist"" edge that I find disturbing. Thank God that the Holy Spirit can use anyone or any method He desires! Mike Brown's ""Revolution in the Church"", and Wolfgang Simpsons, ""Houses that change the World"" are 20 times better."
2,Valid But Excessive,"Having been interested in ""house churches"" for some time, I purchased the book: ""How to Meet in Homes.""My recommendation: If you want a Gene Edwards book that will edify, either buy: ""A Tale of Three Kings"" or ""The Prisoner in the Third Cell.""While both of these books are helpful and edifying, there is very little helpful or edifying about: ""How to Meet in Homes.""Basically, Mr. Edwards never answers the question, only reiterating over and over again, the evils of the modern church service.May I therefore remind everyone reading my review: The very fact that Mr. Edwards would criticize the way a church meets is an example of hypocrisy.If the church is to choose for itself how to gather and fellowship (as Mr. Edwards so readily declares), you then cannot deem any particular form or fashion as being wrong.This is very sad."
3,Wake me when it's over...,"There are two Kirks. The Kirk from the original series, and the Kirk from ""ST III:The Search for a Script"" and beyond. The Kirk in this novel is the latter. As such, he is superior to all others in the novel and represented as the guy who knows the truth and Starfleet is in his way. Part of this Kirk is having no depth. He is a cardboard hero who solves all the problems with little difficulty.What is more annoying is the premise, from Spock's ideas to StarFleets. I'll not give anything away, I'll just say I had a few roll my eyes moments.Now, if you can get past the innane plot, and the shallow characters, you definitely have an ok read that is really the prologue to the next book."
5,Great stuff,"Easy to use! So much cheaper than going somewhere to get waxed. If you are on the fence, purchase!! It's worth it for sure!"
4,"A good ""Ouch""!","I'm new to sugaring and waxing altogether, so this was an experiment. I have really delicate skin and followed tips I read online about taking a pain reliever an hour before sugaring, using baby powder to create a barrier between the skin and sugar so it doesn't hurt the skin, and then following up the sugaring with an aloe-based gel or lotion. Those tips saved me a lot of pain! Be careful not to get the sugar too hot or it will be really uncomfortable and may even burn. I love that the linen strips are reusable, and compared to salon prices, the refill jars are very affordable. Keeping a wet cloth nearby will help the process go more smoothly since sticky fingers make it difficult. The thing I love most about Moom is that it is all-natural so I'm not applying any harmful chemicals to my skin. No irritation or chemical burns from the sugar, even in the most sensitive areas. Happy sugaring!"
1,Useless!,"Moom Hair Removal Kit with Tea Tree did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Do not waste your money or your time on this product. I carefully read the directions and exactly followed them, and tried again on 3 separate occasions. I don't think it even removed one hair. I can't imagine how there are any reviewers who this actually works for. This product did smell good and was not at all irritating to my skin, but it does nothing for its intended purpose. Shave, wax or save up your money for laser treatments, but don't spend it here!"
5,A great and easy to use product for a first timer.,"I searched for a long time to find a sugaring product I can use. For a first timer, this product is simply effective and easy to use. Thanks Moon for including all the tools I need in the kit and for effective use at room temperature."
2,Maybe it doesn't work on fine hair,"I've now had this product for six months, and used it about six times on my eyebrows. Each time there are a good amount of hairs left over that I have to pluck. I follow the instructions to a 't', and have tried every which way to get it to work (leaving the strip on longer, using more, using less, re-doing it, rubbing the strip harder, softer, etc.,) and it DOES get rid of some hair, but definitely not all of them. The results also don't last long - two weeks max and they're all grown back. Maybe it's b/c I have fine hair, but I'm hugely disappointed. It's also kinda messy to apply ('strings' everywhere), but cleanup is easy enough."
1,moom products,"With much saddness I must say that this product did not work. Unfortunatley I contactedAmazon a day past the return allowance. I would not purchase this or tell a friend about this product, I would let them know that like most ""as seen on tv "" products they are not worth the money:("
2,I dont like it,"but it's probably because I'm not using it right or something. I tried on my facial hair and the honey is messy. DO NOT HEAT this in the microwave over 10 seconds. I tried it for 15 minutes and the honey was so hot that I nearly burned myself.When I used it on my face, it took some of the fine hair off but not the really corsed ones.I'll try it again later and get back to you."
2,grabs about 60%-70% of hair,"I understand why some ladies can love this, its WAY cleaner, and less irritating, then regular waxing, plus you can wash the muslin strips afterward instead of throwing them away. Honestly it doesnt work the way I want it to, there is pain of course, and the pain does not condone the results... which is not satisfactory to me. I feel as though the only parts Ill be able to use this is on my upper thigh (except where theres spider veins, they say it on there for a reason, definetly didnt follow direction spider veins more prominent now) my arms... and areas like belly button, toes, upper lip where hair is fine, WILL NOT be working with lower leg area (just cuts hair, instead of pulls) and definetly does not work at all for underarm. I am of hispanic decent, and will continue using Parissa Warm Wax instead, Im going to try Zip wax though, Parissa is messy and does irritate, but it gets the job done, just do it before bed time."
3,so so,"I bought this mainly for my legs and facial hair. I do love that it is so easy to use and clean up. I can get it everywhere and know that I can quickly clean it up with water. However, it doesn't wax out all my hair. It always leaves behind hair which kind of defeats my whole purpose of using it at the beginning, I guess my hair is a bit too thick for it?"
4,Sugary Treat,"This stuff is AWESOME!!! Sticky, messy, but nonetheless awesome! Clean up is not too bad, either, since this is a water-based product. I ordered this kit and since then have also ordered more removal strips and several of the the 12 oz size hair remover. Instead of using the popsicle stick applicators, I use a small cake decorating spatula, which nicely spreads the thin layer needed and helps the product go farther.A word of caution - this product is made of sugar. My puppy went crazy trying to lick the remnants off my leg. Not sure if any of the product would hurt him, but I don't want to find out!"
1,what a mess to use,"I purchased this product with high hopes. I had tried this same type of product for unwanted facial hair before without success, but decided to give this one a try. Sadly, it does not remove the unwanted hair as advertised. It would remove the very fine hair but even with repeated uses, still did not remove the stubborn coarse hair which is always the most annoying to deal with. It is messy to work with, hard to apply, even when heated, does not spread smoothly and an all around a dud! Don't waste your hard earned cash!"
3,Just OK,"This wax is just OK. All the hairs doesnt come up in one take, i need to try 2-3 times to come up completely! But it does make my skin smooth after waxing. Its not worth. Also, it works for hands and legs. It failed on face(upperlip) and underarm even after trying 3-4 times! I dont have this problem if i use other wax products!"
4,product is good,"This product is good to use. And after use I just soak in hot water for a few minutes, rinse and dry! For beginners, it takes two or three times to practice how to use it. But! I have a question about the clothes for remove the wax. Where can I buy it?"
2,Underwhelming,"Product was sticky and fairly messy, It didn't apply smoothly because I don't believe it was warm enough even though I followed the directions precisely. It ultimately removed about half the hairs, at best. Even upon repeated application I could not get all of the hairs as I normally would with regular wax. Pretty disappointed with the product...won't be repurchasing Moom again."
2,doesnt really remove hair,"i read plenty reviews , and with confidence finally purchased.i couldnt get it to pull up any hair ... soi let a licensed cosmetologist do it, thinking i was probably doing it wrong.. and even she couldnt get it to pull up hair.waste of my money."
1,Didn't really do anything,I followed all the instructions and it just didn't really do anything. I pulled the strip off and almost no hair was removed.
1,Problem with large fabric strips,"Moom is a great product, have used it for years and love it. My issue is with the large fabric strips in the kit I received from Vitacost. Normally the fabric for the large and small strips is of a lightweight muslin; however, in the kit I received, the large strips are of a heavier weight muslin. When I used them, I had considerable bruising which I've never had with the lightweight strips. I spoke with the Moom company directly and they said that they still use the same fabric for both the large and small strips. To verify this, they also suggested I check out some of their kits at a local retail store. I did and found that to be true. Vitacost claims they don't know how this could be. Unfortunately, I didn't discover this problem while it was still within the guarantee time frame so I have no recourse."
5,Wow awsome for thick dark hair!,"Best wax iv every had even better then the 45 dollar ones I get at the salon. At least for me it was less pain as long as i kept it at a nice ""honey"" consistency. Although I wish I would have ordered more then just 6 oz and more strips just not enough for my hairy legs. For me waxing lasts about 2 weeks tops so if this makes it longer then even a week and a half its worth the money already."
5,Best Way to Remove Unwanted Hair,"I have tried shaving, depilators, epilators and waxing. With shaving and depilators the hair would grown back darker and faster. Using an epilator took too much time. I've tried waxing a salon painful and can get expensive. Waxing strip don'r work at all. I've tried at home hard waxing kits, it painful, messy and not worth trying again. I read a lot of reviews on Moom before trying it. It wasn't painful on my legs at all. It was painful for my underarm since the hair was much thicker. I also tried my bikini line not as painful as imagine since last time I did with traditional waxing and I cried. The hair does take longer to grow but I would not say up to 8 weeks. Th hair does grow back in light. I would absolutely recommend this, if you're new to waxing it might hurt but it will hurt a hell of a lot less than with any other. The only negative I have is that it wasn't enough. So, I learned how to make it thanks to youtube and haven't bought a new pack since."
3,Painful,"I used this product to remove chest and back hair from my wooly boyfriend. (His request FYI) He had a lot of hair, now he only has some hair. The Moom worked on about 90% of it. We followed the directions by trimming hair to 1/2 inch, he exfoliated and cleaned his skin, I heated the wax for 10 seconds in the microwave and we went to it. I applied one strip at a time, and it took about 3 hours to do his chest and back. I had to stop 3 times and wash and dry the strips. The product adhered to the hair well, he said it was painful when I spread it on because it pulled at the hair, then each time I pulled off a strip he yelled, jumped around and cursed a little. When I had finished he had little spots of blood from where the hairs had been torn out, and for 2 days after he had a weird bumpy rash. He is hesitant to try it again on the remaining hairs, and I can see why. He said getting a tattoo is way less painful."
2,Not for course hair,"I purchased this product hoping to switch to a less messy product. The hair on my calves is more course than the hair on my thighs, which is a problem for using this product. I used nearly every strip in the box trying to remove hair from my calves, and it removed a total of 12 hairs!! Works great on my thighs, however that is not worth the cost of this product. It does rinse completely away with soap and water and so do the strips as promised. If you have course hair, especially if you are a woman of color, this isn't for you. Sadly I will be going back to standard wax. :-("
4,natural and effective,"I purchased this product because it is natural and gentle on skin. I also liked that it wipes off with cold water, as opposed to oil-based removers required with conventional wax. I'm sure that this product's efficacy varies from person to person depending on method of use, as well as skin and hair type, but for me it worked just fine. It was easy to use and clean up. It didn't leave my skin as red as wax. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase."
5,BEST. WAX. EVER.,"ANYONE who had a problem is crazy. Best ever, yes a bit messy but washes off easily. Almost not pain at all. Put on thinly and you're golden! I'll never pay for waxing again...just did bikini area for a patch test, gonna try and tackle a full Brazilian ASAP! A must have!"
4,So-So,"Tired of paying so much for others to wax my facial hair so i bought this. Package came very nice. Personally, i think you have to get use to this. It does what it says but in the beginning i couldn't do it. I guess i need more practice. Overall, it is nice. Buy it & experience it!"
1,Do no waste your money,"I followed the instructions and did not work, do not waste your money really bad product. I tried to use twice but did not work."
1,Disappointed,"I followed the instructions exactly how the package told me to and this product did not work well at all. I tried a few different times, but I still wasn't happy with the results. It was painful and didn't even remove all of the hair from the few spots I tested on my legs. I also sent the company an E-mail reqesting to return it and they never wrote me back. I will never order from this company again."
3,ehh...,"Almost just the same as any other wax, seemed extra super sticky though... I'd reccommend having a second person to help with eyebrow application, ended up just trashing it because it became too sticky of a situation ...now I regularly get my eyebrows threaded instead."
5,Best hair removal product ever!,"I've been using moon hair removal wax for 3 ears since I first read about it in The Green Beauty Guide.It's superior to waxing with chemical laden wax or using chemical hair dissolving creams. It's so gentle on your skin and washes right off with warm water, do it is super easy to clean up.I use it on my legs and underarms, just be sure your hair isn't too long. This is true for any method of hit waxing: hair length should not exceed 1/4 inch.The tea tree oil in Moom prevents ingrown hair! Beautiful!"
3,works okay but hurt my skin,"worked okay .. but ouch- ripped my skin off on my upper lip. i should have probably done a test area first. it didn't rip skin off in other places i tried later though, the upper lip is just really sensitive and i had red spots for 2 weeks until it healed. i am kinda meh on this product. good part is it is easy clean up and it does work for the most part (not as well on stubborn bikini hairs though)"
4,Awesome product,"If you are used to waxing, it hurts significantly less (in my opinion at least). One thing that may worry me is how long the product is actually going to last. I think I may just have not gotten used to it yet and have been using too much. Other than that, I love the fact that its organic and the product works as expected. Just follow the directions. :)"
3,Not What Expected,"I purchased this product off the reviews it got. For clean up, definately a 5 star. For ease of use, not so much. I guess I didn't use the ""perfect amount"" or something! After trying to use on my eyebrows I gave up because it would barely remove any hair. On my legs it did ok, bikini line was ok as well. I tried a patch on my husbands' arm and it worked great, probably because the hair was so long. I waited for my hair to grow the recommended amount, a little over too, but it just wasn't as good as other products I've tried. With 2 kids ages 2 and 1 I don't have a ton of time to re-do a wax job. I am looking for success the first try. Not what I got here. Not terrible, just not up to my expectations"
4,it works!,"if you follow the instructions, it works, and it tastes good too! just follow the instructions exactly. its all natural and water soluble, so you can clean off any residue with a warm damp rag. also, rinse off the strips and dry them for reuse next time. works as well as waxing except you have to do it yourself."
4,Works well on small areas,"I have light sensitive skin and dark corse hair. I got MOOM with the intention of MOOMing my legs, however I had a difficult time. I had to go over the area several times and my skin became irritated. I tried it on my sister's legs which seemed to work better and her skin was not affected like mine.MOOM is super easy to clean up and I perfer it over my GiGi wax, but it only seemed to work well on smaller areas.I decided to go ahead and get a Braun epilator which hurts more but leave me with better results.I rated this item 4/5 because my skin and hair is the exception and on the areas where my hair is thinner (like arms) it does do its job."
4,Works as well as expected,"My only complaint is that this item should come with more strips. You can clean the strips though - I find it easiest to lay them in a shallow bowl of hot water so the wax loosens up, and then rub the wax off to clean them and let them air dry. Wax works well."
3,Not easy from the first attempt,I tried this once. It didn't work for me. I am not sure yet whether it is my lack of experience with this product or the product itself. I will give it another chance. Especially that there are some good reviews to this product which makes me think that if it works for some other people it still may work for me.
5,great buy,"very low pain-safe for even sensitive skin types & first time waxerscan leave occasional, very fine hairs behind, but also leaves skin feeling nourished and soft"
4,Great Product,"My first time using this product on my eyebrows I had only a small amount of pinkness and no sensitivity. The only problem I found was it's trouble in retrieving the short finer hairs. You must let them grow out a bit before waxing for optimal results.It cleans most of the area up well leaving you to pluck the smaller hairs.BTW, this is my husbands Amazon account(hence the male name lol) I am 100% female :)"
4,Takes off about 70% of hairs,"Well, not too exited. It takes off the hairs but very thin or not long enough stays, so it worked for me just 70%. Also not happy that it doesn't work for eyebrow correction (i can't imagine waiting till hair on my eye brows grows 0,5cm long before i can wax it off eewww)It worked on bikini area better just because hairs there were thicker. Didnt prevent from lil rash though.And 1 bottle is enough only to do legs and bikini... Not sure i will buy again. Razors are cheaper and faster to do the job."
2,it works but not on thin light hair.,i was exsited to get this in the mail. i tryed it out it warmed it up and when it got to the right thickness. i tryed it on my arm and it burned me. so i waited a few minutes for it to cool it be came goopy and still burned me. after trying it many times in different spots all same results just a burn. but my husband wanted to see what it would feel like so we tested his arm and it work well i was shock since the other reviews said thick corce hair was what it didnt work one and it did work on my hairs. after he said try a spot on his leg it is way thicker so i did it worked again. so it works for males but not on me.
5,I HAVE A QUESTION...,HEY EVERTONE IM TIRED OF SHAVING MY FACE...SO IMA GET THIS...BUT DO I NEED TO BUY A WAX WARMER FOR THIS?..
1,sucks,I ordered thinking it was going to be great because all the reviews seemed real and honest and made it sound like it really worked. But it didn't work at all. It barely took the hair off the legs. It left my lip itchy and red and barely took any hair off. The prodcut was horrible. Thank god I got a refund. This crap is going in the trash!!
2,eh.,"Maybe I didn't use it right, but I tried every way possible. A whopping 3 hairs came out from my eyebrows and maybe 2 from my boyfriend's chest. Sad day."
3,Make it yourself for much less.,"The sugar worked quite well. I have never sugared before and I may very well be a convert but despite all of the high praises for Moom, I think it is a bit overrated. I'm glad I bought this because I now know how great sugaring is (very easy, practically painless) and I now have some reusable waxing strips. Now the reason for the low score: there was not even enough product for one lower leg (I'm not exactly beastly hairy), not many waxing strips or tongue depressors provided (trying to get you into buying more of their products) and it is incredibly easy to make. It's just sugar, water, lemon juice, lavender and tea tree oils. I was ripped off but at least I now know of a way to wax effectively without going to a pricey salon in this economic climate. My advice: don't buy it, make it. There are lots of recipes online. Seriously, read the ingredients list on this. All you really need to buy is some strips, tongue depressors and a jar."
2,"Was optimistic, but it just didn't work.","I assumed by other reviews that this would probably work for me. I ordered it and studied how to use it properly. After doing everything according to direction several times, I only ended up with a really red patch of skin with less than a third of the hair pulled out. It just does not grip thick dark hairs. Perhaps it works if you have very light thin hairs, but if yours are coarse or dark DO NOT buy this. It hurt a lot and was ineffective."
2,Moom,Doesnt work really well but helps with hair removal. Probably would be easier to use if you are not using by yourself
3,"Works, but very time consuming.","I am a male, and I bought this product to try to remove hair from my chest and abs. I followed the directions, but after hours of waxing and using up all the included strips, I still had not gotten all the hair off. It took me a few sessions and many hours to finally be hair free, and the hair came back in less time than if I had depilated. If you are a female and you don't want to use this on a large area it would probably work, but guys with coarse hair, stay away from this. I have been using epilation and it is much quicker and easier. I am going to try IPL next, but nothing seems to be perfect yet."
1,Wanted it to work...and irritating,I wanted it to work. I love natural products but this one just didn't do anything for me. Tons of hair leftover and didn't even try it on bikini area. I think I must be snestive to something in it (tea tree too?) because it left my legs itchy and red and really irritated. Its worth a try if your hair is fine maybe and your skin isn't sensitive. That's not me though.
2,Prefer to wax,"Pros:Easy to clean upDoesn't hurt muchCons:Doesn't remove fine hairsTakes me multiple tries to remove anything at allHair grows back quicklyIt's just not that great. I know some people have mentioned that it just depends on how you apply it... but if it's this difficult for SO many people to do it, then I don't think it's a good product. The slight mess/pain I saved with Moom was just not worth it... going back to waxing kits!"
2,ew,"Although it was very fast shipping..I hated this product. It didnt hurt like at all, but it was super messy, I ran out of strips on my legs because it just wouldnt pull the hair out, (I even used both sides of each strip). I eventually gave up and used my eyebrow plucker to make them even (Yes this took awhile)."
4,So far so good!,"After reading through many reviews I decided to go ahead and go for it. I watched a YouTube instructional video on how to use the product most effectively (posted by Moom). The only area I planned on waxing was my upper lip, to save the time, money and hassle of going to a salon. I received it yesterday and tried it out last night and it worked great!! I don't know why some people had so much trouble with it? I followed all the instructions they gave me and it was pretty simple and not too painful. Let me preface this by also saying that this was my first time ever waxing at home with a DIY kit. I would definitely buy again and recommend this product to others."
5,Extreamly easy to use!,"I tried many hair removal product at home but Moom is the best so far. It comes with reusable fabric which lasts forever. The product itself is really good. I heated it with microwave, spread on my leg, apply the fabric and DONE! Just like that! It's easily be cleaned after you are done and doesn't leave any mess, just damp towel with water."
2,Horrible,"I was reading the reviews(only the first couple of pages) thinking that this would be good, so i ordered it, As soon as i got i was happy thinking it would work. As soon as i heated it and start putting on my legs it was so messy and sticky. It didnt come with good instructions either so i didnt know how long to keep it on or what, cause im a first time waxer i had no idea. I didnt get the wax off the first time with the strip so i had to keep doing it and at times it was painful. The wax does not come off easily either,it was literally stuck on my leg, i had to keep washing it off maybe i did not do it right but it would have been more helpful with detailed instructions for people who have never used before. never again will i use this product. The only reason i gave it a 2 was because it was fast shipping"
3,i couldn't believe it works!,"I was amazed to see this product working perfectly! I bought this to give it a try, even thought I saw many reviewers complaining. It's really good, a little painful though, but comparing to wax (which I hated after the first use) it's much better and more gentle. I have a sensitive skin, and as I expected the skin was quite red and it was irritated for a couple of days after use but I hope after repeated uses it will get better. I first tried it on my arms, where the hair is much stronger then on the legs (which I used to shave or epilate) and I was amazed to see the hair being removed so easy. Great stuff and I'm glad it's even organic!UPDATEAfter 3 uses I realize it doesn't deserve a lot of praise and I gave it 3 stars. It's easy to use and not as painful, but the hair grows back so fast, in ONE week it's back!"
3,Works well enough,"Moom removed the long hairs on my legs perfectly but left the ones that were a millimeter or less. My legs looked smooth but did not feel smooth. It works very well for removing the bulk of my unwanted eyebrow hairs, with a very little bit of tidying with the tweezers the next day after the swelling has subsided. After I used up the pot I made a batch of my own since, having used the Moom, I knew what it was supposed to look and feel like. It's decent stuff."
4,easy to use and easy on skin and not that painful -,"i have never done waxing by myself at all - but this product was easy on the skin, the wax need only medium warming (no need to really heat), and the wax is easy to wash-off, it comes with cloth-strips that are washable for re-use.take note though, this wax is most effective on hair that has grown off for some-time, not newly shaved or plucked-off hair.for this product, i recently used it for eye brows and upper lip (both areas were fine hairs) but the wax was not that effective on the new short hairs that grew on the eyebrows (lol!)"
5,First product that didn't cause irritation!,"I've used them all, and this Moom product is the first one that hasn't caused a rash or whiteheads to form on my face. I used harsher waxes for 15 years, and developed melasma from the skin layers they took off over time. This one is very gentle yet VERY effective and I am super happy with it. Will use this from now on."
5,Pulls off hair perfectly with nothing left behind,"I've used some famous brands of wax before trying Moom. I am an asian and have a very coarse, thick hair. Other brands of wax would leave a few hair strands, which I would have to get rid by plucking or shaving after I am done waxing. With Moom, I dint have to do that. It cleaned so well, I was amazed by the results. This is less painful and no mess at all. For me, Sugar wax never left such a result. I have also tried Nair wax & its smell is so over powering, by the time Im done waxing, I used to have a headache. Moom feels fresh and smooth after the job is done. The price is great! I will never go back to any other wax and would definitely recommend this to a friend."
2,Disappointing!,"I was super excited to recieve this in the mail because I had read so many rave reviews. Unfortunately this product didn't work on me at all. It barely removed any hairs, probably only 5% of them. I followed directions very closely but I still have hairy legs. It was easy to clean up and easy to clean the cloths strips that it came with but this product failed in removing hair, which is it's main purpose! :["
5,Easy and painless,"I was nervous about using this product. I had never waxed myself before but after reading the reviews, I felt I had to go for it. I was so glad I did! It was cheaper,more comfortable and certainly less painful than being waxed at a salon."
3,"Yes, it works for guys, too!","I bought this product b/c it costs 1/3 of what I would pay to have my local salon wax my chest. I learned that I would probably have been better off leaving it to a professional, being that this was the first time I've waxed and I ended up leaving (and just shaving) a few stray hairs. Maybe a set of friendly helping hands would have worked, too. It's sticky, so get ready to wash your hands a lot. I'm anxious to see how long it takes for the hair to grow back."
2,I gave it a chance....,"This hurt and it simply did not remove my hair. I would rip, and it would hurt and I would look at the strip and there would be two or three hairs on it. I followed the directions to a tee, and even used the video demonstration on their website. It did clean up well and at the price I am not angry I just wouldn't buy again, because I don't need pain without gain."
5,Tried it for the first time and it was so easy!,"I was too anxious too try it to read the instructions. It was super easy and effective! I was skeptical when I first felt the thick, sticky consistency but cleanup was incredibly easy - the product disintegrates once it comes in contact with water! I now understand why others have spent hours using this the first time they open it."
2,Doesn't work at all,"I'm used to waxing. Have used wax, sugar based products, the whole spectrum, this really doesn't attach well at all, and you have to do each area 2-3 times before you get the desired results, which means more time, and slightly raw skin.I switched to Nair's milk & honey rollon, which is also water soluble, much better results!"
2,Painful,"I don't know for other people but this product was really harsh on my skin. I tried it after carefully following the instructions. It hurt so much that I even bled a bit. This was awful for me, and If I wish to continue with this product somebody else might have to do it for me. I will not buy this product again...I'd rather shave every other day :(I gave it two stars because it actually removes all the hair (of course, if you are bad enough to yourself and pull it out quickly)."
3,A nice idea but messy and time consuming,"I really wanted to like this product but I only used it twice before I stopped bothering. It is messy, requires a lot of materials, takes a long time, is fairly painful, etc. This is definitely easier than DIY sugar waxing but isn't any better than a razor or epilator in my opinion."
1,Wax formula did work like Moom Original formula,"I have used original Moom Wax in the past, which worked perfectly. I purchased the tea tree formula hoping it would work just as well. This wax barely removes any hair! The muslin strips just remove the wax from skin."
2,I should have listened to the reviews - keep looking,"It seriously took me 15 strips to get 1/2 the hair off of my chin. And it's not because I have a ton of hair either. I waited as long as I could as the packaging suggests but let's face it-your not going to wait 2 weeks for full growth before doing this. I have very blonde very fine hairs and it just couldn't grasp them in the wax. For every 10 strips I did 3 would get some hair. Now it did work slightly better on my eyebrows which did have more than two weeks time to grow in. But again, for using 5 strips on each 3 pulled hair. This review is written on my first use. Will try again and update if it gets better. The positive is that it does come off your skin very nice.....just no hair in it!"
1,Does not work,I followed the directions exactly and even though it removed some hairs it left A LOT and my eyebrows still look un-waxed. I am very unhappy with the results of this product.
3,"Good product, but don't expect it to be painless","Just to share awareness that although the product description reads ""diminishes the pain and eliminates the discomfort of waxing and other methods"", you should not be lead to believe that this is a painless operation, and I have high pain tolerance. Ouch, mama-mia!When you evaluate 1) benefit of not having to shave as often and 2) the smoothness after usingand compare it to the pain you endure while ripping it off, I guess it's worthwhile."
4,Love it!,"The product is great, I'm quite happy w/ the results... if only more strips came with it though. I would definitely buy this again, my sensitive skin has no complaints! I wouldn't buy the pre-waxed strips again though they left this awful residue on my skin, this was nice and clean."
1,This stuff is terrible!,"I have no idea how this item has such great reviews. I trusted the reviews and tried the product. Since it was my first time using an at home wax (or waxing at all), I thought my first failure may have been my fault. So the following week I decided to try it again now that I had a bit more experience under my belt. This wax did not pick up anything! I tried it everywhere, bikini, legs, armpits. My hairs are very soft and thin. They are not thick, so I am not sure if this would work for someone with thick body hairs, but it definitely did not work for me. After multiple attempts, my skin was left red, raw and irritated, and yes, still hairy!"
5,Sold!,"I was looking for an alternative to shaving my lower legs since I only get about 2 days of smoothness before regrowth sets in. I've already tried chemical lotions and epilators with the costs not being worth the benefits. This is the first waxing/sugaring product I have tried and is likely to be the last. It was very easy to use and hardly painful at all (less than taking off a band aide). In fact, I noticed more pinching while spreading the sugar (warming the sugar decreases this) than I did pulling off the strips. Expect to make many trips to the microwave to re-heat this. Keeping it about halfway submerged in a bowl of hot water helps maintain proper temperature. Clean up was very easy. As to be expected with more sensitive skin, there was some redness which faded after about four hours. Hairs that were too short were missed, but they were so short that they weren't visible anyway. Results lasted 3-4 weeks. Regrowth is finer and less noticeable."
5,Amazing product!,"I have never written a review about anything before, but I got Moom in the mail today and WOW! This stuff is amazing. A little info about me...I've been brazilian waxing for years and I still HATE it. It hurts bad and gives me anxiety no matter what. However, I brazilianed myself today and it was almost painless. I am still in shock at how well this product works. You do have to have the technique, but I am far from a professional and the product worked great for me!!!! Seriously Moom, where have you been all my life?"
2,did not work for me,"I have tried this afew times and followed the directions. I made sure to do everything the package said and it did not take off hardly any hair. I tried it on my face, neck, bikini area, and legs. It worked ok on my face and my legs. It took some hair off my legs but only light hairs on my face but did not take hair off anywhere else. I will try again on my legs one day when I have more time. The only plus for this product is it did not bother my skin so I will try again."
2,"Very painful compared to wax, and doesnt work as well.","I bought this thinking it would be very similar to wax, removing the hair with not too terribly much pain. When I tried it out it had the complete opposite effect, this does not remove the hair very well and is VERY PAINFUL. Yes, this product is natural, but its no fun to bleed copious amounts every time you wax."
1,fail,the product didn't work waste of my money. wish i had saved the money instead of spending it on this.
1,Didn't work for me,"I followed the instructions to the letter, and while it was undeniably easier to clean up, when I pulled off the strip I found a strip full of moom, and all the hair still on my skin.I tried this multiple times with thinner applications of Moom, and different/smaller areas of skin. No luck. This went in the garbage."
2,"Moom---30-day guarantee inaccurate, and truly difficult to use","This sounded to good to be true. it is extremely difficult to use alone,m effectively. Unless you have someone you really want to see your most intimate parts, and that, for me is not going to happen..somethings are better left unshown.A PROFESSIONAL WAXER DOES A MUCH MORE THOROUGH JOB AND WITHOUT THE INCREDIBLY MESSY AND INCONSISTENT EFFECTS.Due to a very understandable no return policy on Amazon for this product, I went to Moom itself to get info on shipping it back. The costs for me to absorb for shipping and offering only a fraction of what I paid to do so, meant I would literally take a LOSS financially.Amazon is amazing - truly. But from my standpoint, Moom (and likely many other home waxing kits are simply not worth the time, mess, and poor results -- beware--you lose $$$ when trying this at home."
4,what a workout!,"I use this several times a week, and the advanced exercises are super hard! Variations of the basir routine are enough to keep the abdominals tight. I have a six-pack at 50!"
4,"DVD works fine, good suppliment to workouts","Picked it up at Target. Everything worked fine out of the box. The DVD is well done and provides a good workout. I like to use it for ab work in between sets of other exercises. Resistance is great, and the handles make it a lot easier to use than normal medicine balls."
3,"great ball, lousy DVD","I got the abs ball tonight and I'm very excited to use it for some variety (I usually do straight abs DVDs with no equipment). However, the free DVD is terrible:- the advanced routine feels like you're doing something, but the beginner one is a joke, so there's ultimately only 1 10-minute routine I can use with this ball. For $40 I would prefer to have a few routines I could alternate- hopefully they'll make a second DVD... (and the beginner/advanced routines repeat many of the exercises so I can't mix and match)- the guy leading the routine WOULD NOT SHUT UP. It's good to give information for beginners who might not know about back safety and that it's okay to start with fewer reps, but it interferred and drove me nuts: I frequently found myself waiting for him to finish talking so we could begin the exercise"
4,Feeling it.,"I received the product about 5-days after I ordered it (and I live in Hawaii). The product packaging was crazy--three nested boxes with air packets.The DVD worked and I did the workout for the first time yesterday. The exercise sequence made sense and was easy to do (beginner version). The only issue I had was that the handles weren't too comfortable in the plank position.I can't speak about results yet seeing as I did it for the first time yesterday, but I am feeling it in my abs today. It's effective and not time consuming. I feel like I've worked my abs as well with this product as I have during an hour-long pilates class (I took reformer classes for two years). I can't wait to try the advanced workout."
4,Abs Ball,"Good product, the DVD that came with the ball is easy to follow and really helps you get started. I had no issues with the DVD playing unlike other reviews I have read. The only issue I had is the distinct petroleum smell of the ball so be aware of it if you plan to keep it inside your living space. I thought it might dissipate over time but it's still pretty strong."
2,Smelly Ball,Have had the ball for a month and it still smells as awful as the day when I opened the box. I don't think the smell will go away unfortunately. Strong rubber smell that's hard to ignore when you're trying to work out. Video tape is ok--nothing special. I think I wasted money on this one.
2,Hmm...,"The ball is very oily and after a month it still has that oily smell and feel to it. I have a wooden floor and it leaves oily spots on the floor, which can be very slippery if you don't clean it right away.The workout dvd has a decent workout (the advanced one I'm talking about, they beginner's workout is hardly a challenge after a couple of times)."
2,didn't last,"I purchased this a few years ago from gaiam. It was great for a couple of years. I rarely used the video and just did my own collection of moves, mostly situps and upper body raises to work on abs. The seam has now completely separated along one side, so it completely is deflated and no longer useful. Now I am online searching for another brand and thought I would post a review here. Overall, this one is good for short term, but not made to hold up."
1,DVD doesn't work!,The DVD will not run in any of my players...I would really like to try this work out...but without the instructions it's hard to do! I'm hoping to find another DVD to go with the ball!
1,Too much trouble,"The included DVD did not work. Amazon sent me a replacement kit but that DVD didn't work either. I returned them both. The I bought the kit from a Target store, and of course that DVD didn't work either! I sent a complaint to Gaiam by email and they sent me a working DVD without the need to return anything, plus a $10 coupon. The workout is good but not worth the trouble."
1,"If you want me to buy it, at least show what the product look slike!","I'm not interested in a partial photo of a product inside the box. I'm baffled as to why they company selling this Abs ball only show a tiny photo of someone using it...not large enough to get an idea how it works.Next time, actually show the item and I'll consider spending my $30 on it."
1,How can I write a review for this product? I haven't received the replacement yet!,How can I write a review for this product? I haven't received the replacement yet! The one I initially received was dented! So annoying! It'll be a while before I order something through Amazon.com again.
4,Best overall source available,Because of cd collecting being relatively new there hasn't been an established price guide so some pricing may be off. However this guide cotains a great deal of cd information and goes a long way in identifying rare and collectable cd's. When I first purchased this book about 6 years ago I wasn't even aware of collectable cd's. Since then I found countless rare and valuable cd's in used cd bins.
1,Not as useful as I expected it might be.,"Aside from the numerous errors and inaccuracies I found just skimming through the book, I found that it lacked information that might be useful to collectors who wanted to know about dealers and internet sites that specialize in the kinds of CDs found in the book. Their much touted web site proved to be a wild goose chase too. Not recommended."
2,"informative, but lacks listing information","for the curious CD collector, a nice book to read. however, for the collector, you will not find accurate values, and the listings are lacking severely. there are complete band discographies not listed. more than half of my rare CD collection is not found in this book, and many, many titles are very well known. on the other hand, if you want to see some nice shots of promo, press kits, and limited CDs, there are some good ones here. also, CD technology, care, specifications, and history, also a good source. but im sorry, for identifying, and pricing....not a chance this book will be of much use to you. this book should be retitled not to include ""price guide"". decide what information you need before you buy this one, i wish i hadn't."
1,"Life With Elizabeth, Volume 3","I have been in contact with Amazon.com about removing their recommendation to buy Life With Elizabeth, Volumes 3 and 4 if you have already bought volumes 1 and 2. If you have bought volumes 1 and 2, do not buy volumes 3 and 4 because they are an exact duplicate of each other; volumes one and three contain the same stories and volumes two and four totally repeat each other."
2,"Great Movies, Horrible DVD","-Heather's teenage son.-Deep Red is a great movie, Silent Night Bloody Night is a campy classic. But, this double-sided DVD does both of them NO JUSTICE. Buy them separately. The DVD wasn't even worth the dollar I paid for it."
4,The Celebrity,"Robert Elmer accomplishes in a story what some of us would like to do in reality--go for what our hearts really want. His characters take a deep look at where they are in life, where others want them to be, and where they want to be. Read The Celebrity to find out how Jamie and Anne fill their hearts desire. Good read."
2,"Low Price, Low Quality",I bought the phone because of it's reasonable price.My two big issues were: 1. Could only use the speakerphone if all other phones in house were on hook. If even one other phone on hook and the volume on the speaker was so low that you could not carry on a conversation (even with volune on high).2. The hook-flash mechanism jammed. The phone was thus always on hook. This was after only 2 months of use.Save yourself the aggravation; stay away from GE phones!
2,One fatal flaw,"I bought this inexpensive phone and thought I'd found a great value. The speaker worked very well. Then I dicovered that the phone would pick up a local radio station. Specifically, it was something about the way the phone base interacted with the handset and handset cord. The longer the cord was stretched, the better the reception! A second phone of the same model did the same thing. I tried using the handset and cord from a different model, but it still did the same thing. Disconnecting the handset elliminates the problem, but who wants a phone without a handset? Since the main reason I wanted a speaker phone is for those pesky times I'm put on hold, this inadvertant radio reception is a double whammy. If I'm on hold and somehow get cut off, I don't want to be hearing a local radio station and mistake it for on-hold-muzak. The engineers should have caught this one. Back she goes."
5,Excellent phone for a great price,"The phone is sturdy. The handset delivers clear sound... asdoes the speakerphone (surprisingly!). On a pulse line, switching totone is as simple as pressing the star key--no need to wrestle with the switch. I am amazed at how much phone I got for such a small price!"
2,cheap phone,"The handset on this phone buzzs, but the speaker portion works fine. Overall it is a cheap phone and you get what you pay for."
2,Lasted one year,"Mine broke after about a year. When I replace the headset, it doesn't break the connection. I have to unplug it to get a dial tone."
2,Only one problem....,"I just purchased this phone two weeks ago and it's been a great phone, except for one thing I discovered- the phone will not work if any other phone in my house is picked up while I am on a conversation, or if another phone is already in use. Both the Speakerphone and Hold bottons light up and the phone is ""paralyzed"" until it's the only phone in use. I am curious if anyone else has had this problem as well. I've never had a phone that simply stops working in this manner. The worst thing about it is that if I'm talking on the phone and someone in my house picks up (accidentally or on purpose), my phone stops working until that person has hung up.I wouldn't recommend this phone because of that flaw, but if you don't mind it, then it's fine.I ended up returning this phone and received a full refund."
2,Nice Overview,Disappointing. Well-written overview but not enough specific information. I had hoped for so much more. I would have also liked more information about how the Civil War affected the people living in the Ozarks.
1,Civil War history lite.. skip it.,"Treats some of the stories of the Civil War in the west without explaining the larger issues. This is an inexpensive book, but not necessarily a good value."
1,not full order,The item discription was for all 5 volumes of the books. Only one arrived. I called and they had good customer service and re funded my money but they said theu only had the one book to begin with.
5,Paramedic Books,The information for this product should mention it comes with CD's and online access code included. The condition of the books is excellent.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased these books ""new"" and they came with dents and dings in them from what looked like careless packaging. These books cost $231. This does not make me happy. I only gave this a two rating because of the speed in which they came. Very unhappy"
1,Why waster your money?,"There is little point to buy this book unless you wanted a printed copy with a CD-ROM since the author has made and keep updated the website containing the same information.Of course, it doesn't mean the content, which is basically just a list and short explanation of a vast range of sound/music related software, is bad especially for linux beginners. However, at this price, I cannnot recommend to buy one."
4,a long time in coming,Great diapers but they took forever to complete the order. By the time they arrived at my house my son was deciding between boxers or briefs.
3,Pampers Easy Ups vs Huggies Pull Ups,"I tried these Easy Ups for the first time but went back to his old ""Pull Ups"". These Easy Ups do not open and re-close on the side like Pull Ups do. However these Easy Ups are thicker, which is good at night. But for our purposes it's just more convenient to use the Huggies Pull Ups to transition from regular diapers."
3,"Not bad, but not as good as PullUps","We have purchased both Easy Ups and Pull Ups for our 3-year-old son. He is a reluctant potty user, so we've used plenty. I have to say that I prefer the Huggies Brand Pull Ups because of their easy open sides (which are resealable if he is still dry!) and because they do not leave linty bits on my son's skin."
1,easy up? thumbs down,very disappointed much smaller than size 5 pullups! even my skinny kid finds them too small
5,"Great pull-ups, even for nighttime!","When I was potty training my two-year-old I tried several options for nighttime, but these were the only pull-ups that didn't leak if he had an accident during the night. They were also very easy for him to put on and take off."
4,excellent summary of a great tournament,"only negative point... it could always show more shots and more players, but the dvd delivers an excellent summary of the tournament, shows a lot of great golf shots and emotions."
1,Not one of Hess's best,"This book actually has no plot, no suspense, and very poorly written. The outcome of each situation is so predictable as to delete any interest you may have. Storm and Flame have very little repore' and very little interaction. Then there is Shilo and Little Bird. One minute he hates her and the next he's crazy about her. When Shilo and Flame try to make Shilo and Little Bird jealous we never find out if Storm every actually understands what they were plotting. I felt as though I was reading a 5th grade pupil's writing. Norah Hess can do better than this."
3,A shame,"This one started out so awesome with an alluring setting and mystery that Cusick always delivers...but the ending I have to say took away the mystery and just made it seem unrealistic. I'm a loyal fan so I've collected this one, but it wasn't the of the best Cusick has ever written.I get that the usage of triplets in a mystery kinda takes away from the mystery(character), but revealing at the end that the twins are in fact triplets and that Edwin (the third brother revealed at the end) is the bad guy is what in fact made me lose interest. The rest of the book is classic Cusick; riveting."
1,Upsetting,"I was so angry when I finshed this book I almost cried. Richie's other books are SO much better than this! The whole idea of adding a new character that was- I'll just say 'significant'- to the plot in like the LAST SEVEN PAGES was INSANE! It's like she couldn't think of any way to end it, and I honestly can't blame her, because the seconf half of the book is entirely confusing and filled with un-needed words.Please, if you're like me, and are a big fan of Cusick's, stick to ""Vampire,"" ""The Mall,"" or esp. ""The Lifegaurd.""But I do not reccommend this one."
5,NEED A GOOD RAINY DAY BOOK?,"Silent Stalker is a wonderful book by a wonderful author.The book begins with a girl and her reporter father traveling to an old castle {althought no getting along very well} But what will happen when they run into trouble and the only place to stay is in the castle itself???I RECOMMEND this book. I couldn't even begin to tell you how many times I've read it. Thousands at least! And once you read this book by Richie, then I bet you'll get hooked and read more of her stories. I collect her books and love every single one. SILENT STALKER IS A MUST HAVE!!! ~5 STARS~"
1,Complete customer service failure.,"So the book description says: ""Each new copy of the text includes access to ThomsonNOW(tm), an online personalized learning system that will save you time in studying and help you prepare for exams through a series of diagnostic tests and personalized study plans.""Which would be great except the first copy I ordered had NO code. After calling the ""contact us"" # from the inside of the book cover AND trying to access their online help which always results in an error, I returned the book to Amazon who was nice enough to send me a new copy...which had NO code.Still on hold with the publisher. Still trying to get something besides an error message from their online help.This has been such a frustrating process that I don't really care anymore if the book has good content.Amazon: helpfulThomson/Cengage: not helpful"
2,mediocre,"I adopted this text for my first try at teaching intro astronomy. It has lots of pretty pictures but I was not impressed with the content. This includes the text, the organization and the question/problem sets. If this text is better than most of its competitors, I am in real trouble. =-)"
1,SLOW!,"I ordered the book two and a half weeks ago and it still hasn't come. If you're a student, textbooks are required ASAP so her tardiness has put me in a bad place in my class early in the semester. If you want to pass your class, don't order from her!"
1,Run don't walk AWAY!,"Author claims to be ""non-Sense"" - and in my mind he is. But his is the only things ""different"" about this book. His ""only"" twist is that is tends to showcase the ""risk"" whereas the others showcase the ""reward"". This book is not worth the read or money."
2,Demetri Chrysostomou PhD,"This book would read as an excellent syllabus for real estates investing. It touches on all the topics with endless lists: ""3 things you need to know..."" ""12 reasons why... """"real estate investing depends on...""6 key factors that..."". These lists are not explained in depth, are difficult to digest without prior practical experience and quickly become tiresome.The book falls short on the ""How you can"" part of its title. All the pointers for real estate investing are there but inexperienced real novices like me need some initial hand holding and guidance which this book fails to offer. The first page states ""After you read, study, and fully understand the contents of this book, you'll have the equivalent of a graduate level degree on how to be a do-it-yourself real estate investor."" Well you won't, but at least you'll know whats on the syllabus."
2,WHERE'S THE REST OF THE BOOK?,"When I read the table of contents, I thought this book covered it all and ordered it immediately. Then I began reading and realized the whole book was like an EXTENDED table of contents with 3 or 4 sentences devoted to each topic. You will need many more books to get an understanding of any one concept presented here. Maybe that's exactly what Mr. Lucier was counting on...."
2,man hoodwinked,"This is a very mixed up film, unsure of how it wants to portray its story. Just exactly what does it have to do with manhood? Is it a coming of age story? Is it a comedy? Some of the characters are so over the top they border on unbelievability, unless this is just a tongue-in-cheek approach. But the movie eventually hopscotches into some not-funny drama, carrying a sense of urgency that begins to endear us to some of the characters. Then out of the blue, the movie lurches into tragedy, not well placed nor well explained. I know a movie can portray a number of different themes, but this one is not done well. And that's too bad, because there is the possibility of a story here. It's just not executed well."
1,This review is for the audio cds,"I borrowed these cds from the library because I'm interested in corporate governance and case studies. I'm not an expert on Enron, but this felt like fiction from the first couple of minutes. When the narrator speaks for Ken Lay, he uses a deep, fatherly voice. Andy Fastow's voice is whiny and child-like. Its content is obviously biased and selective. So from a factual standpoint, I'm not learning a heck of a lot.As fiction, it's way too long at 25 cds; should be abridged by about 2/3. There's just not that much content, and it's often painful to listen to. If I didn't have a one-hour commute to fill, I'd have given up on it hours ago.I highly recommend The Smartest Guys in the Room instead."
2,The only fools are those who believe this book is accurate!,"I hope Ken Lay gives Kurt Eichenwald a share of his proceeds, because it is clear Ken wrote this favorable bull@#$% and Kurt merely signed his name. I gave this 2 stars because the names are spelled correctly."
2,"good, if accounting entertainins you","im reading this book for extra credit in an accounting class, its not the most exciting book, a lot of technical accounting terms that i wouldnt understand if i wasnt in that class. But Eichenwald does do a good job of taking the whole story and turning into a novel and not just a list of facts and events that lead up to Enrons fall."
4,Excellent rendition of events,"This book is very accurate on the facts presented about the deals. It does portray some of the higher-ups as a little cleaner than we otherwise might find to be the case. It does not discuss all the nasty deals but does capture some of the more sinister ones in excellent detail. With all the coverage on this case and the various writings/information sources out there, this book by far paints the most complete condensed picture of the inner workings.I cannot fault the writer for not catching what is in my opinion the most dastardly act of all, as no one else has since this case has unfolded. Maybe someday we will all hear about it, or maybe it will never see the light. The author is so close to the subject matter it isn't funny. If the reader is very familiar with the litigation cases, maybe you can put the last puzzle piece in place and write the last chapter.Well worth the read!"
2,Could have been written by Ken Lay,"This was the first of three books and numerous articles I have read about the Enron catastrophe. This one seems to take great pains to exonerate Ken Lay. Everything is someone else's fault.There is a lot of interesting and factual information here, but most of it seems twisted to protect Ken Lay and lay all the blame on Andy Fastow. While Fastow is certainly a crook, the main problem with Enron was not the end-stage shenanigans, but the way the company was run, the way commissions and bonuses were paid for lousy deals, Enron's system of robbing California and other states of billions of dollars, that really caused the problems. Ken Lay ran Enron the way George Bush ran the US economy, and got similar results. (It didn't help that Lay/Enron was Bush's biggest financial backer since the early 1990's, either.)[...]"
5,WIsh I had an accounting degree!,"The book, as advertised, races forward with incredible detail and terrific storytelling.I work in finance and still found some of the complexities of these deals mind-numbing. I still don't understand how a company expected to hedge its own profits with its own stocks. Or something. Obviously no one else did either.Doesn't really matter, there is enough greed, arrogance and finger-pointing to keep you reading for hours.One of the best corporate conspiracy books ever written."
3,ENRON's indicted CEO couldn't resurface at a worse time ....,"The subject of ENRON, greed and corportate corruption seems a vague memory for many Americans. Ordinary media has all but packed away discussion about what seemed a convoluted accounting problem but Eichenwald's title or pehaps,my pick for best ENRON title of 2002-Texas investigative journalist Robert Bryce's book PIPE DREAMS should be mandatory reading for all Americans! The intrigue and mesh of relationships in Texas' good ole boy bidnez network deserves to be scrutinized particularly since America is now represented globally by CEO Bush. An important read."
1,Mind Blowingly Dull,"I gave the author a couple of chapters to warm up, but the speed and monotony of this book is mind numbing."
4,Comprehensive Character List and Complex Issues,Without going in to great detail about the book - I am sure we all know it dealt with the collapse of one of corporate Americas' big swingers. The book contained quite a deal of information about events from inside Enron. I guess the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the author had a way of really annoying me by trying to write the book as a novel (in places). I look forward to the movie - hopefully the ending is better for the investors.
4,"How easily the ""system"" failed.","You will be amazed at how Enron was able to frustrate every check and balance in place in American Finance. The SEC, individual and institutional investors, auditors, lawyers, accountants, rating agencies, banks, creditors, peers, and even insiders were blindsided by a couple of smart but foolhardy executives who were willing to exploit every loophole in the name of manufacturing *profits* (and not products).All in all a very readable and addictive book."
5,A master storyteller,"An excellent read. Eichenwald seems to have been near the heart of very troubling business, and takes you on a guided tour through the minds of several shady high-rollers. Make time for this book. Eichenwald is a master storyteller."
3,MONKEYIN AROUND,"Cannell is best when he sticks to high-octane, energetic pacing and stronger characters. What we get in RUNAWAY HEARTS is a story that takes forever to kick into high octane gear, and we get as secondary characters, both seen and unseen, of Donald Trump, Barbra Streisand, James Brolin, Jim Carrey, Mary Steenburgen and Ted Danson. It's like Cannell is showing how he panders with the upper crust celebrities. Cute, but rather unbelievable.The plot is straightforward, although Cannell doesn't have to let the reader know on every other page, how ""ugly and fat"" Herman Strockmire is, or how ""beautiful"" his daughter Susan is. Judge Melissa King is too much of a villain to be believable, and the chimera aren't used enough to generate the suspense. There are some witty scenarios, and some black humor; and the ending picks up the pace considerably, but this is not Cannell at his best, as evidenced in his Shane Scully series."
4,A Thriller!,"If you are a person who wants to believe in conspiracy theories or believe that anything is possible, this is the novel for you. There are government biologically enhanced animals;bad guys; a group of soldiers who do only what they are told; a brief showing of Donald Trump; mention of Barbara Streisand; a pain-ridden ex-cop who is falling for a beautiful attorney, who is the daughter of the main character; a main character who is a zealot for environmental and conspiracy issues. It is a delightful, fast moving story that is extremely enjoyable."
4,A Team Meets X Files,"Rather than summarize the book, as other reviewers have so skillfully done I recommend this book as an exciting page turner. Difficult to put down. SJC writes primarily about the LAPD beat and adds a bit of the x files. I really wanted to know more about ""Pan"" and his training, development and breeding. A better twist might have been if the DNA was alien or such. The Donald Trump addition was priceless. What ever happened to Pan after he wounded and ran away and disappeared, I've looked back several times and can't seem to find out what happened to him. If anyone knows please post. All in all it is a good quick read, possible made for TV movie."
5,Most Enjoyable,"This is a book that is a little bit of John Grisham and Michael Crichton, but mostly it is Stephen Cannell. It holds your attention, challenges your ideas of what is credible, makes you laugh, makes you think and always entertains you. I looked forward to picking it up and continuing along with the story of the Don Quixote of the legal community in California as he tilted at windmills and the judiciary that thought him unworthy. However, one of his windmills turned out to be real and also deadly and how that all gets exposed and dealt with is a most entertaining story and a tale worth reading and thinking about. Let's hope that the technology which is in the book is not available today. The fly leaf says it is. If so, we all have something to think about."
4,Manstein's Views on the various incidents of WWII,"Without going into the particular details of the memoirs of General von Manstein, it must be said that it is a very important contribution to the the overall history of the Second World War. He certainly was one of the most brilliant of all the German strategists. Personally,in my opinion it is a toss-up between Marshal Manstein, Marshal Rommel and Marshal Ritter von Leeb. Rommel was of course the ""Star of Africa"", a title held beside him by only Hans-Joachim Marseille, the highest-scoring fighter ace on the Western Front. And Leeb was a defensive genius, whose talents could have been better utilized. This book is about retelling his side of the story, the trials and successes across all the fronts, but what one also finds is that he glosses over various things, like the dismissal of Count Sponek, and of course the Kursk fiasco. Despite all that it is still a good account of the war from the personal viewpoint of a field marshal."
3,Not so hot,"Detailed military reference to German units without enough overview. Hitler fired this General for not being aggresive enough/taking chances; the General in turn blamed Hitler for being a bad military leader. If you're interested in this General there's a better bio titled 'Manstein, Hitler's Greatest General'."
4,Excellent First Person Account,"This is a good read and there is alot of interesting information in this book. But also get: ""Stalingrad: Memories and Reassessments"", which has a rebuttal of a large part of this book by a Stalingrad survivor."
4,A good read,"This book was a very good read, but I wouldn't believe everything he says either. However, if you're interested inthe Russian Front Campaign and the events surrounding the disaster the Germans never recovered from at Stalingrad, this book will put a lot of those events into perspective."
2,Lost Victories,Not as good as I had hoped.Too much information for me. I didn't finish the book because I lost interest.
1,No color keys included with these charts,"None of the charts included with this calendar include a key linking the symbols on the charts to the DMC color code numbers. The author asks the stitcher to match the picture and chart to a DMC color code card which is time consuming and boring, and likely to lead to errors from the original design. Major flaw."
1,NO COLOR KEY SYMBOL CHART,"I agree with the previous reviewer. Although many patterns to choose from and a DMC floss color key, the pattern symbols do not have a chart that corresponds to the coordinating color key that is included; therefore the color key has no purpose. After contacting the publisher, Accord Publishing, it was suggested that I create my own color codes for each symbol and that due to space constraints, a symbol chart was intentionally not included. I will not be purchasing another calendar from this publisher or author."
4,In Honored Glory,"Great book about the history of Arlington National Cemetery. It's a history of Arlington as well as devoting one to two pages to stories about some of the individuals that are buried there. Interesting little-known facts are in the book throughout. Truly pays respect those that rest at Arlington. Anyone going to Arlington should have this book, indispensable. RECOMMENDED."
5,Is Gordon wearing a banana clip in his hair?!!?,"Well, what can one say about the Femmes live outside of they're always great, no matter what time period you catch them in? You can't, so I won't. Well, maybe one more thing: These jerks don't age. Must be something in the beer and cheese in Wisconsin.This DVD is pretty much a VHS to DVD transfer of a PAL VHS release from early in the band's history. It's the latest in their series of plundering the vaults for archival material. Do you need this? Yes, of course.Even the IRS era R.E.M.-aping concert/film splicing is enjoyable for anyone over 25 who watched this sort of thing on 120 Minutes/The Cutting Edge before we had to deal with whiny millionaires moping over a Fender Mustang before blowing their heads off (only good thing Cobain did and he took too long to do that).Still, the lads need to put something else out, something NEW out.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
3,Timer controlled Charger,"These type of charger seems to control the charging time by a timer that starts when you plug into power outlet. If you do not unplug it first before next use it will not restart charging. Very low tech if that is the case, and Kodak (or Energizer) may not want you to know it. I have one of these."
3,More info!,"I have the K200 charger but can find little tech. info. on it. Do the green lights indicate a charged, or a discharged condition? Some of the reviews/descriptions of this charger make it sound as if it will charge regular or alkaline AA and AAA batteries. I don't know much about batteries, but I'm pretty sure they have to be Ni-MH or Ni-CD batteries (size AA or AAA) to be rechargable. Attempting to recharge regular or alkaline batteries might be hazardous."
1,"Horrible, Do not buy!","The blades are dull and crooked. The craftsmanship is horrible: it looks like child designed and put this item together. I wish I could put a picture up so you could see the crooked lines at the joints, etc. I contacted the seller immediately to return this item, but it's been over a month and I haven't heard back. Terrible experience. Waste of money. Don't buy."
2,DOES NOT CLIP CUTICLE AS IT SHOULD,The cuticle nippers were not as sharp as I imagined it would be. The have to press hard for the cuticle to be cut. Otherwise I would end up pulling at the cuticle and that is not a good thing to do. I felt it was not an original La Cross product given the dissatisfaction it caused me. But I cannot be sure of it.
2,"Had a high expectation, poor results.","Overall, I ordered this as my first Gundam model kit. Here's my review as a hobbyist.The pictures of the model you get are very nice and show very good craftsmanship, but the amount of effort required to even get similar results is too much. Some parts are loose and one instance is that the upper arm piece did not fit the elbow joint in the forearm, the opening is too big so the arm simply falls out. The model isn't the same colors as the display pictures or box art, so you need to do some painting, a LOT of it. The model requires a lot of touch up, and you shouldn't use the stickers, unless you just want to build the model, just for the sake of putting it together. Again in my cast the model won't even be complete unless I glue the arm in, or do some extensive fixes. Again that is just in my case.The model isn't ""High Grade"" it's more of a ""Meh Grade""."
5,It looks pretty good after a paint job,"it was a fun model to build, lotsa little pieces that kept falling off, but i ultimately built the whole thing right. after painting the model black with red lines, it looked rad. just dont play around with it too much, cause its easy to break. also, the stickers were pratically useless to me."
2,Better Out There,There are more books out there by Troy that are 5 star. To me this one seems to be just excerpts from some of his others works.Wicked Decatur (IL)is well worth the money if you are interested in the crimes and crooked politicians.
2,One Man Farce -Ode to the late Johnny Matuszak,"Died of drug overdose, despite, in hereplaying a cop trying to stop drug dealers...What's wrong with this picture? Plenty!Robert Tessier, aka 'The Bald Guy', fromBurt Reynolds movies and from Dave Carra-dine's Future Farce, er, ah Force is theonly actor that stands out in here - untilThe 'Tooz crushes him with a coke machine!Waht a way to go...""A parachute not opening,that's thw way to go"" - Leslie Nielsen, Or,""Having sex with Jewel..."" -R.A.S..."
1,Outstanding. Dire.,"This film came in a 2 disc 4 film dvd package called Tough Guys. It is very slightly better than one of the other films which came with the package, called Hangmen, which is the worst film I have ever seen. One Man Force was extremely similar, and in fact I found it difficult to decide which of the two efforts made it to the far end of movie execrability, but finally decided that Hangmen just had the edge on OMF, because the plot, or non-plot, of OMF was almost comprehensible, unlike the plot of Hangmen. Also, the star, J.Matuszak, under expert direction, could almost be envisaged playing the Incredible Hulk, with or without green paint. His character had motivation. But that was all."
5,A CRIMINAL JUSTICE STUDENT,"I think this book is a really good tool to learn from for a person that just wants to see how Death Investigation works and for a serious person pursuing a job in the area. I got the book and I couldn't put it down for a minute. At my school, the University of Alabama, we don't have any forensics classes in the criminal justice department on death investigation and when I saw this book I knew it was for me. I have learned so much from this book on all forms of death and this has really sparked my interest in getting a job as a forensic investigator. This book shows you that you never know what will happen next. But most importantly, it covers all the issues down to the precise detail and the right procedure on how to investigate. I know one thing for sure, if I get into this line of work, this book will be like my best man if I ever need a reference."
1,WHY NO PAL,I am disappointed that the Amazon online marketing system did not pick up on the fact that when ordering from Australia the known operating system is PAL and Amazon sent me products that do not work in Australia. I have communicated this with marketing people and am still waiting on confirmation that the monies transacted have been returned to my credit account. Can somebody in Amazon Accounts be as efficient in returning my money as they were in taking it!Geoff Chambers.PS Is there a list of PAL music DVDs that Amazon sell???
3,Could Be Better,"This DVD tried to cover so many artists and yet left out many other important artists as well. It is quite disorganized, jumping back and forth. If you watch it carefully, there are quite a lot of repeats. It has an amazing collection of many once in a lifetime performances. Some performances I enjoyed very much included the Cream's Sunshine of Your Love, Santana's Black Magic Woman, the Righteous Brothers' You've Lost That Lovin'Feelin', the Byrds' Turn Turn Turn, The Mamas & Papas California Dreamin', and of course Fleetwood Mac's Lanslide and Say You Love Me. Overall, it is an importance piece of music history."
3,a rich but sloppy compilation & no Led Zeppelin; Bee Gees get crewcut,"this could have been great & definitive. i havent played all 9 dvds yet, but am frustrated how years & artists are thrown across multiple discs. like the Beatles performance is on disc 1 & Mick Jagger's induction speech for them is on disc 2. another example, U2s acceptance is on disc 3, but their induction is on disc 2.& the glaring omission of Led Zeppelin.& no respect for the Bee Gees. they get severely cut for no good reason. u get 45 secs of Massachusetts & 90 secs of You Should Be Dancing. theyre good enough to be inducted so they should be good enough to be uncut.there's definitely some bias here. the Pretenders survive the cuts & scattering here the best with their induction, acceptance & 3 songs intact & in order. thats the way the other inductees should have treated here.but this is what's available to us, so we have no other choice.so 5 stars for the material minus 2 stars for very poor editing."
2,Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Live,"I had such anticipation upon receiving this product, based on the preview video clips I had watched. This 3 disc set was quite the dissapointment. It's very unorganized, it's editing seems to be all over the place. I was very upset that I spent the money I did for it."
2,Rock N Roll Hall of Fame Review,This was advertised as the 25th anniversary Rock N Roll Hall of Fame concert. It is not. It is a compilation of concerts from the previous years with some of this years concert included. I was disappointed and may even return the item.
2,Rock & roll hall of Fame Live,"I just played the 1st DVD and as soon as I heard the sound I knew that I was not going to like it. It is not only the picture quality that you look at. Most importantly it is the sound.In this day and age when you have such good quality Hi-Fi Equipment such as 7.1 channel etc, you expect to hear good sound. I don't think that I will ever watch this DVD as my main interest is the quality of sound. Don't the recording Engineers listen to these DVD's before putting them out for sale.Anyway there you go."
1,dont buy it,it was great news to hear of this release. so i forked out and brought it for the mamas and papas section. but it has been cut and not a single glimpse of cass in her hey day the speaches were cut. also no induction for them (shnia twain did this in 98). timelife seem to do this with all there releases . my advice try and buy the groups and performers you want from other sources. you might be disappointed
2,Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Live,"Its not the product quality or shipment that I was disappointed with, it was the content. Not as good as I had hoped."
3,"Should be titled ""un-leaded""","So many duplicates, I mean how many times do i need to see Springsteen and Eddie Vedder? How bout some Jerry Lee Lewis or Little Richard? People that shaped rock! And to leave out Led Zeppelin is just shamefull. The performances that are there are nice, but the ones missing, greatly outshine them."
4,Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Live,"Not the greatest quality footage. Cameras not ideally positioned. On the positive side, hours of amazing musicians doing their stuff with their pals on stage. Some amazing jamming."
4,very good,I ordered this for my dad and i got it with it said I would and he loves it!!! I recommend this set to anyone who loves rock and roll and want a piece of their history for their collection!!!!
2,very disapointed by this,"After watching the Rock and Roll Hall 25th anniversary special, I had had high expectations for this dvd set. Unfortunately, I found myself very bored throughout.The editing is terrible in that inductee speeches are chopped about and the whole video had poor flow. I much appreciate the history and relationships of these artists and found this dvd set added very little to my rock and roll appreciation."
4,Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Live,"If you don't like this one your way to picky! A lot of this film is vintage but in great shape through it all. It was money well spent. If you love rock and roll, your going to appreciate this DVD. I gave it 4 stars and would've gave it 5 but I'm not really a big Springsteen fan. He managed to get his over expressive face in several shots. Still the same, two thumbs up."
5,Horror in the East,"You want to know why Nagaski and Hiroshima were Sadly done? look at this documentary and the kami-kaze,the sadistic Japanese at the time,it's treatment of prisoners of war and you will see something was needed. Yes War is hell and it claims the innocence as well who are caught up. This is an interesting Look from the BBC."
1,Contrast justifying JAPANESE turn to torture,"Movie lacked depth of proof only showing blurry images in most cased of actual events.. Showed the same torture and pictures for all/most areas. Tortures shown was beating, used for bayonet and target practice, lack of food and torture for no reason. Did cover parts of WWII most never new about and did try to explain how the Japanese turned from civilized western beliefs and conduct in WWI to pure torture and using religion to insure NO ONE SURENDERS ""you must die for the emperor"" and you will go to heaven and the emperor will pray for you.. I also found it offensive that the only (American?) told how he and other smashed open the mouths of the dead ""Japs"" to get their gold fillings. I doubt that the poor peasants that fought could afford a dentist let alone gold fillings."
2,Ostentatious whining,"Ostentatious whining, with an accent, about self initiated contemptible behavior of a free, well educated, unencumbered adult who can't whip his way out of wet paper conscience. Go figya."
2,Not enough examples...,"This book is difficult to understand due to the lack of simple examples to illustrate keep points as they are introduced.There are a few examples in each chapter, however the authors skip too many steps and make you constantly flip around in the book to review previous examples upon which he bases the new examples. The end result is just wasteful trashing by the student.This is a good book, but it does't have enough textbook examples to be used for an intro class in Kalam filtering.Maybe this book would be useful as a secondary reference for a person that already knows Kalman filtering."
3,Some People Hitchhike for a Reason,"Don DiLego was inspired by a homeless man on the NYC subway to write all of The Lonestar Hitchhiker while traveling cross-country on Route 66. I didn't like Kerouac's On The Road much in college so I really shouldn't be surprised that this album didn't do much for me either. DiLego is not without famous traveling companions however as Imani Coppola guests on the title track and DiLego managed to wrangle his way into recording at NYC's Electric Lady studios. ""Nicotine Prom Queen"" is catchy though ""The Vegas Man!"" sounds as if it could be the theme song to Bonanza 2020. Maybe DiLego can get Hoss and Little Joe to pick him up next time."
4,dilego is rockin it out,don dilego is blowing me away with this album of diverse songs from raucous rock to moody ballads..... this guy is a force....i fully expect to hear alot of talk about him very soon..... this is the type of album you can play at parties or just grooving in your convertiible on a long straight road........

5,A new fun story brings you back to Oz. Great gift!,"I bought this book because I love everything Oz, and I was NOT disappointed! This book has great illustrations to help your imagination along, and my son loved them. The brand new characters come to life and soon have you rooting for them.This is just good fun, no worries about the content or need to censor. My kids loved the talking animals. While this may be considered a ""children's"" book, there are puns and plays on words that the adult reader will enjoy. It is a most welcome addition to our Oz collection. I hope there are more on the way from this author. I am buying more copies to give as gifts."
3,The Secret Language of LUCK,"The book is fun to own and I enjoy the series in general. I also own his book ""The Secret Language of Destiny"" and both books get read often. Everyone who has picked them has gotten a kick out of reading these."
2,Didn't really work,"I had high hopes for this product as I was hoping it would take care of a pervasive problem that I've been having for a long time. Sadly, I can only report that the powder didn't work, it didn't keep monkeys away from my bottom. In fact, it just seemed to attract more monkeys."
4,Zola's notable achievement,"'Money' may be said to rank among M. Zola's notable achievements... This is not surprising, as the book deals with a subject of great interest to every civilized community. And with regard to this English version, it may, I think, be safely said that its publication is well timed, for the rottenness of our financial world has become such a crying scandal, and the inefficiency of our company laws has been so fully demonstrated, that the absolute urgency of reform can no longer be denied"
1,Nothing Lucky About This Turkey,"John Travolta and Lisa Kudrow star as two people who try to rig a lottery contest. Yawn. I'm keeping it short and simple because this movie is a failure in every department. Not to say that the cast weren't bad. The supporting cast were the best. It's nice to see Ed 'o' Neill on the silver screen, trying to shake his Al Bundy image. That's the only good thing to say about this monster dog of a movie. Avoid at all costs. You won't be lucky to see this movie. What was the usually great Nora Ephron thinking?. John Travolta, get a new agent. Totally awful. No luck comes from this stinker."
1,"Again, What Was Travolta Thinking?","Strike two for Travolta. After failing miserably with Battlefield Earth, the now desperate actor tries out Lucky Numbers. It is about a local weatherman that has to declare bankrupcy and then devises a scheme to win the lottery. The film co-stars Lisa Kudrow, Tim Roth, and Ed O'Neil. The movie just doesn't cut it. Usually Nora Ephron (You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, and Hanging Up) gives her audiences a fun romantic comedy that gives us a few laughs. This one on the other hand gives us no laughs and I actually turned it off half way through. I can't believe some of the movies that Hollywood makes anymore. Avoid at all costs."
2,Same old story......with a weak twist,"Disappointment. That sums up this movie. I went into this one with little expectations and it couldn't even meet those. The plot was ridiculously simple and the acting was incredibly bland. The overall premise of a guy down on his luck who resorts to a criminal undertaking and then halfway through the movie realizes he's in over his head has been used and abused. Two thumbs down to Travolta for taking the role. He acted great, but the movie as a whole just wasn't that good. Sorry, 2 stars"
1,A mega disapointment,This movie was simply the one of the worst movies I have ever seen.I was expecting a funny dark comedy and what I got was a major let down.I sat there and only laughed at one scene and that was it.I don't even know why such talented actors like John Travolta and Lisa Kudrow chose this movie.It is simply horrible.A must avoid.
5,A Thousand Laughs,"Slightly vulgar, but apparently one of the best comedies America has ever seen since ""Hot Shots"" I reccomend this movie to anyone thirteen and above. It's got a great cast - Colin Mocrie, John Travolta, Lisa Kudrow, who else do you need? Trust me - you gotta see it to believe it!"
3,Good information,"I was so elated to find this book. But it is a copy of the book first printed in 1775, rather than a reprinting.This means the font is difficult to read. An 's' looks like an 'f' and so on. But the information it conveys is(for me) so valuable as to override the difficulty in reading it."
2,Not for my dog with copper storage syndrome,I purchased this product because it advertised that it contained zinc and it does. My dog is on zinc maintainance because he has copper storage disease. When I read the ingredients I found an ingredient that would be harmful to him. The packages were never opened and returned with no questions asked. The delivery was fast and the customer service was courteous. I only give it 2 stars because I never used the product.
5,Great for oily skin,"I use this in the morning to clean my dry/oily/sensitive/acne prone skin and it is great! It can be drying, so if you have super oily skin then you'll want to try this product! My acne has improved by adding this to my skin care routine (which is extensive)."
2,From Decent to Bad,"I found the first half of Grave's book enjoying and convincing in using scientific analysis to make his point that race doesn't really exist in humans. He then takes that premise and goes nowhere with it while describing the ills of the myth. The scientific part of his reasoning wanes as he goes more and more into the socio-political aspects of our society.Credibility turned to incredibility as his pick and choose logic and statistics became more prevalent. He complains that before present day affirmative action, whites had it, but it was called something else and criticizes it. Fine, but he then goes on to support affirmative action. After convincing me that race is a myth, he himself subsequently claims that churches are ""racially segregated"". I would have appreciated more on solutions than beratement of well known inequalities.But who is to say, it may be that the 4 enlightning statements that I got out of the entire last half of the book may end up being worthwhile."
2,Science and Tunnel Vision Too.,"Fast, easy, not-too-techincal read.The Title is misleading. The book is about race. It is a political screed the basis of which is that racial differences in the U.S. are cultural and not genetic.The author presents scientific evidence that there is little racial difference in DNA from one race to another to show that all races have more in common than they have differences.The book moves from science to an attack on Europeans. According to Graves, Europeans are subjugators of others. Those Anglo-Saxon males seem to be the worst! Graves conveniently forgets some non-Europeans who have not done too poorly when it comes to subjugation: Ghenghis Kahn, Mao Tse Dong, Hirohito, and Pol Pot come immediately to mind. Even some Africans have done their part: Idi Amin, Sani Abacha, Samuel Doe, Charles Taylor and Zimbabwe's own Robert Mugabe, who is now ""cleaning out the trash."""
2,What about the rest of the world?,"If race is a hoax, it has taken in all people of every recorded epoch, from Herodotus down to ourselves. It is not simply America, nor is it recent. A focus on our society in our century is far too myopic.Graves has drawn on good sources. He has drawn somewhat different conclusions than writers whom he cites, such as Cavalli-Sforza. His book would be better if the bibliography were better ordered. Along with Cavalli-Sforza he might have mentioned Spencer Wells' ""The Journey of man.""The book is flawed by a number of non sequiturs. Graves develops towards a point in a logical sequence of ironclad and well supported steps, then ventures one step beyond into thin air with no support whatsoever. Often it involves jumps among realms, as from genetics to politics to sociology to history."
2,Same as the rest...,"This book is pretty much the same as the rest, only more amateurishly done in many ways. The rpint is big, it sort of looks like it was self-printed, and it has little research to back up what it says. It offers idyllic, utopian notions of what teaching ""should"" be. It doesn't ground itself in the real world, and the only saving grace is that the author admits that many of his ideas are more ideal than realistic. He occasionally uses phrases like ""I would be willing to bet..."", as if somehow making guesses based on personal preferences counts as quality educational theory. There's nothing new offered by this book; it's the same issues being rehashed by another author. It's not that the ideas are bad, it's just that there's nothing here that will surprise any teacher with more than a week's worth of experience."
2,Redundant and too idealistic blah blah blah,"If you're an education student or already a teacher this book is mildly inspiring, however it does not offer anything you haven't already heard or read. Most advice is practical and common sense i.e. ""form relationships with your students"" ""don't yell or demean them"" ""make it 'cool to care'""There are many more books out there with more substance. The bulk of the author's career is as a school principal (he only taught for a couple years) so the text is written from an administrator's point of view, therefore there are idealistic philosophies and it lacks applicable classroom strategies or solid case scenarios. I do not recommend this book. Although a short read, it is mostly fluff."
1,An appalling book for teachers,"I was hoping to get some great ideas; however, it was full of BS from an administrator. I was very appalled at some of the ideas, suggestions, and personal scenarios. I did not like how he stereotyped teachers as good and bad. He also bragged about himself a lot.I would recommend a title change ""What your principle thinks great teachers are (to make their life easier)"""
1,Tell Me Something That I Don't Know,"This book starts off telling the reader that every teacher has a classroom to manage. That is about as insightful as it gets. When I take the time to read a book assigned to me by my school, I'd like it to say something to me about how I can really address my students' needs better. This collection of ""motivational"" anecdotes serves simply to reenforce the idea that teaching is an anti-intellectual profession. I don't need to be told that I need to respect the students and the families that I work with, thank you. Perhaps my expectations from my profession and from myself are higher than those of Mr. Whitaker."
3,What Great Teachers Do Differently,"This book was good, except that it is pretty much exactly like ""What Great Principals Do Differently"" I wish I had read a review about it prior to buying BOTH of them..A good read for teachers."
1,Book study report,"Our faculty formed groups to do a book study of several professional titles. As a veteran teacher I wanted to brush up on any current trends and rejuvenate my midyear enthusiasm. We have only 2 chapters left, and we are still waiting for some real insight from this author. We have found this book to be repetitive and to offer no real suggestions. There is a lot of common sense in this book and some good guidelines regarding ethics and professional standards. However, a new teacher looking for specifics on how to become a ""great teacher"" will be disappointed."
5,What Great Teachers Do Differently: Fourteen Things that Matter Most,"What a fabulous book to use as a book study with teachers of all levels and experiences! It is a quick-read with ideas that can be implemented as soon as the chapter is done being read. The book lends itself to deep, thought-provoking conversation between staff members whether you are a first year teacher or a ""well-seasoned"" teacher. Teachers don't want to put the book down once they start reading it. Whitaker draws his readers in by consistently talking about ""great"" teachers and the effective practices they use. A ""must read"" for every educator!"
5,What Great Teacher Do Differently,"This book is phenomenal for future educators. While the content is common sense, it is things that teachers often forget. Through reading this book, I have a better idea of things to do and not to do as a teacher. Every point that Whitaker makes is backed up by a real life event that he witnessed first hand. This truly is a sensational book that I will keep on hand throughout my many years of teaching!"
4,Used books,"The book was shipped really fast, was in a bit better shape than I expected, given its age."
1,Fake version of Mr. Scarface,This version of the movie was recorded onto DVD from a very worn-out VHS tape. There were several places where the person pushed buttons inadvertently or adjusted tracking. The cover shows a female who is not present in the film itself. It's really very silly.
1,"I like Jack Palance a lot, But this movie was no good","A gangster is killed by a rival mobster [Jack Palance]. Years later, His son goes looking for the man that killed his father. This movie was no good. Acting is bad, The action is boring, The fight scenes are very bad, And the story is just too predictable. This italian gangster movie doesn't even deserve to have a talented actor like Jack Palance as its star. This movie isn't worth owning, Even if it is now a bargain title. Hope the review helped. I'm out"
1,Faded picture + Childish acting + Ridiculous plot,- The picture is faded.- The acting is stiff and childish.- The plot is ridiculous.- Jack Palance is good in other movies made in the 90's not this which was made in the 70's.- It's a huge waste of my money.- I will never buy action films made in the 70's again.
5,THE BEST EVENING OF MY LIFE!!!!!!,"This was just great. Here we have the only time this great singers (the best for me) sang Rigoletto, La Taviata and Lucia at the Met, and was released on video. This is the only time you'll see Joan as Violeta on video!!!!!!!!!!!! Do I have to say something else??? It's a great performance, both look great. I adore it!!! Get it if you can."
5,audubon's best single collection,"to be read wholly as occasional readings and very enjoyable; allows one to imagine the bird life and other wildlife in America in the days of exploration and settlement, and how much of nature we have lost."
4,Pres and Bird influences meet at swing/bop crossroads,"This is where it all started for Wardell. He's heard here with the big band of Earl Hines and in extremely hard-to-find sessions with bassist Vernon Alley and Joe Swanson.On the Hines sides, Wardell's swinging right out of the gate, but he's only one of many on these dates - check out Kermit Scott, Cliff Smalls, Scoops Carry and, of course, Hines himself.With Vernon Alley, the harmonies advance. The first Swanson side sets a furious tempo over a driving band arrangement - classic Wardell. Things cool down briefly, but never bore.Given the dates of these recordings and the poor sound quality on original pressings (ARA and Trilon), I was pleasantly surprised by the clarity. Only fourteen more volumes to go!Thanks Coover (producer). Rest in peace, my friend."
2,"Very thin, almost see through","I ordered this to go running in mild weather, brrrr, the fabric is paper thin, almost see through, I kept it but will not run in the cold wearing this shirt. Very boxy cut, too short in the length."
4,Lost Gold Cargo,In this enthrawling adventure the Hardy Boys take on a group of hard nosed gold thieves. They go all over central and south america looking for clues. They also get involved in a silver stealing mystery. This mystery is just another one of the brillant Hardy Boy mysteries we have grown to love.
5,A map that everyone can understand,"OK look. Kodansha maps are the best. The problem is that when you go to Japan, you find what you want on a map and then ask a Japanese person to help you. Since the Kodanshas have English and Kanji, they quickly understand what you are talking about. Also, the little guide that tells you the location of major cities and features by grid is awesome. I also recommend the Tokyo and other maps."
2,Muffled Sound,"The Chandos Hickox Vaughan Williams cycle is one the best available. The performances and the recording quality are excellent. Most would rate 5+ stars.This recording is a mastered at such a low volume, I would tend to believe that there has been some kind of mistake. You really need to crank up the amps in order to hear much of the performance. This even applies to some passages that are not even supposed to be quiet. I have listened to both the SACD and CD layers on state of the art equipment and find the sound level to be inferior for both formats."
3,Family movies,"This trilogy has a good plot, and expresses good family values. The only downfall is that the family isn't very wilderness smart even after months or a year in the wilderness. Still, I give it 3 stars for showing that life can be simpler yet just as fulfilling without TV, Computers, credit cards and all that jazz."
5,just as i remembered...,"I watched these as a child and wanted my children to see them as well. The acting isn't superb but the stories are kind-hearted and, at times, action packed. The idea of living off the land and encountering all that it brings was enjoyable to my children."
2,too cute and cuddly........,"This film, although it is a good wholesome film, is not very realistic. Anyone who knows the outdoors well, knows that most of the wild animals in this film would never act the way they do (especially the bear, Samson), and that most of the sequences would not transpire in that fashion. This is a glorified, sugar coated, rose colored portrayal of nature, not at all accurate of the actual rough, rugged, sometimes cruel way that nature actually is. It is a nice dream, but it is not reality."
4,A family classic,"An eco-friendly husband (Robert Logan) and wife (Susan Damante-Shaw) move their family from the city to a remote cabin in the wilderness where they encounter a variety of forest wildlife, including harmless deer and harmful bears. There are some hair-raising fight scenes between the faithful family dog and a bristling bruin. The Further Adventures of the Wilderness Family followed in 1978.Staci Layne Wilson"
4,good wholesome movie,"Hi, really great movie. I enjoyed it. I loved seeing all the animals and the setting is so picturesque. Some pretty scary animal fight scenes, may not be appropriate for children <12. In my opinion."
3,Good family story,"Togetherness in a family is essential, and that is the main lesson of this story. Some of the scenes were not as believable, but still made a FANTASTIC story."
4,Great family movie,"My whole family loved this movie. There was lots of excitement and funny scenes. Really kept my boys (ages 4 & 7) spellbound. Our school showed this movie to the PreK-4, Kindergarten, and First Graders one rainy afternoon during recess and they all loved it."
4,I loved it as a kid...so I bought it for mine!!,"""We are a wilderness family..."" Ever since the first time I watched this movie as a kid I have wanted to move to the mountains and live off of the land!!This movie is a good wholesome family movie. It was filmed in the late 70's/early 80's and you can really tell. Plus, the acting gets pretty stiff in numerous places and some of the story lines are a bit forced. BUT...it is still fun to watch all these years later.I have gotten so tired of all the junk that is out there for kids (???) these days so when my girls aren't watching PBS I like for them to watch videos instead. This is one that stresses family values like love and team work. There is no ""potty humor"", no cartoon characters, and the language in entirely appropriate for everyone in the family.GREAT movie if you want to limit your kids exposure to junkfood for the brain."
5,one of the greatest family films out there,"This is one of the greatest family films out there, folks! My brothers and I grew up watching this series and my boys will grow up watching them as well. Action, adventure, family and fun. And all without a swear word or the slightest flash of nudity! Who knew that stuff like this could really sell?Gather your family together, pop a bowl of popcorn, and enjoy the Adventures of the Winderness Family!"
3,The Wildreness family is one Bear of a movie!,"The Wilderness Family is a movie that makes me think of an American Swiss family Robinson type movie. It's a story about a family learning to survive outside the realms of normal life. We see them struggle and we see them survive.This is a movie that while it's like the Swiss Family Robinson, its not completly like them. The movie is about half as good but for children and families struggling in our current world trying to find good family entertainment, it is good enough.The cinematography is sub par, and the acting is pretty good, but the scenery and the animals are really cool.So I say if you you don't have the disney version of the Swiss family Robinson buy that instead, but if you already have it and want some good family entertainment, pick this up, you won't beat the price, and it really was enjoyable"
5,Brought back great memories,I watched this movie as a kid and was so thrilled to see it available in the trilogy. The movie is great at reinforcing the value of family.
1,Doesn't pass Caller ID!?,"These were completely useless for me as I bought them for the specific purpose of getting caller ID to a remote location and they don't pass the caller ID info thru! (The DirecTV receiver will display caller ID on the TV screen - great if there is someone with hearing problems in the house) These jacks are advertised to work as a slow modem, what's so hard about passing a little caller ID info thru? Neither the Amazon product description or the packaging gets around to mentioning that caller ID is inop with these devices, you only find it buried in the pamphlet fine print after the struggle to open the plastic encapsulation. Maybe I should have done more research before buying, but I feel cheated."
1,Does not Work,"Attempted multiple times to install, eventually evein the same room. Each time, at the receiving telephone instrument all you heard was a beep and some loud static, then nothing. I ended up ordering a hard-wired jack from the telephone company. The only redeeming quality is the customer service from the seller was exceptional. They refunded with no question."
5,It Works,"Bought this used at a Habitat for Humanity ReStore and put it away for years. It is yellowed and the lights don't light up.But during a remodel I had to remove a phone jack that was in the way. This meant I had to relocate my fax machine. In the next room there was an unused old phone jack, unused because the quality of the phone signal connected to it was very weak. I tried plugging in the RCA Wireless Phone Jack base unit, got a dial tone right away and I can run my fax machine, phones or anything off it."
4,Works well after setup,The phone jack works as advertised. It was a bit fickle about making the initial connection. I had to reset the unit and try a second time.
1,Very disappointed,"RCA RC930 Caller-ID-Compatible Wireless Modem JackI purchased the RCA 926 and had the RC930 substituted. I had hoped this would solve my problem with a lack of phone line for my satellite. However, I was greatly disappointed when none of my phone calls came through (they were all routed to my voicemail) and when I tried to make a phone call, I noticed there was a repetitive beep on the line as the base would transmit to the remote unit. I sent it right back at my expense, thus losing the $6 in return shipping and the $11 in initial shipping and handling. What a waste of money!"
3,It works pretty good.,"The setup was pretty easy. I plugged everything in and it worked - or so I thought. I use this with my Dish Network reveiver. It shows that the phone line is connected but will not dial out to order pay-per-view. That dissapoints me a little. I guess it is possible that it is user error, but I can't find any other instructions on how to corrrect the problem."
2,Not as advertised,"I was excited to try this product for my DirecTV DVR connection without having to install another phone jack. Simply put, it didn't work. Then when I tried to use it for a regular phone (both cordless and corded), there was so much static that you couldn't have a conversation. I was very disappointed. It appeared, for me, this product was too good to be true."
3,Wireless Phone Jack,"With RCA RC926 the telephone system, including VoIP adapters, sound/voice will transmit acceptably via the electric wiring, but it filtered out the caller ID."
1,"Just doesn't work, had to return","This is only the 2nd item I have returned in 6-8 yrs of buying on Amazon. It just doesn't work well enough to keep.You can make an outgoing call on it, but it will not ring for an incoming call. No Caller ID, no ring, no nothing. Outgoing call sound quality is terrible--static and clicking noises. I tried several different jacks, outlets and locations. I wanted to make sure the units weren't too close, nor too far from each other. Tried different jacks, plugs, etc. Made sure it was plugged directly into an outlet.Nothing made any difference. Outgoing call quality was poor, incoming would NEVER work nor ring. Returned item."
4,wireless phone jack,"The jack worked reasonably well as described. I had occasional problems with losing the connectivity on one of my phone outlets. However, I later discovered that this might have been related to a faulty modem that the was connected to the phone line."
2,Works good for phones but not for modems,"The advertising for the RCA RC926 is deceptive. While it is described as a wireless modem jack, only after one opens the package and looks at the documentation does one discover that the modem speed is limited to 14,400 baud and more usually 9600 baud. That was slow even 5 years ago; now it is virtually useless when most modems operate at 33600 or 56000 baud"
2,"OK, not great","I connected a phone on the extension. Connection is stable (i.e., didn't lose connection during a phone call), but the sound quality is not good. For whatever reason, I HEAR MY OWN VOICE SO LOUD (I tried with several phone sets that work perfectly at ordinary outlets) that I can't carry on a conversation more than a few mins. I just answer there and quickly switch to another phone. I would not recommend it if you plan to use it for a serious cause."
2,"For voice or fax only, not for modems","If you need to add a phone extension without cables or need to hook up a fax machine this product is ok, but for modems and internet connections, your speed will go dooooooown to 9600 or even less."
1,RCA RC926 Wireless Phone Jack,"This may be a good product, I don't know, because I brought used ones and they did not work. I will be buying new from now on."
1,No fax,"Despite several attempts (including changing locations) I was unable to get a strong enough dial tone for my fax.I have seen that a real wireless 2.4 mgh phone extension system is available in Europe but not in the US, where I only find powerline systems."
1,Would not function properly,"I purchased this to add a phone line to the 2nd floor of my house (which does not have a phone jack) - simply adding a traditional phone line, no VOIP, no TIVO, nothing fancy. We have DSL, so I used the 2Wire filters and tried every phone jack in the house for the base. Some had a clearer connection than others, but with every attempt, after 5 seconds to 60 seconds, the line would disconnect and the remote phone was left with no connection. I reset the units, followed all troubleshooting options, and still had the same problem.I returned this unit - I don't know if this was an individual defect, or another symptom of a faulty product, but based on the negative reviews, I won't be ordering another to find out."
1,Too much noise,"I bought this item to add a phone jack for my Dish Network DVR. The house I just moved into does not have a jack anywhere near the DVR, and I don't have the ability to install one.Setup was very quick, and I thought things were going to be good, but after about 30 seconds on a voice call, I found that this unit causes a lot of noise on the other phones in the house that are not connected to it.Very disappointed with it."
4,GREAT WIRELESS PHONE JACK,This wireless phone jack works great for what we needed. Need one for our DVR receiver with the dish company.
3,RCA RC926 Wireless Phone Jack,"I needed this jack to connect my Dish Network DVD tivo recorder. The jack worked somewhat but it does not work with caller ID, one of the main reasons I purchased this item. I did not find this out till I opened the box and read the insturctions because this was not disclosed any where on the package or in the advertisements for it. The advertisement just gave seveal things it did work with and added that it worked with many more. Because most phone Items work with this we assumed it also would. We did return the Item."
3,I could not get it to work.,I have several surge protectors on my electrical cicuits. This may have been the problem. I did not want to remove the surge protectors.
4,It just plain works,"I'm using it for my Dish Network box, and it works great - no interference with my WiFi or my wireless phone. I would have given it 5 stars but the boxes are a little cumbersome."
1,RCA RC926 Wireless Phone Jack,"This thing is awful. Not only did it not work, when trying to call technical support, I can't get through. I tried submitting via email my issues, get no response. I can't get a phone number that will get to a real person. I would not purchase this product ever again."
2,Quit working within a week.,"I installed this product and tried several A/C outlets,but the phone always produced backgound hiss and static.Within a week it quit working and I could not get the transmitter light to come on after that so returned the unit for a refund. I got a different brand that does not have the background noise. I hope it lasts."
1,A piece of junk,Didn't work and caused static in the existing phone line. I bought this to get my dish network box connected to a phone line. Needless to say; I am still paying the monthly service fee and now have a useless piece of junk in my closet.
1,Wireless Phone Jack,"Got it for my computer, didn't work, wouldn't connect. Got dial tone, ring and then static and message that model could not connect. May be good for other uses."
2,Phone over powerline,"Nowhere in the product description does it say that this device will only work over the same phase of power lines. If the same phase is not available in both locations that you wish to connect, forget it."
2,Only good for a basic line,Don't waste your money if you expect full functioning line. Does not transfer caller-ID data. Probably OK for a basic extension.
1,worst purchase ever,I have not been able to get this product to work correctly since I received it. I have followed every troubleshooting hint that it came with but no luck. I am usually very good with electronics so I do not recomend this item to anyone!!!!
2,Doesn't work with DSL,"I purchased this product to connect my TIVO without having to install a second phone line. The installation was pretty simple, but when I plugged in a simple telephone set to test the line at the site where my TIVO was, the line noise was significant. When I plugged in the phone cord to my TIVO and tried to connect, the connection failed. I then contacted customer service to figure out what was wrong, and after troubleshooting the service attendent asked me if I had DSL on the line. I told her yes, and she informed me that the excessive noise on the line was due to the DSL. The wireless jack will not work with a DSL line! I was stunned! Why is there is no mention of this on the packaging or documentation?!?!? It looks like time to make a service call to the dreaded phone company to install a phone jack. Bad product, and bad documentation."
2,Doesnt work w/wireless phone,"Used a Panasonic 2.4Ghz phones as the extension and it would not get a dial tone. Plugged in a simple corded phone and it worked just fine.So, beware, the operation of the unit is uncertain."
1,Useless with a Tivo,"The unit was 20ft from the receiver, in the same room, in direct view of eachother...Tivo wouldn't connect."
3,More personality and less soul,"Frank's book is interesting, insightful and even helpful for those who find their vocation in the church. However, the title of his work is very misleading. Rather than writing about the soul of the congregation, he spends his energy discussing a congregation's history and personality...which is still helpful, but not a discussion of the soul. For those looking for a book to dig more deeply into what makes their local churches tick, this volume will provide a good resource. However, those seeking a discussion of the corporate soul (as in Acts 4) should look elsewhere."
4,Heres to Future Days,This CD is the best work by the Thompson Twins in my opinion but the one track that is missing Rollover really took away from this CD. I would love to get a copy with that cut on it. If anyone has info on how to get it please post it on this site
4,Here's to Future Days TT,"If you liked Thompson Twins and don't have Here's to Future Days and the 12"" singles, then this item would be a good buy."
5,Twins Smack attack added bonuses.,"Fantastic bonus album, been waiting along time for these 12"" original mixes esp the Smack attack mix of Doctor dream, The origial album is still a classic in my mind Its just the way i remember it agaisnt my original vinyl bonus i got with the album. Over 2hrs of Thompson Twins. If your a long lost fan you'll love it all."
3,A short review of this book,I bought this book a good while back ... but found that I really don't use it to make trading decisions. But it contains interesting concepts and makes for interesting reading. And while I don't use its material in any specific or explicit way ... I think the ideas have value and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to consider the perspectives it presents. I would recommend it in this way ... but I wouldn't recommend it as a truly viable explicit trading method ... I think there are many other better ways to make trading decisions.
3,"Great Concepts, But difficult to implement","If you have extensive programming skills, then this book makes a lot of sense. But if you are looking for an opportunity to learn to observe price and volume behavior and make decisions based on what you see on the chart in front of you, then the utility is limited. To benefit, a trading platform with significant analytical capabilities is required. Not for newer traders or investors trying to get an easy-to-implement edge."
3,Interesting but don't expect code,"After reading the book, I have mixed feelings; this may be a brilliant new concept or a mathematical gimmick. What I can say is that this book comes with no software code. That costs considerable more. If you use Tradestation and can't code the concepts from the book yourself, your next book should be Professional Stock Trading by Mark Conway and Aaron Behle. They have a chapter on Float Trading with their adaptation of the Float Box, Float Channel, and Float Percentage. Also included is a trading system based on these concepts."
2,This book was a disappointment to me.,"I think the book was well-written, but it was negative and resentful in its content. I never finished reading it."
1,Plainly poor for the most part,"I enjoyed very few of these poems. The most frustrating part about this book is that some pieces were AMAZING, but then I would feel cheated that most that followed was contrived dreck. ""Incursions, Excursions"" and ""Memo"" were phenomenal. Those two were the best."
3,Half great!,"This is a half great DVD. Why half great? Because the first six videos are a perfect example of the style of the New Romantic period. The other six videos were like a travelogue of exotic places, which do not fit with the context of the music. The quality of the dvd is fantastic."
2,It's entertaining the first time you play it.,The first time you play this game it's cool because the settlers go around doing the work automatically and you build what looks like real life functioning economy. But you find out quick the game is just a matter of repeating yourself over and over again.
1,Not fun,"This game was difficult to play. There is a learning curve. In the end, not happy with it.Not good, not bad. Meh!"
4,Fascinating,"There seems to be so very much going on at once, that you almost can't keep up with it all. Graphics, sound, and gameplay are what people come to expect out of UBI software. And this title doesn't disappoint at all. I would recommend this addition to anyone's game library."
2,Gorgeous but repetitive.,"So I got this game cheap at Half Price Books, and about halfway through the campaign I realized why. While the graphics are gorgeous on a good machine and overall the storyline quests keep things moving along nicely, you come to realize that every scenario has you building the same city, over and over, the only difference being building placement. While some scenarios are more interesting in that resources are difficult to get to, you essentially complete the same task over and over, and the ""random map"" type scenarios are even worse. Overall, not worth the money unless you enjoy mind-numbing games with a pretty facade."
1,Terrible Game,"This game sucks. It's choppy, graphics are mediocre, story line is terrible, and the game play is abysmal. The idea is good, but that's about where it begins and ends."
2,Spend your money on Civ IV,"The Settlers: Rise of an Empire is easily one the worst games I've ever played. The graphics are nice, but that's all I can say good about it. The game play is horribly boring, and the ""strategy"" element is non-existent and the game is riddled with bugs and bad design choices (even with the latest patch). The military aspect should not even have been included or they should have done a much better job of designing it before releasing it.There is absolutely NO challenge in this game. If you are a fan of 4X games or even RTS games, you will always beat the computer after about two games without even really trying. This game is terrible. Save your hard-earned money and buy something else. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for the graphics."
1,securom,"This Game comes with the ""copy-protection"" securom. securom is a destructive root kit which will corrupt many of the Games you have payed hard earned Money for. Although I think Rise of an Empire is a perfectly fine game, the fact that it is designed to become unplayable overtime makes it not worth your Money. This is my opinion."
1,Reply to the reviewer below me:,"The reviewer below me was WRONG! Barbie has been around for 43 years and she has more stuff. Also, Barbie beats Bratz. Bratz are no match for Barbie.BARBIE DECLARES VICTORY!"
5,A gem and worthwhile for journalists and history buffs,"Max Frankel conveys both personal insights and moving descriptions in his story that spans his escape from Nazi Germany to his reign as top dog at America's most influential newspaper. With gripping insight, clear writing and a passion for accurate, ethical journalism, Frankle weaves a tale that is hard to put down. A true page-turner that makes you think, told with self-depricating honesty any journalist would be proud to emulate."
2,Snooooozer,"I didn't finish this book because I quickly grew weary of it. It's too bad too, because I was so looking forward to reading it. (I had it reserved from the public library weeks before it was in).I found it dry and unentertaining. With all the memoirs out there these days, this one didn't spark an interest in me, and I'm in the newspaper business. There are a lot better ones out there."
4,"Wonderful, wonderful book","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As an avid reader of the New York Times, it provided a fantastic behind-the-scenes look at how some of the major events of the 20th Century were captured and recorded in the ""Newspaper of record."" Not only was it a fabulous account of NYT, Max Frankel's personal account of his life read like a novel--I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. If you appreciate current events, the media, and history--you'll love this book."
5,An inspiring and thoughtful account,"Mr. Frankel focuses his keen journalist's eye on himself and his work, producing a fascinating account of his own life, the evolution of journalism, and recent history. His vision for society, and the journalist's role in it, makes this book a must-read for any informed citizen in a liberal democracy. His perspective on events, honed by years at The Times, is amazing."
1,Not worth the investment,Very disappointing about the book. The description was not clear about the year of publication. This book is so outdated I guess that's why it was not expensive. I was looking for updated info about assessments and many of the assessments in the book has had several revisions since this book was published.
2,Could have been a made for TV movie. Very Average.,"It started out with so much promise. It's the Mc Carthy era & paranoia rules. Kelly McGillis gets caught up in it & loses her job. With time on her hands she stumbles onto what becomes a plot to smuggle Nazi into the country. Meanwhile she is being harassed by The FBI. Agent Jeff Daniels gets friendly & she enlist him into what she has discovered. He helps her in his spare time & falls for her(who wouldn't). Mandy Patinkin is pleasently evil. There is a gratuitous shot of Kelly's breasts while she is in the shower. Maybe the high point of the movie. Actually she pulls off being a career woman of the 50's very well. Lots of slow spots, & a silly chase in the rafters of Grand Central Station. It's only 101 minute longer but seemed longer. Maybe I can squeeze 21/2 stars."
1,Disappointing,"I agree with the Leonard Maltin review. This starts off well, but becomes a very ordinary, unexciting melodrama, that tries to have some Hitchcock tension, but it doesn't work very well. Towards the end of the film, I was muttering, ""what a waste of time.""The reviewer Peter(can't remember the rest of his or her name) should have his or her review REMOVED, for revealing too much of the plot of the film. I'd write to Peter, if there were an e-mail address. Do NOT reveal too much about plot details. It's nice to be surprised when you see a film, Peter."
3,House on Carroll Street,"Good thriller. No way compares to ""House on 92nd Street"". Format is different. ""House on Carroll Street"" is a movie, while ""House on 92nd Street"" is a documentary intertwined into a movie...very interesting approach. For simple entertaining, I recommend it. However, it's contingent on the audience's viewpoint."
2,Disappointment,"Watched this DVD several times and lost track of the plot. Actually,I bought it because of the final scenes in Grand Central Terminal showing areas which are not open to the public."
4,Works fine for me with hard water,"I purchased the Paragon handheld shower filter almost a year ago and it has works just fine for me thought I live in Orange County, CA and the water is very hard. I have noticed a significant reduction in chlorine levels and have just purchased replacement filters to continue its use. Maybe it doesn't work for everybody but I've been happy with the water pressure, massaging options, look of item, ease of install and fair price."
1,Painfully boring,"This is a generic boring movie with some guy who thinks he is the London version of Colombo. I got so bored with it that I skimmed, and skimmed, and skimmed, and skimmed...etc...etc NOTHING HAPPENS. This is pathetic. They should have called this movie ""the day in the life of a dork"" since the movie has what I call a slew of ""time killer scenes"" for example: we have time enough to watch this guy sleep, then time enough to watch him take a very long shower. Time enough to watch a girl dance. Time enough to watch him shower again. Then time to watch him take a long walk down a city sidewalk. This movie stinks, that's all there is to it. The definition of H E L L is being strapped to a chair for an eternity to watch this garbage over and over again. Anyone that would give this more than 3 stars either lives under a rock, or is in someway connected to the making of this movie"
1,"It isn't the film, it's the script","I don't like movies that act as if they'll make you think but then turn out to be lousy stories badly told smothered in pretentious film school non-linear narrative Crapola. Just because it is impressive for something made so cheaply doesn't mean it's actually worth watching if you want to see an actually well-made movie. It is creepy, but I had guessed the whole stupid plot by 10 minutes in. So all the crazy flashbacks were just annoying to me, & not as confusing and ridiculous as they were for my friend.I LOVE indie film when it doesn't stink. I hated this movie."
4,"Great Glasses, terrible case",This is the third pair of these same glasses that we have purchased in the last 2 years (one pair was lost). They are crazy cool. We wore them on a cruise and were awed by how they cut sun glare on the ocean. The thin glass lenses are top notch and the whole pair is very light and easy to wear for long periods. This product would rate an unconditional 5 stars if not for the case. All 3 have been exactly the same - the threads that hold the zipper in place unravel constantly causing the zipper to get stuck at any place along the length. Constant trimming and zipper wax help but sunglasses in this price range should come with a decent case. One of the original cases lasted about 3 weeks until the zipper head just came off the zipper altogether. And it would be a good case if not for the shoddily made zipper. Great glasses from Italy; junky case from China.
2,No good,"The basic idea is clever enough, but that's about the best I can say for it. The plot is far too easy - any kind of rhyme works exactly what the guy wanted to happen, except in one case, when the oversight he made *helped* him. Convenient, eh? Then there's the cheesy and poorly developed romance subplot. If you could suspend disbelief to ignore all the easy solutions and plot oversights, the book would be interesting enough, but I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone who likes *real* fantasy novels."
5,Wow,"What I can say about this book? If u like heroic fantasy, comedy and romance... well, this is the best book ever! U can't have so much fun in any other fantasy book, that's sure! I want a movieeeeee !!!!!!!"
4,"Clever, very very clever","Stasheff became an instant addition to my library with ""Her Majesty's Wizard"". His weave of fantasy and 20th century science immediatly entangled me, a college physics student. I found myself reading only to find out what Stasheff would pull out of his hat or what wild character he would introduce next. If you are a student of science, please read this book! It will make you a believer in the power of fantasy literature. To all you fantasy lovers out there - insooth a worthy read indeed! The only fault I find in the book (and the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5) is due to the level of the book. I felt that Stasheff developed the characters and kept the overall flow of the book very ""popcorn and candy"". Moreover, the character development could have been deeper and the storyline less cheery. Aside from that aspect, a truly pleasant find!"
5,Rock!,"This story along with Phyllis Eisenstein's are some of my older favorites. I can't remember how I found this book but I am SO pleased that I did. (I guess you find a lot of the lesser knowns when you work in a bookstore for two years) If you haven't read this or Phyllis Eisenstein's ""The Crystal Palace"" or ""Sorcerer's Son"", please do."
5,A sad but happy ending to the series,"I liked this book, as it still surprises you - nothing goes smoothly in Amy's life, does it? When Fanfare arrives at Heartland no-one tells Amy his problem, so she accidently makes it worse and causes an accident that gives her concussion and dredges up all the painful memories of her mothers death.Amy is also in 2 minds as to go to college after all, but Ty helps her along. He and Amy get very romantic towards the end, before she leaves.Amy also falls out with Joni! That made me smile, as Joni is usually so perfect it gets on my nerves. Amy is a much better horse healer than her.If you want to get all the details, buy the book. It really is a perfect ending."
4,Havent Read,Its true that there might be a 21 book because i tried going to France @ the bottom of the amazon.com page and typed in Lauren Brooke and there was a 21 book!!!!!!!hopefully there is one!
5,HEARTLAND CONTINUES!,"Even though Lauren brooke has ended this awesome series, fans can continue writing for her! on fanfiction.net, they have opened a section on heartland, so people can write their own stories about heartland. We need all Heartland fans to write so that this amazing series will go on forever!"
5,A great help for a 1st year Med Student,"""Essential Cell Biology"" by Bruce Alberts literally saved my 1st semester. The course went hard and the lectures were long and boring. And then - I opened the Essential, started reading, and suddenly things got clear for me. I got an A on the test, and now I know my Cell Biology well - all thanks to this book. Strongly recommended!!!"
4,Pretty Good and Basic,This text is actually really good for beginners or as a refresher. Full of info and very detailed.
3,Cute. But not very useful,"I bought one of these mitts for myself. I knew it was cute to look at, but I wasn't sure it would be very functional.I was right.The mitt itself is pretty small (think sock puppet). But more importantly, the mitt is really thin. So it doesn't do a very good job insulating your hand. I certainly wouldn't use it to hold only cast-iron skillets while cooking, and even removing cookie sheets from the oven was nearly painful.If I had to lift a heavy casserole dish out of the oven, I'm sure I would burn myself.Bottom line: Much cuter than functional. I'd pass next time."
5,Adorable,"I bought two of these for a holiday gift exchange. They were a very popular item. I thought they were so cute, I wanted to keep them for myself!"
3,Horse Care Library Review,"This CD-ROM was geared towards a person with untermediate experience with horses. Although the disk has wonderful information about choosing the correct fence and caring for wounds, it had little to no information on daily maintenance. For instance, the disk explains that for every 10 degrees below freezing you must increase feed 10% but it gives no guidelines for how much feed or what kind of feed one should use. It said little about routine vet work such as floating teeth and vaccinations. I feel it would also have been nice had it contained advice about properly fitting tack. This CD is not for beginners and the information it contains can be found in many horsecare manuals but since it is a CD the information was easily accesible."
1,Radio Syndication,"The author would have you believe he has all the answerswhen in fact he wrote the book after being fired from hisprogram director job at a local radio station and needed to come up with a money making idea to stay afloat.I have been in broadcsting 20 plus years and have never heard of the author until a couple of years ago. In checking with radio industry colleagues no one has heard of the author. Be forewarned and cautioned, syndicated programming is VERY difficult to break into and most networks will not even consider your efforts unless you are a known quantity with a viable product.Save your money and your time, your chances of hitting the lottery are better than getting syndicated."
1,Author Please,Have 33 years in broadcasting and got the book second hand at a garage sale. If you belive what's in this book then I've got a bridge in New York you might like to purchase.
2,Scarier than it has a right to be,"As a school librarian, I naturally thought that these books would be a slam dunk, after reading this team's Fergus Crane and Corby Flood (loved both) and of course their Edge Chronicles series.I definitely disagree with the age range printed on the back of the book, listed at 7-11. Be warned that the pictures are extreme, most esp. the sword through the throat in either book two or three. Interesting to read, but subject matter rough on me, and imagine it would be on my students, as well, no matter how tough they think they might be. Not opposed to scariness overall, kids love and need scary books. I believe there is a big difference between well-written scary material and straight-up violent matter. Choosing not to enter this series in my collections."
2,disappointed,"I think this is more suited for a one year old not a 3 year old. It is too simple and basic for the older kids. But, we do love Olivia."
1,NOT WORTH IT!!!!,"This book is not worth it. It is too short with one word pages. It's cute but not worth buying. After reading other Olivia books, I was extremely disappointed when I got it in the mail."
5,Olivia is just too cute,Little ones and Adults just love these books. I like that they are heavy board books.A Must Have!!!Books make the best gift!!!
2,"If you know and love Olivia, skip it","We have several of Olivia's books and this one, is disappointingly, a cut/paste of images from those existing storybooks. There is no real language in here, just the simple opposites words and then it's literally drawings from the other books inserted to fit the words. My daughter was so excited to read but when we went through it, she (3) said ""that's it?"". I think there was disappointment that we knew the images already so well and that there was nothing fun about the words, no word play or nuances. I have a feeling this is a book the publishing house through together with little to no participation from Ian Falconer. He's too clever, as shown in his other books, to actually do this!"
3,Disappointing,"Thought there would be more opposites in this book. If a book is too short, I can't keep my daughter's attention. She loves the Oliva books, just not this one."
4,Well-made,"I just think the space between the rows doesn't need to be this wide, and the sticks themselves should've been higher to help accommodate larger plates."
3,Crooked peg,I work in an iPad and Android software developer lab and have a lot of tablets that were hard to manage on my desk. This allows me to keep them organized while connected to the charger. The first one I got had a crooked peg in the front; if this was for my kitchen I would have returned it. But it's no big deal for the lab so I'm buying another.
3,okay,"bought to aid in digestion and reduce gas, but didn't work for us like that. others may have different results."
5,A great product necessary for intestinal health.,"I prefer enteric coated so that I do not have to refrigerate and can carry some with me. The life of the probiotics is well preserved in these Vcaps. As I tend to eat plenty of sugars this really helps keep my ""good"" bacteria in balance to prevent infections. I also prefer the glass bottle as it preserves the quality of the product longer and NOW is about making quality supplements. Just make sure to take this on an empty stomach so it is more effective. If you are considering this product, I say go for it. There is no after taste or ""repeat"" as with other supplements and this goes right into the digestive tract doing its work. I also recommend the NOW Nutritional Yeast Flakes, full of B complex vitamins and excellent addition to your diet. Your body will thank you if you take good care of it!"
3,HUGE capsule!!,I really can't review this item as I wasn't able to swallow them as the capsules are HUGE! If you can swallow a VERY LARGE capsule purchase these and leave a product review. : )
1,"""Not as Gr8 as I thought it would be...""","Unfortunately, when I ingested this product it caused me a headache and stomach upset each time that I took it; bummer 8-("
5,Little Critters Help After Antibiotics,"After months of having diarrhea and IBS like symptoms following several courses of antibiotics I decided to try these because they got good reviews and didn't need to be refrigerated. All the good reviews did not stear me wrong, after only a couple of days of taking them I was having normal solid stools and felt a tremendous difference. I had already been taking plain acidophilus tablets and lactase enzyme for my lactose intolerance and neither did as much combined as these have done. I would definitely recommend these and they are the only product like this that I know of that doesn't need to be kept in the refrigerator and taken strictly on an empty stomach which is a huge convenience. I take several prescription and non-prescription medicines and I have enough trouble remembering to take things on schedule without unnecessary hassles."
4,Helps a great deal,"Ive been taking it for about 2 months now and its really helped what I now believe was/is IBS. I didnt know it untill I starting taking this and realized how much it helped.Between this and eating Activa, I feel a LOT less bloated ,Ive lost at least 5 pounds around my midsection.This is the first probiotic Ive taken. Bought some Accu-flora but it only contains about 1/8 as many bacteria which means its much weaker.Ive read reviews on some other, really expensive pro-biotics and people rave about them. Im not sure Im ready to spend 55 cents to $1 each though.I get my Gr8-Dophilus for 15 cents each including shipping when buying 2 bottles. Will probably get it a bit cheaper than that if I buy 4 or 5 at a time and I probably will next time as I dont envision not taking it anytime soon.See clubnatural on fleabay and make them an offer."
1,"Gr8-Dophilus inflames my IBS!- FOS, inulin, and dairy... Found a good one...!","GR8 probiotic agreed with me with me until I came down with IBS/lactose intolerance, after taking antibiotics. Grrr!Now GR8 causes BAD gas, and diarrhea!- It's FOS, inulin, dairy, are BAD for my IBS...!Found a GOOD inexpensive probiotic!- I switched to PB 8 Probiotic for Life ""Vegetarian"" caps/14 million daily!-No FOS, inulin, soy (hormones...!), or dairy.PB 8 120 vcapsPer Many Health websites for my IBS.../Really settles stomach/lose weight too!- I also started sipping 2tbs of ""organic unprocessed"" Apple Cider Vinegar with a big glass of water 3x daily (+ Stevia helps cover taste/no sugar). I also sip it (don't chug) ""deep"" in mouth through a straw, for teeth health...!Per mfg- I also swish/rinse my teeth thoroughly with water after using."
3,Not gluten free,"The product info on Amazon says this may contain soy - it also may contain gluten (manufacturer's website). Barley is used in the fermentation process, so this product is not safe for those with Celiac. Which is too bad, because I was looking forward to trying it."
5,Tyvek CD/DVD Sleeves with Windows and Flap,"These tyvek envelopes look very nice and the CD and DVD slide in and out very smoothly. I haven't tried to rip the tyvek envelope apart but it seems very strong and the outside flap seems to stay in place quite nicely. The window gives a good, clear view of the CD/DVD. I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend the seller and Amazon."
2,poor quality,"I thought since these were Tyvek they suppose to be more sturdy but they were very thin ,I expected some very sturdy,I ended up returning them. I don't think they were good for organizing the CDs.Not reccomended."
1,Tyvek DVD enveolpe it too thin and flimsy to serve its intended purpose.,This Tyvek DVD enveolpe it too thin and flimsy to serve its intended purpose. My purchase of this item was a total loss.
4,"A little flimsy, but great design.","The central rod is a little wobbly, so I'm concerned as to how it will hold up in strong winds, but other than that it's a stand-up umbrella. If you can get over the silly little plastic cap on the top, and the bright blue logo, then I think you'll be happy with it. The handle has a nice curve that feels right in your hand. The velcro is nice and clingy. The spring is not terribly strong, so you'll have to use your hands to pull it open (no ""ka-pow"" style opening). I also like the unscrewable cap on the top, used to empty excess water. Worth the money in my opinion."
5,"super useful, have recommended to several friends","Bought two of these a while back, and since then have recommended it to several friends.Great for making sure rainwater doesn't get into the house and over the floor/carpet... and in the car especially! One reviewer mentioned rust; in my experience this hasn't happened. Here's a tip -- once you get home just drain the water out so you don't leave it soaking inside. Don't think it's meant to hold water indefinitely! =)"
1,Misleading pictures,"I ordered this as a gift, and am very disappointed. The umbrella is not high quality, and the plastic is clear, not black as pictures. They require you to pay for return shipping which would cost almost as much as the umbrella. BEWARE!"
2,A hour's worth of fun,"Umbrella arrives at 4pm. By 6pm the cap keeping the plastic no drip cover attached has already disappeared, leaving me with a fine umbrella with an odd looking top. Not exactly what I had in mind. Seems to be a good idea but the quality leaves something to be desired."
2,Great Umbrella... If it was only the color I ordered.,"A year or so ago, I discovered the magic that is a no drip umbrella. So, this review isn't so much about the umbrella, it's about the seller. I specifically ordered a black on black no drip umbrella. What shows up? A maroon umbrella with a white cover. And it's for my boyfriend... Not very happy."
2,"Decent umbrella, but not very sturdy","It took about a month for the plastic sheathing, which comprises the ""no drip"" portion of the umbrella to completely separate from the regular umbrella portion."
3,Great straightener wrong color,This straightener is wonderful but I ordered a purple one and received a red one. Only a few dayc before Christmas I didn't have time to return it for thx correct color I purchased.
5,Great flaltiron,"Like it so much bought second one for a gift, and my friend loves it as much as I do."
3,New Colorful Season#5,It's okay. It does the job but sometimes i feel like the temp goes down. Wish it was hot all the time! then it would be GREAT!
4,"Good, but not GREAT","I gave this a 4 star because it straightens well, but I've had other straighteners that straighten and keep my hair straightened throughout the day, but this one doesn't, my hair stills go back to being wavy after half the day. But I'm not completely blaming the straightner because I.live in a humid area, so all in all its a good straightner, but I've seen better."
5,great shoes,My husbnad wears these to work everyday. He stands on concrete for 9+ hours a day and they are very comfortable. The delivery was fast and arrived even sooner than we expected.
1,Good timing when the book came out call it Lucky investing!,"Tobin's book is to be read now after the market collapse. Stuffed with made up terms ""GOD and EGOD"" for example,(GOD) standing for Game Over Dominators, the book is organized in a logical way but the stock picking method doesn't make any sense unlike Peter Lynch's seminal 1989 book, One Up on Wall Street. Let's not forget that Lynch had the billion $ Fidelity Magellan to manage. Smith only had the Journal and may be tons of other reference materials to make up for inexperience. Anyway his next book should be called ""Tsunami"""
1,Suspicious,"I am an investor who understands the bell curve and the reviews so far shape-up to be pretty skewed. I would like to invite people to be a tad bit more crtitical in their assessments of this book. Remember the old bromide: ""If it sounds too good to be true................."""
1,Biggest B.S. in the History of the Printed Word,"Incoherent, unintelligble ramblings of a former car salesman. (Indeed, check the man's true background.) The amazing thing about ChangeWave is the PR machine... tens of thousands of books purchased by that machine to make Changewave a ""best seller."" Sadly, the only gains Tobin has ever made come from the unwary consumer who bought his book and services. Credentials are non-existent... pardon me... now Tobin's a best-selling author. But read this New Economy b.s. today... if you can even get through three pages... and you'll know... there's something rotten in the state of publishing. PT. Barnum would be so proud."
1,Give me a break,Give me a break with this stuff. Please provide further insight into your credentials. What makes you a professional investor? Have you ridden the wave downwards? Please provide me with the exact calculation methodologies of your annualized returns...
2,Yet another guru!,"This book smacks of the ""Gorilla Game"", might be okay in a Bull market, but not so hot in a Bear! Bill O'Neils' book is still the tops as far as I'm concerned. Try the free web-site, before buying the book or subscribing. Paper trading the recommendations should set you straight."
1,Read it at the bookstore before deciding to buy it.,"Unfortunately I'm not qualified to review this book since I haven't read it carefully; I did manage to skim through it at the bookstore. My impression of it is that it is a big advertisement for their website; I have no idea how it's garnering all of these glowing reviews. If this review makes you go check it out first before clicking ""add to cart"" then this review will have done its job."
3,Strategies for the Future,"The book attempts to forecast the development of a technology-based economy within the next decade. It provides a roadmap for investing with every twist, turn, and curve clearly marked. The evolution of such an economy contains periods of changing waves where investors should depend on non tech stocks to give stability during the changeover. Additionally, the book pinpoints changes which may or may not be accurately portrayed. There appears to be so much rapid and furious change in almost every sector of the markets that it makes the advice given obsolete by the time you read it. The biggest success of Change Wave Investing is the system's intelligence gathering ability and its expertise in communicating that intelligence in a convincing manner. To that I would say ""Buyer Beware."""
1,Read it at the bookstore before deciding to buy it.,"This book is one big advertisement for the author's website. If only this ""review"" makes you check out the book from your local bookstore first, then it will have done its job."
4,"Courtney, you rock!!","This stuff's great! It's wonderful genuine music that comes from the heart. There's a good sense of the writer's person coming to you through her music. Courtney's a very talented Christian artist, and I can't wait for more..."
4,Spiritually inspiring debut from a talented young songwriter,"With her combination of folksy rock and thoughtful lyrics, Courtney C. Patty showcases her talents as singer/songwriter/guitarist on her first solo alblum."
1,I would estimate that 5% of this book contains useful information.,"I'm not sure what book the other reviewers were referring to. Filling pages with empty forms with ONE overly simplified example doesn't exactly prepare a budding entrepreneur to tackle their bookkeeping. In addition to the limited content, multiple typos and some grainy jpegs make me question Nova's commitment to publishing quality books."
5,Espresso-vision...(bean there seen that),"These binos have a LATTE going for them!!!Exquisite long-range sight capacity with that lingering, roasty, full-flavored rush rarely associated with birdwatching. Truly a must-have device for all outdoors activities (including stalking)that may also require caffeination. I did scald myself once or twice but if you use the (suggested) titanium based retinal pre-wash you should be good to go!"
5,Seeing is believing.,Be careful cleaning the eyepiece as pushing hard will dislodge some poorly glued ones. These are awesome binoculars as they are very light(this is very important if you have to hold them up very long)and really bring things into view.
4,Move over Tom Clancy and make room for Trevor Scott,"Jake Adams is well on his way to becoming the next American hero. He's smart, mysterious and witty. If you like reading Tom Clancy's books, you'll love this first in a series of techno thrillers featuring Jake Adams.The book should appeal to many people since it includes thrills, espionage and even romance. Jake Adams takes you on an adventure through Germany, Italy and other European locations in search of a missing American tech rep. As the former CIA agent unravels the mystery, it becomes more complex. Just when you think you have the mystery solved, the plot takes surprising twists.I'm looking forward to the next Jake Adams adventure."
4,Enjoyable thriller,"4 stars for a solid thriller that has a very clear storyline, keeps you hooked until the very end and delivers exciting action and suspense plus a little romance. Jake Adams is an intriguing character and I plan to read some of the other books in the series as well."
3,Ok,"Ok at best. Ok at least. Ok to read. Nothing special. Not good, not bad. Something to download and read."
3,Too Many Exclamation Points!!!,"This was an interesting book but after awhile I noticed that there were way TOO MANY exclamation points in it. Almost every time a character answers with just one word, there's an exclamation point that is totally inappropriate tothe plot. For instance there was one in the book: (""Yes!"", she said serenely.) Why would a serene answer contain an exclamation point? It wouldn't. I don't know who, or if any one proof-reads these books, but they should bemore watchful.I do like the author and have already ordered more titles on my Kindle."
1,A lesson in writing failed fiction,"Unfortunately, Trevor Scott attempted to use the ingenious style of Tom Clancy in writing a complex international intrigue spanning several characters scattered throughout a multitude of countries. Somewhere in the process he lost his focus on the plot. Good guys and bad guys pop up like targets at a shooting gallery. The plot is lost in the mesh of characters that don't seem to remember which side they are on. The characters are lost in their lack of clear identity with the plot.So, all-in-all, I, as the reader, was simply unable to follow who was after what; I kept hoping that that the story would resolve some of the confusion as it went. Instead, to the last page I never found out who ""won,"" and who ""lost,"" nor what they gained by the entire saga.....and ultimately, I did not care.Find another book. This one is not worth reading."
2,Who edited this book???,"The overall story was, as many have said, fairly one deminsional. Its not difficult to see what is coming, where the story is going, and what exactly is going to happen. That being said, it wasn't an aweful story to read. I did read it through to the end, so that has to say something.My major qualm with this book was the seemingly arbitrary punctuation. Primarily the use of exclaimation points. They seem to crop up at very unordinary and irrational points throughout the reading. It made it borderline painful to read. I really wonder what the hell the editors were thinking when they allowed this to go to publication with this seemingly basic ""mistake.""For a dollar, not bad buy, but there are definitely better books out there..."
3,"Good,not great!",Well written but slow paced! Most of the action wrapped up in the last 30 pages. Easy and fast read!
2,Ahh.......okay I guess.,Found several places in the book where a sentence was lost from one page to the next. It would not be completed and another would start. Plot was scattered all over the place. Action was to slow for my taste. Found I had to force myself to finish the book. It became more of a chore than enjoyable to read.
3,Fatal Network,"This was an easy to read book, with some highlights, but also some unrealistic situations that were more to keep the story moving rather than make an effort to give a plausible outcome. I still find the books easy to read."
3,Fatal Network - A good book,"This is my first time for this author and I'm pleased. I've read all of James Patterson's books and was looking for a new author when I happened to meet Trevor Scott in my dentist's office in Portland Oregon (he was writing while he waited for his appointment). I ordered a couple of his books to see if I liked his writing style. He builds good suspense, has some fun, keeps you guessing and I learned a lot about aircraft carriers. I'd recommend this book."
1,Just awful,"This is not a good read. The characters are very one-dimensional, the writing is average at best and, most unforgivable of all, the story is boring. To call this book a ""thriller"" is totally inaccurate. There was nothing - and I mean nothing - thrilling about Fatal Network. I would recommend avoiding it."
4,excellent!,This book is great for anyone studying econ. It works as a great supplement to any teaching course as well as a functional refresher.
5,Couldn't be more pleased with my toaster,"I have only had my new toaster for 2 days. I use a toaster every day, sometimes several times a day. I am very happy with the consistency of toasting with my new Kitchenaid toaster. I like my toast at a 3 setting and my granddaughter likes a 2 setting. I can make mine first and then hers, and hers is just right, I could never do this with any other toaster. Also, there is no guesswork with the digital setting, a 3 is always exactly the same. The warm button is handy when I can't get to the toaster right away. Before, I had to push it down again and hope to catch it before it burned. I recommend this product to anyone who, like me, enjoys a perfect piece of toast."
2,Disappointed,"I own a KitchenAid Mixer, Food Processor & Blender. I figured the toaster would the perfect addition. So far I have been extremely disappointed. Even at the setting 9, the toast isn't done. It takes at least two cycles. I also have had problems with the edges being burnt. I know it's only toast, but geez for $90 you wouldn't think you would have to worry. Also disappointed in the size of the slots. I think this may go into the appliance graveyard."
2,"looks good, performs horrible","The first time I used this toaster, it shorted out and then wouldn't work after that. The handle would not lock in place in the down position. I gave it 2 stars only because the design and color were appealing to me."
3,Mediocre toaster,"This toaster has fine features, but one annoying deficiency. With most types of bread that we enjoy (i.e., dense, whole grain), we cannot get dark brown toast, even at the darkest setting.The toast comes out light tan, at best. In order to achieve the darkness we want, it's necessary to repeat the cycle at a lower setting. It only takes a couple more minutes, but nevertheless is annoying to have to do so. Perhaps it's a lemon, but we can buy lemons at the store for 33 cents."
5,two slice toaster,Purchased aver a year ago. works great simle and easy to clean very happy with purchase. Was quite hard to find.
2,Kitchen$$Aid,Too much money for a two slice toaster that toasts unevenly and always needs a little more time.
4,"Toaster, not Brave but Effetive","Works well. I had been somewhat concerned in making a mail order, since we have had some experience with more complicated toasters not working. With complexity comes complications. But this one works fine, survived transit without issues. It is more elaborate that earlier versions of the same name, so you will need to read the instruction manual."
3,Mediocre toaster,"This toaster has fine features, but also one serious deficiency. For the types of bread we enjoy (dense, whole grain), it is impossible to get dark toast, even at the highest setting. To achieve the darkness we want, rather than light tan, it is necessary to repeat the toasting cycle at a lower setting. While this only takes a couple more minutes, it is a major annoyance. Perhaps we got a lemon, but lemons shold not cost 50 bucks. We can buy them at the store for 33 cents."
3,Overdoing thickness capacity can be a problem,"Came to Amazon looking to replace my KTT460wh. Like other reviewers I was experiencing burned edges and centers which never browned, no matter how high the setting. This had not been a problem with my previous large slice toaster. Looked at reviews of other makes for a model which was not reported to burn the edges and was disappointed. It seems all models have this problem. I have come to the conclusion that maufactures are competing by advertising their units as taking ever thicker slices. However, this means the heating elements are moved further apart and toasting of ordinary thick slices is compromised. I am left wishing I hadn't given away my old toaster which did just fine a big slices 3/4 to 1 inch thick."
2,Kitchen Aid KTT460WT 2-slice tpaster,"Very poor performance. Does not toast evenly. Very disappointed in this product. Would never buy one again. Warming Bagel function is the only part of this toaster that is worth while. So, if you only warm bagels, it's fine."
4,Pretty much how I remembered it.,"My 6th grade teacher, Ms Hitter (really), read this to the whole class. I remembered the warm fuzzies and cold pricklies being the point of the book. Meaning that people come in both varieties. There was more than that to it. I have enjoyed reading it to my daughter. A must have? Maybe not, but certainly a warm memory for me."
4,rich storyline and character development,"This book is not as exciting as the first, typical for a trilogy. I don't really like how much if focuses on Gaultry because I always wanted to hear more about Mervion. Maybe that will be in the third book. Sometimes I don't like reading about drama after drama and this book does have a lot of fighting and violence but overall it is very interesting and definetely well written. Just don't expect easy paced or light hearted!"
5,Nature's Three,This is a great fiber supplement. It has a pleasant apple taste and works well. It is easy to prepare and the container is easy to open and store.
3,Cute Book About Bloodsuckers,"If you're looking for an action-packed vampire book, this isn't it. If you're interested in the day to day mundane life of a vampire-run society and how exactly a vampire can parent a mortal girl in world that views her as a delicacy, this book might be just up your alley. This book really is cute. It's just a sweet story with a macabre premise. I found the middle of the novel to be slow, but Sosnowski is genuinely funny, which pulled me through the dull parts. This isn't great literature, but it's original for the genre and a fun read."
5,Unusual meditation on parenthood,"Vampires roam the world in an awful lot of novels, those from the gothic meta-porn of Anne Rice to the humor of Christopher Moore's Practical Demonkeepting.Vamped has taken this a step further, until vampires run the world. The non-un-dead (double negative?) are left to hide and be farmed for those vampire epicures who prefer the real thing over a cloned substitute. The hero of this book is somewhat to blame for this change of events. His guilt leads him to take responsibility for an orphaned human child.There are bits of 28-days like ""run from the bad monsters"", humor in the Christopher Moore vein, and interesting speculations on what would happen in a world rules by the undead, but instead, overall the book works as a meditation on what it means to be a parent in an age of terrorism.Oddly affecting and very successful on all levels."
4,Sweet story...,"One of the better vampire novels I have read lately. Usually when I choose to read a vampire novel it is one that borders on horror, such as Anne Rice or the absolutely divine Anita Blake series by Laurell K Hamilton. I read about this one in Time Out New York magazine, gave it a spin and was very glad that I did. This novel is so sweet in places it will hurt your teeth, and so touching in others that it will tug your heart strings. Definately a good 'weekend read'."
3,Enjoyable but....,"This is a world where vampires rule and humans are pretty much extinct. The story centers around a vampire who stumbles upon a little human girl. He initially looks at her as a snack but then realizes that there may be more to (eternal) life.The story isn't exactly heartwarming and the kid is huge brat at times, but it's a decent read. I would have liked it more had there been more excitement, a little more danger, more ""something,"" because when you see ""vampire"" on the book, you think adventure...! Well....think again. This is a story about growing up (figuratively and literally), when you're alone in the world. It's a journey of personal growth.The book meanders around, sometimes you care, sometimes you don't. But the author does a nice job of making the main character sympathetic and you do feel for him a little bit. By the time you finish the book, you care. But not a whole heck of a lot happens."
3,A welcome variation on the Vanpire theme.,"A welcome variation on the vampire theme which gives good story, especially for the slackers and lackers amongst us. Imaginative and fun but lacks momentum. Loved the first half; didn't care for the last half."
1,Too much mental contemplation for a vampire that isn't human,"I saw this book in Barnes and Noble and was captivated by the cover. It seemed interesting even when i read a couple of line from the first chapter. But after having read 71 pages, I just can't get into this book. It is well written, but at the same time, he just thinks too much. Every second flashing back to memory because of the present. Also housing a little human girl for the sake that he might still be human or have some shred of humanity seems dumb. I just can't read anymore, for me there's nothing to keep going on with him and little Isuzu Trooper Cassidy. What a shame how I had hopes for this book. I have never really given up on a book so quick, shame to say this is my first."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book just plain stuck, sucked, boooooooooooring. Thankful for me I got it from the library and didnt spend a dime on it. Very disappointing."
5,A great twist on an old tail!,"I just loved this book. Anyone who likes their horror fiction firmly rooted in 'reality' should enjoy it. The characters are a little 2D but you don't care as the story grabs you and takes you on a great ride. The premise is clever and a great twist on the legend for anyone jaded by all the hackneyed re-hashes out there.Now that they've made ""Vampire$"" into a movie I hope Shapes isn't too far behind (especially now that effects technology is at the required level)."
3,"Sounds great, but cat doesn't agree","I bought this product because of all the great reviews. I like that it's all natural and full of protein. But when I try to give it to my cat, he doesn't go crazy for it. He does like other treats like chewy or crunchy ones. I'm not sure if it's the fishy smell/taste or the form, which is light and thin flakes, that he doesn't like. I give it three stars for effort because he does eat it reluctantly."
5,I have a Birman Cat,"My cat is three years old and does not like any other cat treats except Kitty Kaviar, he absolutely loves it,would recommend to anyone who enjoys making their cat happy."
4,2 out of 3 cats love it,"My 3 cats are super picky treat eaters. They only like real meat. I've tried other bonito flakes and no one cared for them. With these, 2 of my cats inhale them. Its funny to watch them scarf them down. Sadly, my uber picky cat didn't go for the flakes. I'm still searching for something that comes out of a bag or a container that will please the King."
1,A waste of money for us,"I was really happy to find another cat treat that was natural and free of fillers/preservatives/chemicals. That said, none of my four cats will touch this stuff, even though two of them eat almost anything. Much better to give them treats like Three Dog Bakery ""We Pity the Kitties"" freeze-dried salmon, Feline Greenies, or just plain tuna."
1,MY CARS ARE ADDICTED; GREAT PRODUCT,"As I stated above, this is a great product for cats. My four cats, some old some young, love it. Especially my 5 years old male tabby.And, the store shipping the product is really fast. Thank you...my cats George and Gracie thank you.Carol Sheats"
5,Interstate Exit Authority,"Best book I have ever used while traveling in the U.S. You will know what services are available well in advance of signage. Has been extremely helpful when automotive mechanical emergencies occur, since you can look up the exits ahead to determine service availability"
3,Good but not completely satisfying,"In the search to fill in my Scratch collection, I purchased this collection of tracks from 1969-1975.While I mostly favor material from his period of classic releases, I wanted to experience earlier less familiar tracks.The album starts with two great instrumentals;but five in a row kind of kill the momentum.For me the stand out tracks are ''Back Wey'' an uncommonly encountered female led dj cut and its dub ''Dreadlocks Faye''. A personal favorite is LSPs ''Bury the Razor'' and its insanely bass heavy dub ''Cheat Weston Head''.There are some really nice spiritual early roots tracks on this collection but there is filler as well.I would suggest getting his more acclaimed material such as ''Arkology'' or ''Super Ape''.Overall though this is a good compilation to fill in with."
5,Costumer service,"I ordered a table, and Super Seller Co. sent the table to us. When I opened the box, I found the table damaged. I called Super Seller Co. and spoke with Brian. He took care of everything hassle free, and is sending me a new table. That's great customer service. Thanks Brian."
5,Spare Table,"Thank goodness it is light weight, but sturdy enough for use as an extra dining table. It has already served us well for both craft projects and dining!"
3,"Poor packaging, shipping and handling results in damage","two of the six tables came with gouges in the center and had to be sent back - a rather labor intense process and not really one of the ""easy returns"". Others had some bulges on the edges that I suspect were forklift damage as they seem to appear in the same space."
3,Great table and great value except ...,"... it arrived with several noticeable dents in the top. With a talbecloth, it worked and looked just fine. Were it not for the damaged table surface, I would give this table five+ stars. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to negotiate a return and replacement so kept it and used it ""as is"". The table is as advertised and a bit sturdier than I expected. It is relatively lightweight and easy to fold and move. It sits 8 comfortably ... we had 7 with two fondue pots and an assortment of meat, dips and sides."
5,Will delight a wide audience of sports fans,"Here's a sports book even fans who shun reading will enjoy: a centerpiece of funny bloopers in all sports, from boxing and baseball to golf. From the Braves' Andruw Jones running into a wall to sumo wrestler Konishiki being challenged by a tiny opponent, this is packed with fun color photos and will delight a wide audience of sports fans who relish memorable moments."
5,Its Amazing,"I loved the idea when i first heard about it, the 4 team captians with musicians from bands that have graced the roadrunner label. So I bought the CD the day it came out which was a week ago yesterday and I haven't taken it out of my CD player its rare for me to find a CD like that. There are a few tracks I dont care too much for like the Dani Filth track, the music is amazing on it I just don't care too much for his voice. Some of the Stronger tracks are, The Enemy, Annilation By The Hands Of God, The End, The Rich Man, and Blood and Flames. Those are just key tracks but the whole CD is amazing."
2,download the songs that you want,"there are a lot of songs on this album that just plain suck. do yourself a favor. save your money & go to itunes or another downloading program and get the dagger, independent, and absolutley get rich man. those 3 songs are the only ones that made the album anything at all. the rest of the songs just seem to be fillers. i really wanted to give this album a good review, but i can not because of the inconsistancy of quality songs on the album"
2,A Few Good Songs...,"There are a few good songs on this cd. I figured i was going to like the King Diamond track ""Into the Fire"" because I am such a big fan, but it wasn't that good.And Trivium sucks... They shouldn't have been allowed to be part of this."
4,Great compliation album!,"This a compliation album for Roadrunner Records of the various members of some of their bands all playing together in different songs. This is a GREAT album. It is now 2012 and this cd came out in 2005 and is still the best compliation album in the metal scene (even over Nuculear Blast's), in my opinion. So many of the songs here are really great. In the Fire is my absolute favorite. The subject matter (Salem Witch trials) combined with King Diamond on vocals (high voice and low range playing the two different groups; the witch and the townspeople) - it's just a FANTASTIC metal tune on all accounts. It is worth the purchase of this CD alone. The Enemy, Independent and Army of the Sun are also really great tunes and standouts as well. You see styles combied here that you never normally do. Buy this, I don't care what year it is you are reading this review; buy it."
3,nothing great,"nothing much to say just a mediocre cdOverall 75/100best songs:no mas control,blood and flames,baptized in redemption"
3,"CD was good, DVD was better","This was a pretty good cd complilation, but by far, the bonus dvd was really what was worth the price. I hadn't really listened to much from Roadrunner since the 80's, so I could go through and pick out the artists I liked best and then check out their individual bands. Got some great cds, both new and old school, out of this comp."
2,Mannheim Steamroller Christmas,"This is a beatifully written and beautifully packaged book. The problem is that it goes on and on about the traditions, carols and spirit of Christmas and absolutely leaves the birth of Jesus Christ out. It subtly suggests that the birth of Jesus is not the primary reason for celebrating at Christmas time. The book jacket describes the author Chip Davis as the composer and musician who introduced New Age music. This book would bear that out because it is a very new age story. I cannot recommend this book unless you want to know more about New Age philosophy."
3,Unique story,"I liked the story overall, it was unique in a lot of ways. Nice to have a Christmas book that isn't exactly the same as all the others. They tried to make a case for why Christmas traditions are important. While I am very in favor of Christmas traditions, I don't think their ""why"" worked very well. It was sort of the moral of the story, & it just didn't really ring true to me. I also get tired of stories like this having Santa in there somewhere wanting to ""give up"" for whatever reason. There is magic in this book however, especially the connection to Christmas spirit & music. So even with the flaws I enjoyed reading it; but it's not up there with my favorites."
5,So Amazingly Hilarious,"I cannot believe how funny this cd is. It is the last one and each cd gets funnier and funnier. Even though its just one guy doing the voices you still hear it through the customers point of view, getting transfered to some one new who is even more rude than the first guy. How funny was Jim Bobs laugh on ""Save the drama"" Stu Jamison is beyond funny not beleiving the woman when she told him she wasn't drunk. The telephone company was a complete riot. My favorite was ""Respect for your customers"" especially when Willie takes time to explain that because he's from the ghetto, thats why he's so rude, as if that justifies his attitude. I am not just saying that this is funny because I enjoyed it. This cd is worth the money and so incredibly hilarioius. It's great to listen to when you have company over. Just the fact that these calls have real people trying to call real companiesrather than pranking a real company makes it that much more funnier."
3,Groovy soulful ska tunes from the Midwest's leading ska band,"Formerly Issac Green & Skalars, Isaac has given up his singing post to manage the band. Third wave ska, but no punk here, just smooth rocksteady R&B sounds, above average vocals, happy melodic songs.From St' Louis.DTM"
5,Excellent product,The cover roll works beautifully. It holds the tape great and makes everything easy to remove.
2,Bad Vibes,"I agree it was very entertaining when I was 12. I was also under the impression that it was somewhat true and it's very disappointing that a woman would be in such denial about her own lack of parenting skills that she'd go out of her way to make it look like some evil forces made her son kill himself.Maybe if she was less delusional and more responsible, her son wouldn't have killed himself.Ultimately, read it if you want, but please don't perpetuate the lie by actually paying for it."
4,Jay's Journal,"This was a weird, creepy but fun book to read. I liked this book and if you like journals of people's lives than you would like this book. I like this book because it was interesting and creepy and I like creepy books."
4,Jay's Journal Review,"Jay's Journal the Anonymous is a fantastic book to read if you have to read it for Psychology class like I did. It's about a young boy with an IQ of 149 and master of debate who joined a cult dedicated to Satanism, witchcraft and Ouija boards.He was fasinated by the black and white magic being used. He wanted to know if it was true or a bunch of Hocus Pocus."
3,Jay's Journal,"Everyone always thinks that nothing like that can happen to there child. This book proves that it does. A lonely and depressed 16 year old boy finds himself thrown into the world of drugs. He steals from his father's pharmacy in order to keep the girl of his dreams happy. When he is caught his parents send him to a rehab center. There he meets someone who helps him get into satanism.The one thing that I hated about this book was that it isn't all real. ""Jay"", his real name was Alden Barrett grew up in Utah. In 1997 Alden's brother Scott published a book called A Place in the Sun the Truth Behind Jay's Journal. Scott included a facsimile of Jay's original journal. Alden had his problems and did kill himself but he wasn't involved in Satanism at all. Out of the whole book about 25 entries came out of Alden's journal. The other 90+ were either made up or came from other kids that Beatrice Sparks interviewed."
1,I Am From Where Alden is From.,"Which is really sad cause most of the town new it was fake, but still they would do stuff like go to the cemetery and one incident they smashed his tombstone. If you would like to read his actually diary I would read ""A place in the Sun"" by his brother."
5,"Story is true, i grew up in his hometown","I grew up in pleasant grove. My best friend's mother went to school with ""jay"" whose real name is... On the night that he married his girlfriend in the cemetary, there was a school dance, and everyone was talking about it. She recalls talking with him. She told me he was always talking about his ""other religions"" and his ""experiments with the devil."" So to anyone who doesnt beleive this story is true, think again."
5,this is true,I live in Alpine Utah. this story took place in Pleasant Grove Utah that town is five minutes away from my house. i know that it is true because I have seen his grave. It is in the lehi cemetary which is another adjacent town to mine. but the interesting thing about his grave is that on certain nights you can see his grave glow. i didn't believe this until me and my friends snuck in at night and saw an eerie green glow. I have never been back since i saw that. and there are also many other strange things that go on around my town that many people say are attributed to him and his friends. So to close all I have to say is that this is a true story. Oh and by the way his real name isn't jay its alden.
4,yikes!,"this book was good, even though i hate to admit it. i was terrified to go to sleep alone in the dark after reading it, so i spent weeks falling asleep with a light on. i don't recommend it to anyone unless they want the ... scared out of them."
4,WHY SO SCARY?,"I read this entire book today and was expecting more. I'm 16 and thought it was rather tame compared to what I had heard about people having nightmares and such. I did like how the book tied itself together at the end but it also left me hanging. Because of this book's religious content and my lack of religious knowledge, to that of occult in nature only, I had to do some research in the nearest Bible to figure out some of the religious points but it was all together good. I do recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in anything different. Especially those who like to study about religion, it will give you a good base for what goes on inside someone's head."
4,A story people of all ages should read,"Are you at a confused stage in your life? Are you feeling alone? Well, so was 16 year old Jay. The book, Jay's Journal, tells his story. Jay started out innocently enough. He was a good kid concerned about teachers, girlfriends, grades and his parents. But his girlfriend's drug addiction led Jay to steal pills from his father's pharmacy- starting Jay's downfall. Then Jay met Tina. She was intriguing and Jay soon found out why. Tina led Jay into a world of Ouija boards, voodoo, witchcraft, Satanism and animal sacrifice. He followed innocently, but not innocent enough. He became deeply involved in the occult meetings Tina held. Jay's two best friends were killed in accidents. Jay became tormented and lost control. He gave in and killed himself. I think you should read this book because it is a good example of what peer pressure can do. This book is a true story and even though it's sad, it's touching, and sure, frightening."
3,Half True,"I found this book interesting because I am growing up in Pleasnat Grove, and going to the school he did. I have been to his headstone. I have family members that went to school and sat next to him. Some say he could levitate pencils from the desk. This book is 80% true, but just like every other book it adds some spice. What book doesn't? You need to expect it."
1,I don't Believe this!,"Here I was reading this book, thinking that I was actually reading a true story, until I decided to look it up on Amazon. Luckily I didn't pay much (library sell) And things just didn't add up to me either. I was debating on whether or not i wanted to finish this book, and now i do not. And if I wouldve had the option it would have received NO STARS"
1,This book is bunk,"Beatrice Sparks is well known for publishing ""true"" stories based on teenage tragedies.....but the real story is that Ms. Sparks writes these books herself. Seldom are they even based on a true story.It's fiction. All her books are fiction. Don't be fooled. Her books are simply a way for her to spew her propaganda under the ""it could happen to you"" guise.Don't waste your time reading this tripe."
1,Sad but not believable,"I am 41 a mom of 2 teens & I was raised Mormon. I read this & felt like they were blaming the boys problem on the occult, which in truth really felt like they were trying to convince me that he was involved in the occult. All religious families with teens have the same debate in their heads, right vs wrong, want to do the right thing & follow the teachings etc. I was not impressed with the book & would not suggest teens to read this book, it doesn't go into any depression issues, which was really more of a reason I suspect mixed with hallucinogens to the boy. I am sure we all feel bad for the boy & his family, I had the feeling the author was trying to make us feel if he went to church he would have been saved."
2,"Creepy, at best","This is another Sparks book that disappointed me. I understand that she writes fiction. I understand that she sensationalizes her stories. However, I believe this book would have been much better if she left out the whole occult aspect. There was a lot for her to go on without having to make that part up about Jay. Here again she messed up dates and times so that you could tell what entries she was making up. If you're going to make it a journal at least get the dates and times ""correct."" Also the timeline throughout the story wasn't correct, even for a work of fiction. Jay would write about numerous things happening over a span of days but the entries in between would only be a day apart (particularly the entry about drinking the cow blood......the entries didn't add up at all).This story actually left a really bad taste in my mouth. The things she described and the thought sequence was really disturbing (especially towards the end of the story). I don't care to read it again."
1,It's a sham!,"The woman who ""edited"" the real Jay's journal, Beatrice Sparks, only used 12 of the actual entries from ""Jay"" -and none of those entries or any other entries in his journal mentioned the occult in any way. Sparks is a scammer and ruined that family's life. Beyond that, what else is inexcusable is what a terrible writer she is and how she used the same terrible prose in her other scam book, ""Go Ask Alice.""No one should give her anymore money. Shame on you, Beatrice Sparks!"
5,A Should-Be Classic.,"I read this book (for the first time) in junior high school. Supprised at the summary on the back, I picked it up and read it. I must say, it has a great power and influence to it. The story of Jay touched me from beginning to end. Through his theft of drugs, to this occoultism, to his final entry and the note from Jay's mother. It's a phenominal psychological thriller. I, myself, being pagan definetly agree that this book could scare people out of the 'dark side' of The Craft, and I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who isn't mature. But I garuntee you, if you pick this book up, you won't be able to put it down or stop thinking of it. It's a wonderful book that I think people of all backgrounds and relegions would love."
5,a very very powerful book,"This is NOT a novel. This is a young kids journal. I grew up in the same town that this happened, which makes it even sadder for me. The poor kid doesn't even have a gravestone. His parents had it removed because it was being desicrated by satanists, satanists who worshipped Jay for being such a troubled teen that had fallen to satanism. I had to read the book to fully understand what had happened in my community. I sat and cryed when i had finished it. I would not reccomend this book to immature readers, but i would reccomend it to EVERY reader mature enough to handle it. It would be impossible to read this book and not be moved in a very profound way. This book makes one realize that there are forces in this world which are not of this world, forces with a single purpose: To ruin life for those of us fortunate enough to live. I could have been this young man, until i read the book"
3,2 Good 2 B True,I thought overall that the book was ok. It was too good to be a true diary of a teenager. Infact I have done research on this book and it is said to be a joke. Beatrice Sparks is a good writer and all but she can quit with Diary of an Anonymous Teenager because it is not true. Don't get me wrong it was still worth buying because it kept my attention till the end.
1,Quick and boring read.,"Title says it all. I read through this in 3 hours, and I would really like those hours back. Don't bother."
2,ehh,"Well, this book really wasn't that good. I don't even want to finish it but I have to. Part of it is that it is not real. The other part is that it's creepy and weird with all the occult stuff. No offence, but it's scary. Yeah, this book is not that good.I just finished the book. It actually left quite an impact. The things that they did, how everyone died. So, i guess the ending makes the book pretty good.""A Kid's Review""- beatrice sparks is a woman not a man and I agree with you, cut the anonymous teenager stuff"
1,Lies.,"Though it has already been said several times, I just want to reiterate that this book is a work of fiction. It has absolutely no basis in fact. Sparks simply wanted to cash in on the growing Satanism scare, and in the process destroyed a family as well as a boy's memory. A boy who, incidentally, had nothing to do with the occult.In fact, the local police have said that while there was almost no occult activity in town before the book came out, the amount of occult-related crimes committed after the book was published skyrocketed. Luckily, all Ms. Sparks cares about is money, so her job here is done."
1,Book written by a fanatic with a personal vendetta,"This book claims it is a true account, and the fact of the matter is that it is amply distorted by adding false facts in order to accomplish the author's desire to push her religious beliefs to the reader. I believe that any author who deceives her readers in order to push a personal vendetta should be penalized, no matter if she is right or wrong. I assume that through this book she wants to scare those who are tempted to become Satanists, druggies, etc, but I wonder what her religion has to say about tricking people into being close to God? This book is terrifying, and shockingly enough it is supposed to be for kids; in my opinion, it harms a teenager's mind, rather than accomplishing anything else. I wonder how many teenagers have been traumatized by this book. It is definitely not a read for someone who does not have formed criteria."
1,Ridiculous,All of this about witchcraft & the occult is ridiculous garbage. And judging by the other reviews its all made up lies anyways. Would have probably been more interesting if it wasnt made up nonsense that apparently shattered this persons image.
3,Disappointed,"I gave three stars because behind the untruths, I believe there is a good story and interesting person (""Jay).I'm really disappointed to have learned this was turned into fiction. I don't understand the logic behind editing a journal that belonged to a living person, to the point where a valuable story is turned into some fictional (and poorly written) cautionary tale.I think it's shameful for a writer to add story lines that were never legitimate, especially when it can affect someone else negatively (the occult idea).Basically, B.S. stands for more than the writers initials."
3,3 stars for ENTERTAINMENT,"I have given this book 3 stars because... let's say I found it a bit like Go Ask Alice. ....... It's very scary though- not quite what I was expecting. If you are are a bit shaken up by these things (and I assume you know what ""these things"" are by now) don't read it. Wait for the movie, tentatively called ""The Blair Witch Project 2""."
5,Interesting view of the war that never was,"Pat Frank wrote this book in response to someone speculating on a nuclear war with Russians and what it would be like. The book that came out of it was a very interesting look at what life after the war could be like. It embodies the tension of the 50s and a very different lifestyle. Readers today will find it interesting for the study of the different social dynamics and culture. Plus, it is a well written story that provides interesting insight into how things could have been and, of course, the ironic ending.Well worth the time it takes to read."
3,Surprisingly intriguing!,"it's been a long time since i read this book--junior year, high school, English class--but i remember clearly what the book was about and how i felt about it. it's the kind of book where you automatically make your assumptions that it would be boring or out-dated, but me and many other classmates were surprised by the time we finished it. afterward, i was grateful that my teacher required us to read it. Frank provided a bird's eye view of the mindset of average Americans were in the 1950s with the threats of ""World War III""--the baseline of the story. a great book of which, if i had become a teacher, i would also require my class to read! go check it out."
4,a book worth reading,"When I first began reading Alas, Babylon as part of my summer reading assignment for school, I imagined it would be very boring and not worth the trouble. At the start of the book, it did take a while for it to interest me, but as soon as the nuclear attacks began, I couldn't put down the book. I finished it within the next day. I reccomend this book to anyone who will give it a little patience at the start, because It will be worth it by the end. You're not going to see too many books with such a wonderful and wild plot as Alas, Babylon. Read the book!"
4,Better then any other book I read in school,The book was pretty good. I understood the writer . Most the books I've read in school I had no clue to what was going on and this one was easy reading and easy to understand. I just wish I could find more information on it in case I missed something. But I am still to find something.
3,Well-done Fiction,"Alas, Babylon was very good novel in my opinion. It combined a compelling (if somewhat far-fetched) story with action and gripping drama. The characters are very believable and realistic. The story line follows a series of events after the start of a nuclear war between Russia and the US. My only complaint is that the author Pat Frank stretched reality a little when it came to the plot. It is a little tough to believe that missiles were launched for the reason they were. Other than that, it is a good read for anyone who enjoys science fiction placed in the near future (or in this case, 50 years ago)."
3,I was ready to leave Babylon,"I have read many of the reviews and I question all the 5 star reviews. This book just seemed to go on and on. I think the main thing I got out of the story was that we really need to prepare. I don't think any one could survive the way they did in the book. So for that reason I thought this book deserved 3 stars, it gets you thinking. What if, the world as we know it was not there anymore? I was bored many times during the book where I would skip ahead because the same subject would come up over and over again. Read this if you want to learn more about the atom bomb hitting America and the fall out that happened from the bomb. Otherwise pass."
5,Nostalgic and thought provoking..........,"This was a wonderfully nostalgic 50's ""end of civilization as we know it"" read for me as a pre-baby-boomer who spent grade school ""dropping"" under my desk during A-bomb drills. I read this book as a kid and now again as a senior (polite name for old fart). It is really a speculation on ""human nature"" using the what if of global nuclear war as the catalyst. With infrastructure suddenly at about the level of 1900(?) speculating on how things would shake out in a small community, it makes an interesting read. Like it then and like it now."
3,"Alas,Babylon","The book Alas, Babylon is a great book which has alot of suspense.Randy is a young man that has to become responsible for him and a girl named Lib ,when a meatear destorys everthing but those two people. This is a little strange since Randy is fat and lazy. I think that the part that says ""The white flashed back into a red ball in the southeast.They all knew what it was.Thus the lights went out and in that moment civilazation in Fort Repose retreated a hundred years.So ended this day.""I think this sums up the style and shows that this book is intense.I really enjoyed this book and it always kept me reading."
2,by Ian Callaghan,"I think the book could've moved faster than it did. I think there could've been more action, like in the part of the book when the American pilot shoots a missle at the Russian pilot and misses. Instead of Randy finding all the people in the neighborhood and getting them all together, and helping them. I also think they shoudv'e said whether Mark died or not."
1,Unimaginative,"My first complaint is that the story is unimaginative. Prior to buying this book, I had read the summary and formed a general idea about how such a story would go. The story ended up matching my general idea almost exactly. Nothing unexpected happens. There were no plot twists and few clever moments.My second complaint is that the characters all have the same personality and speak in the same voice. The dominant personality trait of every character is that they speak plainly about matters both great and small. It drove me nuts.My last complaint is that the story is not well researched. The effects of nuclear bombs and radiation are grossly inaccurate. The portrayal of the US government and military was simplistic. The author seems to have nothing more than common knowledge about nuclear war, military, and government. I learned almost nothing from this book."
2,Not an acceptable book,"When I opened the book, I noticed many unnecessary writtings and drawings. The book was not close to being in a good condition."
2,alas babylon,"This book is in very poor condition. The spine is broken, pages are loose and a very poor library edition. This is my first negative review and I hope my last. Book was not as represented and I paid a premium price."
5,chillingly accurate...filled with the glory of human spirit,"Alas, Babylon remains one of my all-time favorites. As a senior in high school, we studied this novel and while many classmates seemed to find it a bore, I was hooked. I've read it 100 times in the last 20 years, and I will continue to do so...even though my copy is falling apart! The strength and realism of the characters helps us to strongly identify with Pat Frank's underlying message: that nuclear war, if and when it comes, will take many of us by surprise."
5,A great read rediscovered,"I first read this book as a high school reading assignment. I chose the book from the teacher's list by ruling out the other listed books that I did not have an interest in reading. I had no idea what I was getting into, it was just an assignment. I still remember the first time I read this book. It was a library book, so I returned it. Later, I searched Amazon for the book - remembering only ""something about Babylon."" Since rediscovering this book, I've read it several times. I don't think about the historic nuances or the authenticity of the plot. I read it for the story of ordinary people thrown into extraordinary circumstances. The characters are not ""all knowing and heroic,"" they bumble and stumble through an apocalyptic world much like the rest of us would."
5,A must-read apocalyptic novel,"This is the best apocalyptic book I've ever read. It's definitely a classic. It may be a little dated, and it doesn't have all the gory details as McCammon's ""Swan Song,"" but it's entertaining, and scary, from cover to cover. Certainly helps one appreciate peace. It's almost a survival guide. You'd have to be closed-minded and naieve not to acknowledge these terrifying possibilities...."
2,Not great...,"The characters were flat with absolutely no depth. Randy was more believable at the beginning of the story as a washed-up lawyer than the packs' leader at the end. The story wasn't believable and for the survivors to have such a happy, alls' well, ends' well, ending...was stretching it. The most developed and interesting character was Florence Wechek and she was forgotten towards the end, in the rush to wrap things up neatly and nicely. And how convenvient that the family had running water.... On The Beach was better---"
3,Library edition,"I remember the book from many years ago and wanted to have it for my collection. The story was just as good as I remembered but if I had known what a ""library edition"" was, I would have bought something else. It has no jacket and has a very plain cover, much to my disappointment."
2,"alas,babylon","I have read the book lately. I liked and disliked the book. The book took to long to get to the good parts. When it got to the good part around the end of the book I really liked the out-come. Like finding out that they were not contaminated by the pollution. But thought that they would go and leave Fort Repose. I thought it was sweet when Randy and Lib got married. I also live maybe an hour and half from Orlando and Tampa, Fl."
5,READ IT IN HIGH SCHOOL,"i THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING, I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. MARVELOUS WRITING AND CREATIVITY."
5,"Alas, Babylon","I read this book so many times, the cover fell off. This is a new copy. It is in my permanant library."
5,truly remarkable a great book,This is one of the best books that I have ever read and I am a young reader. Pat Frank did an excellent job back when he wrote this book. I wish that more books were like this and that we would be exposed to the more often. This book leaves wanting a sequel and not wanting to put it down to go eat. It is truly a remarkable book and I suggest it to everyone.
3,simple & interesting,"Written in 1959 Alas, Babylon was one of the first post-nuclearapocalyptic novels. The author generously grants hischaracters a fallout free zone in which to maneuver sincethere would be little to write about otherwise. He focuseson the can do attitude of the survivors while understatingthe profound emotional dislocation that would surely accompanysuch a situation. The narrative is linear and extremely easyto read. As a bonus, there is an appendix giving interestinghistorical and biographical info. Try it."
5,I am teaching this wonderful little gem of a book.,"I am a high school English teacher and I'm teaching this novel for the first time. Young adults seem to love it as much as I did. As for comments such as, ""it has a slow start"" I have to remind students that every novel has exposition to give the reader background and the first 50 pages of most books is a chore. Once you hit page 90, you won't want to put this book down. The very best part of this novel is that P. Frank has the ability to make you want to hear the next civil defense update just as the characters in the novel want to hear updates. You are pulled into the events of the novel and taken on a ride along with the characters - always anxious to hear the next update of the world, the new President, Mark, etc. A good high school novel - easy to read and understand, fun to discuss."
5,It was mostly about a town trying to survive after a bomb.,"The book had a slow beginning but, it began to get more interesting after the bomb occured. I thought it was great in the fact that you looked through many different character's points of views. The book got intense at the end and was, overall, wonderful. It was also wonderful being able to look at how things changed from before the bomb to after the bomb. You began to see how people can get easily discouraged if everyone does not pull together to help one another. The book really showed me that these people were afraid but, never the less, worked as a team in trying to make their lives as they had once been. It also showed how some people can become greeedy and only begin to think about themselves. It changed my point of view on life and how something so dear and precious to you can be taken away in an instant. The book was touching and great."
3,"i'm not normally into the classics, but decent","i wasnt sure whether i should give the bk 3.5 or 4 stars. it was a decent book i guess, problem was it was vry predictable and nothing happened after the bomb fell. they try to survive but none of the characters were praticularly well developed and i didnt really care when one was sad or whatever. so i gave it 3.5 stars. gotta lve characters and i didnt. but it's one of the better classic post-apocs i've read. if you like this book or wanted more action, read ""the sleep of the gods"" and ""one second after."""
4,"Alas, Babylon","Great book. I first read this book in college, 30 years ago. Some parts of this book have stayed with me all the years since that time. For instance, the description of ""valuable items"" traded in the market place, including safety pins and pencils. The struggle to survive of the regular citizens of this small town makes me want to go learn something about survival skills, or hope that I am at ground zero of a bomb myself."
1,"Alas, Babylon STUNK!","Alas, Babylon was one of the worst dated books I have ever read. The plot is dangling and the characters don't seem real(neither does the plot, for that matter). I think this whole ""war"" think is very hyped up, and will not happen!"
1,both completely unreallistic and boring,"A book about a war that intelligent people know would never happen, it makes no sense."
1,"Alas, Babylon","This book was stupid, it didnt make sense! The author should re ashamed of itself for writing such a boring and unthrilling book! I would really like to thank the author, because since my teacher choose her book, our class had to read it, it was boring and I dont see how anyone could get interested in something so stupid!"
4,Anyone interested in nukes should read this book.,"This was required reading for Nuclear Weapons and World Politics course in college (our lighter reading). I enjoyed the realism that it brought when you get to the point and say, ""This could happen to me."""
5,Required reading in W. Central Florida,"Alas, Babylon was a very good book. I just got through reading it and I thought ""my god, this could happen here"" I live in one of the cities mentioned in the book. I'm writing on my essay now. Remember I read this in my freshmen class of English1."
4,Scary look at Atomic War and survival,"This book was written back in the fifties when people thought you could still sruvive an atomic war. With modern weapons we know that there is no hope of survival but it is still good to read about the skills, attitude and trials that people would face in the total breakdown of civilization because as we have seen over the last decade the line between civilization and wilderness is very thin indeed. This work of fiction is scary close to reality. Slightly dated though it is still something people should consider reading."
5,Read This Book Now,"If you have not read ALAS, BABYLON, read it now. Pat Frank in his newspaper-reporter style tells what happened in Florida when the United States was the victim of nuclear destruction. Back during the Cold War when ALAS, BABYLON filled the bookshelves, the book seemed to be a piece of escape literature. Now, it gives some insight into survival, a subject on our minds."
4,A very good classic read,A good read written during the early years of the Cold War. I enjoyed it immensely and think anyone looking for an entertaining read of early post-apocalyptic fiction genre will as well.
4,Classic Novel of a time when the bomb hung over our heads.,"If any Novel can be said to be a classic of the time whenchildren grew up with the fear of the Atomic Bomb falling on them ,thier friends and family.... this is it.Randy gets some warning from his brother that things are heating up and that an atomic war could be about to happen. With his sister in law and her kids they try to survive the atomic war that happened much quicker that anyone could have expected.A compelling novel full of realistic insights of a time in the not too distant past... or perhaps the near future. Read this book."
3,simple & interesting,"Written in 1959 Alas, Babylon was one of the first post-apocalyptic novels. The author generously grants hischaracters a fallout free zone in which to maneuver sincethere would be little to write about otherwise. He focuseson the can do attitude of the survivors while understatingthe profound emotional dislocation that would surely accompanysuch a situation. The narrative is linear and extremely easyto read. As a bonus, there is an appendix giving interestinghistorical and biographical info. Try it."
3,"Alas, Babylon",Worth the read. Different classes of people coming together and benefiting from each others knowledge. It may have been written a long time ago but still applies today.
4,Watch,I've read this book many yrs ago and I think it is an eye opener to the times we are living in 2009. Our world is in turmoil and a nucular war is not out of the question probably beginning in Iran attacking Israel. It won't make much difference who or where it will start things going wrong everywhere in this world! Its worth a good read!
3,"Alas, ""Alas Babylon""","I guess that after reading my favorite post-apocalyptic novel, Stewart's ""Earth Abides"" all others pale by comparison to that classic. This is no exception. I found the story predictable and shallow; the characters cardboard and stereotypic. One problem with these kinds of novels is that they necessarily are pretty much all the same. When the lights go out or the bombs fly or the germs start multiplying society grinds to a halt in the same fashion. Only the location and the characters change. On the other hand, there are moments of emotion and suspense here and though extremely dated by the parameters of the Cold War, it is another reminder that things can go terribly wrong for the human race. I would say ""Earth Abides"" or Shute's, ""On the Beach"" are better, but if you like post-apocalyptic books, you could do worse than ""Alas, Babylon."""
4,A Cold War Classic,"The story of how the residents of Fort Repose, Florida learn to adapt to the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. Set in the same time in which it is written, the late 1950s, this novel provides a realistic account of what may have happened. There are some chilly parallels to today's world (the nuclear war begins because of an accidental strike by a US bomber on a Syrian port). A good book for teenagers. Read this along with Nevil Shute's *On the Beach*."
5,Home radiator from the year 1891,My forced hot water radiator sprung a leak I patched it with jb kwick then for extra jb weld on top .Great savings as opposed to replacing it no plumber ect.
2,Isn't as strong as original,"I've used both the original and the KWIK and must say I'm more impressed with the original. The KWIK definitely cures faster but the hold doesn't appear as strong. For example, I've used the original JB Weld in the past to attach metal hasps to metal ammo cans with fairly good results. The hasp's staple will stay affixed and will only detach using a cold chisel and hammer.I recently attached a hasp staple to a metal ammo box with the KWIK version and the bond failed miserably. The KWIK set quickly but after one rap on the outside of the box (i.e. no chisel needed) the staple detached immediately. I performed this test three days after the the bond had cured.My main complaint is that the packaging does not clearly indicate that the KWIK version (part no. 8276) is less strong than the original (part no. 8265). Had I known this, I wouldn't have purchased it and would have stuck with the higher tensiled rated 8265. Doing so would have saved me time, aggravation and $."
1,"I gave it chances, it gave me failures","Having used both this and the original, I can't believe the failure rate I've had with this stuff.First application was between a textured plastic surface, which I cleaned off with alcohol, and the bottom of a machined and sand blasted chuck of aluminum. In it's defense, this was a heat sink that would get up to 140 F, but the ratings say that this should be no issue at all. Would not stay on. In fact, when the piece fell off for the first time, I just picked the rest of the JB kwik fragments from the surfaces with my fingers to clean it up.Next was gluing two 18650 cells into place, long side down. I slathered the entire length of the cells, not to mention filled in the giant void between the two cells with the stuff. This should have made a massive surface area contact, more than enough to hold the light weight cells. Two weeks later, it fell off.Never going to touch this stuff again.Also, it smells weird unlike the original."
1,garbage,i mixed it up just at the consistency it said 1:1 to fix back together an aluminum hinge on my laptop computer that had broken. said it sets in 4 minutes and cures in 4 hours. i mixed it up and applied it came back to it the next morning 11 hours later and it almost dented with pressing my fingernail into it. nevertheless the hinge adhesion did not hold. this is like using bondo dent filler as a glue. jb weld must do better than this because i've heard rave reviews but i hoped this would be comparable. i broke the latch off on my computer so it would close and went about my business. i don't have time to play games with expensive glues.
4,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (HD-DVD),I'm a fan of street racing and tuning cars. I wanted to add this great movie to my HD-DVD collection. I had an HD-DVD player before a Bluray and wanted a few of these HD-DVDs as these are now cheaper due to being obsolete.
1,Why is this called Fast and Furious?,"This movie doesn't not follow any themes of the previous fast and the furious. It doesn't have any of the original characters or story line. If it was just named Tokyo Drift, It would have been a very good movie. But since it has the name of something that doesn't match the other Fast and Furious movies, I would have to give it a 1 star."
5,It's fast and furious.,"Excellent movie, great cast. Keeps you on the edge of your seat, up beat kind of movie. Makes you wish you were behind the wheel, keeps the blood pumping."
4,Not a bad movie!,"Remember, this is not an Oscar caliber film, just don't put on your thinking cap, and you will enjoy it as much as I did. By the way, Sung Kang defiantly deliver, but the main guy... not so much."
1,Poor Quality,I can not finish the movie because Amazon's video streaming quality is so poor. I have never experienced this while using itunes movies. This is the first and last amazon movie instant movie I purchase.iTunes lets you download to your hard drive so you can always watch it and not have to worry about your internet speed. Also the quality is much better (both picture and sound).
