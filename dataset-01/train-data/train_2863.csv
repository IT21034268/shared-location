3,Riped me off. but great product.,"just to leave it plain and simple. the product was awesome just as they said it was . i bought it like new but they charged me 30$ as i thought that was the price the internet had to offer. little did i know that when i recieved the item, THEY forgot to take off the tag price on it and i learned they OVERPRICED IT. form 15$ to 30$. seems i cant trust this company. but again the item was fantastic."
1,Bought for nothing,"Wish they had told me that this switch is included with the inverter, I now have 2."
2,Battlefield: Monte Cassino,"We were primarily interested in the battle of Monte Cassino, as my husband fought there. Very little of the DVD was devoted to the actual battle there, which was disappointing for us. Also, the format was fragmented, so that you were given the same information over and over again. The DVD was not what we were expecting."
5,Bye bye chiropractors,"I used to see a chiropractor for alignments quite often, but since I read and used Mindful Spontaneity I have gained awareness of my back and internal muscles that connect to the back. The result is a beautiful change in my body's structure: I am taller, the curve in my lumbar is gone, and so on. Every vertabrae in my back is moveable and dynamic now. And I haven't visited my Chiropractor since. I also adopted Ruth's blanket exercises that I do most mornings to remove acquired stiffness from my sleep. This book changed my life for the better."
4,"""our elephant in the living room""","Still have the l985 version and it basically shows what ""priorities"" a country has, vs. what, for ex, we as Americans THINK our priorities are. I would like to see an updated version to see how much MORE we spend on our military although know that the ""black budget"" will not be included. The fact is, the USA IS A MILITARY EMPIRE, and most media will not use that word. We can all clearly see NOW how our domestic health (also a ""national security"" issue) is suffering, AND our ""democracy,"" or I should say, ""plutocracy."""
2,Good for a young girl,"Don't go by the picture - go by the dimensions. The picture makes it look a lot bigger than it is and in fact is probably a picture of the larger version, not this 8X11. It's very pretty, but I wouldn't say quality. The glass is thin and the mirror doesn't have any weight to it. All pieces were there and nothing was broken when it arrived. I ordered it for my 11 year old hoping it was something that she would value for years to come, but it's just ok. I probably wouldn't pay $20 for it if I had to do it over again."
1,"Too small, was missing a rubber padding on arrival","nothing great, looked too small and was missing a rubber padding on one foot, on arrival. Edges are too sharp and may cause injury."
5,EXCELLANT BEAUTIFUL vANITY TRAY,This is a eleganat vanity tray for the money good product. Makes a wonderful gift
4,basement dehumidifiier,"The product is making a significant impact on the basement humidity...there is no longer any damp odor. The humidifier is very quiet. Having a range in the settings provides the appropriate humidity level. The negative features include the fact that the item needed to be delivered by a freight company which required schedule coordination. The product weighs approx. 100 lbs and requires ""muscle power""."
3,Ostentatious and tragic,"This is an interesting account that somehow reminds me of 'Waiting for Guffman' in the pretentious interviews and posturing about a playwright seriously injured in an accident! The bottom line is that it is about a group of self indulgent, and reckless hippy actors and the result of the self destructive bent that seems to plaque so many artistic people. A tragic story that could serve as a warning to anyone living on drugs and alcohol. Perhaps the fact that he understood, at last, what he had lost makes it more devastating. He is lucky that he found people who truly cared and wanted to help. Who knows what he might have been."
5,Bravo! A must-have book for those interested in the Apaches and American Indians in General.,"A great book. If you even have a passing interest in the Apaches, New Mexico, Arizona, American Indian Tribes, etc., you'll enjoy this book."
3,More for beginners,"I love Jeanette and I have many of her DVDs. I bought this because I wanted to start teaching Pilates as I am already a fitness trainer. However, this is definately for beginners or borderline intermediate. I did not find it that challenging."
4,Basketball for Geeks,"If you are a numbers geek, want to write a paper that evaluates some area of basketball, or are looking to develop a way to evaluate what your team/ players contribute to the game, this book is for you. There an interesting chapter on the ""best players ever""; but for the most part Dean Oliver does exactly what the title says; he gives us tools for performance analysis at a level of understanding and sophistication that only he can provide."
4,keyboard drawer,"Not a bad price for a keyboard drawer, everything seems to be working properly and installation was pretty easy."
5,works great!,This is a great under desk computer keyboard tray. It is simple to install and works great. It is sturdy and slides effortlessly. I recommend this product to anyone needing to get their keyboard off the desk.
1,Not worth the effort to install,I bought mine at staples but yikes is this bad. The tray is cheap and wobbly from the start. Within 3 months it was coming off it's rail. The keyboard cannot retract without sliding the mouse tray in so you need to find somewhere to put the mouse if you want to slide it in (which is the whole point of a retractable keyboard tray). It has no redeeming qualities.
3,Decent,Its nice - but the tray that pulls out for the mouse is a piece of junk. I dont use that and have my mouse sitting on top of my desk.
3,Measurements not as expected,"I needed a tray that would work in a limited space. Although the measurements as adverstised were perfect, when the product arrived I found the rails ran past the unitabout three inches. I did ultimately get the tray to fit in my space it is not as I would have preferred. It does, in all fairness, do the job it was made for."
1,this product is lousy,"Do not even waste your time with this under desk keyboard tray.To say I am disappointed in this product would be an understatement. I and my staff has had more problems with screws that don't hold, lost nuts, and mouse trays and drawers that keep slipping out of their tracks. I am now in the process of having to research new under desk keyboard trays, and pay again for the trouble of purchasing and re-installing keyboard trays for something that should not have broken so quickly and been so shoddy to begin with."
4,Good basic keyboard tray,"This tray is well made for the price. The slides are good quality. It's not so strong as to be able to sit on it but normal use will not take it out. The only down side is that it hangs down significantly. Make sure you have the clearance and are mounting it under a high desk or you will have to lower your chair to the floor. For the price, it's hard to beat."
4,Does the job.,The Fellowes keyboard drawer fulfills the purpose for which it is intended. The only point I would change is that the drawer be a bit deeper since my keybord just fits. My keyboard already has a hand rest on it so may be a little wider than some.
4,Impressed,"After reading all of the other reviews on here, I was a bit nervous. After opening the package, i noticed that the plastic looked very cheap but after getting it set up, it glides in and out very easily, it's way more sturdy than i expected, my arms are resting on the tray as i type this, and the mouse holder (which does have some give) does a good job too...with the price of competitors out there, you cant go wrong with the price of this thing"
4,simple and sturdy,"If you are in the least bit handy or have ever put together ikea furniture, this is easy (and a lot easier than a lot of ikea directions...). It is also pretty logical. It is sturdy and easily slides in and out. The mouse tray is plenty sturdy and contrary to what other people have said doesn't have to be retracted to put the drawer away (unless your desk opening isn't large enough which is hardly Fellowes's fault). The space in the tray is large enough for a standard keyboard--I have a dell and there is at least 2.5 inches extra.My only con is that I wish they had one that didn't have the wrist bumper."
5,Very Good Keyboard for the Cost,This is a very good keyboard tray for the cost. I purchased two of them for our small office and they have been used daily for over a year with no problems. The mouse pad could be a little stronger but does the job. I would recommend it.
2,Short term solution,"This item works but cannot hold up to 8 hr workdays. It would be great for homeuse but hot for the office, which I need."
2,Cheap.,"I used this thing forever, and it always fell off. I don't think that's the fault of the product so much, but it only has 4 mounting points and that didn't seem to be enough for average use.It's Also very flimsy and it wobbles like crazy. The mouse tray is a joke, it will not support your wrist's weight.Screwing the thing on was also a nightmare, the L brackets were used to mount the slides to the table, and you couldn't screw the slides all the way in because the screws would block the tray from sliding in, but having them so far out made screwing the unit to the table such an annoyance, and I had to do it a lot since it always fell off.I think the fact that I could stretch the slides out to find new mounting holes is just further evidence how flimsy this thing is.I would not suggest it."
5,wonderful addition at incredibly low price,"A co-worker, under my supervision, was instructed by her Dr. that if she wanted to relieve her back pain she must improve her posture and stop ""hunching"" over her desk 40 hours a week just to reach her keyboard. I, being the awesome boss that I am, went to Amazon immediately and searched keyboard tray. Amazon came up with just what I was looking for. I purchased three keyboard trays @ $23.00 each, one for each of us. Easy to install, durable and Dr. ordered. Way to go Amazon for once again, making life so much simpler!!"
3,Fix for mouse tray,"I bought this keyboard tray in order to fit a limited mounting space. Immediately I noticed the give in the mouse tray. While trying to find a solution, we discovered that a metal ruler wedged underneath in the slots did the trick. It hasn't bothered me since. Give it a try!"
2,Arrived broken,"I thought I wanted an inexpensive keyboard tray. It arrived already broken, and the plastic was of such lightweight quality that I decided it wasn't worth trying another. I ended up spending quite a bit more for a very nice 3M KP200LE and am very happy."
4,Good Fellowes Keyboard Drawer,Easy installation. Good price. It helps to make room for my desktop as planned. Now typing on keyboard feels so much comfortable because the keyboard is located in the right place.
5,best at the price,"at this price, you will not find a more stable, quality drawer. Just make sure to line up the rails perfectly"
4,"a bit flimsy, but good value for the price","a bit flimsy, but good value for the price. the pull out mousepad is a nice feature to have included"
5,keyboard for small office. Good,It's easy to install. It's functional and solid and good office look. My employees liked it and I had installed 4 of them.
5,perfect,"A very good buy, I can now use an antique desk as my computer station. The installation was not as easy as I had hoped, but that was due to the desk, not the product."
5,Exactly what I wanted and needed!!!!,"Between my job and my love of my computers, my right shoulder takes a lot of stress and has become bursitis-prone. The need to lower the keyboard from a desk top that wasn't at an ergonomically friendly height became paramount. The Fellowes Keyboard Drawer was just the ticket. Inexpensive and yet with the all important mouse tray that others did not have. I installed it myself along with a big assist to the template provided by the mfg. Would definitely recommend to anyone....I noticed an improvement in my shoulder and neck immediately."
3,Fellowes UnderDesk Keyboard drawer,Bolts were missing and bolts were also put into wrong places and had to be swapped in order to connect support arms.
5,Glides like buttah,This shelf easily glides in and out and is very comfortable. It is so much nicer than the one I replaced. I am very pleased.
3,"Seems good, but they didn't give me the screws!",The keyboard drawer appears to be solidly built and fairly well designed. However I can't test it in action because they didn't give me enough screws to install it!
5,love my keyboard tray,"Great product, meets my needs, good quality. Have used Fellowes product for years and they never disappoint; easy to install."
3,"Not rugged, broke after a year of use","Broke after a year of use, not very rugged. Then again, it's only $25-30 so what can you expect. Probably ok for moderate use, but for heavy daily use, look elsewhere."
3,"If price is a concern, choose this tray","The entire tray is plastic and feels very flimsy. When typing, the mouse will move around on the screen because of the flimsiness. I would only recommend purchasing this tray if you absolutely need a tray with a place for the mouse and price is a concern."
3,Weird ergonomics and no locking in position,"All in all this is a good purchase for the price.It does feel cheap, though the plastic is pretty high quality and so are the mounting brackets.The additional mouse area is also great.The main problems are:- Weird ergonomic design: the lip on the drawer is very tall which forced my wrists into a strange downward position while using the flat designed apple keyboard. The plastic on the mouse extension does not work well with optical mice.(I solved these issues by gluing a mouse pad to the mouse drawer and attaching a height extension to the main drawer).- The other major problem is that the drawer doesn't lock in place. This is a big problem since the keyboard drawer tends to withdraw back on its tracks when you use it."
2,SPEND A LITTLE MORE $$,Received my order for the Fellowes drawer yesterday and it is on its way back to Amazon. I'm going to spend a little more money and buy a product that isn't made out of plastic and arrives with a piece broken off of it. This obviously will not hold up well. My suggestion to anyone looking at this drawer: Spend just a little more money and buy better quality.
2,Good Price - Plastic not so much!,I didn't realize this drawer was like a kids toy. I thought it was metal or something a little more sturdy. I shipped to our customers site and was thoroughly embarrassed when I visited the site saw what they had received. I will take part of the blame for not investigating what this drawer was made of before purchasing it.
4,Overall happy with this device,"I work on a drafting table for my design work which basically puts my keyboard and mouse too high if I set it on the table surface. With this device, I was able to bring my keyboard and mouse to a more manageable height and my shoulders love it. And it freed my workspace for sketching or tablet work. I do wish that the mouse tray had some sort of lock on it, so that it would stop wandering back in during use. Also, I know it was not designed for this but, it just barely works with my Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000; I had to take off the keyboard retaining clip for the 4000 to fit in the tray.It has survived many countless hours of work and slamming from frustration."
4,"Works great, but it's not for ergonomic/curved keyboards","Installation was straight-forward. Yes, as others have pointed out, this is a plastic product, but it appears to be plenty strong for it's intended use.I like the fact that this drawer/shelf has an adjustable height to accomodate different height keyboards or different user preferences. It's plenty long, almost 2"" longer than my standard Dell keyboard. I used some Velcro tape on the bottom of the keyboard to keep it from sliding side-to-side. I attached my Logitech Trackball to the mouse shelf that same way.I had been hoping that the drawer would fit my Microsoft ergonomic keyboard, but that was a no-go. Before buying, make sure your keyboard will fit into the 20""W X 7-5/8""D keyboard well."
2,"Even with good care, it's just not worth it.","The chain fell off, repaired it, fell off again, repaired it, and it finally got lost somewhere. Kinda glad about that. No matter how you wash this or care for it though, it gives your tea a metallic taste. That shouldn't happen with a steel ball. I love my loose teas, but have been avoiding drinking them until I find something better."
1,Do not care for this product.,"Bought this for my daughter who drinks loose leaf tea. When she put the tea leaves in and put it in the hot water, much of the tea floated out through the holes which made the tea undrinkable. I can see maybe a few leaves coming through, but the amount that came through the holes was ridiculous!"
2,Not made well,Overall the design is ok but the seal is horrible and tea leaves get loose in your cup every time you use it. I would not reccomned this product.
1,Norpro Stainless Steel Tea Ball,Horrible design the edges were so sharp that it is a wonder I didn't slice my fingers!! Had my son try his hand at it and he agreed with me!! And it's almost impossible to get it apart then it's almost impossible to get it back together... my blood pressure would go sky high just trying to make tea !!!!
3,tea ball,doesn't like to screw together or apart very easily. don't get this if you have problems with opening things. perfect size to hold enough tea for a cup or two. quick shipping.
1,CANNOT OPEN!!! WHAT A RIP OFF!!!,"1 star is even too much. I bought this at a store that sells alot of natural products. I couldn't get this thing open. Is this a joke? I bought 2 of these. I even tried to use a sharp knife to open it and I couldn't. Someone else tried to open it and they couldn't do it either. I hurt my fingers and ended up breaking the chain too. Maybe the people who wrote good reviews got ones that can open. Lucky for them. So if anyone decides to buy one, just remember that you might get one that might not open and you'll end up wasting your money. BEWARE!!!"
1,Worthless,"Got these as part of a little gift-set. They are hard to open and close (especially closing after filling the tea), the twist close did not always produce a tight seal so you risk having loose tea in your mug. The chain broke off after the second use (not really that big of a deal, more inconvenient). After the third use it became so difficult to open I just threw it away."
1,Don't waste your time on this,My wife got one of these. Trying to open it was a nightmare. The chain broke off while we were trying to twist and pry it apart. Then once we had it open it wouldn't align to close.
2,no thanks,"not very convenient of a product, hard to clean and reuse. filter bags work much better for me."
2,Not a good product,"I've had this for several years now and don't know why it's taken me so long to replace it. I've put up with the fact that it doesn't screw on all the way, so pops open from time to time. Plus, the chain isn't long enough to keep from falling into my mugs and tea cups. I'm constantly having to fish it out with a spoon. Will be upgrading soon!"
4,Tea Infuser,"A little smaller than I thought I was getting, but worked fine. I used it to make spiced cider as well."
2,Not as expected,The mesh tea infuser that I had bought many years back is wearing off and so I bought another tea infuser. But this is not even half as good as the earlier one. The attached chain is very small. Its very difficult to open as well. Its size is bigger than expected. The holes are bigger than I thought they would be.
3,Stainless steel tea infuser,Product works ok. It got jammed closed and had a hard time getting it open again.
3,Not what I expected,I thought it looked fancier in the picture. I think I could have bought one just like it at the dollar store.
1,Terrible quality,"I don't usually write reviews, but this is probably the worst quality product I've ever purchased from Amazon. This product was apparently not made to get wet (since it's for tea) because it was completely rusted inside after first use. Never used again, but for the price not worth the hassle of returning it."
3,it's ok,"When I used this tea ball, there were some loose leaves that came out so you get some floaties in your tea. It's no big deal I guess."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,I had an order delivered from Amazon this afternoon. Sorry to say that this Norpro Tea Ball is already in the trash. I purchased it for a second tea ball. I spent over ten minutes just trying to separate the two sections. Trying to put it back together was not any easier. Also upon getting it open I discovered that the inside edges were quite sharp. A person could easily be cut by the edges especially with the excessive force needed to open and close it. I did not feel like bothering with returning it at the price it was sold for so I just tossed it in the garbage.
1,Unusable,The product is very difficult to work with. When I tried to use for the first time it was difficult to open this container and I have had this problem several times. Once you open the circular edges are sharp and lead to cut and bruises on your hands. The container is also difficult to clean on the inside.
2,The worst teaball ever!,"It took me two days of pushing, pulling, prying, and levering just to get the pieces separated (not to mention cutting my finger twice). Plus, the chain came off and one of the links fell off. I had to get out a pair of pliers to put the chain back together and squeeze the hook holding it on back into place.Just awful!"
1,Junk,The sides are easily cross threaded and then you can't get it apart without destroying it. It never even got a single use because it was jammed shut.
1,"Tea leaves leak out, don't buy","Thought this would be a great gift for my fiance who loves loose leaf tea, however the holes are big enough that small tea leaf particles will easily leak out. This can make tea taste bitter. I suggest getting another tea ball with smaller holes."
1,Not the best one out there,"When I got this tea infuser, I thought how bad can a tea infuser be? I learned quickly. The top is very difficult to put back on without spilling your tea, and unless you are steeping whole tea, finer tea leaves spill out through the holes. I ended up just using a coffee filter as a tea bag and throwing this in my drawer. I'll try using it again if I ever get some other teas with larger tea leaves, but until then, I rate this one as a dud."
3,just adequate,"This less expensive Tea Ball is great, when in your cup. Sadly pieces do not connect easily/smoothly. But, fine for the price."
1,Horrible,"This thing is a pain in the butt. Its hard to open and close, and the chain is flimsy. I much prefer the scissor style infusers."
5,Excellent!! Will buy again,"I got it in less than 48 hours, and is excellent! I've had no problems at all with the opening issue as I saw in some other reviews. Does a great great job. Will recommend highly to everyone."
5,"Funny,cool and fun.","Excellent fun, fantastic graphics, extremely cool make your way through many exciting different environments. If your'e wondering about the animated blood,it's when you kill giant ants and a bit of green guts comes comes out.I gave it four stars because it's very hard to beat and you need to do new game to replay old levels. I have had it for four months now and still haven't beaten it."
4,fun for all ages,"I have just started playing the game this week and so far I find it very enjoyable. Although, I am presently stuck trying to get across some energy bridges, it is fairly easy but still challenging. Also rented the movie version to get more of a feel for the story line."
3,Nice read,This book provided me with some helpful insights on certain aspects I overlooked in regards to IT managment. I was able to integrate some of this knowledge into my line of work.
2,bad translations to the GBA,These games do not translate well to the GBA. Only buy this if you are a huge fan of the games.
1,Another terrible DSI Games release,"DSI Games released a jillion of these arcade or board game compilation carts for the GBA. If Spy Hunter / Super Sprint is any indication, then they're all rush-jobs slapped together with no regard for quality. That sure would explain why there are so many of them..."
2,I think my sister would like this book,"I do not like to write reviews on books but I feel I need to in this case. I bought this book solely on the customer reviews. I mean it was rated with 5 stars and I said to myself this has to be a great book to get such a high rating. I looked and authors of books that I have enjoyed have not had a rating that high.The Davinci Code only has 3 & !/2 stars. The Firm has 4 !/2,the Winner by Baldacci has 4 stars and By the light of the Moon has 3 &1/2. I could go on about this (and I know"" beauty is in the eye of the beholder"")Anyway I was looking forward to a ""good read"" and I could not even finish the book. I think these authors have potential but they have to work a little harder at it This book never kept my interest and I found it predictable. I will say that my sister reads maybe one book a year and I do think she will enjoy it. This is not the kind of book for a person that loves to read."
2,Very uneven,"Once you get past the 20s the book dries up, until you get to the 80s and a section that must have been written by Guliani's p.r. firm. The writing is not good (how many times can the author say someone died of ""lead poisoning?"") and the editing matches the writing. If you are not from New York, and want to know anything about the Mafia from 1930-1985, than this book is not for you."
2,Great look at the Black Hand/White Hand Wars...but falters.,"The first part of the book deals with the clashes between the Italian gangs and the Irish gangs of New York during 1900-30 and does a pretty good job. Unfortunately, the second part of the book offers only brief glances at the rise of the modern Cosa Nostra as brought about by Luciano et al, culminating in Gotti's ascension to capo of the Gambino family. From 1930 on, lacking in details and out of date."
3,Prejudice ruined this book,"This story would be extremely valuable to society were it not for the prejudiced attitudes of its author portrayed through the protagonist. The writing is often wonderful, and the story is painfully real, but did Geri (the narrator) have to be so hateful toward Christians? I wouldn't have a problem with Geri simply being an atheist, but this book all but openly promotes prejudice towards people who happen to believe differently from the author. The only people who are Christians in this book are people who Geri (and the reader) take an instant dislike to. They are portrayed as being foolish and unable to think for themselves. Scoppettone seems to think this kind of bigotry is okay, and unfortunatly hatred toward Christians is acceptable in certain circles of society. I'm just really disappointed in any books that make it seem like it's okay to be bigoted toward any group of people."
5,Hit Close To Homw,"Being a teenage alcoholic myself, this book captured all the exact features like the writer lived it. It does indeed warn about the dangers of alcoholism, but brought back many a memeroies and sips of the bottle. I would 100% recommend it."
3,Roland MC-909 DVD Owner's Manual,"The manual was ok, but still needed more insight on the prouduct.maybe Roland should produce a second manual on the MC 909 with music produces that use there product."
3,Unfamiliar songs,"Having worked in Sunday School for 5 year olds before, none of the songs (maybe 1) were familiar at all, and the tempos didn't really appeal to my 1 1/2 year old son who loves singing and dancing. Maybe it's just us but we don't really pick up this CD or book to sing much now. Much more mileage was obtained from theWee Sing Bible Songs (Wee Sing) CD and Book Editionwhich we still use for bedtime jollies - my son can sing quite a few songs from that version already, but not one from More Bible Songs.No complaints about the CD itself, the songbook quality, or the voices chosen - if you find these songs familiar, they're actually great to have."
3,Not my cup of tea. Maybe yours.,"I am a dedicated Zelazny fan; have been since I was a kid. I loved most of his books, until I hit this one. To me, it is just too precious and forced. He came up with great ideas, way before his time, the way a really excellent Scifi/fantasy writer does. His imaginative and delightful phraseology just fights to get through this one. I got through it, but had to struggle with it. Will keep it, because his lesser writing is better than most writers' good work. Have not read the other reviews, but someone probably provided a synopsis. This was not my cup of tea, but Amber and Coils were a whole banquet."
3,The Petit Appetit Cookbook,This cookbook has lots of easy nutritious recipes to make for a child and to enjoy as an adult. I will definitely tell other parents about this book.
3,Nice but too simple,"This is a nice book with good background. Problem to me is that the 'recipes' are mostly one ingredient dishes where you simply steam or saute... Why would I need a book for that? I also have Annabel Karmel's 100 Purees book and that one has more creativity, helping one start to blend different things together. Most of the recipes in tThe Petit Appetit are things you could do yourself- steam the vegetable, add a little oil or spice, puree. Much too basic."
2,Too many basic recipes and salt ans sugar,"This book offers too many very basic recipes. You don't really need a recipe to make cauliflower, green bean etc. puree. It's just cooking and pureeing. In addition there are a lot of recipes that use salt and sugar even in the recipes for six month olds. The variety of ingredients used for every stage is also very limited. Overal there are better books like Cooking organic and reciped by gina ford."
4,You don't have to be completely organic,"I can't afford all organic food right now, so I just buy the ordinary stuff which works just fine. I really enjoy using this book. Her directions for the food prep, with different options are helpful when you don't have much time to devote to the process. The recipes encourage me to not be afraid to let my baby try new things. I hope that by trying out a new recipe every few days, this will help my baby not become as big of a picky eater as her dad! Only issue: watch out for allergies. Read up on what not to feed your baby somewhere else, that incorporate that into your meal plans."
3,Average cookbook.,I think that if I bought this when my daughter was 4 months I might have enjoyed it more. She is 12 months and I was looking for more ideas for her meals. I was disapointed.
3,so-so recipes,This had great reviews but I haven't yet found a recipe I liked from here. The book was a good read and I loved the push for organic. The baby biscotti called for a lot more sugar than I would give my baby at such a young age.
3,Salt?!,"The writer suggest to add pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to one of her recipes...?? Hello, are these baby recipes or a cookbook for adults?! Please use common sense if you have or are about to buy this book! And please no honey before the age of 1!"
3,revisions needed,"This book confuses Vegan and Vegetarian. The icons are reversed. Vegan icons are used for recipes that use yogurt, eggs, honey, etc. This should have been caught before going to press."
4,Great help!,I just got this book! the truth is that this book is great help for parents of kids over 6 months... the 4-6 months is SO basic its not needed... but hte rest is great! i am happy i got it and would recomend it to other friends!
2,Overall Disappointment,"I did not find this book particularly helpful. I was disappointed and surprised by the contradictions I found in this book. For example the author clearly states, ""Never feed a child less than one year honey"". However, in a recipe that she claims is appropriate for a 9-12 month old baby, she lists honey as one of the ingredients. The author lists several foods under ""Foods To Avoid"" like wheat, soy, and egg whites because they are potential allergens. However, these ingredients are used liberally in her recipes (for babies as young as 6 months) and there is no recommendation or instructions on how to introduce these potential allergens to your baby singly before you serve it to him/her in a complex recipe.These contradictions make me question the rest of the instructions and advice in this book. The author has no medical or dietetic background (at least none listed in the ""About the Author"" section). There is also a lack of citations from medical professionals."
3,"Great for Babies, Not so Much for Toddlers","This has been my go-to book for feeding my baby. Filled with great and easy recipes with multiple ways to prepare them (we don't have a steamer, every recipe comes with a way to prepare it in the microwave). As a mom who works outside the home, this was a great cookbook for all my baby food. And then my son started eating ""big kid"" food and the recipes fell short, big time. There were mostly cookies and side dishes my son refused to eat. This book failed with transition and toddler food."
4,"Good, yummy recipes, easy to make",Recipes that will grow with my child. Some really yummy ones for adults too!
4,"Truly easy, yummy cookbook","This is a wonderful book to get you through from babyhood to childhood and beyond. The veggie pancakes are as beloved by my 1 year old as by my husband. She identifies each recipe with symbols, wheat-free, vegetarian, etc. And the recipes are simple, don't require unusual ingredients or tools, and are really yummy. The ones I've tried are also easy to adjust, like I omitted the egg from the veggie pancakes and they work just fine!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book to inspire me to cook something tasty for my 21 month old. He likes fruits, veggies, but dislikes meat in general. He's definitely a good eater, and enjoys most foods and is an adventurous eater by most standards. I tried a number of recipes from this book, not all a success. Cereal batons were dry, bland, and the quantity resulted from the recipe was enormous. I threw it away after I realized how gross it tasted. I also made some kind of cheddar broccoli balls, also tasted gross and bland, and I followed her recipe! The pumpkin polenta was also nasty. She wants you to use all organic ingredients, as if that would make the recipes taste better! Some other ok dishes were the cauliflower gratin and the curried peas. Her veggie chili was the best in my opinion (for me, my son did not like the beans at all). There are too many recipes for polenta and very few recipes with rice. Overall, not too happy that we didn't find anything we really liked here."
4,Great Cook Book,"My daughter recently began table foods and I constantly use this book to create new food purees for her. The recipes are simple and delicious. I would eat anything I have served her so far and know that this will continue to be the case. The recipes are interesting, nutritious and not that labor intensive at all. If you are willing to put in a little time in your kitchen for the healthies meals you could ever prepare for your little one than this is a good place to start!"
5,Great cookbook,"I love this book for my 11 month old daughter. I wish I would have ordered it when I first started her on solids. I really like the lay out by age group. There are also symbols by each recipe that represent special diet needs that your baby my need (such as dairy, eggs, wheat, vegan, or vegetarian) which I love because my daughter has a dairy intolerance. It makes finding recipes for her quick and easy."
3,Very general study,"The book is a good start for anyone who wishes to learn something about the evolution of the structure of the US Army Divisions from their inception in 1911 until 2000, but it lacks the depth and the detailed analysis. The reader finishes the book in a few hours and although he receives a good synopsis he finds himself having many questions and not the answers. For a far better perusal on the subject look to Wilson's masterful work ""Maneuver and Firepower: The Evolution of Divisions and Separate Brigades""."
2,Nice idea but.....,I thought they were just too sweet. If you really like sweet sweet things you may like it.
5,Best taste,"Used to have Detor bars, gave these a try, better taste, smaller size, no after taste, 90 less calories, 1 less gram of Saterated Fat"
2,Not Impressed,"It seemed like a cool book when i was flipping through it, but upon reading it... it didn't seem so great (all the sexual postions seemed like the stuff I was doing in the seventh grade) so don't buy it with the expectations of turning into a human pretzel with your lover..."
1,i did not like it,"it was not what i was looking for, it was in good shape and said what it was, to bad it did not do a thing for me."
3,mediocre book,I wasn't entirely impressed w/this book. I had expected more but much of it is common knowledge and for those w/an imagination.
4,The Game,"This Game is ""one of a kind"". If u love staraties and air combat then you'll love this game. Its packed with tons of weapons and different kinds of ships. You first start out as little ship but as u keep learning more and more about it then thats were it gets FUN, because the more u know the better. You'll learn about differen't weapons and become the ultimite fighter of air combat. So take my word for it and go and get this game. Im sure you'll love this game."
5,Classic game - loads of fun!!,"The first time I played Stratosphere was more than a decade ago. I was immediately hooked. Time went by and I completely forgot about the game. Recently I was reminded about it, and found it on Amazon super cheap. It brought back great memories. Very nostalgic! Stratosphere is highly addicting, and very creative and original. Find the cheat codes online to unlimited funding and you can build colossal ships. Mix and match weapons and upgrades for hours. Writing this review actually makes me want to play it now..."
5,Great if you love modern art,"A true gem. Not that big, but focuses on his best works. Very good for students doing reasearch and art lovers alike. Beautiful illustration"
5,A Great Game For My Granddaughter and I to Enjoy,I purchased this game collection for my 9 year old granddaughter for Christmas. I remember watching my brother play this game many years ago. She absolutely loved Centipede and it is just as I remembered from back in the day. The colors are very vibrant.She has yet to figure Warlords out and Breakout is just as I remember it. Overall I would say that this game is well worth the money we paid for it.
2,How entertaining can three 20 year old games be?,This triple release was a bargain I found in the local super store. I was entertained for a solid hour. After that time I became frustrated with the mechanics of these games on the Gameboy Advance and DS.The main menu starts with a nostalgic view of these three games.Breakout does not store high scores once the cartridge is powered off. The refresh rate for the pong style ball is choppy.Users can choose from five custom backgrounds which are not appealing.Centipede does not store high scores once the cartridge is powered off. The highlight of this game are the 5 retro backgrounds for the game.Warlords cannot store high scores.Pros:1) Good for one hour of mindless button pushing.Cons:1) Old games that are not appealing when compared to other titles available for the Gameboy Advance platform. I suggest trying Wolfenstein or Doom for the Gameboy if you like classic games.2) Retro music soundtrack was poorly made.
3,Terrible Kindle Format,I downloaded this to my kindle today and was amazed at the poor quality. It was like looking at a .pdf at 50% sizing. So I would highly recommend you try the sample first of the book before paying for it. Hopefully your device won't have the same problems as mine.
4,Courageous Acknowledgement of Man's Inhumanity to Man!,"Anne Frank lives-in spirit. One of the strongest and certainly youngest chronicler of the holocaust. She is such a heroine role model for today's confused youth. A ""must see"" VHS and please don't forget a book or other readers/media by the same title. Great for discussion beginning with 10 years olds through middle school. (Not just for girls as Elie Wiesel is not just for boys). ""Live life"", is the message I get and if you must suffer it than do it with class and even with a sense of curiosity and adventure. And, when you die there will be a definite sense of history waiting for you. Or, should I say an infinite sense of having been and is that not the same as immortality?"
1,Carole Landis should be treated better then this,"While Behind Green Lights is a very good movie, this DVD is not. It is a shame that a Carole Landis film has fallen to this disarray and people actually selling it in this poor condition. Whats even worse, is that the ""download"" available from Amazon, is the exact same horrible copy."
4,"Carole, always best!","Not the best movie ever made, and was probably beneath Carole to take a part for, but she as always lights up the screen whenever she's on camera! She's one of the most talented, most beautiful, and most sexy of all the actresses of the 1940's!"
3,"Good read, horrible formating (Kindle edition)","I am a big Iris Johansen fan and I have also enjoyed her books co-written with Roy and when I saw Deadly Visions I had to give it a go.The story is well put together and the characters are interesting enough to keep things rolling though it is not the quality that you find in more seasoned writers... (it is ironic that I should say that because I could not write a novel to save my life)If you are looking to get this for your Kindle I would pass and go borrow it from the library. The formatting is horrible, wordsruntogether, and it looks like it is a bad OCR scan since words like ""well"" become ""we11"" and the like.If you can get the paperback I say go for it, you will enjoy it. If you are going to read it on the Kindle... pass"
2,disappointing,"Like the previous reviewer, I read this in one sitting. That's only because it's a quick read, not because it is particularly compelling.Once the mystery is solved, you realize everyone except maybe the Illuminati was involved in one way or another. Whatever. Once the cast of characters got that complicated, I lost interest."
3,Iris Johansen's son,"Just reading on IJ's site and noticed her son Roy had a first book out. Always interesting to see children of best selling authors writing on their own.I haven't read this yet. I had to give it a rating to get this note up, so I picked ""3"".SCD"
3,just as pictured,"We used two of these in my daughter's room to cover her 80"" wide window. They are easy to hang on a curtain rod and look nice. We changed the ties to pink polka-dot ribbon. I could not have made them for anywhere near what I paid for them. They are a fantastic value."
2,Don't buy this CD unless you are addicted to ska-reggae,"I am very, very disappointed. I got this box set because my collection lacked reggae-ska, and it had some big-name reggae stars (Bob Marley). But it turns out to be mostly a rip-off ska-reggae collection of no use. Most of it, including the Bob Marley tunes, is second-rate, cast-off cuts. Disc 1 is completely useless. Looks to me like these folks bought up lots of cut-rate songs and put them into one box set to sell to suckers (like me). Don't bother!!!"
1,This CD should be called Liar of of Ska Roots,"I thought I was adding some decent music to my collection. At the worst I thought I would try this sampler. [...]. I don't even think the The Specials on here are the real Special. If you need proof, listen to Bob Marley fussing and fighting. Listen to your version then this to this piece of [...] that I have no idea of what it is. Studio outakes maybe. Save your money."
2,GUMBY ROCKS OUT OF CONTROL,The movie arrived when it was supposed to.My son enjoys the movie although I don't think that the soundtrack is very child friendly as it's overly loud with screaming rock guitars. We have the gumby essentials dvd which contains episodes from the 1950's- 1980's and that's a better purchase in my opinion.
3,Gumby Returns!,"I am probably the biggest Gumby fan alive. I was a member (proudly) of The Gumby Fan Club back in the mid 80's when Gumby was on Channel 5 and 9. He disapeared for a long time. I was in college when I saw that ""Gumby:The Movie"" was playing, and was sorry that I couldn't see it on the big screen.I didn't rent it- I bought it ASAP! Great for kids, and die hard fans, but too long and it doesn't know when to quit. Still it's hard not to love Gumby.Magical, as Gumby enters the story books and meets adventure at everyturn. You'll see scenes re-created by Gumby and Pokey from ""Star Wars"", and ""Terminator"". Why this didn't come out in the 80's when Gumby was riding high, is a mystery. Still, I'm glad Gumby finally made it to the big screen. Not for everybody's taste."
2,Awful,I'm glad I'm a Amazon Prime member cause i didn't have to pay for this garbage. I remember watching the tv show and it was so much better. This movie was just boring. Bad plot and story line. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
2,Not Family friendly,"It should not be placed under ""kids and family"" too much slicing and cutting etc. It is a scary kind of movie and more suited for older kids. Not recommended for kids under 9 years old."
3,My 18 year old wasn't very amused.,"Although I seem to remember Gumby was something everyone watched when I was little my 18 month old and 8 year old were not really amused. I got the ""are you for real, Dad!?!?"" look. Other than that... who knows may it is just mine."
1,"SCRAM!, Scram","I am doing research for a fiction book and found ""Scram..."" to be outdated and patronizing. It barely gives an overview for those seriously needing help but it could be used as a primer. If you need details, this isn't the book."
3,The 8 missing episodes...,"This set contains only 16 of 23 episodes. The 8 missing episodes are:- Rub Three Times For Desaster (featuring a genie)- Lex Luthor Strikes Back- Space Knights of Camelon (featuring King Arthur)- The Lord of Middle Earth (!)- Universe of Evil- Terror at 20,000 Fathoms (featuring Captain Nemoy ;))- The Superfriends Meet Frankenstein- The Planet of Oz (!)Some of these episodes featured crossovers and might have tangled copyright issues (Tolkien, Land of Oz, Frankenstein, King Arthur) so I ask myself whether this is the reason they are missing in this release? It's a pity this set isn't complete."
5,Superfriends:Super Memories,I watched these episodes as a kid and nearly 30 years later I enjoyed them all over again as a married adult. The storylines are all the same and the drawings are crude compared to today's Justice League but what makes this a great DVD is the dialogue. The voices go with each character especially the voice of Batman. This is a wonderful way to bring the Superfriends to your kids both young and old.
3,For your information...,"The people who are saying that these episodes are from 1977(or 1978)are wrong. These episodes are from the 1979 season ""The World's Greatest Super Friends"". Except this DVD release only has 16 of the 23 episodes aired that season. Why they did not include the whole season on this DVD is anyone's guess."
3,Incorrect Description,"Unfortunately, my kids were disappointed upon receiving this dvd. They were expecting the series that contain the characters of Wendy and Marvin and Wonderdog. Instead, it has Jayna and Zan.Please correct your description of this item, so people buy what they are really looking for."
4,"How I see it!...Superfriends, Volume Two (DC Comics Classic Collection) Blue Box","This version of the Super Friends is minus the Hall of Doom, and minus any supervillains. They battle electric monsters and tar monsters. It is NOT nearly as good as the BEST Super Friends series 'Challenge of the Super Friends', however, I like it because I watched it on Saturday mornings with a big bowl of cereal, so the quality is not all that important to me. Get 'Challenge of the Super Friends' FIRST, then if you don't mind a more silly version with less Super Friends, then rent this one from the library/video store and see if you like it. For me, it reminds me of being a kid, and I love that!"
3,Not the set I thought it was.,"Based on the design of the box AND by several reviews, I thought this was The Challenge of the Super Friends season 2, but it's not. It it just the earlier seasons of Super Friends Vol. 2, so if that is what you are looking for then there ya go. I Found the earlier stuf very cheesey, but the Callenge of the Super Friends had better characters and scenarios."
5,Nostalgic!,"As soon as I ordered this I couldn't wait to receive it. I plopped it right in and watched every episode in a single day. The price was a great deal, too! If you're considering getting this, be sure to get the 1st season if you don't own it already!"
4,Super Friends,While these particular issues of Super Friends are not up to the story quality of a Batman toon they are worth watching and some individual stories are up to expectations.
5,Better Than Anything Currently on TV,"I came across Murder in Suburbia while browsing in my local library because, while television at any given time is sadly lacking, it's especially barren in the summer. What a pleasant surprise! My only regret is the apparently limited run of this series. I can't remember the last time I sat back & actually watched a dvd without having to fill in the boring parts with flipping through a magazine. The characters work well together, not only the main characters, but supporting also. Writing well done also. It was wonderful to just relax and be entertained."
3,it's ok,"I thought the plots were decent, although not very complex. The two females leads should be refreshing and interesting but the one called Ash had a hairstyle that was so awful it was just distracting and always had a dour expression, I just couldn't get into her character. Aside from that it was a bit too campy not dark and suspenseful if that is what you're looking for."
3,"No closed captions, no subtitles.","This is a collection of short episode mysteries with girlish detectives. Very disappointingly, yet not unexpected for a British series, there are no closed captions nor English subtitles. Apparently the British give the hard of hearing short shrift."
2,Interesting buy not great.,I ordered this because I liked Caroline Catz in the Doc Martin series and Lisa Faulkner in general. I was greatly disappointed with these mysteries and the performances. The images are too graphic for the story lines. The two series were expensive and not worth what I paid for theme.
2,Even the British can be dull....,"Not an interesting, typically well done British series. Save yourself....no charima here."
1,Shallow ...,"I did not enjoy this. If you like 'Hercule Poirot', 'Miss Marple', 'Morse', 'Frost' or even 'Jonathan Creek', ... - then you won't like this shallow series. Maybe I am too old for this - but two goodlooking women are not quite enough to make a good mystery ..."
1,Absolutely NOT recommended,"We should have been much more careful and read other customers' negative reviews on this crib mattress pad before purchasing three of them (eventually cancelled one). We would not recommend this item.After only one wash (despite having followed the laundry instruction), it shrank so much that it became impossible to fit our standard crib. When I tried to stretch the sides around the mattress, they tore..."
1,"Doesn't fit mattress after 1 washing, very disappointed","Like others have noted, this pad will not fit standard crib mattresses, and it shrinks considerably after a single washing. It was short on the sides and does NOT have ""deep pockets"" as claimed. Nice top quilted material, but it is absolutely useless because it won't fit our crib. What a waste of money. Also, the seams started to come apart after a single wash. Sealy needs to improve this product."
4,"Unnecessarily small, but ""natural"" quality is worth it","Even straight out of the package this mattress cover does not properly fit a Sealy brand baby-posteurpedic type mattress (""properly"" being the normal safety recommendation of fully around all sides plus two extra inches underneath). It does fit on our mattress, which is several inches deep, and has never been a concern to come off and pose a hazard.Washing on gentle cycle in cold water has not changed anything--still fits after a year and a half. We have NEVER put it into a dryer, which may be part of the problem for those who claim it fails to fit at all after laundering.I'm strongly considering purchasing a second one--just can't find anything comparable for the price that does not have plastic or vinyl components of some sort..."
2,Too small,"I loved this mattress pad when I first opened it, it's made of soft, natural cotton and offers a nice cushion for baby. However, after washing it, I found it's too small for the crib mattress, which is a standard size. I think they just skimped on material, or didn't pre-wash. It's a good 2 inches too short! It doesn't have much stretch to it, so I'm afraid I won't be able to use it all! Very disappointing."
3,Not what I expected,"I thought that this video would get me sweating like she did in her other video (which I can't remember the name of) but it falls a little short. Yes, it does make you sweat while you are doing it but once you stop, you cool down rapidly and don't feel like you had a good enough workout. There is too much weightlifting and lunges and not enough cardio in between to keep the heart rate up. I'm assumed that since it's called cardiosculpt there would be more cardio in it. I definitely see the sculpting part in the video, and it it makes up most of it. I haven't done this video in about a week and a half because I don't feel like I sweat enough. I only do it when I get tired of my other video or when I don't feel like exerting as much as I usually do."
5,Good Stuff,"I have been using Venastst for years. It has made a rremarkable difference in how my legs look and feel. yet, I only take one capsule a day, not the recommended 2 a day."
5,Good Stuff!,"Sorry, I don't really know how to write a review for this product. I believe it's doing the job it's intended to do. I don't have leg vein problems, or any other kind of vein problems."
3,First Aid 2000 works good - WITH a patch,"After first installation, numerous 32-bit errors appeared. On my own, since e-mails to McAfee were not answered to satisfaction, I found a patch on their web site which fixed the bug. If you buy this program and have Internet Explorer 5.0 you WILL have to get the patch if version number of First Aid is 6.0. Now--- with the patch the program does perform alright (considering cost). The biggest plus is the crash protector which has gotten me out of a few jams. Although this is OK, you are probably better off spending more for a more comprehensive and more stable program."
1,Boring,"This movie is boring and if you want to get it for some young reletive/family member they would enjoy it. However sooner or later they would hate it. Get a movie that anyone would enjoy of any age. Maybe movies such as the Little Mermaid, Shrek, Toy story 1 and/or 2. Im 16 years old and movies that I enjoy that I liked to watch areany diysny movies My all time favorite is Dysneys Robin Hood. But And Nickolodien movie would uninterest any one in years to come."
1,Doug is the worst & the movies boring,"Doug is the Worst.Its a no doubt about it because the story tells only about Dougs dog saving the mayors daughter from a thin ice area.The darn girl should have not gone on it.Guess what happened when the dog was trying to save her?The darn mayor called a lawsuit cause HE thought the dog was trying to bite her daughter but when she fell again,the dog saved her and is the hero! The story is Mentioned with Doug when the dog was the hero!This storys absolutely boring so please dont help yourself with boring videos you wont even watch cause nickelodeon alreaady popular so why bother with somthing boring. You dont have to waste your time reading this anyway cause dougs boring."
4,Samia Magueem is a beautifully talented poet,"I enjoyed the work in, ""Visions of the soul"", throughout. I was touched by the sentiments in Samia's poetry about love, loss, and loneliness. One such line reads, ""Can I steal from you this world/ -and kiss you with my soul?"" I recommend this volume to all poetry lovers.*******Sarah playleThe Distance Between Ushttp://www.geocities.com/splayle"
5,Visions that sheds light on the darkness,The poetry in this book is truly an insight into the depths of ourselves. It is a journey that shedslight into the dark and unexplored or unknown side of our own soul.Amazing. and Remarkable book. Read it and find out ....
1,"Awful, not recommended","The purse is not as pictured. It is so disappointing, I will not give it to my 3 yr old daughter."
1,Pure disappointment,Buyer beware for the purse you will receive won't be the pretty bag in the posted picture. We received a very cheap version of the bag that I am too embarrassed to give as a gift. This is false advertisement. We are very disappointed.
1,A good idea gone bad! Forget it!,"Schaum's ""Russian Vocabulary."" This is supposed to a text in vocabulary building for everyday situations. However, the authors/publisher really missed the proverbial boat: There are no accent marks for any of the words in this book! The book title should be ""We'll Show You What the Words Look Like in Print, But We Won't Tell You How to Pronounce Them Correctly."" Any student of Russian knows how unpredictable the stress of Russian words is. It's really a rather nasty little joke to sell you a vocabulary book without the accent marks. You would have to look each word up in a dictionary to find out how to say it -- an impossible task. Ironically, accent marks are included in Schaum's Russian Grammar book. In short, this book is totally useless for learning new vocabulary unless you want to risk putting the accent on the wrong syllable (and perhaps totally changing the meaning of the word). What were they thinking!"
2,A place to start.,"Schaum's Outline of Russian Vocabulary would be useful to a student during the very earliest introduction to Russian. This book's material is duplicated in other introductions to the language. An advantage of these outlines is the large number of excersises for practice, all with answers."
1,Echoing the others,"I read the other reviews and thinking Amazon probably had a batch with printing errors, I found the same book at a brick and mortar competitor and, sure enough, no accent marks on a single page. Obviously a publisher printing error, right? Kind of makes the book useless."
4,Definitely recommendable,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that this book requires a pretty solid knowledge of Russian grammar and vocabulary - but this is exactly why I like it. As an advanced learner, it seems to be more difficult to find learning material that is demanding enough to take you further. Especially when you've been dealing with newspaper articles and written language most of the time and didn't have enough exposure to the vocabulary used in everyday situations. The authors do a very good job of presenting various ways of using the new vocab (i.e. three different sentences with a slightly different way of using a word/expression); there are a lot of exercises, and there is the necessary repetition and reoccurrence of learned vocab that helps it stick."
4,A Great Start,"I purchased several of these books to lead a spiritual formation group in my parish. The book has helped my people share their faith and their struggles in that faith. It has also introduced them to the concept of accountability, which is always good.The only problem that I encountered is the tremendous amount of oral reading required for each lesson. Some of my folks are self-conscious about their reading skills and as you take turns reading, it can be laborioius. Other than that, I would highly recommend this workbook to anyone wanting to go deeper in their spiritual life."
5,Great resource,"I loved the ""homework"" assignments that this book had. They kept our group accountable each week, but each person could tailor the homework to fit their personality and walk with Christ. This was a great resource for our small group, and a good overview of the different spiritual disciplines."
4,Small Group Ideas,"I am using many of the ideas for a new small group at our church. The provides a 9-10 plan for a small group with plenty of support for a novice leader and good ideas for those with more experience. How my people will adapt to and adapt from these idea we'll see. I have enjoyed reading it and pulling fresh ideas from it! Now, to put it into practice shortly!"
5,anything like its older brother,"If this one is anything like its precedessor with the five traditions, this study of the six traditions will be equally fruitful for Bible Study Groups. Especially with groups that need to labor in the work of the ministry over studying methods and actually do ministry."
1,Not a good source of information,"I was not too pleased with this so called ""guide"" book. Most of the places mentioned did not really accept dogs. I payed [$$] for this book thinking it would be loads of helpful tips and info. about dog places in NYC. But I didn't find that to be the case at all..BOOK IS USELESS..NOT WORTH BUYING.."
2,Would not reccomend..,"I had purchased this book in good faith, hoping I could find places in NYC that would take me and my sweet dog. 5 out of the 10 places mentioned in the book that were dog ""friendly"" did not take dogs.. It was a bit embarassing. I had told them about the book and they told me it was a mistake. That the author should have never put their location in the book and it was done without their permission..Anyway, I thought I was getting a reliable reference guide..Instead I got a book with alot of misinformation..WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.."
1,Disappointing...,"I got this book as a stocking stuffer for Christmas because I kept complaining to my friends how difficult it was to find places in NYC that were dog friendly. Anyway, Max and I read through the book and decided to visit the places that were mentioned as dog friendly. As soon as we walked through the door, we were quickly told that no dogs were allowed. So we decided to go to the next place on the list..And again, we were told no dogs were allowed..Well we would have gone for a third place, but after being ""rejected"" twice, Max's feelings were getting bruised..and so was mine. I relied on this book for giving accurate information on dog friendly places, but was quite disappointed."
1,This book is completely useless...,I would not recommend this book to my worse enemy. It's awful and very useless. What was the author thinking!!
3,very interesting but somewhat a lil unbelieveable,"I thought the idea was exvellent, being sent through a portal to another world as punishment wow. But when you find out the truth, all the romance it doesn't add up. Why would anyone kill themslelf over something so stupid. Zama was so smart and had a great personality, but falling for a jock hmmm. I enjoyed this book but not one of my favorites, could have been written better"
4,A warm correspondence,"""Te beatum dico et dicam"" = ""I call you blessed and I always shall."" Thus Father Don Giovanni Calabria addresses C.S. Lewis at one point in their correspondence out of gratitude for his work as a scholar and author. Between 1947 and 1954, C.S. Lewis and Don Giovanni Calabria exchanged a series of letters, written in Latin, sharing their concerns with each other and encouraging each other to carry on in the work of God. There is real warmth of feeling on both parties parts, and even if you don't read Latin, you will enjoy the English translations of this exchange. After Father Calabria died in 1954, Lewis continued to correspond with his fellow priest Don Luigui Pedrollo through 1961. Moynihan did a fine job of rendering these letters into English vernacular, so that Lewis's distinctive style can still be detected even through the lense of translation."
5,Is there any Chinese version for this book?,"I'm here again. I don't know if anyone has ever translated it into Chinese, I'm sure many people will like the content of the book, especially young people, a Chinese version will make it convenient for more Chinese to read. I'm willing to translate it, I'm a junior student majoring in International Studies and taking an translation course. May I have a try? :) Another reason for my coming back again is that I left my email address wrong last time. Terribly sorry!"
5,Guido,"Excellent practical guide to intimacy and authentic, spontaneous living. e.e. cummings quote at the conclusion sums it up: ""to be nobody-but-yourself in a world thats doing its best, night and day, to make you like everybody elsemeans to fight the hardest battle any human being can fightand to never stop fighting"""
4,Great fit!,"This is a great case for the zire 72. Not only does it fit like a glove, but it is also built so that you can easily press the memo button. It also snaps halfway open at the back so that you can quickly take pictures and not have to worry about taking the whole pda out of the case. There is an opening at the top of the case so that you can plug your earphones in for listening ease, but the jack may detach occasionally in the beginning. Overall, I recommend this."
4,"A good book, (Mhwheehee!)","I like this book because the hero is very diffrent from the other redwall books. It all starts out when Tagg, (Real name is Deyna.) gets otter-napped by a clan of vermin and is raised by them. When he's older, he runs away, and goes out to seek his true family. It's a very good book, MHAHAHA!!!! (o.k I stink at being funny.)"
3,Taggerung Doesn't Cut It,"I have read all the Redwall Books except Triss, and I'll have to say that Taggerung wasn't one of my favorites. First of all, Sawney Rath didn't have the true qualities of a villain. A true villain would be someone like Tsarmina(Mossflower). I'm not even sure that he was the villain, because the story turned when he was murdered by Antigra's son. Then there was the amber fox, who was little more than a threat to Deyna. Deyna's journey was the only enjoyable part in this story. If you're looking for more of a bloodbath, try The Long Patrol."
5,Great book,"This fourth installment of Brian Jacques' Redwall series is very good. From the beggining all the way to the end is non-stop adventure. You never know what will happen next and once you do find out, the story takes another turn. This is what makes this book great. So if you haven't read Taggerung yet, what are you waiting for? Go out and get this great book!"
4,a fan who's read every book at least 3 times,A long but interesting book about an Redwall otter cub who's father was killed by a bowbeast.He was then taken as the Taggerung of a wandering Juska clan.He flees when the leader of the clan wants him to skin a living fox.
2,But they are all the same....,"Am I the only one who notices that Jacques' books/plot lines are all the same? I'm beginning to feel like I'm reading the same book over and over again with different character names. Maybe it's just me, but this is starting to wear thin."
2,Eh... Not his best,"I didn't mind this book... Though I have to admit, I almost dropped the book altogether after a vital character died. I mean, it was O.K., but it wasn't as... shall we say... exciting as his others. It was more emotional, but I guess no one's perfect. You can't say it was more mental, because the puzzles were PATHETIC, as I got them on the first try and that's a huge accomplishment for me. Personally, my favorite was Castaways of the Flying Dutchman, but of the Redwalls, I'd say Outcast of Redwall.Anyways, if you never liked the violence, try this one. If you liked the fighting or tougher puzzles, be advised to skip this book."
3,great book--but losing the Redwall touch,"I have been a fairly obsessive Redwall fan for a long time and I have read the whole seires multiple times. I must admit that I was disappointed with this one. I mean, yeah, it's a Redwall book and any Redwall book deserves at least 3 stars, but after reading some amazing books in the series like Salamandastron and Pearls of Lutra, this one just didn't cut it for me. I predicted the whole story after the fifth chapter, and the puzzles were the simplest of any Redwall book. Anyone who has read all the books could easily guess the ending. There wasn't even that much action, mostly tears and emotion.(bleh)Anyone who is sort of familiar with the Redwall series, this is a great book, but you would get the same package, if not better, by reading any of the others. This book is good, yes, but it does not have the touch that Brian Jaques used to have. Die-hard Redwall fans, don't even waste your time with this one."
5,"A beautful book and inspiring pictures , great book",A lovely book with wonderful pictures to inspire. I would highly recommend any book from this author and will find it a great aid in my painting.
2,Not my type,I did not enjoy this book very much. I couldn't get the whole story. But A California mystery sounds new.
5,A quick note,"The simple fact is that you either love this movie or hate it, there isn't much of a middle ground. I for one, love this movie more than any other, but that is my own opinion. If you don't like slowish movies, I suggest sticking to the Disney version of Pocahontas. Please, if you don't enjoy this movie, don't write such rude reviews."
1,power board dies early,My dream system has needed two unrelated repairs in the tree years I have owned it. Niether has been under warentee. The last costing $300.
2,GOOD SOUND - POOR QUALITY,"The sound produced by this system is awesome, but that's where the accolades end with the DAV-FR1. If you attempt to load more than one disk into the player all will jam resulting in an expensive service call. I have owned this unit for four years and this has happened to me twice. The remote is totally worthless and broke one month after purchase. Sony has set this up so that no universal or other remote can be programmed to work the unit. You must purchase a replacement remote at a cost of $60.00 from Sony. Recently, the power switch has gone bad and the player can't be turned off either with the faulty remote or the faulty switch. It must be unplugged from the wall.Would highly recommend staying away from this unit."
4,great thinking game,My daughter liked this game. It is a good game if you want to have a challenging game for your child. She did like Spy Alley much better. I would recommend Spy Alley first.
5,good dog door,"the dog door is everything the company offered. it installed easily and is working well. i've had trouble before with the flexible flaps in the cold, they can crack and break. this is my second magnador i've purchased and the first one is still going strong after 2 winters. no problems in the cold weather"
2,Cheap.,"Easy to install. That's the only good thing I have to say. There is nothing to this door. It's plastic. It has a small frame that doesn't seal well. The magnets at the bottom don't keep the door closed well....the slightest breeze keeps the flap open. When closed, you can see right between the flap and the frame...about a 2mm gap all the way around. Needless to say, not airtight in the least. There is only a frame for one side of the door. The other side ends up looking like a hole cut in the door...which it is, but it should at least have the edges covered."
5,Manual to Curb Southern Culture Shock,"In my work I train employees who are new to the South. I have referenced and recommend McGehee's book to people seeking answers to the important cultural questions.What is the history and origin of the Mint Julep?With a non-abrasive look at all things Southern, it is a classy addition to new employee training packets. Lifelong Southerners and first time visitors will enjoy McGehee's accessible, intelligent, and refreshing perspective on what he has seen."
3,The Orginal Pink Tape,I was disappointed with this tape but intend to try a wider tape. The one inch wide tape did not hold the ostomy wafer in place. I suspect the one inch was just too narrow for this type of use. This tape is well-thought of in the ostomy community and I intend to try it again. This is just a warning for people with stomas that one inch probably won't work and I will update the review after I try a wider version.
5,solar car,This car is great. Runs immediately on any light source. A bit smaller than I anticipated but a great toy.
3,"Okay, but a little flimsy.","Just purchased this because I though it was a good price. It's okay but not good for a 17"" laptop. It's a little flimsy and my laptop slides because both sides are very smooth hard plastic, not textured like the center. I'm giving it a try but I think I may give this one to my daughter and find a better one."
3,Laptop Riser,Keying at the proper angle really makes it easier to work on a laptop. Unfortunately this product raised the laptop too high to really justify the correct angle it provides. Only buy this product if you can raise your chair or lower your desk.
3,Laptop riser,this item serves it's purpose. It doesn't function well in the higher position because the laptop screen tends to lean forward.
3,Overpriced,"It's overpriced for a large, unstable piece of plastic that feels like it will break any minute. My laptop wobbles on the second to lowest height. Will be returning it to buy a second book stand that holds my laptop better than this."
5,GREAT ITEM TO HAVE,"My wife kept asking me to make her some sort of elevator so she wouldn't have to lean over the keyboard and, viola!, I found one already to go. Great item at at a great price."
4,"Pretty nice, could be a little better","It is simple, lightweight, attractive and easy to use. It would be ideal for those who spend their life on the road in particular. I do wish you could slide the monitor forward on the base and I wish it were more conducive to added cooling."
4,Not what I expected,"The stand is great, but not quite what I expected. There's a piece of plastic that sticks up to prevent the laptop from falling, as well as prevents me from getting to my CD/DVD drive. But it's something I can deal with.Great shipping time and everything"
2,Does the job...barely,"I've had this riser for a few years, and always regretted getting it and not getting something better. It does work for elevating your laptop, it's just cheap construction and poor design. Parts of it almost seem disposable. The rear piece that elevates the tray up or down is a small single plastic piece in the middle, and only supports the middle. So if the laptop is elevated, it's quite unstable and can rock left to right if moved. The front shield that keeps the laptop from sliding forward is pretty flimsy too, and I've often thought it might break if my laptop was heavier. Save your money and get something better."
1,"Flimsy, doesn't stay in its position","This laptop riser is very flimsy. It doesn't stay in its position when taking out or depositing the laptop. The indentations to set the riser level are not deep enough so the movements cause it to flip from its position. I use it with a Macbook, I'm in an office and out of meetings, so I come back to deposit the laptop 3-4 times a day and have to reset it most of the time.In addition, the plastic that holds the riser level is cheap, thin. I can see it won't last long. Overall, I don't recommend it."
3,qualtiy crimper,Makes good crimps. Requires more force to squeeze than I would like. There are others like those made by Paladin in the same price range that are easier to use and also make good crimps.
3,Keep you monney,"99% of the matresses that you find on the market are waterproof. Buy the matress first, then see if you need this."
1,annoying that they gave a new title to old works,"These were so-so novels when first published, but it is very annoying that there is nothing in the title or front cover that indicates that this is not a new novel co-writen by two authors but two separate old novels (Sarek and Spock's World) written separately. The cover is very, very deceptive. Shame on Signature edition. How hard is it to put out something new?"
5,"Rolando M. Barlaan, AIA","A well written book. Based on the architectural images provided in the book, it provides the reader a clear perception of architectural space and its environs. Although I have practiced architecture in the United States for over 28 years, I have been reminded again of what makes Philippine architecture unique. Architect Francisco Manosa captured the essence of indigenous tropical malay architecture and the only missing elements are the aromas coming from the kitchen and you feel you have actually lived in these houses. Congratulations on a well documented project and I wish Mr. Caruncho all the encouragement to continue writing on projects such as this."
4,Stops Short,"Abrams book has value, but he stops short in his epistemology of language. Animals do not have language; they have codes. The only animals who use language are depicted in cartoons and in places like Disney World.The author leaves out the philosophical progression from Husserl's phenomenology to that of Martin Heidegger. Heidegger declares that ""Language is the House of Being"". He was speaking of the being of human beings, not animals. A fundamental flaw with this thinking is that animals have shown no capacity or ability to reflect. Reflection belongs solely to human beings. Likewise, Amazon has never sold a book to an animal.With regard to language, Abram fails to consider the phenomenon of listening. Listening as a canonical aspect of human language receives almost no attention. Yet, it is always present. Gestures, utterances, signs, symbols, tokens are given all of the weight.We need more work here."
3,"Wonderful book, clean, pretty bird on the cover, tough read.",". . .even for a poet. You have to be willing to wade through the rice paddy to catch the fireflies. I only pray god in a heaven I can feel the texture of its pages, leaving newly noticed fingerprints, watch with these tired eyeballs the linesrun along like water in the webbed mouth of a cave,that I can finish. . . Oh. Oh, god, right now. Gotta read, what if I miss it?"
5,"A magical, soulful book",I read this book because I met the author at a magicians' conference and was fascinated by his study of shamanism. When I read it I connected with it totally. I felt that FINALLY someone is talking about the world as something that isn't just about people. I'm very tired of being so human-focused all the time. This book was very refreshing and wonderful.
4,Finding Lost Connections with the World,"This amazing study has put me back in touch with a truth I have always known in part, but now understand at a new depth. David Abram's understanding of language as the medium of all connexion with the world we are part of is profound and opens a realm of experience that few in the so-called developed cultures are now even dimly aware of. An enlightened and timely addition to the renewed human search for meaning."
2,Another anti-purchase opinion,"I had a 2MB Canon digital camera. I bought the Sony for it's size, and for 5MB quality. However, as others have said, the vast majority of my pictures are blurry. With my Canon, I used to be driving and simply hold my camera out and snap away off to the side to get pretty good pics. With this camera, if you're not absolutely still, I mean not the slightest quiver, the pic is blurry. I've played with every possible setting, but the results are just crappy. I was about to see if I could get tech support, since I figured the camera was broken, but I see that it's just the way the camera is. Too bad. I'll have to return it."
5,accessories to the fact,"attention small camera seekers: this is the ONE. Just buy a hard sided ipod case to keep it in - perfect size, clips on anything, just slide out camera and go. I travel to Europe alot, and this was really a great tool - surprised by quality and ease of use. No waiting to take pixs, and didn't run out of power ever. Not much to take along, either -not trying to sell the camera, but if you're a traveler, be confident that this will do the job beautifully and unobtrusively."
1,look for something else,"I used it for about a year, before it died. I can buy a new one for the price Sony is chargeing to repair it. But I won't because my pictures were always blurry also. I was a Sony fan, but not any more."
1,Camera was damaged,"Constantly has a blue line running from top to bottom of screen. I owned this camera before and loved it. This particular one that I bought, was defected."
3,"Good, could have been great","My first problem is the lack of a tripod mount. There is NO excuse for a $500.00 camera to lack this most basic part- even if it were a part of the USB cradle. While I am on the subject of USB- You cannot connect to your computer unless you sit it inside the cradle, or buy another special cable to plug directly into the camera. My final peeve with this camera is that it eats it's battery even when turned off. Charge the battery, put it in your bag, and 3 days later, the battery is at 50% capacity.On the + side, the display is wonderful, and picture quality is excellent as well. But unless you absolutely have to have the tiny size, you can do a LOT better."
3,Too many blurry pictures,"I'm a die-hard Sony fan and have owned many Sony cameras, but I do not recommend this one: Far too many blurry pictures."
2,compromise camera,"5.1 MP from the T1 is disastrous compared to my Sony 717 which is also 5.1 MP. The lack of clarity is also worse than my old Canon IXUS 2.0 MP. I thought that Sony had finally combined their brilliant electronics with imaging in an ultracompact size, but the image quality is a big disappointment. I have now reverted to lugging around my big 717 again. To all potential buyers - compare with the Canons and you will see what I mean."
2,This is not a general-purpose camera,"This camera was a disappointment to me. Photos taken outdoors do turn out well, but indoors is another story. The flash is very weak, and redeye is a huge problem.If you plan on taking photos at birthday parties or other social events, don't buy this camera. If all you want to do is take outdoor shots, then the Sony DSC-T1 might be a good choice. But how many people never want to use their digital camera to photograph social functions?My advice is to shop around for another camera. This one is a dud."
2,Nice Camera BUT ok pictures & unfriendly to travelers,"Camera looks great and functions admirably, but if you travel a lot like I do, be warned. You will need to bring 2 huge cords just to charge the battery, a USB cord and a bulky dock station. Sony's solution is charging you 50 for the travel charger and 20 for the travel USB cord. Add this to the case you need to buy to protect the huge (although sweet) 2.5"" screen and a larger capacity memory stick (included 32 MB holds a whopping 12 photos) you are looking at an extra 150-200 dollars on top of the retail price - OUCH! Definitely not worth it + Canon still has a sweeter picture for the $$$. It wouldn't bother me so much if it was a larger camera, but if Sony is pushing this is as a SLEEK camera, the whole package should be as well."
1,design & color problems,"1. The sliding lid has no lock and comes down very easily if it's sitting in your pocket - very annoying & wastes battery life.2. the flash is at the same height & right next to the lens which leads to a very high rate of red-eye & i mean A LOT of red-eye.3. The color balances were off - the colors came in very reddish-orangish which I would have to manually alter in Photoshop.Save yourself some money and wait till the next version comes out. It's a slick camera size-wise for sure, but it's just not good enough..."
2,Indoor pictures are terrible,"I have tried adjusting the flash on this camera every which way, but my indoor pictures are still terrible. Everything is sooo dark. Red eye is terrible. For the price I thought I was getting a top of the line point and shoot camera. I love the size and the LCD, but I am not impressed by the photo quality."
4,Great Camera... Memory Stick disfunction... :(,"We love this camera. It's small size, ease of use... the only problem is the Memory Stick Duo. We bought a 256 mb stick and every so often (and more than we'd like for sure) the memory stick kicks back an error message and we can't take pictures anymore. We have to power down then power up again to take another picture. This has been happening more and more and we've only had the camera less than 2 months. We've tried reformatting the stick several times to no avail. Not sure what to do next. But the problem with the memory aside, it's a fantastic camera. Just hope there's a way around this problem."
1,SONY SUCKS,"I've lost my faith in the once-giant Japanese company Sony...they've gradually gone downhill over the years and my personal faith in them has eroded from this DSC T1 camera to the other things like walkmans, boom boxes, TV's and every other Sony product I've ever purchased...they're cheap products that offer no customer support and they've lost touch with a simple word: RELIABILITY.This camera broke after a few months of using it...and I bought it with the hope that it wouldn't break because of the non-moving lens...I liked the design of the camera - how the cover protected the lens...but the LCD started going haywire on me and the resulting pictures reflected this...I'm so disgusted with Sony products...I've switched to Samsung and Nikon and other companies that are making strides."
1,Remember when Sony products were good and reliable?,"I purchased this camera new a few years ago. I paid over $500 when it came out, plus an extended warranty. Despite the lack of red-eye reduction and horrible shutter speed, it's size has allowed me to bring it with me almost anywhere. Tonight though, I pick my camera off the charger, turn it on to take a picture and the lens is no longer working correctly. I have never abused this camera and have kept it in excellent condition, yet it just failed for no reason. I used to buy all sony products in the 90's. You paid a little more but you got quality. This doesn't seem to be the case anymore. I have Discman's that have worked for 10+ years, yet I cannot get 2 out of a digital camera. I checked ebay and this seems to be a common problem. I am never buying a sony product again."
2,Not impressed with this camera,"I bought this camera as an upgrade to our first Olympus digital camera and was very unimpressed. The 2 major issues I found was that the indoor pictures were dark and the red eye was awful, even with the red eye reduction on. The camera looks good but I didn't find much more to be impressed with. I am going back to Olympus."
1,In the market for a new camera,"Like many other reviewers, I had terrible problems with blurry indoor photos and redeye. Some favorable reviews suggest there are ways to correct this, but I will never know because I picked up the camera one day and the LCD was broken. I can't think of anything I did that caused the break, but it rendered the camera completely unusable since it does not have a viewfinder. Like another reviewer who had the same problem, I found the cost of the repair was more than the cost to replace. Even if the picture quality problems could be resolved, I would never buy another camera without a viewfinder, regardless of how ""sexy"" the design..."
2,Indoor Pictures are Horrible!!!!,"I have had this camera for a few months now. I also own an olympus c3020 and C8080. I also own a samsung 4010 (I wouldn't waste your money on this one). The pictures on my olympus come out sooooo nice and the night pictures have minimal to no red eye. This camera takes horrible pictures indoors and at night. Stick with Olympus and Canon. I gave it two stars instead of one because the outdoor pictures actually came out nice. I'm looking to get rid of this camera, maybe sell it. Don't buy it. Sony can not make cameras."
1,Very disappointed,This is rated a 1 only because negative 1 wasn't available...I got this camera two years ago and the last 6 months have been horrible! If you're taking a picture of someone breathing you're picture will be blurry! This camera is not for parents for sure! There have been so many pictures moments lost because this camera just doesn't work like it did when I first got it...There have been several times that I would buy a disposable camera because I knew this camera was just going to crap out on me.The only good thing I can say about this camera is the appearance is nice - slim enough to slide right in your pocket.What's the use of that quality when the picture quality sucks?
5,Don't expect miracles,"Although this is a 5MP camera, it has a small lens and low power flash. This is the camera you put in your pocket rather than over your shoulder. If you can accept the trade-offs and want the ultimate in portability this unit is great. I wasn't interested in the video when I got it. I'm so impressed I want a bigger MS so I can do more. Picture quality is fair-good depending on lighting. It's not for art, it's for photos."
5,I love love this Camera..,"People are nuts!I have no idea what they are talking about, this is the best camera ever..It's so easy to use and is so durable and takes great pictures..It's light and compact and I love this camera..I find no problems with it..It's so great that even all my friends are buying it..I am a mother of 2 fiesty toddlers and I can get great pictures..The best part there is no couple second delay when shooting the picture and that's why I always get that smile..If you are a parent or just looking for a small camera this the best you can get..I would recommed this camera to everyone..."
4,Pretty good,"This camera takes very nice pictures. However pictures with flash are difficult. Your subject has to be close, much closer than other cameras I have seen. It has a feature to increase the flashwhich helps slightly but they usually come out dark.I have read the manual thoroughly and it is pretty good but I still do have questions. One writer says that there is a tripod mount available. I will look for it because it would come in handy for dark shots. I have taken night pictures in Hong Kong which would be very nice if I could have held the camera steady enough."
1,Terrible pictures,"I have owned this camera for almost a year now, and I was hoping to find some postings on how to fix all the issues I've had with it. At first I was so enchanted by the size and looks of this thing that I thought I'd overlook the terrible pictures until I figured out how to operate it better. My pictures turned out dark, blurry, and grainy, and my subjects had red eye. I tried and tried to fix it.....read the manual over and over, and finally took it in to a specialty digital camera/camcorder store. Well, it turns out that it just does not operate better. Apparently many people have this problem, and there's just nothing you can do about it. So now I have this camera that I paid almost $600 for months and months ago when it first came out, I can't return it, and I certainly can't use it. Don't buy this camera. It's pretty to look at, but that's about all you'll be doing."
4,Sony Cybershot DSC-T1,The coolest camera you can own for the money! If you actually learn how to use the camera by reading the manual you will have killer photos. All the complaints about blury pictures are the result of people not taking the time to learn how to use this equipment...period.
4,Sony...,"I bought the Sony DSC-T1 two weeks ago. I was very impressed by the size, the screen, and the features. It is an awesome camera that I have only found two small shortfalls with:1. The flash is only rated to a distance of 1.5 to 2 meters, this sucks in a no light or very low light environment.2. The Red Eye reducer is not so great.If you're looking for a case to protect this tiny camera, I would suggest strolling over to the PDA section of the store and picking up the PEGA-CA23 Carrying Case for Sony CLIE TJ/TH/SJ Series Handhelds. The only thing that would make it better is Velcro... but the snap works fine and does not endanger the camera's screen. P>Over all I am very happy with the features and quality the T1 offers, the video and sounds are great, you can add 5sec audio tags to any image and it's so damn sexy."
1,"Great Camera, Horrible Pictures","About one in five pictures comes out perfectly. The others suck. I had a Nikon Coolpix before and really thought I was trading up with this one, but it is really bad.Do not buy this camera!!!!!!!!!!!111"
2,Disappointed and will NOT recommend...,"I bought this camera thinking that I will have a sleek/sexy camera with almost all new features. But I was diappointed that leader in electronics ""SONY"" would give such a awful product. As many other reviewers I had problems with 'red eye' even if the red eye reduction is ON. I read the manual again and again, but NO USE and could not fix the problem of red eye if taking ANY INDOOR pictures. Even one of my friends argued that red eye is NOT the problem of a camera, but I could not believe that DSC-T1 takes almost all indoor/night/zoom pictures with red eye. I am giving 2 stars for the video recording with clear voice (but I need a digital camera). I will never recommend DSC-T1 to any of my friends/relatives. Totally un-happy with the product."
2,"nice design, poor quality.... you should pass","poor quality images...whenever you use a flash, everyone in frame has red eye, overall the pictures are somewhat grainy and the color is dull, very dull. You'd be better off getting a Samsung or a Cannon."
1,it is horrible,"I bought this camera nearly year ago, worst camera I ever bought, it blurs out images if some one is moving especially if the mode is auto. You expect it works better if you taking pictures casually in auto mode, but it is not. It is dissapointing that sony made real bad one like this. Do not bugy camera if you planning to take picture during night time, the pictures end up with white shadow patches(big circular spots). The flash is useless for > 4-5 feet."
1,I will never purchase another Sony Camera!,"Did not use this camera much. I got the camera out to use it and it does not work! Sony is not willing to help me with the recall! They tell me the recall ended in 2010. I paid a lot of money for this camera and for the use I got out of it, I was taken."
5,many years of test.,"i used this item for over 7 years. 2 tours to Iraq..finally, it died on me.. but it took so many priceless pictures..slide cover allowed me to be ""ready to shoot"" in second."
3,Not bad at all but...,"I prefer to use film cameras. I decided to try this sony digital because of the lens (Carl Zeiss). Zeiss makes great sharp glass (camera lenses) good example Contax G2.I was disappointed with this camera. I haven't been able to get sharp images from this camera.Videos are dark when taken in ambient lighting situations. You shouldn't have to light your home like a photo studio to get video. I have back, front and fill light. Now my videos look great.Pictures look okay but I'd rather have film and a manual camera. There are no real manual control settings. If you want a fast shutter you have to settle for certain crappy aperture settings. The battery life is a joke. I am lucky if it holds a charge for more than 2 hours.If all you want is a point and shoot this is it. I wouldn't trust this camera for my important photos. Which I have in the past and have been truly disappointed.Its not really worth the money. You can do better."
2,LCD Screen BIG and BROKEN!,"I was really please with this camera until I removed it from my coat pocket and fount the LCD Screen Broken. A quick call to sony warranty department leaves me wondering how much the repair is going to cost me. I was told at the least...$171.00 if it was determined to be due to physical damage. OK, I know it did'nt just crack on it's own, but how much contact should the thing be able to resist? I'll let you know how Sony handles the issue."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUT MONEY,"I bought this camera on a trip to NY. The photos are of poor quality and many of them look blurry. I have a Canon Power Shot S400 which is by far a better camera which produces clear and clean pictures. No one who used the Sony Cibershot camera could take an acceptable photo; even the employees at the store where I bought the camera! Since there were doubts that it was damaged, after three days they replaced me the camera with another one. The pictures where as bad as the first one. When I returned from my trip, after sending various photos to my friends one called me and gave me the best advice: RETRUN THAT CAMERA; and that was what I did."
2,No good picture when not bright environment,"The design is quite good as almost of you agree. But, the picture quality, especially inside of a building, is quite disappointing. Maybe, that seems due to the too small lense. And, unless you are very careful to firmly fix your hands, the pictures inside become very blurry. I had a 2MP pixel sony Cybershot (with very long lense body) which I bought a few years ago. I had thought that I could abandon it after I bought this new DSC. But, I still need the old one. There are other complaints too. The memory chip is quite expensive - you know only Sony uses it. I had to pay over 110 dollars for 256MB, which otherwise about $40."
2,Awesome size...ok pictures,"The compact size is incredible but do not count on getting high quality pictures just because it is 5.0 mp. I learned this the hard way. The lense size is very important as well as the flash settings. This camera does not take high quality, crisp pictures. I suggest sticking to bigger cameras that produce better pictures."
2,Bad investment,"I am ready to get rid of my camera.Like everone else says too many blurry pictures, thats a lot of money to pay and get all these bad pictures. Sony let us down this time."
2,Poor picture quality ruins an otherwise good camera,"This camera could've been great. Battery life is good, size is awesome, no speed problems and movies are very good. But in the end, these features don't make up for the poor indoor picture quality. This camera is perfectly sized for taking to parties and get togethers but the pictures it produces at those events are not worth the $450 price tag. In anything but outdoor sunlight, expect to see lots of noise in pictures and very bad red eye (even with the red eye setting turned on). I'm going back to my 4 year old digital camera because this one is so bad."
2,not worth it,"I am not a serious photographer. However, it doesn't take one to know that this camera just takes bad pictures. Fuzzy, blurry, noisy, and dull. How do I know? I held it side by side with a friend's Canon A400 (which costs about 1/3 the price of this Sony) and took the exact same pictures with both cameras on auto adjust, since that is the setting I would be using almost all of the time. The difference was both ridiculous and sad. I nearly set fire to the carpet running out to return this thing. Other reviews have said that one must read the manual to become familiar enough with the camera to achieve good results. This is of course a logical and valid point. Still, this is supposed to be a ""point-and-shoot"" camera. If one must study for hours to simply take a decent picture without using any special functions, the camera ceases to be ""point-and-shoot"". I ended up going with a Canon SD200 instead and I am more than impressed."
4,BRAAAAAIIIiiiinsss,"Everything you wanted to know and didnt want to know about zombies is in this book. If you are a zombie fan, this book belongs on your shelf. It is worth the price alone for the ""Zombie Filmography"" which lists and gives a brief description on every zombie film ever made"
4,a great book documenting the history of zombies in cinema,"This book was required reading for my horror literature class. The author gives reviews and spoilers for just about every zombie movie made before 2005, so its a bit dated. Great insight is given on how the zombie monster has evolved over the last 50 years and where it seems to be headed. I often reference this book when talking zombies with my friends."
4,"Comprehensive, detailed and fun","This is a well informed and enjoyable book, with lots of great pictures and a good span of knowledge. It does in places just seem to list things together for the sake of it, but overall I recommend it as it has a lot of enthusiasm and provides plenty of enjoyable for the enthusiast.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
5,What We Have All Been Waiting For.,"I think the best comparison to describe how awe-inspiring this book is, is to say it like this: This book is to zombie fans what the Bible is to Christians and its printing is practically the second-freaking-coming. It is exhaustingly thourough, both in its history and its filmography. This book could be justifiably purchased for so much more than a measley 20 dollars. If you are a zombie fan, buy this book over food."
5,double penetration,This double version is very hard to find and usually expensive but is totally worth it. What's not to love about one of the greatest live albums with even more killer material?Check out Mighty High...In Drug City while you're at it.
1,Adam's Review is Approriate,"Customers have a right to know about an artist's political, religious or social views. Though I love gospel and other Christian music, I would not want to spend even a dime supporting this woman. True Christians who might be looking for inspirational music should know the truth about Paulie. She is not a real Christian or she would not spread a message of ignorance and hate alongside her spiritually misquided and mentally disturbed spouse. They are an embarassment to people of faith who truly love Jesus and understand his message."
5,A Mainah's thoughts.,"My purchase of this fine work was due to a passion of one song I had the pleasure of hearing her play ""unplugged"". The ""Red Road"", I was thrilled when I heard some 18 or so months ago that she was going ahead with this ""calling""/project, mostly knowing that I'd finally have a good studio recording of this song. However when she expounded on the format that her and her producer were ""going"" after I was a bit apprehensive. But I wrote the check and anxiously waited that period of time. Well I'm here to say that this ""Plugged In"" labor is well worth the waiting for Gods Timing, and His/our encouragement for Paulie. Very Well done Paulie and you too Roy! 8^) Buy it... The title cut has a tremendous testimony attached... Perhaps she'll share it with you..."
3,Not for the serious prophecy scholar,"This book is funny, witty, and shows a knowledge of popular culture. It is not for the serious prophecy scholar. However, it does not puport to be so and is quite entertaining. It is worth reading for entertainment and is, at times, appropriately funny."
1,not any good...,"i found little if any humor in this. i tried to read this for an hour then stopped. boring, cocky and dry"
1,A REALLY stupid book...it practically made fun of the Bible.,"PLEASE don't waste your hard earned money on this book. I was VERY disappointed because it seemed as if the author was poking fun at and mocking the Bible. After skimming through this book, I thought that the author had to be an unbeliever but then noticed that he attends a Baptist church...I was shocked! I found absolutely NO humor in what I read and I am considered to be a funny person by family and friends! I am going to take this book back for a refund. I honestly cannot believe that I purchased it in a Christian bookstore."
3,Bad Vendor - Poor Customer Service - BEWARE,"The bowls are fine but MAKE SURE YOU REALLY WANT THEM BEFORE YOU ORDER THEM. The vendor, which is not Amazon, does not provide any reasonable return shipping and when we decided we didn't really like them we found out it would cost as much to send them back as it did to buy them in the first place. I will never do business with this vendor again."
1,Do not buy,"Nova Set of 3 Mixing Bowls - BrownThese bowls are shipped nested, with only flimsy corrugated paper between the bowls. My shipment arrived with the two outer bowls broken."
2,"5 STARS for the Product, -3 STARS for the Packaging",I love the SANGO NOVA BROWN dishware and rate it 5 stars. This boxed set of bowls is just not padded enough for the weight. The slightest rough handling by a shipper is going to result in damage as can be seen in the prior reviewer's comments. Mine too arrived broken. Sure seems like Sango would put a bit more padding between those bowls in the box. Amazon could also do a better job of protecting this item when they pack it for shipping. I sure hope Amazon gets credit from Sango for all these broken pieces. Combined score +2.
2,Won't last through shipping....,"These bowls are very cute and match my dish set but they were shipped 3 times and every time at least one bowl was broken. I went through Amazon twice then BB&B the last time, one bowl was still broken so I took it back to the local store, received my money back then bought the 2 unbroken bowls for less than all three. At least I hav 2!"
1,Broken Twice,"They sent the first box they were all broke, they shipped them out a second time and broke again, the box they shipped them in was too big and not enough packing, so they wont ship out any more and I'm waiting for a creditDawn"
5,Beautiful!,"Fast shipping and I swear they used a whole roll of bubble wrap....they are beautiful, match my kitchen and I LOVE them!"
4,A Missing Manual for Life,"This is one of the missing manuals for life. Great practical tips for anyone, even if you are already intuitive."
5,Insightful,"This book has been incredibly eye-opening, insightful, and exciting. I fee like I've started a whole new journey after reading this book. Aready I've started to approach my life differently. Thankful to have found this book."
2,Not the book for me.,"Good book. But I found it to ""chatty"". Get to the facts, and move on.It's a beginners guide that gives a lot of stories about others and experiences they've had. It almost seems like the author is trying to convince you by sharing experiences."
3,Trust your vibes' Secret tools for Six -Sensory Living,"I am not neccesarily intuitive. I believe though that people who are looking for a way to determine their level of intuition through ways that are group oriented than this book will help guide you through the way. In terms of individual use, I think that some of the book is good."
1,Really?,A collection of common places and little stories which may be useful probably for very young people. At my age (middle-age and over) I have already figured those things out.
5,So Much Became Clear,"As someone interested in filmmaking I started reading Dreams on Film to learn how dreams are used as a technique in movies. But the book's payoff surprised me. I got an easy to understand overview of how science views the psychology of dreams, from Freud and Jung to modern researchers. Really fascinating. The more I read the more I began to understand my own dream life (sleeping I mean). If you are intrigued by the mystery of dreams don't waste your time on scientific publications, this book lays it all out and entertains along the way. It'll open your mind to your own dreams and illuminate the dream scenes in some of your favorite films. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in what it means to dream.Gary Broughman, author of the novel Which One of You?Which One of You?"
3,Key to Rebecca,I thought the TV version did not do justice to the book nor to the development of the characters. The producers should have stuck to the book. Cliff Roberton was very good and so was Season Hubley although her character in the book is much more interesting and complex.
4,Great fantasy and very entertaining,everyone that reads this book will instantly become attached and will never be able to put this book down!
5,Awesome! Maybe even better than the 3rd in some ways,"This is a fun, fun game. It's pretty simple and there certainly are better graphics out there, however sometimes the simplest computer games are the best ones.You are in control of whoever you throw into your Conestoga wagon along with the supplies you buy! You can go hunting for food or you can trade. There are plenty of random events, namely sicknesses and injuries. Sometimes you find an abandoned wagon and you can get free stuff, there are prairie fires, duststorms, hailstorms, etc!The reason I say that it's better than the 3rd in some ways is there are more stops along the way. I really should get around to trying the fourth and fifth!! This is a really exciting game."
5,So beautiful...,Finally! The best of the best! Gianluca is one of the greatest artists I've ever heard! This album is a great oportunity for those who don't know him yet. I would recommend it to anyone who like good music.
3,Cinematic Alzheimer's...,"THE FORGOTTEN is a creepy, paranoia inducing tale of memory loss, deception, government conspiracy, abduction, and possible insanity. Telly (Julianne Moore from Hannibal and Safe) is a mum who is 14 months into grieving for her dead son. Or is she? Pictures and videos of the boy begin disappearing, while those around her seem to have no memory of her son's having ever existed! This leads Telly on a quest for the truth, no matter how terrible or bizarre it may be. Ms. Moore is always a pleasure to watch, as her talents lift even the most preposterous material into the realm of believability. She is the heart and soul of THE FORGOTTEN. Without her earnest performance, this could have been yet another disaster like THE HAPPENING (well, maybe not THAT godawful)..."
2,Forgettable,"""The Forgotten"" looks like a bad episode of the X-Files or the Twilight Zone. A mother grieves the death of her young son, only to be told (by her therapist, her husband and the whole world) that the boy never existed. She forms an unlikely alliance with an alcoholic ex baseball player and the whole thing turns really, really ludicrous. Julianne Moore delivers, as usual, a wonderful performance, but not even her talent can rescue this silly movie."
1,Trash unless you are 10,"This is for anyone who has never seen a single science-fiction episode of any program on television which tells you just how many times this kind of thing has been rehashed before and will be again. The film itself is terribly, painfully, slow with an ending that is even more stupid than the ones they had in arthouse 60s science-fiction porn0 flicks.Trash unless you are 10."
2,"Exciting, but ultimately dumb","The Forgotten manages to pull you in with a number of interesting hooks, but pushes you away with an equal or greater number of ""conspiracy theory"" cliches. I'm sorry to ruin the ""surprise"" here, but I must say it: there are aliens. And abduction. And ""experimentation"". The single episode of ""The X-Files"" that I saw, which featured an old man in a wheelchair who wandered around a school using mystic powers, was more innovative than this.The reason this movie gets 2 stars is because of the first half, which is genuinely exciting. After the heroine looks to the sky and briefly sees a UFO hovering in the clouds, though, it slowly deteriorates, finally ending with a dull, barely-worth-watching climax, which claims a bulletproof man briefly reverting to his extraterrestrial form as its only interesting moment."
3,"Well, At Least The Ending Isn't A Dream!","Telly (Julianne Moore) and Ash (Dominic West) play two separate parents (previously unknown to eachother) who find that they both lost their young children in a plane crash on the way to a summer camp. The problem is they keep ""losing"" their memories or worst, clear possessions of their child they know they once had. It feels like their memory of their lost child is being `erased' from them or that they might be going crazy. That's lots of fun to watch. Of course, the spouses are trying their best to deal with this annoying craziness, but there is only so much a person can do! Director Joseph Ruben inserts lots of mind-bending special effects and after an hour you wonder what in the heck is going on here? Suffice it to say that if you ever saw a movie where it turns out everything was really a dream, you know how ripped off you felt. Well, the ending here is no less interesting and as much of a letdown. Think of a bad television version of the ""X-Files""!"
2,It was just ok,I like this movie until they brought in the possibility of someone from somewhere else abducting children. It made the movie seem unrealistic and stupid. I wish i had not seen this movie because it was a complete waste of time.
2,tired plot yields disappointing film,"I chose this movie under the assumption that it would be a psycological thriller with perhaps a touch of the supernatural much like the 6th Sense. Instead, it turned out to be a cliched government conspiracy, alien UFO movie. At times I thought I was watching a poorly made episode of the X-Files. Is it a coincidence that Julianne Moore plays the red-headed lead named ""Telly"", while the X-Files female lead was another red-head by the name of ""Sculley""? Maybe I'm paranoid, but this movie stinks. The writers could not even come up with a plausible reason for the aliens' experiments. The DVD contains 2 endings, both of which were garbage, but the theatrical ending was actually the worst. Julianne does a compentant job playing a grieving mother, but the rest of the cast is forgetable. Julianne seems to be a fine actress, but when has she ever picked a good script? At least the title is appropriate since this movie should be among the forgotten."
1,Lousy crud,"The Forgotten was lame and unsatisfying. They started with a decent premise and managed to milk it for a few good thrills, but ultimately the story went nowhere and didn't really make any sense.I have no objection to science fiction movies that set their own rules about what can happen and what can't. But the rules need to have some kind of logical or conceptual basis, like there was a thought process that went into making them. Otherwise, as is the case with this movie, the whole thing just comes off as being a cheap, unconvincing, ripoff.For a GREAT science fiction movie that deals with similar themes, try Dark City."
3,Confusing But Gripping,"Even after seeing this film I'm still not sure what to think. I mean, it did hold my attention throughout the entire film but I'm still not sure what really happened.Telly is struggling to cope with the loss of her 9-year-old son. She is stunned when her psychiatrist and her husband tell her that she has created eight years of memories of a son she never had. But when she meets the father of one of her son's friend who is having the same experience, Telly embarks on a mission to prove her son's existence and her sanity.That's the plot but I don't understand it."
3,"RENT IT, THEN FORGET IT","This movie is worth one viewing I guess. Good enough to filla lazy afternoon or uneventful evening, hardly worth a secondshowing though. The plot does not hold together very well, thecharacters are rather shallow. We don't get to know much aboutthem aside from the main theme, which made it kind of hard forme to empathize with them or their quest. On the other hand, itdoes have some intense action sprinkled here and there thoughout, and and some interesting plot twists that you may or may notsee coming. I was waiting for something big and unexpected at theend. Came away disappointed on that. I hope I was able to helpin some way, I'll leave it to some of the other reviewers togive away the whole movie (I hate that)!Thanks,Tom"
2,"Great idea, just needed more development","This movie opens up very well and I am pleased with the development of both the characters and the story. You are left wondering what is happening at the beginning and your mind is racing with possibilities.However, about an hour or so into the movie, things are just thrown at you. It is almost like the writers had where they wanted to go in mind and just forgot to fill-in the details. I was ready to be pushed and pulled, and finally be given a resolution. Instead, it was a huge build-up with a quick ending.Needless to say, I was overall dissappointed. I would have given only 1 star except for some decent effects, including a cool car accident scene that made me jump."
2,I forgot about this movie after I saw it,"To make it short, this movie is pretty bad. It looked like it had potential at some parts but it doesn't. This is worth renting (maybe)but definately not worth buying. Yet another failed attempt at a horror/sci-fi flick."
2,Stunk.,"I really can't think of anything positive to say about this movie. It was not even down to the so bad it is funny level. It was just mediocre, boring, and stupid. A waste of time, pure and simple."
4,Nice!,"Pretty cool movie. It was a different plot than most of the movies lately (which all seem to be remakes of old movies, or re-hashed plots). Kind of a sleeper in the thearters, but did well as a DVD rental. I'd definitely recommend giving it a watch."
1,The Forgotten is forgettable,"I can't say much about this film as it is just a real dud. The plot is totally unbelievable although it has a clever premise. The acting is strictly by the numbers, the direction pedestrian at best, and the effect were just average. Maybe I'll rewrite this review when I'm in a better mood, but for now, this is film is one to forget renting or buying."
1,"Good acting, poor story","This movie had a halfway decent set up and good acting, but the storyline deteriorated as the secrets were revealed and the ending made no sense. That's 91 minutes of my life that I will never get back, honestly my time would have been better spent sitting in an empty room staring off into space, at least then I could pass it off as meditating."
1,Forget it about it,"This sounded like a movie from ""The Twilight Zone"", when i read it at the rental store. The movie was ok and freaky up till the point where the Agents started coming in to the picture, that's when I knew this would turn out to be a preditcable and lame movie; I was right. Really lame, turn out to be about alien abduction. Totally uniteresting. This really be would've been an awesome and Twilight Zone like movie if it turned out to be a psychological thriller, and that the kid really never did exist or left us guessing whether he did or not."
1,there is no place for 0 stars....,I don't know what to say....it's a stupid movie....just skip it please.
2,a short and simple review,"I was hoping for a good psychological socio thriller and I saw a poorly written Hollywood piece of crap. So what is Hollywood Craps definition? Hollywood Crap consist of a very poor script and CGI effects to mask the poor script.This movie is just as dissappointing as The Village. Poorly written lines, no chemistry between the 2 main characters and a bad ending. Definetly not a movie you could watch twice.If I had a choice between watching this movie again or going on fear factor and drinking goat urine, I might pick this movie... I thinkending=1 starsDirecting and Editing=3 starsplot & storyline=2.5 starsreplay value=1 starsOVERALL= 1.87 TOTAL STARS(...)"
2,"Should be ""Forgotten""","I am trying to think of something positive to say about this movie and I can't. The makers couldn't decide what they wanted to do and the movie is a total mishmash that leaves you shaking your head in the end.A woman remembers seeing her son off on a plane and him dying in a crash with a friend's daughter that she knew from the playground. Nobody else seems to remember him and all traces of his existance seem to have been wiped out.When she comes upon her ""friend"" he has also forgotten that both their children ever existed. The woman forces him to remember his daughter and then he decides to help her. The movie implodes from that point on and not even Alfre Woodard can save it. It seems like the director thought he was making another Matrix type movie whereas he was making a mishmash that couldn't decide whether everything was caused by aliens, gods, magic, or what. Don't bother with this one."
2,easily 'forgotten',"I like the kind of suspense/horror movies where there is still some shred of plausibility to the plot and also how it unfolds. You never get that with this movie. I mean, what kind of alien?/bad guys?/gov't agents? ...(we're never really told who 'they' are)...needs to conduct an experiment to test the bonds of a mothers love for her child? Aren't there bigger things in the galaxy to contemplate for the aliens/bad guys/gov't agents lol? And the parts where people got whisked away unexpectedly into the sky made me laugh out loud! Seeing Julian Moore is about the only redeeming thing about this movie, because she's such a great actor, even in this stinker of movie."
1,Forget about it.,"Set your watch and leave the theater about half way through this film. The beginning sets up a character that is confused, angry, hurt and sad. Moore does a splendid job of acting and then the script gets in the way and it turns into a cheesy ""X-Files"" episode. The film wanders around with characters accepting plot twists that would have anyone else institutionalized. Save your money or search on Google for Julianne Moore films and rent one."
1,FORGET TO SEE THIS MOVIE,"Everything you see in the advertising is in the first fifteen minutes and then ... its an episode of the X-Files. The ""trick"" in this film is so absurd that it really ruins any possible enjoyment you could have. I cannot believe anyone spent millions of dollars to make a film like this. Children are starving all over the world and this garbage exists! I can't begin to explain how much I despise this film!"
1,laughably bad,this movie is a waste of celluloid and an insult to thousands of better ideas that never got made. A mess - skip it.
4,Sci-Fi Coolness,This is the most un-science fiction science fiction film I know of. I love it and the cast. A little syrupy for some perhaps but not much. The basic idea is a woman convinced that her son did not die in an accident struggles to reclaim the memories of him alive. Her efforts are suddenly rewarded with everyone forgetting the child ever existed at all! And more changes keep happening. She must solve the riddle or hazard losing her sanity!
5,A different premise,"I finally saw this movie and can say it was worth the rental. To be better understood you need to be aware that I viewed this from an aspect other then entertainment. I take in a lot of movies for things like symbolism and modern day myths. This film was ""mentioned"" to myself as a must see and I previously never had heard of it. Many of the titles I'll sit through aren't very good usually. This film did not disappoint at all I am actually surprised by it's watch-ability. Acting and story were good and while I got what I required I was pleasantly entertained also. Solid B rating."
3,Nice outcome,I like this movie. I rated it a 3 just because I wish there would have been more detail about the husband wife relationship. Some scenes were just unreal in the sense that the obvious move or choice wasn't made.
3,Very good and then flat,"For most of this movie, I was ready to rate it a 4 or even 5. Although the lead actress was melodramatic at points, she became better as it progressed. The lead actor was wonderful. The problem, however, was with the resolution of the story. It seemed as if the writers didn't know exactly how to end the film. The ending they picked simply didn't match the greatness of the rest of the film. I definitely recommend it, but the ending might leave you feeling a little disappointed."
3,The Forgotten,"The plot of The Forgotten feels like a poorly executed attempt at an episode of the X Files. As the answer to the puzzle of the missing children is slowly revealed to the viewer, it becomes progressively less believable and ultimately ridiculous. All the tension built up through the first part of the movie is just lost in a predictable and unsatisfactory ending.Having said that, the movie isn't all bad. There were at least 2, maybe 3, scenes that caused the entire theater to leap right out of their seats. It was great to see Alfrie Woodard for the first time in a long time, albeit in a role unworthy of an actress of her talent. The first half of the movie is intriguing, and had the(ultimately unrealized) promise of a fairly good thriller. It was enjoyable as a free sneak-peak, but I'm glad I didn't pay $8 for it."
1,In one word - lame,"With the most ridiculous, kitschy effects I've seen yet in a movie, the Forgotten is easily one DVD, which if you are considering picking up, should be forgotten. The acting was ok, but the script was absurd. I was kicking myself for having bought this one."
3,"ok flick....kinda regret buying it, though","Not trying to be a hater, but I honestly regret buying this film. I saw it in theaters and thought, ""Pretty clever. Ms. Moore certainly is a phenominal actress,"" and she is; she does a great performance in this film as the freaked-out mother on a mission to find her child who mysteriously vanished from the face of the Earth, from photographs, from people's memories.NO SPOILERS, but I didn't care for the ending.This is a movie that, if you're wanting to have a scary-movie-theme movie night with your friends, you might check this out. The problem is there are about a dozen other films with this exact plot. It's something to rent, and I give it 3 stars because it is a good film. It's just not worth the money to own, because the odds are you'll only watch it once."
3,Strange setup but I like it ;D,"I was told this movie was not worth to watch but after watching it, I had to say I'm kind of like it. Strange plot but I like it."
3,Easily FORGOTTEN!,"The first half of this film takes you into a psychological mystery that succeeds in keeping you wondering.However, by the time the mystery is finally revealed, you're ultimately let down by what feels like a cliche of the ""aliens stole my brain!"" revelation (hey, it practically happened to Arnold in TOTAL RECALL). Unfortunately, even Julianne Moore's good acting can't save this one.Perhaps if this ridiculous story had been used for an X-FILES movie of the week, it would have made more sense."
2,"Boring stuff here folks, but . . .","While I found Forgotten to be pretty boring, it does have a couple of good moments worth seeing. Rent this one and fast forward to about 1:10 into the picture and watch the action. It's worth seeing. I was totally surprised!"
1,"Good movie, bad movie studio","The movie was pretty good...after I could get it to play. I have an ILo DVD recorder and this DVD would not play. The menus would load, but when I started to play the movie it would just freeze the player. I tried it in another player and it worked. I looked in many online forums and found others with the same problem. Apparently it has something to do with the new Sony ARccOS copy protection on this DVD. It is supposed to prevent people from copying the DVD on a PC (but I read that software to defeat this came out one day before the first DVD with this ArccOS was released)."
4,Pretty Good---,"I expected this movie to just be some lame flick with no real value, but if that what you think about it as well just give the movie a chance. It has really good suspence, and a really creepy twist. Its really good!!"
2,Maybe I am the one who is crazy...,"Can someone please let me know if I am crazy? Granted, the whole movie made me feel edgy and paranoid but I swear in the TV version I saw last night, the heroine's son, Sam, was reported to be ""killed in a bus crash in Brooklyn"". Several characters said those words, most notably Alfre Woodard's police investigator character. Yet in every review I can find, the writer of the review states that Sam died in a plane crash. Am I going nuts or was this alternate version of the movie different in other ways besides the ending? Anyone?"
2,M O T I O N BLUUUURRRRRRIINNNNGGGGGGG.,THIS MOVIE IS ALMOST UNWATCHABLE; UNLESS THE ACTORS ARE STANDING STILL! OUT OFFOCUS AND MOTION BLURRING. I CAN SEE WHY THEY HAVE IT FOR ONLY 99 CENTS. BUYTHE DVD OR RENT IT FROM ITUNES.
3,Good acting in a mediocre movie,"Julianne Moore rarely gives a bad performance. It's amazing to watch her in this film brilliantly rejuvenating crappy dialogue and stupid plot turns. Dominic West does a decent job as well. The chemistry between the two is established nicely. Along with the performances by the film's stars, some of the special effects are truly great. ""The X-Files"" could have learned a lot from this film in the effects department. Otherwise, this is an easily forgotten movie.The film starts off with a great premise: A woman mourns the death of her son through emotional rituals lasting over a year. Shortly into the film, she is told that she never had a son, that her memories of him are made up. Sounds like I'm giving away the movie, doesn't it? I would be if the film actually followed such an interesting story. But no, get ready for some conspiracy theory weirdness and a totally out-of-this-world-stupid plot."
2,Pretty forgotten by now.,"The Forgotten starring Julianne Moore and Domnic West is a slow, tepid, and hard to grasp film. The previews for this film were better than the actual movie, I guess that's a bad sign that the movie isn't going to be great (I'll try and remember that next time). The only reason I am giving The Fogotten 2 stars is the scene with Alfe Woodward, you'll know what I mean when it happens, the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere, very intrguing spurprise awaits. Anyways The Forgotten is a movie you should see once and that's it, happy viewing."
2,MISPLACED REACTION!,THIS WAS A VERY INTERESTING MOVIE UNTIL IT WAS OBVIOUS IT WAS ANOTHER ALIEN MOVIE! THE ENDING WAS VERY VERY BAD & BADLY WRITTEN! THE PRODUCER REALLY MESSED THIS ONE UP - THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD MOVIE - MINUS THE ALIENS!
3,"FOR THE MOST PART, IT'S FUN","A GRIEVING MOTHER [JULIANNE MOORE] WHOSE SON DIED IN A PLANE CRASH ALL OF A SUDDEN FINDS HERSELF BEING THE ONLY ONE WHO EVEN REMEMBERS THAT HER SON EXISTED. AN OK PREMISE COUPLED WITH SOME DECENT ACTING SAVES THE FILM FROM BECOMING TOO MEDIOCRE. WHILE NOT A MEMORABLE MOVIE, IT IS WORTH A WATCH IF YOU BECOME BORED OR IF YOU SIMPLY JUST NEED TO KILL SOME TIME."
5,It's not what you think.,"I am amazed. Never have I seen a movie that kept me thrilled. Bravo. I asked myself, ""what is going on?"" throughout the movie, but I was not frustrated. I was so excited that I felt like a child waiting for the gumball to drop. I personally thought the movie would be similar to the movie Contact. It wasn't. I jumped out of my seat twice. And if you seen the movie, you will know exactly when. This movie mixes the best of a captivating murder mystery and an edge of your seat thriller, then drizzles on just the right amount of sci-fi. The movie got better and better. I was on edge the whole ride home."
2,could hardly be dumber,"This movie is really awful. How is it that no one seems to mind plots that would not seem coherent even to a 5-year-old? From the first moment that julianne moore is told she didn't really have a child, one thinks, well that's easy enough to test; if she had a 9 year old child who died a year ago, versus having had a recent miscarriage, she just has to figure out what year it is and how old she is. Of course, as the movie departs further and further from any kind of internal logic or coherence, this idea sinks into the vast sea of stupidity.Add to that that the aliens make people disappear in a way that looks silly and cartoonish, rather than spooky, a score that repeats like a bad jingle until you want to throttle someone, photography so unrelievedly dark that on TV about half of the film is just black, and this one is not even worth the few dollars I paid to see it. Why does everyone tolerate this junk?"
3,here's a good analogy for this movie:,"Ever shake a bottle of soda up really hard? I mean really shake it, hard, fast, with the purest intent of an explosion on some poor unsuspecting sap? You shake & shake & shake, giddy with anticipation for the oh so delicious moment of spraying everything & everyone around you, and you finally remove the cap.......and ....... NOTHING......... COMES......... OUT... maybe a little vapor.... THAT, my friends, is The Forgotten... I think I've already forgotten it! I guess it worked..."
1,Forget the Forgotten,"I wish I could suck everybody who thought this movie up into the sky with a giant vaccum cleaner just like they did in the movie. This movie sucked so bad. At the time it came out, everyone at my job said that it was giving them nightmares after they saw it. Movies don't bug me, so I was expecting something hardcore. Oh it was hardcore alright... hardcore dogsh*t. I have never been so angry at the movie theater in my entire life (besides Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, that sucked as bad as this one). DON'T GET THIS."
3,A Good X-Files Episode,"This was a disappointing movie from the story perspective. The plot was intriguing, acting was great, and special effects were startling, but the answers to the questions were about as challenging as a dream scene. Rent it on a dull night and save your money to buy an M. Night Shamalan movie."
1,Forgetable,"The Forgotten is a movie that wants to be big and extravagent, but fails in one thing - a lack of a plot. Instead the movie is just 2 hours of a crazy plot that goes no where. Dont waste your time."
2,"All powerful aliens in ""Not good at decorating"" shocker...","Starts off good, but at a certain point you must ask yourself why it is that all powerful alien beings are not capable of repainting a wall properly....Give it a miss."
2,"Interesting concept, but the final product is insubstantial","This average supernatural thriller is worth only two and a half sentences from me. The plot is only marginally interesting, and it actually develops much too quickly; the viewer needs more time to get acquainted with the characters."
3,"A not bad sci-fi thriller, a not great movie","The Forgotten is okay. Some parts are much better than others, but it is never boring to the point where you would give up watching through to the end. Julianne Moore is (as usual) great and lifts this movie up due to her perfomance alone. Some good moments, a couple a chills and a less than thrilling conclusion, but worth a viewing if your in the mood for a B-level thriller."
4,Has an unpredictable ending and is scary too,"I really liked this movie. I thought it was as scary as ""Darkness Falls"" and for the scary movie genre it was a stand out because I did not predict the ending. In fact, at a couple of times toward the end of the movie, I thought for sure I knew what was going to happen and both times I was wrong! I knew virtually nothing about the movie before I saw it, other than the trailors. I think that is probably one of the reasons why I liked it so much. If you know about certain aspects of the plot, I could see how you might not like this movie as much. So I'm not going to say a whole lot about the content of the movie beyond what I have already said, for that reason. So, if like me you don't know a whole lot about the plot, I would recommend not reading much about it and just rent it and see what you think."
3,I give this movie some credit...,"I would claim this to be one of my favorite movies if they didn't ruin it in the end with the people stealing kids being aliens! I mean the whole consept of the FBI stealing kids was a great story line (totally scary because it would be believable), but like any truly great movie it had to be ruined by aliens. Which for me didn't work in this movie. I just was disappointed that the acting and story line of missing kids would be overpowered by aliens and their plot. Those of you who enjoy alien stories may enjoy this those of you who didn't know it had aliens unti I said it may want to wait until it comes out on video. It may be something you like or it may disappoint you as it did me."
2,Intriguing premise but leaves you dissatisfied,"This film has a lot going for it but ultimately just doesn't live up to its ambitious premise. The splendid cast can't compensate for the screenplay, which is both too thin and too ambitious. The most intriguing segment of the film was the beginning, where the Julianne Moore character is told that her memories of her nine-year-old son are the result of a post-traumatic psychosis, and we see some good acting as she struggles with this concept. Unfortunately, this is resolved rather quickly and we then plunge into the BIG CONSPIRACY, which struck me as a maddeningly inconsistent hodgepodge derived from many precursors, yet lacking in any unique or ""gee whiz"" special effects. The film leaves a boatload of loose ends and made me nostalgic for some of the stronger contenders in this genre, in which category I would include the stronger episodes of The X Files."
1,Forgettable,"Truth be told, I didn't expect much from ""The Forgotten"" But when it came to one of my favorite theaters where the show is $3 and they have a sourdough philly cheesesteak I figured what have I got to lose? The answer to that is $3 dollars and roughly 2 hours. ""The Forgotten"" is a incredibly bad film. NO ANSWERS are provided to the film's key questions and I'm assuming the logic behind that was ""who wants story when we can make really loud explosions and extended and ridiculous chase sequences? Rent ""Dark City"" instead."
2,A promising beginning -- then pap.,"The Forgotten rings true to its name, with a stunningly lame and forgettable ending that makes your regret having invested even a small amount of time giving it a chance. What begins as a strange and reasonably provocative melodrama of a woman who remembers a child that everyone else believes is a figment of her deranged imagination turns into ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" silliness about a emotionally immature group of emotionally maladjusted aliens who engage in silly experments on a group of generally mediocre actors.Save your self the money and the time."
1,Not what you think,The previews for this movie are so off. It makes this movie sound like its really all that thrilling and its not. I did not favor this movie and I am a thriller fan. I paid for this movie on demand and I want my money back. If i were you I'd only get this movie on netflix..and send it back the day you get it. Its not worth watching twice.
3,it's not that bad but....,Ok so this usually happens. I prepare myself for a bad movie due to the awful reviews and I wind up enjoying the movie. I was mildly entertained by it. It's full of plot holes and things that make you roll your eyes but having said that It's really not that bad of a movie. The leading lady what ever her name is does a very nice acting job as due the other actors. Interesting plot that could have been much better but it's still worth a watch. I wouldnt buy this dvd though. I saw this on cable. I would be interested in seeing the alternate ending but I'm not sure I would even rent this movie now. Catch it on cable if you can. It's really not a horrible movie like some make it out to be.
1,I would like those 2 hours of my life back please.,"This movie held my interest for the first 30 minutes until I had too many questions and not enough answers. As soon as the plot turned supernatural I gave up on it. I would have turned it off if I hadn't rented it with my sister whom wanted to stick it out and see if it improved. It did not. I can't believe I made it as far as the ending, but I did, and that was more ridiculous than the rest of the movie.This movie reminded me of a bad dream where it's dark, nothing makes sense, and you're glad when it's over."
3,Forgettable,"A pretty decent preformance by Moore, a great first-half, and some genuine ""jump"" moments just aren't enough to save ""Forgotten"" from itself.Without giving anything away, ""Forgotten"" takes a left turn in the second half that's so severe and so ridiculous that it's hard to take seriously anymore. At that point, a decent story is driven straight into the ground.There simply wound up being one too many moments when I found myself saying ""They can't be serious?"""
2,"Generally Disapointing, but Nicely Shot","My expectations were not high before seeing this film, but overall it was still a disappointment. Not too frightening, and a real let down of an ending.What I did like about this movie is that it is nicely filmed, with a subtle eerie atmosphere. It's always nice to see beautiful shots of New York City.Some hype has been given to the alternate ending on the DVD. It is better than the theatrical version, but not by much."
1,most horrible movie ever,"ok. im dead serious when i say this... this is the worst movie ive ever seen. ever. no exageratation. this one is right at the bottom of the list resting just underneith darkness falls and jeepers creepers. its sooooo cheesy. i mean... seriously... its got a nice setup... your asking yourself ""does this child even exist?"" etc... it wouldve been a nice psychologocal thriller... but instead? they go for the cheesiest possible ending ive ever seen. ill spare details in case anybody cares about spoilers etc... but honestly... this movie is not worth a glance at the cover let alone a rental or purchase."
1,My money has been TAKEN...,"It is even an ofense to call this completly waste of time a movie. It could have been a so-so episode of The X Files series, but that's it. Completly childish plot with absolutly no concept at all. I warn you, don't waste your precious time and money on this. Go and watch The Sixth Sense again, insted."
4,a good thriler,the forgotten is the best thriller sence the six sence.this movie will make you jump a lot.this movie was vary suspenceful.but it ended sort of weird.if you like movies from night shamalan that you never guess how it will end then you will like this movie.
5,awesome movie,this was one of the best movie ive ever seen. that has alot of suspense scenes too it.

4,Little Bosch handheld router,This little router is very nice. It is smooth to operate and has plenty of power to handle more than other handhelds we have had in the shop before. The only thng I wish was different is the fiels of vision. The plate hole could be a little bigger because we freehand alot of stuff and need to see what were doing.
4,Use in cnc application,"Not a bad little router. Im currently on my second Colt. The first one has been retired after a years use due to bearing runout for small edge roundovers and such. I use the Colt for my cnc unit and works well other than being very loud and only having one indent for shaft lock. An alternative is the new Dewalt 611 it's a little more but also 1.1/4 HP with multible shaft indent, I will probly give it a shot next replacment."
3,Changing the bit is horrible,"The router is good to use if you do not have to change the bit often. Pushing and holding in the locking mechanism as you loosen the collet is a challenge. If you tighten the bit ""too tight"", you might as well say ""foget it"" and just weld the bit to the motor because you are not going to remove the bit.I use my round-over bit all of the time within the router. I keep the base at the right height so that I don't have to keep fussing with the settings when I use it again. Although, when you place the router within the case, you have to reduce the base to make it fit. This means the settings are messed up again. The design of the case does not give you the flexiblity to leave the height as is.Overall, so-so router. There are many others out there, I would keep looking."
3,Wait to the next version!!!,I have this Colt over a year - wonderful tool BUT1. Shaft Locking button is poor and doesn't lock good2. Bit is not strait! The fix base is moving after lock.I am sure that Bosch will fix these problems soon...SO BUY THE NEXT AND THE IMPROVED VERSIONI will stay with mine
3,I like the dewat DWp611 better,"Although this is a good tool it has it's issues.I have a lot of routers,this one, 2-DW 625 3hp's, Bosch 2hp,older Makita 1.5 HP,Hitachi 2HP, DWP611 1.25HP.I have to say the little Bosch is good but when you compare it to the DWP611 it is not as easy to adjust (actually kind of a pain sometimes)and it doesn't have the LED's I don't think much of the case either."
5,Palm Router,This has to be the handiest tool in my shop. It fits my hand comfortably and is very easy to use. Great tool.
2,Disappointing Bosch trimmer,"I have four full size routers already. This is added just for very light jobs like edge trimming but my plan has gone totally wrong.This trimmer is very powerful. I mean, it actually has too much power on this small size that it vibrates too much and noise level is very high. So it's not easy to handle due to noise and vibration.Also the locking lever for housing is loose, it often causes the base moving back, so the depth changes in the middle of routing. I tighten the nut then it's ok. But I cannot move the housing until I losen the nut again. Locking lever for housing is not strong enough and should be redesigned.When I found the problem, too late to return it. I'm going to sell it as a used one."
1,most worthless tool in 20 years,"I have had the tool for about 6 months and used it twice. Tonight I went to use it as a substitute for a laminate trimmer and it ""stalled"" ,,, as the manual says ,, then failed to turn on 15 minutes later. The tool is now in the dumpster and will be the last bosch purchase I make in the router department most definately. I have been in cabinetmaking for 20 years and this is the largest flat out waste of money I have had."
1,Two thumbs down.,"No stars for this router. It has a funky adjusting mechanism to adjust the depth of the router bit. You release a lock, twist the housing to the unlock position, then move the base up or down, then twist the housing back to the lock positon, then engage the locking lever. I have a little over an hour of actual use and the adjusting system is beyond redemption. I turn on the router and the vibration causes the base to slip. I can't lock the router bit in place. The router is now useless."
2,Didnt even get to use it before it was broken,The lockout for changing bits from the minute I opened the box. very dissapointed. Its too bad cause the router works real well but It doesnt help that I cant change th bit now.
5,Doesn't get any better than this.,"This little tool is a pleasure to use. Has fast become my ""go to"" router for edge work - much simpler than dragging out the big one for such a quick job. I've owned a couple, and this one is the best yet. I highly recommend this for any pro or hobby shop."
3,Nice Small Router,"I haven't used it much yet, but it is the usual good Bosch quality. It does have one major flaw. The base is seldom perpendicular (at right angles) to the chuck. Finewoodworking magazine mentioned that this could be corrected by shimming the sub-base, but I found that the method of tightening the base to the motor does not give a consistant angle for shimming. The router would still be useful for laminate trimming and small edge moulding, but precision rabbetts and dadoes will require checking the perpendicular alignment after each height adjustment. I'm a little disappointed, but will be keeping it anyway."
3,Need a second wrench,"Great little router but if you plan on changing bits you need to have a second wrench. The little red button doesnt hold at all when trying to loosen the bit. It works fine for tightening it but good luck taking the bit out. You have to get another wrench, like most routers, only problem is you can't fine one thin enough to fit in that grove...must file down a perfectly good wrench....what a design flaw..."
5,Why Didn't I Get One Sooner,"I read a review by WOOD magazine about trim routers and with a project I had coming up I bought this router (WOOD's Top Tool) and I am wondering why I didn't get one sooner. This router makes rounding over edges a breeze and to cut a shallow mortise - WOW.The small size and weight makes this tool very easy to handle and control. Balance was not a problem. The storage case has room in it to store the various attachments that you can purchase for this router. Bit changes and depth adjustments are easy to accomplish. I have not used the edge guide yet to see how that works.Overall, I can not see where a person could go wrong with this router."
1,"Great router, One serious problem","I'd give it five stars if I never had to change the router bit. I've had it less than a year and the spindle lock is trashed. If there is a manufacturer out there that still makes tools that last longer than a couple years, I'd like to know who they are. It's sad to say but lately I'd have to rank Bosch tools up there with the DeWalt junk."
2,Down and out in less than a year,"I own many Bosch tools, including a plunge router, a router table, a Bulldog, a rotary cutter, and other stuff--and this is the first disappointment. The collet lock gave out in less than a year, and it's now dead. While I'm at it, I never liked the bit height adjustment; it's clumsy. Also, this is a trim router, small and lightweight but powerful for its job, but it's challenging to view the bit as you're cutting."
2,Item overheating,I previously used a Bosch colt for a CNC machine. After a couple hundred hours of use it began to run hot. The lower bearings had finally failed. I ordered a replacement colt and tested upon receipt. It failed due to overheating after just a minute of testing. Returned item and received a replacement and it too overheated after just a minute of use and vibrated badly at higher speed settings. I am returning for a refund and purchasing a Dewalt 611 as it is the only alternate router that will fit the CNC Shark with minimal hassle.
5,Great support for my bench router,"Using my traditional router for smaller applications was always a challenge as it is a bit awkward and somewhat bulky. As well, I was considering the purchas of a laminate trimmer. Along comes Colt from Bosch and my needs are met -- an easy to manoever router that doubles as a laminate trimmer. Smooth running with variable speed and SoftStart, and along with the single wrench bit fastening it's a pleasure to use. 1hp is enough for smaller applications and I don't have to keep removing and re-installing my old router off/on the table. Solid construction. A great product."
2,I returned mine,"Like many others here I had problmes with installing and uninstalling bits using the lock button. It slipped so bad on the first one I got I thought for sure it was defective and returned it within an hour. The second one was better in that I could lock the spindel for a bit insert. I couldn't however get the bit out without taking off the base and using two wrenches. The locking button didn't lock anything going the other way. Not the convienence I expected and since the button is plastic it would have surely gotten worse as it wore down. I also had the base collapse damaging my project and then had a bit fly off ruining an expensive piece of material (not to mention the gouge in my stomach). I sent the second one back too. I've previously had real good luck with Bosch products, especially their jig saw, and will buy their stuff again, just not this item."
1,Bit Slipped Once but Nice Otherwise,"The router is very powerful for its size and just awesome in a lot of ways. I would definately buy anothe one. While there are a lot of nice features I wish there was a better mechanism for preventing the bit from slipping. I was routing a number of mortises with a template and the flush trim bit insidiously slid from a 1/2"" depth to nearly 7/8"" depth over the morning. I had tightened the bit as tight as I could with the supplied wrench before doing the work. Now I will have to fill and re-do the mortises. Bad on me for not noticing sooner but also bad (I believe) on the manufacturer for not making this better. As a home hobbiest I am certainly not an expert carpenter, but I'm usually decently inclined to mechanical stuff and I don't think I did anything wrong in securing the bit."
3,poor first impression,"the size and power are great. The supplied collet wrench doesn't fit the collet nut and the shaft lock, presumably to allow one wrench bit changes, is difficult to hold and slips with pressure on the collet nut.I'll see how things go in future use but..."
4,Not pefect but great!,"I agree with the previous review that the base is not exactly perpendicular to the bit. This can cause some problems if you are doing precision routing. I may have to come up with a shim and raise one side of the base plate to compensate for this error. What a PITA!!!I'm looking for a collet that will accommodate 1/8"" bits. Anyone have any ideas? I tried the 1/8"" collet from the RotoZip but the thread pattern did not match the Colt's. (UPDATE: I tried a 1/8"" collet from Ryobi one+ Speed Saw and it fit perfect!!!)Besides these setbacks, this is one nice hand-held router. The motor has a soft start which prevents the initial kick. Variable speed is a nice bonus when using different size bits. The barrel feels very comfortable in my palm and is easy to maneuver -- points for safety. Bit change is a breeze with the spindle lock.Great for making dovetails, mortises and pattern cutting."
3,"Nice router, but shaft not perpendicular to base","This is a nice router, but I agree with many who said the base isn't perpendicular to the shaft. I returned it and got another one and it was about the same. I decided to keep it, I shimmed the base .030inches with a couple washers. Works fine now.I made sure it was twisted to the lock position, I adjusted the clamp tight, then looser with no change.By the way, Amazon was great. Exchanged it no problem. Very fast shipment of replacement. Amazon is always my first choice when it comes to ordering something online. Everything is usually fine but on the rare occasion that there is an issue, they have always taken care of me.Thanks Amazon!"
4,Handy for making a completed project safe,"This router proved very handy for rounding over sharp edges I had missed when preparing materials for a climbing tower for my grandchildren. Lightweight and easy to grip, it was the right tool for reaching high overhead or into tight spots. After several minutes of use, though, the tool warmed up enough that the height/depth adjustment would not hold its setting. I had to let the tool cool, and then it was fine again."
2,Horrible removing bits,"I am now looking into purchasing another laminate trimmer to replace this lousy Bosch Colt. I have simply had it with the absolutely useless system for removing bits. The spring-loaded shaft lock simply is too difficult to use given how stuck the bits become after use. I found I had to remove the base, clamp the body of the router to a table and use both wrenches included with the router to get the bit out of the shaft. It is nice that they include both wrenches, as that is essentially the ONLY way you will get bits out of the shaft.Do yourself a favor and look into other laminate trimmers. If I find one that is easier to use, I will update this review with that information."
5,It did the job!,"I purchased this router to cut hinge gains for a jewelry box I was making. In the past, I had just used a chisel to cut the gains. I heard from a friend that using a small router was much easier and produced clean results. Using the router and a 3/16 up spiral bit, I was able to cut two hinge gains in no time. I had a little difficulty fine tuning the depth of cut, but eventually got the hang of it. The router was very easy to control and the hinge gains look great!"
4,Small and Super Sharp,This is my new EDC knife I and I really like it. Because is is so thin it takes a little practice getting used to the opening mechanism. Once get the hang of it deploying the knife one-handed is no problem at all.
5,Great Knife,"Bought this knife for the Made in USA quality, and it stands up to it's name. the locking mechanism as well as the reversible clip make this knife both safe and practical. Be careful, the knife is extreemly sharp, and if it ever becomes dull, Kershaw stands up to their name to sharpen it for you free of charge minus shipping. Overall great buy, great knife and Trusted brand."
5,Damn this thing is sharp!,"They weren't joking when they said this knife was sharp. I was closing it with one hand and my finger accidentally pushed slightly on the blade and it cut me pretty good. It was a good enough cut to make me bleed for a good hour!Despite the knife trying to kill me, it's amazing. One of the best made knifes I've ever used! My only issue is the assisted opening mechanism on it. You really have to be careful when opening and closing the knife because it can pop open right away if you don't stop it."
5,sleek and sexy!,"Excellent. Some knocked this knife for being too smooth and not textured like if you had to use it with gloves. Please. There are other Kershaw models that fit the bill if you are looking for that. But if you are looking for sleek and sexy knife to take out on a casual day this is it. I consider this an old school, 'Sunday church' type of knife if you know what I mean. I was amazed how well it felt and looked. If I was going out for a heavy work day in the woods, I would leave this knife at home and grab something alittle more suited for that (which Kershaw makes). Get it!"
4,Sexiest Knife You Will Ever Own ;),"This is by far the most aesthetically pleasing knife I have ever owned. The body is not so much silver (as seen in the pictures) as it is light grey. I noticed that the clip interferes with the already hard-to-grasp body, so I removed the clip very easily with a small screwdriver. After removing it, the grip was very good. After watching some reviews on YouTube I assumed it would be extremely easy for the flipper to be activated; not quite. It actually takes a bit of force to get the flipper to open the blade. However, this could be due to the knife being less than a day old :PMy only gripe with this knife is I find it very difficult to completely open the knife using the thumb stud; I think the stud is too close to the body of the knife to allow for an easy opening system. Hopefully with time it will become easier. That is the only reason I gave this knife a 4/5.Overall, great EDC knife, it will see a lot of carry."
5,"Excellent, Handy Little Knife","I bought this kife as a pocket knife for mostly fishing. After using it for a year or so, I'm impressed by its ability to keep an edge. I really like it, and would recommend to all."
4,Good Knife!,"This 3 1/2"" bladed knife is well designed,has a sturdy blade and easy to use. Can be opened one handed, either w/ the thumb stud or the back blade strike. The locking slide at the end of the Knife, secures the blade against unwanted openings. It's light and yet rugged."
5,4 1/2,"This is a slick knife. It is really sharp. It cuts tomatoes really well. And I love the way it looks. Not the mention the speed at which the blade flings out!Also, from what I have researched, it is totally legal in CA (as of this review date, 12/25/2011).And they offer complimentary lifetime sharpening (just ship it to them).I would give it 4.5 stars if possible, though, because it feels a little small in my hand (not the blade; the knife itself). I have average-sized hands and feel I can never get as strong of a grip on it as I would like for when I'm opening it one-handed, especially considering the momentum generated when using the assisted opening system. The first couple of times I tried it it felt like the whole knife was about to jump out of my hand!"
4,"Good, compact knife","I got one of these knives after my brother had one and I liked how fast it opened. I got the serrated version. The blade is very sharp and the blade opens very fast. It fits very well in your pocket and isn't bulky at all. The only downside I've noticed is that if your hands are wet or if your fingers are coated with something, the knife is hard to grip and difficult to open. But that's the only downside. Some type of rubber grip would have been better, but for the price, you get a small, convenient, fast opening sharp blade."
4,Great Everyday Carry Knife,"I have this with the smooth blade in sunburst pink. This is a high quality durable item. I would recommend this to anyone. The speed safe opening mechanism is great. The blade is high quality, it is both strong and sharp. I haven't found anything I've needed to cut that this wouldn't cut. I've had this knife for over six months now and I'm very pleased with it.The only problem is that it falls out of my pocket often despite the clip (I believe this happens because women's jeans have shallower pockets than men's jeans). When it falls out of my pocket and hits the floor it springs open if you don't have the plastic locking mechanism engaged. I have dropped mine so many times that the plastic mechanism is broken. If you're not careful this could be safety hazard, this is the only reason it doesn't get a five star."
2,Pretty knife but deceiving,"When I got it, I was surprised by the weight and how slim it was. I was quite excited to open it, needless to say but when I opened it, it stopped half way. I thought that was weird and attempted to replicate it again. Yep, the bearing seems to be bad in this knife and I'm in no mood to take it apart and babysit something that should've been done right the first time in the factory. But curiosity got a hold of me and I took my Teeny Turner screw and see if I could tinker with it a little. I was surprised to realize the screw was VERY loose, not even tighten all the way in. In fact, it was sticking out of the side of the knife.So basically I have a lemon of a knife despite how pretty this design is.I'm returning it. Meh..."
5,Great knife,This is a great knife. It has kept its edge and operates as advertised. The only problem I have is when opening I don't feel as if I have a firm grip in order to insure I don't impede the blade and cut myself. I am getting use to that aspect however.
2,Serious good stuff...But too good to last long.,"This knife is AMAZING!!!! It is so darn cool that you get addicted to it in seconds!!The problem is that I flipped it open so much that I broke the spring or something. :(Also the clip is not so amazing. I lost my first on a hike. :( I had to send in my current one twice for a spring repair. The second time I had it repaired, I told myself. ""Do not open this too much"" and guess what happened...It's broken now..It's a 5 star knife if you love it enough not to have fun with it..... :\"
5,Great Everyday knife!,"I have many kershaw products, they all serve a purpose and all do their respectable jobs well. I used to carry the chive for my everyday pocket knife, but i upgraded to the leek for everyday carry plus personal defense. It is a smooth knife, opens well, good weight, good shape, good and sharp, easy to resharpen and not gonna break the bank.I would easily replace this with another one if i lost it. I don't have to worry about it breaking, i've broken a few kershaws in the past from negligence and they always rent me a new knife for no charge (minus shipping) The turn around time was about a week and they even sent me an extra new knife as a gift of appreciation. Go ahead and get this, its a great price, for a great knife that will last longer then you."
3,"Great so far, BUT","I just received my knife and like it a lot, BUT, the first thing I wanted to do, after learning how to use it, was to take off the pocket clip. At first glance, it's held on by very small phillips screws, but it turns out to be tiny allen head screws. Who has those size wrenches? You would think they would spend a few cents to include the tiny wrench necessary to remove the clip, especially since one of their selling points is that the clip is ""easily"" reversible!!"
2,speed safe poor quality,"While this is a greart knife and my son loves it, after only two weeks the speed safe know longer works. It appears to be a plastic stop and has bent, no longer keeping the blade safe inside the knife, we plan to exchange it and if it happens again, look for another knife."
1,"AMAZON IS FASCIST, WONT SELL TO NY RESIDENTS NOT IN NYC!!!","I WILL NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON AGAIN. THIS KNIFE IS LEGAL TO HAVE AND CARRY IN NY. JUST NOT NYC. I DONT EVEN LIVE CLOSE TO THE CITY!!! THIS IS BLOCKING MY FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO BUY AND OWN A KNIFE WHICH IS LEGAL WHERE I RESIDE. I BOUGHT THIS FOR $10 MORE SOMEWHERE ELSE, THE KNIFE IS 5 STARS AND AWESOME, SHARP, FAST, LOOKS SLICK AND IS DURABLE. AMAZON, YOU NEED TO STOP THINKING WE LIVE IN CHINA."
4,Good knife for the price,"I bought two (one for me and one for the Missus) for general purpose use. So far the edges are sharp/functional and the blade is easy to deploy. Time will tell if it will hold it's edge over many sharpenings. The only issue I saw was that one Onion deployed it's blade easier than the other, so I gave that one to my Wife. Hopefully mine will loosen up over time so I don't have to take it apart and fix it myself. I gave four stars because one was perfect and the second only had that issue with blade deployment."
5,Ready out of the box.,"Cool little pocket knife. I haven't used it enough to know if it will hold an edge but considering what I paid, it will be getting lots of use. It is a stainless steel knife so I wouldn't test the grippyness.Pros:It snaps open lightning fast, appears strong and sharp enough.It is slim/sleek and hardly noticeable in my jean pocket. I've some that were bulky, not this model.Cons:It has a lock. I hate knives with locks."
5,Great knife!,"Great knife for a good price. Comes nice and sharp, I love how you can open it quickly with one hand. Highly recommend."
3,"Great Little Knife, but...","I received one of these knives as a gift not too long ago, and proceeded to lose it within two weeks. I ordered a replacement on Amazon and was happy to find out that I ordered the exact same knife (I didn't have the box and wasn't sure of the model name).I would give it 5 stars for sharpness, appearance and how light and slim it is. But, the one I received doesn't open very smoothly and it doesn't always lock into the open position. I tried lubing it a little and it didn't help. I'm going to take it apart and lube it and see what happens, but I do feel with a knife this sharp, it should function properly out of the box. If I hadn't owned a few low quality knives in my life, I may have cut myself before I realized that it wasn't securely locked open."
5,Perfect Pocket Knife,"Great everyday pocket knife, slim and small yet large enough for most jobs. High quality and has a VERY sharp edge. Be sure to use the safety lock if you wear somewhat tight pants as the pressure can open the blade and ruin your pants. The safety lock is made of plastic and if you close the blade on it several times, it will break. I did this and called Kershaw, they send me several replacement locks and screws for free, no questions asked. I asked the customer service rep why it was made of plastic and not metal like the rest of the knife, and what he said made a lot of sense. He said ""Well it’s less expensive to replace a plastic safety then the whole blade since the lock is located near the tip of the blade, a metal lock could break off the tip if accidently closed too hard on it."" Excellent knife, excellent customer service, couldn’t be happier with it."
5,A great knife for folks who are handicapped,"Kershaw Ken Onion Leek Folding Knife with Speed SafeI purchased a different knife 1st, however, I had to return it as it was a gravity `flip' knife, and with my other muscle problems plus arthritis, it may have well have just been a folding knife. This knife however, is `spring loaded'....a distinction I knew nothing about. This knife opens with very little pressure, and is perfect for me to work in the garden, remove labels to shred from boxes before throwing them out, a host of things you don't want to use a steak knife on. The return was a snap, and delivery on this knife quick as always. This is not as `cool' a looking knife as others, but I didn't buy it to show off. I give it a 5 out of five. How it holds it's edge is yet to be determined."
5,Can't go wrong here.,"$60 at Cabela's, so this is the right place to get it. Not much to say, though. Sharp as a razor. Compact. Perfect size for a pocket knife. Switchblade action smooth and tight."
4,Best Knife Ever! (almost),"now after having this knife for only 2 weeks, the blade lock snapped off. Days later, it fell out of my pocket, and i lost it for good, as the clip doesn't wear very deep. so, i bought a second one and i am pleased to say that this is almost the best knife ever, but could be better if only the handles were less slippery and the lock were sturdier. This is why you should spend 2x the money on this one, and Buy the one with G10 handscales. otherwise, Best knife ever!"
4,Great knife for anyone,"Bought this knife to replace my old knife whose tip broke off. The spring assisted mecahnism took a little time to get use to and the knife as a whole is a little small in my hands (6ft 2in, over 200lb man) but the knife itself is great. Has a lock on the base of the knife to prevent it from opening while in your pocket (which can easily be released on handedly). To switch the direction of the clip I really had to look around for a small enough star-allen wrench, but as a whole this knife is excellent. Really like the slim design compared to other knives of the same size."
5,Solid and reliable,"The first thing you notice about the Leek is how well it's built. The frame is sturdy and solid and the blade doesn't rattle around or anything. The action on the spring-assisted opening is super smooth and extra fast. It may surprise you the first time you use it!The edge it comes with is very nice and it has held well over some medium-heavy use over the last few weeks. Overall, it's a very solid, compact pocket knife that is great for every day use. Definitely recommended!"
3,good,"i love the knife, the shape the feel, but the blade is starting to rust in spotts i keep it in my pocket and i sweat alot (working on the railroad) i dont know if this is a defect or if i am just not supposto get the blade wet at all. that kinda defeats the purpose of oating a pocket knife in my opinion."
5,Great Gift,"I have the Kershaw Shallot (also Ken Onion) with a beautiful damascus blade.Kershaw Assisted Opening Damascus Shallot Pocket KnifeWe bought this Leek as a Christmas gift for my father in law. He loves it. As expected, it was sharp as a razor, right out of the box. Fit and function was well done, and he loves the Speed Safe opening feature. This was a great product at a good price."
5,Great for daily use,"I know some people look at this as a type of fighting knife, but in reality it is something I use every day to open packages, cut bubble wrap to send packages. I also have the chive which I found useful the other day to open the foil on a jar of peanuts in my car, good to be able to use one hand only to open the knife.Works perfectly every time. Gave one to my son(30 year old son, not a little boy) as a gift."
5,Best knife ever!!!!!,This is the 3rd one I have bought and can't live without it. I always have it in my pocket and it is great for one hand use. I mainly use it for work but it is so handy for any use it is the only knife I carry for daily use.
4,good knife,Really like the knife very sharp but tips so sharp and thin its kindof flimsy. just wouldnt cut anything too hard
4,Great knife,"This is a great knife. The smoothness and quickness of the opening mechanism is truly impressive and will surprise you the first time you do it correctly.My only negative is the safety lock; mine is hard to unlock with one hand. Perhaps some adjustment will take care of that, still very happy with it."
5,Easy Flip Open,"Bought this last year for a christmas present to my brother. On a trip to Texas this year, he lost it and longed for it the whole ride home--he really likes it."
5,Great knife,"I bought this knife after months of reading reviews, and it's everything I wanted. I thought for a long time that I was going to purchase a sog twitch 2 and I'm glad I didn't. My brother bought the twitch 2 and the leek puts it to shame. It has such a smooth deploy. The only downfall of this knife is that if you carry it tip up then it can potentially fall out because it doesn't ride deep enough in the pocket. It only happened to me once, but that made me reverse my clip. Overall I would definitely recommend this knife to anyone!"
5,Best knife i've ever owned,"This is by far the best knife I have ever owned. It is very solid and well built. When you hold the knife it feels sturdy in your hand. The way the knife opens is smooth and effortless. Just apply a little pressure with your index finger and the blade is out and locked into place in a second. The blade is VERY sharp, it can cut paper, plastics (thick or thin) like butter without dulling. The frame lock is sturdy and I would never but another knife without it. The belt clip is great and can be attached to either side of the knife. As far as I can tell this is the highest quality knife I have ever owned. I do not anticipate having to purchase any other knife for a long time, unless I lose this one."
5,Beautiful knife well made & quite handy.,"Very nice knife i have collected quite few knives thus far over time an this would have to be one of the best, the quick easy of opening the knife is very nice, but need to be sure to continue upkeep of maintance for continued performance as with any knife."
3,"Decent, not great",Seems to have a torsion bar that is weaker than my other Kershaw Speed Safe knives. Other than that it is a decent EDC. Good size and comfortable in your pocket.
2,Locking mechanism not well designed,"Knife is ok for a basic stainless steel blade. I've only had it two days so I can't comment on the durability. The auto open 'speed safe' functions well, opens simply, quickly and easily.My main gripe is the frame/thumb lock, which is a major deal. If you squeeze the handle hard (eg if you're really cutting something) then the frame lock goes in so far that it touches the other side of the frame and jams. I have to stick my car key in to open it again. I've have lots of knives and I thought Kershaw was a decent brand. I'm not saying they're junk (this is my first Kershaw knife) but if they are generally high quality then this is not a good example of their product. I'll stick to SpyderCo and Benchmade, neither of which have let me down yet.If you want to use this casually, to open boxes or cut string, then this is an ok deal. If you want a dependable knife for camping, etc, then I'd avoid it."
5,Best knife I've ever owned,"I'm not a weird knife collector or anything but I believe when you pay good money, a well-known product will last a long, long time if you take care of it. I always wipe the natural oils from my hands off before I slip it back in my pocket.I had originally looked for an automatic knife but found they were illegal in my state (and looks like most), so I decided to go with this speed ""assisted"" knife. It is -almost- automatic. With a flick of the little bump on the outside it slaps and locks open.I thought the straight blade would be weird but it is very beautiful. Came very sharp, haven't had to sharpen it yet.Buy with confidence, another great Kershaw blade!"
2,Meh..,"Good: Very sharp out of the box, slender, very light. Bad: Blade seems too heavy for the assist spring to properly open to lock 100% of time, adjusting the pivot to make opening easier made lock up too loose. Blade heavily favors one side when closed, scrapes against inside of frame opposite the liner lock."
5,Great knife,"Just picked one of these up and I'm incredibly happy with my purchase. As others have said, the knife comes razor sharp out of the box and keeps its edge very well. The tip is pin-sharp and does make me a little nervous that I'm going to snap it off, but makes very detailed work a breeze.Speedsafe system is awesome! The flipper deploys the blade quickly and easily. The thumbstuds, for me anyway, seem to be a little more difficult to apply enough pressure to overcome the closing force of the spring. This is a very minor problem as I usually use the flipper anyway.Great knife, especially for the price. Will be picking up a couple more in the future. One will probably be a random leek, love the tanto blade."
5,skip,love the ken onion knife w/ speed safe. I've had 2 long knifes and 2 short types. long one is so much easier to sharpen. price was right shipping packaging could not be better. Would recommend this brand and amazon to anyone.
4,Good EDC Knife,"It's a very sturdy and well-made knife, my only gripe about this knife is the handle. Its very slim and sleek metal design can make it dangerous to use if your hands are wet or covered with anything else that can act as a lubricant. I would've liked some kind of texturing on the handle but overall it is a good knife that I recommend for EDC and self-defense but nothing more demanding or you may find yourself with a nice gash on your hand or a broken knife."
5,Good Knife,"I have had Ken Onion knives before, so I know what I was getting. Nice and simple, good assisted opening, same quirky safety as his others. It needs to break in a little for assisted opening action to work at its optimum. Basic design is a little slick, so it is not super easy to hold on to but I wanted the slimmer profile. If you are getting this for self defense, you may want a different grip."
5,Excellent!,All I can say is be careful closing it. It's at least as sharp as the finest Chef's knives that I own.
3,Kerflaws leek.,I'm giving this three stars for two reasons. #1 this is a USA blade I have plenty of kershaw knives and this one was so dull out of the box I'd be lucky enough to cut butter. Secondly the handle and pocket clip are so smooth it seems like it would fall out of your pocket quite easily. I'm not getting rid of the knife because I love it and I love the feel. I am just a little unhappy that the blade was dull. That was a easy fix. As far as the pocket clip I'll have to figure out how to make some traction so it doesn't fall out. I love kershaw never diiked any of thoer knives until now. Don't get me wrong I still love this knive and plan on using it as my edc but first I want to make sure it doesn't fall out of my pocket
3,Great knife... not new.,"I will be brief. I got my Leek in a week. Was listed 'new', got it ""used-like new"". A few very small nicks in the resharpened blade, and grime in the screw holes and joints. This I know is not Kershaw's fault, and my 3 stars only represent the mis-information given by the seller. It on the hand a pocket knife, and I plan to scratch it up plenty in my chores around the house, so I won't get too crazy. Not worth sending back or anything.As for the knife? It's as nice as the reviews say it should be. Kershaw gets 5 stars on this knife. Even slightly used. Opens nicely. Seems very solid. And it's made in the USA. People write odd reviews about the ""safety being plastic"" or ""staining blades"". I think they are nuts. It seems to be a well made knife, and I don't have to speak Mandarin to get a replacement. I'll order another, not because I need one or because I am a collector, but because I want the company to know I appreciate American made products. That's all. Next."
4,Kershaw Ken Onion Leek.,One of the best little pocket knives you can buy for your money. One handed operation leaves you ready for any task at hand. The only issue I have is the safety mechanism is made of flimsy plastic and didn't last more than a month or so. If the knife drops without the safety it has a tendency to open up automatically which can be somewhat dangerous. Other then that it is worth the money. Come on Ken design a better safety for this knife and I will give it 5 Stars.
1,I'm glad nobody has read this book.,"The author claims that her husband couldn't help with the kids or the housework, because God didn't call him to do such things and his talents, were rather, in the business world. I wish God would not call me to do dishes. She also said that if a woman doesn't want to be intimate with her husband because he hurt her feelings, then she is denying him of something he needs. If people take this book to heart, they will be more messed up than they already are. I just flipped through it looking for some morsel of comfort. At least I can say that it made me laugh!"
3,slow to switch and un-intuitive,"we bought this system 3 or so years ago and had it professionally installed. sound is fine for our smallish living room, and even sounds amazing when playing DVDs with true surround sound - like a movie theater. but it is difficult to program for different attributes (sound type, ""night sound"" off or on, and myriad other functions i have yet to figure out). the buttons and their descriptions are tiny and often extremely unclear as to their purpose. also, as other reviewers have noted, the CD/DVD slots don't indicate when it's time to put a CD/DVD in when changing, nor is it easy to figure out which CD/DVD is in which slot. but the worst thing, as far as i'm concerned, is the incredibly LONG amount of time it spends in-between CDs - especially when played on random shuffle as i prefer to do. seems like it gets hung up and cycles almost endlessly. makes me actually reluctant to put a bunch of CDs in and try to listen for any length of time."
1,junk,"We have had to send the unit in 5 times to be repaired, will not play most DVD's, it had been a constant problem every 2-3 months. It may look nice but it is a dresses up piece of junk."
2,Not Impressive,"I got this system thinking that the quality would be very good to excellent. I was extremely disappointed and returned the item to Amazon.com within a month of my purchase. The CD's/DVD's take forever for them to play and the machine doesn't indicate when you stick a disc in and when you wait. There is no carousel for the 5 discs so you have no idea which CD is in which slot at the time. The sound quality is only average. If you are an audiophile, you will be very disappointed. If you don't mind average sounding music but like staying on a budget, this might work for you. It looks nice though."
5,Love it,"Leaves your face feeling hydrated and clean, has a smooth scent! I use it in the shower every morning and keeps my face clean and fresh"
1,Useless,"I don't know how the other reviewers liked it but I would say there is nothing of value in this book.The main complaint is that the authors are too theoretical without giving any practical insights into a problem or the applications. They show the long equations and don't simplify them too much. And they use their own notation eg. feedback factor etc. This forces you to switch out of the way other authors present data.I would go with any of the other classic design books (grey/meyer, razavi etc)background: I have 15+ years experience as a practicing analog IC design engineer."
4,why i like this book,"This is a good book. This was a book that you could sometimes put down and others you couldn't put the book down. The author describes a lot of things well like the area that they live in well, the neighborhood around them.Her older sister, Nicole, was about fourteen and she started to hear voices and they would never go away. She had to keep very busy so that they wouldn?t bug her as much. The voices made her do crazy things. Nicole is scared that sophy, her younger sister, will also hear the voices because she is now fourteen. Nicole was lucky that her younger sister never got the voices.Although this story was sad, it was still good. Plenty of young people would enjoy this book and could also relate to it."
2,I really didn't like this book.,This book actually wouldn't be something that I would choose to read. It just didn't interest me that much.i didn't really get it. they used really big words and confusing sentences. i like fun books not scary. i like the types of books that make you laugh in some parts and not scare you.this book didn't make me want to keep reading. i wanted to stop but i didn't because i thought that it would be better if i kept on reading but it didn't get better. i have read better books and if i had the chance i wouldn't read it again.
3,"Good to get another chance at this series, but","is anyone ever going to issue mono versions (which after all were mostly what we heard on the radio when these songs were in the charts?)BTW I take it this issue has the same tracklist posted on other Amazon sites, so I have copied it here for convenience1. Teardrop By Teardrop2. Mecca3. Cornflower Blue4. Not Responsible5. The Angels Got Together6. Don'T Let The Neighbors Know7. The Ship True Love Goodbye8. House Without Windows9. Aladdin'S Lamp10.

4,"""Ship True Love Goodbye""","Wow! This song is not on any other compilation i have seen. Killer teen song. Rest of the cd is good also, no other voice like Gene Pitney"
2,Worked but broke on first use,"I am giving this item 2 stars because it actually did dry the petals I used it for. However, one of the wooden outside pieces cracked and broke the very first time I used it, so I had to return it. Perhaps it was just that particular one, but I think it might be a design flaw. The problem was that the wooden peice appeared to be several pieces of wood glued together side by side, rather than a single solid piece of wood. Since you crank down the screws in the four corners of the wooden pieces, too much pressure was put on that glued joint.I will not purchase another one of these, since I think the results would be the same - even if it didn't break on the very first use next time."
2,Product broke first time used,At first I thought this product was great but after the first time I used it it broke right down the middle and I am sending it back.
1,Unplayable DVD from unresponsive seller,"When I received the DVD, I tried to play it. It kept stating ""disc error"". I tried to play it on three different players with the same result.I tried to contact seller. I wrote him four different emails over a two week period. I have yet to receive an answer.I finally had to register a complaint with Amazon, which is still under investigation. I don't know how long it will take to receive my money back."
2,umm,"I've seen the original copy of this, I just wish I knew that this was not that copy. I would have never bought it"
1,Sucked,Did not meet expectation. It was not the video I was looking for that you can watch every seen in full.
3,So So,"After buying this movie, I later found out there was another (better) version. I would recommend finding the other version. This movie is still fun and cheesy though :)"
2,Obviously Edited,This is obviously edited. My boyfriend didnt rent it for its funny lines... What a waste of time and money
2,Not what i expected,"From what I had heard about this movie and from the awards it's received, I expected something halfway decent. I was wrong. The acting is shocking, even for a porn movie and you see nothing in it but breasts and bums. Plus all this excitement about one of the stars first lesbian encounter??? Big whoop. You see them thrusting together for about five seconds and then that's it. Most of the rest of the scene is on the men watching them. I wish I had read some reviews before I bought this DVD as I would have saved my money."
2,not a porn nor an action movie,"I saw Jesse Jone in E Channel advertising her new ""supossedly"" porn movie. She's hot there and I thought this movie would be great if it's really porn.. Anyway, this is the first stuff I bought from Amazon to see if they really send packages. I was frustrated when I started to play this movie, I forwarded it immediately and look for the porn part...Unfortunately, I've never seen one..I just stopped the movie, put it back in the box & put it on my DVD collections..Don't even waste your money buying this stuff..It's a bluff..."
5,One of my favorite things.,"I am not a knife collector. I do not need a knife for self-defense. I need a knife to cut things and I need it to be sharp and easy to get to and use. This knife meets my criteria. The blade is thin which helps with actual cutting, but I would never use it to pry something unless it was a real emergency. Expect the blade to break if you use the knife for anything other than cutting. The knife body is very thin which makes pocket carrying very comfortable. I removed the clip and the knife virtually disappears.The speed safe feature makes the knife. I have a hand strength problem and the assisted opening makes the knife a pleasure to use. It is easy to open and easy to close. The locking feature feels very sturdy and secure and yet is easy to disengage. The size of the knife fills my medium sized hand and feels comfortable to grip. It is hard to imagine a more functional single blade knife than this one. It is very well designed and very well made. I am very pleased."
5,Great buy,"The Kershaw leek is the perfect sized concealed knife for those who do not care to advertise their ""carrying status"" too loudly. As for functionality, the blade is very sharp and well shaped for cutting whatever is needed. Best of all, I have had no problems with rust on this blade, probably due to the black protection coating. Definitely a superior buy for the price asked."
4,Unbeatable for the right price,"First off, this is priced about $10 high on Amazon. I hate shopping at Wal-Mart but they carry these for around $30.The blade on this knife is fantastic and my only complaint about it is that the knife arrives ground to a very fine point which could potentially break easily. After a few sharpenings, I've rounded mine off a bit and haven't had any issues. The knife holds a razor edge well and sharpens easily with a good stone and strop.It opens extremely easily and the safety lock functions as it should to keep it from opening in a pocket. It may be necessary to adjust the screw that the blade hinges on and add some loctite to keep in in place (or just tighten it when it gets loose) but that's a common ""problem"" with assisted opening knives. it can be tightened or loosened to the user's preference, so I consider it a ""feature"" and not a ""bug.""The grip is a bit slick, so it could be difficult to hold at times for some but I haven't had any problems personally."
4,Kershaw Ken Onion Black Leek folding knife.,"An excellent EDC knife. It rides easy in my pocket and is always there when I need it. The blade is thin and very pointed almost like a razor blade and it takes and holds an edge real well. I use it for opening packages, cutting twine, and the like. I have been known to peel apples with it too, so it does a good job as a food prep knife ( like a really good paring knife). Really the only problem with this knife is that my wife has discovered it. She likes the speed safe design and carries it in her purse when she can get it away from me, so we share. She says she feels better knowing that she can use the Speed Safe to keep it closed in her purse and not get cut by accident. I may have to break down and get another."
2,"Dangerous design, too easy for fingers to slide onto blade.","A good knife should be sharp, of course. But it should also be designed so that it's reasonably challenging to cut yourself when closing it. My friend was badly cut by his. You can see that other reviewers here an Amazon were too. Go with Spyderco instead."
4,Great slim knife,"This knife sure has a sharp edge to it. The tip is very fine to dig out splinters or other precise things. Opens fast has a nice safety lock on it and is backed by a great knife company! I can get parts for my American made kershaws in a week. Pocket clips, torsion bar, screws, etc. For $0. I gave it 4 stars because the frame lock on this knife if it happens to not engage over a good amount which it shouldn't enought that it can close on you but it's tricky to fix because you have to tighten the handle and pivot like a code to get it perfect. But you can always send it in to be fixed!"
4,great EDC knife,"Great EDC knife... Light, thin and razor sharp. At first, you might think it's a bit ugly. It'll grow on you. :-)Gave it four stars because it came with the pivot screw set a bit too tight (the knife doesn't open freely) -- which is the same thing I've noticed about other Leeks I've purchased.Regardless, great knife. I've got three of them, and will buy more."
3,Not a bad knife.,"I got this knife for EDC to compliment my CCW. It's not a bad utility knife. I'm only rating it so low for a few reasons:1) It didn't come with a tool for adjusting the pocket clip. this wouldn't have been a big deal, AT ALL, if the screws weren't super tiny hexhead screws. If you're going to use an ultrasmall obscure screw in your product, include a tool. Or use a more common screw type.2) The black finish on the blade is very weak. I used it twice for some very light cutting and the finish came away scuffed looking.3) After using it for light cutting TWICE, and carrying it in my pocket for a few weeks, the frame screw started to work loose. Since the knife did not come with a hexhead tool...I had to improvise.It's not a GREAT knife, but I""m not disappointed in it. For the money it's adequate. Overall it is a well designed knife that holds it's edge decently. I'm not blown away or insanely impressed, but from a utilitarian standpoint, it's good to go."
3,Not good enough,"Already own several Kershaw products - favorite is the Black blur with the same assisted opening mechanism as the leek. Have been looking to replace a lost benchmade for every day carry in a suit, either in the right pocket of the slacks of left pocket of the jacket. Black blur is just too big and is better for a weekend knife. The leek opens great and closes poorly. XL hands will have a tough time closing it as I did. Also, it is way too heavy for it's size. The weight and feel are great - it is a fine piece - until you put it in your pocket. Can't see carrying this as it is too heavy.On the plus side, it is F'ING RAZOR SHARP, you could cut your finger off removing it from the plastic casing."
1,wrong version of knife,"I ordered this knife and received the ""snap on"" edition of it, meaning it has the tool company snap on logo all down the side of the knife. not as pictured or described by amazon."
3,open yes close ?,I like the look and feel and it certainly sharp. I haven't owned one of these type of knives before and maybe for that reason I can't for the life of me figure out how to close it once opened. There doesn't seam any automatic way to disengage it from the locking groove at the front of the knife and since it is so sharp and the handle small I am afraid to put a whole lot of pressure to force it back in to place. So on instinctive operation I give it the 3 stars
2,Gold fever; Americas first gold rush,"A slightly entertaining book. Some history, and some tales. More is written about the trail of tears, than the life and hardships of the gold minor and prospector.If your one goal is to learn or just read about the Georgia gold rush this book falls short. If on the othe hand a little information about goverment policies,broken treaties, and a gold tale interest you, than you may want to purchase this book. It is a very quick read."
4,Slight but significant.,"One hopes Chopra's penchant for the prolific does not dilute the forcefulness of his ideas. This book is a perfect antidote to the ""just say no"" approach to addictive behaviors. The style is friendly, inspirational, delightfully allusive (references ranging from John Milton to Charlie Parker). Still one wishes for more specifics and comprehensiveness. Chopra treats alcohol, tobacco, illegal drugs. What about legally prescribed yet abused drugs"
2,Could Leave People Frustrated,"The author's approach is natural and meditative but lacks a step-by-step strategy. For those looking for steps to recovery, I suggest reading the book, Alcoholics Anonymous. This is THE founding text from which all other 12-step recovery programs began. Believe me, a recovering alcoholic, I found the SOLUTION in the 12-steps and with other recovering people. It saved millions of lives as well as my own."
2,new new info please,Didn't understand. Difficult reading. I think.and I get him. And ekharttoilke. So I am on the pathof enlightment. But difficult. For the common beginners
5,An Addict's Bible!,"This book has been amazingly helpful to me. It is a totally different approach to addiction, but truly seems like the correct and only way to go about it. This book can help you stop your addiction in a way that will last by changing your lifestyle and mindset. At last, an end in sight, and peace."
3,I really didn't like it,This book has recipes that are long and use products that I don't have access to in my rural town. I like short simple recipes that offer a bang for the buck with products I can obtain locally and spices that are common to my kitchen. This is more time consuming and complicated than I like. Too gourmet for me.
2,Good if you have a private chef.,"Lots of fish recipes, no red meat. Plenty of gourmet entrees that seem better suited to someone who wants to spend their time shopping and cooking instead of training. It would be improved with some good basic meals that one could cook simply and then throw in the fridge/freezer for a fast reheat after a long day riding."
1,2nd Edition means many errors,"Recognize that this is only a second edition and that all the bugs have not been worked out yet. I have found several typos, misprints, errored calculations, etc. within this text. Also, the layout is not student friendly. Studying for several hours from this text will cause headaches. It is very difficult to look back in a chapter and find something as the sections don't readily stand out. The authors appear to struggle at times to clarify the issues surrounding a topic. Very often this vague writing leaves the student with the responsibility of deciphering the author's intentions. Also, the errors can cause horrendous confusion. They can be overcome, but only when the student understands the material enough to recognize an error. Overall, this is a fairly poor book especially for those looking to learn advanced accounting. This book should be more accurate as the only change it really recieved is an update concerning the impairment of goodwill."
1,awefully written,this book is undoubtedly awefully written. I normally do not bother to make any comments unless it is beyond bear and forbear. This one fits nicely and consequently got my comment. Can someone write a better book?
3,Good.,"(note to ""a reader"" from April '99: Daniels, judging by a picture on Michigan Poetry Collective's site, is white.)Jim Daniels, M-80 (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1993)I've been mulling this book over in my head for a couple of days now, figuring out what to write about it. I honestly still have no idea. Daniels obviously knows the ins and outs of the craft, and he's certainly capable of writing good, solid poems, which these are. Moreover, they (for the most part) get their messages out of the way and let the images do the talking, like all good poems do.Thus the reason for my confusion. It's a technically fine book of poems, but nothing about it really fired me up, the way a book by someone like Charles Simic or Elizabeth Willis does. The only thing I can really think of to say about it is ""it's good."" But not great. Thus, it would seem, my problem; it doesn't merit effusive praise, nor does it merit disparagement. It's just... good. ***"
2,Obviously self-published,"The content is okay, but the sloppiness of the writing and all the typos are annoying and distracting. The author should fire the editor, except she was his wife, and she is also the very favorable reviewer below named Dr. Pearl Hibbard. I wonder how she reviewed the book when it appears that, as editor, she didn't even read it."
5,Great product,This product was great for what I needed it for. Does exactly what it says it will do.
1,Another Junk Soney Radio,"I bought this Sony radio for use in my garage. It worked about 9 months and the CD changer locked up and would trip it's internal breaker. I sent it back to Sony (at my expense) and they ""fixed"" it.It stayed ""fixed"" for about 6 months and then broke again exactly the same way as the first time.I sent Sony a letter (snail mail) describing my problem. Sony did not even reply.I was a very loyal Sony consumer. Practically every electronic device in my home is Sony (TV's, VCR's, Saletlite Dish, Cameras......you name it). I got such lousy service from Sony with this product, that I doubt I will ever buy another thing from Sony.Pass it up, it's junk."
2,Doesn't Last More Than 2 Years!,"I bought this system because it looked nice compared to spaceship looking other systems in the store that I did not want. And thinking it was from SONY it must be good quality. But just like I see other reviewers say, my system stopped working after 2 years. The power just goes down and the front light flashes, which according to the manual means you have to send it in for repairs.Never buy any SONY shelf systems. This was the 3rd one that failed in less than 3 years of use"
4,Nephew loved it!,"We got this for my nephew and he loved it. It was dealing with the Spiderman theme, so to him, it was great!"
4,Authentic Medieval Book of Hours,"If you are interested in early English texts or medieval liturgy and spirituality, this is a valuable book to own. I'm very pleased with it. My only complaint is that it is a very stripped down book of hours. It would have been more desirable if more prayers had been added."
4,A necessary volume on the topic of hell whatever one's view.,"I have not studied Fudge in depth, but I used his work in a paper I wrote on hell. This book is one of the best refutations of the traditional doctrine of hell as eternal torment. It is a positive presentation of the biblical teaching that eternal life comes only through Christ and that the unrepentant shall be eternally deprived of life by God. We can thank Fudge for all the hard work he put into this volume and it is surely a joy to see an Evangelical who takes the Bible seriously to come to such a conclusion. May God use this detailed exposition of such a difficult subject to help more people see the beauty of Christianity even when it speaks of God's judgment."
4,Good music!,I like Steve Azar's music. This is a good CD. I like most of the songs. Easy listening music.
2,Very Frustrating,"Such an intelligent writer, but one who takes 309 pages to tell a story that could have been told in less than 100. If you're into page after page of ruminating, intellectualizing, ego-centric analyzing, you'll love this book. If you prefer a good story where the plot actually moves, then look elsewhere. Maybe I just don't get the whole New York angst thing..."
5,quick shipping!,"I ordered this as a last minute mother's day gift. I chose the cheapest shipping rate, knowing that it would probably not arrive on time. Yet somehow, it arrived BEFORE Mother's Day! My mom was thrilled and said that the roses were just about to bloom upon arrival. When they did she said the plant was beautiful."
1,Need more information,I would like to know if this particular 6 pack of video's includes Vietnam. I have a 3 pack of WWII video's that are outstanding. I am particularly interested in Sammy Davis MOH back in the 60's.
2,"Underwhelming photos, but with zen-like virtues.","There is something sweet and quaint about this book. The photos are nice enough and it's appealing to think of all of the wildlife in one tiny little area. But, in the end, the book amounts to a few snapshots of racoons, foxes, and macaques.The one thing which redeems the book is its zen-like quality. Rather than overwhelm you with staggering wildlife photos taken from a huge area, this book is modest, patient, and quiet. This is not a ""greatest hits"" wildlife book, with close-ups of lion's teeth or with eagles snatching trout from a river. It's the humble undertaking of one photographer in one small locale. It is a local and plain undertaking, but one which evokes nature in its more everyday moments.Still, when one considers the wealth of other nature books and animal photography available, this book pales by comparison."
5,Another winner from the Chicken Coup,"John Mackay is an award winning jazz composer and an outstanding B-3 player. The foundation of this program is the classic B-3 organ/guitar/drums trio, with guests on several tracks playing sax and flugelhorn. Everyone sounds great, the improvisations are excellent, the compositions are strong, intonation and recorded sound are both fine throughout. This is a solid, jazzy funky organ trio effort carrying forward the legacy of Jimmy Smith and Groove Holmes. Chicken Coup was started by Tony Monaco, I believe, and offers B-3 jazz. If you have not sampled any of the Chicken Coup offerings, you owe it to yourself to try an example, ans this is a good place to start. If you enjoy B-3 jazz in this tradition, I expect you will enjoy this as I did. Highly recommended!"
2,The Great Glen Way 3rd Edition,Not what I was expecting. Very general. All info in book was a copy of what is available on the Great Glen Web site. The map would have been much more useful with detailed info of facilities available in each town. Also distance between all towns marked on map. Disappointed in content.
1,Not Worth Carrying,If you want to talk someone into going on a long distance footpath with you this book might help; if you want details on the actual trail this book will not help. Mileage information is limited. Elevation/grade information is nearly nonexistent. Good thing the trail is well marked because the map doesn't have the details needed for navigation should you manage to get lost. Certainly not worth carrying with you on the trail.
5,"Everything I Wanted to Know, and More","The Hughes flying boat, popularly known as the Spruce Goose, has been shrouded in mystery for decades before finally going on public display. This video has LOTS of information, including original footage of the only flight, from inside the cockpit and outside, construction details, and footage of Howard Hughes himself.. The story is very thoroughly presented, right up to the the most recent move to the museum in Oregon. With all the video, and a very extensive gallery of stills, this DVD may well contain virtually everything that exists on this unique aircraft. I'm well satisfied!"
4,Arthur and DW are a hit at my house,"My seven year old boy enjoys this CD. It has 2 basic tracks, one, you can ""play within the story,"" clicking on parts of the story and see short cause/effect/noises unfold. The ""play within the story"" is entertaining and a nice break from reading or getting frustrated. The other part to this CD is an actual read along. The read along is nice because as each word is read by a computer voice, it is highlighted. The reading level is simple and read at a slower pace for learning kids. I'm very happy with this CD and think it's a great beginner reader CD or struggling reader CD. I'd buy it again."
4,Arthur RR is good buy for <$4 including shipping,Good product but only have one game to play. So far my 5 yr old has used about 4hrs of play and i believe that he will play maybe 4 more hours before getting tired of repititious content. It is none the less a good program and it makes kids want to read more. Overall I am satisfied with the purchase.
2,Let's learn how to be rude,"My daughter age 6-1/2 loves Arthur. She very much enjoys this CD. I am not sure how much educational value it has, but I do know that from this CD she is learning how to be a sass mouth and rude to other family members. I think I will manage to loose the CD today while she is at school."
2,Former watch owner,The watch was not working so I mailed it back. I have been waiting for two months to be credited on my credit card or at least have someone contact me. It's been disapointing.
4,Not particularly well put together,"This is a grab bag of Carter material, consisting of same late-era recordings by the original trio; a 1960s reunion of Sara and Maybelle; and 1960s and early 1970s recordings by the reconstituted Carter Family (Maybelle, June, Helen and Anita, sometimes d/b/a the Carter Sisters). The songs are mixed together, with no regard for sequencing or thematic organization. There's also no rhyme or reason for Rosanne Cash's picture appearing on the cover -- she's not a Carter, and she doesn't appear on the record. Somewhat surprisingly, what makes this one worth the price of admission are seven the late-era Carter Family/Sisters cuts. There are plenty of CD featuring the legendary recordings of the original Carters. But, the latter-day group, featuring Anita's wonderful lead vocals and Helen's adept harmonies, is otherwise unrepresented on U.S.-issued CD product."
5,Insight plus clarity,"There are lots of clever books about Lacan, but often they are too clever for their own good (or the reader's good), simply compounding Lacan's own obscurity. This is not an easy book but you can't fault it for any lack of clarity. Unlike many Lacanians, she actually gives examples for her abstract claims, since she is not afraid to test the abstract on the concrete. Her analysis of 'Dangerous Liaisons' is brilliantly incisive. What Zizek says about her unquestionable value in the book's blurb and the preface turns out to be a fact. Great book! Don't miss it."
2,Eh!,"All right, not great. Doesn't taste bad but doesn't taste any better than tap water either. Not worth the price of the shipping which is four times as much as the product itself."
3,ok...ok...its just ok....,i liked the game a bit. buuutt it doesn't have that great graphics which is really important to me. have a nice day. therefore i say its ok....ok....its just ok...
5,"Even the youngest ""reader"" understands the humor","Examining our collection for books my children have outgrown, I came across Elephant Buttons. I just can't give this one up. There are no words in the book, but the pictures tell a cute story that even a baby can understand. The first guffaw I remember my youngest emitting was in response to this book's punchline. A real gem."
3,Not as good as the others,"While this book is enjoyable, too many of the clues are esoteric. The more recent New York Times Sunday puzzle books are much better than this one."
3,Okay,my kiddos did not stay interested in this show on the first episode but we hope to try it again some time soon
2,Poor.,1. Purchased this book based on recommendations from various woodworking blogs. This book is very poorly written.2. The overview of tools is 'paper thin' (no pun intended). I would not recommend this book to any woodwork begining or otherwise. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
2,Misprinted book,"Overall, I would rate the book very highly, but the copy that I purchased from a vendor in California was improperly bound; pages 144 through 160 were replaced with a second copy of pages 129 thru 144. I e-mailed the publisher, Lark Books, and as yet have recieved no reply. So much for customer service! If I could find an address, I would e-mail the author directly. Impressive book, would be better from a different publisher that new how page numbers were supposed to operate or cared about their customers."
1,Be careful!,When I spotted this as an accessory to the Bushnell Binoculars I bought the picture is misleading so you think that the mount and the tripod come together as a package. That is not the case. Now I have to order a tripod. They could have done a better job at letting you know that for $50 you only get the mount and not the tripod (which by the way goes for $15-$23 - thats what led me to believe the mount and the tripod came together). Bad job Amazon.
4,Solid game,"Nexus Ops is a little Risk-like though not as epic as Risk can sometimes be. The small board and funky looking pieces make things happen right away. Every time you lose a battle, you get a card with a special ability. This is a fun way to keep one player from dominating too quickly.Amanda Hamm, author ofZero Station: A Science Fiction Novella"
5,Steroids are Great,I just want to let anyone considering buying a reference book about steroids know that this is the one. It is very informative on any issue that may cocern you regaring anabolic steroids. Steroids are good when you want to knock people out!
4,"Finally, an updated anabolics book","I got it fedex today. It is a good book. I think it is better than world anabolic reveiw because it has more pictures and they are updated pictures. Alot of companies have changed labels and names since 1996. We all know how Brovel and Tornel seem to change their boxes and bottles from blue flip top to whatever. It has updated information, and more drug profiles. A definite must have for any serious bodybuilder."
2,Disappointed,"I paid $49 US for this book and was very disappointed. I also have World anabolic review 1996 and this book is far better. Anabolics 2000 has a few newer drugs but I have found this information on the internet, so the book has been no help to me. If you have no book on steriods then wait for the price to drop before paying $49 it's not worth it."
2,The Basics,"It was as if this book was a copy of the World Anabolic Review, but a lot more basic. Anabolic Review is far superior, thats just my opinion. If you want to go a step further ""Physical Enhancement with an edge"" is the Best Steroid book out there (bar-none)!!!!!!!!!"
3,Absolutely not worth $... to the semi-knowledgeable person,"Listen to what I'm saying: If you dont know jack aboutsteriods, then yes, perhaps this book is worth $... It has a decent amount of information that would be very helpful to the beginner. Also, which I found helpful were the detailed comparisions that are made between 'real' steriods and their counterfiet counterparts. BUT, if you're experienced like me and you're looking for a book that has seriously good info on anabolics that you've never read before, then this aint for you. Most of the material in this book I was already familiar with, which will also be the case for most 'experienced' users."
5,Everything you ever needed to know!!,"I had second thoughts after reading some of the reviews here, but I was very happy with the book. There are a ton of great pictures and new info. I don't know what book these other guys read but if you want STRICT in your face steroid info then the anabolics 2000 book is great!"
5,The Best,"The Modern Jewish Girl's Guide to Guilt is one of the best books I have read this year. Some of the essays had me crying with laughter and some had me crying because of the way some women Jewish women view their Jewish identity. Our book group felt stongly enough about the issues raised in this book, that we chose to hire Ruth Ellenson as a speaker for a Women's Event where 400 women came to hear her speak. Ruth got up and spoke about the essays in her book without any written material-speaking from the heart. This is a book I will certainly read again."
2,"Spots of Good Writing, But Poorly Characterized","When I picked up this book from the library for my book group, I immediately cringed at the cover. It had ""that look"" that told me I was not going to enjoy it, and for the most part, my instincts were right on. The story is of a blissful Midwestern couple with two kids who face the troubling decision of whether or not to have a third child when the wife becomes pregnant. The idea of a woman in her 30s facing an abortion is a potentially interesting issue. Unfortunately the husband and wife are very poorly characterized: she is an annoyingly narcissistic woman, and he is annoyingly gentle and understanding man. There are many interesting and well written scenes littering the book, but none of the potential of these moments is ever realized. The ending is particularly unsatisfying. In fact, the whole book feels like a cobbled together pastiche of short stories, short story ideas, scenes and characters all poorly tied together."
3,a little empty,"Cara and Douglas are the parents of two sons, Georgie and Max. And that's enough for them. Sudenly fertile Cara realises she is pregnant again, and although she doesn't want another baby, or another pregnancy, she finds herself falling in love with the baby inside her.So, they face the dilemna, have the baby and change their future, or terminate the baby and live with the grief. There is a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, etc without going anywhere much at all.Eventually they make their decision, but there doesn't seem to be many consequences. Life just goes on.I believe that termination is an individual choice, but it did make me wonder, should ""change of lifestyle"" be a valid reason?"
5,wondefully style,I read croatian edition of this book. It is big surprise for me. Wonderfull style. I hope i will read new titles of Abby Frucht on croatian. Cara and Douglas are great caracters.
2,Limited Insight on the Subject,"While the editing and filler video are aesthetically suitable, the content remains superficial. As one of the other reviewers pointed out, the narrator tells us Steinbeck was accused of being a Communist, but fails to answer whether he was or not. Did he think society's problems could be adddressed by more government? Where has that EVER worked successfully? The answer is nowhere. So if that was Steinbeck's solution to the problem of unfairness and poverty, it was an unworkable one and consequently he wasn't as perceptive as the elite assume.It's rather fascinating that the power structure fawns over bleeding hearts who are looking out for the underdog, while they're the very ones in the power positions. I was just left with too many unanswered questions from this superficial treatment of this writer."
4,Butt Set,"This item was priced nicely and functional for our technicians. In fact, it was an upgrade for the technician who needed it."
4,cool,"Very good craftsmanship, havent gotten to use it much, but it has been useful in chasing down issues with fax line connection in my office. Very happy to have this tool"
3,Good BUT,I use this set everyday for my daily service calls but all of a sudden the ringer stays on when I hook to line voltage. Too lazy to send back for repairs but otherwise sturdy and works like a champ. Maybe someone can tell me a fix?
3,There is Indeed Power in the Blood of Jesus,"While I am always excited about the Blood of Jesus, I think this book could use an updated edition as Black people have not been universally referred to as ""Negroes"" in quite some time."
1,book review for One Man's Love Story,"This book presents itself as a near death experience memoir, butin fact is merely an autobiography of a young man's life as it was before,and after, a bad car accident. The author didn't write about having anear death experience in the sense of crossing over to other realms,meeting a spiritual being, having a life review, etc.The book has a self published feel to it, and is like a young person'sdiary of daily events written over a period of several years.it is not very interesting, and is poorly written."
5,A Very Realistic Love Story,"I purchased this book as a result of sitting next to Jason on a flight form Ontario to Vegas as he continues his experiences and hopefully will someday write a continuation. Although not an avid reader, this book kept my interest and amazed my wife to see my attention span to it. An hour long encounter on a plane flight gave me an insite into a very interesting person. By reading this book you also will be able to probably relate in some way to this reveiling character."
1,Sothys Disappointes,I really don't feel that my skin benefited at all from use of this cream. I brought it because I read a magazine article that praised the product. I have received better results from masks that cost three bucks.
1,an oops.,"Major problem was that although the product was labeled ""On Going Flame, the product inside was ""very Cherry"", not what I wanted or needed. Second problem was no info on how to return it or what to do. Third problem..it took them two weeks to ship a tube of lipstick!? I was going out of town, so I just gave up. Won't buy there again."
5,great little book,"This is a great little book of recipes. I go to this all the time when I making a lotion or some type of beauty product. Rosemary is so great, all of her books are the best."
4,Herbs for Natural Beauty,Not knowing what all of the ingredients are in products you buy from off the shelf... it's nice to be able to pickup a book and do it yourself... You know just what it's made of :)
5,Espionage History 101,"If you are looking for a photographic catalog of all the gadgets and gizmos spies have used in their never ending quest for information, then this is the book for you. The pictures are great, as are the case studies of how these items were used in the ""Great Game"". I honestly am still amazed at how inventive agents and agencies were (and stil are) at coming up with fully functional devices that look like everyday items. While this is extremely heavy on WWII and Cold War era items and personalities, its still a great book."
3,Very good collection of photos,This is a straightforward collection of techniques. Very well assembled and doesn't appear to miss much. It will certainly cause a mild interest in equipment and methods to become greatly enhanced.
3,Poor Quality Web Belt,"This web belt is a fun addition to my belts, but the quality is much lower than most other web belts that I own. The belt feels more like plastic than cloth. However, the buckle is standard quality and the belt works just fine."
1,I would give that a zero star if I could,"Among all the terrible accounting textbooks known to students, this one tops it all. Advanced accounting is a hard subject and that's why it's more important to have a good text to aid students going through the subject. This text will make the learning process even harder for students, thanks for its bad English, badly organized style, bad examples, tediously long wordings, and outdated data and accounting principles. I remember the professor who taught the course told us : whoever actually finished reading this deserves a metal."
1,Doesn't work at all,"I am afraid that the microscope does not work at all no matter how you twist and turn it, it is turely a childs toy and shouldn't actually be purchased for any actual experiment. I only wish I had opened up my kit sooner so I could have returned it."
3,pretty nice,this microscope is pretty nice. I can look at many specimens and the dyes used are also there. I can't figure out how to use the projector though. I'd appreciate directions. Thanks.
1,This fan is junk!,"Dont buy this fan unless you want to flush your money down the drain.I just buoght this piece of junk,the 2 piece stand pole plastic broke when puting it together.The back screen plastic nut striped out when tightening it up snug,and it was missing the plastic fan nut.Also the motor or head part wouldnt stay up it kept droping down,what a piece of garbage!"
1,This fan is being returned!,"The angle positions on the fan head are not stable.1. If you have the fan angled straight forward, it will move itself to the upward angle from the motion of the fan once it starts to oscillate. It will NOT stay at the lowest angle.2. In order to change the speed on the fan, you have to first push down on the knob, then turn. The pressure from pushing on the knob shifts the angle of the fan head to the highest position."
1,"crap, wont work on 2001 passat","I tried them on my 2001 passat wagon and they didnt even budge the radio. I bent the keys because they r very flimzy. Then I just used a flat head screw driver and basically ripped the radio out, luckily the radio was broken thats y I was removing it. I just ripped the plastic face off the radio and used the screw driver to bend the metal tabs that hold the radio into place by bending out and catching the sides of the dash. The keys are supposed to press the metal tabs inward towards the radio so that u can pull the radio out and the tabs wont catch the sides of the dash anymore but the keys did not do that so please dont buy them they r a waste of money. If u need to keep ur radio in good working condition and dont want to rip it apart to get it out, then spent a little more money and get a better set of removal keys its worth it."
3,"Work, but not great","They work, but just barely. I used them to remove the radio on my sister's 04' jetta. They seemed to take a lot of pressure to pop in, not sure if that was the car or the tools. They dug into my hands quite a bit and I ended up bending one, but was able to bend it back.For being 2 stamped pieces of cheap steel, we are all being ripped off a little bit. But they are the only way to take a radio out of most European cars, so for that they get 3 stars. If you plan on using them more than once or twice, I'd get some nicer ones."
1,JUNK!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,These keys are junk!!! I tried to use them to remove my double din Monsoon factory head unit (2002 VW Jetta). The slightest movement up or down will cause these keys to bend. Also if you push too hard they will bend. After pulling the dash apart and discovering there is no other way to get to the headunit I pryed the front of the head unit off and bend the spring loade tabs to the inside of the headunit to finally get it out(3 hours later). Junk! Do not buy! Make sure they are thick metal. The little notch in the junk keys wore out from putting them in and out only a few times. This is required to deactivate the spring loaded tabs inside. Do yourself a favor and do not buy these!
1,what a bunch of garbage,what a bunch of garbage this product was complete garbage and does not work. i tried pullinjg the radio out of my 2005 vw passat haa after 20min of bending and cracking the keys i gave up and used a torque bit screwdriver and took off the radio panel will never spend money on these garbage tools again.
3,Pretty good,"This product is cheaply made, but it gets the job done. Barely. I'm not sure if it was my radio or the tools, but it took a lot of force to insert the tools into the slots. In fact, I bent the handles on the tools because I had to push so hard. I did eventually get them in and get my radio out. Also, to those wondering why the tools are sold in pairs instead of sets of four, many cars (the new VW Bug, for example) only have two slots, so selling a set of four would be wasteful."
2,Not the best,"These simple tools for extracting a radio from a VW New Beetle ar poorly made.They bend easily and the notches do not line up with the radio clips.If you know anything about mechanics you can cut new notches and then and only then will they work.I don't recommend these,buy better one's."
3,Flimsy but Functional,"I ordered 2 sets of these (4 total tools) to remove a RNS-E radio from my A4. The tools were flimsy to handle and could easily be bent under pressure. I had a little difficulty getting them to engage the radio's release, but they eventually worked. I got the radio out within 5-10 minutes of trying. So all in all, these tools worked perfectly.Stars deducted for bending so easily and for difficulty engaging the release. Otherwise, great product."
4,Work Fine,"Originally, I was somewhat skeptical ordering these given some of the other posters issue with these keys. These tools work fine to release and pull out a stock radio, given they are the correct keys for your car/radio. The first time I used them they worked perfectly, although a little tough to pull out. The second time they also worked fine but one did get stuck. I got it out pretty easily though with a light tap with a flat head screwdriver from the side of the radio to release it.In all honesty, if you canno't properly use these keys to get your stereo in and out (and troubleshoot any minor issues these keys give you) then you probably have no business pulling your stereo. This is the most simple part of any car audio process you may be looking to do yourself."
5,Perfect Fit,A have a '98 Mercedes E320 with the factory radio and these tools removed the stereo in seconds. Exactly what I needed. No trouble (or bending) as others stated. Put the tools in the slots (even labeled on the tools which side) and pulled out with ease.
1,Beware,Don't buy these tools. Cheap and they bend not to mention they aren't pressed to high enough tolerance to actually clip into the radio and pull it out. Garbage
4,Gets the job done,"These radio removal tools did what they are intended to do, so I would recommend them. I used them to remove the radio in a 2000 beetle. They bend rather easily, but they work as intended."
4,Striking A Chord,"'Recreating Eden' is a joy to read! Beautifully written, it is a must for anyone who is on the 'spiritual path'. Julia's own story will strike a chord for those who have had fleeting glimpses of a world 'beyond the veil'.Lovely book, Julia. Loved it. Thank you.Imelda Duffy, (Esme Conway), Author 'Into Angels', A spiritual journey for people who like to be entertained!"
3,"Nice, but sizing off",Used it on a trip to BWCAW in October in about 40 degree weather. Kept me warm and comfy. Quick drying. Only reason it didn't receive more stars was because the sizing was a little funky.
3,The trainer seems good and I like the video overall,However this is not for overweight people who need to lose a lot of weight. There aren't enough modifications for out of shape people. I would have liked to seen that.
2,SACRIFICE,This DVD started hesitating 3/4 the way through the movie; blanking out as if the recorder was attempting to jam two disk onto one disk. The end of the movie finally was shown.
1,plastic is too slippery,"Look again at the picture of the palm. The shiny material on the palm and fingers turned out to be very slippery. I wanted to use these as motorcycle gloves, but they are too slick. Excessive force is required to prevent throttle slipping. I can't imagine any application where friction is not important. Tossed these in the trash because shipping back is not worth my cost."
1,pure junk,PURCHASED TWO PAIRS . IN MY OPINION GLOVES ARE NOT WATERPROOF AND ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR COLD WEATEHR USE INVOLVING WATER. IRON CLAD USE A THIN PLASTIC TYPE MINBRAIN THAT WEARS OUT AND RENDERS THE GLOVE USELESS IN WATER. THE LINER WILL DISLODGE FROM THE FINGER AND THUMB PORTS CAUSING PROBLEMS WHEN YOU INSERT YOUR HAND. OVER RATED AND POOR QUALITY OF CONSTRUCTION..
1,this product sucks...,"for one, it is not the same glove as in the picture, it is the older version of the glove and two they arent waterproof. i used them during a decent rain and the gloves leaked after about an hour of working outdoors"
2,good idea but poor quality,"The gloves may look rugged and probably work fine for a standard work glove, but the waterproof membrane leaked right away and the lining inside ripped easily. Ok for the price as work gloves, but do not rely on them to keep water out."
2,Ironclad Waterproof disappointment,"I purchased these gloves because my job requires that I work outside in wet conditions fairly often. I had hoped they would work as advertised because it is difficult to work when your hands are cold and wet. The first time I wore the gloves we had a wet miserable day. For about an hour I thought these gloves are doing great. Then the continuous rain started seeping through and my nice dry hands were just as wet as if I didn't have the gloves at all. The positive is that they are a fairly good pair of work gloves but not for warmth or waterproof. As work gloves, they work well for general purpose but not if you need to pick up small items like bolts or nuts."
2,Not Tough Mudder approved,"These gloves might be fine for some things, but I did not find them water proof and they filled with water and got heavy and soggy. Once wet, if removed, they were impossible to get on again. Too thick for what I wanted."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THESE GLOVES,"They are being mislabeled as a smaller size then they actually are! I ordered a large having owned the exact pair once before. The cardboard the gloves are packaged to are marked with a L for large however the sticking inside the glove are clearly an XL. Not sure if they are trying to dump extra product, but buyer beware! Gloves are excellent but best purchasing directly from Ironclad."
1,Sponges,"I bought this glove thinking it would be waterproof, 'as labeled'. They are not Waterproof, in fact, they absorbed water more like sponges. While fishing my hands were continually cold and wet. Furthermore, sizes run small. What was originally a snug fit became darn near impossible to get on when wet. Buy at least 1 size larger & do not buy at all if a warm waterproof glove is needed."
2,XL = small,I didn't get a chance to try this glove because I couldn't get it on my hand. I then bought a size XXL from a different manufacturer. They aren't much bigger.
2,Ironclad Cold Condition Waterproof Glove review,"I had to return the gloves because they were much to small, even as an XL. I checked the other gloves my dad has that are the fitted type, and they were XL. He could not get his hand in these. I can not give an opinion on how they work because he was unable to ever use them. They appear to be sized smaller than most gloves in this category, which appears to be a general trait of the Ironclad brand. They do make a good product, but I think the sizing is a key item which they need to address. I returned them for a larger size of a different brand which worked some better. This brand is definitely not something I will order again over the internet unless there is previous experience with a particular model."
5,"Awesome tent, great price","Wow, when I bought this tent in mid-July it was only $51.58 with free shipping. I'm so glad I didn't go with a cheapey tent. Interesting design. Very roomy for two people plus gear. I'm sure we can squeeze in three if necessary. Have not tested in the rain yet. Good ventilation options and the rain fly gives you a little awning at the front entrance of the tent. Easy to set up-- my boyfriend did it without any help from me, as I was building the fire."
4,really good,after i test the tend is confortable easy to set up I'm happy with it we are family that enjoy outdoor life I think that I pay good price for a good tend. Columbia Hawk Ridge 10- by 7-Foot Three-Person Dome TentM'Caceres
3,Wrong product description,"The product description section contains the description of the company and how it is founded. I would have agreed about this irrelevant description of it would have been a third party seller. However, its sold and shipped by Amazon. So amazon should correct this."
4,Awesome tent for the price,"We took this tent to Yosemite for its first adventure. It sprinkled while we were there and we stayed dry. The rain fly provides great extra storage space too. The tent easily held a full-size air mattress and a little gear. It is a little tricky to set up the first time (several poles and two people needed), but setting up the second time is a lot easier. It came with a cup holder and several storage compartments which came in handy. I would highly recommend getting better stakes though...and also when you're putting on the rain fly be sure to get it lined up correctly otherwise the stakes don't go in quite right. The other really cool thing...the zippers glow in the dark! :-)"
3,Gerber Diesel,"I like the way Gerber sliding in the head of pliers rather than folding its handles just like other multitools, but poorly found out less practical of the design when the multipliers in folded state, then we want to open knife, saw or other tools we have to retract out the plier head, opening the handles out all the way, really a long steps."
5,Nothing like it. Super review,This is an internal medicine board review that uses ONLY MEMORY AIDS and it's incredibly thorough. I got at least 20 points on IM Boards just from this book. I'd like to recommend it for sure.
5,Great Memory Bookd,"I'm still using this, to prepare for my boards, but it has been a great tool for memorizing a lot of things!"
4,Relaxing,I was about to get married when I bought this. I think it helped me a lot as everybody on my D-day said that I was the most relaxed looking bride they have ever seen. It is not easy to meditate but when I want to escape from a stressful situation I just empty my mind. I liked using this DVD in the morning or in the evening.
5,perfect lunch hour DVD,I keep the DVD at work. I close the door at lunch and plug the DVD in. I do not have to think about what exercise i am going to do next. Her voice is relaxing and de-stressing. Helps my day immensely. Most of the sequences are one half hour or less so it leaves me time to eat lunch too.
4,Good for conditions other than stress,This yoga is also good for folks with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue (immune dysfunction) syndrome. Yoga is meant to be done at one's own pace and this DVD makes it easy for people who need a slower pace. The special sections concentrate on different areas of the body.The contribution by the Dalai Lama was wonderful.
2,I don't get it,"Based on these glowing reviews, I was expecting a fantastic program. My first minor complaint is the voiceover narration. I can understand why yoga instructors choose this format, but I guess I'm partial to live instruction. Perhaps I would have found the voiceover narration more tolerable had this dvd been setup differently. A mix-n-match option sounds like a potentially great idea, but the routines on this dvd are choppy and repetitive. My biggest complaint is the constant use of props. I bought this dvd to relax and relieve stress. I did not buy this dvd to fold towels in thirds.. place pillows here and there.. etc...This is a hugely overrated title, in my opinion."
5,Awesome!,"I am a beginner yoga person and this DVD is awesome. I am usually not able to relieve stress easily but this video is amazing. The ocean waves in the background and the instructors soothing voice, and good explanation of how to do the moves. I am addicted to this video. It's so wonderful! It has really helped my neck pain. I've had neck issues for a while and this virtually cured them! I have tried other DVD's and if you're looking for relaxation, this is THE ONE!"
5,Very Good,"Another good DVD by Barabra which focuses on particular stress related issues, with some general relaxation sessions.Beginning and Ending Your Day - 5 routines to start/end your dayNeck, Shoulder, and Back Issues - 5 routines focusing on stress in theose areas, including a very good routine for headaches.Easing Your Mind - 5 general relaxing sessions.Stomach and Digestion Issues - 4 routines to work on digestion.If you have AM/PM by her, the routines are different here and just as enjoyable and work as a good addition. The other sections are invaluable for the times you need what they offer with the Beginning/Ending Day sections and Easing Your Mind good for general use also."
5,Best stress relief video I have found.,"If you are looking to relax this is the yoga video for you! No strenous positions, but several different from the main stream yoga videos I have seen. It is now on my wish list."
4,Enjoy it!,"This is my first yoga DVD and first time doing yoga. Some parts were a little challenging for me, but still enjoying it. Its very relaxing and easy to follow the instructions."
5,This is medicine,"At first when I took a look at this dvd, I thought it was meant for seniors with lots of slow movements. Then one day my shoulder and neck started to hurt as usual after hours in front of my monitor, I thought to give it a try, to my great surprise, it was hard to hold the poses, the longer, the harder, after 35 minutes for this session, my pain disappeared. The instructor's voice is soothing and clear, she has the insight of our body. The video is made with high quality. It was shot in a beautiful island whose scenery is quite inspiring. The 30 min bonus with Dalai Lama is a bluff, although it does not hurt because the menu is well designed for choosing which one to play."
5,Love it!,"This video has been a life saver. I love the yoga segments, and how easy it is to target what you feel like working on. I am recommending this tape to my sisters and friends."
5,Excellent Workout; Not Hype,"Excellent Yoga DVD; the 5-star reviews are quite accurate. It contains a large variety of routines, and all of them that I've tried were excellent."
5,Great yoga video,This Yoga video is great for relaxation. It moves at a slow pace and helps you to relax completely while getting a small amount of exercise. Great video if you're looking for a way to wind down at the end of a hectic day.
3,"Easy to follow, beautiful background.","The DVD is very well made and easy to follow, but I felt it was not as relaxing as some other yoga videos I have done. It actually made my a little jittery, because I have a hard time relaxing. I prefer a video that starts out slow, works into a harder workout, and then slowly goes back to slower and relaxing. But, I would think it would work for some people."
4,Beautiful video,"I found this video to be very well done. The setting was beautiful and the overall mood was relaxing which is what it is advertised to be. I thought the intro of The Dalai Lama was very interesting, also."
4,Well done,"This has become my outlet for stress and I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from neck pain, back pain, insomnia, etc."
5,Relief Is Found,"I have been using Barbara's AM/PM title for quite awhile and have been enjoying, so I picked this DVD up also to help with some specific issues I find myself having from time to time and being able to focus on these things has been very helpful. Nice easy poses that are effective."
2,Good choreography but not effective for me,"Bought this based on the number of positive reviews. It's definitely well made and the settings are relaxing. As much as I respect the Dalai lama, I did not get all the advice on meditation, despite increasing the volume and rewinding for the bits I missed. Poor audio quality combined with dialect problems. I bought this DVD because I have IBS and a hormone imbalance with gives me backaches and really stiff muscles. Holding the lying down poses made the aches worse. I was looking for gentle yoga with flowing poses done at my own pace and this was not quite it. I have tried this DVD thrice(with blankets and bolsters to help my sore muscles) with no positive effects noticed. Will not be using this. Maybe chi gong or a gentle flow type yoga is more for me."
4,A little choppy,"So far it has done all the benefits that I had hoped it would...quieting my mind and easing my stress. Helping to take life a little less serious. My migraines are even lessening...so thank you!! :)The only complaint is it is a little choppy. The segments are pieced together b/c they use them in other sections of the dvd. One minute you are lying on your mat and the next she's standing up. I'm sure once I have become familiar enough with the dvd, I'll know what to expect and it won't seem so disruptive."
2,Yoga stretches only,"The backdrop and the presenter in this tape are pleasing to the eye at first; however, after a period of time, I found myself annoyed while listening and moving into the postures. The instructor kept up a steady flow of instructions; some were pertinent, but others were simply extraneous information, and it made relaxing and fully engaging in the moves distracting. Also, I was anticipating a yoga tape with moves that flowed from one into the other; this tape is a series of instructions in each segment that teaches one stretch at a time. When instruction for that one is completed, the scene fades out and an entire new movement begins. This would be a good tape for someone who wishes to just focus on individual movements or stretches."
5,Effective For Stress Issues,"This DVD is a wonderful addition to practice or learn yoga with. It is generally designed to help with certain specific physical conditions that affect you, such as headaches, and also includes other more general things to work with. Even if you do not have a physical problem, the routines such as easing tension in the shoulders work well for days when you feel tight.The items are paced well and Barbara carefully leads you through things. Very calm and soothing and her outlook on yoga and stress is a good one to learn from. I am still relatively new to yoga, and this really can be done by anyone.It has things for energizing & relaxing from the day, neck/back/shoulders, general mental relaxtion and stomach issues.Very nice"
5,This is the best relief I've found for stress and headaches and every thing else that accompanies stress.,I love the background beach and relaxing waves. I can do simple stretches or more advanced yoga and my stress goes out with the waves of the sea.
5,A devoted yoga fan,"This is one of the best yoga DVD out there. I would highly recommend this one to anyone, the beginner or an advanced level. You can pick and choose your sessions and I love the chapters dedicated to various issues of the body. All the poses are very easy to follow and makes you forget for a moment you are in front of the TV, and not on the secluded beach somewhere..."
2,Nice exercises but the DVD barely plays,This DVD worked for one session and then promptly started freezing and it basically not usable now. It won't play in any machine.
3,Disappointment,"The program is fragmented and there is no flow to it, which greatly detracts from its effectiveness. I was very disappointed in how the video had individually filmed segments."
3,Not for beginners,"Not good for beginners unless you're already very flexible. Found the Dalai Lama portion boring, it just went on and on."
5,Yoda for Stress Relief w/the Dalai Lama,I purchased this CD for myself. It's a great stress reliever. Very easy going instruction. I definitely recommend this to anyone who does yoga...the beginner to the experienced.
2,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews I was looking forward to this yoga dvd but was very disappointed. It seems like every segment whether for back,stomach,relaxation,etc, were all the same. It honestly doesn't involve all that many yoga poses. It involves more laying and meditating than any yoga dvd I have tried so far. And it requires such things as 3 blankets, chairs, walls, etc.. So if you are looking to learn meditation this is good but if you are looking to learn yoga I'd buy beginners yoga by Yogaworks instead."
3,An average yoga video,I found it just average. Nothing new or speciall except for the view of the ocean.
2,Not for me,"I bought this based on the great reviews, but I got to say it is quite disappointing. I bought this to unwind, but I find the voice-over narration really distracting. I can understand some coaching, but she never stops talking. She talks continuously, not quite sure why they even bothered with some music and the sounds from the ocean..you can't really relax and enjoy those sounds. Probably would have been an excellent DVD had the voice-over, loud, constant talking not completely ruined it for me. I also didn't like the way the sets are broken up into segments. Yoga should be flowing. Lastly, routines are repeated under different categories...there are enough yoga poses to have uniqueness within each category. Definitely not for me."
2,gotta wonder why its so cheap!,an hour of Dalai Lama and trainer talking! couldnt stand it I had to turn it off! buy something else if your looking exercise video.
2,Extremely slow,"This dvd was too slow for me and not what I thought I was purchasing. I needed a more challenging yoga workout that also had a ""cool down""...this was not in this dvd. :("
3,It was ok but too short.,"My mom and I enjoyed this. It was something she could do with me but way too short. The information was helpful, but would like more relaxing/destressing yoga. :)"
3,"Relieves stress, but doesn't do much else.","Although this yoga DVD does offer a number of good routines for stress relief, the routines are not even remotely challenging. I will be honest that I have not tried every routine yet; this is because the first few that I tried consisted mostly of lying on your back on the mat... which I did not find very exerting. I was disappointed by this, so I have not used it as much as I might have otherwise. To be fair, the DVD does not claim to be challenging, just that it will reduce stress, and it is effective for that. Just don't expect to get into shape because you've used this video."
2,"too slow, and a bit borig","I recommend it to the more elderly population, or if you want to meditate more than exercise...For me it was too slow and make me want to fall a sleep."
5,Marvelous Yoga DVD,"I bought this DVD because I had already tried AM PM Yoga from Benagh and really had enjoyed it. The reason I started practicing yoga with her DVDs was because I was suffering from serious lumbar spine and sciatica pain. Gradually, over the last two months the pain is subsiding and I'm able to perform my daily tasks with much less suffering. I'm forever in debth to her. The sequences are done slowing so we can enjoy the practice fully and all of them consist in very good options for the daily practice. Depending on your time available you can choose from 20 minutes to 60 minutes classes without loosing the benefits of the practice. Very nice DVD, I highly recommend it. I LOVE IT, I do it everyday."
2,not much of a DVD for a yoga enthusiast.,"Being a yoga enthusiast, I wasn't thrilled with this DVD. It was broken down into too many categories and the layout was choppy. I always look for yoga DVD's that have 2 or 3 routines instead of all these short routines. Also I found the routines to be fussy with all of the folding of the blankets. I have purchased at least 6 or 7 DVD's on Amazon and this is the first time that I was disappointed."
4,Yoga as it should be,"Yoga for Stress Relief has so many different selections! It's great if you don't have a gym membership or access to a yoga class. This is yoga as it should be, calm, relaxing, and doesn't make you wonder when it's going to be over. If you have trouble with your lower back, this dvd is perfect. If you just want something to get started in the mornings or to calm down with in the evenings, this dvd is also for you."
5,Excellant,I picked this up because I liked Barbara's other DVD alot. This one is just as good. Excellant instructor and workouts to help you relax.
2,Get the Lonely Planet book instead,The maps in this book are completely inadequate. Barcelona is a big complicated city and needs more than Powerpoint-style graphics that pass for maps. Reading a flimsy Spanish map from the tourist office was better. Pictures... virtually non-existent. Construction of book absolutely pales in comparison to a Lonely Planet book. Poor layout. I do not work for Lonely Planet!
2,Handmade with imperfections,"I do realize that all handmade items come with imperfections, but I would at least expect the lid to sit flat on the butter dish. I was replacing this exact same butter dish that broke. The first one was fine, but the replacement lid doesn't seem to match up with the replacement tray."
4,cute,i bought this for my mother in law for christmas and they looked really nice only thing is that they brake easily.
2,nova hostess set,I was disappointed when I received this hostess set as the salt & pepper shakers were just fine but the bottom of the butter dish was in many pieces and some were so small they even fell through the bottom of the box before I opened it. The wrap was not around the box but on one side so there was no cushion if the package had been thrown or dropped or whatever did happen to it.
3,Good product - poor shipping,"I ordered this product to match my dinner dishes. The product itself is fine, although I did get one that had a butter dish where the base didn't fit the lid correctly. However, the first time the package was delivered, the salt shaker was broken, and when the replacement came the butter dish was broken. I had not shipped the first set back until I received the replacement, so I was able to get all the pieces I needed, but then I got an email saying they hadn't received my return yet and if they didn't get it soon I would be charged for the replacement product. I have shipped the return, but I have not received my credit card bill; I will not be happy if I have been charged for a second set."
3,Arrived broken - twice,"First item arrived with butter dish cover broken.Replacement arrived with salt shaker broken, and with chip in butter dish cover."
3,Took a while...,"I have the Sango Nova dishware and purchased the butter dish, salt and pepper set. They came (January and cold) looked fine. As I took them out and set them on the counter, our whole family turned and stared as we heard high pitched ""pings"" coming from the butter dish. We stood and stared for about 15 minutes as we watched it continue to make a pinging sound and proceed to crack in half. It got returned. I got another set and it seems fine so far!"
3,Nice set,"It's a very nice set, I love it, except the butter dish is HUGE and the top is to oversized for the bottom, so it doesn't match well with the bottom"
5,TEBALDISSIMA,"Tebaldi at her best. She is a wonderful Tosca as always was, but now singing in a live performance. I think this is better than the one with George London in Germany. The rest of the cast is correct. It is a little funny the japanese people in the choral scenes but does not matter. We have Tebaldi singing and that is what really matters."
4,Tebaldi is breathtaking as Tosca.,"To be sure, we have so few video memories of the Golden Age of Opera, in other words when opera singers were worth a damn. But this is a purists dream come true. Tebaldi at her very peak, truly showing why she was the very best spinto soprano ever. She has the tonal beauty required of this difficult tole, along with her ringing Cs and dramatic acting. A great opera to own, I only started a year ago, and this one I have loved the most. Puccini at his finest. Truly a must have."
1,Bad sounding headphones!,"I've been a fan of Sony earbuds for many years. Due to the bad reviews of durability of the latest Sony earbuds, I decided on purchasing these Panasonic headphones. I bought these headphones because my Sony headphones died after 3 years and to upgrade my factory Creative Zen Micro headphones. I found a perfect fit between the 3 size earplugs. I've noticed that it does block out the sound in your surroundings. It's good for that commute to work when there is a lot of noise. I like the around the neck feature. As far as quality, the extention part of the wiring looks durable but not the around the neck part of it. As far as the performance of the headphones, I'm really disappointed in these headphones. My factory Creative headphones had out performed these. The bass level is too low even when I max out the bass in the player. The mids and treble sound like crap. Don't waste your money on these! Now I have to spend more money to replace these poor quality headphones! argh!"
3,This style is great; Sound OK; stuck if you loose an earpiece,"This basic style is great, with the ""soft donut"" of rubber that fits VERY comfortably in your ear, and really blocks outside sound. I've used this a lot of airplanes, trains, etc. In comparison to another brand, I had similar style in Sony's (also great noise reduction; somewhat better music) BUT on the SONY the cables gave out on two pairs (!)- it was as-if the rubber just melted off. Panny is much more durable rubber cables. Had good results with Panny HJE50 for six months til, somewhere, I lost one rubber earpiece. No replacements - you have to buy a new $20 device."
2,what's with non-adjustable length?,"the line leading to one earbud is very very short and because of it, I couldn't even put the mp3 player in my pocket and use these without an extension (which it came with). The line leading to the other earbud was way too long, so there's excess line and it's not adjustable. That alone makes it too aggravating to rate well, never mind the sound, which falls somewhere in the 'not bad, not wonderful' category."
2,Get what you pay for,"Not all that excited with these:1) the whole behind the neck setup where one cord is longer than other is just crazy. It puts too much weight on left side and earphone falls out. Makes it pretty useless for running.2) Sound is very tinny. Lots of highs, no lows. I just got them and am burning them in now, so maybe this will get better, but for now it doesn't sound all that great to me. I guess I shouldn't expect too much for the price though. I actually thought my apple ones sound better though (if that gives you any idea).I can't say I'd recommend these at all. I think in general though you either pay a lot for high end ones (shure, etymotic); or you're stuck with lots of crap at the low end. I did try some Sony funtopias and found them no better than these and they were $40 (very muddy bass), so I think you're either stuck going very high or just settle for something cheap."
3,Downside of Ear Plug Style Earbuds,"I purchased a set of these earbuds based on reading some of the reviews. I agree that they are comfortable and that they sound pretty good, but there are a couple of downside issues that were not discussed. These earbuds create a seal in the ear like ear plugs. This results in intensified sounds that are transmitted by touching the wires, walking, breathing, chewing, and etc. It also passively reduces outside noises like people trying to talk to you (not good in the office, but maybe good in an airplane). They also tend to slowly slip out of my ears and have to be frequently pushed back in (yes I've tried all three size ends). They have unequal length wires for the left and right ear, which I don't like. I usually carry my MP3 player in my shirt pocket and the right wire either dangles and twists in front or gets caught on my shirt collar. Overall, I prefer my open-air style buds or headphones."
3,Dragon Blood Oil,"After all the hype from the ""Dr. OZ"" show I ordered this, it has a nice smell, butI would say the over the counter bath oils work just as well as this does."
1,Caps Do Not Fit,The dish washer Tine caps are too large of diameter and consequently will not stay on the tines. They are a waste of money unless you have a very old dishwasher.
2,Disappointed,"While I certainly appreciate the challenge Ms. Brady had in conducting research on America's first lady, I am disappointed with the book. Ms. Brady does help the reader to understand the valuable service Martha Washington performed for her country by keeping ""George happy and healthy and in a somewhat balanced mental state"" considering the stress of conducting a war without money, training, supplies, etc. However I purchased this book based on previous reviews and after reading the book realized it lacked details that kept it from being a very valuable research book as well as an enjoyable read. I expected more of a combination of a scholarly interpretation coupled with extensive research. In my opinion it failed to do so."
1,Didn't enjoy this at all,"My high school was assigned the task of reading this book for summer reading this year. I do not know of one child in my entire school that enjoyed it. While the subject is extensively researched I found the writing extremely monotone and improvised. It seems that Brady used the word ""probably"" too much throughout the pages. I understand that Brady is trying to paint a picture of the life and tales of Martha Washington for the reader, but it doesn't really seem to be told from Martha's standpoint, more from Brady's view. All of the charecters are made out to be very jolly and like they can do no wrong. I also believe it lacked important details and that too much effort was spent on very detailed lists of things like the 2 page monologue on what food was consumed at a dinner party. It was all just really fake to me."
4,Very Readable,I thought this book was pretty well written. The author did a nice job telling the story of not only Martha but the Washington family without getting bogged down by too many details. I also learned a lot about day to day colonial life. The reason I give it 4 stars is because the author let her dislike of Thomas Jefferson show through. She mentioned that Jefferson didn't really think much of Martha but then later in the book took one paragragh and really threw Jefferson 'under the bus' so to speak. I found the paragraph out of charactor for the whole book and wondered why the editor kept it in.
5,Fascinating...,I can't say enough about this book. It was a wonderful read and great for anyone that wants to know more about Martha Washington and the life she lived. Fascinating read!
1,Needs Re-design,"This thing needs a re-design. It's using last generation LEDs which aren't very bright and are un-focused. I compared it to a minature LED flashlight with new generation LEDs and one-tenth of the battery mass.Even with the Zelco practically sitting on top of my steak, I couldn't tell how cooked it was. With the minature flashlight from 3 feet away, I could instantly see that it was still rare. I'm returning it immedidately!"
4,Richard Scarry Busy Town,"My son loves the Richard Scarry Busy Town software programs. They consist of things he is familar with and enjoys (example: building a road or using a tractor and planting a field). Each program has a difficulty level that you can set. The beginner's level has a flashing star to help your child along, so if you do not want the flashing star to assist your child then changing the difficulty level will eliminate the star."
1,Pure Drivel,"This book has no redeeming value whatsoever. The photographs look bad, the content is bad and many of the models are has-beens who never were. Overall a waste of paper pulp, although I initially picked it up because I liked the cover."
3,Very useful!! But can be hard to clean!!,"This product worked great and fit in the bath just as pictured. The only complaint I have is that we didn't have it more than 5 or 6 months and the soap scum it accumulated was crazy!! It came off with bleach, but took work, especially getting through the cracks. Maybe if you had more time to clean it, this is a good product for you. Otherwise I wouldn't bother, you will be buying something else shortly after."
4,Very Useful,"It was a little bit difficult ""sliding"" together - the pieces kept getting stuck but otherwise was a great purchase. I had been looking for one of these for a long time and it has come in very handy."
1,not so much,It was pretty flimsey. It reminds me of a cheap plastic and it smelled kinda funny. was to nice to leave there looks trashy
2,umm...,Nobody mentioned the fact that if you have a shower curtain... this won't work! This is a very sturdy and a smart idea but what a waste of money!
5,Great,I totally love this product. I previously had a net with suction cups from Avon. The bottom got YUCKY and the suction cups slipped. This is great and my 18 mth old loves to fill it up and empty it out during bath time.
3,Just okay for me,"If you have to share the bathtub/shower with your baby, the curtain won't close around this item. We only have 1 bathroom and can't use it for that reason. Would be good if the child had their own bathroom though."
4,Cheap construction but does the job perfectly!,"This is pretty cheap plastic but surprisingly sturdy. It is adjustable but tough to do in the beginning, but once you've got it to the right width, it stays at that point. Then, it just sits on the edges of your tub and can easily be moved. It's definitely not sturdy enough to have your child pull on or try to hold him/herself up with, but it is PERFECT for throwing all the toys in and letting them drip dry. It is also strong enough to hold a few shampoo/soap bottles as well. I tried a number of different toy nets and scoops that hung or suction cupped to the walls and none worked well; they either fell off the wall and collapsed into the tub or didn't really dry the toys. This dries the toys completely and that was my number one priority and that's why I'm happy with it, particularly for the very reasonable price!"
5,Love it!!,This is a great product to keep the bath toys IN the tub!! No suction cups (that never worked for me anyway)!! It rests right on the tub and keeps the shampoo/soap all right there in reach! I love it!!
2,not big enough,this falls through into the tub if bumped just slightly. i have it expanded all the way and pushed to the smallest part of the tub and it falls through. it would be very nice for keeping tub toys if it didn't fall through all the time!
3,Convenient but hard to clean,"The way it is made makes it very difficult to keep clean, the water is collecting in the bottom, instead of draining, so some mold can appear. Otherwise it is convenient and easy to assemble."
2,"Great storage, but not good for toddlers pulling up.","I was so excited about this product especially after reading all the great reviews, but we had real trouble with our daughter trying to pull up on it and tumbling over. There's no way to secure it to the tub, unfortunately- it would be great if it came with suction cups or something to attach it to the horizontal surfaces of the tub. I think this would be great for older children after they're past the pulling-up stage, but for now, we have removed it from the tub :( Hopefully we can use it later on!"
2,Not safe at all!,I have to take it out of the tub every time I give my son a bath because if he tries to push on it it moves and he will fall over. It needs to have some sort of mechanism to be able to stick in position so that is doesnt move around.
3,durable,this item was bought for me to use as a organization tool to help with sons bathtub toys..... its very durable but could come with some kind of thing to make the spacers stay in place as i have found that no matter what you do to keep them in place somehow they come out...... not sure if it was from my son pulling them out or what but it has def kept my bathtub alot cleaner
1,Poor design,"This basket is not a toy but a storage containers for bath toys. It is made of multiple parts that need to be assembled together. This design is rather flawed as it allows for accummlation of more dirt, and the pieces do not fit together well (especially if warped). I've seen those baskets made as one piece in the past, a nice sturdy design, easy to remove and clean. Very disappointed with this one."
3,needs a good ledge,"This did not stay up in our bathtub - it needed more of a ledge to be sturdy, at least an inch of flat surface, not sloped into the tub. Every time it got the least bit bumped it would fall into the tub. I realize this is due to the design of our tub, not this product, but I do feel like I wasted $12."
4,"Horrible packing, item was fine despite it all.",This was horribly packed. No outer carton and the box was all ripped and taped up. Inside the item was fine but there was also a feather duster in there? Just really weird. Would not buy from here again.
3,too much money,"I really wanted this to be worth the money, but it isn't. In it's defense, I have a garden tub, and it isn't very secure when extended all the way. One step up from 99 cent store quality. But my son likes having it in the water with him. It's just another toy now."
3,Ok.,"It's not pretty, but I have not found anywhere anything better.It does its job, and at least it fits sideways a few mermaids...."
4,nice!,so useful.. but how can i hold it on the tub?or it just stays on it..?cuz my daughter keeps moving it so its kinda embarrasingbut still nice and so useful.
2,hard to clean,"this is very useful for holding a lot of stuff, and to separate my toddler from hot water coming from the faucet. however, since it has stuff in it, it is a mold cesspool. it is also very hard to clean, with tiny ridges all over it. the major source of mold are the deep ridges where the two parts slide together--which was originally a selling point for me, since that's what makes it adjustable. i cleaned it twice, but both times it took at least half an hour, since nothing really works well to get into those ridges. we also don't put plastic items in the dishwasher, so that is not an option. i am now looking for a wire basket that i can stick in the dishwasher from time to time."
1,"Very poorly made,disappointed by this purchase!","I bought this bath storage basket to keep bath toys and my one yr old baby's wash stuff organized neatly as it shows in the pic.Item arrived in no time as usual,unfortunately,the product is cheaply made!We've a wider bath tub,when i stretched the organizer to fit in our tub it fell apart even before i could put stuff in it!Tried using it by putting very less and lighter items,still it cant hold more than just floating foam letters!It may work for smaller bath tubs but definitely not for wider ones.Didnt want to go thru the hassle of returning,so its just sitting with no use in the cupboard. Disappointed overall in this product."
3,Can this marriage be saved?,"I like it, my husband hates it. You have to take it out of the tub every time your child decides he'd like to lie back for a soak. Husband: this is too much work. Me: Whatever. Husband: All I'm saying is that when it's full of wet crap, and I have to take it out of the tub and it drips all over the place, I'm not cleaning it up. Me: Take it out of the tub BEFORE beginning bath. Husband: I'm going to write my own reviews."
3,ok,This was harder to get together than I had anticipated. I never did get it to slide all the way where it would fit straight on my bath tub so it is sideways and it works just fine that way I guess...considering my 2 year old just wants to sit on it.
5,greaaaaaaaaat,"this is absolutely the best toy holder i ever had. it holds everything for the kids. when the toys are done aha; shampoo, conditioner, soap, or any other necesity's for tub or shower. thank you, margaret."
5,love it!,super great product! easy to put together and easy to use. just let it drip dry overnight in shower and take it out in the morning for adult shower usage. stays against the wall until next kiddo bath. easy.
4,Very Sturdy,"This was purchased for my daughter as a Christmas present. I am very happy with the product but not happy with the way it was shipped.The basket is very sturdy and useful. It is made of thick plastic. My daughter is happy with it and I am too.The only thing I didn't like is that it was shipped without any amount of shock absorbing material around the box. I totally understand the idea behind using less shipping materials and not using a giant box for a small item, but it was only covered in a thin paper board box. When plastic becomes cold it can easily become brittle and when being shipped with a bunch of other big, heavy boxes it will undoubtedly get knocked around and break. That said, it managed to arrive without damage.I think it was worth the price, in the end."
2,mold collector,The basket and toys in it get mold very quickly and must be cleaned regulary. I will go back to using a mesh bag that suctions to the wall as I did not have to worry about mold. Overall not happy with the this product.
2,Did not work for our 12 month old,"This thing is sitting in our closet. Our child simply pulls it into the bathtub every time we try to put it up so it is rendered useless. Maybe it would be better for an older child who won't toss it into the bathtub, but for our 1 year old (now 15 months) it is useless. Maybe we'll try again in 6 months."
5,Earth in Upheaval,"I wanted to write a review for worlds in collision but it was too full! However I have read this and it is equally worthy of praise, I studied Archaeology and I have no worries with his extrapolations. What interests me is that in my studies I see time and time again that historical evidence is often accurate and that myths are often rooted in reality. Today we box everything up into history or science or art but Velikovsky combines them eloquently, Why did the scientific establishment feel so abashed by his work that they threatened his intended publishers MacMillan, that they would leave the publishing house if they put him into print?"
4,Fine for me,"I must have been moving too fast to take much notice of the errors the other reviewers mentioned. I found Arco's GMAT prep book and CD to be a very useful review and preparation for the logic and math on the GMAT.Not having time for a formal prep course I bought this book, scheduled my GMAT with the testing center, and worked quickly through the book. Having the test scheduled and my money paid was a good way to get myself moving. The book seemed clear and straightforward. There is a lot of review of the questions given in the practice tests. It helped me start to think like the test writers and look for the subtleties in the questions. It did not give me a new brain, and I was not surprised to see my final scores reflect how I have done on other standardized tests.Get the book, take the test, get back to school. You will be glad you did."
4,lupita manana,Lupita manana reviewI liked and enjoyed this book because it has interesting points and suspense in the book that makes you want to read more. Also it makes you wonder what will become of them and there future. The part that I really didn't like was the ending that left me not knowing what other problems she is going to face with (la migra). My favorite part of the book was when there are going to the U.S. and finding out if they were going to make it through there whole journey. The author makes this book realistic almost in a situation where an immigrant person with problems would be in. Another way it makes it realistic is the obstacles and challenges they go through to get to there aunts Consuelo's house. The age group that would be appropriate for is around 12 or 14 because of there visual understanding of what there going through.Ana Hernandez
3,lupita manana,"Would you like to know how a girl, and her brother from Mexico, crosses the border to the U.S.? The girl named Lupita, and her brother named Salvador, and lived with there parents. But one day the father worked as a fisherman, and a storm come, and the father's ship was destroyed. The father died. After the father death, Lupita, and Salvador went to the U.S., but the mother can't go with them, she had to work, and stay with the young brother and sister. So Lupita and Salvador cross over, and search for there aunt made them work in the field. To know more about the book, you had to read the book.This book its okay at first, but it gets interesting at the end, and I recommend this book to all the people, who had to cross to U.S.A., or who didn't. Enjoy reading."
4,Lupita Manana,"Lupita Manana by Patricia Beatty was the book I read. The book started in a small village in Mexico called Ensenada. It's about a girl name Lupita and her family after there father dies in a boat accident her mother doesn't have enough money to support their family. So Lupita and her older brother must across the border to come to California so they can work and send money to there family back home. It's hard for them because of the new language and the migra also there job doesn't pay well. The book was interesting, sad and kind of scary. The interesting part in this book is when they across the border. The parts that where sad is when Lupita's father dies and when they have to leave there family behind. The scary part is when the migra comes where they are living. I recommend this book to any one that is interested in seeing how immigrants work hard to come to the United States."
4,A story of two Brave Teenagers,"Lupta Manana is a story about a 13 yr. old girl named Lupita and her brother Salvador, 2 brave teenagers that must cross the border to make money. They have to do this beacause of the death of their father who died in a fishing-- commercial accident. Along the way many dangerous things happen. This story is sad, put a good one. It explains a lot of what immigrants go through to live in the U.S. I had to read this book for a U.S. Government class. It is a good story, I really recommend it to ages 12 and up. Grades 6 and up. It never hurts to try to read something new. ENJOY IT!"
5,lupita manana,"I think that lupita is going to America to help her mom and her siblings at México. She goes through hard times to get to the boarder and into the untied states. Also lupita and her bothers Salvador have to avoid the La Migra in the United States and where they also go. Every time the La Migra comes Lupita, and her brothers have to run and hide. They run and hide because there illegal immigrants and not a citizen of the United States. But there grandma is a citizen. She is also very rich. She lives in a big house. Also they help with the chores and picking food from the garden. Life for them is a lot harder after there father had die at sea."
2,Well....,"I had to read this book for school, and normally the books we have to read for school are ok. But it's such a negative book, and it's sympathetic towards illegal immigration. It was a bad book, I didn't like it."
4,Lupita Manana,"This book was kind of boring at first but after a while it ended up being very interesting. It really made you thinkabout the hard things immigrants have to go through to come into the U.S.I really liked this book having to have read it for a Language arts assignment, but i think the end kinda makes asudden stop. Other than that this was a very intesresting story."
1,Rayovac 3 in1LED Flashlight,"I bought two of these flashlights because Mr. Royce wrote such a raving review. I was so disappointed when they arrived and fell so far short of the mark. The white LED light is okay, although I have a smaller one which is much brighter, the red Led is just okay too. The main light which is zion (or something like that) is very yellow and not very bright. I have been interested in LED technology and so have several flashlights and candles and this one is inferior."
4,Rayovac Sportsman 3-in-1 LED Flashlight,"Its a little ""bulky"" and it would be nice to not have to cycle through all three light types when you're only looking for one; but a very cool light."
1,"Great Idea, but........",I ordered one of these from Amazon. At the time it seemed like a great deal. The flashlight arrived complete with batteries. I installed the batteries (several times) and the light just wouldn't light. It was totally dead. I tried another set of batteries with the same result.The good news is that Amazon was terrific about getting my defective item replaced. I was able to print a postage paid label for the return. Amazon even shipped the replacement flashlight before getting my broken one back.The second flashlight arrived. It was a dead as the first one.I wasn't about to go 3 strikes and out. I was pissed after 2. I sent the other broken light back for a refund. I took my refund to the grocery store and bought a small ham. I ate it in the dark...
5,Great Product - gentle/smells nice,"I bathe my doodle A LOT (weekly, usually) because she plays outside and gets mud in her fur and it's hard enough to keep her hair mat free! This shampoo makes her hair soft and easy to get tangles out. It's gentle enough that I feel good even using it on her face."
5,Adicted to This!,Dont trust my review I am a Frank Cooper addict. I just love this product and the other jams Cooper makes.It's not too sweet and and is really like a case of oranges crammed into a small jar. Very hard to find here as it is a UK product but worth it.I warn you to order several jars as you might run out and have to buy that other super market stuff!
3,Not What I Thought It Would Be,I have tasted marmalade I liked better.Thought I would give this a try because of cost.\OkBut will not order again
2,"Kinda cute, but not appropriate for a gift","This is actually a cute book with some nice photos of grandmothers and children. However, I was looking for a book that my son could give to his grandmothers as a gift, and this book is not at all appropriate for that. Many of the entries are either a little weird or simply don't apply to his grandmothers. Examples: ""I love Grandma because she steers me away from the wrong friends,"" or ""I love Grandma because she lets me jump on the bed."" If you're thinking about making your own personal version though, then this book would be good to use for ideas of what to say and what kinds of pictures to include."
3,Ok...,It's ok... It's exactly like the lightsaber toys you can find at Wal Mart or Target or any Dollar Store around Halloween... Mine hasn't broken yet and lights up fine...
2,"A prop, and nothing more","I was a little disappointed with this toy. There is a flimsy little clip that holds the saber in the handle that was broke when the toy arrived, but honestly the kids play with it just the same. Not sure what else you would expect for the price, and it looks better that all the others I've seen in the local stores."
5,ATV - A Terriffic Video (Game)!!!!,"Awesome graphics with ultra realistic crashes and wipeouts. Challenging, heart pounding excitement. Mayhem and fun all in one!!! Great for all ages."
3,OK...but it could easily be better...,"First off, there are very few ATV games out there, so this is a pioneer. However, there's not choice for the Honda 250R, which is the ultimate racer. No ability to custom modify your wheeler. Reverse shouldn't be available on the 400EX and the Banshee. Also, it was annoying that the rider fell off the wheeler way too often. Steep hill... he falls off. Land sideways... he falls off. Hit a tire while going maybe 3 mph... he falls off. It's a good game, but by no means great. Let's hope that the guys who program this game get out there and ride a little before they make ATV Fury 2. Plus, they need to put in a hill climb and some drag races."
4,Most realistic ATV experience,"If you ride ATV's for real, and know how they react to different terrain and conditions, you will really appreciate this game. The ATV's you can ride are based on real models by Kawasaki, Suzuki, Banshee, etc... The graphics are realistic and smooth, and the races are challenging. you can unlock a cool 1000 cc ATV when you beat the first set of races, and the game's soundtrack includes real songs, mostly alt rock. My only gripe with the game is there is no water or mud bogs to ride through. Aside from that, the game is great for anyone who is into off-road ATV driving."
5,gets you hooked,"This game is very addicting when I first got it it was 19.99 so I didn't think that it would be all that good of a game. When I put it in my PS2 I was addicted when I first started playing there are 19 courses, 11 atv's, colors ""red, green, yellow, purple, and blue"". There are also different styles of clothing to choose from. Then you can also do tricks while in the air, there are about 16 of them. The last thing is that you can edit the tracks to the way you want them."
3,Not a good game,"The problems with this game are sensitivity and vehicle control. If you crash it will put you last in the pack and you may never catch up. Some levels are hard to pass because of this issue. Also, you must steer and land accurately or you'll be thrown off the ATV and might lose the race.Overall, the game play is fun, but just a little difficult to control."
1,atv offroad fury......cheap AI......cheap AI.......cheap AI,"Frist off let me say the courses on this game are the best i have ever seen. Lots of jumps, houses, building and lots more of goodies.The freestyle and Cross Country Enduro are a blast to play. This game deserves a 10!!! But wait I just got done playing pro carrer the mode to unlock max atv and let me tell you the Arttifecal Intellegence is the worst i have ever seen in a racing game. The computer falls of there atv and they get on it in milla seconds. But if you dump YOUR atv 10 SECONDS!!!!!!! The computer lands on top of you you fall off. Understandable, except when you do it to them they stay on the atv. But the game does deserve a 5 just for 2 player and the other modes. it is to bad though that pro career is such a rip off. CHEAP AI!!!!!!"
3,Can be better,ATV off road fury is a fun game but only in the first month after that the game will be boaring and you won't want play it any more. so if you want to buy it just know that after a month of playing this game it will almost never be in your PS2 console(unless you got no other games).
2,Oh boring where art thou?,"Well the answer is in this game. The racing itself as a sport is nothing that makes the player happy, but this game ruins any chances for ATV racing. Its hard to turn and all the cars stink. In freestyle mode, the lamest tricks are only successful when you land it just right. The reason why I did not give it a one is because the graphics are above average and the vast freestyle levels are nice and a little more interesting than the actual racing, which will tire out after ten minutes. If you want a racing game or offroad game wait and rent something like 4X4 EVO or just buy Gran Turismo 3"
5,ATV Offroad Fury,"I purchased the ATV Offroad Fury for my 11 year old grandson and he loves it, plays it all of the time. I even like it and play it with him, he also plays it with his 3 year old brother."
2,(yawn...),"This game is just...ok. Nothing too memorable or mind-blowing. My kids seem to enjoy it a little bit more than I do, but even they get bored with it after 10 minutes or so. The graphics are good. The controls are way too sensitive; it doesn't take much to mess up your ride over, and over, and over again. Boring. My main gripe is the background music (think 90's grunge metal), and there doesn't seem to be a way to turn it off. Overall I would not recommend it or buy it again."
4,Really Awesome Game,"This game is incredible. Truely amazing! The graphics are unbelievable and there are 16 tricks, all really easy to pull off. There are stadium supercrosses (a true challenge), cross country enduros, freestyle competitions, and MAXXIS nationals. There is also of course a Pro-Career where you can unlock MAXXIS courses and stadium courses. You can also like a 10 minute training session to learn the basic controls about the game which I think is ingenius. I reccomend that if you have a friend over and you wanna play the game, have them take the training course so they know the basic controls and you don't have to explain it to them. This game is really good the first 3 or 4 weeks you have it, but I didn't give it 5 stars because after that period of time, it is not nearly as fun as it used to be and if that is your only PS2 game, and you are short on cash, you will quickly find yourself temporarily running back to your old PS1 or N64."
3,Great game. Very easy career mode.,"ATV is one heck of an amazing game, it has stunning graphics as well as terrific gameplay. Best of all it is super fun to play! I would have to say the 'Cross Country Endro' is one of the most fun things to play since 'Smugglers Run' which also lets you drive anywhere.The biggest drawback to the game (thus the 3 star rating) is that the career mode was just too easy. I found that only about 3 of the tracks proved to be challenging. My favorite part of any racing type game is the ""career"" mode- and to find this one to be this non-challenging was a big dissapointment. I probably mastered the whole thing in less than 15 hours of gameplay. I would hope that most [games at this price] would give you at least 30-50 hours of great gameplay.Still, it will be fun to play with my friends in the multi-player mode- and explore the VAST enviornments in the endro mode. I recommend this for your collection- but just don't expect huge gaming time."
2,"Amazing technology, not a fun game","I have no doubt that this is a totally accurate simulation of riding a 4 wheeler. Unfortunatly, the game is not fun at all. It's totally slow-paced; the play modes and tracks are all very similar; the trick-based game is a complete letdown and the game is very difficult. After spending a week trying to get past the third track in pro mode, I gave up on this game. Yeah, maybe I'not good at video games, but SSX was a billion times more fun. I struggled on some courses, and eventually got through. Same experience with Tony Hawk. This, however, is just not a fun game."
2,"Good attempt, bad execution","This game has a great concept. Race quads in races and get your self further up the ladder of ranks. What this game needs though, is a ugrade system that of like the Gran Turismo series. You should start out with some money, or basic quad. Win races, get money, upgrade quad. Then buy new quad, and so on and so on. Instead, you pick what ever you want, and the game is quite easy. The phyics in the game are pretty good, I must admit."
4,really cool game but...,I own two atv's so I thouhgt this game would be cool to have.The tracks and courses are really good and a blast to tear up.The controls are pretty good and precise.The AI cheats sometimes if your are leading on the last lap is suddenly is there right on your rear wheels.The game designers should have done their research a little more...the Lakota and Mojave are both 4 strokes and the Polaris 400 is a 2 stroke but they made the Kawasakis sound like 2 strokes and the Polaris sound like a 4 stoke when it is a 2 stroke.It might be a minor detail but come on.Over all the game is great fun and I would recommend it.
4,awesome game,"I have 2 ATVs so I had to get this game.First off the atvs are very detailed and the graphics are excellent.The freestyle course is awesome,you can get serious air time.The thing I did notice was that the game designers have the Lakota and Mojave sounding like 2 strokes when they are 4 stroke engines,the same way with the Polaris 400,it is a 2 stroke and they made it sound like a 4.When you race against the computer it always seems to cheat.The computer can jump alot farther than you can,and they get up faster when they crash.Other than those querks the game is really good."
5,The new #1 PS2 Game! and i dont like racing,me and alot of my friends rented this game and i ended up paying like 20 dollars late charges because i just couldn't take it back! It has so many great options on how to play! i personally love the freestyle! it is so lifelike that even when you wreck it looks awesome! a 10.5 easy
5,Spy High Mission 3,Title: Spy High Mission 3Author: A.J. ButcherGenre: Action and Adventure-There's a deadly new drug on the streets of America. Drac is instantly and horribly addictive and turns its users into zombies with a desperate craving for blood. Every agent from Spy High has been assigned to discover its source - even the trainees. But one member of Bond Team won't be joining the hunt. Jennifer Chen is following a dangerous trail of her own. She's got some private business with a street gang called the Serpents.

In this series they just keep getting better and better.-I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action and adventure stories.
1,Form 1 to 10 with 10 being the best.,"I give this record a number 0 that's how bad it is. unless you have a lot of money don't by this one. All the rest of his song are good, I give them all about between 6 and 10, but thes one was just put out there. There was a time when I saw his name on sometheng I would get it.. But that was then, this is now. That was a GOOD name for it STUPID!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the box set hoping to get a good documentary,but alhtough informative all three episodes are not even close to anything produced by History channel.I love history,but this documentaries are indeed a boring!"
4,Good read!,Gives a great insight on the golf swing and golf shots. Helps you understand the way to put spin on the ball to curve shots.
2,50 YEARS OF GOLFING WISDOM,INTERESTING BUT DON'T EXPECT TO BUILD MUCH OF A GOLF SWING... JOHN JACOBS IS AN EXCELLENT TEACHER FROM THE OLD SCHOOL AND I WANTED MORE TECHNIQUE BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED..
2,"Made cheap, handle broke first use","Still use the boiler which was the reason I got it. Kinda sad the handle broke so quick, but we just use an oven mitt all the time with it."
5,Great book,This book is great Ty Cobb teaches you all of his secrets and relationships between other players in his time he even picks his all time team that he would go against anyone today and he said he would beat anyone with his all time team I think he probably wouldThis book is a must for a Cobb fan and a must if you are a baseball fan
3,"+1/2 -- Loud, fuzzy, menacing garage rock","The late, legendary Greg Shaw's last signing to Bomp is a fitting cap to his career in A&R. This Seattle-based quartet's psych-garage-punk is loud and distorted, with fuzz and reverb duking it out for the soul of the guitars, and vocals that drive the preamps way past their limits. It's a primordial rock 'n' roll experience of blues progressions left to fester in the garage until the guitars and organ mold into a howl and the drums regress to Neanderthal rhythms. There are plenty of antecedents here, including The Sonics, Seeds, Lyres, and Doors, and yet the Invisible Eyes don't sound like a copy of any one of 'em. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [2005 hyperbolium dot com]"
5,A Lifeline,"This is THE best book on child grief...I have them all (out of necessity) and cannot recommend this book more highly. I was given this by the director of our Cove group and felt as if I'd been thrown a lifeline...it's been just over five years for us and I give copies of appropriate sections to my children's teachers at the start of every school year. In addition, it continues to be helpful after this many years because of the emphasis on the fact that children ""regrieve"" as they mature and hit different developmental milestones. It allows me, as my children get older, to anticipate the next phase and prepare...invaluable as a single mother. The Emswilers haven't been wrong yet."
2,"Too short, not a lot of information..","I should start off by saying that this is the first ever graphic novel I've read!The story is about a girl named Leah Winters who finds a letter that her sister dropped. It is signed ""Love, Jessica"" and Leah begins to wonder if her sister is gay. She receives a phone call with the person on the other end saying that they could explain it. She goes to the meeting place and her adventure begins. BUT before any huge plot could come in place the story freakin' ends! I absolutely was not expecting that. There was about 30 more pages, but it was a sample of a completely different story...apparently thats how a lot of comics are. Anyways, I should be getting volume 2 in the mail pretty soon. I will read/review that.The graphics: Well, this comic is in black/white and, like I said, I have never read a comic before so I don't know what's a great comic and what's not when it comes to the art. I didn't pay a huge amount of attention to the pictures but they looked okay."
3,Quite a surprise.,"Rivkah, Steady Beat, vol. 1 (Tokyopop, 2005)Not at all what I was expecting, I must say. Leah, one of her school's star soccer players, finds a love letter belonging to her sister Sarai signed ""Love, Jessica."" And worse, her mother's a Southern senator, and a Republican to boot. Rather than simply asking the question, Leah decides to investigate-- and it doesn't help that there seems to be a blackmailer involved. Not a bad beginning at all. Can't wait till vol. 2 comes in for me. ***"
3,"almost there, but not quite","i was expecting more....character development is *really* important to me... and i feel that there was not enough of it. i didn't get the sense of *knowing* the characters at all. this isn't to say the author didn't flesh out the characters in their head - maybe some of it just didn't communicate itself well across the pages. there were certainly scenes where you felt the potential for it, but ultimately it was a bit absent.solid art style, paneling, toning. good premise.for those who are more plot-centric, not people centric, this may yet be a good read for you."
4,A good investment,"I agree with the reviewers who said that the title of the book is a misnomer. It is certainly not a workbook, but an informative guide to understanding the graphic design process. The examples used to illustrate the various aspects of design are a great inspiration to anyone working in desktop publishing and design.Shrimati CharanTrinidad and Tobago"
4,Great Book,"Books are getting expensive these days, and with so much information about graphic design available for free online it is usually hard for me to justify spending my hard earned dollars on books when I could probably find the information online. However, that being said I did find this book useful enough to purchase it and I am glad I did. It's nice to have it as a reference and available when I want it.Jeff[...]"
3,disappointed!,"Ok, so what does the word ""workbook"" mean to you? To me it means there will be exercises in the book for the reader to complete which aid in learning. Not in ""The Layout Workbook"" there aren't. I realize that a topic as subjective as graphic design isn't the easiest to do that for without an instructor actually looking at what you do, but I'm disappointed that there isn't something more hands-on than sidebars with factors to consider in a design. Designers who've been to art school probably already know everything in this book and have no need for it but those of us flying by the seat of our pants could use all the help they can get. And holy smokes, NO INDEX!! That said, the information in the book is extremely useful, but it is a mostly narrative-based presentation of information with example pieces telling ""what works"" (not even any examples of ""what doesn't work""), but it isn't a ""workbook""."
3,Not much layout - more of a basic graphic design book,"Deceptive title. Expected more in-depth material on layouts, grids and publication design. Turned out to be more of a graphic design basics book that gives surface level info on various design concepts. Not really a workbook either - no interactive exercises or anything. Last 1/3 of the book basically profiles various design firms and certain print publications they've created. Again - very surface level analysis.Not recommended for intermediate/advanced designers."
5,How I found this book,"I don't remember how I found this book, or why I bought it.It changed my life.This book is the reason I decided to change my major and apply for the Digital Arts program at my school. The layouts portrayed are that of beauty, simplicity, and originality.It made me want to draw, it made me want to think, it made me want to be."
3,Not What I thought,"You will learn something if you are a novice, but if you have already taken a layout course this book doesn't offer you much."
4,Layout Workbook,This was a great buy and I am very happy. The delivery was quick and the book is in great shape. Thanks!
1,Islamophobic!,One of the books that are responsible for accentuating stereotypes and supporting Islamophobia.
3,Hyperactive editing brings this one down,"As others have noted, beware the editing on this thing: shots are rarely held more than a second (it's often cut to the beat of the track), so don't expect to really study anything about any member's performance. This got really tiresome as the video progressed. Naturally, the performances themselves are excellent and the ""concept"" of the concert works really well.The editing though, oh it burns my eyes..."
5,Heavy Metal Hit :),I bought this item for my boyfriend who loves heavy metal and is obsessed with Opeth. He LOVED it and it was so easy to buy. And the shipping was superfast! If you know someone who loves metal or heavy metal music i recommend this! Even after a month he is still talking about it!
3,The performance is certainly anything but flawless,"I really wanted to love this live album; the setlist is undeniably a killer and IMHO album by album much better than the one in The Roundhouse Tapes. But other than the editing issue that has been brought out there's a fatal flaw in this effort: it's shocking how watered down and monotonous Akerfeldt's harsh vocals are in this album. He has been watering down his harsh vocals over the years in the studio albums since Blackwater Park, but here he is absolutely unrecognizable. Maybe he is conserving his vocal chords for the extremely long setlist, but even so the bottom line is that vocally he's a huge disappointment. I still give this album 3 stars for the other instruments, for Akerfeldt's clean vocals (which are still very good) and for the already mentioned killer setlist, but if you are looking for a live album showing the Opeth magic the Roundhouse tape would be a far better choice."
3,Dreadful Editing,"The performance, audio, songs and photography are all excellent. However, for nearly three hours you are subjected to an endless assault of quick cut editing that pretty much ruins the whole DVD. No shot exceeds 2 seconds and most are only 1 second. This dvd demands a re-editing and re-release. It's totally ruined by a production company called Dash Productions LTD."
3,"Flawless performance, obnoxious editing!","This is definitely the best performance I've seen from Opeth: extremely precise and coordinated, technical and like always, full of emotions. Unfortunately, the very poor camera editing makes you nauseated and leaves you with a headache from the very beginning! I seriously had to look away from the screen many times to be able to enjoy the music. I am so sad about this and I hope that they realize their poor editing job and release a better version (very unlikely though)."
4,Imporvisation & Mindfulness!! Who woulda thunk?!!,"'Heard Ms. Zaporah on University of New Mexico's KUNM's (radio) Women's News (2006). She sounded fun and into mindfulness. Her book provides exercises, mostly for groups, for expanding mindfulness and developing abilities to handle risk and change."
2,Product Image NOT Correct,"It's my fault for not paying closer attention, but realize that the image shown is of an *8oz* canister, NOT a 4oz canister (which is what they're selling/shipping) - I consider this borderline false advertising - so buyer beware.Performance-wise it seems to work OK. I have an MSR Reactor stove and the few quick tests I did the canister snugged up fine,didn't leak, and burned as expected.Final Thoughts: If I'd have realized these were 4oz canisters, I wouldn't have bought them - I jumped on the deal because I thought they were 8oz (as in the picture) - so just keep that in mind when you're looking."
5,Med. encyclopedia,Mosby's Medical Encyclopedia is the best by far! It has really helped me understand the anatomy of the human body. It is real simple and complex to read. I am a student at Methodist Hospital School of Nursing; it is a brillant piece of craftmanship.
4,"Paul Simon Greatest Hits, Etc","Another review in harmony with others already posted. Yes, this ranks as a collectors item, with the lovely Slip Slidin', Something So Right and I Do It For Your Love exhibiting the smooth melodic and harmonic composition skills of Paul Simon.[Note the deliberate humour in the album title ... Greatest Hits ETC. Not all the songs in this collection are ""greatest"".]I agree with the comment about Columbia declining to resurrect this recording in digital form (I have the cassette tape, and already some of the sound quality is deteriorating). Head-in-the-sand mentality from copyright owners does indeed encourage 'sharing'."
1,Disappointing,"I could not begin to summarize this book. The style in which it is written defies categorization. It seems to follow the general form of a memoir of sorts, but it is disjointed, not in any type of chronological order that I can discern, and goes off onto side tangents and/or unrelated snippets of dialogue just about every other page. It is maddening, for me in my linear thinking, to try to read!It is evidently a Christian book, and most of its other Amazon reviewers seem to claim it contains both humor and profound Biblical revelations. But I will never have the patience to tease these out of its ADHD-driven storytelling style. I tossed it after the first chapter or two."
4,Great story about rethinking life,"Mark Steele's book is very funny with a lot of different life stories to keep you laughing and get a point across. His main goal is to let the reader see how he used to do things to gain popularity and for his own benefit, under the guise of working for God.Instead we see how he learns to take changes and really give up himself for others. Most of these epiphanies come during mission trips where he's completely out of his comfort zone.The book is very entertaining. The message is decent though I would have preferred more practical ways that we can change our own lives. Instead we see how his own life experiences have changed his life. It's much closer to an autobiography with a message of humility and taking chances."
3,Cute . . . Review Haiku,Flashbang. Funny guy.Good start. Where do we go now?Loud noise but no point.
2,For Solitaire Devotees Only,"There are enough solitaire games here for every taste and level of expertise, including some most people have probably never heard of. Visually, the color and layout are nice. But the rules for some of the lesser-known games are a little hard to follow. This is not up to the standards of the Sierra Hoyle games, but is a decent way to pass some quiet time, if that is what you are looking for. As for ""Murder, She Wrote"", it is nothing more than 4 half-hearted quicky murder mysteries, with accompanying jigsaw puzzles of the crime scenes. Jessica Fletcher/Angela Lansbury fans will not be impressed."
5,Fab little knife.,Opens and closes very smoothly. Extremely sharp. Kershaw has a great reputation for a reason. This is an all around awesome little knife :)
5,Quality Knife.,"Easy to open with either hand, good size for pocket, good weight, doesn't feel too light or too heavy. Definitely looks and feels high quality. Highly recommend this knife."
5,Great Knife,"Great knife. VERY sharp right out of the box and feels solid in the hand. Smooth opening action, can't really complain about anything."
5,Expands your culinary abilities.........,"Le Cordon Bleu at Home is an exciting book. It demonstrates classic French cooking techniques and menus accompanied by beautiful photography!! It is a step by step book arranged in lessons/chapters to be followed at your own pace. While not every menu item may be to your liking, there is enough variety that you can progress through this book to add to your culinary skills and interests. Learning the basics of classic French cooking is both interesting, entertaining and beneficial. This is a great book to learn and experiment with, for anyone who has a passion for food."
2,There's only 1 picture for approximately each 6 or 7 recipies!,"I'm a self-taught cook at home. I found books that has step-by-step pictures for each recipe are very easy to learn. This book has only one picture for approximately each 6 or 7 recipies! At the end, it has pictures for general subject like ""how to make dough"", etc. But these pictures are hard to see because they're very small. Also they do not show the dishes after they have been completely cooked.I prefer ""Le Cordon Bleu's complete cooking techniques"". It has more than one picture for each recipe. However, it has much fewer recipies. Besides, those recipies are very basic."
3,Meant for an advanced french cook.,This book is your typical coffee table cookbook. Not much use for a beginner cook. The recipes are too complicated and require a lot of ingredients. Makes you uninterested to even start french cooking. I'm lactose intolerant and most of the dishes require some kind of milk product.
3,Not what I was looking for.,"Should have had a side note that not only will the book set you back but you won't be able to afford any of the ingredients. I understand French Cooking is an art however, I haven't been able to even use the book!"
4,"Nothing new but, hell - it's CANNED HEAT!!!!!","The clearest sound yet of ANY recorded Canned Heat tunes. Okay, so GOING UP THE COUNTRY is not here, so what?! These are the 'HEAT' tunes that made you sit-up and listen. If you don't have any 'early' CANNED HEAT and GOING UP THE COUNTRY is the only tune you know by this legendary (white) blues band, pick this up, play it loud, and enjoy a pleasant surprise!"
3,Voice/Background not Good,"Microphone/Background not Good. He still sings well but the audio taping of the concert was below par. Still I was glad I saw it. He truly is a fantastic performer. If not for his showmanship and voice, I would have given a 1 for the DVD taping of the concert."
3,Great concert,Michael doing his thing live in front of a massive audience. This concert is full of energy and life and showcases his amazing talent to entertain his fans.The dancers are pretty amazing as well!
3,FFF interferes with an exalted experience,"This concert video is high quality, with excellent sound and good close-up footage.Michael is such a wonderful dancer and performer. You want to keep your eyes on him at all times.How frustrating, then, to have the camera constantly pull away to show the crowd. Right in the middle of intricate dance steps! What a waste! Sure it conveys excitement, but how many fainting young people do we have to see passed hand over hand through the crowd to the medics? Someone was really misguided here. There are also a lot of cutaways to the other musicians, but at least this makes more sense, and is part of what we want to see - the performance. If I wanted the other, I could look in the mirror and scream Michael and hyperventilate till I passed out.When the camera is on Michael, though, it is worth it.There should be a warning sticker: ""Excessive FFF"" (Freakin Fan Footage)."
5,Simply Amazing!,"The video quality is great considering when this concert took place! MJ always delivered on stage and he certainly does in this concert. Out of all of the songs, I'd say my favorite performance in this concert is Billie Jean. The freestyle dancing was really fascinating toward the end of the song. Overall, you will fall in love with this concert!"
4,Great Micheal Jackson concert,"Really a great DVD, with great music and dancing. The only problem it was of poor quality.Other than that I enjoyed it."
5,Amazing concert but flawed,"I saw this concert on Vh1 on TV several times. I kept looking up bootleg DVDs of this concert and then I got this on my birthday. But a friend of mine was pretty annoyed by what she saw. What we saw was too many shots of the audience reactions. She thinks MJ's fans are ridiculous like that. Also, Jackson kept on crotch-grabbing which she thinks he went too far.Also, we saw that several shots were not from Bucharest. I saw London Monza Paris Lausanne Toulouse blah blah. Why couldn't the footage shot be only on Bucharest itself"
5,For the love of MJ,i first sow this on vh1 a very long time ago and now with the passing of MJ i really wanted this DVD to enjoy what i sow that long time ago...so for the review its just as i remembered a very sweet performance by MJ
5,Awesome!!!,I recommend this for anyone wanting to enjoy the MJ experiance. This is a fantastic concert. I was rivited.
5,EXCELLENT QUALITY - what are you waiting for?,"If you are a true MJ fan, you must get this DVD!!!!!!granted, it shows the audience a lot, but that just goes to show you how crazy MJ fans are! I love yall!!I highly recommend this dvd!!!!!!! You won't regret it! It's so worth your money!"
4,FOUR STARS FOR A FIVE STARS SUPERSTAR,"Before the man,there was the music and the show.Michael Jackson is the Elvis presley and the Beatles of our time(80's & 90's).He is the first megastar to break the western's frontier of superstardom(not an hearsay).Live in Bucharest(92-Romania) is not some John Doe scratching his guitar in front of some overused diehard fans.This is Showbusiness.The only reason i put a blanket in one star is to save it for later.Can a career rebound be possible??? As for the sinner(allegations of wrongdoing) i'd rather go with my personal jurisprudence:""case by case.Justice well done is unjustice denied(vice versa)"".Buy it..."" Man in the mirror"" is a masterpiece.This dvd is a t.k.o.Sound:-louder is requested. Be a music lover...Buy it!"
5,THE BEST!!!!!!,"WHAT A VIDEO, AMAZING, EXTRAORDINALRY. MICHAEL JACKSON SHOWS IN THE VIDEO WHAT HE IS CALLED 'THE KING OF POP'. HE WAS, IS AND WILL BE STILL THE GREATEST ENTERTAINMENT IN THE WORLD. WHAT AN ENERGY, PASSION, LOVE AND PROFFESIONALISM. YOU GOT A HAVE IT. NOBODY LIKE HIM. HE WAS INCOMPARABLE AND UNIQUE. YOU'LL ENJOY IT. MJ THE BEST FOEVER"
2,"Well, It is Michael Jackson, but...",Onkyo receiver - CheckThunderous Surround Sound - Check50 Inch Panasonic Plasma - CheckThrilled (no pun intended) with this concert - NOPEVERY Disappointing. It is the HBO special. They did NOTHING to this DVD. Picture quality is poor - Sound is poor. I'm going to watch my Alicia Keyes DVD now...THAT's a GREAT production - someone needs some tips. I'm glad it was only $12.99.
2,Touches himself WAY too much....,"I agree with the review that said it shows the audience too much. WAY too much. And speaking of stuff that's over the top--MJ touches himself so many times on stage it looks like he is (rhymes with masticating). Not recommended for kids, which is kind of ironic, because in his Heal the World song on this concert video, he brings a bunch of kids onstage holding hands. This dude was WEIRD."
3,If only he had a better wardrobe,"I am going to sound really shallow, but I found it difficult to enjoy this DVD to its full potential because of the yellow bikini shirt. As the other reviewers stated, there is too much fan reaction as well. This is one of those DVDs that disappoint because you know that MJ can do better. I know there are better stuff out there. I have the Live in Japan too, but it also has shortcomings. I don't know if MJ did this on purpose so that his fans would still want to see him live. If so, it is definitely working on me! Unfortunately, MJ can no longer perform live, and I sure hope there are better stuff out there to show how wonderful a performer he is."
4,Fans drown out MJ,"The video is great when it focuses on Michael, however, there are too many fan shots. I don't care if girls are passing out, I want to see Michael sing and dance. Also, sometimes it is difficult to hear MJ over the constant roar of the crowds. Otherwise, MJ is brilliant, as always. He will forever be the King of Pop."
4,Michael Jackson,"This is definately the best of Michael Jackson. Except for the hand over his crotch several times, the moves are definately Jackson, and no one can compare"
4,Very cool concert video,I really liked this concert on video. I have allways enjoyed Michaels music and his talent to dance is just amazing. I would recommend this if you are a fan of Michael and want to see a good concert and the ending well I wont give it away..
5,My Favorite People,"I never had the pleasure of seeing Michael Jackson in concert while he was alive, and I was so brokenhearted when he died. I never thought that I would be able to experience the excitement that he brought to everyone at one of his concerts! That is until I received my copy of his concert ""Live in Bucharest"". I can't tell you how excited I was to see him in action on stage! Believe me I was not dissapointed, it was the next best thing to being there live! I especially enjoyed watching the reaction of the people screaming, and fainting at his every move. There will never be another entertainer that can capture the hearts, and the emotions that Michael did! This was one of the best investments I have ever made, and I'll have it forever! I can watch it over and over whenever I feel the need to! By the way the quality is excellent, I highly recommend this DVD!!Long Live Michael Jackson, the King of Pop!Thank you for the memories!Joe Salas in Dallas!"
4,Been there...,"sorry, this is not really a review of the product since I didn't buy it yet... - just wanted to let you know that those girls were *mainly* fainting because of the lack of... air, not because they'd seen MJ..! - almost incredible, but sardines in a can were more comfortable... - now, what pushed everybody (physically) closer and closer to MJ (and made the first rows to evaporate due to massive fainting) is another story... - yes, the MJ's performance, the show itself, were outstanding. I will buy the DVD whatever the sound... maybe I can see myself there!"
3,Disappointing,Very disappointed with this DVD. Way too focused on the hysterical audience instead of MJ's performance. Too much lip syncing on MJ's part also.
5,can't remember too much of it but it was fun.,this game was great i think i do not have this but i rented it back when you could still rent super nintendo games and it's fun. i just got to a few levels though. :(
1,Oh Yeah!,Oh! come on this game isnt that easy. It is so hard. This game has too many confusing puzzels. If you looking for something Really fun try something a little easier.
2,2 stars,ok well here's the scup i think this game is not worth the price to be payed for it.one of the reasons is because the game is not exciting and is not fun it's really easy and no compation
2,confused,When we ordered this game we did so because it said it came with box and DIRECTIONS it does not have any directions and we can not figure out how to get past the first screen. If any one can help me with some simple commands on this game please put it in a review or let me know how to get you my e-mail
3,keep in mind,"The practice of hiragana and katakana is fairly easy and any serious japanese student is going to become used to reading at least hiragana right away, that being said; I think the lack of kana on these cards is highly over-hyped and it is important to realize that cards like these are great for practicing with someone who isnt really interested in learning kana i.e. your spouse, casual friend or anyone else that might be kind enouph to help you study ! Your going to get plenty of practice with kana just reading japanese!!!!"
5,Very useful companion,"These cards are very useful for memorizing kanji if you learn through flashcards effectively. The cards are rather small however, and one must be careful not to misplace/lose any of them since there are so many. The box they come in also is very tight, trying to get them all back in properly is a bit of a task, so you may want to find some other holder to place your kanji cards in instead."
4,An excellent language learning source!,"I own the Tuttle Kanji Cards I and II. When I first started using these, I only knew about 80 kanji, now I know around 600. What I liked the best about these cards were: 1.) It has a stroke order (in the first set of cards) and shows you how to draw them.2.) It comes with 4 combinations per card. (some do repeat however, and it doesn't tell you if that particular kanji can be used alone, but I suppose a kanji dictionary would suffice for that)3.) It breaks it up into two parts (unless it's a kanji radical), which can help in memorization.4.) The cards are divided into grades, which gives you some idea of how much you actually know.(my recommendation for learning: learn in a set of 10, and repeat that set until you memorize it. I usually learn about 50 cards at once this way. Even memorizing 100 cards in one sitting is possible!)"
1,There are better cards on the market,"These cards are alright, but the cards by White Rabbit Press are a true 5 star product. The Tuttle cards are small, thin, have only 4 kanji compounds, many of which are not commonly used. They have some typos, and the overall design is kind of ugly--the indentation is not consistent and the stroke order diagrams are handwritten! The White Rabbit Japanese Kanji Flashcards by comparison are beautifully designed poker-size cards with 6 compounds, look-alike characters and *imporant* hiragana and katakana (instead of romaji), and they come in a very nice box. It's hard to get the tuttle cards back into their box."
1,Try another product,"I have tried hand made cards and the Tuttle Kanji Cards - OK, but easily lost or bent, and hard to organize. I just received the White Rabbit Press Japanese Flashcards - these are keepers! They are the size of standard playing cards, durable, easy to read and have stroke order as well as examples on the cards. And they fit neatly back into their box!"
2,better at half the price,This book is best at providing numbers and addresses for the various companies that do mods. Because the book is a bit old some of the data is not helpful.Many of the chapters are just reprinted articles from magazines.
4,preview of what is to come...,"As an individual interested in USMC OCS and earning the Eagle, Globe and Anchor, I found this to be a motivating and exciting read. There are no false promises or shading of truth, the author describes challenges that are instore in a way that presents them as real, and real hard. The reader can feel energy and identify with those attempting the very difficult. The most interesting section of this book was the comparison of candidates from two different generations and the surprising similarities that appeared. It is not a cheap book, but if you are interested in becoming an Officer of Marines it is a required text to consume before making that decision."
5,What They Fought For,"We should not forget the labor wars of the early 20th century and that people fought and died for the 8-hour day, a living wage, weekends, paid overtime and all the rest we who work in offices take for granted. Those things can easily be lost unless we remind ourselves of the people who stood up for them and for all of us who work for a livng. Sitting at a computer is the new factory assembly line."
4,Labor Movement Literature,"I saw this reviewed on one of the public television shows. I read it, then passed it on to my Union to add to their library. Excellent work, very informative."
2,Written for EU Citizens,"This book could be useful if you are a EU citizen relocating for a job. I have read books that don't apply to me at all and still found them very interesting, but this one is a very factual, and not very inspiring."
4,Rikki Tikki Tavi is not Tikki Tikki Tembo,"Like Heath, I also remembered two different books from my childhood that seemed to have the same title. After doing some research on the Internet I finally figured it out: There is this wonderful Kipling book about the mongoose and then there is the childrens' book Tikki Tikki Tembo by Arlene Mosel where poor little Chang falls into a well and his brother Tikki tikki tembo-no sa rembo-chari bari ruchi-pip peri pembo tries to save him but gets winded just trying to tell his name to the people he is asking for help. I too have memories of having this book read aloud to me in the library as a child."
4,"informative, mind boggling, lots of profanity","this video is definitely meant for more mature audiences. the content was very good, it is meant more for folks who are following a 12 step program or for those considering a 12 step. lots, and lots of profanity"
1,great looking but they chip & plates split in half,My husband and I fell in love with the look of the Sango Nova Brown and bought 2 sets. We've added accessory pieces soon after. Within a month two dinner plates simply cracked down the middle! Then another and another. Also several smaller salad dish's. I've replaced them only because they are such a perfect color. but if another plate cracks down the middle the whole lot is going and I'll be searching for another pattern from another company. I'm heartbroken that such a wonderful pattern is on a poorly made product. Don't waste your money like we did.
4,nova blue completer,"2 pieces arrived broken, I had to send the entire set back, Amazon reported that they were out of stock. The dishes were beautiful and I hope to find another set,"
2,crack right across the center,"Had a look at the picture and I love the color. We love the look of the dishes, but the dinner plates have begun to crack right across the center. This is not normal wear, it is a flaw. We are very disappointed."
1,Not practical,"We registered and received all nova dinnerware for our wedding. I think that it is very attractive. Unfortunately, it's been sitting in our cabinet for 6 years without being used. I planned on using it for entertaining, but it scratches SO easily. I can't have people over and tell them that they can't use a knife on my plates, and even regular forks can mess up the surface. Even though they have only been used maybe 6 times total, the plates show a lot of marks - not just scratches but places where the glossy finish is worn off. Since the plates aren't being used, neither is the serving set. I'm going to just get rid of the whole mess and free up some cabinet space."
4,I give it a B,When first beginning I did not think I'd enjoy it but it actually pulled me in relatively quickly. I enjoyed Jill Gregory's writing style. One was able to see what was in the character's mind. If it was an option I'd give it3 1/2 stars not quite 4 but better than 3
4,book,Her books are always well written and are easy readers. They move right along and do not have a lot of unnecessary words to take up pages.
3,Good vacation read,"It's a fun and interesting story about a lifestyle that most people know little about. I found myself wanting to know more about what made the characters the way they were, to delve deeper into their psyches and histories. Tantalizing tidbits floated through the story, but were often not ever explained. However, after reading the story, I could picture the ""backyard"" of the circus and see the characters as they went about life on the road.There were many amusing points, and some poignant ones. Most of us women who've lived a little have had ""Larry""s in our lives...I thought that it was well-developed, considering that Mary wrote it for the NaNoWriMo contest. Mary tells a good story and can always be counted on for a laugh."
4,Engrossing,"I was caught up in this look into the world of a travelling circus from the very start, and really enjoyed seeing the story unfold. It would have been very easy to bury the reader in cryptic circus jargon or to over-explain everything, but the unusual setting was handled well. The story and characters, while simple, were believable and consistent. A very nice book."
3,Good first book,This is an interesting first book by a novice author. The dialog needs some work--stylistically it began to bother me after awhile. But the story held my interest and I learned a lot about life on the road with a small circus. A worthwhile read. Looking for more from this author.
4,Performs Well,"I got this 17"" HP notebook 5 days ago (22JUL07). General impression: I did the right thing buying it for home use. For business I will continue to use an Asus V6J.The Good: good performance, nice UI, generous screen, thin and light (for a 17"").Not so good: too many little blue lights (18 including the xb3000 docking); the silver plastic looks cheap; stickers didn't peel easily.I would recommend this 17"" notebook for home use."
1,hp sucks,the motherboard well over heat and hp well charge u 400.00 for a new one that well over heat in time.do not get this computer!
2,Not bad,"This was really a very good system for me until 4 months back. First its battery dried out and when I replaced it, I am seeing constant issues with my display. It hangs anytime, if I try to start laptop it restarts many times, even sometimes it blacks out automatically. Having horrible experience now with this laptop."
2,Aggravatingly SLOW machine!!,"I can't even stand to work on this computer because it is so slow. I use my 4 year old Dell desktop instead whenever possible because it is twice as fast. I don't know what the problem is...maybe another GB of RAM is needed to run vista. It takes about 90 seconds to open a WORD document, or an Outlook email. It is a nice looking machine with a great display and keyboard. The performance is the only problem for me."
2,Why Bother!,"This is a slow machine, the webcam is not working all the times and the DVD freezes. Contacting HP via Phone you get connected somewhere else in the world and when you are asking for help via the chat up line, they are telling you to update the BIOS yourself! even though the machine is a month old and still under warranty!"
5,Wakefield novel,I bought this previously .35 cent paperback at my husbands' request. He'd always wanted to read something by this author. He was mesmorized by it.
1,Foreign production of possibly a recent television special,"All tracks in the CD are live recordings made from one performance. Two tracks are medleys with about 10 to 30 seconds per song. Amazon claims these as five separate items on the CD, although one could give the benefit that the whole CD is like one continual track. Comedy and philisophical one liners occur in and throughout the songs. Banjo and Bluegrass is the format of the entire performance and in my opinion it is a poor fit for Glen's standards such as Rhinestone Cowboy, Gentle on My Mind, and Galveston. The jacket states that the CD is made in EEC, wherever that is. No claim is made to the location or date of the recording."
4,A Hard Sell,"On a strange planet somewhere exist a race of crazy collectors willing to pay extravegant sums for VHS copies of old movies readily available for much cheaper on DVD. The sellers trying to off-load these Videos should wise up and get rid of them for as little as possible ( unless they paid a fortune for them and need to get their money back).On to the movie itself, I saw this on video years ago and enjoyed it, the picture quality was pretty rough (it wasn't the version on offer here).I would imagine the Warner Archive DVD will be a pretty good print and would lift my appreciation of this film to new hights and I'm glad it's finally out on DVD.Not a big budget, but it's George Sanders and he's the lead."
3,A man and the women in his life,"George Sanders is the main character of this B-Movie of 50s. The principal attraction is the list of female names: Yvonne de Carlo, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Collen Gray,and Nancy Gates. And one of them is the murderer. A VHS sometimes difficult to find, probably around May/2012 the DVD will appear. The film is in public domain. Fans enjoy the dialogue, and the music of Max Steiner."
5,Great Movie!,"Support Your Local Sheriff is one of those great comedic efforts written back when the viewing public was intelligent enough to ""get it"". The characters and the writing is first rate. Casting should have won an Oscar! Humour from beginning to end with subtle and obvious one liners throughout.5 stars barely is enough. Should be 10 STARS!"
3,Not for North America,"Not sure if it was my fault, or if its in the fine print and I missed it, but this copy is not made for the US. I did end up purchasing the product later that was made for the US not sure why Amazon think I was reviews the same product when it clearly is not the same product."
1,Support Your Local Sheriff,"I could not be more disappointed. I loved this movie as a kid and when I saw it recently on local television, I thought, ""what a fun movie to share with my children and grandchildren,"" so when I found the DVD was available on Amazon, I purchased it. The DVD was represented as new and it came in sealed packaging. With my children and grandchildren gathered around last weekend (all 12 of us), I put the DVD into the player only to find the audio faded out completely at least once during every scene. It was frustrating. And, ""No,"" it was not my DVD player; I checked it with another DVD. Apparently, what I purchased was just a poorly burned rip-off."
4,"Funny, Though A Bit Overly Slapstick","Hard not to like a movie with the young James Garner and Harry Morgan. Garner comes to town en route to Australia and takes the job of sheriff as a means to supplement his intended temporary work gold-mining. He comes face to face with an infamous family of killers that has had its way for a long time, killing people left and right. Garner takes them on without hesitation, bests them all - along with their hired guns, and ends up with the mayor's daughter as his bride."
5,g,"Came on time and looked as expected, It will be a gift so I will be waiting to see how much the receiver likes it."
1,producers take note,"Yet another ""oldie but goodie"" formatted without subtitles or captions. When are these producers going to understand some of us are in an older generation and suffer significant hearing loss?Kurt Austermann"
1,Extreme disappointment!!!,I was quite surprised to find the DVD was formatted for play in foreign players only. This quickly became a $13 piece of trash. The information supplied on your web page did not properly convey this fact!!
2,Not family-friendly,"If you're looking for a good clean innocent family-friendly movie, this isn't it.While the plot is entertaining and there are some really funny scenes in the movie, conservative parents will not appreciate the multiple instances of swearing (both the d-word and the h-word), the coarseness of some of the town men to the leading lady (swatting her on the behind, etc.), or the dance hall girls and the innuendos surrounding them. Parents looking for good role models for their kids should also be aware that the leading lady is very disrespectful to her father and is a totally exaggerated (tedious) tomboy who rarely acts like a lady.If these things don't bother you, you'll probably enjoy the film--it IS a funny film. But if you're looking for a 100% wholesome movie for your kids, you'd probably rather spend your money elsewhere."
1,This movie is a waste of thyme!,This movie has no plot. Cows eat grass. So should this movie. It sucks
2,Interesting,"When I saw the first ""It's Alive"" movie in the theatre when I was 17, it scared me so bad I couldn't sleep alone for 3 nights. Funny, when I saw it the other night, I could not figure out what scared me. It is such a funny movie. The cinematography is extremely bad, but I guess it was good for 1976 or whenever it first came out. This movie is not as good as the first and I'm going to watch the third tonight. I'm expecting it to be equally bad."
3,"It looks wonderful,lots of detail- but such a depressing story!","I always like the look of British historical dramas, this one is no exception with its level of detail, but the story itself is so depressing. I think I'd have picked up on the Princess Diana family connection even if I'd never read about it in a review of the movie- the two stories just scream out their similarities.More than three stars for ""look"" and level of detail but the story itself is such an emotional drag down that 3 is all I can give overall."
2,Over produced for the Soap Opera crowd,"AS someone else pointed out, better to read her life story. This film is bottled and packaged for mass consumption and bears little resemblance to the reality. IF you want a much better look at 18th century sturm, drang and unfairness, may I suggest the multi-disk CLARISSA (with the divine Sean Bean). After I watched it, I heaved a sigh and knew what it felt like to see the world as utterly corrupt. IT is truly a fascinating production of a great tale.PS Keira, please EAT something"
4,bluray movies should be better,i spect better picture cuality it is about (28 mbps avc) but i have seen much better than this ¡
4,The duchess,I watched this movie quite a while back and do remember that I enjoyed it but really don't remember any specifics. I bought it because I love Keira Knightley and she doesn't disappoint.
5,DUCHESS,I really enjoyed watching this movie. So same how success had not room for freedom of choice.
3,The Duchess is Sad!!,"It was a great movie for the period, really showed the lifestyle and thought of the day. Which was women are owned by their husbands. Too sad for me."
3,HOT KNIGHTLEY,"Honestly, could Keira Knightley be any hotter than she is in this film; she is simply stunning. I had read that this movie is based on a true story, something about Georgiana being Princess Diana's relative, but whatever..anyway though liberties were obviously taken.i.e. Georgiana never seems to age, I mean 20 kids and she still looks like THAT?!!, it seems for the most part true to the era. The film is interesting on many levels and though it lags at times, for the most part it's paced well. Really, it's a bit hard to feel sorry for a woman so inherently rich, and blessed with such awesome beauty, but at times you feel her Gilded Cage as it closes in on her. She is certainly reckless at times and for the era she acts very Gloria Steinem, which seems anachronistic to say the least. Ralph Fiennes is a boorish presence as always, playing to type. Overall, beautifully filmed, intesting story on some levels, but the real reason to view this is to marval at the exquisite Knightly."
2,An OK movie,"I'm a sucker for movies with period costuming. I love history and generally movies like this appeal to me. Unfortunately, this movie isn't very good. The costuming is great, but there is very little substance to this movie. I read the book prior to seeing the movie and feel that the movie could have been much better. A lot of key historical facts that would have helped the movie make more sense were excluded from the movie. I was expecting more of a docudrama when I sat down to watch this movie and as a result I was sorely disappointed. The costuming, however, did not disappoint."
1,too much immoral sex- leud,I wanted to like this film. I kept watching it until the homosexual scene- too much for me...low class sex scene after sex scene.
4,Men Ruled,"A frank look at how women were treated. You wed early, had a boy, and then were expected to be happy while your husband took liberities with your best friend. You were expected to have a stiff upper lip. Makes me very glad to be living now."
3,Depressing,"I love period movies and buy almost everything I can in this genre; the movie is interesting and I enjoyed watching it; however, it's depressing and quite a downer, has a married rape scene and some other difficult scenes so not the excellence you'd find in Jane Austen movies (BBC collection or Keira Knightley in Pride & Predjudice for example). Not sure I will ever watch again so not sure it was worth buying."
3,An amazing downer,"Although I was very much aware that the Duchess had problems, especially from the awful Bess and her heartless husband, I did not expect the movie to dwell on nothing but her unhappiness. The Duchess was loved by everyone who came within her sphere. The total disregard for her true gifts was disappointing. And no, the brief, overdone, kissing between her and Charles Gray did not signify as happiness. All in all, very sad. With no uplifting moments to cling to, I went to bed miserable...which is NOT my favorite thing to pay for."
4,When the palace becomes a cage.,"Duhcess Georgina is played by Keira Knightly. It is based on the historic Duchess Georgina. Despite her intelligence and beauty, sheis completely beholden to her husband who eventually moves his mistress and her children into her home. Her efforts within the politics of the day were seen as scandalous, although by present standards, her behavior is fairly mild. SHe does fall in love, but her husband ends that affair. In her world, her husband is king, and she is helpless in the midst of luxury.The movie is gorgeous, and I would enjoy it if no plot whatsoever existed. Historic detail is followed to the setting and the costumes. However, the story line and character development are also both well done. So as far as I am concerned, this movie is a keeper."
2,How Many ways Can I say Poor Duchess,"""The Duchess"" hits you over the head with it's conceit. All the beauty is so gray; the director pounces on you, that this isn't your usual costume tragedy. Violence, ignorance, lust is and so forth must follow. With a interesting script, perspective, good acting, some chemistry I might have liked this movie. I believe it had none of these things.Obviously this viewer did not see much to recommend it. Rubbish is how I would describe it; but I also think that shows more feeling than this production deserves."
4,Big tear in the back of case,This DVD came in good timing and was what I ordered. The only complaint is there was a hug tear in the back of the cover. It didn't ruin the summary in the back or pictures but I was a little embarrassed as it was Christmas gift for a friend.
1,Did not watch,The streaming would not work so we could not watch. I certainly hope we were not charged.....but I will check.
5,Wonderful Movie,"The acting in this movie is superb and the characters complex- since it is based on a true story this is not all that surprising. The twists and turns of life and fate challenge all of us. In this movie those challenges are met with both edifying and deeply disappointing results. The set and costumes are fabulous.All told, watching this movie makes me want to read the book."
3,Pointless,"While visually stunning, this movie was pretty much pointless. Real Georgiana was a more complex person than the one portrayed by Keira Knightley, and her life was never defined just by her desire for a happy marriage. She was influential, she had power and admiration, and in this movie the Duchess was reduced to a rich doormat. Georgina's real life story was significantly more exciting. This tepid my-husband-doesn't-love-me-and-doesn't-allow-me-to-have-a-lover version didn't do this notable woman any justice. No depth, no dimensions to the story. Moderately entertaining movie, but deserves not more than an OK rating. Rent it."
3,The Duchess... Nothing Extraordinary,"After watching the Duchess I knew I enjoyed the movie. In fact if I could give it 3 1/2 stars I would. It is a solid film that shows the true nature of infidelity that was paramount in the 18th Century. The story is based off true events and the movie does a fairly decent job at transporting you to that time and place. It is amazing to see how people of royalty lived back then.The reason for the lower review is because there just isn't anything that spectacular or surprising. I would recommend it to friends if they enjoy those time period films but it did not floor me. I thought the story line was average and I never felt any bit of true emotion while watching. You definately won't walk away floored and I doubt you really would have this on your must see list. However if you enjoy Kiera Knightly and the time period this movie is based on, then you should enjoy watching."
3,The costumes are GREAT!,The story is NOT uplifting. We were quite uncomfortable with the content. PG-13? More like an R. Kiera Knightly was better cast in this role than in Pride and Prejudice (Can't stand her grimace/smile as Elizabeth Bennett.) The costumes are absolutely stunning and that is why we bought it. Delivery was swift. Thank you.
5,worth while movies,"wonderful movie very authentic as for the clothing and settings, was great at keeping my attention. actors were superb! recommend it to anyone that is into period movies."
2,Dreadfully dull,"The best thing about this film was looking at the costumes and the surroundings. While Keira Knightly did a good job as the long suffering wife of the Duke of Devonshire, it wasn't enough to make this movie more interesting. Period pieces can veer towards the tedious and boring, which this one was.If anything, what I carried away from this movie, was that women, even those in high society positions such as the Duchess of Devonshire were only secondary citizens to the power and privilege of men."
1,Garbage,"Trashy movie....an affair, another affair, throw in some random mistresses here and there...movie sucks. I understand that a great deal of ""chick flick"" movies are about forbidden love but this movie went over the top and was down right bad."
1,Horrible movie,"This is a terrible movie. I found it extremely disturbing and upsetting. It is so sad and disgusting that a man could treat his wife that way. It was heart-wrenching. It's not a ""chick flick."" It's a tragedy. I keep thinking about the movie but I wish I could block it out of my mind. I wish I had never seen it. The only good thing about it is, it makes me grateful for the loving husband I do have."
1,Ugly story,"I made the mistake of watching this movie without knowing what it is was about. Evidently it was based on actual historical events including another ""dirty duke"" who could do whatever he pleased without censor. If this kind of movie appeals to you, then you will enjoy it. The costumes were gorgeous and the acting was above average."
1,No Plot,"The film should have been given the title, ""The Adulterer and The Adulteress""But then that would have given away the storyline of this entire movie."
1,The Duchess (2008),"Did not like this movie at all. It should have been rated R, then I would not have bought it."
5,Beautifully done,This story was not predictable like I expected it to be. The roles were perfectly played and the costumes and makeup stunning. Well worth watching.
5,The Duchess,"I know what happens to her is so grossly unfair, but it was wonderful to see a movie that contained a mother fully commited to being a mother no matter the costs to herself."
3,Music Score Rates 5 Stars!,"I imagine the biggest draw to this film were the parallels to Princess Di's life and the coincidence of her family ties to Georgiana. I found this film mildly engaging being well aware of the times and constraints on women. But what overwhelmed me was the music score. How does a composer convey the feelings of beauty and opulence at the top level, the deep sadness of rejection and powerlessness, and then the very subtle sense of growth through experience to develop an inner strength that rolls on like a freight train sound? I found the layering a most impressive combination that stayed within me for many days. I also enjoyed the stark contrast of relationships and the directors focus that conveyed the deepest of emotions on screen. Recommend for viewing, purchase, and touching memories of personal identity of love, life, and loss."
3,Love...love,How I love movies that depict the ole days and especially movies past on true historical events. I great birthday gift from my sister.
5,AWESOME MOVIE!,"I love love love this movie, the quality of the digital rental was excellent. I would rent this 100 times!"
5,The Duchess,Great movie based on historical facts. Great cast and movie is well made. Strongly recommend this movie for everyone - it's more thank a chick flick.
5,THE DUCHESS,I really enjoyed this dvd and have watched 3 or 4 times.Also purchased a copy for some of my family as a gift.Great acting and scenery.Dolores N.
2,The Duchess,"The Book was excellent, but this movie (DVD) is soooooooooo Boring!! I can't believe how bad it was. I trashed it!"
3,Think about it.,"This is a good guide, by some standards. It has a serious flaw in the map system, the maps are not helpful and do not indicate the location of the guards... that would have been nice. They offer almost no help with the challenge mode and if you want help on the missions you must read through 4 long pages of text with useless pics.... I recommend the Nintendo guide over Prima's for this game."
5,jack the lad,Easy to listen to. Nice voice. Shame he isnt around to do a few more nice covers. Deserved more airplay than he gets
3,Not for a pre-teen,"I've read another Sarah Dessen book before, recently. It wasn't have bad, so I thought I'd check out this book. Now, when I buy a book I usually pass it on to someone. Sometimes I will have my daughter read it or pass it on to my coworkers. My daughter is a mature 12 year old, but sheltered. So with the under-aged drinking, sex, bars and such; I would not pass this one on to my daughter. Buyer beware."
4,This Lullaby,"This Lullaby is about a girl named Remy who thinks she has everything about love figured out. She doesn't really believe in anything serious. It all started out with her mom & dad's relationship. Her dad is a musician. He wrote a song for her when she was borned called This Lullaby. Remy is sure she'll never be with any musician. Then comes along a boy named Dexter who changes that. They're close to being opposites, but they become close. Dexter's in a band who travels to different places, trying to become known. In the end, he leaves.I liked this book. I read it because I enjoyed Sarah Dessen's other book I had read a lot. She's a great writer. I would recommend this book. It's easy to pay attention to, easy to understand. Remy goes through a lot of life experience. It can teach you a lot. She's a character who's really easy to relate to because she's very down to earth. Overall, I would give this book a great review. It's one of my favorites."
2,For a Sarah Dessen book...I was extremely disappointed...,"I've read many of Sarah Dessen's books, but this book just could not hold my attention. Remy's attitude may have done it for me, or maybe I didn't feel like the plot picked up quickly enough.I didn't finish the book, but I read about half way before calling it quits. It's very rare that I put down a book, much less quit reading it all together, so I was rather shocked. I didn't think that this book was anything like the rest of her books - Along for the Ride, Just Listen, Lock and Key, etc. - so maybe that's why I found myself disappointed. I'm honestly not sure.I think that things with Remy and Dexter kind of happened too fast without much explanation, and also that a lot of what happened was extremely predictable. Overall, I just feel like Sarah Dessen left many holes in the plot, or lack there of one...but then again, maybe it's just me."
5,"unique, worth picking up","From the first page, I was wrapped up in the life of Remy, recent high school grad ready to move on with life. Dessen writes it so clearly that as you read, the scenery, characters, and dialouge seem to be in front of you. The book is a quick read and worth while picking up. From the parrallel life of the character in Remys' mothers most recent romance novel to the stereotypical beauty salon where Remy works, each page is filled with bright discription and humor."
3,Too vulgar for VA,"This was an engrossing love story, with deep, interesting characters, but why all the bad language, sex, drugs, and drinking? It was too much. I can't believe this is recommended for children age 12 and up. The vulgarity classifies this book as adult fiction."
3,typical teenager,"i thought that this book was okay but highly unoriginial. the girl was a slut, and a loser and i guess just your average teenager today this book lacked an interesting plot"
2,this lullaby,i order this product at least a month ago and still haven't got it yet. mostlikely won't buy from these people again
5,This Lullaby,This book was really great I reccommend this book to anyone who like books about teen love.
2,if you're a teen girl,"....you'll like it. It's about love, journeys, *sigh* going to college. It has lovable characters, a nice tame plot. If your standards for reading are higher; however, skip this read. it's not that original and won't keep you hooked. if you still like the romance stuff, go for francesca lia block instead. if you like the whole teenage journey thing, read White Oleander. but this one isn't worth buying."
2,KINDA [Not Good],"This book is really funny. I don't think it's suited for anyone younger than 16, considering that there's a lot of underaged drinking and an assumtion is made that most dating involves sex. A senior in high school or college student could relate to this book. I have to admit, it's a little boring sometimes and hard to get through: you're waiting for something to happen and it doesn't, sorry. I think that there's a lack of plot also. They say in English class that every book has a problem, but I don't see it with this book. Some of it is a little unrealistic. The humor is the best aspect. Besides all its downfalls, this book is great! (COUGH, COUGH)"
2,Dexter was the best part,"Dexter is a fantastic character. He leapt off the page and made me laugh out loud more than once. I absolutely loved him, and he's the reason for the second star.Unfortunately, this was the only good part of the book. The storyline was predictable, and the language was confusing. I had to re-read several paragraphs to figure out what the author was trying to say, and a few times I never did figure it out.Aside from Dexter and Remy, the characters seemed flat and lifeless. The mom had some character development, but it was predictable and not very well done. This story could have been great, but fizzled instead. Very disappointing."
4,Good in a good way,"I am pretty sure this is the first 'romance' novel that I have ever read. Although the story is typical... dorky-boy-makes-pretty-girl-fall-for-him-by-being-persistent... it is not boring. Though the plot is predictable, the writing is fun and the author captures the attitudes of the characters very precisely.I liked this book because I could relate to Remy, the main character, who has all but given up on finding true and lasting love. Remy is cynical having seen her mother marry 5 different men. I like Remy's no-nonsense attitude although some would say she is a b*tch.As for cheesy teenage love stories,( have only read this one), I would say it is a good book. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a light, fun read."
3,Remy = Bad,"I think the author had a good idea with this book but it was really hard to read the book when you dislike the main character so much, Remy was an awful person and a terrible example to all the teenage girls reading it, drinking bear and getting drunk under the age of 21 and have sex with multiple guys that she dumps heartlessly... Also I didn't like Dexter very much I just imagined him as this filthy stalker band geek, the author didn't present him in a way that made him mysterious and something worth going after for Remy. THat being said though I think the book had an overall good story line and it was very creative."
5,This Lullaby,This Lullaby was a great book! The characters were so relateable. It wasn't as good as some of her other books but still awesome. The characters appear in Just Listen which I think is super cool. The summary you get on the back of the book is kind of misleading and I really didn't like the main character as much as a reader should. Buy and enjoy:)
3,Not One of My Faves,"I love Sarah Dessen books, but This Lullaby was tough to get through. Most of Dessen's books are upbeat, but this one was dark because the main character, Remy, is so cynical about love. It's not a normal cynical either...it's pretty intense. It was also just kind of...bland, maybe? I'm sorry Sarah Dessen, but this was not one of my favorites by you.For more on This Lullaby, and other great books, visit my blog at http://unrequiredreading-c.blogspot.comHappy Reading! Carrie"
3,On the fence,"On one hand, I did enjoy certain parts of this book, for example ""Hate Spinnerbait"" is forever lodged in my brain. On the other hand, I couldn't really feel the connection between Remy and Dexter and for some reason throughout the entire book I kept thinking how he deserves better. Not that Remy wasn't a likeably enough character, it's just that he always seemed so sincere and she never had her heart in it.To sum up: After reading the book, I was left with kind of a blah feeling, but upon further review I keep going back to the funny momments and they make me feel that I didn't waste the time reading it."
3,Okay.,"Sarah Dessen is one of my favorite authors, and i usually cant put her books down. In this book, I loved the first couple chapters, but towards the end, it seemed to really drag on. Which is very surprising for her books."
4,great,I liked that remey was her own person. I did not like that the romance just ended with no conclusion.
3,Good in the beginning,"Most books start off slow in the beginning and get good in the end, but I thought the total opposite with this book. It had such a great start and then just got sort of slow in the end. This was the first book i read by the author and I will probably read mroe because I heard some of them were great, but I was not fully impressed with this book."
5,'This Lullaby' Shines,"I started out This Lullaby with low expectations. It wasn't my style and after finishing That Summer, Dreamland, Someone Like You, and Keeping the Moon, I didn't think it could possibly measure up. But alas, Sarah Dessen has proved once more that every book is a winner. This Lullaby deals with Remy and her strong feelings about her dad leaving and the popular song he dedicated to her. With her brother falling deeper in love with his obsessive compulsive girlfriend Jennifer Anne and her mom getting married for the umpteenth time, Remy is more cynical about love than ever. But when she meets Dexter, a funny and hapless romantic, she has to choose between playing it safe, and finally taking a risk. I thought the story was beautiful with lots of romance and humor. I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves love."
2,So Yesterday (..Pre-teens ONLY),"A little too 12-year-oldish for me. I usually love young adult books but the challenges and the story seemed meant for pre-teens. I was bored. The whole ""I don't believe in love"" plot is lame. The characters were dull and superficial. Lacked depth. I didn't finish it."
5,This lullaby,"the book was fantastic. it kept me on my feet the whole way through. the characters are fantastic. they resemble most teenagers these days. Sarah Dessen portrays the very nicely. you always know what they are thinking, or you are wondering what they are thinking. everything in this book is just fantastic. the plot was amazing. i couldn't help but wonder how it was going to turn out for the characters. i loved it."
5,"Amazing work, Dessen!","This book was probably one of my all time favorites. I usually don't read a lot of fiction books, but this book was amazing. I'd highly recommend this great page-turner. Almost all the chapters ended with a secret of Remy's, so you wouldn't want to put the book down. You won't want to put the book down! This book is most enjoyable to teenagers because many of the things the characters are going through can relate to their life."
5,This Lullaby,THIS BOOK IS THE BEST EVER! IT'S FUNNY BUT AT THE SAME TIME SWEET AND ROMANTIC! 5 OUT OF 5! READ IT FOR SURE!
3,Jaded girl meets Goofy boy,"Remy is a jaded girl with a hardened heart while Dexter is a lead singer trying to open her to love. Dexter and his bandmates are all hilarious. As a reader, you can't help but love Dexter and hope that he wins Remy's heart."
5,totally awesome book,"I loved this book, and I don't care for a lot of real-life type stories. I'm much more into fantasy and science fiction, but this book is definitely one of my all time favorites. I've lent it to several of my friends and they all loved it. A quick overview: ""Remy -an obsessive control-freak, to put it bluntly- has always had a very narrow-minded view on love and relationships because of her mother, who's been married five times and and none of them lasted. Then she meets Dexter, who is really not the type of guy she usually goes for, and everything she thought she knew is turned on its head."" It's a great story, I loved it, and I would recommend it to all girls over 15, or maybe a little younger. There's some language and stuff in it, which I don't really mind but some people might. If you get the chance, you have to read this book. Enjoy!! :-)"
4,Another Wonderful Book by Dessen!,"I love Sarah Dessen's books, I love how real her writing and characters are. I love how I know when I pick up one of her books I am going to be swept into a real life situation with problems and ordeals that could happen to anyone and be anyone's life.I picked up this book because after reading the synopsis I realized that this time those real life situations were something that I could relate to in certain ways.This is a very heartfelt read about finding your way in life, growing up, believeing in the impossible and jumping in, sometimes head first."
5,my favorite book,"When I first found out about Sarah Dessen it was a complete accident but the best accident of my life. Since the first book she captured my heart in her story life. She brought a whole new view on young adult relationships. I have read approximately all her books leaving me two or three. My favorite has been this one; This Lullaby. When I read the back it seemed like it had a good plot, never did I think it would have been my favorite. Remy a cold girl living a life filled with neglect and anger meets a boy who is filled with happiness and has a bubbly personality. She initially finds him absolutely annoying where he is internally attracted to her. The entire story is how their relationship grows. She takes this story and makes it seem like a whole other plot. She adds many twists and an unexpected ending. She has always kept me up late nights reading her books knowing I have an eight am class the next morning."
4,You do Need Love,"Remy is a girl who goes through lots of boyfriends. There's always two to three weeks of fun, then they are out the door, and she's moved on. Then finally she finds someone who doesn't fit any of her priorities, but she still falls for him. She just thinks this relationship will last over summer, but he has different ideas.The main character grabbed my attention from the beginning. Remy reminded me a lot of my own self. Even though she reminded me of myself I still had dislikes about her. I disliked how she didn't think she needed any love from anyone in her life. I did like how she didn't deal with drama in her life, which is the way I try to live my own."
4,Stalked by the village idiot,"I threw this book in the trash once, when I was about 1/3 way through. Then later fished it out.Apparently lots of readers loved Dexter. I hated him until about the end of the book. I found it scary and infuriating that this village idiot was stalking Remy and she didn't seem to be able to stop him.Eventually, I realized that she was quite capable of getting a restraining order and then having him arrested when, inevitably, the moron violated it. In fact, she was quite capable of giving him ""the speech"" in a way that even he would understand.So, obviously some part of her realized that she needed him, just as he desperately needed her."
4,good book,"it was long and descriptive it was about a chick that fell in love with this dude in a band nad then they broke up but they got back together because remmy, the chick, realized that this was more than a summer romance and that she really loved this dude so then she went to stanford and they rote letters to each other..."
2,i was disappointed,"the synopsis of the story at first spiked my interest. however, my opinion of it got slowly lower, and lower, first with all the drinking, smoking and sex mentioned in the book. but that didn't bother me as much as how BORING it was. the story progressed so slowly, i had to put down the book at almost every chapter to occupy myself with something else more interesting. also, i kept waiting for some good substance to make up for the slow wait, but it never came and though the ending was predictable, it was extremely dissatisfying. overall, slow and boring, though i do have to say Dexter was my favorite character, i liked his personality very much."
2,Descent into where exactly?,"I don't even remember how I found out about this movie but I ended up looking it up several times and really wanted to see it. When I finally did, I felt like I wasted my money. It is one of those movies where the trailer gives away the whole thing. The only things the trailer left out were the two rape scenes, which after you see them you wish you hadn't. The movie leaves you with a very unsure ending and you feel conflicted, which I don't like when you can't really like any one in a movie. The way it is filmed is not attractive to the eye whatsoever and there is little dialouge that is of actual importance. Honestly, I was just waiting for it to be over, thanfully it's not that long. If you want to see it just out of curiosity go right ahead, just don't expect anything spectacular."
3,Trashy and boring but . . .,Every boy in college should be made to watch this to the end! The ending will stay with them forever. I know it will me!
2,Disappointed at Unusable Dosage Charts,"The book's dosage charts for children don't work in the context of the book. The book instructs you to determine the child dosage based on adult dosage, yet the book neglects to tell you the actual adult dosages for many of the recipes throughout, so that you can't make this determination. Occasionally, the book does recommend an actual child dosage rather than directing you to the ""dosage charts"" without sufficient information.Otherwise, the book seems easy to follow and can be entertaining."
2,Review Herbal Remedies for Children's Health,I would not suggest this book to any Christian because it is not Christian based. She has experience in herbal remedies but for Children remedies I would rather trust someone who has used these remedies specifically for his/her children. I have read the book: The ABC Herbal: A Simplified Guide to Natural Health Care for Children by Steven H Horn and it is more practical and helpful and you can get most of these ingredients in South Africa.
5,I love this C D,It aint cheating if you dont get caught. I love that song im happy that i bought this c d. I searched every where in Los Angeles CA and no one knew who T K Soul was. LOL But i do.
5,"Nice fixture, right price.","I was looking for a contemporary sconce fixture for a while to provide light and yet be simple and elegant. This seagull light is perfect for hallways and areas in which you may view the light from the side, since it wraps around completely to the wall, unlike many sconces.It's a white 'creamy' texture light and comes with both brushed nickel and antique bronze accent screws, which pretty much fit any environment. I use a warm CFL in mine and it provides excellent uplighting and decent diffused light to illuminate an ares."
4,Small sconce good for bathroom or small space,This sconce fit in perfect as a light on the side of my vanity. I couldn't install a light on top of the mirror so i need a sconce that looked good by itself on the side wall. This did the job.
3,"Arrived broken, but refunded without hesitation","The package must have been exposed to crushing force during shipping; the cardboard of the outer box showed folding at the edges. The inner box, unfortunately, was not surrounded by shock-absorbent materials. One side was directly against the inner cardboard surface of the outer box. The glass of the sconce was shattered. Otherwise, the fixture parts seemed of good quality and easy to install. When I reported the damage, the full charge was reversed without any further effort on my part. I did not seek a re-shipment because I could not delay the project any longer and resorted to a local source."
1,stereo receiver,"Did not work! I have to take it to a Sony certified dealer for repair. I Do Not, recomend this product! My choices are: Return for refund and reorder( 2 weeks at least turn around). Pay shipping to Sony Mfg`r in Texas for repair ( 2-3 weeks turn around). Take this to a Sony certified dealer here in Phoenix,AZ. (there are only 2!)leave it for repairs, and then go pick it up after ( how many days no one knows). All, at my expense! I am NOT, a happy camper. Amazon should make recompense to me, I feel"
1,Horrible crackling noise,"I bought one of these, it has a bad audio ""crackling"" noise on every mode except FM tuner (an obvious defect). Sounds like a capacitor going bad, not sure how it got through final test.Plus, the audio has noise when the display updates or the volume is changed. It also hangs on to stereo mode on weak signals with no blend or rolloff, you hear audio tones from the stereo decoder PLL losing lock from the station 19 KHz pilot tone. AM section is not bad, but the FM selectivity is not good enough to block alternate stations that most of my other radios deal with just fine. Volume steps are so small it takes forever to change, needs a flippin' crank on the knob.Don't buy this steaming turd.....buy a no-name China box, then you can throw it away when it claps out without feeling like you got scammed."
1,Very Unhappy With My Purchase,"I purchased this AM/FM receiver because: I needed to replace a copy of this very same model - purchased approximately five years ago. I was looking forward to another five years of service (from my receiver), but sadly I didn't even get one day from it. I found out that it was a ""lemon"" as soon as I took it out of the box. The only good thing I can say about my purchase of this Sony receiver (from Amazon.com) is the fact that Amazon.com was very helpful in my effort to return it, and was very prompt in crediting my credit card: once they received the item I sent back to them. I ended up purchasing the very same model from Best Buy - at a higher price."
2,Better replacement,"I had this amp for 2 years and replaced it very recently with the Onkyo 9555. The Onkyo is 500$, but what a world of difference. If you really want great sound spend the extra money and get the Onkyo amp! I would not recommend this amp. The only thing going for it is that it's cheap."
4,Sony receiver,"Great product, I heard Sony is not what it used to be but this receiver has some crisp sound . And most important to me it has no audible distortion whatsoever, unlike Pyle receivers which I highly recommend to stay away from."
4,Good Value,"I had a small budget, so after lots of Internet research chose this Sony receiver. I'm very happy with what I got for what I paid. It's got enough power for any sane listening levels, receives radio stations well, and is devoid of lots of bells and whistles. My only complaint would be not enough fine tuning of bass and treble."
5,An Excellent Value!,"This was part of my Stereo update. I selected this receiver for quality, value and ease of operation. I matched it up with the Sony CDPCX355 300 CD player and a fresh pair of those Bose 301-V speakers. Years ago I used to be an audiophile and I now think I'm going to enjoy getting back into my hobby."
4,My opinion,"This amp replaces a top of the line, made in japan w/built in equalizer, hi power, digital display, amplifier. The first thing a buyer needs to do is identify their needs. Don't over buy just for looks or unused power output. This amp is a great buy for the money. I picked it up at BEST BUY, open box for $99.99. I'm 100% satisfied with the sound and performance. The bass is better then my old unit. Buy it, try it, if it doesn't suit your needs, return it."
2,Not good,"Everything was fine till i connected the FM antenna. Then everything got static- the mp3 player, cd player. more evidence that sony isn't near the quality it used to be."
2,"Would love to review this, but I can't seem to have it delivered","When this item arrived, it did not work. None of the buttons on the front worked, tuner did not work, volume control did not work. I returned it for an exchange and it's been about 2 weeks and I've heard nothing back. Hopefully it eventually arrives. Hopefully it works."
1,Perhaps our unit was defective,"We returned this receiver. Once it was hooked up, we found that the volume control did not work well. The volume increased only a smidge even when it was turned up all the way. All we were looking for was a simple receiver that worked well, and this was not it. We were disappointed because we've found Sony products to be very reliable, usually."
4,Sony Tuner,"Wanted a reasonably priced receiver, mostly to get speaker-quality sound for sat TV and DVD player. Fills the need well. Pretty easy to set up, easy to use with remote, good sound quality."
3,Adequate upon first impressions,"I bought one of these today, and it's quite adequate. My old Vector Research hybrid (solid state + analogue) sounded sweeter, but the Sony STR-DE197 does a fine job for what it costs. I'm pushing 3 ways by Linear Dynamics, and these are very sweet for acoustic intruments such as piano, horns, and strings. I had to beef up the bass to +4 and treble to +6, then hit the bass boost button to match my old receiver amplifier. This comes close to the performance of my old receiver and I'm satisfied. One thing is outstanding -- the tuner. This baby tunes FM exceptionally well. It's clear and free from all harmonic spurs and extraneous content. The only question now is how long will the unit last. Time will tell. But first impressions are satisfactory. For the price, this unit delivers very well."
1,[...] Pass the Torch,"First of all the advertised power(100 watts per channel) is nowhere close to what it actually puts out (sounds like about 30-35 to me). Secondly theres no phono inputs nor is there a tape monitor to hook up things like EQ's. So who is this piece of scrap metal actually aimed at? Most of us who are inclined to buy 2 channel recievers probably have a turntable and or EQ. It's way over priced , it would suffice I suppose as a reciever for your garage but then I suspect any 50 dollar boombox would sound as good and probably do more and you'd get a CD player to boot. Avoid this thing like the plague. If your so inclined pick up the Onkyo 8511 which is only priced at about 80-100 dollars more but is light years ahead of this."
3,"A Year Later, A Bit Worse","They added some plays, gave you some more team-management options, but gave us worse graphics and gameplay. It is still fun, but frankly I have to recommend Blitz 2000 over this newer version. A bit of a disappointment."
3,It's suppose to be better,"I was happy with the game except that the graphics are worse than NFL Blitz 2000! I thought that the graphics and everything were supposed to get better as the newer games came along. The graphics are somewhat choppy and get a little annoying when it isn't moving smoothly. Hopefully, NFL Blitz 2002 will be better than the last."
5,Still a blast in 2012,"I recently picked up a few copies for less than 50 cents each, I had to get it because I loved it as a kid. The gameplay is ridiculous, definitely has it's flaws, and at most you'll need about 3-6 plays in your playbook to get through a game or even a season. However, this game is a RIOT with 2-4 players. The more, the better. I've been told that this game is fun while tipsy, while I've never tried it, it sounds interesting. The differences between this particular title and any other before Blitz The League are minimal and relatively skin-deep. Love one, love all.This game is without a doubt, a party game. Fun while played alone, an incomparable blast when played socially. The rules are simple, controls are easy, and the game ridiculous.And please, skip Blitz 2012, it's awful."
1,"So bad, it's almost painful","Did these guys playtest this thing before it left the shop ?1. The graphics are some of the worst I've ever seen. Everything is gritty and jagged. The players are tiny compared to how they used to be.2. The playbook is teeny-tiny now. Almost unreadable3. Load times for the game, and halftimes is unacceptable.4. Slow, slower, slowest. Executing plays is a joke with the players practically crawling across the screen. It's like slow-motion, making it really easy to figure out what the offense is doing.The playlist editor is a nice idea, but because of 1-4, I cannot play this. I'm glad I rented it. And all the guys who play Blitz with me said the same thing ""this is a big letdown"""
2,um.... duh!,OK... why would anyone be so lazy as to play a video game on a sport they can just go out and play any day of the week. Come on.. can you be more lame? Man... how boring. I wish I could kick anyone who buys this stupid game. the two stars are for the spiffy cover art...
5,An exceptional piece of literature,This book allows the parents of thier children to grasp a firm and well understood method of the procees to which raising your children should happen. The seven virtues taught in the book encourages parents to be involved and to guide their children through a walk of Faith with Christ!!!
1,Woeful,"I am a big Paul McCartney fan, and loved Wings. But Denny Laine, a founder of that band does a simply woeful production here.Several songs he simply bores the listener.The only good thing was to hear a song ""Send Me the Heart"" which Wings never released.The 4 ""bonus tracks"" are not Wings songs at all.Then, a friend of mine asked ""Why would Denny want to do a 'tribute' to a band he was in?"" Good question. Seems like he needed a little extra cash - especially when one can also purchase ""Denny Laine: Performs the Hits of Wings"""
4,A Well Done Tribute,"When I purchased this CD, I figured it would be interesting to hear Denny Laine's versions of the Wings songs. I knew it would be pretty good, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well done the songs are. Laine's voice is excellent and he does a very admirable job singing the songs of his legendary former bandmate. The arrangements are excellent, especially Listen to What the Man Said, done with only an acoustic guitar and violin. Other standouts are gorgeous versions of Mull of Kintyre and Blackbird, a rocking Silly Love Songs and Band on the Run, and the obscure Wings songs Deliver Your Children and Children Children. The only down parts of the album are a couple of the bonus tracks and Send Me the Heart, an awful country song.I really enjoy listening to this CD. If you're a McCartney fan, this CD is a must pickup. I HIGHLY recommend it."
2,Oh no....,"I can't *imagine* this release *Not* being embarrassing for Mr. Laine. (& I'm not even talking about the quality of the music yet)The number of cringe-inducing vocal cracks is astounding. It also sounds like it was recorded in his living room.To my ears, everything about this album screams ""My house payments aren't done yet. Please buy this.""Stick to Macca himself & free listens online if you must, but Don't purchase..."
5,simply the best,"What a great bit of kit ... i got this in the hunting department at Walmart but actually use it when doing offshore sailing races. The red LED light is perfect for checking things when you don't want to ruin your night vision, the white LED is there when you need it and the spot light is just enough to check the tell-tales ... would recomend it to anyone who needs both red and white light at night."
5,Better Than Expected,"Although this headlamp got great reviews I never expected such high quality. The lights are very bright, the headband fits well and it feels very well constructed. If Amazon starts restocking this I'll get a few more for gifts. Good job Rayovac."
2,Twists and turns that lead nowhere,"Wasted about 120 minutes on this one. It has some suspense, but ultimately disappointing in the end. Decent leads into a disappointingly bland and mundane ending.I would not watch it again."
5,Fun and stimulating,"Fun, creative, and goes where other journal and activity books don't. It makes kids expand their thinking and use their imaginations with interesting ideas and inspiring illustrations that won't intimidate. A great birthday present."
5,Fires are being set off in the library,"Mary Anne volunteers to work at the Readathon (a contest for the little kids to read books for prizes and to get new books for the library) and then fires start being set off! Mary Anne and the rest of the members of the Baby-sitters Club decide to catch the person setting them off! Not only the BSC but Nicky Pike, BSC member Mallory Pike's brother, is helping too because some matches were found in his jacket pocket and he didn't put them there. So who would set fire to some books and why? Is it the protestors who want to ban some of the books? Is it one of the kids that doesn't want to be in the Readathon? Is it actually Nicky? You have to read the book to find out! I rated it 5 stars because it was well written and pretty fun to read. You probably won't guess who's setting off fires...but you will like the ending!"
5,"""Mary Anne and the Library Mystery""","This was the first and the best BSC book I have ever read. Mary Anne works at the local libary and gets in a mystery of fires in the building. In a brief line, Mary Anne mentions that ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" (aka: ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl"") was a good book. I like the way the author mentions real books. This is the best BSC book for bookworms who love Mary Anne Spier."
1,"Well, at least the name sounds good","My experience with codewarrior hasn't been good at all, to say the least. Their so-called standard C++ Refrence Lib has bugs that cripple any programs I've tried to write using it, and their plentiful on-CD documentation could offer no assistance or guidance. If you're in the market for a compiler, my personal advice is to go with Borland, if you don't want your life and production pipeline needlessly complicated. However, I cannot speak for any other languages it supports."
5,"Guitar/Piano scoring, Excellent printing, good selection","This book is written in standard Guitar/Piano format, where each line of music includes piano scores as well as guitar chord boxes (dots, no finger numbers) on top of the melody line. The 10 songs included in the selection are from 4 different albums, and copies of the album covers preceed the songs selected from that album. The printing is excellent, with a font that's good sized and easy on the eyes. There are generally four lines of music to a page. All the lyrics appear with the lines of music, making this an easy read for the beginner or memory impaired older player like myself. The songs are: Take It Easy, Witchy Woman, Lyin Eyes, Already Gone, Desperado, One of These Nights, Tequila Sunrise, Take It to the Limit, Peaceful Easy Feelin, The Best of my love. Overall, I found this to be an excellent book with a very good selection of popular Eagles tunes."
2,Not what we expected,"I was hoping this book of love poems might be a good one for my young adult (teen) daughter. She wasn't convinced, and neither am I. Lines like 'there was laughter, like ripples around a stone.' And 'I am tasting your mouth - not food. I am drinking your eyes - not wine.' .....seem prosaic to say the least, and not, somehow, what young adults want to read. And in the middle of meeting and falling in love, there is an accident. All of a sudden he's distant. Why? Well we never learn why. It's kind of just tucked in the middle and left there. Some of the poems toward the end are better. 'August' is something every girl can relate to. But many of the poems miss the mark"
2,Disappointing,"I was interested in finding more techniques. The bulk of the book was about Atlantis, if I wanted to read about Atlantis I wouldn't have bought this book. Atlantis has more to deal with crystals then angels and it is mostly an autobiography with some thoughts in the back on how to do things. Some of the correspondences to the angels aren't what I'm used to and feels distinctly off. If your interested in Atlantis I'd say go for it, otherwise don't bother, there are other resources out there."
5,"""Angel Medicine""",Doreen Virtue takes you on a wonderful informative journey. I felt like I was in Greece with her.The information about healing with the help of the Angels is outstanding.
4,Python Stikes Again,"Once again, the crew from Monty Python has produced an entertaining, yet mindless game fro the gamer who is fed up woth action games. From ""spotting the looney"" to blowing up bushes, this game has it all."
2,No Ownership,"I am a long-time Al Jarreau fanatic. Even my kids (11,13,16) know most of his songs because they hear them so much. I was terribly disappointed with this CD. When an artist covers a tune, I expect them to make it their own, give it their own flavor. It didn't happen on this CD. Al simply re-recorded the same arrangements as the original artist. It's the only Al Jarreau CD or album that I never reach for. Dull, plodding and doesn't showcase his vocal skills or style at all.Disappointed Pam in Illinois"
4,Great speakers,"The SL80s are nice speakers. They rival the separates I used to have. They are a little bright sounding, so you'll need a sub if you want a balanced sound from your vehicle's audio system. They go perfect with my 8"" JL sub!"
5,Lincoln: Speeches and Writings Volume 2,"A must-have and must-read book for all fans of Abraham Lincoln. The collection of writings and speeches from one of the greatest political figures in our history still resound with vibrance and brilliancy well over a hundred years after being penned.Lincoln's greatness as a good man and his legacy as an astute, capable, and at times, shrewd politician is so well preserved by his writings. This book satisfies both that well-deserved reputation and his legacy as both an orator and author."
3,A Good First Hand Account,"I wish all vet's would write a similar book. A first hand account of the personal recollections of wartime service of the average enlisted man, a paratrooper no less! You'll find a lot of great little gems in here you might not get in a traditional history. It only suffers from a lack of photos and additional background on the Heroes that the men of the 509th were. Well worth the price, you wont be able to put it down untill your done."
5,Adorable and Engrossing!,I read this to my 7th grade math students and they loved it. They picked up on all of the concepts and play on words and even related the book to a lesson we were doing on a different day. Can't wait to purchase the rest of them.
5,Great Teaching Tool,"Used this when teaching 4th graders. They kept getting confused between which measurement was radius, circumference, and diameter. This book solved that problem! Great great book for teaching!!!"
5,Sir Cumference and the First Round Table: A Math Adventure,Very cute story and a nice way of using word play to describe geometric vocabulary. Great for an introduction to the concept and as a review for older children.
2,Sir Cumference and the First Round Table,"This little book appeared to be very clever and well illustrated, however the quality, colors and illustrations were not what I had expected."
3,enjoyable,"I'm not a connoiseur of children's literature. But I will be teaching high school math in about a year and used this book for a math methods class. I enjoyed the humor and the art. The reading level is about 4th grade and so is the math content. Most of the book illustrates in a amusing way just how circles are different from other geometric shapes and how these differences affect the design of everyday objects. The book ends by tying the definition of circumference, radius and diameter to the names and actions of the main characters in the story.However, the story line is marred by a certain tedious political correctness in that the outsiders who appear to threaten the realm are not really a threat - it's all a misunderstanding. This hollows out the content of the ideal of the knight (or soldier or policeman), a hero who employs his strength at the risk of his own life to defend the more vulnerable members of the community from villains and the community itself from outside threats."
5,This is a great book!!!,"I love this book because it has such a great way of explaining about circumfrences, diameters, and radiuses. It's so easy to unterstand that I learned in Kindergarten or 1st grade what I would have learned in 4th. Definitly worth it."
2,Lame. Not worth your money.,"My amazon record shows that I actually bought this book. I had forgotten, and 'returned' it to the public library, which is where I wish I'd gotten it to begin with. The story is strained and not very informative. Great math books worth buying to read to your child include Math Trek, Math Trek 2, G is for Google, and especially, the Number Devil - reading great math books has been wonderful fun for my family - but not Sir Cumference."
4,awsome knife but..,"It was a awsome knife, very well built very nice feel, there was no real downside to it really.Would be perfect except it was a downside for me because i use my knife for work and this wont cut it, its too thin and not heavy duty at all, witch is actually my fault for buying it.I returned it after talking to amazon customer support and they were very helpful, id reccomend this to anyone who wants a nice light sleek nice edc blade, but dont plan to use it for hard work or it wont cut it."
4,Love this knife,This knife was given out as a safety award in my shop a few years ago and most everyone got one. Most still have them. I lost mine shortly after getting mine and have been upset about it since then. I was online a few days ago and decided to order one for myself. The version that was given out as an award was the full stainless steel version of the handle and it has stood the test of time within our shop. It resharpens easily and stays sharp for a good long time. The version that I got this time has the anodized handle in blue and black and is slightly lighter than the full stainless one. It's already made a few of the other guys jealous of this one. I'm looking forward to a good long term use of this knife and would recommend this as a good utilitarian knife for everyday use to anyone.
5,Best Pocket Knife Ever,"This has to be the best pocket knife ever. Starting with the size, it fits most any pocket without bulkiness. The low profile clip does the job without adding much to it's already slim profile. The single hand trigger opening is what sets this knife apart from all the rest. It is fast and effortless. The blade is extremely sharp and durable. If I lost this knife today, I'd buy another one today."
3,Regular Woofer,It is a regular woofer. it's not very good to perform your soun car. it's a woofer intermediate for low prices.
3,A good overall OEM replacement for your speakers.,"Got this to replace the 8"" woofer in my stand alone audio tower at home. I have 8 8 inch woofers in the tower. I added this to replace the punched out speaker that my son did. It functions and does it duties all right. This speaker couldn't and didn't sound at all like my polk audio in the cabinet.I did notice that the woofer does not like high db levels from my amp. It was listed as a professional premium pa woofer at 8 ohms, but sounded like it wasn't meant to be pushed too far.I would only buy this to replace a speaker that you can't find to replace your stock ones. I ended up buying some other 8"" woofers from another vendor. For now I will use this one until I blow it out!"
4,Great way to start Writer's Workshop!,This book is an excellent tool for anyone trying to implement a writer's workshop in their classroom. It takes you through step by step and provides many lessons and reproducibles that make sense. Definately a MUST HAVE for someone just starting a new program or for anyone that just needs a quick refresher course!
4,ghost rider as he should be,while i've never read comics on my computer before i loved this dvd. every ghost rider comic from when i was growing up and reading the series on a $13 dvd. this provided me weeks of reading material. danny ketch's ghost rider is so much cooler than the first one and with all the other characters and spirits of vengeance all here it was great to finish the stories i didn't get to as a kid. much less expensive than trying to track down all the comics. the one drawback is that there are several crossover series that are in these story lines and so some of them you only get half the story. thats the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
4,Fun Swing,"Too early to evaluate durability, but appears to be solid and well designed. Easy to install and already loads of fun for my 7 year old."
2,poorly constructed,"This swing is pretty (when brand new) and tons of fun. Unfortunately the fun only lasted a month at my house before the swing started to fall apart. Then last night the top part of the swing seperated from the bottom part, making the swing unusable. (so in less then two months I will need to replace the swing, but the warrently is only good for one month). I thought that the swing was a solid piece of wood, but it appears that it is some type of pressed wood. It has been raining where I live, so it is most likely only a problem in areas that recieve rain.... The remainder of the world, that does not get rain should be fine....."
2,jack,Not sure I like it because it is plywood. I thought it would be of of good durable plastic. So we will see. It is still questionable.I am a little worried if my grandchildren fly high on it!
2,Ladybug tree swing,This tree swing faded quickly in the sun. It also tends to splinter over time. I cannot recommend it.
3,Looks nice,"If you have this swing in a garden setting it is great. Don't let it hit a wall or floor, it will chip away. Holds a lot of weight and swing great."
5,Fun for hours!,"We were considering getting a small swing set for our 4 year old and 2 year old children, but decided that it would take up too much space so I bought this swing as a birthday gift for my daughter instead. She LOVES it! She swings for a long time on it. It was very easy to hang in our apple tree. It takes a little getting used to and she has fallen a couple of times, but otherwise this was a great gift! The 2 year old is afraid to try it, so maybe in a year or two for him!"
5,So simple yet so much fun,"This ladybug swing is great. The kids love it because they can spin around as well as go back and forth. It is a sturdy, solid wood which is a nice break from the other plastic backyard toys. It was easy to hang and the length of rope was perfect for our tree. Plus, it is a pretty ladybug which isn't necessary for fun but is an added bonus :-)"
2,Ladybug Swing,This Swing is not very durable. rope snapped after about 10 months. also the seat faded in the sun after the first week and looked terrible.
4,Ladybug Tree Swing,"I ordered the Sassaras Ladybug Tree Swing for my grandchildren ages 2, 3, and 7. It's a really cute ladybug design and looks good in our front yard. But I have one suggestion that the rope could be a little longer. The recommendations state that the seat should be no higher than 2 feet from the ground. Right now it's 2 feet and a couple inches. If the rope was just a little longer and adjustable it would be better for the little guys."
1,Horrible Swing,"This product is awful - do not buy it. We had it outside for less than 3 months and the seat is faded, the paint chipped and the wood has separated on one side to the point where it is a safety hazard (splinters in legs and rear area). I usually do not write reviews like this, but this product is NOT WORTH the money you pay for it! Awful product overall!!!"
2,Not very durable,"I bought this for my kids in the beginning of summer. My kids loved it as well as our neighbor's kids. Unfortunately, after a few weeks of being exposed to summer rainfall, the seat began to peel off and there were splinters all over making if dangerous for kids to sit on it. It's a cute and fun swing but if you get it, you'd have to protect it. It's not made to be left outside all summer long."
1,DEFECTIVE JUNK!,"Purchased this swing for my 5yo niece's birthday in May.. By August the swing was peeling apart, splintering everywhere - making it a hazard for my nieces! It's not real wood - it's pressed and it's not treated properly for the outdoors. Amazon.com has done an amazing job taking care of us... but save your money! This manufacturer dropped the ball on making this toy."
3,An oldie but goodie. . .,"The kindest thing to say about this edition is that it is classic and cheap. If you're serious about writing, you'd probably do better to purchase a more recent edition. English is dynamic. Acceptable usage changes. Yes, there are some rules that have persisted. And, you could do worse in choosing your writing style. But, the time you invest in improving your command of the written language represents the greater cost. Spending a few dollars on an up-to-date style manual adds value to that investment far in excess of the cost of the book."
4,Old school sophistication,This is a great book. I keep it by my bedside and anywhere else a thought or question about grammar might arise. A glossary for some definitions would be helpful.
5,Classic Book to Improve Your Writing,The Elements of Style is a must have for all who wish to improve their writing. The essentials of great writing are set out clearly and concisely in this awesome book. This book can help everyone write better in all topics. The Elements of Style gets my two thumbs up!
1,"Not The Real ""Elements of Style""","This is a public domain version of an old 1919 copy of a grammar text by William Strunk Jr. It is not useful. Writing standards are different in 2011 compared with 1919.""The Elements of Style (4th Edition)"" by William Strunk (Author), E. B. White (Author), Roger Angell (Foreword) is what you want to buy."
1,Buy the Paper Copy (4th edition),"I'm a huge fan of Strunk and White's ""Elements of Style,"" however, this is not the Strunk and White edition. This is simply a digitized-for-Kindle version of the original (Strunk only) edition.There's a reason that college classes across the country use the Strunk and White edition--it is simply better."
5,Excellent,"This book is very concise, but it contains the necessary information for your writing to be polished."
2,It is the first version!,"It is the first version, but reprinted. If you like the fourth version or later, review the product description before you click the ""order"" button."
2,O...K.,"Okay, so I paid like $3 for this book. What did I expect.Super thin, extremely brief and almost common knowledge? I don't know what I expected but I was still disappointed."
3,Elements of Style,I was expecting the longer version ...my fault for not reading description carefully. But it looked like it included a spelling section not in the version that E.B. White contributed to. Elements of Style by Strunk and White is a fantastic writing handbook - 5 stars - very readable and slyly funny. I think the artistic touches (and great metaphors about the writing process) must have been from White.So this one is disappointing in its brevity.
3,"Good summary of grammar rules; however, feels dated and is easily substituted by a good English language education","Summary: I wouldn't suggest buying this book. You're better off Googling grammar rules as you get suspicious about your writing.Pro: Good summary of rules, with examples. I think the world would be a better place if everyone followed some rules: e.g., commas for dependent clauses, clarity on a statement's subject.Con: Some rules feel dated. They cover (1) rules that nobody breaks today or (2) wrong rules. An example of a wrong rule is suggesting that ""We read a book, and trusting all of its rules, we made mistakes"" is correct, while ""We read a book and, trusting all of its rules, we made mistakes"" is wrong (note comma's position). Language is a fluid organism; using an early-20th-century book today poses a risk to your style.Suggestion: stick to this: [...] . When in doubt, Google it."
5,Great guide,It's so wonderful that they have recompiled the original edition! It is so much fun to compare the old and new!
3,A Brief Guideline of Writing Fundamentals,"The Elements of Style is concise, direct, and comprehensive in its treatment of the rules of apposite writing. The book includes an overview of conventional rules; commas, conjunctions, independent clauses, and proper sentence and paragraph forms.As a reference, The Elements of Style has value; however, the book looses appeal by invoking extremes of language and punctuation to present the material. Equal effort is required to interpret the material as there is to understand the lessons themselves. I believe one might be better served searching for a more lucid presentation of rules and usages of writing than is provided in this book."
4,Good,"Very good read, very interesting points. I enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning a little more about everything."
4,Required Reading for Writers,I've read several books lately by best-selling authors who should have read this book. It would have helped them immensely.
5,The Digging Bone Rocks,"I have only recently (in the past year) discovered the Richardsons. After listening to a few downloaded songs, I was fortunate enough to see them live. I immediately became a devotee and acquired all of their albums. (Thanks, Amazon!)Of all of the Brother recordings, The Digging Bone is my most favorite. There is plenty of bagpipes and the didgeridoo. There is also plenty of good rock and roll. What I really appreciate with this particular album, is the imagery painted by the lyrics. You can almost ""see"" these tunes. ""The Blackest of Blue"" leads it off and hooked me from the first chord. Shadow Man and Rainmaker are Aussie storytelling at its best!! If you're only going to buy one Brother album (say it ain't so!)this is the one to get IMHO."
4,An excellent sound formed from celtic music and rock.,"This record is one of my favorites, I discovered Brother at a local Scotish festival. But, I would not classify them into the Celtic genre. There are only hints of bagpipes at the start of a few of their songs, but the bagpipes blend beatifully with their style of rock. Their rock is medium, with some hints of heavy rock. The guitar and drum work is great, and the lead singer's voice is good. The lyrics are also very good. Almost all of the songs on this CD are good and will stay in your head for days afterwards."
1,Mind-numbing,"This album is awful! Latterman's debut recording is 10 tracks of mind-numbing HWM/Against Me-derivative pop-punk with droning dual vocals and goofy lyrics about ""staying positive"". While the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th songs feature actual hooks and catchy vocal patterns, the remaining 7 are so goddamn boring and hook-free, it's actually difficult to make a distinction between them, let alone enjoy them as completed pieces.Despite what I said about the discs 3 sunspots, the only track I'd ever consider listening to again is ""There's Never A Reason Not To Party"", which is a great pop song with some interesting guitar work and great vocal patterns. I suggest downloading this track, and leaving the rest. At least it's not as horrible as fellow warriors in unoriginality, the O Pioneers."
1,zero entertainment value,"Unless you're a Chuck Liddell fan that wants to own every DVD he's ever been on, theres no reason to get GFC Las Vegas. The women are far from goregous. The ring attire is ridiculously conservative. And they're so bad at fighting the matches will annoy you(they stop every ten seconds to put their scrunchies back in). This DVD fails on every level."
5,Alosha,"this is a book that you would never want to put down no matter what . Usually when i read a book i won't even bother to read it,i would just read one or two pages and put it down but when i started this book i just couldn't stop reading it i read it for hours . I think everyone should read it.And i am also eagerly looking forward for the next book in the series ""The Shaktra"". i can't wait!"
3,More dumbed down than I'd like.,"Having not read any of Pike's books before, I picked up this book out of the New Books section of my library without any real expectations. If I had known he was a childrens' author, I might have been more forgiving in use of words. But even knowing this now, I feel his use of overly terse sentences and monosyllabic words distracts from the story. Though I'm a decade away from my teen years, I'd guess the writing is closer to a grade school level rather than adult or young adult. It's disappointing when the dialogue that rings most true comes from elemental characters that have trouble putting together full sentences.Don't get me wrong -- I enjoyed the story that was told and will probably read the entire trilogy. It's just that way the story was told could have been much more enjoyable."
3,Disappointed,"When I was a young teen, I adored Christopher Pike's novels. Now I'm 22, and I haven't read a contemporary novel in years, I always read nonfiction or classical literature. I work in a Borders store, and when I saw Alosha in the adult sci-fi section, I had to check it out. I'm sorely disappointed, I had to come online and see if it was really written for adults. Sure, it's an amusing read, I'm tearing through it, but I thought Christopher Pike was much more intelligent when I was 13 myself...My biggest problem with the book at the moment: Ali wants a leather jacket but won't get one because it came off a poor dead cow's back...but in the next paragraph she buys a t-bone for dinner? Ali is supposed to be some kind of nature lover, you'd think she'd know how detrimental the meat industry is to the environment. I was surprised at the beginning when she ordered that turkey sandwich. Sure, she's a 13 year old character, but I just can't get past that."
4,YA Fantasy by Pike?,"Started a little slow, but picks up very steadily. A very well thought out plot and very believable characters."
5,A great book by a great author,"I first saw this book at my library and picked it up mainly because the cover looked very cool. I read the book jacket and was immediatly intrigued. When I finished reading the book, I was so amazed with the story that I couldn't wait for the sequel.I had never read any of Pike's work before, but after reading Alosha I began to devour his books. I now have read almost every single one of his books and have truly enjoyed every one.Also, do not judge this book by its cover... the hardback cover is much cooler looking then the paperback. The hardback cover is what drew me in at first. This is still a great book, the cover is just a lot more impressive on the hardback.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read, and would also urge you to read the sequels. Even if you do not consider yourself a fan of fantasy, I know you will love this book."
2,Book is out of Date,"Much of the information in the book is out-of-date. Especially info about the rivers in the Great Smokies National Park. According to 2 different flyshops in the Cherokee NC area, those rivers have not been stocked for 20 years since the federal hatchery on Bradley Fork was closed."
2,Flakey Cover,"Although the mesh part of this product is comfortable and kept the steering wheel cool, the part with the logo started flaking off after only a few weeks. This is not necessarily unusual for this type of synthetic material. I do love the look, too bad for the quality."
2,IT HAS A NASTY ODOR!!,THE PRODUCT WAS A GIFT AND WHEN THEY RECEIVED IT AND OPENED IT UP THE COVER HAS A VERY UNPLEASANT ODOR. :-(.
5,Looks great,"I wanted to get a steering wheel cover so why not get one with my teams logo on it. It slips on easily, looks great and it's nice not having to touch a supercold steering wheel in the morning!"
5,Simply the best,I just got it....listening to it right now.....This is THE best music ever. My 1st encounter with Kraftwerk was in the early 80's.....i'm so glad that ONE radio station had the guts to spin these records. No kidding i get goose bumps!!!!! Thanks Kraftwerk;-)
3,KW Expo Experiment,"KW testing the water with an 23 minute CD, great vocoder with a DXish sounds of EC. Hypontic riff, echos, need more creative input on percussion."
3,Expo 2000 GER CD,"Abreviated 23 minute CD, repeated theme mix on 4 tracks, great vocoder, simple hypnotic riffs yet need more unique percussive input from these techno masters."
5,I'm updating my tattered copy -,"I used this book extensively when we lived in Rome in the late 1970s. It is for the person who has some time to wander around Rome, not necessarily hitting the major tourist sites. I'm replacing my copy before my next visit - the old one has literally fallen apart with use."
3,"Excellent read, but not a good tourist guide","This book is an excellent read if you want to know about every tourist site in Rome in detail. However, it is much too detailed to serve as a practical tourist guide. This book is useful if you plan on staying in Rome for a year or more, or just wish to know all you can about the city of Rome. For the average tourist, who will probably be in Rome for a week or less, I'd recommend choosing another guide."
3,I suppose it depends what style you like...,"I bought A Companion Guide to Rome by Masson based on 5-star recommendations from Amazon, and for me it was not a worthwhile purchase. The authors (it has been revised several times) offer infinite detail and historical tid bits, but it actually offers little that wasn't already in the Green Guide, and it is too heavy and too much reading in my opinion to do on site, while walking around. It was a nice reference, but I should have looked for it in the library and just borrowed it."
2,good for teachers in the northeast,"I bought this book hoping that it would help me prepare for teaching interviews in a mid-size southern city school system. I found the advice mostly inappropriate for my teaching situation, particularly in terms of dress, formality, and even the path of the application process.I moved down here from the New York metro area, where the author is based and has experience. I think his advice is absolutely spot-on for that market.BUT--not all areas of the country are the same! Take Dr. Pollack's recommendations with a grain of salt if you are not job-searching in the northeast.Good luck in your search!"
5,teacher interviews,"Excellent! Gave sample questions and great material to use when preparing for an interview. Targets different subjects also (a section on science, on math, etc).I would highly recommend it for elementary, middle and high school."
1,Very Disappointed... Career Changer..,"I am very disappointed in this book. Perhaps this book may be good for experienced teachers looking for a new job. I am a career changer and saw reference that prospective teachers such as myself would benefit from this book and bought it based on that information.The couple of references made in regards to career-changers were in the form of sample resumes, which showed the career-changers with ""student teaching"" experience! No example is given for career-changers with unrelated work experience. I think most people would agree that the phrase ""career-changer"" is someone with no teaching experience what-so-ever.I have absolutely no use for this book and feel like I wasted my money. Unfortunately I did not keep my original packaging or I would return it."
2,Didn't really last very long,"I bought this laptop about 18 months ago, and was pretty pleased with it, especially after I upgraded the memory. Unfortunately, just before the laptop's first anniversary with me the WiFi suddenly stopped working. Shortly after that, I began to have trouble getting it to boot. I was just barely within the warranty period, so I shipped it back to HP for service. They were very quick in getting the unit back to me, with a new motherboard installed.Within 4 or 5 months however, the display developed a permanent green vertical line about an inch in from the right edge of the screen. Then one of the USB ports stopped working. Then the other two ports died.It's still usable, as long as you don't need to connect any USB devices, and don't mind the flawed display, but if I had it to do over again, I'd buy something else!"
2,Poor execution,Being in the last year of my accounting degree I've read plenty of textbook and this one is by far the worst I've had to use.Core Concepts contains plenty of information but it is hard to find what you are looking for. Unlike most accounting textbook the text is in small print and the headers don't help direct you to the information your looking for like other accounting books. Its extremely frustrating the amount of time spent looking for information I read the day before when doing homework.
3,.....,Its a cool game being it helps in math etc BUT when you get into the clue cube it is VERY hard to see!! for example if you solve a math problem and get a clue that says the person your looking for has glasses. So you go to the Cube to take out all the people who do not have glasses... it is VERY hard to tell from the little tiny pics who does and who does not have them Lol I think the kids have fun with it BUT I would buy something better next time.
2,"Okay, but","The concept is good, but not on par with the old reader rabbit, and math blaster. Haveing to use the disk every time is a pain, and there doesn't seem to be a way to save where you are. Was looking for summer activities for the grandaughter, don't think this will work. I would not recommend these to todays children. They are far past the graphic capabilities of this system."
1,We love Cluefinders but this one is terrible,"My 10-year-old and I have played (and re-played) all of the Cluefinders games and we find this one boring and frustrating. We call it the Annoying Himalayan game. It forces you to play the same games over and over and some get to be nearly impossible when the levels get higher. Also, a couple of game sequences seem to be flawed. The clues lead you to a suspect and missing treasure and then the game says you are wrong. Also, the same missing treasures are found again and again and some are never found. Unlike the other Cluefinders games where beating one part of the game takes you to a new group of puzzles, this one has a very anti-climactic ending.I recommend any of the other Cluefinders games but not this one."
2,Are you smarter than a 3rd grader?,There are a few puzzles in this game that don't provide enough information to solve. Other puzzles are way too difficult even for my very advanced 9-year-old - they were challenging even for me. I recommend looking elsewhere.
3,Spike & Dru,"I found the writing to be excellent and the story flow to be very compelling. However, I did feel that the illustrations left much to be desired. Very crude drawings with very little artistic appeal. I feel that when one purchases a graphic novel like this, it is as much for the story line as the art work. The stories are wonderful, the art work is very lacking."
4,BVS Spike and Dru,"This was a gift for a friend who had been looking for it for years. Unfortunately it didn't arrive in the best of conditions,Regardless my friend loved it and I will have her give a review of this for all."
1,Sizing is way off.,"According to Amazon and the K'tan website, a medium should have fit me well, and perhaps have been a bit on the small size. Instead, the medium was HUGE and unusable. I returned mine and am too leery of the weird sizing to purchase this in a small. I had really high hopes for this."
4,A must-have for moms,LOVE my K'Tan! It's very handy when I need to be hands-free. And it's easy to get on and get him in and out. The only issue I have is I'm not sure if he's sitting in it quite right. But he seems cozy and falls asleep fast most of the time. I just need to have more patience. I'd totally recommend it.
3,Same as Moby...,"I got this because I have a Moby and was tired of tying it when I was out in places like parking lots of grocery stores and the airport. I was hoping this would be a lot faster. I'm disappointed. THe material is very similar to the moby only it has a little less stretch - which means it's still HOT. You DO still have to wrap it, it's just that it starts you off by having two loops instead of one long piece of fabric. You still have to use the sash to get it secure whatsoever and that's a pain to drag around. All in all, it's way too similar to the Moby and I wasted my money by getting a second. Buy this OR Moby, but don't expect it to be a second type of carrier like I did."
3,Sizing is really tricky,"Okay I read tons of the reviews listed here and figured this wrap would be easier than the Moby. I wanted something fast and simple, just like all the countless videos I watched. Okay....first, ya gotta get the size right. I'm 5' 8, slim frame so I went with the small, since everyone mentioned how stretchy it was. After I washed it first, tried it and it barely fit me, let alone my son. The wrap so shrunk and it doesn't matter how ""stretchy"" it suppose to get, it wasn't gonna fit. So I exchanged it for a medium. Initially, I thought it was still to small, but still gave it a shot. It was better, but not by much. My son is 4 weeks and I felt like I was squishing him. I'm going to put this on hold until he's older."
5,My favorite thing I've bought for baby!,This is probably one of the best purchases I made for my baby girl. I love it! Super comfy and easy to put on and get baby in and out. Dont know why I didnt buy one of these sooner!!!
5,our go-to carrier,We will be purchasing another here soon. We have twins and dad likes to wear them too so a second one is in order.Baby feels secure in this. It's easy to put on. I find the Moby a pain in the butt. only issue I'm having is my infant is growing way too fast so we might need a bigger one.
3,Not for me,"I am not a ""carrier"" person. I like strollers much better; however sometimes it is not possible to bring stroller everywhere. I was looking for something simple and easy to carry my 11 month average size son in. I thought this was going to be easy to put on, but after trying it I gave up. I am 5.6 and 110 pounds and I ordered the small size. When I had a sweater on, it was very tight. I do not understand why, since I sometimes wear XS shirts. I tried to adjust it but it just didn't work. My son didn't like it and wanted out of it. The only positive was that the material and the color were nice. I returned this carrier, because I knew I wasn't going to use it. I ordered ring sling instead, and it works much better for me, because it is easy and fast to put on and off."
3,Its OK,"I love how quick and easy it is to get my son into this, but it feels like im crushing him, he doesnt seem to mind (I got the right size and everything) maybe its just me.. Also my baby is a little space heater so we both get hot when using this."
5,Such a good investment!,"This is my third carrier. I have a peanut shell, a baby bjorn, and now the baby k'tan and the k'tan wins hands down. The baby bjorn is nice, but my baby always looked uncomfortable in it. The peanut shell was great when she was a newborn, but really strains your back and shoulders. I love that with the baby k'tan the weight is distributed on your back so it's very comfortable. My baby loves it. I was going to buy a Moby wrap, but after seeing my friend putting it on, it just looked like such a hassle, so I decided to buy the baby k'tan. This is a great carrier, you won't be disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the baby k'tan after reviewing many different carriers because I needed one for an infant. When i received this, the instructions were fairly easy to follow, but was disappointed in the sizing recommendations! I got the XS (i am 5'3, and petite) and although the way it fell on my body was correct like the instructions said, my baby of 3 weeks ( 8 lb 6 oz right now) barely could fit in it. It was super snug and difficult to get one of the straps on my shoulders without feeling like i was smashing the air out of my baby. She would fuss and cry as I would try to adjust her. There is no way that she would last in this carrier longer than another week before I would have to upgrade in size. Very disappointed that this carrier seems limited, not sure if i am going to attempt to try a size Small or go with another carrier altogether."
5,So worth it,"I used the Moby just about every day since my little one was born 5 months ago. I thought a baby K'tan would be a little easier when we are on the go. I was right! It's MUCH easier to put on if you are in the car getting ready to go in somewhere. You don't have yards of fabric getting all over the floor. And the fabric is wide enough so he can ride with his feet inside still. He loves sitting in a little ball riding around with me! So cute! ;)The only drawback to the baby K'tan is that it doesn't distribute the weight evenly on your shoulders AND hips like the moby. If you have to use it for any amount of time I would recomend the moby BUT having said that, it's also not a good idea to leave baby in ANY carrier for more than an hour. It's not like they can tell you, ""HEY MOM, MY LEGS FELL ASLEEP HOURS AGO!"""
5,Excellent Product!,"Every mother (or father) should have one of these, and I've recommended it to my fellow mommies! I love that there are no buckles or extra fabric and that it can be worn a number of ways. The fabric is stretchy and comfortable, and eases back and shoulder strain - even with a very big baby! My little one loves riding around in this!"
5,Saving our sanity,"We are new parents to twins, and I purchased this sling because of the ability to actually have two newborns in here it once. It does work! More often than not, I only have one baby in at a time though. At first my husband was dubious, but once he realized that a fussy baby calms down in moments he is a believer. We actually ended up ordering a second one, and we often each wear a baby while going about household chores, or to calm them down after middle of the night feedings.I haven't used any other sling, so cannot compare it to others, but I would definitely recommend the Baby K'tan!"
4,"Easy and comfortable, too stretchy",This is such an easy wrap to use! And very comfortable. Baby loves it.Only one problem: the fabric stretches with each use so after a few days' of use I have to wash it to shrink it back down so the baby doesn't end up dangling too far down.
5,Worth the $,"Very happy with my purchase of the K'Tan. My 2 month old will fuss for a tiny bit at first, and then fall fast asleep, just as she did at 1 month old. The online videos are extremely helpful. Material is sturdy and washes well. Their sizing chart was accurate for me. I'm fluctuating between 125-130lbs, and I'm 5'4"", and the xs is just right. A little tight at first but stretches nicely and supports my daughter well. Very happy I bit the bullet and purchased this."
1,Don't follow the size guidelines,Disappointed with the size recommendation on Baby Ktan's site and it was too small. My daughter doesn't like it probably because she doesn't like being swaddled. I recommend trying it out with your baby before buying.
3,Had to return - bought a Moby.,"After much research, I decided to buy the Baby K'Tan instead of the Moby wrap. However, I ordered a small (I'm 5'10"" 155 lbs; size 8-10) and when I got it it was very tight. I put it on and the material was thicker than jersey knit and didn't seem to give all that much. I debated whether or not I was getting the correct fit, and ultimately decided that it may be safer for baby to go with the Moby since that's a one-size-fit-all item. I didn't want to deal with sending the small back, ordering a medium, and that feeling too big. I think this is a great item, if you are confident you have the right size...but since I wasn't, I just made it easier and went with the Moby."
4,Finally!,"I own way too many slings/carriers. As the new mother to an arm hungry baby, I was beginning to get desperate as my back began developing all sorts of pains from carrying my son all day. I went through 5 slings/carriers:Moby Wrap - I personally found this one annoying to put on and take off, but it is admittedly a very comfy and versatile carrier.Hava Sling - I don't know what I was thinking buying this. Not comfortable and borderline unsafe, if you ask me. The baby seems to sit too deeply in the pocket no matter what you do.Peanut Shell - So uncomfortable! Dug into my shoulder.Ergo - No complaints but not as versatile and comfy as I'd like.Dr. Sears (the non-adjustable sling) - Same complaints as the HavaAnyways, this one is comfy, versatile, easy to use and baby loves it. The only con is that it does stretch out after using it, so you have to wash it and dry it to get it back to the not-stretched-out size. Other than that, I love it!"
3,Pretty good except...,"so my husband and i originally got the Moby wrap, which we love, but decided to look for something quicker to put on and could be more on the go, so we got this k-tan. its pretty good except that since it is already ""assembled"" you cannot control the sizing, esp when it stretches out. so, i am 5'4"", 115 and the xsmall is too big on me, so i prefer using the moby since i can control the tightness of it. my husband uses the k-tan and it fits it perfect, esp while the munchkin is a newborn. maybe ill be able to use it when hes bigger..."
2,Would have been great if all parts came with it,"I was extremely disappointed as this carrier was supposed to come with a separate piece that is a support band, which is required to use the carrier safely with a newborn. The box arrived looking like it had already been opened, and the band wasn't in there, and neither was an infant hat, that is also supposed to come with it. I just returned it instead of worrying whether I'd get everything the next time."
2,Maggie,I did not like the baby ktan. Not comfortable for my baby boy or myself. I recommend that you look into buying a better carrier like the ergo baby carrier. This carrier is worth the money. Don't waste your money on the baby ktan. You will not be happy with the baby ktan.
4,We love it and the baby does too,"But we got the wrong size. We both wear large so we got that size, but we are both short (I am 5' 3) so it didn't fit right so we had to exchange it so keep that in mind. My husband and I both use it and for now the baby prefers it to the Bjorn we got, and since I am nursing and my chest is very sensitive the Bjorn caused a lot of discomfort in that area, but not the K'tan! It is comfy for both parties and very easy to wear/travel with! I wish we would have gotten this from the start instead of waiting until the baby was a month old."
5,Best Purchase EVER,This is by far the most comfortable carrier that I have tried. It swaddles the baby and keeps him safe. I actually can get things done and accomplished!!! Such a relief!
5,Baby K'tan-love it!,"I really like this carrier and I can get it on by myself, which is great. There atr lots of ways to use it but I've only tried a couple since my baby is only 7 weeks. I think it will only get better as he gets more head control."
4,Useful item,"This is great. Comes with a book that shows different holds for different ages. Also contains reminders for safety on each section so that you can always double check baby is held in the best possible way. Comfortable although I haven't used for extended periods yet, so not too sure how mu back would feel after that. That said it is great to hold the little one in when I have things to do and she doesn't want to be on her own. It means less crying, more contented baby and more accomplished. Such a great thing to have. Easy to carry as well, can be put in the included pouch and carried in the diaper bag until needed. Only thing let to add is that I am quite large breasted and she protrudes further from my chest when I use it compared with when her father uses it, but that's personal and to be expected I guess. Looking forward to using this product as my little one grows."
2,Not for me too hard to use,"I think this might work for some, but I had a very hard time following the instructions how to get the carrier on and how to put the baby in different positions. In my sleep deprived state as a new mom I had to send it back because it was too confusing!"
3,k'Tan Baby Carrier a Must,"I would definitely say that this is a must on any shower registry. Ordered it after a friend said she loved hers. My baby doesn't like the cradle hold in the k'tan, but we use the outer-facing and inner-facing holds all the time. I have found it to be more comfortable on my shoulders than the baby bjjorn. I use it in restaurants if he needs to nap, and take him grocery shopping/ errand running in it as he dislikes the car seat in the shopping cart method. Highly recommend this!!"
1,Horrible waste of money,"I bought the baby Ktan and my son hates it. It's way too small and I'm a very petite woman. It's a huge pain to get on and you have to twist him this way and that to get him inside the carrier. Then once inside, it's hard on the back (even after adjusting the ring in the back), and too tight. Maybe he's just too big for this? It's so uncomfortable for him and for me. Save your money!"
2,Sizes run too small,"It says that X-small will fit a woman size 2 and 4. Not true!!!. I'm barely 2 and the x-smal didn't feel comfortable if you are carrying a baby. I felt like my baby couldn't breath. Also it is very complicated to use, you really need to take a tutorial. In my opinion is expensive, difficult to use and wrong sized."
1,buyer beware,"I'm sure this is a lovely product if it works for you. My wife is pretty small 5 ft 1 or so, and the Small sized was too big while the Extra Small was too small. The customer service department was decent in getting us the different sizes, but both flopped, and we ended up getting a baby bjorn, which seems the safer bet in retrospect."
1,Not user friendly!!,"This item is not friendly at ALL!! The manual that comes with this product only shows you some ways to go about using it and other than that nothing else. Now I know why the seller did not accept returns, cuz this item SUCKS!! Especially when you have a little one that you were going to use it for. I will never buy anything like this again without seeing it at the store!!"
1,Problem with the size,"I ordered size medium but I received size small, and there is no way that I can use it. Sizing info doesn't look right may be large is the only usable option."
2,I get the wrong size,"I get the wrong size.. My hubby and I are different size, so very hard to get the correct size when I put order.I found quite hard to use this baby carrier, I need to teach my hubby or mother-in-law to use before they use it.."
5,EXCELLENT CLASSIC REGGAE FEEL,"This is one of the best reggae albums i own i listen to it all the time, it gives u a old jamica feel and the kids and adults love it too, when i put the cd in everyone asks where i got it, i ABOSOLUTLEY reccomend this album to anybody even if reggae isnt your feel of music..... one love"
4,Nice product for the price.,Decent leather and reasonable construction. We will see how it holds up to daily abuse.
3,the good and the bad,"This CD is good but I enjoy mostly fast hollywood songs and this CD has about 4 fast and the rest slow. The most dissapointing thing on the CD to me was the Lena Horne version of ""singing in the rain"" it just didn't kick like the Gene Kelly version."
1,WORTHLESS,"There are severe and recurring issues with DVDs jamming and making the unit unstable. The manufacturer fixed it once. And they needed everything back, the useless player all the speakers, wires, remotes, etc. to fix it.Four months later, a major electronics chain repaired it for $149.Now four months later its jammed up again.NEVER, ever, will I buy another Sony anything."
4,"Picture fantastic, but, oh the sound!","As all previous reviews state, the story and picture quality are more than adequate on this DVD release. The sound, however -- at least on my DVD -- sounds like it was mastered over a Trans-Atlantic telephone line. I get the feeling of rushing water every time I watch it. It doesn't muddy the dialogue too much, but it definitely could have been mastered using better soundtrack elements."
5,Better Early Than Never Produced.,"Better Early Than Never. Unfortunate for this motion picture, it was released before America's entry into WW II. It may have been received with better critcal reviews in 1942. But the story is compelling, the acting first-rate, and in my opinion exposed the terrible evil that was transforming the lives of all Germans and the rest of Europe. A must see for all movie buffs who enjoy well-made motion pictues."
4,WAR DRAMA!!!!!,"Great war film. However, the transfer by VCI was quite disappointing with video quality. Some parts of the film were fine and others looked somewhat muddy, despite VCI's promotion. The print used was a re-issue, as evidenced during the credits, by Favorite Films. It's possible there may be 3-4 minutes of missing footage."
