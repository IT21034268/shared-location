2,The most forced game EVER!!,"If you like DBZ than what are you waiting for? Buy it.Otherwise..SKIP!!This game was born in a marketing meeting[duh] and it shows,badly.The graphics are good and having a bunch of DBZ characters is cool.But this game has cruddy collision detection and ALL THE ATTACKS LOOK THE SAME!![shudder].Avoid unless you want to see HOW TV BASED GAMES [ARE] SO BAD!!"
2,junk.,"Ok the graphics are decent, but i've seen better. Full motion video, GOOD JOB! Other than that, if you really like the DBZ seris you will find that this game is just plain horrible. Infogames could have done a lot better than they did on this, this thing looked like it had a development cycle of about 2 months. For example, when goku falls off snake way would it be too much to ask to actually have the lil cleaning machine with goku sleeping on it and having him fall off. No they don't do this, they have him say ""Oh no, I lost my balance I think I am going to fall!"". Combat is just freaking stupid, you basically just have the enemy chase you until you use solar flare to blind and then use a whole 4 differant attacks (melee included)to pummel him. All in all i found this a flashy, rushed, shadow of a game. Not worth your buying it, just get the rom."
1,LAME GAME!,LEGACY OF GOKU IS A DRY AND DULL ACTION RPG FOR THE GBA AND THE SPRITES ARE CHEESY LOOKING TOO! PLUS THERE'S STUPID SIDE QUESTS THAT WEREN'T ORIGINALLY THERE IN THE TV SHOW AND IT WOULD SEEM LIKE A WASTE OF TIME FOR GOKU TO GO FINDING A STUPID KID'S TOY BOAT WHILE HIS SON GOHAN HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED BY RADITZ! I GUESS GOKU IS JUST A PLAIN IDIOT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT!
2,This is a boring game,"Dont' bother with this one. It is very disappointing. Very little of interest happens. The fights are dull and would be too difficult or at least too slow, except that I have discovered some hints on the net. It looks horrible too. Sorry, but it is a dud."
2,Not very good.....but i've played worse,"I hate games that are based on movies and cartoons...thy put no effort into it.They just make it so hard core fans of whatever the show or movie is will buy it because they loooove the show.This game is pretty bad..it has a bad, and hard to aim battle system..i was thinking of buying this but i changed my mind after i tried it. and it is really short..i recommend Golden sun if you like Adventure/RPG games"
3,it was ok,"THIS GAME WAS OK, THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT THE MUSIC IS GREAT. BUT IT ONLY HAD A FEW PROBLEMS SUCH AS YOU DONT LEARN THE KAMEHAMEHA FROM KING KAI YOU LEARN THE KAIO KEN AND THE SPIRIT BOMB FROM HIM. SECOND YOUR NOT VERY STRONG IN THIS GAME EVEN WHEN YOU GROW LEVELS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOSTROY ONE OF FREEZA'S MEN WITH ON HIT WITH THE KAMEHAMEHA. THIS GAME SHOULD ALSO BE LONG ALOT LONGER. ALSO WHEN YOU FIGHT RADIZT'S PICCILO IS SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU BUT HE DOESNT IN THIS GAME. ALSO SON GOKU DOESNT DO EXTRA STUFF ON NAMEK BUT YOU DO IN THE GAME AND HE DOESNT. OVER ALL OUT OF 10 I WOULD GIVE THIS GAME A 8.5."
1,Piece of [Stuff]!!!!,"I am a serious major hardcore DBZ fan. When I heard of a DBZ game coming out for the GBA I was exstatic! When my friend got the game first I asked if I could play it on our bus ride home from school. I only played the game for 1 and a half fricken' hours (and didn't even get to frieza) and I was bored the whole time! The movement was horrible, the plot was extermely dull, the fighting [disappointed], the villans were easyly beaten, and the quest stunk hard. I could not believe that any one would sink so low as to soil the DragonBall Z name in such a manner! NO ONE BUY THIS GAME NO MATTER WHAT!! If you do there goes [money] that could have been used to buy something more entertaining like a book on Astro-Physics!"
2,"Legacy of Goku - RUN, RUN NOW!!!","First of all i went to the trouble of importing this game from the US! BIG mistake!! Its follows the storyline of the series close enough, but thats about it! 3 energy attacks, Ki-Blast (which you never use once you get the Kamehameha), Solar Flare (good for pretty much nothing), and Kamehameha (which goes about 5 foot). The ememys are lame, the only real challenge is the dogs and dinosaurs at the start of the game, but once you increse your power the only challenge is finding the items to complete each challenge! Which is not hard!The bosses are easiers than most the other enemies, I hardly noticed defeating defeating Ginu squad and defeating Friza was little more than a joke!Unless you are buying this for a 5yr old DON'T! you will complete it in a matter of hours and by very, very dissapointed!"
2,Good...But needs improvement,"When i first got the game i was like ""Yay a good american DBZ RPG yay!!""...boy was i wrong...The gameplay seemed OK in the beginning...the battles just kept getting easier...yet annoying...and the plot was a piece of ([...]...its a rental..not a game to own...ya can beat it in an hour..Pros:First DBZ RPG,Interesting battle system..Cons:Bad graphics,Short game play,Bad plot,Annoyingly long battle in the end...Overall i rate this thing 2 stars...cuz it deserves it for conning innocent DBZ fans into buying this horrid game"
3,It's to easy..,Yup thats right. I love DBZ. But come on you've got to be jokeing this game was to easy. What was up with the DOGS!!... Man all you could move was this arms. I hope you buy the PS2 game instead because it's so much better you can move them.(the legs too)If you like tekken and all those you'll love this game.(PS2)
1,"Maybe if you like the series, but even then...","First off, i borrowed this game from my friend, would of given it to him the next day if it weren't for the weekend. This game to start out with, is short, poor coming to controls, annoying because its based on a ton of worthless side quests, and definatly not worth getting. I have played tons of games, but i think this game just doesn't cut it. Even a huge dbz fan couldn't say its great. Get it if you love the series, then it might not be a waste. But as a game, i really can't say anthing nice about it. It just doesn't cut it, sorry."
1,TOO SHORT,1 major problem. TOO SHORT. If you can find somewhere to rent it do that. I beat it in an hour. This only Goes From the Sayian Saga through the end of the Frieza Saga! I waisted [money]on this game. Play Starcraft it is WAY better and is only like [less money]
3,Short but Sweet,"OK here's how it works, you go on several quests and fight many enemies up to frieza, where it ends. this is a great game but it's depressinlgy short, I mean I beat in a little under an hour, and no i'm not one of those people who are video game pro's, I'm just an ordinary 13 year-old kid who likes dbz, my game playing skills are just average. Yet it does give you some fun for the short time it takes you to beat it. it leaves a few things out and mixes up some other stuff but other than that it's pretty acruate. unfortuneitly it has little to no replay value and it's not that realistic even for a 32 bit game, good graphics for gameboy color, but not for gba. All-in-all only get it if your a really big fan and/or feel the need for this game, and have other gba games (I didn't and it sucked) because it'll get pretty boring, really quick, otherwise (or you just have a lot a extra cash hangin around)."
1,I want my money back!,"This game stinks! For one thing, it's way too short. I know from other GBA games that it would have been possible to fit the whole series in this game, if they just took out the cartoon in the beginning.Next, the story barely follows the storyline set by the comics and cartoons. Goku is supposed to know the Kamehameha when he was a kid in ""Dragon Ball"", way before the DBZ series, not to mention he does not have a limit to how long he can fly in the show. You also can't see what is happening elsewhere like in the show.Also, the controls are hard to get used to. The character moves too slow to hold anyone's attention for long, even in his Super-Saiyan form.Add this all up, along with a boring fighting style, mediocre graphics (except for the cartoon), and no replayability or secrets to unlock, and you get this money waster of a game. I hope you won't have to go through the same thing I did."
2,Dragon Ballz,"I played 2 first, was put together way better than this one. Very Disapointed, only played it for 15 minutes. But if you play this one first you can probobly enjoy them both."
3,Fun but a little boring,There game is fun and all but u die to fast. I am a dbz fan and i know about the shows and goku dosn't get beaten that fast. It's fun that you get to walk around all over the place but get real you don't even get to use the kahmehameha attack right before you fought nappa and radit Vegeata. Goku learned to use it since he was a kid. And if u know nothing about dbz u r want to return it. So only buy it if enjoy dbz and u don't mind getting fustrated. One other thing dbz log2 and buu's fury is more worth buying
5,It Blew me Away,This is the absolutly best game ive ever playedYou start out on master roshies Island and ratitz kidnaps gohanthen goku and piccolo team up. They go and find ratitz and literaly kicks his [REAR]. [Rear] picolo dont help the player any until the computer takes over.Then you travel snakeway and journey to King Kies planet and train with him. after you complete his tests he teaches you the kame ha me ha wave. Then you travel back to Earth and fight the sayans Vegeeta and Napa. Goku Loses against Vegeeta and the camputer takes over and gohan beats the krap out of him. Then you journey to the planet namek and fight the ginu force and frieza but when you fight frieza after you defeat the ginu force you transform into a SUPER SAYEN and fight him. When You win the Game is over. Even though the game does not follow the story line that good It is still the best game ive ever played so I give it 5 stars out of 5
2,Don't spend your money on such garbage.,"This game stinks. I mean I like tough games. But not super, super, super tough. Good thing it's not mine. It's my brother's. You get a choice if you want to fight Princess Snake or not. King Kai teaches you the Kemaemea Wave. What kind of game is that? Everybody knows Master Roshi teaches Goku in Dragonball. And little dogs kill you. That's stupid! And Goku, the protector of Earth and the strongest guy, saves cats and rescues little kids in this game. If I were you, I would instead get Dragonball Z: Legacy of Goku 2 or Dragonball Z Budokai."
3,Legacy of Goku 2 Much better,"Now that they Have Legacy Of Goku 2, Legacy of Goku 1 looks like a joke. Legacy Of Goku 1 was an Okay Game but I wouldnt call it awesome. The Graphics were okay but nothing great. The Sound Was sometimes really annoying. They also Neede to Expand the Character choices and needed to expand the Game farther because it was a little on the short side.The intros and extras were pretty nice. But what was really annoying was the Temple thing you had to accomplish before going on to battle Freiza. If you want a Legacy of Goku game Get the New one, Legacy of Goku 2, it is much better than the First. I would not buy the first unless you are a die hard DBZ fan."
5,Just like the show!,"Dragonball Z: The Legasy of Goku is so cool! If you like the show you will love this. Just like the show you are Goku, and your son Gohan is kidnapped. You first have to complete tasks to increase your experiance points. Some tasks you are required to do and some are optional. The more you do the stronger you get. Your first boss is Vageta. If you get close to winning he, like the show, transforms into a giant monkey, and then Yajourobie cuts off his tail. This is the best game ever!"
3,Immudyne Macroforce 7.5 Mg PlusC,"I have been using this product for a month, and can tell you that I am being satisfied,I am 45 years old and I feel better since then. I greatly recommend it to the people, who like me, has got ""middle-age"" energy insufficiency and any complains according to this state of life."
1,Terrible,the point of a wireless network is to be able to have a computer a decent distance (like upstairs) away from the acces point. This product WILL NOT DO THIS!DONT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PCs IN THE SAME ROOM!
2,Mildly entertaining,"This was a book club selection and the book did have several funny, entertaining moments but it was very shallow, many times painfully slow-moving, mindless and occasionally offensive. There are countless other books I would rather have rather spent my time on. If someone gives you this book or you can pick up a free or very cheap, used copy it is a decent time waster (think loud waiting room material) that doesn't require any concentration, otherwise, save your money and buy something more worth your valuable time."
2,Well...I just didn't really like it.,"David Sedaris is the Dave Barry of the NPR set--and just about as funny. (""Ain't I a riot?"" he silently asks the reader every three sentences or so, and the answer is no.)The story about the prostitute might have been amusing, if Sedaris had chosen to poke fun at the upper-middle-class family for being a bunch of sheltered and condescending weenies. Instead he seemed to think the family was pre-e-etty edgy for entertaining a prostitute (a PROSTITUTE! har-dee-har-HAR! an unattractive one! chuckle! in ripped fishnet stockings!) in their nice suburban home.Wouldn't all NPR listeners like to be so awesomely cool and free of social prejudice as to have over for dinner a real-live beaten-up prostitute who works at a cafeteria and smokes? How gritty! How true to life! How...anthropologically compelling!"
2,Dark themes: Not the usual Sedaris book,"For the record: I love, love, love David Sedaris. But this collection not only fell short...it completely missed its mark. The book begins with a humorous, self-deprecating story about his experience as a Macy's Christmas elf. It was the warm and familiar style I so enjoy about this author. The anecdotes that followed were dark, cold, and insensitive. Not all were autobiographical, which is unfortunate since Sedaris' personal stories have always been part of the charm. Maybe he was experimenting with a new genre; perhaps he was just finding his personal style. His other work is so good that he can be forgiven."
4,Classic Sedaris Comedy,A great short-read for anyone who is looking for some laughs. I'm a huge David Sedaris fan and although this isn't his best it sure has some hilarious moments.
3,Revisitations of familiar journeys,"I enjoyed the opportunity to read David Sedaris' stories, some of which I had read elsewhere. It is a good format to launch someone on 'the good ship Sedaris' but for those who have been initiated, it was all too brief in the newness arena. It rattles along very comfortably, like an old Chevrolet, but we do like the smell of a new car every so often, don't we?"
4,His mother says he always stirs the turd...,"Having encountered the praises of Sedaris by other reviewers online I decided to pick up Holidays on Ice as my introduction to his art. It's a short, fast, and hilarious read on a topic that brings much joy, sorrow, laughter, and terror to us all: Christmas.Flipping through the book before purchasing it I see a chapter titled ""Dinah the Christmas Whore"" and I knew it was going to be a bumpy ride. ""The Santa Land Diaries"" should be made into a movie. Or at least should be something read to your family instead of that tired old ""Twas the night before..."" rot. Blisters the Elf had me in stitches during this story. And the fictitious family letter ""Season's Greetings"" was a laugh riot.I will definitely be reading more of Sedaris in the future."
3,"A good start, but a mediocre finish","I had such high hopes for this book. I heard about it when the author read an excerpt on a late night talk show. Two entries really stand out: the elf story and the Christmas Pageant critique. If only the others were as good.The last entry, ""Christmas is for giving,"" is just NOT FUNNY. I appreciate satire, but this just goes over the edge. Sedaris is at his best when he doesn't grasp at straws and instead just points out the foibles of human nature. He does a much better job making us laugh at situations that really happen.The Christmas letter and ""Dinah, the Christmas Whore,"" are somewhat redeeming, but the book starts off so well that it's hard to believe it could end so anti-climatically."
4,A different twist to the Christmas season,"My husband and I listened to ""SantaLand diaries"" on our way from St.Paul to Milwaukee in a snowstorm and have yet to hear a funnier Christmas tale. It's an incredibly humorous twist to what many of us have as as a Christmas memory. If you don't find this funny, get a humor transplant."
3,Covered by Naked and Barrel Fever,"This makes an excellent gift or ""Sedaris Starter"" for the unsuspecting fan of David's twisted sense of humor and outlook on life. Most of the stories are reprints from his two previous books, ""Naked"" and ""Barrel Fever"". I received this book as a gift, and put it out during the holidays to judge how enlightened my holiday guests are. However, if you're looking to get a good sampling of David Sedaris's work, consider his two other books."
1,Never received book,It has been more than a month since I ordered this book and it never came. I emailed the sender and they never responded. Next time I won't buy Amazon.
1,Interesting,"I put this book on my wish list after reading various David Sedaris reviews. I am currently reading another book by him that I am enjoying, but this collection of stories was a bit disturbing for me."
3,Holidays on Ice paperback book,"I intended the item to be a Christmas gift, but when it came, it was so inconsequential that it became just an item in her Christmas box and I found something else to wrap as her main gift, which was fine; it just wasn't what I expected."
5,"Hilariously clinical, but appropriately","Holidays on Ice is perfect for those who give no apologies for complaining about the ills of society during the holiday season. It feels nice to have affirmation for the complaints you've been making over the years. Whether it's the tension that mounts while waiting in line to see Santa or the humble-brags found in family Christmas cards, Sedaris seems to have a knack for observing all the naughty acts of the holiday season. I laughed at ever story, without guilt."
1,not at all what I expected.,"Not at all what I expected, very negative - expected more since I had read the sample. Wouldn't recommend at all."
2,Not really funny,Snarky and not all that humorous. More cruel than insightful. I may try and read something else by him later but only if it is free
1,Glad I didn't pay for it,"I downloaded this book from the library onto my kindle. I pretty much read anything but I could NOT even get through the first story. I don't know who proofread the kindle edition but I found words repeating and then sentences dropping off not making any sense. If I could give it zero stars, I would. I had no expectations since I have not read from this author before so I guess I wasn't as disappointed as most. I never even got to the baby killing I see people reviewing about. Thank God for that."
1,Honestly? Not funny.,"My friends all told me how hilarious this book was, so I bought it. Maybe I'm not in the right mood for satire (it is Christmas, after all), but it just seemed like one big curmudgeony rant. I was even bored with most of the rants, they were too long and stopped being even remotely funny after a page or two."
3,Blah....,"Holidays on Ice was really a slight waste of time for me. Again, Sedaris set the bar SO high with his previous publications that anything else will simply not do. I forced myself to finish this and did so with barely a chuckle. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for Mr. Sedaris, but his missed the mark on this one. But just a wee bit. If you're a Sedaris fan, by all means, read this book. Just don't expect too much."
2,More odd and disconcerting than his usual works..,"I'm a huge fan of David Sedaris' books, but other than the ""Santaland Diaries"" and ""Dinah"" stories, I couldn't get into it. The other stories weren't funny, the pace was plodding despite the fact that these were short stories, and I was actually somewhat uncomfortable reading them.I'd recommend most of his other books, just not this one."
1,Laundry Day will never be the same,Simply did not like the book. Couldn't get past the Season's Greetings ridiculous account of an illegitimate daughter from Vietnam showing up on the family's doorstep.
1,If I could give this no stars I would!,"Since when did the murder of a baby and two 10 year old boys become funny or even ""dark"" humor? Not only were they murdered, but the two boys are murdered by a sex offender who was ""given"" the two boys as a Christmas gift by their parents in an attempt to ""out-do"" their neighbors! The baby is murdered by a long lost daughter from vietnam who, after her step-mother asks her to ""watch the baby"", ""WATCH THE BABY,"" which is screamed at the listener again and again, promptly puts the baby in the washing machine and then into the dryer. The stories are just bad...really, really bad. Thankfully I checked this CD out at the library and I can say, I will not choose this author again."
4,Good but not my favorite,I have read plenty of Sedaris. They have all been enjoyable and this one is no exception. I enjoyed reading this book however it was not my favorite.
3,"David, You're Getting Lazy","Funny at times but not as good as some of his previous work. It makes one wonder, if some of us just have a finite amount of talent."
2,"Classis Sedaris, but half are from his earlier books","If you haven't read 'Barrel Fever' and 'Naked' this is 4 stars. If you have, you've already read 2/3 of this book, so give it just another 2 stars."
4,Very funny,"Easy read, funny but not as funny as some of this other works. Still, you can't go wrong ordering this book - especially for the holidays."
4,Best Sedaris,"This is BY FAR my favorite Sedaris book. It is a quick read for the holidays (or really anytime) and every story is funny- one of the few books that I honestly laugh out loud at, every time!"
2,Ho Ho Hum,"If you're looking for a collection of funny Christmas stories to lift your spirits, I wouldn't suggest this book. The first story has quite a few funny moments, is believable and written well, but I found the rest of the collection to be a little too bitter, minus the foreign Christmas story. That had a funny ending but then the last line put a damper on even that one. Also, who uses the word ""retarded"" anymore..? It's so NOT funny to call anyone that."
3,"Hilarious at best, mediocre at worst","The first story, ""SantaLand Diaries"", is hilarious, as funny a piece of writing as I have ever read.The other stories are quite amusing, but don't rise to the level of the first. Sedaris clearly has exceptional talent, and I will definitely try out his other works. Comedy(whether performing or writing) clearly being the most difficult art, makes this collection worth the modest retail price."
2,Some things aren't funny...,"I generally like David Sedaris; in fact he's one of my favorites. But when his stories veer off into the death of children, almost gratuitously, I can't see the humor. This is, please note, the first book of his that I haven't enjoyed. But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me."
3,Doesn't quite live up to all the hype,"By now just about everyone has heard that this is THE book to read during the Holidays as well as being the perfect little 'stocking stuffer' gift. In some regards this may be the case - especially with the brilliant first short story in this tiny tome, 'The Santa Land Diaries,' a hilarious memoir of Sedaris' experience working as a seasonal elf at Macy's. Unfortunately the remaining five stories fail to sustain the high level of excellence delivered early on making the remaining 2/3's of the book somewhat of a disappointment.If you are a fan of Sedaris or curious about all the hoopla surrounding his style of humor then this book is certainly worth your while, especially with its brilliant opening and the fact that it shouldn't take you more then an hour to read from cover to cover."
3,"Home for the Holidays, Boy AM I GLAD I LIVE AWAY FROM HOME","Holidays are trying at best, you try to get the shopping done, you try not to gain 10 pounds and you try not to kill your relatives.David Sedaris has captured the true spririt of the holidays in his collection of short stories ""HOLIDAYS ON ICE"". And no way is Tiny Tim gonna make us feel all warm and sappy.With a sharp tongue and even shaper typewriter, Sedaris tells the tales of being an Elf at Macy's. Another about how his sister brings home a co-worker who is on a work-release program from prison and the most absurb tale on giving until it hurts, literally. If you have just been turned on to Sedaris you might be a little dissapointed in this book, but there are a few laughs but all tales are so well written you will be compelled to finish this book in one evening.For those of you new to Sedaris, you will get a quick look into the sense of humor of one of America's up and coming humorists."
4,Holidays on ice,"An oustanding and hilarious book describing holiday events. It describes well, normal people and families who shop at the last minute and whos children have holiday plays that bore your brains out. I highly recomend this book for anyone with the least bit sense of humor.Max"
4,Not a Miracle on 34th Street...,"If you are looking for the literary equivalent of ""It's a Wonderful Life""-this book is definitely NOT for you. However, if you appreciate slightly cynical and sardonic commentary on the holidays, you will most likely appreciate this set of short stories by David Sedaris. From Jim Timothy, the extortionist who preys upon a Pentecostal church, to Dinah, the ""Christmas [...]"" Sedaris packs his vignettes with unforgettable characters who will make you laugh-even though you know Clarence the Angel would disapprove. If you've had enough of family bickering and other such holiday treats, curl up with this offering and you'll find a kindred spirit in David Sedaris."
3,Not his best.,Book in excellent condition; contents disappointing. Would not recommend to any of my friends/relatives. Not much more to say after what that.
3,"Not bad, but not great","I absolutely LOVED his other book, Me Talk Pretty One Day and laughed out loud the entire time I was reading it!Naturally, I thought Holidays on Ice would be of the same caliber, but it was a little bit of a letdown. His opening story about working as an elf at Macy's was absolutely HILARIOUS, but the stories that followed seemed to be progressively less and less funny. Several stories had very little, if anything at all, to do with Christmas so I really don't understand how this book even really qualifies as a holiday anthology to start with.I'm not saying the book was bad, because it wasn't. You might buy it and it might be right up your alley. I read the whole book cover to cover and mostly enjoyed it and had a few quiet chuckles, however it just didn't have that laugh-out-loud quality that his other books have."
2,LOVE DAVID SEDARIS,This is the first book I haven't like as much as the others ...but his elf experience at Macy's is worth the price of admission. Love his work my favorite is Me Talk Pretty.
2,Overrated,"I bought this for the Santaland Diaries, which I'd heard was very funny. It turned out to not be much of anything. I don't know, I guess I expected the shenanigans to be more interesting than ""Look through this window and you can see Cher!"" I read a couple of the other stories too, but they likewise failed to hold my interest, so I gave up before finishing."
3,Stories Are Hit or Miss,"I mainly purchased this since it was a Kindle sale and I was in the Christmas mood. A few of the stories, particularly the first one, were funny and I enjoyed them. Others were kind of blah, and some I had to skim through as they weren't interesting at all. If you're a fan of David Sedaris then my guess is that you will enjoy these stories. I'd never read anything by him before, and found it okay but not something I'd purchase again."
3,Just okay,"Not a badly written book, it just didn't hold my interest. Some humorous episodes, but a bit too much rambling for me. Simply a matter of taste"
3,Definitely NOT upbeat humor,"I've seen this book described as delightful, acerbic, sardonic, charming. It isn't humorous at all, instead it is a heavyhanded bitter collection of short stories by someone who apparently doesn't like the human race very much."
2,"Funny at first, but lost my attention.","This is the first David Sedaris book I've purchased and attempted to read. The first couple of chapters were interesting and funny but didn't have anything to do with dealing with family. It was about his Christmas job. I didn't necessarily like his view of families and children in which the humor was a little too dark for my taste. Halfway through, there was really more mundane daily stuff that didn't hold my attention. I didn't have any interest in finishing this book."
5,Excellent book - loved it,"Really funny stories, interesting plots, my favourite was the story starring Khe San and Jocelyn.....what a hoot - highly recommend you buy this as a holiday book."
1,Infantacide! Hahaha!,"Really horrible. First story is ok, but the second is disgusting and sick. Don't read this. I am sorry I paid money for it. Not funny. Wish I never read it."
2,You Tricked Me,"Having read all of David Sedaris' books and having loved them, I was glad to drop $10 on this small new book. The only problem is that the stories are not new. Nowhere does it say this on the book cover. You have to turn to page 4 to see that almost every story appeared in another major publication that I already have. I could have just re-read the books I already have. This is the last David Sedaris book I will buy. Write some new stories!"
1,The most depressing book or tape,Humor are far in between the dark and depressing view. Whenever those precious humorous gems come along I was already too depressed to be amused. Can't finsih listening to the first side of the first tape.
3,a diVorCe distraction...plus,"onLy ONE person has an existence more tRiviaL than a woMan shunted foR the eternaL 27 YO...poor daviD stuck in his past...& yea, beholde, he has indeed become a fake 27 year olde. [sorry david...not you. i'M talking to myself.]youR travaiLs & traverses seemed more daunting than mine. then.& i needed it. good mediciNei wish i kNew italiaN...."
5,Subtle sarcasm at its finest...,"David Sedaris' ""Holidays On Ice"" has become the gift of choice for several of my friends this year. His smartass writings are full of vivid imagery, and his characters have a real feel to them. I love to flip through a book while in a bookstore, and have it make me laugh within the first few seconds. This book easily accomplished that. Never cruel, his matter-of-fact statements easily dulled the shine of plastic Christmas', but I still appreciated the wit and wisdom he offered in this work. Although I was unfamiliar with his work until this book, I have already ordered his other two books, and look forward to reading them on a cold night in front of a warm fire."
3,Good But Me Talk Pretty One Day is MUCH Better,"The first book I read of Sedaris's was Me Talk Pretty One Day, which was a mistake since I think it is probably the funniest book I have ever read. Holidays On Ice is still a good read, although it pales in comparison. It is funny, and if your family is as twisted as mine, then you could use it as a stocking stuffer. The best essay was clearly the Santaland Diaries, but Six to Eight Black Men was also extraordinarily funny."
5,Great year-round gift...,I enjoyed this immensely and have given it as a gift to a couple of my friends because it makes a great read anytime of year. I think it's better to read it when it's not the holiday season because you appreciate it more when you aren't immersed in your own brand of holiday funk. Thumbs way up.
1,holidays on ice,This was a horrible selection for our book club. I didn't finish it & neither did most of the club. Very bleak & twisted.
2,Not worth reading,This book was not very good. I didn't think it was very funny and the sarcasm was over the top. He tried way to hard when writting this book.
2,entertaining...,"The book was worth reading, even if it's just for the first story, which I really enjoyed. I would say it was the best of the group of stories that was in the book. The others were okay, but not as good."
3,very uneven,"I really enjoyed the Santaland Diarys, but the second story which involves a baby's death is just not funny, and I was offended, but if you like edgy comedy you might like it."
1,"The ""Swiftian essay"" ruins this book.","I am a huge fan of David Sedaris, and bought this as a possibly subversive Xmas gift for several of my friends. However, the story that includes the mindless death of an infant is not strong enough to justify the really shocking events of the story. Hey -- I like biting satire, but this story isn't good enough to carry it off. This one story really ruins the book for me -- it's a pretty crass attempt to shock, and it backfires. Sure, Sedaris has the right to write it, but prospective readers have the right to be warned."
2,"Good Start, but lacking","The Santaland Diaries was quite amusing. However, I did not find the remaining stories engaging."
4,Very Funny,"This book is very funny. I read it a few months ago and there was one story I was not very fond of, hence the 4 stars (instead of 5), but I totally recommend it for the other great stories."
5,Best Christmas Book Ever,"This book is an acerbic look at Christmas through stories that might be true to some extent. The story of parents at Macy's not wanting to send their children to the ""chocolate"" Santa captures so much of how Christmas can really pan out. The fact it's narrated by a man working as an elf makes it all the richer & funnier. The parody of those annoying letters people stick in Christmas cards progresses from ridiculous to unbelievably ridiculous. This would be the best gift for anyone with a good sense of humor who tires of Christmas hype and sentimentality of the Folgers tv commercial variety. I strongly strongly recommend the audiobook version of this book. Nothing will take the sting out of drives for holiday shopping or visits as much as it will."
4,Sedaris' sarcastic humor is right up my alley!,This is the first David Sedaris book I've read and I loved it. The stories had me crying because I was laughing so hard. I didn't laugh as much with the last 2 stories but they still made me chuckle. I really enjoyed Sedaris' sarcastic humor and the way he left me wanting to read more of his books. I plan on buying the rest of his books on my wish list!
2,Nonfiction essays are very good; fiction essays stink,"After a glowing recommendation from my sister, I got this book and have to say I have mixed feelings about it. The (pseudo) non-fiction essays (Santland Diaries and Diana the Christmas Whore) are extremely funny and well worth reading. Unfortunately, the fiction essays are horrible. They are very mean spirited, pessimistic, and well, just not very funny. The satire is laid on thick and shameless, as if he had a bet going to see how absurd and over the top he could make a story. And each one is worse than the next. I was drowning in it. I've heard better reviews about some of his other books, so I'll give those a try. I would never recommend anyone buy this book, but please check it out from your library if just to read those non fiction essays."
4,Biting Holiday Humor,"It certainly does not take long to get through this collection of short stories, and you may even end up with a whole new view of the holidays! Sedaris used biting humor throughout to get his holiday message across. Some of the stories were more ""enjoyable"" than others-- I loved the SantaLand Diaries. The Christmas letter story was harsh but humorous and one based on a true story was over the top. Worth reading if you don't mind a lump of cynicism in your stocking this year!"
4,ho ho ho,"Omigosh, this was one with like a hard ice tea in the middle of the dessert. I thought the conversational essay was dead. Reading Dave is such a treat, he is the kind of guy I should date,polite,observant,with a dark witty, messed up sense of humor.Anyone who has worked in retail during Christmas can relate to The Santaland Diaries. He tells you about the highs and lows of being a christmas elf.Dina the Christmas Whore was a great visual essay and The Christmas Letter was a scream.(although in the most twisted way )The last two are confusing and not worth reading. But other than that its a great book."
4,Worth the price,"Picked this up for $5 at Boarders just before Thanksgiving. Quick, fun read! Prior to Holidays on Ice I'd never read Sedaris. Will definately seek out his other work."
3,Sedaris is a funny guy,"It is hard to pick one set of stars for a book that is full of different essays. I would give some of the essays 4 stars, others 3, and maybe even some 2s. If I look at the book as a whole, I liked it. There are a few stories that stick out -- like Santaland Diaries (about Sedaris' stint as an Elf at Macy's Santaland in NY) and Six to Eight Black Men (about how the Netherlands celebrates Christmas with ""black peters""). All of the stories share Sedaris' wit, and some star people who probably belong on Santa's naughty list. I enjoyed the stories that were about Sedaris and his family more than the ones that were not."
3,The price was dropped on Kindle,Once I had purchased this for $8.99 on Kindle the price dropped to $3.99 so I am not completely satisfied.
1,Very depressing!,"I thought a book with a holiday cover and a title containing the word holiday would be a great one to read during the holidays. Much to my disappointment, it was anything but cheerful. What wasn't depressing and horrifying was tiresome. So much so that I put it down and did not finish it. I am very sorry I spend my money on such a terrible book!"
3,mild,This book was okay. it was a downer for our Christmas book club . This the typical happy Christmas story
2,I would start with another Sedaris title,"I really enjoy David Sedaris. However, this compilation of stories didn't sustain my interest. Partly because I have read some of the stories in other collections, and partly because they just didn't flow together as naturally as his other collections of essays. I liked the theme of the holidays being less than perfection. It wasn't as hillarious and wake your husband up because your laughing out loud as the others."
2,SantaLand Diaries is all it is,"I like David Sedaris and usually find his stuff very funny with that certain twist. The first story - Santaland Diaries was great - the others, not so great. Some were absolutely horrible-- things no one wants to envision during the holidays. Does that make it funny? The others were just plain boring. He could do better. ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" was so much fun to read!"
2,"one good story & five...uh, not so good","I enjoyed the first story about the author's adventures as a department store Christmas Elf. This was a true gem that made the book difficult to put down and I eagerly looked forward to the next 5 tales. Unfortunately, they all fell far short of the expectations laid out by their predecessor. The first story is great, but that fact alone can't hold the remainder of the book, therefore, I cannot recommend it."
4,A mixed bag,"I have never read any by this author before but have heard about him for years. With the Christmas season in full swing and a bit overloaded with ""sweet"" holiday reads, this seemed the perfect tonic. A collection of stories that is largely entertaining, I didn't find them to be absolutely hilarious as others have but I did find them interesting and enjoyable. The first story appears to be the most widely known and relates the experience of working in retail as an elf during the holidays. Anyone who has worked in the retail industry will appreciate it. While I enjoyed most of them tremendously, there was one story that turned my stomach and I wish I had skipped it. The story starts out innocently enough as a parody of the typical, annual Christmas letter distributed by many but it slowly decends into ugly and then takes a turn that was repulsive to me. I wish it had not been included since it spoiled an otherwise good collection of stories.Definitely worth a read with that one exception."
3,Strange,there is a quite a few short stories in this book. some are ok then some i just rather skimmed through. The Santas elf story was the best
5,Wickedly funny! I laughed so hard I cried,"A collection of holiday stories that had me laughing so hard I cried. David Sedaris' dark and twisted sense of humor makes these stories a welcome remedy to holiday stress. In Santaland Diaries, he relates the misadventures of a grown man working as a holiday elf in a department store. The trials of two competitive families whose holiday ""giving"" gets out of control, a holiday letter that goes off the deep end, and a TV producer addressing a congregation of hillbillies, are just a few of the stories that had me laughing until my sides hurt. Wickedly funny!"
4,Great Christmas Read,"I read this every few years at Christmas for a good laugh between shopping excursions. A light, easy read. Quirky look at ""traditions""."
4,Delightfully dark and sarcastic.,This is a quick and enjoyable read. I found it very refreshing in that it isn't just another feel-good holiday book.
5,Never disappoints.,David Sedaris is great! This was purchased for a long driving trip and made time pass quickly. Would definitely recommend this!
2,Don't get it,"I was not familiar with David Sedaris' humor, and turns out it's not really my style. I did find the first short story interesting, but the rest of the book was boring and/or I didn't get it. Why did he puplish this book? It must be popular, as this is a new version with more stories that the prior edition.I guess you have to be a Sedaris fan for this one."
3,"uneven, ranging from hiliarious to tiresome","Sedaris is indeed at his best with non-fiction. ""Santaland Diaries"" is terrific, and ""Dinah the Christmas Whore"" is very good. The fiction pieces, however, are all weak, repetitive, and overlong; ""Seasons' Greetings"" in particular is painful to listen to, and mean-spirited in a way that none of the other pieces are."
2,From Delight to Disgust,"This book goes from being brilliant in Santaland Diaries (hence the 2 stars) to being offensive against minorities to being simply disgusting and appalling: children being raped and murdered. During his ""delightful"" trek through the holidays, one baby dies after being thrown into the dryer, and two other children are given away and found raped and murdered. And this is funny?"
3,WAY overrated,"I loved The Santaland Diaries and made a fool of myself laughing out loud reading it on the bus to work. That said, however, there is nothing funny about a baby dying in a washing machine. That ""story"" tainted the rest of the book for me."
5,Laugh out Loud,While I have found the books by David Sedaris funny his deanpan delivery on the tapes ads a whole new dimension. His way of turning a simple subject such as trying to ask a butcher for meat in French or getting some remodling done are turned into hilariously insiteful tales due to his attention to detail and wonderful ability to mine for the ridiculous in almost any situation. His books have kept me awake at night laughing and this CD made me wish my morning commute was longer so I could hear it all at once. He has many imitators but is still the best.
1,Too dark for my taste,"Huge disappointment. I have read three David Sedaris books previously and had found them laugh-out-loud funny. ""Holidays on Ice"" nearly ended up in the fireplace when I hit a particularly dark chapter. His humor has always been on the sarcastic side, which generally appeals to me, but I didn't find this book amusing. If I want to be horrified, I'll read Dean Koontz."
4,the clone war has begun,"This game cosely follows the movie better than any game I've played but there are some improvements that could of been made. First of all its to short,the levels and bosse are easy,and they could've made more levels.For the levels they could've of made the levels more maze like but the rooftop,kamino,and paths of geonosis are fine.They might've been able to add a level where you have to make it to padme befor she gets poisened plus it would've been better if they made a level when you have to survive the three beast.But it is a fun game and is worth playing and I like to start a new game and see how long it takes to beat it and did I mention that theres no limit to how many games you can save."
3,Graphics Are Good,"As the title says, great graphics. But beyond that, the controls are a little goofy and feels like I am playing a Tiger LCD handheld. (google it those under 25). Granted I don't play a lot of gba games, but of those I have, this falls below the rest. These are just my first impressions of the game. I will write another review after I complete the game."
2,I did not enjoy this game.,"I am a die hard Star Wars fan, this game is an abomination of the Star Wars franchise. I bought this game about the same time that the movie came out, and i was seriously let down. The entire game is a side scroller that is loosely based on the movie. Even the music seems as though John Williams had nothing to do with it. On the back it said you could choose your Jedi, but when I started Playing I did not have a choice. Also the inability to save just added to the over all let down of this game. I am saying this as a fan do not buy this game."
4,RIGHT GAME/RIGHT PRICE,MY GRANDSON REALLY ENJOYS THIS. AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT! WHAT MORE COULD ANYONE WANT?
2,Only for die hard gamers,"If you aren't a die hard gamer this game is likey not for you.The controls in side scrolling lightsaber mode are complicated and non-intuitive. Example: Stop moving, press the A (attack) button first, _THEN_ the direction pad to direct your attack. With most games its simply attack in the direction you are moving. While this may be life in the real world (""uh oh, I better get ready to fight, Attack, Go for the chest"") it doesn't work so well in this game where the goal is to move to the end of the level.I didn't find the graphics to be all that impressive. It's pretty hard to well show lots of detail on the small GBA screen.Honestly, take this game on a ""test drive"" (find a friend) before you shell out the hard earned dollars for it -- unless you're hardcore..."
2,The force is a bit disappointing with this one.,"In a nutshell, its too easy and has bad graphics. Episode I has better game play and control, which made this all the more disappointing. And unless if im missing something, you cant use your force powers against Dooku, he always counteracted before i got to pull them off. I defeated him by pressing one button over and over again. Wheres the challenge?"
1,I did not enjoy this game,"Don't get me wrong I am a diehard Star Wars fan, yet to me this game was a huge suckfest. The side scrolling adventure and the horrible graphics further retard the game. The music sounds as if John Williams had no role in it. The story line (if any) to the movie was no where nearly followed, and the title cards that explain the plot bored me into into oblivian. I also did not enjoy the fact that if I got to Level 9 and felt like stopping I would lose all of data from before. I even tried to write down all of the pass codes, but by the time i was done playing and writing my batteries had died. This was just another example of Lucas Arts trying to milk the Star Wars franchise. The game was horrible and not even worth the lint in my pocket."
2,very bad game,This game is horrible! the graphics are bad and the controlls are stupid.But the worst thing about this game is the sound.DO NOT get this game!
4,Star Wars Attack of the Clones,"This game is a pretty cool game because There is 11 levels play as Mace Windu, Obi Wan Kenobi , and Anakin Skywalker. I would rate the gameplay about 6 1/2 the graphics about a 8 for the Gameboy Advance. I beat the game in about 3 days but I still Play it The bad part about this game is it is very repetive but it is still pretty fun."
4,Good,"Really not a 4 star but a 3.5 star. It has some good gameplay, but having to write down all those passwords is hard. In one of the levels my GBA went crazy and everything got screwed up! Other than that its an ok game."
4,very cool !!!,This game is great.The graphics are awsome but the game is a littel short.There is only 11 stages and you can beat count dooko with simple combos. The game is hard but you will have lots of fun with it.
2,Wait for the other versions!!!,"The game is Starwars that's good but the rest is bad lame graphics,difficult controls,lacks fun. i really gave this a 2 because it's Starwars if this game is like Jedi Outcast I gave this a 5 stars why did Lucasarts didn't develop this game?"
3,"This release is missing best song, ""Once in a blue moon""","Apparently, this first release is missing the song ""Once in a blue moon"" performed by Sydney Forrest. The second release, not sold here, has an additional 3 tracks and does include the aforementioned song. Come on Amazon.com, get the second release."
3,Incomplete Soundtrack,"After seeing the movie, I wanted to own the soundtrack to ""Simply Irresistible."" Unfortunately, two of the major reasons I chose to purchase the CD were not realized: The CD does not contain Shawn Colvin's ""Every Little Thing (He) Does Is Magic"" which is only found on her 1995 album ""Cover Girl"". Nor can you get Jennfier Paige's ""Crush"" which plays in the movie trailer. The rest of the music is fine, but two critical tracks are ommitted."
1,The best is missing,"""Everything She Does Is Magic"" is missing from the soundtrack. Who performed this old ""Police"" tune and where can I get it?"
3,Missing best song ! Where can I get it? --- EDITED,"I am very disappointed that this CD is missing ""Once in a Blue Moon"" by Sydney Forrest. It was the main reason I wanted the CD, and in fact, am looking for this song. Does anyone know where it is available?Apparently the soundtrack was reissued adding this song."
3,Nice mixture of squish squish music.,"Good CD, but the CD should have contained the SCORE and ONCE IN A BLUE MOON. That was the main LOVE song for me. It's unfortunate when the use of a song in the movie is NOT included in the ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK, when the label says ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK."
2,Disappointed,"For me, the best selection on the Cd was the version of 'That Old Black Magic'. I was disappointed that only half the song is included. Does anyone know the name fo the group accompanying Jessica on 'That Old Black Magic'? I would love to find more music by this group."
4,lovely,"If your into loud music this is not the CD for you. Like the movie(Which I loved), the music fits the mood of the movie. A combine of old songs and new songs helps you enjoy the CD on a quite evening."
5,Action and Romance,"Not so old movie ; with nice pictures, very good sound, excellent scenario (and, I suppose, some useful indications by our (lovely, elsewhere) Sondra Locke) ; perfect Theresa Russell, also atmosphere, danger and action... even the not perfect but courageous strong cop ...But, as a Frenchman, I'am sorry for one thing : not subtitle, neither English nor French. I do have an old french VHS ... it helps ! Indeed, in that precious collection, with treasures, please, it will be a good thing adding subtitles, or some foreign languages ... first of all...the French one !"
1,Mauriat should have just retired.,"Obviously composed, arranged, and performed by someone ready to retire. He didn't even include the original released version of ""Love is Blue"" that propelled him to international fame. I regret wasting my money on this CD. Look for a remastered original release if you want to hear something satisfying to the ear."
1,Terrible book...How do I get my money back?,"If you expect an intillegent and philosophical examination of one of the pillars of Islam: Salat, this is not the book to read. This is pure Da'wa material. I just wonder who is paying for publishing this terrible book? I do want my money back."
4,Black Metal Behemoth at their Bloody Best,"If you're a Behemoth fan, you know that they morphed from a raw black metal band into a polished black metal band and then into a sick death metal incarnation. What we have here is a collection of Polands best playing early, very-DIY sounding musick that's a treat for all fans of early Emperor, Hellhammer, Mayhem, Beherit and Enslaved (to name but a few). Demonica is a collection of hard to find stuff and it's all fairly rough but well done considering they likely had no budget and were teenagers in the early 90s.Included amidst the maelstrom are two new re-recordings of old Behemoth tracks done by the present DM incarnation. These tracks are great but are somewhat OTT next to the low budget gems on the rest of the two CDs. Overall though, this is a box full of stellad dark gems that all fans of necro black metal need."
2,It's Okay....,"But it makes the most annoying clicky sound when it plays!!! It drives me nuts. ""tick tick tick"" when it plays, it is especially annoying in the parts of movies when it gets quiet! I don't really reccomend this VCR- even though it is nice looking!"
2,GE VG4270 does not have VCR Plus,"""VCR +"" is included in the list of features (on this web site) for the GE VG4270 4-head hi-fi VCR. However, the ""GE VG4270 Four Head Hi-Fi Video Cassette Recorder"" which I bought on July 8 does not have VCR Plus. There is no mention of VCR Plus in the GE VG4270 User's Guide, and VCR Plus does not appear on any of the GE VG4270 VCR's menus.I had called the manufacturer (Thompson Conumer Electronics) for pre-purchase information, and they said that the GE VG4270 is not yet in Thomson Product Support's computer. Thomson has manufactured GE models with VCR Plus, such as the GE VG4054 4-head VCR."
3,review of Remington shaver,The Remingtomn was purchased at Amazon. It was shipped rapidly and as odered. The razor is an inexpensive model and does a good job. Model number SF-3 is a single ricipricating micro screen unit. This is the second one I've had. It gave good close shaves. The trimer extention never held up and couldn't be used after a short time. The replacement screens are exorbanently priced and not available in local stores. by.Remington MicroScreen SF-3 Electric Cordless Shaver
2,Broke after light use,This is one of my favorite type of shavers but this one broke after light use. They are hard to find but I wish they lasted longer.
2,"Not as good as older, 3-head cutter models","The SF-3, which has a single-head cutter, is OK for light beards, but not for heavy or 2-day beards, and I found the trimmer to be almost useless for cutting longer hairs. The older models ,eg, SM3 2700, have a 3-head cutter and a 2-position trimmer that could be used by itself for sideburns and longer stray hairs, or in conjunction with the cutter, which is very effective in shaving, say, a heavy beard or a beard of 2 days growth. Of course, the older models are more expensive to manufacture. It is unfortunate that corporations are willing to make inferior products to maximize profits. Such is life in a faltering economy..."
3,Mixed Review,"Let me say that I loved this shaver since it makes it easy to do around beards etc with it's small single foil. Problem is, they don't always run properly. I've had two that did exactly the same thing. Sometimes they run fine, other times they run very very slowly like the battery is dead (but it's not). All my attempts to figure out what was wrong failed. In the end I just had to ditch them and buy a Panasonic. I still like the smaller foil of the SF3 better, but I just couldn't rely on it to work when I need it."
5,scoldees-nitecap world,"excellent band! Nancy sirianni's vocals remind me of jane siberry. They are masters of many styles. No bad tracks, and the lead song 'cocoon' has become one of my favorite songs. It's heartbreakingly beautiful."
4,Will Always Be a Classic Horror,"Well, this is not the drum I march to. Nevertheless, this is an interesting piece of literature. H.G. Wells does a very good job of creating images. He also manages to offer us suspense, comedy, drama, and chills. One thing he does very well is that he grabs our attention in the 2nd half by revealing the identity of the invisible man along with his background. Perhaps the worst I can say about this book is that I enjoyed the movie with Claude Rains better."
3,I can't believe I read the whole thing,It moves so slow. And I mean slow. It'd take a page for a modern author to write what it took Wells ten to do. It's not so much scary as it is eerie. There's some cool stuff in this book. Being invisible did get freakier than you'd think. And I liked Griffin. Be prepared with a good vocabulary to read this book. It's unnecessarily wordy science fiction stuff.
3,Sort of interesting...,"I think I expected too much from this book and was therefore disappointed with it. It was an interesting account of Griffin's follies, but it wasn't as eerie as I had thought it would be. If you're into sci-fi you should read it, otherwise...well, it's up to you."
4,Entertaining and quite funny!,"This novel, science fiction, is quite entertaining and holds your interest right to the end. Written in the late nineteenth century is gives you a snapshot of an English village during that period."
3,an interesting read,"I had heard about the Invisible Man all of my life, but had never read the book. WHen I finally did, I felt glad that I did. The story was good, but I think the pace was a bit slow. Wells seems to allow the pace to bog down in the early portion of the book, and when reading, if you're not careful, you might even be tempted to abandon the book and never finish reading it. However, finishing the book was worth it and now I know why the story is remembered."
5,One of the Best,"This novel, is by all means, a classic. It tells the story of a brilliant scientist, who goes raving mad after turning himself invisible. At first he is just secretive and only wishes to be left alone, to complete his work, and become visible again. But the residents of the town of Iping are too curious for their own good, and the formula begins to take a negative effect on the Invisible Man. This story has inspired many movies, starting off with the 1933 classic, and working it's way up to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I strongly reccomend H.G. Wells'The Invisible Man, to any H.G. Wells fan or science fiction reader."
2,jmal book review,This book was a very interesting . It had you suspenced and at the edge of your seat. It had you thinkiing what would you do if you were really invisible .What kind of chaos would ypu stir up. This book was good but it started to get a little boring . That's why I gave it only 3 stars. the movies was much better .
1,Not nearly as good as I thought it would be...,"The Invisible Man, granted, was written in a completely different era, maybe that is why I really did not enjoy it, or maybe it was the fact that it was just pointless. This book was basically about trying to find the Invisible Man. I cannot think of something in this book that intrigued me really in any way. I would NOT recommend this book!"
1,Yawn!!,"This book was quite boring and didn't make sense in many portions of the book. I was quite disturbed by the inconsistant flow of the book, quite irritating."
4,One of Wells' Best,"The Invisible Man was a very good, descriptive piece of literature. It had well described fight scenes and scenery. It is one of H.G.Wells' best books.The Invisible Man is about a scientist, named Griffin, who turns himself invisible through a stroke of scientific genius. The only problem is that Griffin doesn't know how to make himself visible again. Though the Invisible Man tries to hide himself in public by wearing bandages all over his body and claiming he was in a bad accident, he is found out anyway. After a while, the Invisible Man goes crazy because of nobody accepting him, people double-crossing him, and his possessions being stolen. He becomes a murderer and tries to become a dictator of a town in the book because he is so powerful."
5,Good read,"This is an old classic - but very interesting. Wells was the ""father"" of this type of fiction. I also recently read his ""Time machine"""
4,That guy you love to hate,"The invisible man is a big, fat jerk. He is the villain you love to hate. As I was reading this book I started out sympathizing with him and his impossible situation only to become more and more horrified and disgusted. Despite my abhorrence of the main character I found myself fascinated by his story. He is both practical and fanatic, a genius with enough character flaws to add real depth to his character. I highly recommend this book."
3,Interesting premise ...,The premise was fascinating; who wouldn't want to be invisible at times? The first chapters were fun to read ... Then it was just silly.
4,A great read even better on the Kindle,This was a great read when I was in school and now is evn better on the Kinidle.
5,"Great Book, Don't Be Confused...",Don't confuse this book with the piece of trash written by Ralph Ellison called The Invisible Man. This is another masterpiece from Wells.
4,A simple story filled with poignant social commentary,"This is a quick and easy read that should be enjoyed by readers of all ages. On the surface, an adventurous story of a disgruntled mad scientist whose experiment succeeds tremendously but leads to unanticipated difficulties, and his struggles to find a place in a world that he no longer fits in. Deeper, this book represents a poignant social commentary by Wells. Is it society's distrust and misunderstanding that lead to the Invisible Man's madness? Are these the inevitable outcomes of tinkering with nature? Would most people loose all sense of right and wrong without being observed by others? What makes it so hard for society to accept someone different? There are plenty of rather deep questions to keep in mind when reading this simple-seeming novel.However you read it, this is an interesting and entertaining read that will stick with you long after you've finished it. Take the little time it takes to read this classic. Highly recommended."
4,A good read,"This is one of those books you can read two ways. You can read it for fun as a great story, or you can get all English Major on it and beat every last drop of fun out of it analyzing the hidden meanings, subtexts, and philosophy of the thing.I read it mostly as a a fun story, and it is that. It had my attention throughout the whole of it. Here's something about Wells: he writes the best pandemonium scenes. Ever. There's one in here that makes you feel for the people that don't know what to do, and at the same time you can't help laughing at the whole thing.If you want to get a little deeper, the main character comes off as rather endearing at first -- and maybe not so much later on. I think we all might wonder what we'd do in his shoes, and hope not the same things.It's a good read and well worth the time."
4,Unexpected,"After reading The Time Machine, I was very keen to read more H. G. Wells. I did not expect The Invisible Man to be about a murderous psychopath, however. The novel is very interesting in regard to human nature and is written in a way that stimulates the emotions. I enjoyed the read."
3,The Invisible Man,"Although this is a period piece of literature, and the usual surnames used as methods of identity, the book in general was a bit too outlandishI have seen many series on TV many years but they had the Hollywood license to keep the viewer entertained"
3,This book was intersting!,"This story was about an interesting topic. It was cool that the man turned himself invisible. I thought that if you were invisible, you could go through walls, doors, etc. but when I read this story, I learned that you can't. But the story of this book was kinda boring. I think the author should have written this story more vividly so I could of liked this book better. Steven Yum, ASI"
3,"Very good,but probably not H.G. Wells best...","When the movie ""Hollow Man"" camed along, i thought it was going to be a modernized version of this book, so then i started reading it, this books it's very thrilling, smart, entertaining and suspenful, but this book didn't have to be that long, H.G. tries to make a long short story, but it would be a better book, if it cutted all those senseless chapters,also if he made a better descrpiption of what is he telling, it would be a better book, i give three and a half stars, because it feels just like if you are in there, and because it really has a very strong suspense and terror, but you rather read other H.G. Wells book such as ""The Time Machine""."
3,science fiction.huh,"This is a small novel . is it worth reading? yes!It is a bout a man who becomes invisible with subsequent struggle with the normal sorrounding society around...The events of the story are predictable since many books and movies were made in this field of invisibility,however;the fact that this was published in 1897 is ASTONISHING. the book is easy read."
1,"Warning: This is a COMIC BOOK, not the classic novel","Contrary to what you see in the image of this book, it is NOT the classic novel by H.G. Wells.It is a COMIC BOOK, adapted from the original by Sean Taylor.If what you're looking for is a comic book adaptation of HG Wells, this is the book for you.However, don't be fooled when you see that the book is called ""The Invisible Man"" and that the author is HG Wells."
3,a kid's review,"By turning himself invisible, Griffin, of University College, raises himself above everyone else by removing himself from the social forum.The story uses the mad scientist scenario to explore the shunning or embracing of community."
4,An Intriguing Look into a Fascinating Concept,"The Invisible man depicts the story of a 19th century scientist who manages to find the secret of invisibility, an idea so intriguing near everyone has pondered the ramifications of such an idea at least once. Written in the late 1800s, the story suffers from none of the expected short comings one might expect in a book based heavily on science; a testament to the quality of Well's writing.The story deals both with the intricacies of what it would mean to be invisible as well as the inner turmoil suffered by the protagonist as he discovers the unexpected downsides of moving through life unseen. I expect any admirer of science fiction will find enjoyment in this short yet intriguing story which easily rates among Well's best."
3,An Imposible story.,"This Scientific novel in spite of the fact of being very emotional from the beginning to the end is based on impossible realism, because a human being needs red corpuscle (red blood cells) to subsist. Without a doubt the good coordination and imagination of the writer transports the reader to a false reality that could see through in suspense and curiosity. The narrative capacity of Wells, The characterization of the actors in time, place and space give this novel a high rating for this type of scientific novels. Even though this novel was written more than one hundred years ago (1897) is consider a classic in science fiction. This novel also has a lesson for the present generation for which consequences should be measured and the possible results before making experiments with the unknown."
3,Slow,"This was a fairly slow story. It had some very interesting sections, and I enjoyed it over all. I expected a bit more action, or something, wasn't really sure as I'd never read this in the past, nor heard any spoilers!"
3,The Invisible Man,This classical novel has a good storyline but within its explanations can often be confusing to the reader. None the less it is one that provides an interesting story.
4,The invisible man,An excellent book demonstrating getting what you wished for isn't always best. The plot is extremely easy to understand a must read in my eyes.
5,The Invisible Man,Cool and Mysterious! I loved it! This one of the most exciting books I've ever read! A work of genius! With a chilling and exciting ending.
2,Too hard to control,"I find this game to be very frustrating. The slightest touch of the controller sends the characters flying off the race track. I tried it with a steering wheel with no better results. I can't do it, let alone my 5 year old."
2,My kids thought it was OK but .....,I thought it [stunk]. How can a game that has to be played on a 250 dollar machine be so far behind with graphics? OK if you are 6 years old.
3,Misleading on the characters,"... I saw it on amazon and wanted it because I am a huge fan of Taz and saw that he was in the game. But when my wife and I played it, neither of us could find Taz and I was very disappointed with that finding. I still enjoy the game, but on the other hand, I am upset that they mentioned Taz being in the game, and he wasn't."
1,Identity Crisis,"These early Palmer efforts (with the exception of the debut cd)simply leave me bored. They seem to flounder with very little zip. This is my least favorite of all his cd's as it's the only one I sold on Ebay. The songs as written do not have a point and Palmer in these days is still searching for his identity. If you are looking for great Palmer try, Don't Explain, Honey, Heavy Nova or even his debut cd. Stay away from this cd while driving as it may cause drowsiness."
2,Buy essential oil instead!,"I LOVE the smell of patchouli! Takes me right back to the sixties! I use it in soaps and oils that I make at home, and thought I would try this as a perfume oil for my body. It smells good when you sniff it, but after being on for a while, smells NOTHING like it did out of the bottle. Mamy reviews for this brand of perfume oil used the word ""stink,"" I'm afraid I must concur..."
5,I love this book.,"I'm no scholar, just an ameteur musician and early music enthusiast. I love this book. The tunes are set in easy to play keys and notated much more sensibly than other arrangments I've seen. His endnotes are also pretty good, of course more information and commentary on each piece is always welcome. The sprial binding also makes it easy to use and perform from."
2,good but needs base,"Overall works great, but the bottom relies entirely on the width of the AA battery to make contact. So, if you have a flashlight or other device with a spring at the bottom, many are wider than the width of a AA battery and don't make contact with the AA battery base. Some other AA to D converters have a plate on the bottom of the case to make it the width of a regular D battery that the bottom of the AA battery would contact, hence making good contact regardless of the contact method in the device you are using them in."
5,What a great idea!,II love the idea of using AA rechargeable batteries in a D cell format. The manufacturer should make it clear that you get four adapters!
2,Works if battery wrapper can seat properly.,They are physically squirrelly and may or may not work in the target device depending on weather they get a good seat.
2,Works... kind of,"Yes, it technically works; however, the design is so poor that you have to reseat the batteries about a dozen times to get them to line up and work.Also, the little snaps that hold the AA into the casing don't fit well and some have already broken off. Friction is the only thing really keeping these together and working and that sometimes just isn't enough.I will try another brand next time. Perhaps they're all like this though, I have no idea.Bottom line: They are cheap and they do work. I honestly hope there are better options out there though."
3,3 out of 4 not bad,"I bought 4 of these to utilize aa batteries in lanterns. One of the four adapters does not lock the aa battery in, causing it to slide in and out. The other three work flawlessly and do exactly what I bought them for."
3,ITS OK,THIS HERE IS OK NOT THE BEST OR GOOD ONE BUT ITS OK ..THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE ABOUT THIS IS THE BOTTOM IS OEN SO IT COMES OUT OR SLIPS OUT WITH NOT CLOSED OR WAIT NO WONDER THERE IS NO BACK COVER LOL...BUT IT STILL WORKS
4,Good Substitute,These work well with the Sanyo Eneloop Rechargeable AA Batteries. I use these as a get by when taking my portable stereo outside away from a wall plug. The radio last several hours with AA cells. I recharge the AA in a Powerex MH-C800S charger. Saves a lot of money over disposable D batteries.
3,Pretty good but check the negative contact,These are pretty good adapters. You slide the battery in positive side first and it clicks into place. The positive terminal of the battery contacts a metal tip that lengthens the battery since D's are longer than AA's. The only problem is that they depend on the negative end of the AA to make contact. I tried them in a Mag-Light and the spring for the negative contact just slid right over the AA battery without making contact. I was able to put a coin over the spring to make it work. They should really make these to fill in the length on the negative side with a big metal base.
2,works for most people but not me,"the bottom of the adapter uses the bottom of the battery, and is some devices what use a spring on the bottom of the adapter do not work because the spring slips into the area between the battery and battery adapter."
4,Good in a pinch,I wouldn't use these all the time but they are very handy to have when you don't have the right size battery. They are definitely great to have in a pinch! I just make sure I get the right size battery ASAP as an AA battery doesn't last long in something that needs a D.
4,Understandable Help,S. D. Gordon's writings are as pertinent today as they were a hundred years ago. He has captured the timeless step by step instructions from the scriptures on how to live a powerful life to accurately represent the Lord in the earth today. He reaches into the scriptures and brings to life the scenes that illustrate his simple but profound lessons. I highly recommend this book and his others for anyone interested in a deeper understanding of inner life in the Spirit.
3,My review,"The game starts of with a word diolog. It tells that arnold has to save the naborhood. To save the game, it is really stupid. You have to remember a password with a mix of letters, numbers, and symblols. It is hard to remember unless you wright it down on a piece of paper but you have to bring the paper with you if you want to play the game from where you currently left off.The actual game playing is fun. The only part I do not like is having to remember the password."
3,A bit too 70-ish for my taste,"If you don't think Herbie Hancock looked ridiculous in his disco phase, than you might very well enjoy this album... However, although it's not even nearly as dated (and commercially oriented) as some of the 70s recordings by some jazz artists (and former jazz artists) this is quite a disappointment for me...Although, when I read on the back-cover of the cd that Tommy Flanagan plays various keyboards in addition to piano, that should have warned me... But this amount of brilliant musicians (Johnson, Henderson, Flanagan...) on the same album really raised my expectations, so maybe I'm a bit too harsh... The fact that album is not strictly a jazz recording doesn't necessarily mean it's not good music, but I felt a need to share my feelings, however personal they might be.Be warned! This is a period piece, not recommendable to jazz purists."
4,great cd overall,"For the trance enthusiasts, this cd is a wonderful cd to add to your collection. Featuring names such as GiGi D'Agostino, Delerium, Blank & Jones, Azzido Da Bass, etc! Wonderful selection of uplifting tracks for your musical soul. Although most of the tracks may be short cut mixes due to the high volume of songs on each cd (20), they do not lose their credibility to move your body! The compilation could have been better had all the songs been continuously mixed, nevertheless, this is well worth the price for an imported cd!!!"
1,Oops!,"I accidently bought this CD, thinking that it was the same new-age-y Soulfood that brought us Breathe. Oh contraire, definitely not the same bunch! The two groups are nothing alike. It's not my sort of thing, so I'm rating it 1 star. But if you are into head banging funk you might enjoy it."
1,Waste of time,"This book has dumb dialogue and so few pictures it's a shame to call it a design oriented book. The swell line is adorable and I believed this book to be something that would play off of that. It did not. It had absurd ideas, bland drawing, boring writing, stupid stories and little reference to anything related to interior design or the swell line. DISAPPOINTING. Don't waste any money or time on this book."
2,not so great,I was expecting more. For some reason I felt like this book would be more exciting and have better information. I was dissappointed. There is a book called Super Suite for teens that I really loved and they were positioned right next to each other in my book store. I opted for the teen book!
4,Unrealistic but still fun and inspiring,"Sure I wouldn't saw a hole in my wall, but this book was a fun read and it was inspiring. But more in the- remember to look at things in unexpected and new ways. Don't actually expect to get any specific decorating ideas here."
1,A MAJOR RIP-OFF,"Not only is this book small in size and number of pages, but it's a rehash of ideas that are NOTHING NEW. Simply putting the (tacky) ""swell"" label on this is not enough to make it worth the money. I kept looking for a new idea that I hadn't seen in all the decorating magazines and books I buy, but there wasn't a fresh thought in here. A case of trying to market a superficial concept without putting any thought or quality behind it. I'm tired of being ripped off in this way."
1,A ....,This book doesn't contain very many pages. It also doesn't contain very many ideas. The ideas the book does have are old hat. And who are Cynthia Rowly and Irene Rozenweig?
3,dvd,"great teaching tool as long as you don't get bored with it , son got bored recommend this to people who want to learn how to dance"
1,Only for the Kids,I watched this video and was totally disappointed for the fact that it was too basic and it didn't even have any real dance routines at all. The best part of the video was probably the baby freeze demo which I already have on another dvd.. this dvd is for young kids just learning to dance and thats it.. not worth my money at all.
5,I'm impressed!,"I have developed pretty low expectations for hip-hop dance videos, as so many of them seem to be produced in a garage or with production value like they're from the 70s or something. But this one is different. You will definitely be able to learn from this video as it is broken down quite well.This is in my 3 favorite hip-hop instructional videos. This one is better for club dancing. For poplocking, check outHow To Do The Robot - Breakdance Instructional DVDand for breakdancing, check outTop 20 Breakdance Moves.good luck!"
1,R U Serious??????,"I purchased this DVD based on reviews i read. I don't know what you guys were thinking. Kelly Peters should be ashamed of himself for ripping of customers with this bootleg DVD. This is volume 1, next cabbage patch on volume 2 LOL. You learn NOTHING from this video. Its a rip off. This DVD is beyond Basic, its about 5 steps back before basics. The ""special features"" is a joke. Best thing about the DVD is the cover.You can download better stuff of the net for FREE!!!I usually trust ratings but this time I was in for an upset.Reader trust me, this DVD is poor bootleg quality. NOt only do i want my money back but i refuse to allow Kelly Peters to get rich by ripping of paying customers.Have a nice day :)"
1,Horrible,"This video is a joke. If you want to learn some real choreography or dance steps, don't expect to get it from this video. It just shows you a bunch of pelvic thrust and really corny moves that would get you laughed at if you attempted to do it on the dance floor. This video is for people who have no knowledge of Hip-Hop. Please spare me the close-up of the pelvic thrust... You would get a good laugh but it's a waste of money. I very much regret of getting it."
1,Who cares?,"Why on earth would I or anyone else read this? Who cares?The author is from California, which is damning enough on its own, but that he actually cares about this subject is doubly so. How can anyone take Rolling Stone seriously either, for that matter?""Most rock journalism is people who can't write, interviewing people who can't talk, for people who can't read.""How does crap like this get published?I see copies can be had for 1 cent. It can't be worth even that.He probably likes French film, too."
3,"Sorry to be the dissenting voice, but","I find this recording to be flaccid. I believe Evans needed a strong rhythm section to keep him from degenerating into cocktail hour playing. Sure, it's pretty, and makes a good choice to play in the background at a dinner party, but it is not the most compelling Evans around. Try any of the recordings with Lafaro and Motian first."
4,Tatum+Evans+Peterson = Bernard Peiffer,"While all of Bill Evans recorded material is a great statement in Jazz, there's an unknown giant many of you do not know of and his name is Bernard Peiffer.Don't believe me...very well.Google his name and see the resurgence that is now available on CD, (for the 1st time ever) entitled ""Formidable...!"" Check out All About Jazz.com as well and search under Bernard Peiffer. You'll be very happy you did.He was as talented as a pianist as any you may name...so said Leonard Feather and Barry Ulanov to name only 2 historians who knew of this phenom pianist.Also check out: www.bernardpeiffer.com"
5,You have to get this!,"If you're a fan of Crazytown, you'll love the smooth sounds of this CD. This CD provides a insight into a changed man, and his views on life. EXCELLENT BUY!! You'll find yourself playing it over and over and over..."
3,"Crazy town... oops, I mean Shifty","I was instantly hooked to ""Slide along side"" when I heard it on the radio.. than I bought the CD, thinking that it would be OK. ALL of the songs on this album sound the same, which is actually the COMPLETE opposite of having ""No boundaries"".... It's FINE if you like boy bands/pop, but, alas, it is just Crazy town slapped with the name Shifty. And believe me, selling 3 Million albums world wide isnt something to brag about."
2,Hoppe's S 10 Crosshair Target,The product received did not match the product shown. Apparently Hoppes has changed from using all orange ink to only using orange for the large center target. The image shown by Amazon and the vendor should be updated to show the correct product.The black lines and the black secondary targets in the corners make this product less useful than the previous model with all orange print.
3,Good Enough,"Not the Best, But it'd fine.The song, (There Once was an engine who ran away) should be on the video Thomas and the Really Brave Engines. Includes Season 7 episodes, first appearence of Fergus and narration by Michael Brandon.In ""percy gets it right"",(Not Percy saves the day) Thomas ignores Percy's warning of a wobbly track on Toby's branchline.Also includes: Something fishy, what's the matter with henry?, old bridge, trusty rusty and Bill,Ben and Fergus."
3,"Great Game, Pretty Good Graphics and Horrible Tricks!","This is a great game except for the tricks. Hart attack, suicide flip??? How about back-flip and front-flip! Some tricks are to tough to do like ""tap"" or ""press"" or ""hold"". Can't they just have the tricks like Tony Hawk, where it's a direction then a button! To hard to see on a dark course. Great game otherwise. Mini-Games are awesome. Don't bother buying this game. Buy MX2002, MX Superfly or Jeremy McGrath Supercross. You may want to rent this game to just check it out though."
4,An early preview of Stan's late style,"Stan Getz started out Cool and dry, in the late 40's and early 50's with wonderful ballad technique, but not as much feeling & emotion as his masterworks in the eighties.Amazingly enough, in this early Stan Getz album, Stan the Man sounds not like his other fifties albums, not like the Bossa Nova or Fusion Stan, but much like his mature style 30+ years later, in his last decade, his greatest era.Well recorded for the time, in mono, but the Sound is glorious. Compare this to ""Bossas and Ballads"" recorded near the end of his life to see what I mean!""Stella by StarLight"", ""Nobody Else but Me"", ""Tis Autumn"" and ""Body and Soul"" are particularly nice.early Getz to own!Stan Getz is always the best choice for both Jazz aficionados and those novices completely new to the form. There will never be another sax player this good.This really is one of the ten best Getz albums of all time, done before he became really popular."
5,More of a challenge than you'd think.,"I purchased Pure Barre 16th Street more out of curiosity than anything else. I have been doing Barre/Fusion workouts for the past year or so and thought that the 35 minute Pure Barre workout would be good for days on which I couldn't commit a full hour to working out. The Pure Barre workout is surprisingly challenging. I began doing Pure Barre just as I also was beginning a low carbohydrate diet, so when I found the Pure Barre workout to be more of a challenge than I was used to, I attributed it to the lower energy that usually accompanies the early days of low carb eating. I no longer think that was the case. When I went back to doing my other Barre/Fusion workouts after doing the Pure Barre series for a couple of weeks, I found those other workouts to be easier for me than they had been before. So despite its shorter length, I think the Pure Barre workout is challenging and worth adding to your workout rotation."
4,grimm,"it's confusing because to most people Grime means MC's shouting in thick hackney accents, while this is industrialized dubstep robot-zombies from Croydon stepping up to a first collection of instrumental breakbeats somewhere between garage, hiphop, drum'n'bass, electro, and 2-step. dark and menacing, brutal and ominous, if you like this stuff check DJ Hatcha's Dubstep Allstars Vol. 1 and 2 on Tempa records. (...)"
4,The grass is bluer...,"This follow-up to ""The Grass is Blue"" should please just about anyone who likes country or bluegrass music. Dolly's in fine voice here, and her instrumental accompanists are among the best in the business (including Chris Thile of Nickel Creek,Bryan Sutton of Ricky Skaggs' Kentucky Thunder, Barry Bales of Alison Kraus' Union Station, among others). I had a bit of a problem with the song selection - the 'straight' country/bluegrass tracks were, to me, the strongest on the record; original versions of the 'crossover' tracks (like The Eagles ""Seven Bridges Road"" and Cole Porter's ""I Get a Kick Out of You"") are so firmly stamped on my ear that they suffered in comparison - admittedly a personal crisicism.Still, this is quite a fine recording by an exceptional artist capable of crossing genres with the best of them. Dolly's plaintive vocals on ""A Tender Lie"" will buckle your knees, and her mountain-girl energy on ""Marry Me"" will pick you right back up. Impressive."
1,Only For Jed and Granny,"I like Dolly alot, but his music is REALLY bad.Please make more 'mainstream"" music again!! This one is on it's way to used the store."
4,One for the CD rack,"If you only buy one country music CD this year, I would encourage you to buy this well done bluegrass/country album by Dolly Parton. The music sounds fresh and new. Not the style of bluegrass or country that you are used to hearing time and time again. Dolly is in the prime of her carrier and sounds like a million bucks on this CD. This record is full of the kind of music you want to be listening to while BBQ'ing on a summer evening. Easy to listen to with beautiful harmonies. If you enjoy placing a country CD in the player every now and then and hearing something different then this album is perfect."
4,THE BEST!!!!!,"When I heard marry me , It touched my heart and my feet. I love it . Wish it was a single. I play it all of the time .fayesunshine"
5,Worth every penny.,If you like bluegrass you will enjoy. Dolly has alot of great fast picking songs and catchy tunes. I loved it!
4,great bluegrass,"I love most everything about this CD, except there are sevral songs about people dying that I skip whenever I listen to it. But musically it's a brilliant cd. With such an all star band, this CD couldn't go wrong if they tried. I love the bluegrass takes on songs made popular in other genres. Who would have thought Dolly and Cole Porter would mesh so nicely?"
4,One of Dolly's best!,"This is one of Dolly Parton's greatest CDS. My favorite cuts are Down From Dover, Marry Me, Shine. I would have given this recording 5 stars but I Get A Kick Out Of You is a track I wish hadn't made this CD. Also I could do without a 3rd recut of My Blue Tears even though this version is wonderful."
5,"Parton soars with her 2nd bluegrass release ""Little Sparrow""","This is Dolly's 2nd all acoustic album, and it is awesome! If you enjoyed ""The Grass Is Blue"" in 1999, you're gonna love ""Little Sparrow""!!! This album contains some of the best recordings Dolly has done to date. She revisits a couple Dolly classics in ""My Blue Tears"" and ""Down From Dover"", showcases some new material with ""Bluer Pastures"" and ""Mountain Angel"", and Dolly puts her stanmp on Collective Soul's ""Shine"" and The Eagles' ""Seven Bridges Road"". My favorite cuts on the album are ""Shine"", ""I Don't Believe You've Met My Baby"", ""Bluer Pastures"", ""Seven Bridges Road"", ""Mountain Angel"" and ""Marry Me"". Any Dolly fan will welcome this release into their collection! 5 STARS! (I would give it 150 stars, but that's not an option!)"
4,She IS Country When Country Is Too Cool,"You want country music? NO!, Not Country Western or Chixie Dicks! This IS country music. Eddie Van Halen wannabe's do not play Telecasters with $5000 flaming paint jobs here! This is the real dolly we've wanted forever and ever now! Pure country, pure talent. I fell in love with Dolly again and in love with her spiritual connection."
5,sparrific,What can I say...this CD is just wonderful. I had not heard Dolly singing this title song before. As usuual Dolly is at her best
4,Charming,Both my husband and I really liked this CD. The rendition of 'Shine' is truly spiritual. You gotta love Dolly--this CD really captures the sweetness of her voice and character.
5,Dolly's genius,"One of the greatest albums produced in the last decade, each song is brilliant. A must have for any music lover, no matter what genre."
3,ty & alice & alexander graham bell keep the home fires burning,"20th century fox had tyrone power, don ameche, and alice faye star in this fun version of how mrs o'learys cow started the chicago fire, which also saw alice brady win an unmerited oscar as best supporting actress. its all worth a look, but in every way pales when compared to its obvious rival of a year before, the mgm ""san francisco""."
3,"Good movie, great effects. Give it a look","Have friends who simply don't watch old black & white movies? Show them ""In Old Chicago"" and they'll see what some of those old films pulled off. The scenes depicting the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 are simply astounding, moment after moment making one wonder how they did it all with the technology of the late 30's.Of course, initially one has to sit through the first hour of the movie, which I have to say is sort of quaint and old-fashioned with its fictionalized and slightly soapy version of the lives of the O'Leary family. But even these scenes are always at least mildly engaging and are often laced with sharp humor and knowing asides about big city politics.In addition to getting two complete versions of the movie (the shorter regular theatrical release and a longer ""roadshow"" version), a nice batch of extras is also included on the DVD. I especially enjoyed the complete episode of ""Biography"" featuring Don Ameche, one of the film's stars."
4,"A Pre-""Backdraft"" Masterpiece","20th Century-Fox took its cue from MGM's 1936 hit ""San Francisco"" (with its spectacular earthquake scenes) and made its own disaster hit. Tyrone Power and Alice Faye were Fox's answer to MGM's Clark Gable and Jeanette MacDonald, and along with Don Ameche and the incomparable Alice Brady, their film just as fun and entertaining as MGM's hit.Good Americana, with enough melodrama and music to satisfy any diehard movie fan. The highlight is the great Chicago fire, which is even more spectacular than the burning of Atlanta in another 30's classic, ""GWTW"". It is amazing they did all those great special effects without computers and animation. Just good old-fashioned sets on the back-lot. ""In Old Chicago"" is a golden chestnut from the early disaster movie genre of the 1930's."
2,What is Up,Why is it for such a fantastic television show they can not manage a game worth it's the show's worth. I am a dbz freak but i don't think that people are making a good enough game(s) for the show. I would like a story mode maybe like spiderman on XboX or somthing but i just think that an all out fighting game is not what the public wants(or at least me). We need to create a story mode to dbz so people can have a taste at what it would be like to have powers like in dbz. I have been waiting for a game such as i have described ever since dragon ball z started (after dragon ball) i think the customers want to know how toe shoot a khamehameha andd see it's power because that's what video games are for right? To fulfill our imaginations and this is what i am imaginating a story mode dbz
1,MUST READ . if u plan on geting this read this first,my brother got this game and we both thought that it was goin to be the best game ever but we were wrong it is horrinble and we both play the card game . at first i gust thought it was gust him and that he has to get used to it but when i played it it was the worst game ever . i would give this game a zero if i could. do not listen to the other reviews do not get this game ... REMEMBER DO NOT GET THIS GAME!
1,"hopes were high, too high.","When I saw the price of this game tagged onto a DBZ case I was very excited. I quickly read reviews that other owners of the game had posted, and all-in-all this seemed to be a decent, if not GREAT buy.I was wrong -- dead wrong.This game is very, very bad.The rules are written enigmatically, and it is very hard to figure out what exactly is going on just by reading the rules and watching the tutorial.The gameplay is difficult, and annoying. Each time you want to see attributes of a card it takes a long time, and becomes tedious. There is also very little replay value, and if you want to earn one, if not all, of the secret characters you are in for a lot of really tedious playing.Do not buy this game, even if you are a huge DBZ fan."
4,Secret Characters,"Goku gives you NailNail gives you GuldoGuldo gives you KrillinGohan gives you TrunksGarlic Jr. gives you Piccolo(hero and villain cards)Frieza gives you King ColdKing Cold gives you Vegeta(hero and villain cards)You start out with Garlic Jr., Frieza, Goku, and Gohan. Hope these were helpful."
3,"Step learning curve, a good game, but plays very slow","Never having played this game before, I was very dissappointed by the instruction manuel which helped not at all. Fortunately there is an on line rule book that helps alot...I kept at it and finally it all came together, and I started enjoying myself. This is a good game with a good strategic element. The major down side is the very slow game play. The machine takes forever to do anything and as a result, a typical game takes about 45min. Also, it would have been nice had the interface been designed to allow you to easily view the opponents cards that are being played, as it stands, you have to go though several screens to get to the information."
5,Extremely Helpful,This book is extremely helpful in working IN THE CLASSROOM with children who are having difficulties. The book is full of practical strategies both for working with children and managing the classroom while you do it. It's humane perspective and grounding in research and sound theory make it a must for all of us! Excellent!
4,A Very Good Resource,"If you're into ANY aspect of shooting from long guns to handguns to ballistics to reloading to optics...this is a definitive guide on what is what, and why it is that way!While I find it extremely helpful with the gun listings ALONE, the publishers do manage to have a few models slip through the cracks...but that's not to detract from the overall appeal of this yearly publication. The prices included become a good baseline for local dealers, so you can guage market values when looking for ""that special"" gun you always wanted.After all....with SEVEN MILLION copies sold...the publishers MUST be doing something right!One thing I would like to see added (as if they don't put enough information in there already) would be a section of AIRGUNS...not the sirsoft, but things like the Red Ryder BB rifle for example. I know many youngsters shoot these as well, and we shouldn't be leaving them out in the cold, should we?This is a must have (every year)!"
3,Book review,My daughter gave me a copy of ths publication a couple of years ago and I found it quite interesting. I am a regular purchaser of a similiar volumne called Gun Digest which I'd rate at 4 stars. The Shooter's bible gives a slightly differnet slant and makes a welcome addition to my gun library.
2,Good concept ruined by exclusive use of SI units.,"The text appeared quite useful for practicing process engineers until one gets to the exclusive use of SI units. The author converted all of the useful information found in tables and graphs to the SI system, rendering the tables and graphs useless. Most process engineers working in the U.S. use U.S. Customary System units, mainly because the plants they work in are based on the same units of measurements. Myself, I do not want to waste my time converting from SI units to U.S. units when I need information for a design problem. I would not recommend this book for anyone, including students in engineering."
4,Outstanding interpretations of Beatles songs,This recording is excellent and really captures the spirit of the Hard Days Night era perfectly. The bass parts pop and his jazz chording behind the piano solos really make these arrangements swing. I was very impressed and it's a delight to listen to. Thank you.
2,listen before you order,"I am a Beatles fan and a student of jazz guitar, so this CD seemed perfect. I was very disappointed. These arrangements of some great tunes are, in my opinion, cheesy and more appropriate to a low-end Las Vegas lounge act. Mr. Pizzarelli's interpretations are not true to the original aesthetic of the songs and seem like caricatures of the originals."
1,Long and Winding Road,"Why didn't someone - ANYONE - tell Mr. Pizzarelli that this was a bad idea?! Not too many folks this side of Joe Cocker have successfully covered Beatles' songs, so an entire album was an ambitious project indeed. The best thing that can be said is that certain omissions (e.g. ""Norwegian Wood,"" ""Rocky Raccoon"") save this from being an all-out train wreck, although ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" is painful"
4,GREAT Effort by PIZZARELLI,"Some folks below must be deaf, saying this CD is a bad one ! Pizzarelli made a great record, changing the times of the songs sometimes, singing with emotion or flatly other times, and in general the effect is very good. Why buy a CD with covers of the BEatles if the are played exactly the same way the original? This is good, good, good !"
1,Abbey Road Kill,"I generally enjoy Beatles cover albums. I've listened to and enjoyed tributes ranging from Chet Atkins to the Canadian Brass, but this cd by John Pizzarelli needs to have Maxwell's Silver Hammer taken to it. The singing is flat, the arrangemets insipid and the production so schmaltzy that you would not be surprised to hear these performances in a b-list night club. Even the mugshots on the cd booklet cover are silly. What was Pizzarelli thinking? He could not, in all seriousness, have thought this record sounded good. Just listen to ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,"" and you will find yourself screaming ""just shoot me!"" Alvin & the Chipmunks did a better job with the Fab Four! Just think, John! You were outdone by a trio of cartoon characters! It is, perhaps , an act of mercy that this cd is no longer available. It's a wonder it ever saw the light of a release date!"
1,So awful it could be interesting - but I don't think so,"I left the rating box appropriately blank, but Amazon insists I put something in that field. OK, so I'll put one star - but only as a warning to others.I could not listen to more than half way through the second sample track - and I only listened to that because I thought the first sample was a joke. No more energy to waste ...."
1,Not worthy of one star,"I can sing a heck of a lot better then he can, heck... anyone can. And the Beattles, they are nothing worth a tribute album, now Anita O'Day or Lee Wiley they would be worth a tribute album too. This album doesn't swing and is an emberresment to anyone who likes jazz or jazz singers..."
4,A new way to hear the Beatles' songs,"I've been a fan of John Pizzarelli for some time now. As a guitarist and interpreter of jazz standards he has no equal. His interpretations of some of these songs by The Beatles helps shed new light on these classic songs. While a few of the ballads tend to drag a bit, the arrangements are wonderful. The best moments are the swing arrangements done in the style of the big bands. The band sounds great! The best song on the CD though, in my opinion, is ""For No One""...Not one of McCartney's better known songs, it nonetheless represents some of his finest lyric writing. hearing John give it a new and more sensitive reading brought tears to my eyes."
3,S.S.P.,"this game would be worth buying even if it just had golden axe (one of the best action games ever), but when you throw in sonic and echo too, this game is a must-buy. the only downside i can think of is that there are only three games. i'm sure the good people at sega could have done better than that. oh well. all in all, this game has three classic sega games that any old-school gamer will love."
4,What is sega doing to us,Tisk Tisk I thought better when I heard of this game but the games on this cartridge really really stink. Sonic spinball was all right but Golden ax and ecco aren't that great so dont waste your money go buy DOOM on the GBA.
4,2 great Sega games,"I love Golden Axe and Sonic Spinball, but Ecco is what drops my review down to 4 stars. I don't even understand the game. I really hope they make a sequel to this, maybe one that has Altered Beat, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, Ristar, and Flicky."
5,I Love Saga!,My family got a Saga Genesis awhile ago and I still LOVE the games. The sonic games are awsome and challenging. Iam still trying to beat ecco! I would reccomend this to anyone that wants a fun game!!
1,Didnt work,"The product was not working when i received it. When i returned it, it cost more to return than i actually paid for it in the first place"
3,"Awesome games, doubtfull quality...","I am a big SEGA fan, and when I heard this 3-in-one was coming out, I couldn't wait. So I grabbed it on the 26th (the day it came out), but when I actually played it, it was a little disappointed. I figured they would at least enhance the games a little bit, given that the Game Boy Advance is more powerful than the Genesis console. The music seems to be a little worse than the original games, and the title song is VERY annoying.I am giving it 3 stars because it is still fun to play. These are timeless games, and they will entertain you for hours. With the sound off, of course."
4,Not an Average Sound,"I have been to several of their concerts. They soudn pretty good live. HRC seems to be ever changing with their music. I don't mean in the sense that they did a total 180. When songs are written, they are written for a purpose. The artist does not expect you to understand him or her 100% completely. This album is the type where you like it or you hate it. I like the song ""Save You"" though its not a powerful as ""The Pharmacist"" or ""Radiation Suit"" from their last album, Sorry About Tomorrow, which I thought was their best one so far out of three."
1,Excellent,"I like the songs ""Give Me An Inch Girl"", ""Work To Make It Work"", ""Back In My Arms"", the self-titled track, ""Pressure Drop"", ""Fine Time"", and ""Which Of Us Is The Fool"". This is because Robert Palmer could be a good one no doubt about it."
3,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,NOT A GREAT TOY AT ALL MY 2 YR OLD NEICE HAD THIS FOR 3 DAYS AND HER HEAD BROKE OFF...SHE LOVES DORA SO THAT WAS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT...THE DOLLS HEAD IS PLASTIC AND ATTACHES WITH 2 LITTLE PEICES SO IT CAN BREAK EASILY...THE BOTTOM PART IS PLUSHY....AND THE DOLL ISN'T REALLY A ROUGH PLAY KINDA DOLL LIKE MOST KIDS DO WITH THEIR TOYS...SHES A GENTLE DOLL SO IF YOU HAVE A ROUGH AND TUMBLE CHILD I'D SUGGEST NOT GETTING THIS ONE ..DURABLITY IS NOT ONE OF THE KEYS TO THIS TOY
5,So good...,"This book is so, so good.After being childhood friends and sweethearts, Swift returns fifteen years later. Both Amy and Swift have changed a lot. And yet behind all the layers, they are still the same two people who fell in love, and are still in love. I loved this story. It is first and foremost about the healing power of love. A moving, beautiful, and unforgettable tale. Highly recommended!"
3,Comanche Heart,This is the follow up to Comanche Moon. the author is a wonderful story teller and you can almost feel some of the descriptions.
1,Totally Unrealistic,The premise of this book is that at the age of 12 Amy was gang raped repeatedly by over 20 men. Given that there is no way that she would have overcome the mental damage as easily as this author portrayed. I doubt she would have ever recovered from such an experience. This novel is totally unrealistic. Buy something else.
3,Not as good as the first but a decent read.,"I read the first book in one day and I couldn't wait to start the second. I have to admit I was a little disappointed. I understand that Amy was withdrawn because of everything that happened to her but I don't feel like it changed enough in the end. I also didn't find the romance in this book as compelling as Comanche Moon. I think that Swift went out of his way to show his love for Amy but, I don't think it was shown back to him enough. I feel like everything between them was a little forced and I don't really enjoy that in romance novels. I did love getting the update of all the characters though! All in all not a terrible read but not very note worthy either."
4,GREAT AUTHOR!,"Very good book..... The historical significance and detail are outstanding.Found myself skipping through the sex scenes as the ""story"" was super without that detail."
4,"Similar to the first, but still good",This was a great book. I actually enjoyed this book more than the first. My only complaint is that the issues being dealt with in book 2 were the same issues dealt with in book 1. There was a bit of a been there done that feel because of this.
5,Emotional Love Story,"This is one of my all time favorite books. When I saw the reissue at Borders, I scooped it up and reread it to see if it was as good as I remembered. It was. Swift still loved Amy and tried every way he could to break through the shell she had around her because of all of the abuse in her life. When she allowed Swift to take part in the spelling bee, I cried because of the way she allowed his pride to be hurt. He was a brave warrior and she knew he didn't know how to read and write. (and the amount of homework- but he still tried to get her to accept him as her husband according to their Comanche vows.This was a beautiful love story."
5,:),"Seriously, even if this WOULD HAVE been a crappy piece and broke the first time I wore it, it still would have definatley been worth it for 99 cents!"
1,Very cheap and heavy!,"I own couple of love knot studs and seen many, but I've never seen such a poor quality ones! those are huge! very very heavy and cheaply made! the grooves are painted carelessly with black paint to enhance the looks and give a false feeling of void, but it's actually a colored block of solid steel. I highly recommend going for the classic ones (plain) they look much classier, smaller and lighter."
4,"Starts out stuffy, then takes flight","This collection of learned essays starts off rather studious, with a lot of notes on the scriptural sources of Christological doctrines. But the later essays grow into a theme of how the Gospels have changed history. And here we see a record of people moved, not by doctrines and creeds, but by what Jesus actually taught. I'd especially recommend the inspiring essays, ""The gospels embodied: the lives of saints and martyrs"", by David Matzko McCarthy, and ""Living the gospels: morality and politics"", by Scott Bader-Saye.--author of Correcting Jesus"
5,Extraordinary record,"I love Piano Quintet op.44, a masterpiece of lyrism and psychological density. And I love Martha Argerich. She is a hurricane. She has astonishing technical mastery as much as flame, carnal impetus, surprise. The other interpreters are compatible ones and join with refinement the piano queen. It is an extraordinary record. Five stars."
5,Awesome Glass Cleaner,"Gets the glass crystal clear and works as well as Rain-X at keeping water off the windshield. Did all the windows, inside and out, in my 4-door sedan and I still have 3/4 of a bottle left over."
4,Works like it should,Works like it should. Just be sure to rub the windows thoroughly as light wiping alone doesn't remove everything.
1,Item is Not Whay is Shipped,"The item shown is not what is sent. There is some kind of product name SNAFU because the item shipped is a strap-on harness not the bed bondage strap shown. Apparently, both products have the same name. I returned the incorrect items. Waiting to see what shows up in return. Obviously, if time is an issue, you may want to spend the couple of extra dollars and buy this product elsewhere until they get this thing straightened out."
3,Il rosso segno della follia,"Good movie, good digital transcription, considering the age of the film in question.definitely a movie to have in your collection. A cult."
4,What others didn't tell...,"Gramophone lists this CD as a recommended recording for this VC. I can't claim it as the best in the crowded competition but it will be a nice addition to your library.'Cause others wrote positive reviews I will talk about some trifles. When Vengerov enters at 2:45 to the 1st mvt. the very first note is played shorter than actual duration. It should be played as a note 6/5 as long as a quarter note. (a quater note is tied to a 16th note of a 16th-note quintuplet) At 4:16 to the 1st mvt. he loses control and creates an awkward moment.His playing is somewhat nervous and sounds laborious.If you want only one recording of Brahms VC, get Oistrakh/Szell. Oistrakh. efforless and sublime playing from Oistakh together with heartful conducting from Szell make that one essential."
4,Robert Palmer Sneaks In Blue Eyed Soul For Solo Debut,"Robert Palmer's 1974 release Sneaking Sally Through The Alley finds the singer emersed in the blue eyed soul and New Orleans funk rock sounds that dominated much of his early work. The album, Palmer's first as a solo artist after fronting Vinegar Joe and Dada among other bands, has strong funk rock chords throughout the arrangements and the young Palmer's voice is surprisingly soulful and emotive. Palmer worked extensively in his early career with Little Feat, The Meters, Allan Touisaint, and Lowell George, and all of their influences are felt here. In fact, the album's title track and debut single were written by Touisaint. Funk rock fans will enjoy this album as classic rock style collection while die hard Robert Palmer fans will enjoy seeing a more expressive and creative side to the singer than what was shown on his big 80's hard rock hits."
4,one of my favorite from the 80's!,"I couldn't find my original CD which I thought had survived since the 80's through 4 kids, lots of parties, and 4 moves! I recall a group of us on a girl's night out at the Robert Palmer outdoor concert at the Concord Pavilion; lots of happy memories! I not only had teenaged children in those days, but also employed highschoolers in my ice cream store, and they all loved it also.I wanted to put this music on a memory stick for my new car to enjoy it on a road trip, but I couldn't find it so had to purchase this download for sure. Then the original showed up as we cleaned out the old 14-year old car we sold! This is my favorite of the Palmer music that I own or know about."
3,The other Robert Palmer (pre-Power Station days),"When I think of Robert Palmer - I think of songs such as ""Simply Irresistible"" or ""Addicted to Love"". This album is of a completely different style (bluesy, but not boring; rocking, but not that strong). The reason for owning it is for the Sailing Shoes/Hey Hey Julia/Sneaking Sally Through the Alley segues: at first I was confused why none of these songs made it onto his Greatest Hits cd, but it makes sense that these songs are a trilogy, and any one wouldn't be worth listening to without the others. The rest of the album is filler, which is listenable, but not that great."
4,great family film,"I thought this was great for the whole family. This movie is not rated, and usually, I base many of my choices on the rating. For those of you who do the same: The language overall was good. I think they used the word ""sucks"" a few times. There was a quick reference to ""the naked channel"", but it was very quick and not focused on. The main character asks what it is, and the supporting character says ""it's a lot like the nature channel only more gross"", and that was that. There is a bully that they call ""Butterbutt"", but one little girl says that isn't nice to call him that so they make an effort to show that this is unacceptable. These are very minor, and the theme of the movie is very touching and shows that wishes still come true for those who believe."
5,Marianne faitfull,"great voice, good to hear her wonderful voice. Saw her once when she was hanging around with mick Jagger. has improved with age"
4,Finally some honest reviews,"This is the first time I see some honest differences in opinion on an album that should be highly considered in ones collection.For me Broken English is a solid 4 or 5 star performance. I love her whiskey and cigarette voice. The songs have a dark attitude that work well together. You may want to keep the kids out of the room on the last track (and remember, this is 1979 when she was ""laying the smack down"" on her ex). Read the other positive reviews, they say it well, and by all means buy it!"
4,Third time was the charm...,"...Marianne had attempted two comeback albums prior to Broken English, the first attempt was way back in 1970, and an attempt that was never finished, Rich Kid Blues, and never released in its time. in 1976 there was her country album Faithless, Dreamin' My Dreams, No Regrets, whatever you call it was a success in Ireland of all places, it was a fine attempt, though not a huge success. Then you have Broken English, and what followed was Marianne's most productive time since the 60s-musically that is. The stand outs are obvious-Broken English, Ballad of Lucy Jordan, Why You'd Do It. Working Class Hero is a fine cover. The only song I didn't like was the Witches SOng, due to strong personal conviction, I don't like it so much. Other than that we have a strong debut of Marianne's second career."
4,Cigarettes and vodka can do this to you too,"Love it! Sometimes you just need more than chocolate to make you feel better...Marriane Faithful is more than Mick Jagger's Ex.. she is a talented and articulate song writer too. This album showcases her deep, smokey voice, but its not for the faint hearted. This is a great album to play after the big fight.. or break-up. Wallow in you misery withMarrianne.Not recommended for those on anti-depressants."
3,Very Dark!,"In her prime, Marianne Faithful was one of the most beautiful women on this planet with her chestnut hair, sensual lips, and soulful eyes. It is depressing enough to see how drugs have taken their toll. Its's even more depressing listening to it. Using Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" as a gauge for measuring bleakness, only three albums fall below: Depeche Mode's ""Black Celebration"", Jesus and Mary Chain's ""Darklands"", and Ms. Faithfull's ""Broken English"". Ms. Faithfull is very intellegent, and though her vocals are poor, she more than compensates with a true understanding of what she sings. ""Working Class Hero"" is more bitter than Lennon's version. ""Witch's Song"" is sensual. ""Lucy Jordan"" is sad. ""Why'd You Do It"" is vulgar and depressing. A very dark and disturbing album. Not one for Friday Night parties. The question I would ask is what would make Marianne happy?"
2,There are better albums....,I'm a fan of Marianne's...but am disappointed by this album. 20th century ballad is much better...
2,Marianne's Big Mistake..,"I'm a big fan of Marianne...but I don't understand why she made this record. Especially, her musical style doesn't match with John Lennon's Working Class Hero at all!! This is the big difference between she and other female artists, such as Patti Smith - when she just sings, she does very well - when she TRIES to be something other than her own musical persona, the result is disaster. If you want her soul, reason of her fame, I recommend other records...I cannot give more than 2 stars."
2,"Geez, I'm disappointed.............",I'm a big fan of Marianne's...but I was really disappointed when I purchased this record... I would rather recommend <20th Century Ballad> It's much better - you will see her maturity. This <Broken English> is Broken piece of her fame. ;)
5,One of the best toys I have ever bought,"My 3-yr old loves this toy. It is very durable, cute and just plain fun. My daughter dances and sings with her Dora and repeats words in spanish just like the doll does. I didn't expect to find this toy to be as educational as it turned out to be. My daughter now knows that ""rosada"" means pink (her favorite color) in spanish. In fact, she uses that word now often. I highly recommend this toy!"
2,Waste of money,"If you want a Dora doll that your child will cuddle and love this is NOT it. She's hard, unyielding and only does one grouping of phrases. Her arms and legs do not bend, so your daughter can not put her in a stroller and take her for a walk. My 2 year old daughter is a MAJOR Dora fan and did not like this one at all. I took this doll back and got a soft plush Dora doll that has a comb and activity book. It was cheaper and my daughter takes her everywhere. This one is not worth the money."
1,Limited Value,"I bought this toy for my 4 year old. She enjoys the familiar ""We Did It"" song. However, this plays only after the same three recorded messages and she says them in the same sequence, every time. I was hoping the toy would expand her knowledge of Spanish - beyond the word for ""pink"". Her backpack doesn't even open. Now the fun is to try to get the doll to sing the song in sequence with the show's signature song. That's about it."
5,WE DID IT!!!!,"We just love Dora and this toy is really adorable! We all swing side to side singing we did it ... I was happy with that feature ... I had no idea how much this doll does. To the delight of my 2 year old she says ""swiper no swiping"" and she also speaks a few spanish phrases and asks your child to repeat them. My 2 year old is speaking more spanish that me!!! She asks your child to count the beads on her bracelet and then count in spanish with her ... and more! Her voice is VERY clear and she is more than we expected!"
5,BEST DOLL,All my son wanted for Christmas last year was this doll. We live in Australia so I had to have my friend ship the item to me. My son is now 4 and he fights with his 1 year old sister. It is very durable and they love it to death.
5,ADORABLE FOR DORA'S FANS,"MY TWO YEAR-OLD LOVES DORA AND THE MINUTE SHE SAW THIS DOLL, SHE NEVER LET IT GO. NOW MY LITTLE GIRL IS TALKING IN SPANISH."
5,Great toy!,"I bought this doll for my niece at Christmas. Her twin brother loves it too! They even repeat Dora when she said words in Spanish. They are only 18 months old and know which shoe will make Dora talk, and they are always walking around the house looking for her."
2,Warning this review is not about the product it's about a customer review,This review is for the 2005 kid's review bellow. The kid down there said that this toy did not have a head. Then she ordered another one and it's foot was missing COME ON PEOPLE!!! Do you people actually think that? Well iv'e seen some kid reviews that are FALSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.S. I'm a boy and 10 years old going to turn 11 in october 4. Oh and click this linkFisher-Price We Really Did It Dora Dolland you will see that my little sister reviewed a one star review on that product.
1,Dancing Dora,"My four year old daughter just had to have this toy. My mother bought it for her for Christmas. Once it was out of the package, her comment was, ""she's too hard to sleep with"". When I tried to coax her back into playing with it, only to please Grandma, she pushed the button to make it move and walked away. I personally think that the Spanish leaves much to be improved upon. The words are not very clear, thus teaching kids the worng pronounciation. If it wouldn't have come from my mother, it would be the next thing in the Goodwill bag."
3,For younger children,"My daughter was three and a half when I gave her this Dora doll. She outgrew it very quickly. Dora is fun and speaks Spanish but my daughter got bored quick. The doll sings the Dora song and dances, and she speaks a few phrases but that is about it. My daughter plays more with her stuffed Dora doll that is lighter and more flexible. This doll is hard and only the arms and head move. Younger children who come to the house can't put it down though."
3,Wrong words,I gave this toy to my friends daughter who is learning spanish she got tired of it after a wile. Thats why I rated it 3 stars. I did 3 stars for durable because it runs out of batterys after a wile. I did not want to do any stars for educatonal because it says the wrong meanings of some spanish words: one time it said muy bien means great when it means very well!
2,Disappointed,This toy was OK right up until some body gave Dora an extra manual twist... Now Dora does not twist or dance anymore... That is 50% of the fun. Her vocabulary is very limited. My husband threw away the box the next day and now I can not return it. One positive comment-My grand daughter did learn how to say Pink in spanish.
1,Dora did not speak English,"I returned the Dora as it did not speak English. The language the doll ""speaks"" should always be listed. My daughter had the same Dora doll 10 yrs ago when she was a baby; and she wanted the Dora as hers (that spoke English/Spanish) broke."
3,Interesting Argument,"It's short and to the point. It discusses the Islam interpretation of the Bible that discredits Christianity entirely.I can definitely see how the arguments presented could convince some people that Christianity is wrong. It's a good thing Christianity isn't belligerent or murderous or he'd be marked for death!It's interesting that if someone wrote something similar to this about the Prophet Mohammad, a fatwa would be issued and they would have a billion Muslims out to hunt them down and murder them in the name of Islam."
1,The Biggest Secret,"Read ""The Biggest secret"" by David Icke, to know that Jesus never existed and Muhamed been manupilated by The Anunnaki. so Moslems and Christians will stop fighting over bunch of lies"
1,Outdated,This book is not worth the money.. No help at all..The answers are not clearly explained and the information is outdated..
2,Worthless,This book didn't even coincide with my statics course. It was difficult to understand and consumes a lot of time to get any understanding from the material. Would not recommend.
3,Stats,"Well, I am somewhat new in the stats classroom. I think that the book does start out in a way that one can understand, but later in the chapters it gets confusing. I like the fact that it gives you real life examples and ways you can actually use the book, but perhaps it is just me. In general, the book is readable."
5,Right on time,It was fairly inexpensive. Everyone in my class got theirs for more than what I got it. Great packaging. Came on time.
4,great idea to rent books,good price for a rented book ... the process was simple receiving and sending back the book they also give you enough time to rent
2,There Are Superior Stats Books,"The content itself is mediocre, and comparable to another stats book I used. However, the tables and examples are bland, as is the color scheme of the book (printed in 2 colors). Engaging a student in statistics is difficult as it is, blocks and blocks of black print are sure to discourage further. I found Triola's examples far more meaningful, and the enthusiasm of the author much more apparent."
2,Bad edition of a useful book...,"If you are an instructor avoid this book. I have used older editions of this book because they have been easy for students to understand. With the eighth edition I have had to pass out lists of corrections and mistakes in the book. They are nothing major, but often confuse students."
3,Not what I expected.,"The information is good and a lot of it was helpful, but I misunderstood the contents that led me to purchase it in the first place. I believe i was looking for something else entirely."
3,CSI Miami Season 1,"The product showed up but not as stated, it had scratches on the cd which skipped a few times but it still plays."
5,A great start,"Although this show has faded down the stretch, the first season of CSI: Miami is definitely worth the pick-up. The cases are fantastic but still believable, as is the science for solving them. The characters are varied and believable, with (with the exception of Horatio, the lead character, who is developed more slowly - not at all until season 2, really) just enough personal touches to convince you they are real people who lead real lives outside of the crime lab but not enough to distract you. Usually spin-offs are doomed for failure, but every now and then you get a good one. For the first few seasons, at least, this was one of the best."
4,CSI MIAMI at last!,"Wow I have seen some of the reviews given......blew me away. I love this show and I started watching it on A&E;! No wonder, cause A&E; has some of the best shows ever! CSI was a question to start with because I really didn't like David Caruso from NYPD Blue, but I love him in this show. I love the cast and I really like the story lines. I can't get my self wrapped around the other CSI shows, but I do like this one. I also like all of the Law and Order shows. So you see where my loyalties are. The Closer, Saving Grace all on A&E;, so it is no wonder that CSI Miami caught my eye. Now I am an UNBOX fan watching my shows when I can on my Creative Vision: M 30 G........love that too!no kidding if you haven't tried this show, please give it a shot.I give it 4 stars!!"
3,"Ugh. And yet, I bought season 2. I'm pathetic.","Ok, so CSI the original is quite addictive, right? and I got desperate for something new on DVD, so I tried CSI Miami, because I sort of had to try at least one season to get through to CSI New York, which has much more promise. And yes, the first season is just as bad as I feared. It's awful. David Caruso is horrific, overacting for all he's worth; the blond southern chickie and the black doctor chickie are equally shudder-worthy in places, although they have a heck of a lot more moments of grace than ""Horatio"" does. I sincerely hope this gets much better as it goes on because right now I'm sort of stupefied. And yet, still better than some of the other stuff I end up watching, so I must just be a bad TV junkie... Maybe it just grows on you, like a fungus? Here's to hoping - I bought season 2 on speculation.It has to get better, right?*whimper*"
5,This is an awesome show!,This is a good show. Everythings good about it. They were filming this show a few blocks away from where I live a couple of times. (...). I love this show
3,"Acting varies, plots too pat","One big problem I have with this show is that David Caruso forgot that he was once a very good actor. I've enjoyed his work in NYPD Blues and other movies. In CSIM he gives the same facial expression. What happened to the actor who could make you care about him?The rest of the cast is okay. Only Alexx Wood is a unique and charismatic character. Too much of the show is eye candy. I read that this is the world's most popular show. Remember when it was Baywatch? Too bad, there's a lot of wasted talent. Some episodes can be entertaining but the character interaction is superficial."
2,Gave it a Chance but...,"I really did give this a chance but I can't say I like the show. It focuses more on the ""police"" aspect and less on the science, which differentiates the CSI series from most of the other garbage out there. I know David Caruso has his fans but I just can't appreciate him in this vehicle..."
1,What is so great about this show...?,"They throw a lot of make-up on the actors and they end up walking,talking,thinking, and acting like Robots. I have never seen more wooden acting on the show, then here. If this is supposed to be a great show, I hate to see their idea of a bad one."
4,I Like the Show But...,"I generally like the show and sometimes preferred it to the original CSI, but I have to agree to another reviewer's opinion. While I like David Carusio's character, he is becoming boring and predictable to me. While he often talks tough to suspects, the ""suspect"" usually turns out to be innocent! And Emily Procter, while no doubt a beautiful lady, is in my opinion the worst actress I've seen. Why is she always so cheerful? She smiles while there's nothing to smile about. Why can't she get that grin out of her face? Is she on drugs? I remember there's one episode in which she's affected by cocaine and was high, but I couldn't tell the difference because that's the way she's always been!"
1,Too bad,"CSI : Miami is, in my opinion, the best TV series i have ever seen.I've been waiting for this DVD release so long... Too bad : the only audio tracks are English and spanish. No french.More than this : no subtitles, even in english.Conclusion : I will not buy it.So disappointing !"
1,Sunglasses of Doom,"Aside from Cochrane who gets an occasional good scene in, this show is nothing like the original. Instead of justice seekers, most of the main characters in the episodes come off as morality cops indirectly implying that each victim's lifestyle led to his/her demise. Also, the ideas of 'due process' and 'Miranda rights' appear to not be relevant when questioning suspects."
1,Not even close to original CSI Vegas,"those of you who started from the original CSI series, forgot this Miami makeover. the storylines and especially Caruso's performances doesn't worth a cent. CSI series were supposed to be more cerebral and at the opposite extreme of NYPD Blue, but Caruso made it looked like a cheap NYPD clone.those who got duped with its false promises, I suggest you moved to real action in ""The Shields"", or better still, the original NYPD series."
5,AB FAB!!,"I Love CSI. I didn't think there was an episode I missed over here in the UK. But having started to watch the first series last night I realised there is alot I had missed. I am really really pleased with my purchase. I would like to send a big thank you to Amazon!!! The only thing I could say is that I didn't know about the customs charge. I wish there was an option on Amazon to click on that would tell you the customs charge for the items you are going to buy. It does warn you about custom charges and to check, but I didn't as I thought DVD's would be fine. I will just have to use Amazon.co.uk from now on to avoid. But I am still thrilled!!"
3,Spinoffs that are very average...,"There are a few problems with CSI Miami. One is David Caruso is far too aragont, and not in a good way like Hugh Laurie from House MD. The other issue I have it the coroner that talks to all the bodies in a sweet way like they are all children that are sleeping or doing something that should be rewarded. Now the cases are pretty good, and some of them are even close to as moving as the ones in CSI Las Vegas. Calleigh Duquesne is pretty attractive but somewhat anoying in voice. All in all it is a worth while series to watch but the cast has much to be desired."
3,Would have been a 5 except for Kim Delaney,"I have to say that I truly love this show. I watch current episodes every Monday night. Having said that, I actually stopped watching season one, 4 shows in, because Kim Delaney was such a poor fit to the rest of the ensemble cast that she dragged the whole show down. I started watching again once she was gone and it seemed the stories were better and the cast worked 100% better without her.I would buy this set, if I could get it minus the episodes she was in.I will buy Season 2 once it's out. I have to say also that I watched this show initally because I was a CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Fan....looking at this latest season on TV, I think that CSI: Miami has actually gotten significantly better than it's spawning series - too bad too cause the original series was so good until recently......"
2,,"This show lacks many things when compared to CSI: namely acting, and good writing. Curuso is a total bore, no personality and acts exactly the same as he did on NYPD Blue. A total let down, but that was to be expected. I would go so far as to say that this is a poor show, period. I watched the entire first season, always waiting for it to get better. It never did. The only decent acting comes from Procter and the M.E. from News Radio, who is utterly unbelieveable in her role. This is what happens when TV execs recycle TV shows. Suprisingly, CSI NY is even worse, and I have tremendous respect for Sinise as an actor.Don't fake the funk."
5,BEST SHOW ON TV,"I never started watching CSI: Miami from the beginning, but after I saw the 1st show...I WAS HOOKED!!! Original CSI characters just didn't click for me. CSI: Miami characters work very well together, and no one is any more important than anyone else. They all work together to make the show. Anxiously waiting for next season on DVD."
3,First season was the best,"Season 1 of CSI Miami was the best, with the characters trying to find themselves, solid writing and acting !David Caruso actually seem to take the show seriously!"
5,WIERD,Thematically poor it may well be but this is a great CD. The opening music is the most distant and morbid I have ever heard. It's great. Track 13 is a classic and 20 and 24 create a VERY downbeat tone. This is an unmissable CD.
5,Moto GP,"This game surprised me.It's excellent.Just plainfun to play and the graphics are sweet.Alot of peoplewhined about the controls but,these people more thanlikely never rode a bike.You don't steer a bike,youlean it.Accurate simulation,superb graphics and a blastif you like racing games.I rented it first and then headedup to the store shortly there after and snagged a copy.Good game!"
5,Excellent Gaming Experience,"Moto GP is an outstanding game. Even if you are not a huge motorcycle racing fan, which I am not, this game will be fun for you if you like racing sims.Gameplay: 9The most realistic physics engine ever used for a Gran Prix motorcylce game (confirmed by a friend who has driven them). The training mode helps you move up the learning curve and build up your own character. You also unlock riders and other extras through winning races in two different modes: arcade and the GP circuit. You can even do tricks, which will actually help you in arcade mode.Graphics: 8Top-notch graphics. Could they be better? Sure, but for this experience they really don't need to be. Excellent detail and shading on the courses and the bikes themselves.Replay: 8.5The only reason this is not a 9, or even a 10, is that I feel there could be more courses. Ten courses is not too shabby, though. The action in both single player and multiplayer is enough to bring you back for more... and more..."
5,Tight!,"THis is the most fun racing game ever made! The controls are great and the graphics are amazing. You can not go onlie with this game though. You have to get Xbox live and the online version comes on the setup disk. You use the real game to unlock special things in the online version. So they work together. If you have both, you're made!"
4,nice,i have it the graphics are awesome and theres a couple of veiws u can use when your playing it.. and its really fun on 2 players... but do you think they'll have a road rash kind of game for xbox..?
1,Did not captivate the kids.,The kids tried this game and lost interest quickly. It has collected dust since. It is not recommended.
1,too boring...,this game is too boring i recommend scooby-doo and the cyber-chase or scooby doo night of 100 frights they are much more exciting
2,"Raggy, Ris is Rerrible!","Oh my gosh, what a waste. This was a terrible game. The ratings go like this:Graphics: 2/10The graphics are terrible. Theryre all fuzzy and unsharp.Conrols:2/10Moving Scooby is real hard. He goes the opposite way sometimes that you want to go. And sometimes youll be pressing the button and he wont even move.Music: 1/10The music is haunting. Its like the music you hear when your on your deathbed.Fun: 5/10This fun is alright. The problem is that you have to get to different places, but they all look the same, so you dont know where to go.Overall: 2/10The game cold be better with some improvments, and they sholdve spent a little more time on it instead of rushing it out onto the market."
1,Really Bad!,this game is terrible. the gameplay was great... compared to watching paint dry. this is a total waste of the buyers and producers money.
4,Nice Lenses for the Price,"I own a Minolta A200 Dimage Digital Camera and I needed to upgrade as the standard lens was no longer cutting it. These lenses are a nice pair of for the price. There is very heavy tunneling and vignetting when you attach the lense to the camera. The only way that I found you could cut down on the issue is to use the digital zoom to fill out the frame. It doesn't affect the picture too much and I've been able to take some wonderful photos with the lenses. Nice for the price, but if they cost any more than $75.00 for the pair, I'd say skip em."
2,Lame O,"Gay Happening maybe a few years ago! This stuff is lame and short, hardly any club quality length mixes here. Save yourself [the money], and spend money on a cover charge at the club."
1,Dreadfully boring,"I could only bear the first 110 pages. I can't stand reading anymore. Argh! I gave it this much time of my life because he is a renowned author and deserved some respect, but, one can only take so much boredom. Sorry to all the Theroux lovers."
1,Really boring....,"This is the first book that I have read by Paul Theroux. I am generally a Stephen King reader but unfortunally my English teacher does not allow him for a book report. Anyways, I had an oral presentation to do today on The Black House, and since this book didn't catch my intrest, I only read to page 25. Come on! I was falling asleep. I still give all regards to the author but I just couldn't stand the boring lit."
2,Very poor sound quality,"The music in this album is beautiful, however the sound quality is very poor, full of harsh sound to my ear."
3,A few details,"This isn't exactly a review... first of all, the disc is not full-frame, it's widescreen. In fact, it calculates to about 2.50:1 which is wider than your basic Panavision film! Second, the running time is just over 90 minutes, not 112. Third, my copy is in a snapper case, not a keepcase.Okay, I'll make a few comments. The 3D effect is not very good - I've always had trouble with these red/blue 3D presentations - but it's a lot better when viewed on a computer monitor than on a television for some reason. The movie is interesting but there's not much payoff - they're trapped in this bubble, we know there's something controlling the people inside, but it's all situation and not enough conclusion. Probably due to its era, it reminded me a lot of an episode of LAND OF THE GIANTS. Regardless of my mild negativity, since I really enjoy this genre, I liked the movie enough to give it 3 out of 5."
3,duck!,"ok...you really have to play around with your tv color adjustment to get the right setting for the 3D effects to work. Basically, you need to set it so that the blue portion of the 3D image matches the blue lens of your 3D glasses.As for the story, well, it was kinda weak, and very similar to the (as stated above) Twilight Zone episode where the couple wakes up, hungover, after a party in a strange town that seems to have no escape. Here, however, the characters get to the outskirts of town to find a clear wall/dome surrounding the city. I don't want to ruin anything here, so I will just say that the conclusion is really a let down, and very unclear at best.Very cheesy movie, only recommended for those who love 3D movies no matter WHAT the quality or plot."
1,The Bubble 3-d DVD,"The 3-d effects on this movie are poor at best. Even adjusting the color on the TV as reccomended does not improve. I normally have no problem viewing 3_D effects, however, this movie only has a select few scenes that actually appear in 3-d. The problem may be in the poor quality of the recording."
5,Andy Griffith,"Love his singing voice. Arrived in great shape.Aww comeon now, I don't have time to write abook about all these things!"
2,Big Mistake,"I've got to admit, I was very sad to hear that ""Andy"" had passed away, and I'm sure that is what prompted my impulse buying of two of his DVD / albums. I wish that I had taken the time to hear a couple of selections before buying them --- 'cuz if I had, I'd NEVER have purchased them. Don't get me wrong, he was a wonderful actor, and probably a very nice person, but I did not enjoy his singing."
4,Andy Griffith gospel songs,"I purchased this CD for my mother who is 82. She has been a long-time Andy Griffith fan, especially of Matlock. This was a surprise gift and she loved it. I received the CD in great condition and the total time from order to delivery was perfect."
2,A waste of time,"I was disappointed by this book. The author focusses almost exclusively on matters that probably never concerned more than a few Tamils and certainly aren't taken seriously today. Reading this book to learn about ""Being a Person the Tamil Way"" would be like studying the fine details of feng shui to learn about being a person the Chinese way. Putting it another way, imagine reading a whole chapter in a book about what we mean when we speak of ""home"". Do we mean our present house? Our parents' house? Our town, our region, our country? How would we define the boundaries of our ""home""? Maybe this book makes sense to a particular type of academic or intellectual, but for anyone who merely wishes to read an ethnography about Tamil culture, this book would be a waste of time."
4,Complete Films of Cary grant,An invaluable resource.Covers every film from Sinners in the Sun to Walk Don't Run.Lots of nice pics.
2,Not satisfied,"As other reviewers have said this product was too hot even on warm. It consistently burned the food when left for long periods (such as at work). It seemed to develop hot spots and the lid is also now cracked. It worked OK for a few years, not great but OK."
2,too hot even on warm,ok i have tried this for several months what should be cooked on low for 6 to 8 hours cooks on low in 3 to 4 hours and about the same on warm ordered it for the programmable settings but will be tossing it and trying another if i put it on in the am for supper (the reason i bought it) food is way over cooked even when i cook on warm more recent reviews dont seem to be having this problem so perhaps it has been corrected like i said i have had mine for about 6 months
3,Tries but does not quite capture fleeting magic from debut,"The indie smash debut from these guys (Mass Romantic) is overrated as it is, despite having a few amazing songs that really do transcend the confines of rigidness, instead exploding into pure distilled pop-rock bliss. On their follow up, the Porn's play it safe, offering thirteen tracks of signature catch-tastic riffs, but by and large lacking a memorable compositional spark that made for a few classic anthems for fans of the first album. Arguably this disc is finer tuned and fussed with a bit more, but in the end many decent tracks from this band are not as good as a few great ones."
5,Not a bad song on this . . .,"This is a rare find . . . a CD that you do not have to skip any horrible tracks. Every song on this is great. Great production, great songwriting, great harmonies, tight musicianship . . . pure joy for the ears."
5,Hooks to land a whale,"Canada's indie supergroup (not very appealing, I know) the New Pornographers have created a modern masterpiece of rock/pop hooks and brilliant performances. I ask anyone who has heard this album to name me one sub-par song...exactly, it's impossible. If you like the Cars, or Cheap Trick, or any good band who knew their way around a good pop song, get this album immediately. 13 songs, 13 works of pop art. You will not regret this purchase."
5,Non-stop fun,This album is simply non-stop fun. I can't stop listening. It's catchy goodness will surely rope you in.
4,The successful formula continues...,"The approach 'don't fix it if it ain't broke' definitely applies to the New Pornographers' 2nd album, which is just as strong and appealling as their debut. If anything, 'Electric Version' could be considered 'Mass Romantic Part 2' building upon the same successful formula...catchy guitar hooks, sparkling melodies (along with Neko Case's silky sweet vocals), romping keyboards, and an allround infectious power-pop vibe that makes it a treat to listen to. Energetic yet playful at the sametime."
3,Good. Not Great.,"This is really unfair to say, but this record just isn't as good as ""Mass Romantic."" I wanted to like it more than I do, but no dice. Whereas ""Mass"" sounded exhuberant and explosive, this just sounds flat. Is it better than most everything you hear on the radio today? Probably. Is it better than ""Mass Romantic""? No."
3,Not as good as Mass Romantic,"Obviously, this album hardly compares to ""Mass Romantic."" The hooks are still there, and its still very solid, but it is far from memorable. All the songs quickly began to feel entirely too similar, and I grew bored very easily listening to it, which never happened with their debut. Certainly, some songs are still fun and catchy, but most pop albums have a few songs like that. No one song jumps out as particularly interesting or memorable, however, and that is the main problem with ""Electric Version."""
4,Wow!!!,"This is probably the best pop record I've heard in years (even better than The Shins, which is saying a lot). Every song sounds brilliantly original and the alternating vocalists keep it fresh for the 13 songs. Unlike most albums which start out great then get bleak towards the end this one starts out great but gets stronger and stronger towards then end. This will definitely be a band that I will keep my tabs on. If you're an Indie or Pop fan this record is a must buy. This is ten thousand times better than any mainstream pop record out there."
3,warms up ok,"I picked up this album because I like the Shins, and I heard this was similar. It is, but too many of the songs lack a certain warmth - they are too cute for their own good, like the band is trying to be teenage Japanese popsters.It warms up by the end, the hooks get smarter and the whole thing feels less tiresome and plastic, yielding several truly decent songs - the best being ""Testament to Youth in Verse,"" with its vocal bells at the end, ""July Jones,"" and ""It's Only Divine Right."" It's unusual to find an album's best tracks stacked at the end, but here you go."
2,Maybe you need to be Canadian ...,"I am surprised by the universally high marks for this album. I have tried to like it, it is just to saccharine-sweet for me. I do like other Canadian bands, though."
3,pretty well done but boring,pop music. very happy sounding. kind of like the Cars. i put these guys in with Stars and Fountains of Wayne. they all can write nice pop hooks but it's just all been done before. tried and true. well done but there's nothing really interesting or lasting with them. the songs are fun for a little if you like them at all and then they get really annoying. maybe i'm wrong because i have been annoyed by these bands from the beginning.
5,The New Face of Zero and One,"Energetic, surprisingly highly energetic indie rock from Neko Case and her Pornographers. Actually, she's got a huge amount of talent all around her including Carl Newman (Zumpano), Dan Bejar (Destroyer) with John Collins and Kurt Dahle holding the rythem down tight. This collaborative supergroup turns out upbeat, single-quality, killer music on nearly every track. ""All for Swinging You Around"" or ""The Laws Have Changed"" would be my top picks, but just about every track is a winner. But, c'mon, even if you aren't buying that....Niko=HOTTIEST WOMAN IN INDIE ROCK PLZ KTHX BY NOW PLZ"
3,The Problem Is Simple,"It's a good CD, not a great one. The problem: Too much Carl Newman, way too little Neko Case. OK, I'll admit it: I'm a huge Neko fan. But, even if I weren't, I'd wonder about the division of labor on lead vocals here. Case's 3.5 tracks stand out so distinctively. Why not let her take the lead on half or more? That grip not withstanding, ""Electric Version"" is as advertised: Power pop with lots of energy and intelligent songwriting."
3,Not what I expected,"The Permian-Triassic End Event, 256 MY ago, caused the extinction of 95% of this planet's marine species and 70% of all land species. Some of what survived became the big famous dinosaurs. Some of what survived became US.If you're looking for a book on this topic that DOES NOT talk much at all about the species being extincted (except for little tiny marine organisms like brachiopods and bryzoans), this is the book for you.Lots and lots of info on Siberian flood basalts and carbonate sedimentation.The book's main topic is the causes of the extinction, so it is mainly paleo-geology, rather than paleobiology."
2,Some self-aggrandizing here...,"It is always gratifying to see popular books about science get rave reviews because we scientists benefit from public enthusiasm about what we do. Erwin has a chatty and disarming style that is a joy to read. Unfortunately, it is a public disservice to distort reality as Erwin has done in this book. In depicting his role in the whodunit, Erwin has liberally embellished his own contributions and those of his colleagues. After proclaiming for years that the extinction was unrelated to the Siberian volcanism, this book now implies that such a relationship was his idea. The whitewashing treatment of his team's blunder in misdating the extinction and related events is worthy of the most guileful politician explaining away some scandalous act.As long as you don't mind the plethora of factual errors and self-promotional aspects, it is a fine book. Unfortunately, it will not weather history well."
3,Pride B-,"Unfortunaly this album is is highly overratedIt's good, but not $24 to 78$ goodI feel this album is one robert's lowkey concept albumIts suffers from a carribean influnce from his earlier albumsBeing that said out of 10 tracks 7 are the best""Silver Gun"" What The Heck?It's more baffling than a b- side from tears for fearsSaturine Martial Luntatic cd, namely body wah or dejvu sins of science?I still enjoy Robert Palmer and respect him for doing what he wanted dobut ,. This is B- album, secrets& clues are better earlier albums"
5,One of my most treasured records,I agree with everyone here - this is something very special. I don't know I'd say that everything is on the very highest level - Kind of Blue doesn't do it for me as some of the other tracks do - but Gurtu's solo on Mother Tongues is one of the greatest things I've ever heard. I'm not a fan of everything Mclaughlin and Gurtu have done but this record transcends stylistic boundaries to become something profoundly expressive and illuminating.
4,Heavenly...,"I am not particularly a fan of opera but do realize it's merit. I also appreciate the talent of it's artists. This 2 disc set offers a wide, wisely chosen selection from most of the popular operas, performed by most of the world's greatest singers, present and yesteryear. Yes, you will find legends such as Maria Callas to Pavarotti to the up and coming Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu; sharing space on these discs. Economically, I was able to obtain this set for under ten bucks. My research could not find a more varied set with such a stellar roster at any price. It will impress any novice to seasoned collecter. I wish that EMI annotated the set better, a brief synopsis of each track would have tutorial value. The sound reproduction flows seemlessly from track to track."
4,blend of great opera for novice or opera buff!,Beautiful music for anyone. Even those I know who generally dislike opera have taken an interest! These are truly highlights of some of the greatest peices...breathtaking voices...relaxing and yet movingingly passionate. I reccomend this for anyone wanting a varied and yet stunning collection.
4,the bottom line is Janis is wonderful,"I enjoyed this album even though the quality of the sound isn't all that great and the backup singers are sometimes flat. Really off key. But the interview and extra live songs of ""At Seventeen"" and ""Society's Child"" at the end of the album make up for any of that. As always, Janis gives and gives. You'll enjoy this album if you like live albums. Yes, we would like a current live album, but just more of Janis is the most important thing."
3,Wish Ian would do a current live album...,"This album dates from 1979/1980, when Ian was having huge success overseas and less so in the USA. Unfortunately, due to the Bottom Line's recording methods (could it really have been cassette?!), the fidelity is just all right. It's an interesting illustration of where Ian was at that time, and her use of backing vocals is exquisite. However, I wish she'd make good on her long-threatened ""current live album"", because since she's been touring solo her guitar work and vocals have become something to reckon with! Still, it's apparent why Chet Atkins cites her as ""a genius"" and people like Michael Hedges bowed before her playing skills (even if her guitar work is only beginning to develope here). The songs are much what you would expect, the stage rap is non-existent - all in all I'd prefer something more current."
5,psychosomatic gut wrencher,"I've been a fan of professional ansgt for years. In a way she reminds me of Dinah Washington in her ""Drinking Again"" period! This takes be back tearfully through past mistakes and I hope it is therapuetic!"
4,A good book for learning embroidery,"Whether you are a child or an adult just getting started on embroidery, this is a good book to have. Stitches are clearly explained and illustrated. However, while the book is full of pictures of embroidery projects, very few patterns are actually included. If it's ideas you want, this book is bursting with them. But if you are looking for detailed instructions for embroidery projects,then you should get a pattern book. Still, this book is a must-have because the designs are simply fun and so doable. Another wonderful Klutz crafts book."
2,Not what I expected...,"I can get ""beginner knowledge"" in several places online, and in books I already own. I bought the book mostly for the iron on transfers that were included. The back & front cover photographs showed lots of darling designs on the child-models'clothes. Only a few patterns were included in this book, which I feel was deceptive of the publisher."
4,No secrets to tell or keep,"This album opens with its biggest hit BAD CASE OF LOVIN' YOU(DOCTOR,DOCTOR). That would also be Robert Palmer's first #1 hit of his career and an ""addiction""* in 1989,a decade after the release of SECRETS. CAN WE STILL BE FRIENDS was on the hit parade for a while also. That was written by Todd Rundgren who recorded the song himself. I love the harmonica heard in IN WALKS LOVE AGAIN. WHAT'S IT TAKE? became an ""addiction"" also. All the other songs are very good. The cover illustrates Palmer in a pencil sketch,shaving. Inside the CD booklet and on the LP inner sleeve,is an actual black and white photo of Palmer shaving with shaving cream on his face and a razor in one hand. I dedicate this album to the memory of Palmer who died suddenly of a heart attack on September 26,2003. * This version is slightly different than the SECRETS version. It sounds like it was recorded in a garage also,the word ""loving"" appears in the title rather than the apostrophe on the SECRETS version."
4,Sound Quality very REAL.,"""Can We Still Be Friends?"": I have listened to the above mentioned Robert Palmer CD and I find the sound very real and exact on my playback through a BOSE speaker system. The music is displayed in a broad spectrum of sound, and I am quite pleased with the effect. I am not as alarmed as others who have given the ""remastering"" a poor rating. Enjoy. DDJ"
1,You won't Lust after this book,"I should have been suspicious since this book has hardly been reviewed in the press. After reading it, it's clear why it has been virtually ignored. In short, it is pure dreck. There is lots of sex but that does not make for a good book. The author fails to develop any of the characters, choosing to try to titillate readers rather than engage us emotionally."
1,Not what I had expected,"I really didn't like the book, it did not have my attention and by the last half of the first chapter I was bored. I wouldn't recommend this book as a remainder. It would be best to use this book as a door stopper."
2,This got published?,That's really all I can say. I'm stunned that something so amateurish found its way to the printing press!
1,"Oh, puh-leeze!","The scenes on the porno set read like some bored housewife's fantasy. I kept rereading them and laughing my head off. The book is awful, only worth buying for a laugh."
1,could not finish this,"Although Sanders can put a sentence together just fine, this novel never gets off the ground. It's totally glib and soulless and flat... I couldn't connect to any of the characters, got very annoyed at the self-conscious prose and irritating narrator, gave it a hundred pages and gave up."
3,Not great,I like regular expos but I have to say I was disappointed by this ones. The ink is gray insteadof black and they lose threads as you write making your script look bad.
5,nice!,very fine point and is dark too and the give you an good amount of pens too.i would buy it again but with the amount they give you i really don't think ill need to buy any anytime soon.
5,Happy Customer!,"Nothing bad to say, very satified.!For the price you could not go wrong, this was a supply need for my Son school."
1,Terrible Markers,I recieved the box of 12 markers. They write very lightly as if they had already been used for 2 weeks or dried out. The hassle to return them is not worth it. I was very disappointed with this product. I was also disappointed at the steps I would have to take to return it.
3,Markers fine but one missing,The markers worked fine but one was missing. It isn't worth the effort and time to return it just for one marker.
5,Gift,"Gave to kids teachers for Christmas gifts. The teachers appreciated the new markers. They came nicely packaged, ready for giving."
4,Very informative,"The End of Software is a well written book about the opportunities and challenges of Software as a Service (SaaS). Not only does it go over key concepts, but it illuminates these with apt examples.Software as a Service has tremendous potential and this book explains why.The book focuses definitely more on the benefits of SaaS and does not cover some of the challenges that SaaS has, e.g. usability, service integration and others. HTML is very good for several scenarios, but it does fall short in some areas and simply should not be used. But today with Flash/Flex and Silverlight there are solutions that address several of these short comings in the usability area. Similarly, integration products make it easier to integrate SaaS solutions with on-premises software, so the barriers for getting more SaaS solutions to the market are getting less and less.For anyone getting a good grounding on SaaS I can definitely recommend this book."
3,uggh..,"I got this only because it had Nick Frost. It's as if they filmed the entire show in one week in Florida. Like the BBC is like, here Nick, we'll give you this free vacation, if you film this show whilst you're there. Simon Pegg was great in the bonus features. As another poster said, it's only great IF you like Nick Frost. If I were you though, I'd buy Hyperdrive instead!"
1,never came /waited 6 weeks!!!!!,"avoid rarewaves.com ltd at all costs //product never shows up and they give you no way to track it! i'm sure robert palmer is just great , going to best buy to get cd right now! I have already waited 6darn weeks!"
3,A family's view,"My Aunt was one of the women this book was written about. For the people who feel the women weren't ""honored"" or the families were intruded on, they are misinformed or just ignorant. Mr. Mitrione was respectful and showed great concern to try to get details correct for our family's sake. For those who feel he just got too close to the families involved to write an objective book, that's your opinion. I have to disagree. I feel this was an important piece needed to bring a personal side to this cold, senseless crime.Thank you Mr. Mitrione for acknowledging our pain and feelings. We miss Theresa every day."
3,Suddenly Gone,"Overall this book is ok reading. The beginning starts out talking about the first murders and the reading is very interesting, but as the book progressed, there were spots in the book that were so long and boring. For the most part, the boring parts talked about how the police weren't able to find any evidence or what had to be done in order to find the evidence. I guess the book wasn't made to be extremely interesting in the first place. It was made to tell the stories of the murdered girls in Kansas and show the loss of their families. Other than those boring spots, the book was actually quite good. The author was very descriptive and always gave a good sense of what was going on. I beleive that this author told the story of what happened to these four girls really well. I give a lot of credit to Dan Mitrione for taking on this project and going through all of the trouble of interviewing all of the people involved with this case to accurately tell his story."
4,Good book and worth the read.,"I have read the commments on this book and I disagree. I found it easy fast-paced reading, not confusing or boring."
3,Pretty good book,"I'm just wondering if the writer is the former FBI agent who spent time in prison for drug trafficking? I think he was working as an undercover agent in Miami when he was caught. I don't honestly know how various agencies can place people in the position of trying to catch the ""bad guys"" and not expect them to become completely enmeshed in their lifestyle. If this is the same guy, when I knew him he was genuinely a good man and in my opinion was set up. You can't pretend to be one of the dealers wearing cheap shoes and a Timex."
1,Very poorly written,"This is one of the worst true crime books I've read. The narrative is disjointed and hard to follow. There is very little information about the psychology of the killer. The writing is insulting to the reader - it almost seems as though the book was written for children. If you read a lot of true crime like I do (Ann Rule, etc.) then you probably won't enjoy this book - it is horrendous writing. However, this case of Richard Grissom, probably the most heinous murderer in the history of Kansas, deserves more attention."
2,"Still remembering Joni, Christine and Theresa","The book Suddenly Gone, was not the best I have read. I knew two of these girls and why Grissom wont give the families a chance to locate and burry the victims is beyond me. This case brought to life the Death Penalty in the state of KS. And if not for one mans driving force through it all its hard to say that Grissom would have been convicted. Thank you Paul Morrison, for caring so much for the girls and the families. I am from Overland Park Ks. and also know that Grissom most likely killed at least one other girl, Terri. Our town was in tears as the search continued for years. If you didn't live through that trial and feel first hand what went on you can't possibly know the effect it had and still has on many of the KCMO and KCK Overland Park and Olathe Ks areas. You are still loved and missed so very much. Pasha Oswalt"
1,"Pass on this book; agenda-driven, no real guts","Was definitely a mistake to buy this on Monday. It's Friday now and the only thing I bought all week that I wish I hadn't. No guts to this book, no soul. No guts, no glory. Very much an agenda-driven book. And no scope. Pass on it."
1,"Paratrooper: Tucker is Right. Scott, Parenti and Olds Cowered Under Fire.","I was there. Tucker is correct. Parenti has no call whatsoeverto write the bulljive smack he does in this book about MikeTucker. Ian Olds, Garrett Scott, and Christian Parenti allhid behind a gun truck in the middle of the day, on thatmission. 9 Jan. 04, Fallujah. I saw it. I was there. Thisparatrooper knows. And damn right, Mike Tucker has all theright in the world to set the record straight. And heis the only one who has returned to Iraq, in deep, to honorour warriors. Fitting that he does not cast any stones inhis books on war at journalists, because Tucker understandsthat journalists are not the story, the warriors are.A Paratrooper. Alpha Company, 1st - 505th, 82nd Airborne."
2,Pros/Cons,"Pros:- Same great art style as found in ""Kite""- Engaging new character- Good voice acting/dubbing- Somewhat continues the original storyline- Not as bleak as ""Kite""Cons:- Unfinished feature (where's the other half???)- Sci-fi elements feel out of place- No ending, no resolution- No big set pieces, the action has been toned down"
4,great shoes,"I've had 3 pairs of these over the years. The first design was slightly different and the most comfy, but the newer design is still great. I am a prof dancer and have horrible feet. I can walk around NYC in these for awhile without a problem. Normally I wear the heck out of them, and they last for a summer and a half. It's always been worth buying a sparkly new pair when I wear 'em out. They run true to size and my calloused and bunioned feet don't pinch or squeeze."
5,"EXCITING, TIGHT, UPBEAT MASTERS","I bought this album a month ago and it hasn't come out of my mustang since! These guys are masters of their instruments, so the playing is thrilling and subdued all at once. Joe H. never loses the soft, ice-cream sweet tone of his wind even as he wraps scales at a hundred miles an hour around the tight, together big band. And Joe H. is competent enough to share the limelight...expert bass, drums, and piano weave excellent improvisations to evcite the analytical side of the brain while lifting the spirits. Play this three times and find yourself singing along to the very melodic improvs. The excellent production, the chrystal clear cymbals, makes this one to play at full volume. This is happy music that bears repeated listenings."
1,BAD! Endlessly rebooted Treo,"This product does not work on Treo 650. It sent my phone into an endless cycle of reboots, I ended up having to do a hard reset to remove the application.The AIM Mobile and AOL Mobile both did not work!!!!!!"
2,"American Dragster, The Complete Second Season",What a difference from season one. This is to general and not as intimate asthe first. Very disappointed. They treated the The Nitro championship like itwas nothing. Season one was exciting to watch how the drivers and their crewsgot to the final race of the year at Pomona 2005. This disk set of season 2treated Pomona 2006 in about 2-3 minutes-talk about a let down. The productionof season 2 is a 180 from one. Big disappointment all around. Season 1 I wouldgive 5 stars this maybe a 2. MN
4,Memories of the Future,Minimalist and ethereal but interesting dubstep. There are several artists in this genre who are moving beyond what to some looks like regular dub records.Interesting vocals mixed into the music I agree with others that the effect is eerie.
1,just to balance out the reviews,"I bought this one on the strength of the remix on Burials album.I found Kode 9s beats to be disappointing (plastic sounding boring toy) and Space Ape to be underwhelming (same boring lyrics repeated on repetitious boring subjects - not bringing anything new to played out technophic genre).If you dont have Linton Kwesi Johnsons best of album, and the Last Poets ""This is Madness"" buy those first before you pass judgement on my review of space ape.There are dozens of obvious dubstep CDs that should illustrate how Kode 9 lames out on this one. Ive heard some great stuff by him on comps and podcasts - but this isnt it."
3,BETTER COFFEE THAN OUT OF A VENDING MACHINE,"It is supposed to be ""better coffee than a millionaire's money can buy"" according to the jingle I heard countless times on radio and TV in the 1960s. Well, let's not get carried away.This coffee is reputed to have been used daily in Manhattan for decades, since 1932, at the ""Chock Full O'Nuts"" coffee shops that peppered Midtown for nearly half a century until 30 years ago. We can, of course, still purchase it at our local grocery. It does have a strong but somewhat mellow taste for instant coffee. If I can't find any Yuban Instant I will settle for this one, but at home I won't drink instant and hopefully neither will you.This is a good product [better than most] and a good value, but Yuban Instant is much better though it does cost about 1/3 more and virtually any fresh ground brew would be an improvement."
1,Unimpressed,"I am not a coffe expert by no means, but my husband loves coffee and he said it had a ""weird"" after taste, what ever that means, so he was very unimpressed of the 'ole New York tradition. I can not verify his review, because he says and I quote:"" Lisa likes a little coffee with her cream and sugar! But if you have been to NY and loved their coffee, this wil be the product for you."
4,Staying Off Cruise Boats,"Sea stories have long been among my favorite subjects. The Outlaw Sea was a title I ran across by happenstance, and I'm very glad of this. It is a very interesting book, and presents a well-documented set of facts. After reading this, I do not see myself riding any cruise boats. I'm going by airplane!"
2,Lacks a unifying theme,"This book is a compilation of previously published materials that lack a unifying theme. Although the information presented is interesting, the author fails to tie together the topics into a meaningful whole. In the end, he reaches no conclusions. Worth reading from the library, but I wouldn't buy the book again."
3,You will not want to go on a cruise after reading this,"This is one scary book. Pirates, murders, breakups at sea, the loss of the huge ferry Estonia with many innocent passengers and so on. It is well written, but it is sort of like if somebody wrote a book about all the people who had been horribly murdered in public restrooms. I don't know how many of those there have been in the last 100 years, but let's say there were fifty and suppose I were to gruesomely describe ten of those. After reading that book you'd never be able to walk into the men's (or ladies) room again without getting the shudders. You'd likely be buying adult Huggies to avoid the whole possiblity of having to take the chance.Well, that's the way this book is. It's scary, and after you read it you will have to think twice about getting within a hundred miles of any large body of water. That's you, of course. Now I live on an island, so what the hell am I supposed to do."
2,Interesting stories but loosely connected,"This book reads like 4 or 5 magazine articles that have been strung together. Each article focuses on some sort of disaster involving the seas - ship wreck due to poor maintenance, oil spills, piracy, loss of life in a ferry disaster, and the tear down of old ships in India. There is a loose connection between the articles involving chaos on the seas (mostly man-made but also natural) but not enough to make a coherent book. There are times when I wondered what the point of the book was besides passing on some interesting stories. In the introduction he tried to link the ""outlaw sea"" to terrorism but that idea was never reintroduced or significantly supported.Read the book if you're interested in maritime disasters. Skip the chapters that don't interest you because none are essential. (The Estonia ferry disaster drags on for over a hundred pages and I was never quite sure what the point was.)"
2,Outlaw Sea,"Disappointed. Title is great, but content is lacking. Mostly an excruciating recap of some notable maritime tragedies rather than a discussion of the issues associated with governance of the seas, UNCLOS, inability of coastal states to manage their coastlines, flags of convenience, etc."
4,Review,"Hi , I can't review this book because I never received it ! All attempts to try to contact amazon failed .This sucks!"
3,Good if shallow read,"The book begins strongly, colorfully describing the byzantine world of ship registry, possible terrorism, and modern-day pirates. But when it turns to maritime disasters, the author chooses a selection of ship sinkings which take entirely too much of the book. His exhaustive description of the wreck and great loss of life of the auto ferry Estonia in 1994 takes up almost an entire third of the book and exhausts the reader. And somehow he misses the point of the book. The book ends on stronger ground with his coverage of the largely unregulated salvage of hundreds of commercial vessels each year, raising important ecological and social issues, though the book kind of dribbles to a close as if the author needed to complete the book by page 239.I liked the book for all that. The author's coverage is a bit shallow (pun intended) of a vastly important and interesting subject. He would do well with a follow-up, picking up where this one leaves off."
3,"Cioran, Briefly","Cioran is quite an interesting character but this book is not for everyone and, in fact, not for very many. It is dense stuff that might be read, say, if you were imprisoned for a lenghty time with only one book. Read his aphorisms instead."
1,Poet-Philosopher manqué,Cioran has neither the brevity and precision of a successful poet nor the intellectual rigour and integrity of an original philosophical thinker... in short he is but a grandiloquent poet-philosopher manqué strutting his stuff in the overheated and stultifying intellectual atmosphere of a Parisian café.
5,excellent book ... read it !,The best medicine for your problems is to laugh at them. Rosaura Rodriguez' good humor and thruthful description of a divorce situation makes this book a must read.
2,Malvenida al Club de las divorciadas,"Con un humor acido, esta mujer se mofa de las miserias que ocurren con y durante el proceso de divorcio. Tuve la oportunidad de leer este libro de una amiga que se está divorciando y puedo asegurar que no es para nada algo para reirse, salvo que uno lo mire desde la vereda de enfrente. Es como si uno se riera de la muerte de un familiar - algo de esto ocurre en el divorcio -. Recomiendo que lean la revista Humor Argentina, o sus colaterales, que hacen lo mismo."
3,fun for hamsters,"I am very clumsy and dropped it and needed to super glue a few parts together (no where accessible to the hamsters). But ever since then it has been so much fun. It sits to the exterior of the wheel and you can watch them run, and it is very quiet. The hamsters seem to love it and I know those that watch them in it do. Highly recommend (try not to be clumsy)."
1,misfires,"These metaphysical wet dreams will delight sulky teenagers and juveniles of all ages, but adults will agree with Rimbaud's own judgement: ""It's all slop."" The Varese translation leaves most of the (rumored) music behind in the original French; what remains is the prose end of the prose-poem equation. I found these pieces supremely boring. Perhaps if I cared about the Rimbaud myth I would read these with different eyes-- but I don't, and therefore what I find is faux passion and histrionic hormones. Add a stilted English to this mixture and the result is malodorous. Not recommended."
4,No pense que me gustaría tanto,"Cuando una amiga me recomendó el libro, no pensé que sería tan bueno. En realidad me gustó lo bien caracterizados que estuvieron los personajes tanto de Jamie como de Shenna. Jamie con su caracter de señor feudal no puede dominar a la bellísima Sheena, y ésta a su vez pese a que siente que debe odiar a Jamie por creerlo un barbaro, tampoco logra controlar su atracción por él. Felicito a la escritora, voy a seguir leyendo otros de sus libros."
5,A Must for Any Violin Music lover,"This is truly an excellent CD, a must for any violin music lover. If you are learning the violin, you may feel that you still have a very long way to go; but because of Repin's inspiration, you know it is not impossible. The sound quality is also excellent. Any violin music lover will regret for not having listened to this one."
3,I Cannot Ignore My Ears,"I am in accord with the Grammophone review of the album of violin delicacies performed by young and burgeoning Russian soloist, Vadim Repin. All in all, I cannot add anything in positive to a review that was so complete. His rawness is appealing. His phrasing tasteful and even refreshing. A violinists, violinist. Yet I have a problem. Intonational problems are evident all throughout the album. It may have been the recording style that was used, or some tweaking or lack thereof in the studio that had altered some intonation. Or then again, I could be going tone deaf. Specifically on the Zapateado track, he is missing a lot of harmonics and the arpeggio's are a bit sloppy. Sustained notes tail off in artistic phrasing, but lack intonational stability. An old violin teacher of mine once said, ""never stop listening to what you are playing."" I am wondering if Repin or the engineers at ERATO were really listening to the final tracks?"
4,Almost perfect,"With one exception I found the Psion Revo almost perfect for me. For several years I had searched for an alternative to a Palm with a keyboard, PC sync (MS Outlook) and an affordable price.My Psion Revo does it all for me - except for the lack of backlit display. It set up easily and quickly with excellent documentation, syncs quickly and perfectly with my PC and MS Outlook and comes with it's own version of a decent word processor, spread sheet, contacts, agenda, e-mail, phone dialer, calculator, and more. A modem is also available for an additional cost. It looks good and even feels good in my hand and is small enough to fit in my pocket - though I don't trust any expensive piece of equipment in a pocket. This rates five stars if only it had a back lit display-but we can't have it all, can we. I do not work for or own stock in the Psion company, but I LIKE this product. Hopefully my feelings will be the same two years from now."
3,revo review,"the revo is great feature-wise, except for one thing...no backlighting! this means that in the dark, you can't do anything! i'm thinking cinemas, pubs, darkened meeting rooms, etc. it's quite annoying. also, it's pretty tricky using the 'pen' and typing, especially if you don't have a flat surface to put it down on. other than that, it's pretty neat, especially the design."
5,Small yet powerful and it has a keyboard!!,"If you are looking for a PDA to store contacts, e-mail, to-do lists, etc., look no further! I had been looking around for a PDA to suit my needs, but I didn't like the Palm's or Visor's. Then I found the Revo (VERY popular in Europe) and decided to do some reseach on the tools, speed, and available applications. Then, once I saw the wonderful price here on Amazon (about $100 less than everyone else) I figured I'd order it and give it a try. Talk about amazing...lots of free/shareware apps on the web, and lots of forums to get answers to your questions. I would highly recommand this PDA. Put aside your Palm and Visor and check out this PDA with a keyboard. In addition, I have yet to see anyone complaining about any hardware issues! If it isn't in stock (Gee, I wonder why? ;), wait for it. It will be worth it!"
2,Reliability nightmare,Great product with lousy reliability. I've had the motherboard and the battery-pack replaced in the last 6 months. I understand that the reliability problems led to Psion dropping the product line. Do thus not buy!
4,Same as Diamond Mako,"A great non-Palm PDA, but under-marketed in the US as the Diamond Mako.I've bought 4 of them on auction sites like eBay -- everyone in my family wanted one. Prices there are competitive. Many people got these as a throw-in with Compaq desktops a year ago, and never used them.Thumb-typing on the keyboard is easy. Uses easy stylus/touchscreen commands, plus has well-thought-out keyboard commands. Comes with great built-in programs, but add-on software is hard to find.Synch cradle attaches by a serial port, not USB. I synch and recharge every day or two, so I don't lose much if I drop it in a pond. When that happened, I headed back to the auction site for a replacement."
2,"Like a Jaguar: sleek, in need of constant tinkering","The Revo reminds me of a sleek product from another British company: the Jaguar. Like the Jag, the Revo is beautifully designed (including the EPOC OS) and amazingly powerful for its size. It'a also like a Jag in that you spend an awful lot of time tinkering with it to get it to run like it should. The problem is that the internal (and very hard to access) rechargable batteries are notoriously temperamental, meaning that you'll turn the thing on when it supposedly has a decent charge and...nothing. The Revo bulletin boards are filled with similar tales of woe. A pity, because this would otherwise have been an amazing machine."
4,Classic Merle,"This is a classic Merle Haggard album. I love the song ""I'll Never Swim Kern River Again"""
5,Aun para los gustos mas exigentes,"Otra gran colaboracionde Bebu Silvetti y PlacidoDomingo. El resultado deldisco ha sido favorable.La musica es romantica,y los arrglos son fenomenales.Domingo hace un buen trabajo;su voz logra la claridad queestas canciones requieren.Yo prefiero mucho mas la operay la musica clasica, y estedisco ha probado ser hastapara el gusto de los mas exigentes."
3,not as cute as it looks online,it's made well and works well. guess it just wasn't what i was expecting. not worth paying to ship back.
1,The only thing who looks like SH## IS YOU MO####,"THIS GAME IS SIMPLY A RIP-OFF ALL CARS GAMES, AND FOR THE REVIEW WHO SAID MARIO KART LOOKS LIKE SH## YOU DON'T HAVE IDEA THAN MARIO KART IS BETTER THAN THIS TRASH."
3,road runner video,"We were pretty pleased with this product. There were a few parts of the video that were messed up and it was supposed to be new, but all in all it was ok."
5,This is a great deck!,"The idea of pairing fairy tales with the tarot is inspired! I sat down and carefully read each tale and interpretation for each card. It took days but it was worth it. I saw many cards in a whole new way. This is not a lightweight children's deck as I feared but has powerful, grown-up, and sometimes dark meanings. The three of swords had a particularly disturbing story while the 10 of cups simple and delightful. You can tell alot of work went into collecting these stories. The illustrations are beautiful and thought provoking and all in all, I find it an excellent deck. I also must add that the books published Magic Realist Press included in their kits are exceptionally fine. I love the glossy pages and the way the book just falls right open. It makes reading them a pleasure. Thanks!"
4,"Quick delivery, unexpected packaging","I was surprised at the quick delivery from Florida to Washington state. I was expecting a bottle of capsules, but instead the 60 capsules were packaged in a zip type bag with a label, heat sealed for shipment. I might have done more research about how many capsules for my money, as for the money I expected 100 capsules, but quantity was not listed in the description. The quality of the root seems to be fine."
5,Awesome!,Blue Skies is a fresh (even after these several decades) recording of standards; my indifference to the all-to-familar or never-enchanting quickly melted with Cassandra Wilson's singing.
2,Not One Of Wilson's Best,"Cassandra Wilson singing jazz standards is kind of appealing on the surface, but a closer listen will reveal that this is actually not what she's good at doing. I wouldn't call her a ""jazz"" singer anyway, because for me, Shirley Horn was the best female jazz vocalist of all-time.Wilson does show an impressive range with these selections, but again, I don't think this is her forte at all. The musicians are great: Mulgrew Miller, Lonnie Plexico, and Terri Lynne Carrington. They are all fantastic, but Wilson's voice simply does not fit into this kind of setting.I think anyone interested in Cassandra Wilson should check out ""New Moon Daughter,"" which as far as I'm concerned is her best recording."
2,1 good song,"the title track is what made me buy this album, the rest of the album sounds nothing like that song and i was very disappointed."
5,Stuff you knew all along but were afraid to admit!,"There are no big secrets in this book, but there's the very obvious stuff that we choose to ignore. Now that things are starting to quit working or stiffen up, I'm looking for answers on how to fix it or prevent it...not medicate it. These are the easy to understand rules about how the choices we make affect everything we do, now and later. If we don't start making better choices, the long term effects will be far more serious. This book pumps you up and gets you excited about taking better care of yourself."
4,Wow!,"Few films can leave you feeling destroyed afterwards. This incredibly powerful film is so well realized, that you may be stunned for days. About a disfunctional suburban family. It is truly horrifying. Not by content, but delivery. Do not miss this film. When I saw it, horror diehards were clearing the theatre and my girlfriend vomitted. Not a date good date movie."
3,"Not bad, but definitely not for everyone!","Consists of a series of five short films by independent artists around North America. The first four are okay... the final film, entitled aptly enough, ""Cutting Moments,"" is one of the most disturbing (yet well made) films I've ever seen. When I saw it in the theatre, many people had to actually run out to avoid being sick. Gore-hounds and admirers of independent cinema will love it, others will not. Special effects by Tom Savini."
3,"Hit and Miss, but worth a look...","Anyone who grew up in an Aladdin's Castle or similiar arcade will be a fan of this cartridge. Frogger is classic and translates well onto the GBA. The same goes for Scramble and even Time Pilot is enjoyable up to a point. Although if you ever played Time Pilot you'll definitely miss the joystick. Gyruss is okay, it's difficult to see the attacking ships and that makes for easy kills on you. I never liked Yi-ar Kung Fu in the arcade and that feeling hasn't changed. Winning any match feels random at best and controlling your character is mostly about button-mashing. Rush'n Attack is kind of fun if somewhat repetitive. The cold war theme is amusing and nostalgic. So it's 3, possibly 4 out of 6. That's not bad. It's not a homerun, but it's not bad."
4,price fluctuation,"I bought this for a friend in nov. 2008 and we had a blast playing. I decided to get one for myself --- I find it hard to believe that it was 14.99 on 11/13/08 and today, 12/31/08 it is 50.99 for the exact game. It's not like it's a different version or an upgraded version. I can see some price fluctuation but that's insane."
4,Radical,"I'll be honest, I only picked this up for Frogger. The other games are good though. Since getting back into video gaming, I've gotten decidedly retro in picking up games. So anything that was fairly new when I was young is fair game. Not that today's games aren't awesome, there's just a certain cool cheese factor in revisiting games from my youth. If, like me, you are just getting back into the video game race, or you have kids that you want a good decent set of games for, this is it."
4,"Impressed reader from Plainfield, CT","I received this book as gift from my son and didn't think I'd actually use the recipes - I'm more of a fan of the musicians. Whoe, the recipes are terrific and this is such a phenominal cause to help. Can't wait for another book like this! Peace, rock on, and cook for a cause!"
2,plants,These plants are ok but white plants are hard to keep clean and when I was cleaning them they fell apart. Sorry
2,Maybe better for older kid,"This was a gift for my two year old niece. My sister said it was a bit confusing with so many parts, and they weren't really sure what to do with it."
1,seller good....toy bad....,"no problems with the seller it showed up on time and in good working order. the toy just doesn't do what the manufacture says it will do. sucks, but cool bath toys are really hard to find."
1,"Worthless drill bit, should have bought the import","The corner chipped off this bit on the FIRST hole. This was using a full size Delta drill press and running the correct speed in mild steel. Don't bother with these, buy the cheap imports, they actually hold up better and are way cheaper."
2,Argh !,"Trilogies can reward a movie viewer with expansive character and plot development - witness the Godfather. Similarly, Infernal Affairs has a part 2 chronology previous to part 1 both with fully realized stand alone plots that complement each other as a set, albeit not on a grand multi-generation and geographic scale as Coppola's classic epic. Unfortunately after a confused first and a second somewhat forced attentive watching part 3 remained vague and annoying with its choppy flashback and flash forward vignettes which have little cohesive coherence except as related to parts 1 & 2. The twist ending IMO seems unbelievable and unsatisfying. In sum part 3 of Infernal Affairs appears to be a quickie afterthought knock off exploitation of the excellent parts 1 & 2."
4,Felt forced,"Acting and movie was great but the overall storyline felt forced. This is part 3 of a 3-part serie and if you want to, I would recommend starting with Part 1 and subsquent part so you won't be disappointed by the earlier parts that was released later."
3,Too much Dizzy,"I found Getz just overwhelmed on this CD. Moreover Dizzy sounded like he was in a sock, too constrained with the mute. An unbalanced sound, that was not pleasing to me."
2,I should have saved my money,"I have been a life long lover of old school Nazareth and this CD set has some great songs on the first CD, but from there it goes down for me. On the next two CDs there is only one song that I liked. ""Gone down train"". The rest of the songs are pretty much from raygay to pop. Which isn't what I think of when I think of Nazareth. I should have saved my money and bought three older Nazareth CDs."
3,War-Lite,"To echo the comments of reviewers ""wanchob"" and ""a reader from Israel,"" Martin Van Creveld has done exactly what he stated he would in presenting ""The Art of War."" Long on breadth and short on depth, this work touches on the ideas of the most well-known military theorists in history. It is a good starting point for new students of military history, and a convenient reference. I was pleased to see a listing of notable military thinkers at the end of the book, as I was a list of suggested further reading.Once the reader has absorbed what Creveld has to say, they may seek a more detailed analysis of war in, for example, Donald Kagan's ""On the Origins of War"" (Anchor Books, 1995). For a discussion on a true theory of combat, a good companion work is Trevor Dupuy's ""Understanding War: History and Theory of Combat"" (Paragon House, 1987)."
4,There is potential,"First of all, Langdon Reid and Wil Reid may be the sons of ""Statler Brothers"" Harold and Don Reid, but this ain't their Daddy's Album. I am not fond of country music, but I am interested in Grandstaff and I sincerely hope they make a go of their career. If you are looking at Grandstaff to be ""Statler Brothers part 2"", sorry you are looking in the wrong place. Even their rendition of ""How are things in Clay, Kentucky"" (a Statler tune) differ greatly from previous recordings I have heard. This CD shows their voices are great and they have dramatic potential and they will appeal to the ""Alan Jackson"" type country fans more than the older Statler crowd."
4,Good music,"There are a couple of great ballads on this CD along with a few rockin' country tunes. The songs sound so familiar, it's easy to listen to. I enjoyed it very much."
4,"The feast is full and varied, as always.","Definitely a deeply satisfying purchase. Momus is an artist worth coming back to over and over, if only to see what's changed. As a huge fan of Nick Currie's early body of work, I found his drift into more electronic forms of music (many years back now!) disappointing at first. But I was rewarded in sticking with it, as I came to realise his music will always be a reflection of the ever-changing whirlpool of modern cultures and classical works that he so relentlessly immerses himself in - and therein lies it's charm."
4,as always... momus rocks!,This cd was especially exciting coupled with momus touring the u.s.. It's an excellent addition for the momus connoisseur.
4,"nice, goes with all work outfits",had this watch for a while and and is pretty sturdy. because it has silver and gold it goes with all of my work outfits. keeps good time.
2,"Decent explanation, no examples.","The author does a decent job explaining ISO requirements. Contrary to the other reviewer's claims, there are ""no"" examples in the book. Another useful tool would have been examples of ISO systems / process flowchart. Instead, the author tries to get you to buy his software if you want to see any example at all. I give the book 2 stars because it tries to do marketing instead of doing it's job of giving buyers useful information.Based on the title of the book ""ISO 9001 Requirements"", the author did do his job explaining what the requirements are. However, if you want to do ISO in order to improve the quality system of your company, as opposed to just getting a piece of paper saying that your company is ISO certified, then look for another book."
1,Lois Duncan could have done better!,I've read lots of Lois Duncans books and this is probably one of the worst. What I normally like about her books are the phsychic people and what they do. In this book the phsychic person didn't do much except get the image of the bleeding candle and oppose the club.I also think that no one in real life can be as twisted as Irene. There were also too many characters. I just couldn't keep up. Lois Duncan can do so much better.
2,it's ok,"Personally, I thought this book was kinda dumb. The plot was a little confusing and I didn't see the ""mystery"" in it. This book is a little disappointing, but read it if you're a fan of Lois Duncan."
3,it's okay,"it's not terrible. it's okay. it was very difficult and confusing to read in the beginning but afterward the story found its pace and became more readable. the ending is kind of disappointing because the book gets to worked up, you think that they're going to do something real evil and cruel, but what they do isn't quite as despicable as you'd think they'd do. it's a good effort, but in the end it disappoints."
5,I wish there were more books like this one!!!,"What a fascinating page turner! I loved the various charactors in this book and the plot was great! I also loved the surprise ending. The book is great from the first page to the very last page. Daughters of Eve is definately one of Duncan's best books. It ranks right up there with ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Don't Look Behind You."""
2,This book is terrible,I was very dissapointed when I read this book because I have loved all of the other books Lois Duncan has written. The plot is all about getting revenge and it puts down women so much that it really seems out dated.
4,"A great book, but hard to stay with the characters!","I read this book a week ago, and liked it a lot, but there were times when I didn't know who was who. There really isn't one main character, it's all of the members of Daughters of Eve. This book is still a good read."
3,Lois Duncan has written better books!,"The ending was bad and there was no thriller or scare in the book. I hated how they put down women in that book. I mean please, Lois could have done so much better! There was also no climax it seemed."
1,This is the most horrible book!,"Ok...I have read a lot of Lois Duncan books...in fact i've almost read all of them but this one was the worst...it had absolutely no plot and well just nothing to it! If you really want a good book by Lois Duncan then read ""Gallows Hill"" or ""Killing Mr. Griffin""!"
2,Daughters of Evil,"As a Lois Duncan fan, I must say that I am very disappointed by this book. There were a lot of grammatical errors and I was confused...no, disappointed by the ending. I felt betrayed. I did not like the idea of the evil teacher getting away with ""murder"". The way the girls treated that boy, shaving his head and etc., was VICIOUS. Eerie. Sick. This book is being removed from our reading list at the school where I teach. At first, I thought maybe the parent was overreacting. I am not for censorship and I feel that children should be able to read whatever they want, within certain boundaries. However, in the aftermath of the highly publicized violent school shootings, maybe this is not such a good idea. After thinking about the content a little more, maybe it does need to be removed. I was just very disappointed in this novel. The ending was off and I felt there could have been a better resolution."
1,This was a horrible book!,I had to do a book report and I picked this book because I thought it would be about murder or something. I was greatly disappointed by the entire story. The characters were well written but that was about it for this novel. The feminism was messed up and taken too far. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I only finished the book because I had to do a 75 point book report on it.
3,Slightly disappointed,"I have been a long time fan of Lois Duncan, reading her books over and over again. When I bought DOE I expected to be thrilled and hung in supense. I was dissapointed as the book took a while to build and when it did, it ended quickly."
3,Not as good as expected,"I've read many Lois Duncan books,but this was a bit of a disappointment. The story was just weird and twisted. I found myself,turning through some of the pages,and being bored. There were quite alot of characters,which caused alot of confusion. Sometimes,I forgot who they were and had turn back and see. The cover may seem interesting because it says ""they share everything"" but its really not. If you want to read something good read stranger with my face or the third eye."
2,Not Very Good,This book was weird. It had a very weak plot and was hard tokeep up with who was who. I would recommend not to read it. It didn'tend right either. It just left you hanging.
4,AWESOME,This book was da bomb! It was a very well written book. Though I give it only fours stars I loved it. If there had been more info. on how the girls did after this was done it would've gotten 5. Mrs. Duncan you did great on this book!!! Love ya bye-bye
3,By Day or Dusk,"The book Daughters of Eve was a very interesting book. I liked this book mostly for the fact that once I thought I knew what was going to happen the whole story changes. Most books that I read I can already tell what the ending is going to be. In the beginning of this book that was written by Lois Duncan was actually not that exciting, and I was thinking about getting a different book to read instead. Then right when I decided to get another book, it got really good. So if you like to read books that have a good ending then this book is for you, but if you are a reader that likes to have a book that is exciting from beginning to end then this book is not for you. Well if you are like me and like to have a book that has a really good ending then this is most defiantly this is the book for you. So if you like to be on the edge of your seat this is not the best book for you to read."
4,A Great Book,"I thought that this was a very good book. I'll admit that I thought it was a little difficult to get into, but after that I couldn't put it down. It showed me how one person can influence so many people. The ending was very suprising, but I liked it. Lois Duncan is a great writer and she really has a way of describing characters and situations. She is one of my favorite authors, and this book is just another reflection of her talent. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read."
3,"Not Duncan's best, not her worst","Daughters of Eve is a story about a club of girls who are encouraged by their faculty sponser to hurt all the men that hurt them. Under her tutalage they destroy a science lab and shave a boy's head. Other events in the novel include an overdose and a girl murdering her father. I think the teacher was crazy and took the girls down with her. Read it once, let it freak out, then pick up another one of Lois' book, a better one."
3,Wrong CD in package.,Ordered two identical CDs. One for me and one for gift. Mine was fine. CD for gift had other CD in case other than what was ordered. Not worth a return but ruined that Christmas gift!
5,Much more than Kitten On the Keys,"If you thought an album of Zez Confrey music would be track after track like Dizzy Fingers or Kitten On the Keys, you are in a for a pleasant surprise with this superb CD.The performances of the said party pieces are fast, furious and fun, but there are also some great blues renditions, and some lyrical, reflective pieces.I would have preferred if the CD had included a few more of the well-known pieces like My Pet, Poor Buttermilk and You Tell 'Em, Ivories, but the many pieces I had never heard of are interesting, and are played beautifully."
1,"Out of Date, need update for 2011!","Jan. 3, 2010 review: I started using Ultimate Employer by KnowledgePoint (now Administaff?) HR software in 1999? I swear they have NOT updated their software since then! As a small business, I rely on People Manager and it crashes my pc every time. When I call to ask if there is or will be an updated version they claim there is a new version. There never is, it's the same software. Intuit, yoohoo are you listening, we need HR software!"
1,Skips Horribly,I did return this item. Very few features..more importantlythis player skips at the slightest touch. Shop for another!Tom D.
1,It made me feel awful.,"When I started taking it, I thought everything was going ok, but I would get so exhausted day after day. My back ached all the time, I got headaches all the time and then...It made me start my period on CD22. I had very high hopes for this month since my HSG test came back with great results. Per my OBGYN, I stopped taking it and I'm just sticking with my Pregnitude that she recommended from the beginning."
1,"This doesn't Prmote fertility, ovulation and pregnancy!","I took this for 6 months and my period stop for six months. I cannot wait for another month because its abnormal. I took Norethindrone prescribed by my OB-GYN and my period came back. This product is not for real it will do you harm than good. I thought it will normalize my menstruation but its the opposite. If a woman doesn't menstruate for long months it would lead to endometriosis or ovarian cancer. I don't want this to happen to anyone buying this pill that is not approved by FDA. If it is effective, why until now it hasn't been approved by FDA?!!!!! I wasted my money of this and it endangers my life."
5,It made me ovulate....,It did make me ovulate again but unfortunately at the time there was no pregnancy and still none since we've stopped trying.
1,Don't,"I purchased this and used it for two months. No positive results. I also used fertile cm, it worked for the first three days but no results since then. None of these products actually helped us. TTC over a year now."
4,Hoping for a baby,"Ok... I was going to wait until I was actually pregnant to write a review but I couldn't! Im not pregnant yet but I can tell that this product is DEFINITELY doing something! I bought two bottles and started taking it on July 5 towards the end of my period. I experienced cramping in the beginning but they went away in about a week. When I came on my cycle again, July 24 in noticed way more fluid around ovulation time than usual. Now that I am on my cycle again, which started August 17, I noticed a change in my menstrual flow. The blood isn't dark, syrupy, and offensive in order like usual. So, I can definitely concluded that fertile aid is doing something! Oh... My cycles are very regular and fertile aid didn't interfere with that at all! :-)Now I am going to start trying to make a baby this month. Keep you posted. And wish me luck!"
4,IT REALLY DOES WORK,"MY PERIODS ARE VERY IRREGULAR...SINCE TAKING B/C I'VE HAD TO HAVE PROVERA TO MAKE ME START MY CYCLE. I WAS PUT ON CLOMID FOR 3 MONTHS WITH NO SUCCESS MY DOCTOR SAID SHE COULD NOT DO NOTHING FOR ME AND WANTED ME TO SEE A SPECIALIST. I'VE BEEN TAKING FERTILAID FOR 14 DAYS WITH SOME CRAMPS HERE AND THERE... BUT AS OF TODAY I'VE STARTED HAVING PERIOD LIKE CRAMPS AGAIN AND SOME SPOTTING...I NEVER THOUGHT THIS PRODUCT WOULD WORK, BUT NOW I SEE THAT IT REALLY DOES!!!! HOPEFULLY I CAN GET PREGNANT NOW!!!"
1,Threw me out of whack,"I had high hopes for this product, but I have to join in with those who said it threw their cycle into a tailspin. My husband had motility issues, but for good measure I thought I would take these supplements while we were TTC. I was regular and took this supplement for about three months before my cycle completely seemed to stop. I was very excited because I thought I was pregnant, but no. When I told my doctor that I had missed my period twice with negative results on pregnancy tests, she said to stop taking the supplements immediately, but I still missed my period for two more months. What's in that stuff?! I can't personally recommend this to others based on my experience. :-("
3,So Far So Good!,"I started taking this product about one month ago, So far I have not gotten pregnant but my period is regular again just after a few weeks of taking it. I will probably buy another bottle to see if it actually helps to get pregnant and not just regulate my period."
3,Use caution if you're regular ...,"TTC for two years, I've tried Clomid, injections, and one IUI so far. We decided to take a break and give FertilAid a try. When I'm not being treated by a doctor, my cycles are fairly regular at 35 days. On Day 22 my basal body temperature was still low, so I went in for an Ultrasound and discovered a functional cyst on my Left Ovary (an egg *tried* to ovulate this cycle, but turned into a cyst instead). There's no way to know if the cyst was caused by FertilAid, but just in case I have stopped using it. I'm happy for the many women who have had success with FertilAid, but I suspect it really depends on each person's individual cause(s) of infertility. These herbs are supposed to do weird things to estrogen & progesterone receptors, and in my particular case I don't think it's beneficial. If you're in the mood to try something different and are sick of doctors (like I was), then give it a try. I do like the 3x per day vitamin aspect."
5,Worked FIRST month!!!,"Product arrived within 5 days. I used this product with Fertili Tea and Pre-Seed. I have irregular cycles and a short luteal phase (8-10 days). Very late ovulation (ovulated on CD 26). We were ttc our first child for 6 months with no luck. Though it didn't regulate my cycle the very first month, it gave me my BFP!!!! I ordered a 2nd bottle but before I was even able to finish my first bottle, I had a smiley face on my HPT. Baby dust to you all.God bless..."
5,Worked for Me w/ Regular Cycles,"I was a little nervous to try this after reading that it had interrupted some women's already regular cycles. But my husband and I had been trying for 10 months with no luck. I took this for a month and got pregnant! I couldn't believe it! I did drink the tea for about 2 months prior with no luck, but one month of the pill form did the trick! I'm now 11 weeks pregnant :)"
1,Big Mistake,"I purchased Fertilaid after being on birth control pills for 15 years. Recently married, we decided to start trying to conceive. I was not sure what my cycle would be like off of birth control, so I thought why not try to regulate things right off the bat? I read all the great reviews about it and decided I would go for it. Big mistake! I started taking the pills and got my period right away which lasted 13 days!! (Normally my period was 3 to 4 days). I thought okay, maybe this is just the start of these pills ""normalizing"" my cycle who knows? Well I am still waiting for my period after 45 days now and have taken 2 pregnancy tests. Deff not pregnant. These pills have messed my cycles up and I am so annoyed. I stopped the pills and am still waiting for a period so that I can try to get back on track! I would not reccomend these vitamins if you are stopping the pill. Wait and see what your body will do on its own!! I feel like I have just wasted time I could have had on to TTC."
3,Complexion difference!!!,"I have PCOS, and have been taken this product for less than a week and so far I can see a difference in my complexion, I'm also taking a multivitamin which probably plays a role in this as well. But needless to say ""My skin has never looked so good. EVER(or at least since i started puberty and was diagnosed with PCOS)!"
5,Fertilaid is amazing!!,"I am on my third month of taking Fertilaid, and I love it! Before taking this, I would have spotting 7-11 days before my period began. Well, the last two months I have only had 2 days of spotting before. As someone who has had this spotting for the past 12 years, I am amazed. I highly recommend this product."
4,So far so good.,"I began taking FertilAid on the first day of my cycle because I was afraid it may work against me if I started it in the middle. I have been taking it for almost a month now, and I haven't had any side effects yet. I take one 3x a day, and I make sure to eat a little beforehand. I am 2DPO right now, and I could see a difference in my CM during. Another thing is that since I have started taking it, I have been in the mood constantly! We are not pregnant just yet, but this is my first cycle. I have faith that it will work!"
1,i dont think this works.... 3rd bottle already,"strange....i just dont think this works. i take vitex/ dong quai instead. let's see how that turns out.i do see that it helps regulate but has anyone had any success in getting pregnant??? and if so, how long did it take with the use of fertilaid?i am inclined to just trying one more bottle but since i have pcos, maybe it just isnt for me..."
1,Caution if you are regular....,I am sorry I didn't see the reviews about this product making your cycle irregular prior to my purchasing it. I have now been bleeding off and on for a month. I have been trying to conceive for 2.5 years and was willing to try anything. I only took one pill a day too instead of the recommended 3 per day. I would urge anyone who is regular to proceed with caution prior to taking this product.
3,"Didn't help, didn't hurt","I was hesitant to try this given the negative reviews, and because I ovulate regularly on my own. I purchased this product hoping to extend the length of my luteal phase, which is typically 10 days. After 4 months of taking as recommended, I didn't see a change in my cycle at all, so I stopped. I do take FertilCM as well and find that very helpful."
1,Screwed me up,I am 30 yrs old and my husband and I have been trying for a while now. I saw this product and the reviews seemed good so I bought it. I've always had regular cycles and if I'm late it's never more then a couple days. After taking this product not only did I not ovulate (I've been tracking with OPK's and BBT) but I've completely skipped my last period. That has NEVER happened to me! There is NO chance I am pregnant either. I saw my doctor and she recommended stopping it and simply taking prenatal vitamins.I am very disappointed.
1,Don't recommend at all!,"Was really excited when I came across this product from baby forums and everything. My husband and I are TTC and I went off the pill in February. Since then my period was kinda screwy the second month off the pill (1 week late) so about 1.5 months ago I decided to buy FertilAid (bought 3 months worth). Couldn't hurt, right? ha! I haven't gotten a period since I started taking this pill... Should have gotten it over 3 weeks ago. Although I've had PMS symptoms pretty much all the time which is super fun... Definately not pregnant, have had blood tests and all. I've decided to stop taking this and hope that I get my period back and am going to see if I can return the one unopened bottle for a refund. And yes of course there is the chance that the product isn't what is causing my missing period problem, but I've never missed a period in my life so I'm not taking any chances at this point."
3,"High Hopes, based on reviews","I think we all share similar stories. My husband and I have been TTC for the past 2-3 years. I have normal cylces and ovulate, but it just hasn't happend for us. We visited an infertility specialist, results were normal for both of us leaving us more confused as to why I can't get pregnant. After 3 IUI's,shots and doctor visits we have considered IVF for 2011 if we cannot conceive this year. I have pretty much tried everything. After reading several reviews for this product, I figured I'd give this one a chance. I ordered the 3 month supply pack. I received my order and have began taking the pills 3/9/10. Not bad, the capsules do not have a bad taste, smell and so far so good-no changes. The real test will be in the next few months. Hopefully, with good news to share! Baby dust for everyone... Good luck and for those that have acheived results, keep posting them! Your story and review is one of the reasons I decided to try this product. :)"
2,didn't work for me,"I tried one bottle for a month, it didn't help with my cycle at all. Donno if I need to try more but according to other reviews, it supposed to work in a few weeks.."
2,Fertilaid,"My hubby and I have been TTY for 2 years, I read reviews on Fertilaid and decided to try it. Started taking the pills yesterday so fingers crossed and prayers said!"
1,it didnt work,this do not work it work for most ppl and sum ppl it dont yhu will b best 2 save your money and juz go to a foertility doctor
2,Still waiting,I have been taking this product for about a month and still nothing. I have been hoping to become pregnant and when I found this product I thought for sure that it would help. After researching the product I finally ordered it and now I am still playing the waiting game. I can only hope that it actually starts to work and I become pregnant.
1,I wish I had known,"My husband and I have been ttc for a few months now. I read up on this product and decided to try it. I was really excited that my cycle was normal after only being off the pill for a month and just thought taking Fertilaid would only help us in trying to get pregnant. I started taking this product about a month and a half ago and did not ovulate this month. I thought at first that maybe it was just me, but now after reading all of the other reviews regarding non-ovulation, I now see what the problem is. If this is supposed to ""enhance"" your fertility, it should definitely not make it so that you don't ovulate. I bought another month of it a couple of weeks ago, and let me tell you, it's going right in the garbage. I really wish I had known about this problem before I went ahead and wasted my time and money on it. I just hope that it doesn't take long for me to get back on track and start ovulating again. How long has it taken everyone else to be ""normal"" again??"
1,Do not recommend,We have been trying to conceive for one year now. Over the summer I bought FertilAid after reading all of the positive reviews. I have always had an irregular cycle. I started taking FertilAid in hopes that I would have a more regular cycle and I had just the opposite happen. After taking the FertilAid for 3 months I still had no signs of AF. After one more month I went to the OB/GYN who recommended I go to a RE and then prescribed me Provera to induce my AF. FertilAid did nothing for my cycle and actually made it worse (which I didn't think was possible). Don't waste your money or time on this product.
5,"Ladies! Trust me, it works!!!","If you're skeptical, keep reading!I'm 23 years old, married, and ttc. I've always had irregular periods, excessive bleeding for long periods of time, and periods that went MIA for over a year or two. After years of period trouble, I went on the pill before I got married (big mistake, especially for someone with my menstrual history), went off a year later, didn't have a period for two months, then got one suddenly. After that period-nothing. Still no sign of a period six months later. I heard about Fertilaid and thought, for the price, it couldn't hurt either way. After less than two months of taking it (i'm about to start my third consecutive month of fertilaid), my period returned, my first ever NORMAL period. Only five days, as opposed to my 11 to 12 day, heavy, helter skelter few and far between periods I'd had in the past. This really works if you have a history of irregular cycles or periods. Try it. You'll be amazed! I was and still am!"
1,Crushed Hopes!!,"I am a huge review reader. If I dont like the reviews, I dont buy. I took a chance on this and bought the male & female pack. My husband and I have been trying for a year and I thought before we started expensive treatments, that I would try this first. I took it for a month. The only thing it gave me was acne, a jacked up cycle and 10 extra pounds on my ass! Do you know how it feels to be 8 days late when you're trying to have a baby only to get your period on that 8th day? Let me tell you...IT SUCKS!!! I have NEVER been late. I am always 28 days to the day. Now, my second month of not taking these stupid pills, I am going on 2 weeks late and I know I'm not pregnant because I already took a test. Which, obiviously, was negative.So thanks a lot Fertilaid for the awesome weight gain and acne NOT associated with pregnancy...just your crapy pills!"
5,works,Packaging was great...arrived on time...and works... :-)...after the third month my wife got pregnant...I'm so happy...she's 6 1/2 weeks...now can't wait to know what we are having
1,Stopped me from ovulating!,"After trying to get pregnant for 5 months (my first child took 2) I got impatient and decided to give Fertilaid a try. I had completely normal cycles before and was ovulating every month ( I have the Clear Blue Easy Ovulation monitor). Three months into using fertilaid and although my cycle is about the same, I haven't ovulated in 2 months! I should have believed the people who said that if your cycles were normal that you shoudln't use it. I am so bummed about the time and money that I have wasted on this!"
3,Okay i guess,First time i tried this product i got my period back for 6 months now it disappeared and i tried this product again this time around nothing! id recommend seeing a doctor for fertility help
1,I should've listened to the negative reviews!!,"I've read reviews that said you should not take this product if you are regular. I should have listened! I didnt even make it through a full bottle of this, before I had to stop using it! And that is after avid research on the product. I don't believe that it doesn't work for some, but it is definitey not for me! I started spotting really bad after week 2. I was regular, every 29 days I came on, but this made me irregular. Im going to see if my body regulates itself and I might try clomid at the end of the year."
2,"May be to soon to tell, but...","I am 32 and was diagnosed with hypothalamic amenorrhea 4 1/2 years ago. I bought this product after all the glowing reviews and have been using it faithfully for 1 month. I know it may be too early, but I haven't noticed any changes in my body yet, nor have I had a menstrual cycle."
1,Would give this 0 stars if I could,"I too am like some of the other reviewers who were regular before taking this product. If you are regular, PLEASE re-consider before purchasing. I have been taking Fertilaid for about 2 and a half months now and stopped taking it two weeks ago after reading all of the other negative reviews. Today my doctor confirmed that I did not ovulate this month, and I truly feel that this is due to the Fertilaid. I am hopeful that my cycle will return to normal very soon. Good luck to all of you on the TTC journey!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Save your money! This product isn't all that its cracked up to be - even thought we'd really like it to be! I'd say that it must help if you have irregular cycles, but if you have regular cycles, like I do, it may not be a good product for you. When I took it last month I didn't even ovulate at all - before I took it I did like clockwork, and then after I took it, I didn't ovulate that month......coincidence!?!?!!?"
5,Worked for me!,My husband and I were TTC for 7 months and when I took this for a month I got pregnant! Worth a shot!
4,WE SHALL WAIT AND SEE ...(fingers crossed),"MY husband and i have been trying to conceive for years now with NO luck, My period is all out of whack. I wanted to be put on Clomid but my Doctor told me that i should wait. But My husband and I want a baby ASAP. We just ordered fertilAid ..so I guess we shall see what happens. I was also told by my Doctor that I dont Ovulate...so Im going by stories on here that it can work. I really hope this works for me. I shall keep you all posted. Thanks for reading.-USMC Wife"
4,TTC,"I have been ttc for over a year. My periods are somewhat normal, but I do not ovulate regularly. I have read so many wonderful reviews about Fertilitea, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the tea last week and just received it Friday. I started taking the tea on last Saturday. I drink 3 cups a day. Hopefully, soon I will have great news to share with you all."
1,Regular? Do not buy this product!!,"If you have regular periods, do NOT buy this product. I am 34 and have been trying to conceive for 4 months. I have had regular periods and have been ovulating since I stopped taking birth control. I saw the advertisement with the hopes of conceiving quickly and I thought, every little bit helps. Since taking this product for 5 weeks, I have NOT ovulated. I have stopped taking it and hoping for the best next month."
1,A waste of time and money...,"This book has nothing to do with Jennifer Aniston really. Her self-absorbed neurotic mother is simply making a sad attempt to capitalize on her fame. And if that werent bad enough, it's BORING, shallow, poorly written, and completely transparent. The time I spent foolishly reading this book is regretfully several hours of my life I can never get back. Don't bother."
5,From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir,"Nancy Aniston is a very bitter woman. Her memoir is written with such condescension about her family and friends that one wonders if her psycho bable camaflages her self centered personality. It is clear she is jealous of her daughter's celebrity status and wants the world to know how responsible she was for Jennifers talent, only to be rejecterd by Jennifer in favor of hangers on and Jonnie come- late-lies. (lies?, that's interesting how that spilled out.)) The memoir is revenge against Jenifer, and is ugly and in bad taste."
1,Ugh...this book is nauseating.,Nancy Aniston is a melodramatic whiner who is trying to cash in on her daughter's fame - plain and simple. She is emotionally unstable and a textbook manipulator. I think Jennifer Aniston is better off without her mother. Sometimes we have to rid our lives of toxic influences...even if that toxic influence is our mother.
1,avid reader,"I think abreedlove pretty much summed up my feelings on this book. Nancy Aniston is a vain woman who seems to feel like the world revolves around only her. After reading the book, it just makes me feel more sorry for Jennifer that she had a mother like that."
4,Surviving childhood trauma and adult challenges with grace.,"I'm not an avid reader but each chapter in this biography kept my interest. It opened my mind to the major improvemenrs in the availability of help for families living with overwhelming difficulties. There's a thread of hope, understanding and acceptance that runs through the book as the author describes the various circumstances that resulted in five unexpected separations from different family members. It also gave me a view of a normal family with high aspirations and working in the entertainment world. I felt sad at times and chuckled at other times while reading this book. The experiences she shared about raising her son and daughter as a single mom were quite wonderful. It is clearly a ""morally uplifting."" book and should appeal to all age readers."
3,"an overpaid tv star, who must believe her own publicity","I just finished this book, and I can't believe the reviews I've seen here. Did I read the same book as the rest of you? It seemed to me to be a thoughtful, sincere effort to understand the sad estrangement from her only daughter. One television interview warrants 8YEARS OF SILENCE? Give me a break!!! While the actors on Friends are certainly talented, no one deserves that kind of money! Her mother did without all those years, supported her, emotionally and otherwise, and this is how she is treated? I don't think the mother is self-centered, egotistical or borderline, at all. It sounds to me more like you're describing her daughter. I'm a firm believer of ""Karma"", and I really believe this will come back around to haunt Jennifer. I would give anything to have my wonderful mother here to talk to. I think Nancy Aniston has done a courageous job of ""getting on with her life"". I totally recommend this book. Karol Santiago"
5,Suculent photos married to beautiful erotic text.,"This shimmering collection of nudes,male and female,can be debated to be a perfect gift for your love. Inscribed with your own words and pointing to a page of succulent text and a most erotic body you will surely send the arrow home like Cupid.A woman's breast cast upon with a vine's shadow is not far from the lower torso of what's surely a male dancer, toe pointing on a small wooden ball.A jug of wine , a loaf of bread and this.Review this beautiful book of nudes together by a roaring fire."
5,An exploration of bodies alone and bodies together,"These photos are always thoughtful, always tasteful, often challenging. They were taken by people curious about those curves of men's and women's bodies that beckon your hands to touch and trace. Unlike some collections of nude photographs, Eros is not afraid of men's bodies. They are depicted with the same care and curiosity and hunger as the women's."
5,beautiful collection,"This has to be the best collection of nude/erotic photography and poetry ever compiled. I highly, highly recommend this for anyone, no matter what their interests are."
1,Terrible.,"If you are looking at getting into working with tin, this is NOT the book for you! This book should be used for grade school art classes at best. If you are like me, I wanted something to help me learn to work with tin. I am making an old fashion pie safe and I needed something to sharpen my skills. This is not the book for that."
5,A must for Aerospace Students or Engineers.,"Even if the book is old, it's the base of the airfoil understanding, because of the data included. Don't look for strange things here, just the classic stuff, but very complete."
5,Great Book,"I'm an aerospace student and bought this book for some complementary reading. I found it useful and informative. The airfoil section is a little dated and more modern airfoils are often better performers for certain applications but it is a good resource for NACA airfoils. Its great for becoming more familiar with drag polars and the effects that tripping the flow, high-lift devices, camber, thickness, etc all have on performance."
2,Great reference text but definitely not for the beginner,"This is a somewhat advanced reference text on wing aerodynamics and is definitely not for the beginner. It assumes the reader has a considerable knowledge of mathematics, including a great deal of calculus. On the other hand, if one can filter out some of the dry math and retain the important concepts, this is a book well worth having in your library."
2,"Great Reference, but be careful who you order from","The text itself is great, however, I ordered a new copy, but received a very obviously used one. Dog-ears on pages, corners worn. Would not qualify as ""very good"" let alone ""new""."
3,Useful refernce,"A bit outdated in today's data world, but a must as reference.Could be updated/supplememnted with MathCad or MathLab routines"
4,"Difficult, but complete","I bought this book mostly as a reference. As such, I have not worked through much of it. Mathematically, the authors hold nothing back from the theory of fluid dynamics--as such, it's not an easy book to work through, but doable with patience. But, it certainly appears to all be there, if/when you may need it."
3,Lacking ... I'll explain,"Not to be too hypocritical, but young man in a strange country, falls in love with a young girl living in despair and needing help. They both need each other, very unoriginal plot, but I liked it altogether because of the information given. I've never thought more about Venice than that it was a tourist attraction and I learned a lot. I also now want to learn the language which seems like a lot of fun!"
5,"Excellence, in a word!","This book opens your esyes to the beautiful city of Venice, the characters are very original, as well as the story. The setting captures you in a way which makes you feel atached to it. A story for all ages. Don't miss out on this incredible book."
5,"Interesting, Historical, Summer Romance","Dear Looking For A Good Book To Read, You have found it. This wonderfully written book is a twist of: romance between an American tourist (Percy) and a politically radical Venetian girl (Graziella) & Venetian politics when a group of politically radical teens try to stop the government of Venice from having the Expo in their city. IF YOU BUY ONE BOOK IT SHOULD BE THIS ONE!!!"
1,ITALINO,"I am a huge fan of Donna Jo Napoli's books. She's very talented and I love everyone of her young adult books-except this one.Not to be rude, but it was boring. I was hardly interested in it, but I decided to give it a try. When there was only just 30 pages left, I gave up on it. I flipped through to see them talking about how they love eachother. It was very strange.The story was boring and went on for too long on pretty much nothing. It just wasn't my thing. I just couldn't get into it. But perhaps you may like this book. It's your opinion.I love Donna Jo Napoli, especially Sirena, Song of the Magdelan, Beast and The Magic Circle. She is a really good author."
2,Not a bad book,"but not a great one either.Set in a mythical renaissance kingdom in Central Europe, WHEN THE KING COMES home tells the story of Hail Rosmer, art student with a fascination for a long-dead artist/alchemist. When the alchemist's seal is used to return long-vanished King Julian, Hail is drafted to protect the kingdom from the necromancer.It's an interesting premise and Stevermer's world is interesting enough as well. I found it hard to get into the characters, however. Hail's fascination for Maspero drives the novel, but isn't really explained. Partly because the story is told from Hail's first person point of view, the other characters blend in together without strong differentiation.WHEN THE KING COMES HOME is a pleasant read--but it has hints that it could be so much more."
1,BORING !,"After having read many fantasy books by many different authors I must say that this book was the worst of all !Even though the style is ok, the plot is as interesting as watching a stone fall to dust...At first I thought it might improve and kept on reading up to page 184 (of 236) but then just couldn't stand it anymore and stoped.The story is very constructed, the surrounding world doesn't feel real, everything appears very static and the characters are lifeless puppets. Not even once did I have the feeling of being part of the story, instead I always forced to myself to keep on reading in hope for an improvement ...which never came, up to that point where I simply gave up, and I'm not the kinda guy who gives up easily on a book.I can't recommend this book at all."
4,If only the King came Home more often!,"Caroline Stevermer is one of those authors who writes (it seems) a book a decade, but oh what a book, when it finally appears! _When the King Comes Home_ is a true treasure -- realistic fantasy that doesn't shy away from showing all of the trials and tribulations that we often forget when indulging in a fantasy. The narrator is a young girl, apprenticed to an artist in the capital city of her (imaginary) country, who ends up being witness and participant in the changes that come when the Good King Julian of legend (he lived several hundred years ago, and died while at war, in Europe) reappears. There is a subtle Arthurian twist to the tale, which makes the characterization of the King's Seraph and his Queen, who also are brought back by necromantic means, richer and deeper.This is a book which rewards reading and re-reading. Another classic by Stevermer."
2,try something else of hers,"There's no doubt Stevermer can write some eloquent prose, however, her ability to keep a story interesting falters in several places in this book. It took a short while for me to get into the book and start liking it, and it was a good story for half, until she threw in her major plot twist which I feel disrupted a more interesting story. By the last few chapters I was speed reading just to find out how it finished. I have hopes that her style might yet yield a better book from her, but I don't think I'll try another Stevermer."
3,Fetish not Femdom,"One would expect (from it's title & description) a photographic journal of female dominance, but this is not what's found in this book.Granted, the photography in this book is wonderful, but the title is deceiving to it's content. If you're looking for staged: female dominant / female submissive latex fetish photography (primarily lesbian) then this is definitely your book. But if you're looking for images portraying real life female domination in a series of female/male relationships then you should definitely look elsewhere."
2,Not a very good purchase,"Our child is a very active child. Likes to dance to music and loves Barney - so we thought this would be a perfect gift. Boy, were we wrong!The Barney doll continually falls off of the base that it stands on; the base, once put on, cannot be taken off. The instructions even caution the purchaser to make sure they get it right the first time!Overall, the toy is not very educational. Aside from the toy asking our child to find a different colored foot print, or one of Barney's pals on the mat, there is not much more the toy will teach."
4,Better than some are saying,I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son for Christmas. At first I didn't want to buy it because a lot of the reviews said that the Barney fell over and wouldn't stay on his little stand. I figured my son loves Barney so worst comes to worse he would hold barney and dance. It worked just fine. I blew him up and at first he looked a little limp but I just opened him up and really blew him up and capped the plug as fast as I could. That worked like a charm. Every day or two I have to blow hime up again. Not a big deal. The reward of seeing my son dancing and smiling is worth it.
2,Don't waste your money,This toy is defintly not worth the money. You will spend more time blowing it up than your kids will enjoy playing with it. Even when it fully blown up it still falls over. It was not at all what I expected it to be esp for the price.
2,not fun,I guess this toy would be ok-if you just want the dancemat. We got this toy as a gift and have used it twice. The problem-Barney does not stay up and constantly tips over. We've tried to fix him but still doesn't work-now we're going to toss it.
4,Party with Barney,"We did not have any problems with this toy such as Barney falling over (just inflate him more to help him stand erect) and pulled it out for the first time at my daughter's 2 year old birthday party. Her little friends were all intrigued with it and it kept them busy for a long time without any fights. The mat could be ripped up by rough handling, but it is quite durable and lots of dance fun."
4,Great toy for a two year old who likes to dance!,My 18 mnth old loves this toy. She loves to dance with him even though she can't understand the steps yet. She especially loves to pick Barney up and run off with him! It's one of her favorite toys and my 6 mos old laughs when he hears Barney talk. He thinks it's really cool that Barney is in our house. (:
4,Disappointed but satisfied,"My husband and I bought the Move 'n Groove Mat for our almost 2 year old daughter for Christmas and she enjoys it very much!!!! Even though I think the quality of the product is to be desired (the Barney figure come off the base very easy and deflates easily and the mat can become damaged by a family pet like a cat or dog) and not worth the recommended selling price, I think that if you have a child that is a Barney fanatic and loves to dance like our daughter, then this is a decent product."
3,Do not recommend,"I got this toy for my 2 year old since she thinks she is a pop star. I thought she would enjoy making Barney dance. I was not impressed with this toy. At first the toy excited her. But, Barney WILL NOT stay standing up even though I am constantly refilling him. I finally took Barney off and let her dance alone. (Now she just uses him as a doll). I am not even impressed with the dance mat. The inside seems to be sliding around, so she when she steps on the pictures with her little foot, often nothing happens. Also, Barney's speech is slightly muffeled and hard for a two year old to understand ."
4,"Fun, but clumsy","My 21 month old son loves this dance mat, but gets upset when Barney falls over. I've read other reviews, and can see that it is not that ours is defective, but the toy was poorly designed. Fix the falling over problem, and you've got yourself a great toy!"
1,Limbo Barney???,"I should have read these reviews before I got this item for my daughter, it was a total disappointment. Barney does not hold enough air to stay standing up so even though you can orginally start him standing his foot stays in as his body spins around as if he is doing the limbo. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!"
2,Too lound. not enough educational value,"Could not wait to get this for my 2 year old grandson as the concept seemed really great. It is way too loud. Semi-classical could have been used instead of whatever the programmed music is called.Hard to hear the mat music, noise, because of the music.Barney was hard to blow up as the air kept coming out of the blow up hole.We are taking this toy back."
1,"Barney Dance Mat, not so Super Duper",The Barney doll is a blow-up doll and does not stand up properly on the stand even when it is at filled at capacity with air. It just turned out to be a big noise-making mat that our toddler dances on.
4,Cute,This really teaches and is a lot of fun but my daughter doesn't play with it much. Barney detaches which is great because my daughter loves to carry him around.
2,NOT a 2008 revision; Know what you are getting.,"It's easy to think this book is a copyright 2008 rewrite to ""The Hive and the Honeybee"", last revised by the Dadant company in 1992. It is not. Instead this is merely a reprinting of the 1946(!) edition. There are no updates. The 1992 version is the most recent one out there. At $47 I was a tad disappointed--the 1992 revision is sold by Dadant for $36 in hardcover.I might keep the book as a historical library addition, but the original 1853 edition is available for free on pdf at gutenberg.org. I have seen the 1992 edition and if you're looking for a more useful reference, that is the one to get. I plan to."
2,Won't work in car,"I love the CD, but it sounds terrible if I play it in my car. It sounds fine if I play it on the computer though. I was pretty disappointed, but the price was good."
2,"Practical philosophy, anyone?","The idea is great: philosophers ought to get out of the ivory tower and talk to the genera public, in this case by setting up counseling practices to complement the various types of psychotherapy already available. Marinoff does not suggest that philosophers replace psychologists or, as the title of his most popular book claims, that Plato can replace Prozac. What he does say, however, is that philosophy ought to be mined by people interested in figuring out how to live their lives in a more balanced and ethical way. Unfortunately, the book is not as good as it may have been, due to Marinoff's trademark abrasive style, which takes the form of unnecessary (and very long) rants against other professions and the very same academia from which Marinoff receives a stable job and good benefits. Talk about not biting the hands that feeds you."
5,Marvellous !,"Words are not enough to describe Lenny Breau and what he did for the guitar ! You just have to hear for yourself, even in his younger days he was the best. So sad he didn't live longer."
4,And outsider in his native land,"This novel of displacement really begins when teenager Beltran Soler returns for a vacation to Chile, the land of his birth - and it turns into a permanent relocation. He finds himself an outsider among his native people just as he's about to take the giant step into puberty.And so he grows up and becomes a seismologist, believing he can protect himself from life's shaky foundations by immersing himself in the theories of tectonic plates. Then his grandfather dies in an earthquake and Soler holes up in an LA hotel and sort of comes unglued. He obsessively lists the movies of his life in an attempt to extinguish the firestorm of nostalgic that threatens to overwhelm him.The Movies of My Life is a sly and humorous coming-of-age novel that is far deeper than it appears to be on the surface. It deals with the immigrant experience, culture shock, family connections, and contemporary family dysfunction.It's a good one."
3,Just OK.,"All the best pro-hormones have now been banned. I used Mass FX for a few cycles, and the results were good. However, I feel like these only produced a pleceebo effect. Find a Canadian site to send you some superdrol or hemobolin."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"One for the bridge fans.A wealthy eccentric invites a group of crime solvers to a function, and tells them he also has a group of murderers in attendance. What else would you do with these groups but play cards? If you don't know anything about bridge this may intrigue you, or completely bore you with the card playing details. Very silly setup of course, but entertaining enough for that, as Poirot tries to work it all out when, as will surprise nobody, one of the attendees carks it."
2,Not the best Agatha Christie Book,"If you don't play, understand, or enjoy bridge (the card game), it may be difficult for you to be completely immersed in this book. This was, by far, not one of my top 10 Agatha Christie books. I recommend Sleeping Murder, which I read right before Cards on the Table."
5,Poirot always a winner,"I give all Poirot mysteries 5 stars because of their entertainment value. Like a finely crafted antique, they each have a charm of their own. Taken together, the copious production by Christie is a gift to the readers of mysteries."
5,Really Enjoyed Book,This was delivered to my Kindle with no difficulty. The book itself was great! It contains twists that the reader might not be expecting.
3,Good,"The book was good, but it is not my favorit Agatha Christie book. It's a kind of funny book, and you'll never guess who the murder is. When I read it I kept on saying ""Oh.... Now I know who the murder is!"" But I was always wrong. (I want to get in contact with other Agatha Christie fans. I am a 12 yeard old girl from Norway.)"
5,"A brilliant muder mystery, with evedince against everyone!","Think of it- four suspects, all with an equal oppertunity and motive to have killed the mysterious Mr.Shaitana. At several points, it seems as though you know exactly who has done it- until you find out that it was not them, but another suspect. A brilliant, though sometimes confusing plot, all come into focus by the charming personality of Hercule Poirot."
4,Books,Cards on the Table: A hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries) book arrived on time and in excellent condition. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading mysteries.
3,OK BUT....,Not as good as I thought it would be. acting was not up to standards...rather poor..I was loseing interest as I listened..I would have rather read the book
1,Horrible!,I was so excited to get this because it is diffcult to make a cake completely level. I thought it would make it easier. It didn't. The handle is too small which makes it hard to get any sort of force behind the lame wire that is supposed to cut cake. It simply rubs up against the edge of the cake and makes more of a crumbly mess that cut anything. A waste of money. This went into the trash after 5 minutes.
2,Not worth the cash,"I bought the wilton brand cutter, and like other reviewers, had similar experiences.1. The wire often doesn't cut into the cake round , and I often have to start it with a knife cut.2. The wire does flex, which means you don't get a good, stable cut. I've often had to go right behind and re-level the cake after a pass with the wire cutter.3. If there's any crusting on the side edges of the cake, it will tear out whole chunks as the wire passes through it. Even when you hold your hand over the sides to keep it from doing major damage, it still tears and crumbs.I'm of the opinion of others here who've stated they've returned to their knives, which do a much better job. The cake leveler might work better if you're cutting into a hot cake, but it surely doesn't work on a cooled down one. Skip this and all similar products and instead invest in a good knife."
3,so so,I wanted this product because I thought that it would help me slicing my cake easily with a good cut. Well maybe I was wrong.I've been using it for months. Most of the cakes I made were sponge cake. I need a very sharp tool for a fine cut but this tool seems not sharp enought for a sponge cake.This product may work fine with a dense cake like butter cake but it's just ok for a sponge cake. It's not that bad but it's wasn't good as I expected.
2,Disappointed,"The wire simply refuses to stay taught in the small grooves especially as you move it higher. I used it twice, ruined 2 cakes and never used it again. I didn't give it 1 star as part of the problem could be me, not the tool but there is no doubt this is simply designed poorly"
4,"Quick, easy and effective....","Gilad never disappoints. His enthusiasm, good looks and effective routines always make a difference in a short period of time. I have been following him ever since I first saw him on the Discovery Channel."
2,Should have rented first and saved money,"His workout video Interval Training is one of my favorite workouts, I use it 3 times a week and don't grow tired of it...so when this came out I was excited to get it. Disappointment ensued. I tried it twice and likely won't put it in again. The background women look identical like they are out of a Simply Irresistible 80's video, dressed alike, no individual personalities. They keep making funny faces and are distracting.I didn't like the format of the videos either. Warm up and Cool down are on one disk and cardio on another. So you have to pop video one in, warm up, video 2 in workout, video one back in to do cool down."
4,Very good workout DVD,I have a lot of workout DVD's by Gilad and this is one of my favorites. Very good series.
3,"Great for exercise, and that's it.","Cons:The songs are not good.There is no sense of progression through the game, you just pick a song and dance. They give you a score at the end. You can unlock songs by scoring high enough on other songs.Pros:It can be good, fun exercise."
5,The Best!,"This game is the best. You can do anything. The only thing it lacks is the fact all the popular songs are gone (Konami had liscencing problems). Hey but you still get all those other good songs even ones that weren't in the Japaneese version. And quit complaining about the song divisions you can turn them off (you people need to check the ""options"" menu every once in a while). There's also better graphics than the original. You can also create your own dance steps for certain songs. And there is a six button mode where you'll also use the X and O buttons. Hey, GET THIS GAME!"
2,Hmmm...,"I heard Konamix was better than MAX, but bought MAX anyway. I am a very good DDR player, I can handle most 8 footers (thats pretty hard, for those who don't play or aren't that good). I play mostly MAX on PS2 and 5th- 8th mix at the arcade (8th Mix is Extreme). Compared to these, I was disappointed with Konamix. The songlist, save for Burnin' the Floor, Matsuri Japan, Afronova, Afronova Primeval, and B4U, was pathetic, IMO. Plus, I noticed a 1/4 second lag between myself hitting the arrow and the game registering it. Could be that the disc was scratched. Is it supposed to do that? Someone, tell me in a review.Get MAX, or wait till September 26 and get MAX2. Trust me, its better than this one."
1,Ick!,This game was not very good. The songs are basically the same as the first one and game play is very hard.
2,Not good at all.......,"I do not recommend this game. If you are thinking of buying this game because of some good reviews you might have seen, DONT. The songs are horrible! None of the good songs from the arcade versions are in this game. And it claims to have 50 songs but it feels more like 15, good luck finding 50. Anyway, I would wait until a decent ddr comes out in the US or if your a disney fan go for the Disney mix, that seems to be the best so far."
4,A full fledged hooked on game,"This game Rocks! For ps it has great graphics. And as an owner of the whole set of DDR games, you should listen. I like Yuni and Emi personally. Take my advice, get the game.If only I had a memory card for ps."
5,A must read,"This book is a must read for anyone working with Chicano/Chicana students in schools. Prof. Pizarro's insights come from real experience ""in the field,"" and his analysis is one that you'll want to consider."
3,La-la-la--Ooo-ooo and ghostly overtones....,"This is an `okay' soundtrack, more suitable for music to nap by.I think most Lisa Gerrard fans will be somewhat disappointed--you really don't hear any lyrics or get to grasp the extent of her beautiful voice....I purchased this cd with with high hopes of a much awaited for Lisa Gerrard release.... instead I got a `very pretty ghost story soundtrack'.Sorry Lisa, I have loved you since ~Dead Can Dance~ but this oneis a let down...."
4,"Not for Lisa Gerrard fans, but it's still good","Those looking for another Lisa Gerrard album won't find it here, but this soundtrack is still good. On a good sound system it's very clear and spacious. Great to turn the lights out at night and turn it up fairly loud."
2,"Amazing movie, just OK soundtrack","The movie is wonderful. Rich, thoughtfully acted and respectful of the New Zealand Maori culture. However, the soundtrack is not that special. Just new age-y background music and not that memorable. It has been suggested by others that Gerrard did better work with Dead Can Dance. I agree. Still, the movie is remarkable and worth seeing."
5,Outstanding work.,"Outstanding work, but its mostly good for background music. You can tell by listening how this would apply well to an underwater world. =)Great job Lisa!"
3,okay,"can't hear the movie dialogue so not sure why the included it. Other than that annoying fact, it is a good soundtrack."
3,Whale Rider Cd,We saw the film and liked the music and have enjoyed the CD very much. Great service and delivery.
2,Whale rider - original score? - I'm not so sure.,"I recently rented the movie Whale Rider, and shortly into it became aware that the main atmospheric motif, (a kind of ambient piano riff) was in fact lifted hook line and sinker from track four of an album entitled 'Waiting for Cousteau' that was released in 1990 by Jean Michel Jarre.The instrumentation, production and melody are identical, and unsurprisingly the interview with Lisa Gerrard on the DVD failed to include any reference to the earlier recording as an influence.The other tracks on the Whale Rider CD/DVD bear no such resemblance and are nice evocative pieces of the subject of the movie. It's a nice easy listen, but any owners of Waiting for Cousteau out there might lift their eyebrows a little when the main theme comes over the stereo....."
5,Please think first!,"Well, some people say where is Lisa's voice, but I don't care. I know that her voice is more than wonderful but listen this beauty, peace work and when I read that: "" this is a stupid soundtrack"" like somebody said... made me feel really bad because the people don't think in the possibilities on the music world, so if you want to listen a common and emotional normal score go to the store and buy the ""Tita..."" you know what soundtrack? No bad at all but normal the same pattern.Please do you know what is the whole point in that movie?,please think in the possibilities and If you don't like this music please listen first the score in someplace or read the reviews... make me that favor before write a review... we are talking about the sea, the whales ""HELLO?"", Don't you see the name "" Whale Rider"" What are you waiting for? A wagnerian type of music, classical music, The Host Of Seraphim!I know that is beautiful music but please THINK. Don't be fool think before!"
5,Whale of an album,"I stumbled upon this movie ""The Whale Rider"" one fetid afternoon on PBS TV. It is a powerful movie that moves you. At least it did me. A movie such as this comes along but rarely. Tears welled up in my eyes towards the end. The music is just as stirring. The old Maori chants are so similar to the chants of some tribes in India. A lost world now gone from us. I am glad someone made a movie on this theme. That it acquired such a haunting soundtack contributes to its universal success. I highly recommend the movie and the CD, in that order."
4,"Future's so BRIGHT, you'll need shades...","Pros:Easy to assemble, use, and maintain... Portable and bright...Cons:Item gets extremely hot... Be extremely careful around children and animalsRecommendations:Better labeling for EXTREME HEAT..."
5,Great Gift!,"Hubby was so excited with this item as his gift! He was amazed at how bright the bulbs were. Said ""we can light up the entire back yard""! So glad he was happy as I find him hard to please."
5,So far so good,"Gets very hot as do all these types of lights but it works very well, puts out a huge amount of light, is sturdy and sits securely on the floor. Great purchase."
3,overpriced,"Not a bad work light. I suppose the wider angle illumination is a plus, but for about half the cost of this light I could have gotten one from Home Depot. This light gets very hot. The grill that protects the whole apparatus is sturdy, but be warne that also heats up pretty quick."
2,Poor AM reception,"I'll admit, this radio looks neat, has decent sound for its size, and the FM reception is good. However, I could pull in virtually no AM stations without physically touching the antenna, and the stations I did get were not as clear as expected. In the photos of this product, the tuning knobs appear to be metallic, they are not. for $100, I expected better."
2,"OK radio for listening to music, way too much bass for news","I bought this radio at Target for $59.99 (they sell the black color model only). It has a good analog FM tuner and I like the retro look. However, the ""surround sound"" feature actually resulted in a somewhat muffled sound in our kitchen. But my major complaint is that there is way too much bass for listening to news, which is what I do most of the time (NPR) -- and there is no bass adjustment. It is probably a decent radio for listening to music, but for my purposes it was unacceptable. I returned it."
4,Good addition to any Pilates DVD collection,"My first Ana Caban DVD, and after this I look forward to more. The session is not overly long, but you still get worked out, and some interesting moves add variety. Some isometric moves add moderate intensity for some heart rate elevation. Ana's verbal attitude is pleasant & positive. I'm glad to have chosen this DVD."
3,Read the title: MAINTENANCE,I didn't read the title carefully...I am holding on to this DVD until I lose the weight I need.
2,"Pretty, but defective.","I bought this ring along with another smoky quartz ring from the same vendor. This ring fit nicely, but the large stone was chipped, scratched and had numerous bubbles in it. The silver is 'heavy' looking, not delicate. The other ring had to go back because it was simply HUGE, and I didn't want something that big, but it was in excellent condition. It sat a good half an inch above the top of my finger and the stone was as wide. This ring was also big, but not overly so. Neither appeared like good quality rings but then for these prices, you can't really expect top quality."
2,Disappointed in the small stone color.,"I was disappointed in the color of the 6 small garnet stones surrounding the large center stone. The small garnets are very light in color, like a blush. I am having my local jeweler replace them with fire garnets to match the center stone. Had I known of the color variation, I would not have purchased this ring. The photo on the internet does not represent the true color of the garnets."
4,"wonderfully tough, nice gameplay hook.","I enjoyed the xbox demo so much that I had to get the game. Very realistic difficulty, very tactile and rewarding gunplay- especially when you took down a chopper with a single shot- and nice soldier swap hook. In single player if you died the cam would zoom to a character of your choice and you continue the fight. Actually I think you could hot swap at will if the next soldier was in your line of sight. Remembering this is gettin me pumped for the latest BF game."
3,boring,not att al like full spectrum warrior or some of the other better quality games for xbox I still have yet to use it more than once or twice it might grow on me.
2,This eye candy doesnt live up to the hype.,"Battlefield 2: Modern Combat has vast environments and beautiful textures, and with loading times being shorter than expected. But, even purchased as the spinoff console version, I still expected (and hoped) the gameplay to somewhat fall inline with the traditonal 'battlefield' gameplay and mechanics I fell in love with on the PC. I would consider this title for dedicated fans of the modern warfare genre who intend to play this exclusivly on LIVE. If you're looking for a co-op or offline multi-player look elsewhere. Only six more days til star wars battlefront 2. You can wait a little longer, cant you?"
1,No update - no game,This will be a short review as I have been unable to play the game. When loaded the game informs you a update is needed to play the game (usually on the game disk)not it appears with this game; you are instructed to go to the web site and download and burn a disk. When the burn disk is placed in the consol nothing happens as the download is not recognized. So there we have it -- I have not as of yet played the game.
3,EA needs to fix bugs for online play,"I'm sure a lot of people are buying this game to play online. As of the first week of the release, there are so many problems with the online functionality. Problems logging in, ""cannot connect to EA"", horrible horrible lags (for eg. when you're running or driving, every few seconds you get bounced back as if you're running into a trampoline), getting booted out of the server, server disconnect, etc. As you can imagine, it can get quite frustrating playing online. At least EA is fixing this problem at this moment. Luckily, the single player campaign missions are fun to play. The single player game will keep me satisfied until the online function gets more stable."
2,Worst game to buy,This is the shortest game in history and is not worth buyingThis is a definent rental game1.5 stars of 5
2,Single-Handedly Destroys the Tac-Shooter Genre,"BF2:MC single-handedly destroys the tactical-shooter gaming genre.It destroys the concepts of camo, concealment and (in the single-player, where enemy A.I. shoots through small hills) even cover.This one is great fun, if you have a habit of drooling on your controller; otherwise, those who prefer a more tactical experience are better served checking out the hard-to-find and less-expensive Operation Flashpoint: Elite or buying the PC version of Battlefield 2."
4,Battlefield vs Mercenaries,"I have played about 50% of the missions in both games, so here are my comments.These are both fun 'modern day' war games. You can drive jeeps, tanks and fly helicopters in both games.Mercenaries is a third person game (driving and flying is similiar to grand theft auto).Battlefield is first person and plays like Medal of Honor except with drivable tanks and choppers.Battlefield has 20? large missions while Mercenaries has 90? smaller missions.to be continued"
2,Nah,First off they ruined the hole concept that was fun about the battleifield series which is total freedom capturing points and what not. They have that in multiplayer which is all you should buy this game for. It would have been awesome if that option was available in single player but no they had to go and change it to some gay story mode that sucks very badly.
3,"""Diavolo"" cologne-Banderas","This fragrance is a bit too intense for me, but a tiny sprayin the evening seems to be acceptable. Other women might be ableto wear this daytime. Though I love the actor's performances,I'm very disappointed with the name of the fragrance--it's quite evil.Hope another fragrance is offered soon: lighter, less threatening in name."
5,unforgotten voice,"If you were a fans of Bach or baroque music lover, I strong recommand this set to try it. It's worth listenning many times and not hestiate to interrupt.Gilchrist is my first listenning tenor and show great warm voices, work with Kooij to sign cantata BMv190, how beautiful it's perfect.Besides, other cantata BWV83 is another outstanding article, it bring me into bach music world fully, and release my mind free.Come on, please enjoy it together."
3,Stick with the original Savasana,It's not as beautiful and inspiring as the original Savasana. I find myself only listening to the original and not choosing this one.
4,Still providing hours of fun,"Unlike many ""once and done"" games ... this game continues to provide hours of family fun."
2,WARNING: this CD does not feature the complete concert,"This 1988 Nippon Phonogram CD is a one-CD compilation that ONLY includes the following tracks:Intro of the bandBlue N BoogieRound MidnightTour De ForceLover ManTin Tin DeoEverything happens to meNight in TunisiaIf you want the complete concert with all tunes in the correct sequence(including the important ""Blue Monk"", which the band actually played to near end the concert, along with ""Round Midnight""), get the other CD.DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID."
2,So-So,"""Don't Know Why"" is very good, but none of the rest of the songs are memorable, and all blend together. She has a great voice but the material is dull. A big disappointment"
4,A Sober Rickie Lee Jones,"Norah Jones has a beautiful, airy voice. Her voice resonates like the sounds in a smoky night club. When I first heard her, I thought she sounded very much like Rickie Lee Jones, although their choice of music is very different. While Rickie Lee Jones has released many more CDs than Norah Jones, Norah Jones has been able to make fewer mistakes in her choice of music and in her rendition of songs. What also makes this CD enjoyable is that the recording is engineered very well, and the songs have great imaging. My only complaint about this CD is that some of the songs sound too similar."
2,Disappointed and definately not Jazz!,Ms. Jones has a great distinctive voice. But everything else was a big disappointment. Hardly what I expected and heard before the CD came out. Her music is not jazz. I would never compare her in the same category as Diana Krall and Jane Monheit. Not even close!
4,"Grab this, your favourite book and a cup of tea","I'm far from being a Jazz specialist, so I'm not going to try to categorise ""Come away with me"". I hear Jazz/Blues (""Cold cold heart"", ""Turn me on"", ""One flight down"", the title track) and Folk/Country (""Lonestar"", ""Shoot the moon""). Norah Jones has a beautiful voice, natural, often sensual, a little bit smoky but not too much. I loved the arrangements, with a lot of piano, acoustic guitar and a soft rhythmic section. I guess some people will find the album too down tempo but I enjoyed it. Both arrangements and vocals are soothing. In a word, it did click with me.The slightly more upbeat and folk ""Feelin' the same way"" and the mesmerising ""I've got to see you again"" would be my favourite picks, but I never skip a track. I would consider purchasing her next recording. If you like Cassandra Wilson, give Norah a try."
5,"Mature, eloquent, moving","I suppose like all musical aesthetic evaluations, what your ear is used to and what your expectations are influence how your ear greets a new musical offering. I personally find that so much popular music is formulaic and overwrought; barely pubescent young girls in jarring provocative garb with artificial and unconvincing emotional musical renderings. Norah Jone's first CD is a breath of fresh air. With delicate and sensitive nuance she draws you in and speaks to you in her gentle honey silk voice. She is authentic and unpretentious. What a welcome change from the ear shattering, soul numbing musical lies that seem to be standard fare these days.I find many of the reviews harsh and the comparisons to other artists unfair. If you are looking for adrenaline, look elsewhere. If you want soothing and intimate then this is a CD that you will truly enjoy and come back to often. Thank you Norah."
5,a wonderful new voice!,This is an excellent album well tempered and full through and through. After several plays I still feel compelled to kick back and take another stroll through the meanderings of her piano and wonderful voice. Check out first sessions. Can't wait to see jones PA
4,Such a sultry voice,"I love Norah Jones. This cd is my go to, it's in my car and on my ipod. I take her everywhere. Fun and flirty music."
2,Poor Example of SACD,"My rating of 2 stars applies to the SACD version of this record and not the CD. I consider the CD to be a 5 star recording. After carefully listening to both the two channel SACD mix and the CD stereo versions I could not discern an audible difference. I enjoyed the 5.1 mix and found the rear surround to be tasteful and subtle, not at all distracting, but, again, no significant improvement in detail except that created by spreading the sound around to five channels. A recent article on the ""Stereophile"" website suggests that the SACD mix in fact shares the same 16 bit lineage as the CD, which would explain why the two channel mix and the CD mix sound identical. Norah's label has cheated its customers with this one and should go back and do an actual DSD mix and replace these ""CDs"" for free or give us our money back. There is no reason to purchase this SACD in addition to or in lieu of the CD unless you are interested in listening to a standard resolution 5.1 mix."
4,"Looks and legacy aside, Norah Jones has talent","So what if she's ""hot""... so what if she's Ravi Shankar's girl....Norah Jones is a talent to be reckoned with, and her debut release is worth the praise it has received. Her sultry and hypnotic voice lends itself nicely to some very moody, bluesy tunes. I'm listening right now - for the first time - and I can tell this one's a keeper.Don't be fooled by the nay-sayers. Check it out. You won't be let down."
3,good cd...not enough jesse harris.,"norah's voice and timbre are truly beautiful on this recording. the honest expression of maturity is astounding for such a young musician. and her writing (although sparse) speaks beyond her years. the only thing that i take serious issue with is the absense of jesse harris on some of the tracks. everyone that owns this record should go buy his album 'crooked lines'. right now. jesse provides much of the soul in this band, not to mention the most exceptional writing, and without him the album suffers. so, please do the right thing...don't sleep on jesse harris."
4,This Is NOT JAZZ!!!!,but I do like Norah Jones :) Why does everybody place her in the jazz genre - this is not jazz music. certaibly jazz influenced but still clearly not jazz....ok whateverNorah Jones sounds great - cool voice - sounds like herself. she's cute. certainly worth a purchase
1,sleepy,"she's nice, pleasant but I honestly don't get what all the fuss is about...she had one good song....."
3,"She's good, No Doubt","Norah Jones has a wonderful voice. I bought the CD for her signiture song ""I don't know why"", it's a great piece. However, after listening to the album I found that she imitates in great detail Phoebe Snow. Ever listened to Phoebe? Phoebe is GREAT jazz listening AND she varies her songs enough that there are even some that make you want to get up and dance to. Another talent that Norah seems to be imitating is Sade. Sleeping songs that all run together. I think in time Norah is going to have a great impact on the music world and will make her own mark instead of standing in the shadows of others. In order to do this though she is going to have to develop her OWN sound."
3,COME AWAY WITH THIS!,"This album is magical, although is not all that, as many people stated, this album is simple and does not pretend to be anything but good chillout music, this cd attempt to keep you listening and is not in any way radio friendly, you will have to enjoy the whole album, many songs stand out and many fade in memory, but after all this album is worth it for someone, who's not into jam music!, just good relaxing beats."
3,"Too, too sweet","The music on this album is like its cover: too pretty. I heard her on Charley Hunter's last CD and loved her voice against the funky backdrop. Here, the accompaniment is almost syrupy--and unoriginal. It gets dangerously close to MOR pop, not something you would expect to find on BlueNote. Norah should get with a jazzier, funkier, riskier sound--or risk winning a Grammy and making millions for singing the sugary kind of pap that passes for soul these days."
1,Come Away with Me,"Can she sing? Yes! However, not in the mode of a Billie Holiday or an Anita Baker. This is not Jazz, but Folk. Ms. Jones has no vocal range and little interpretability of the lyrics. Nothing exciting here. Nothing innovative. Nothing plus nothing equals nothing. She is just another pretty face. The ears don't lie -- she is just an average singer with a great promoter. This CD will not stand the test of time. Guarantee!"
1,"Overrated, overhyped","I can't stand how overrated this singer is. It seems that merchandising in music has reached the jazz genre, altough many would argue if this record even qualify as a jazz vocal cd. I am not going to say that Norah Jones is a bad singer, she is better than many prefabricated pop singers, but in no way is she better than contemporary vocal jazz singers like Holly Cole. If you want something new from the regular classics like Fitzgerald or Vaughan you are way better off buying a Holly Cole album. You won't regret it."
1,Puzzled by the Excitment,"I purchased this CD based on reviews that Norah Jones was the next great up and coming female jazz singer, who sang beyond her years. I was in for a huge disappointment! Most of the songs sound like soft country tunes, rather than jazz reditions. Her voice is breathy (trying to sound like Diana Krall), but weak. Most of the arrangements are average at best. If you are looking for a jazz singer try Diana Krall first, then Jane Monheith or Tierney Sutton. Norah needs to go back to school, brush up on technique, and try again."
1,Ughhh...,"I simply don't get how on earth this singer gained so much popularity. With her 'average at best' voice, painfully dull and mediocre arrangements, lyrics that say a whole lot of nothing (most of which she doesn't even write)...what is there to like? And what clown ever classified her as a jazz singer? She's really closer to worn out dive bar singer at remote casino on an Indian reservation somewhere. This is a classic case of alot unwarranted hype heaped on a low talent artist in order to sell albums...what a sham!"
3,Not outstanding but not half bad,"Every new female singer of jazz (or of some jazz) is touted as the best to come along in years. The interesting thing is that most of them are real knockouts ( Monheit, Jones, Krall) but if you really want to hear wonderful renditions of the standards buy some Susannah McCorkle ( a great loss to the music world) or my favorite Anne Hampton Calloway. Both of them know that phrasing matters . While they are all different it is what Billie and Ella knew as well . Jones, Monheit et al are all pretty voices."
5,Too young to be this good,"I was a Norah Jones doubter. I'm 45, a hard-bitten attorney, and a fan of tough-singing people like Elmore James, Hound Dog Taylor, Dorothy Love Coates, Neko Case, and Lavay Smith. (And if you don't know Neko and Lavay: what voices!) I saw the CD, looked at it, couldn't believe that it would be anything more than a light snack. But then I met a bright, lovely woman who convinced me that Ms. Jones is worth a listen--and I listened and was smitten. Ton of bricks. Mack truck. Freight train. She just bowled me over. I have been listening to the CD almost constantly for the past several days, and it keeps getting better. Yes, the stuff is simple, mainly slow-moving--but listen to it for what it is, and I think you'll agree that she's brilliant. That peau-de-soie voice of hers is a treasure. But beyond that, she is obviously one very smart gal whose phrasing improves her material. She's a prodigy. I'm grateful for the tremendous gift of her artistry."
4,Excellent first album.,"Jones has a lovely, sensual voice, excellent pacing, and a strong sense of timing.The songs on the album have a distinct flavor - blues jazz touched with country - that comes off beautifully; my favorite pieces are probably Nightingale and One Flight Down.The major problem with the album is that the songs don't vary enough in tempo and range; a couple good up-tempo pieces requiring extended range would have punched it up and increased the impact of the slower pieces.But an excellent album and an excellent artist."
3,An ok debut album,"These are the only three songs I like from this album: Don't Know Why, Come Away With Me, Turn Me On. Other than that, the rest are just ok."
5,Norah's both professional and beautiful!,"I have to admit I'm a little distracted by her beauty but I sure love hearing her sing! I purchased ""come away with me"" not too long ago and I listen to it quite a bit. She sings realistic songs of love and life,..sometimes a little bittersweet but never depressing. She's both professional and personal which to me is a rare trait. She really is a beautiful person through and through!"
2,Muzak for the Y-generation,"Thin, bland instrumentals with monotonous arrangements that don't seem to accompany Norah Jones so much as just happen to be playing while she's singing. Her voice has an interesting, appealing quality that is not very effectively supported or shown off. The mixing seemed unbalanced with her voice too prominent like she was singing in your ear while the band was playing out on the patio. I think a triple shot espresso might have help her near comatose delivery. Did no one noticed during the recording of this album that a collection of elevator music was being produced? The multi-channel track of the sacd version was horribly mixed. Was everything below 80 hz intentionally left out? I gave this album 2 stars instead of 1 because it is better than Brittany Spears. I've listened several times to see what I missed that maked this Grammy material. I can't figure it out."
2,Learning to Krall,"22? You bet. Real jazz artists take it slow for effect -- think Lady Day playing catch up to the beat or Jimmy Scott stretching meaning and melody until they nearly break. Norah takes everything at a snail's pace because she obviously still needs her training wheels. The voice is nice, but the songs are mostly empty, and the monotony of the mood and pace are deadly. Of course the Eva Cassidy set will eat this up, but fans of real jazz and real romance are advised to move on."
1,Missing the mark with lack of versatility,"Ok... I wrote one of these before, and I guess I want to explain my point.I think this could have been a really good CD if Norah had bothered to stretch her voice a little bit more and pick more exciting or even remotely interesting material. From start to finish, you get the same chords, arrangements, and vocal emotion. Even her upbeat moments are spent dragging her and her listeners down.Having said all that, I can move on to the music. Don't know why is the absolute best track on the CD. In listening to it, you get the gist of the CD from start to finish. However, if you feel the need to listen to something else, Come Away with me is pretty pleasant as well.I cannot in good faith say anything else good about this really BORING disc. How it won the grammys it did will always befuddle me, in much the same fashion as the ALICA KEYS is better than INDIA.ARIE debacle, but that's another issue entire."
1,Horrible,"This is the worst cd I have ever listened to in my whole life. I listened to it after she won mutliple grammy's and was amazed that this cd even won one. She does not write her own lyrics for her songs nor her music. This cd is a complete waste of time and I feel sorry for al souls who beleive this is a good cd. Her voice is absolutely horrendous and the melody in all the songs is pretty much the same, along with her continuous monotone voice. I wasted part of my life by listening to this cd. I feel as though I am a stupider person having listened to her."
1,Armagaddon Come Quickly,"How I ponder the state of the world for it is surely near the end. The time is right for the antichrist to reign. The henchmen of darkness gathered in their gloomy abode chuckle at the ease with which the masses are stoned. To prove their point, one omonous devil reveals a scheme so daring it surely could not succeed. ""My brothers, this will break all the rules, for I can prove humans are complete fools."" ""I have an artist, boring and stail, who I will promote along a golden grammy trail"". As the music plays, the demons howl. ""Surely, our power is great, but people are not so stupid to make this artist's fate"". Alas, they were wrong. The ignorant masses lead like sheep bought into this artist who induces sleep. Yes, it is the twighlight of civilization to be sure. The devil laughs as the aweful jazzy music drones, for they made fools of all who bought into Nora Jones."
3,"Beautiful voice, but. . .","I was blown away when I heard ""Don't know why"" for the first time on the radio. I was even more impressed that they were playing something in the jazz idiom on a pop radio station. I immediately went out and bought the album. To say the least, I was more than a little disappointed with the rest of the album. It certainly wan't because the songs were of poor quality, but after a while they all sounded the same. It's a shame that Norah Jones doesn't try to expand into something a little more up-tempo, or perhaps something with a latin rhythm?"
1,"As Music, NO STARS. As a cure for insomnia, it rates a 5.","I checked out this album from my local public library, and Im glad I did not buy it. This has got to be one of the most boring, slow tempered albums I've ever had the misfortune to listen to. Its HORRIBLE!. Now, Im sure that Ms. Jones is a lovely person, but Im reviewing her album, and it stinks! How this won all those grammys is beyond me. Im a pretty eclectic listener and will give anything a chance, let me save you the trouble, DONT give this a chance. Its the musical equivelant of passing gas."
2,Over-hyped and slick,"Sounds more like warmed over Joni Mitchell or Shawn Colvin than Billie Holiday or Nina Simone. Jazz content is almost nil, despite being on Blue Note. The cover versions are well executed and show some promise, but the originals just aren't very interesting.There's little if no change in tempo and the whole thing kind of runs together into a faceless adult contemporary / folk-pop /Fiona Apple meets Jonatha Brooke meets Jewel kind of drone. Disappointing. And oh yeah...She's probably gonna be HUGE, like Diana Krall!!"
1,Amazing,"Once more, I find it amazing how you put a cute girl behind the microphone, let her breathe in a supposed sexy and sultry voice some superficial words and how massive success comes.Even worse, the music is not pop music, but muzak, and they absurdly call this jazz !"
2,Come away with me,"I saw Norah when she first performed on TV with Willie Nelson and friends, I was floored by her voice and piano talent collectively.It was oddly enough Emmy Lou Harris @ 22, mixed with a touch of Patsy Cline, and a small dose of Bonnie Raitt. Incredible!! Can't wait for the nest CD."
3,"Good CD, but Overrated","This is a well-produced album, and Norah Jones is a decent singer-pianist. But all the acclaim she is getting is somewhat unjustified. Jones' voice is OK, but not great. It has an annoying tone to it, though she does well with ""Cold Cold Heart."" Perhaps I've been spoiled by the recordings of Eva Cassidy and Diana Krall too much, and it may not be fair to compare her to those two. Nevertheless, she doesn't come close to measuring up. Perhaps her voice will become more palatable as she gets older, but for now, it doesn't cut the mustard. For all the promotional clout and recognition this album is getting, I expected better, that's all."
3,"Good Voice, Needs Help","Norah Jones has talent, but. . .On Come Away With Me, the sidemen don't add much. She needs to work with a better group, & that should include a pianoman. There is too much in this album that is (literally and emotionally) in the same key. She needs, in short, a jazz group, with a Tommy Flanagan feeling and a good beat."
3,Do Not Operate Heavy Machinery,"Wow, this CD is really lovely! She has a beautiful voice, the songs are pretty, but really, each and every track is exactly the same. You might consider looking for whatever he hit song is online, downloading it, and listening to it 11 times, because that's just about what the CD is like.Of course, this is NOT to say that I don't like Come Away With Me, because I do, but don't listen to this if you're raring to get somewhere quickly or want to stay awake."
5,Passionate,"Nora Jones will capture the heart of everyone who has ever appreciated natural talent and deep,emotional vocals. Her songs will take you to a place you've always wanted to go in your dreams. ""Come away with me"", the title song, is a journey to the ""mountain top"" that gives you ""the kiss"" of a life time. I am waiting impatiently for her next solo album. She could be the female version of ""John Mayer""...Don't miss this experience....."
5,"Amazing, haunting CD","I was very, very pleasantly surprised by Norah Jones' first effort. The biggest complaint I have with respect to Jazz vocalists is that they often discard melody in favor of virtuosismo (read: it's just to show off their voices). Such is not the case here; all the tracks are beautifully arranged, and provide a melodious presence that translates into distinctive experiences. If you like Dido, Diana Krall, Sarah Brightman, you will probably love this disc."
5,Fabulous Norah!,"I received this as a gift and am very happy with it. I am a fan of jazz and easy listening,and this fits the bill. Its soothing sounds, and relaxing melodies will repeat themselves in your head when the CD is not even on! Her voice is pure magic.Norah Jones does an awesome job with vocals and piano, Lee Alexander is great on Bass, and Adam Levy's electric guitar is just superb!This is 45 minutes of pure enjoyment, and the best part is having it over and over again. With 14 tracks, you really get a fine sample of what this up and coming artist has to offer."
5,"Beautiful Tunes, Disarms Exploding Babies!!!","My baby daughter is a screamer, especially between the hours of 5pm and 8pm or whenever we are trapped on the freeway.I met an amazing lady who is an au-pair that recommended this CD as a baby calmer. She said that none of the rest of Nora's CD's works quite like this one.Let me tell you, it is not a joke. This CD has truly stopped many a melt-down within the last week. If you have a screecher, try this album out, it works, I am not kidding!All of that aside, Nora's voice is just beautiful and the music really is mellow and relaxing. So count me as well as my angry baby as two huge fans, would highly recommend this album!"
5,great music.,"great piece of music, purchased it after listening to it once. Will buy more of her music, glad I heard music and didn't miss out on purchasing it."
4,A Perfect CD to Relax By,"Norah Jones' ""Come Away with Me,"" is an enjoyable, relaxing CD. Ms. Jones owns a very seductive, smokey, and sensual voice. While only 22, she also shows that she has a talent for phrasing a song, and she is clearly a talented performer. She is also very attractive. There's a good selection of jazz, country, and blues songs on this CD. The pacing, or song arrangements, are all pretty similar, which may disappoint some. But in a time when we are bombarded with non-talented, manufactured teenybopper (and older) female singers who screech out every last syllable of a song, it's nice to have a singer like Norah Jones produce this type of music. A very nice debut by a very promising singer."
4,Worth A Look,"I heard the buzz about Norah Jones and finally got my butt in gear to get the CD... This voice is definately worth a listen (or a million). Its a mellow sound that fits just about any occasion. She is not, as I saw one person write somewhere, a ""country sounding"" artist... far from it. Her sound, while based in jazz, dables with folk, pop, and even a bit of Spanish style on my favorite song ""I've Got to See You Again"". Anyone looking for fresh, new sounds that give you a break from the constant droaning of the ""pop elite"" boybands and such, should definately check out Norah Jones. You'll probably like what you hear."
5,Exciting new voice,"To type-cast Nora Jones would be a mistake. She is not just jazz/blues but also a touch of country/folk. The key to this very fine FIRST ALBUM is the distinct phrasing she employs - like all great singers, she gives a certain emphasis to key words in these songs. This is where the Billie Holiday comparisons come in. To anyone truly in tune with music, this introspective album touches upon longing and love in very unique ways. The legendary Hank Williams song, Cold Cold Heart which has been recorded by hundreds of other artists and is familiar to everyone, is given a new interpretation that is just great. Come Away with Me and Don't Know Why are favs as well. This evokes a mood like Miles's Kind of Blue, a touch bitter sweet, whispered, and cool."
5,Sultry & sexy,"Turn out the lights, hold your loved once close and be enveloped in the smooth, sultry tones of Norah who sings with a feeling that disguises her age. Great vocals. Cannot wait for her next CD."
2,Perhaps not...,"I bought this CD and while I found it mildly enjoyable - it is hardly deserving of the effusive reviews nor is Miss. Jones to be compared to Billie Holiday. She lacks the sophisticated improvisations, versatility, and interpretative talent of a true jazz musician. While she is certainly talented her delivery is uninspired at best.I understand that this is her first album and perhaps her potential will be developed on future releases or perhaps not...At any rate, I've put aside this CD since I found it disappointing and have taken refuge in the exceptional talents of her label mate - Cassandra Wilson....."
3,serves it's purpose,"I'm a hairstylist, and this makes for a great easy listening/background music CD for at work. I would be hard pressed to rock out to it though or even get really excited about listening to it. I would not listen to it at home unless I was having a dinner party."
3,Not bad for a debut album....,"Voice - 4 starsLyrics/Melodies - 2 starsShe's only 22 years old, has a great voice, however, I believe that this album was overly-hyped and the majority of the songs were too jazzy for my taste. Don't get me wrong, she's a great singer...but I strongly believe as she continues to mature, she will continue to produce better and more genuine songs.It's a mediocre album for sure."
5,great album,SACD sounds even better. She's been trying different styles collaborating with musicians of different genre. but this is by far her best album. it suits her voice. i wish she would make more albums like this.
5,Arresting,"Although Norah Jones is young, she is an extremely talented artist. I received my first Norah Jones cd as a mother's day present--what a wonderful gift!!! Her music is absolutely arresting--I was captivated before the cd even finished! I now own all her CDs."
5,My favorite CD!,"This is a fantastic CD! The music is simple, and Nora's voice is beautiful. It is thoughtful, romantic and sexy. Unlike many CD's that have only one or two cuts worth listening to, every song on this CD is enjoyable. Definitely worth the investment!"
4,Good stuff,"Because Norah Jones's voice is disarmingly calm and cool, it is difficult to NOT enjoy this music. Her voice is very pretty, and her piano playing is at least adequate (sorry, but it's not that difficult). Nonetheless, the kicker is ""Cold Cold Heart,"" which I'm sure Hank Williams never expected would be treated like this. ""Come Away with Me"" and ""Don't Know Why"" best exemplify her ability to not put too much power into a song and yet still have the emotional aspects come through loud and clear. Definitely recommended for those who want a bridge between pop and jazz."
5,Come away with Me,"This is the best, ""best"" CD that I have heard in a long time. The combination of her smooth voice and music, she is going to be around for a long time, so get used to her name and sound, you are going to be listening to it for quite some time. Two thumbs up!"
4,jazz makes good,"When a non-mainstream artist makes some kind of impact on the charts, he or she becomes some kind of a focal point. At the age of 22, Norah Jones has exceeded many xpectations of her.Come Away With Me serves best at introducing the masses to jazz music. While not overly jazzy to alienate mainstream listeners, the singer infuses some form of modernity to the songs and past masterpieces to bring jazz music to a whole new level through her interpretation. Jones may not hide her inexperience, her efforts are by no means inadequate.Though still far from the likeness of Grammy winner Diana Krall, both Krall and Jones seek to bring the genre into the limelight and gladly, more people can discover the wonders of jazz music."
2,Totally Over-hyped,"I don't see what all the fuss is about, to me the only good tracks on the CD are ""Don't Know Why"" and ""I've Got To See You Again"". In my book a CD with only 2 good tracks is nothing to brag about. I think Diana Krall is a far better choice in this music style."
3,Good but not jazz,"I bought this CD wary that it might be smooth jazz. But I was wrong; in fact, it is not jazz at all. The only thing jazz-like about this cd is that Blue Note issued it. Nevertheless, her voice is nice and interesting. If you like country-folk type of music, you probably will very mcuh enjoy this music."
2,Nice voice but Jazz/Blues? I think not.,"For those who expected the style to be Jazz/Blues/Country will likely find the tendency to more country. Not my taste. At times he voice is a little raspy and bluesy but there is distinct ""twang"" that stands out in her voice along with the requistie country steel guitar. Overall, I do like her voice but the combination of a lackluster music selection and a definite country slant just doesn't work for me. Comparison to Diana Krall are inappropriate."
5,Norah Jones,Norah Jones is another really relaxing CD. We just love the thought of throwing in a few CDs and chilling out after a long hard day at work.
3,Good CD but listen to her sister,"You have got to see Anoushka Shankar, Norah's sister in Concert for George and you will see why. Dont take my word for it. She will floor you!"
1,Not for the straight-ahead Jazz or Blues Fan,"I would call it more ""soft country"" than a Jazz album. I listened to it a few times, and sold it, as every song sounded the same. Norah can't compare to Eva Cassidy."
2,Overrated...,"Norah Jones is very overrated. So is this cd. I only gave it two stars because there are two good songs..""Come Away With Me"" and ""Don't know why"". I don't understand why she won a grammy. I know she is a jazz singer, but her music is so bland. I mean you can be a jazz singer with some funk and personality. Look at Billie Holiday. Well I don't recommend this album..all the songs sound almost exactly alike. Buy Alicia keys ""Songs in A minor"" instead."
1,"Sorry, but she's just another pop voice","I'm always on the lookout and hoping for a young representive for the classic standards. After hearing pretty Ms. Jones I have to admit I was very disappointed. The voice is mature I'll warrant you. It's old beyond it's years!! It appears to be wrecked! She presents a song (esp. Nearness of You) with a breathiness that she must think passes for style. Hopefully, she'll stick to the pop stuff and leave the standards alone. She really doesn't know what she's singing about."
1,tedious snooze-fest,"Norah Jones introduces us to seven dwarves for the new milennium - this album is sleepy, samey, insipid, boring, mediocre, overrated, and derivative.Oh, and by the way, it's most definitely NOT JAZZ.Don't believe the hype."
1,Sorry I bought Norah Jones,"""Come Away with Me"" was a big disappointment. All the songs sound the same; there is no change in rhythm, tempo, voice range or piano composition. One song seems suspiciously similar to one by Leonard Cohen, with just a few of the words changed. I hope I can sell this CD. Although Norah is a sultry beauty, her talents in voice and piano leave much to be desired."
1,"Good music, BAD Compact Disk","So I really like Norah Jones and liked the songs on this CD. It is the CD quality that is unacceptable. I bought the CD from Amazon and it skipped/made unusual noises as the CD played (I tried four different CD players - obviously not a player problem). I returned that copy and Amazon sent me a new one. That did the same thing and would not even play in my car CD player - IT'S NOT A REAL CD, but rather is some fake. I retured that copy and am out shippling costs. Bah!Very disappointed with Amazon for selling such a thing."
1,Snoozefest 2003,"Oh c'mon now, you know this is so tired. Album should have been titled ""Songs for Middle-Aged Yuppies Who Think They're Hip."" Throw this in the bargain bin along with Lou Bega and Eiffel 65 CDs. I ""don't know why"" this got as much attention as it has, certainly unworthy of all the Grammy wins."
2,What is all the fuss about????,"I find Norah Jones vocals to be boring at best. My daughters had more exciting voices when they were 6. It amazes and saddens me to see someone like Norah Jones have the record sales she does, while singers like Debelah Morgan with an unbelievable voice fade into obscurity. But then, with ""singers"" like 50 Cent leading in record sales as well, I guess I shouldn't be so surprised."
1,I Dont Knoow Why I didn't buy a different cd....,"Ugh...if you need to sleep, need a lullaby, then here you go. norah Jones has NO, I mean NO, vocal range! She stays on one raspy note in her raspy, ANNOYING voice!""Seven Years"" would have made me cry...if sung by someone with vocal talent. I'm 14 and can sing better than her!If you want GREAT music, check out Michelle branch's ""Hotel Paper,"" which I'm listening to as I write.DON'T LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE!"
1,Snorah Jones,"Bland, derivitive, unispired, underwhelming, no passion, no emotion, a waste of resources. And those are the good points of this piece of garbage. She butchered Cold Cold Heart, and for that should be banned from Texas, and from ever recording again. Someone please book her another gig at the second rate hotel lounge where she belongs."
1,A Jazz Singer?!,"When I first heard this CD, I knew nothing of Norah Jones. My first impression was that she sounded like a teeny-bopper country music [hopeful]. I still don't understand why the word ""jazz"" is so frequently mentioned when referring to her style/voice. I personally did not like her voice or this CD AT ALL. I'm glad I didn't buy it, but I still feel sorry for my friend who wasted her money on it."
3,Slightly Better than Average,"having been told of Norah Jones&seeing a On-Line Performance of Her&Charlie Hunter&Group I thought She might have some Juice.but after listening to this Album&hearing the Arrangements She is More Closer to Another Alica Keys only with the Blue Note Record Tag.Keys got over&has a Real Middle of the Road Vibe&that's what I felt after Hearing Norah Jones.Talent is there but Like Keys The Soul,Warmth&Depth is Missing in Action.hopefully with time things will start to Cook.this isn't fully it.She has something but The Hype ain't Matched Yet."
5,Brilliant,Truly Norah Jones is one of the best things to happen in music and album deserves every bit of the credit it has gotten yet. Every song is absolutely exceptional and original (even classics such as the Nearness of You) and makes you feel really good. This is great music no matter where you are.
5,She deserves all five of them,"In 2002, Norah Jones won 5 Grammys forRecord of the Year (Don't Know Why)Album of the Year (Come Away With Me)Best New ArtistBest Female Pop Vocal Performance (Don't Know Why)Best Pop Vocal Album (Come Away With Me)She rightfully earned each award. Her music is inspirational, and is an amazing collaboration of pop vocals with a jazzy flavor which is related to the folk music in the 60s. I say related because it is really something you need to hear for yourself. Norah's voice is seductive, sultry and exquisite. Her words are real and I can to relate to them. I love all of her songs: My favs are ""I Have to See You Again"", ""Don't Know Why"", ""Lonestar"", & ""Feeling the Same Way"""
4,A Fine Album by an Innovative Singer,"I am charmed by this album by Norah Jones. This CD was so good, jazz songstress Diana Krall copied it's style in her newest CD called ""Girl in the Other Room""... and it can't come close to this, the original. Jones is sultry, spicy, but never dull. She can pour emotion into a song with great style and remain her own woman. I like this one and recommend it highly. Accept NO substitutes if this is your kind of music.. this is the best of the crop!"
5,The best CD I own...,"I bought ""Come Away with Me"" after I heard the title song on Smallville. This is an AMAZING CD. It's ""soaking-in-a-hot-tub-with-candles-lit"" music, it's baby-makin music, it's get-in-the-mood-music, it's chill-and-put-your-feet-up-after-a-long-hard-day music. It's really anything that you want it to be if you need to relax for any reason. BUY THIS CD! You won't regret it!"
3,Nice Enough,"If compared to other women her age who are topping the music charts, then Nora Jones is certainly a gem and deserving of all the praise she's receiving. It seems though that these accolades come from tired ears yearning for something innovative and unique. Jones's voice is certainly smooth and lovely and sweet on the ears; there is no doubt that this is a raw talent and with a voice of her own. Her intelligent energy infuses each track; all of this shines when the songs are the most simple and truthful. But while this CD is fine for what it is, I wasn't blown away. Instead I found the music kind of bland, the lyrics trite and my ears nearly bled from boredom.The most enjoyable aspect of this CD is that it is a lovely glimmer of what could potentially come from Jones. For now, ""Come Away With Me"" is nice to throw on for a mellow dinner, or when you have less adventurous guests who think they like jazz."
4,Not Great but good,I was just looking at some of the recent negative reviews for this CD which I guess is backlash from all the awards it has recieved. Though this is not a truly great CD it is still good and an excellent debut for a young major artist. She reminds me of IndiaArie and I believe she has the chops to really put out that great album soon if she is not to affected by all the hype. Come away w/ me is a beautiful soft song and yes the lyrics do stay w/me throughout the day.
5,"Simply, beautiful.","The vocals are haunting, the instrumental part is quietly complimentary. There is power in the way that Ms. Jones sings, yet she never raises her voice above a piano bar volume. Check out track 7-Turn Me On for the DEFINITION of a soft & sexy voice. I can't possibly say enough good about this album. I actually stopped dead in my tracks when I heard it. I was in one of those chain bookstores and went to the customer service counter immediately to find out what was playing and purchase it. If you like Amy Mann, you'll probably like this. If you like Julie London, you'll probably like this. If you like starting Sunday morning with a cup of coffee and some gentle music, you will love this album. Don't deprive yourself, go ahead and buy it now before all you're friends start telling you about ""this great new album I picked up by Norah Jones."" ..."
5,"Outstanding, Refreshing, Inspirational","She's a great new talent and her music fills a gap in the market for female vocalist/pianoist. Her voice is velvet smooth and crisp and her keyboard touch is light and delicate. If you found her playing in some smokey bar, you'd want to stay and sip bourbon all night with her."
2,Just too thin a voice,"The music's good, but Norah Jones' voice just isn't enough of a voice to listen to a whole album. It lacks timbre and depth and richness and that made it difficult for me to listen to it more than a few times. None of her renditions stayed with me past the drive into work."
4,I liked this CD,"I recommend this CD if you like the kind of relaxing music that Norah sings. Very soothing and calming, I liked it a lot."
4,SIlky Smooth,A very listenable album with lots of great tracks in the inimitable Norah Jones' style. I really enjoy Norah Jones and if you like her you will like this album. The album is a 5* but the mp3 music sounds just a little muddy. Still a good buy and a solid 4*
5,Sad and sweet,"This is an extraordinary CD. Norah Jones' voice is heavenly. Putting her CD in your player will set a sweet romantic mood for you and your mate. I can't listen to her voice without smiling, and feeling a little sad.I recommend this for anyone who likes to LISTEN to music, not just play it in the background."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!!,"I first bought this CD because of the song, ""Don't Know Why"" as I enjoyed hearing it every time it came on the radio. After listening to this CD several times, I found that I love all of the songs. There's something about Norah Jones' style - jazzy, smokey, sometimes a bit country - whatever it is, it's perfect for work as well as home. I've turned several friends on this CD and they all love it! My husband loved it so much that I had to buy a copy of my own for work! Definitely an artist that I will follow!"
2,Don't expect too much,"It's funny, other people say that this wasnt what they were expecting in terms of where she came from, and I agree.This really isnt following in the footsteps of the legend of Ravi. A few musician friends said they saw her, and that she was very uninspired. I mean, for people who listen to Dildo or the like, I can imagine this being just what they've always wanted. For a daughter of Ravi Shankar, I'm very dissapointed that she took the easy way out."
1,zzzZZZzzzzz,"The Grammy Awards made too much out of this album. Probably because most of the Grammy Awards member voters were all old and deranged.....Norah Jones is 22, talented, but I don't like piano / jazz music. It's too boring. I fell in love with ""Don't Know Why"" and ""Come Away With Me""....only because I hear it at the store that I work at...100 times over and over AGAIN.The rest of the record sounds like it's on repeat (like most have said on their reviews.) It's good sleepy elevator music - if you enjoy that kind. I don't.She has already recorded some new tracks that should be out by next year. Hopefully they're more up beat.... She even said that she was ""bored of playing the same songs over each night"" during her concerts.....I'm glad Norah and I have something in common :)"
1,music for the dead,Big deal. Just what is this suppose to be; music for automated systems that put you on hold? How can anybody listen to this without becoming 100% bord? I'd rather buy a sound effects CD at least there is variety there.
1,"record one song over and over and over again, you'll save $","I wanted this CD so badly because I just was mesmorized by her voice and loved the music to ""Don't Know Why"". However, after listening to it once, I pretty much decided that it was like hearing the same song over and over and over again, to the point that I now hate this CD. I've listened to it probably about 4 times, and am anxiously awaiting to give it away. My coworkers won't let me play it because they insist that it sounds like my CD player is broken and playing the same song over and over and it puts them to sleep. Sorry Nora, you have a beautiful voice and I love the style, but can't you do a little more? So very dissappointed."
1,why the HYPE????,This is a very overrated cd. All songs sound the same and it would make great elevator or dinner music where you just needed soft noise. Great example of a record label and awards show working to promote one artist. Maybe it was worthy of 2 grammy's but not 5 or 6. Can't tell me there aren't other good artist's out there.
2,Disappointed,"I'm no jazz expert, in fact, it's not my preferred genre of choice, but I'm more into the old standards I suppose. I tried this cd from just being bombarded with ""Don't Know Why"" and even though there are one or two charmers on the cd, this turned out to be a major disappointment.I'm not saying that Ms. Jones isn't talented, her voice is lovely, but I expected a little more from all of the glowing reviews and praises that I had heard from everyone and their mother. It doesn't bug me that much that she didn't write many of her songs, hell, ""Turn Me On"" and ""Come Away With Me"" are the only two songs that I really like.Still, this one was a major disappointment for me. I regret not purchasing some Billie Holiday instead."
5,The Rule of Three,I basically have a rule of three. If I am reviewing the tracks of a CD for which I am unfamiliar and I like three of the tracks I consider it worth trying and buying. A first time listener of Norah Jones made me an instant fan. I bought the Come Away with Me CD and am captivated with each and every track. Not a bad song on the album. She may be a newcomer but her voice is hauntingly unique. . .possessing rich qualities of some of the best Blues / Jazz singers of the past. I have gone back to buy more of the same CD to give as gifts. Everyone I have gifted have also become instant fans of Ms. Jones.
5,Moving and Elegant,"Finally, a female singer who actually sings! Her eclectic choice of material really lets the listen hear her voice. Nothing is hidden behind studio-techniques or some hollow rhythms. This is a moody, graceful album, one that reminds you of both smoky rooms and Key West beaches.If you're a fan of Eva Cassidy or Patty Griffin, you'll adore Norah Jones!"
3,Disillusioned Listener,"I finally bought Norah's CD, very much excited after hearing her hit single and expecting more of the same. Her vocals come across very lethargic and where is the passion in these performances. I guess I don't get it. They say less is more, but this is ridiculous. These interpretations are too laid back for my taste. Perhaps she comes across better in live performances. A better bet would be Holly Cole's CD, ""Temptation"". I believe Norah owes a significant nod to this artist, a singer who'll never reach Norah's level of commercial and popular success, but an artist who achieves what Norah is trying to create much more interestingly, movingly, and successfully. Peace."
2,"Talented Yes, But EXTREMELY Sleep Inducing!!!!","Honestly, I tried to like Norah Jones's whole thing, but I am hard pressed to be interested on an ongoing basis.It's certainly NOT because of a lack of talent, nor for lack of capable musicians (she's got 'em both in spades), but the harsh truth is, her music is so monochromatic and one-dimensional, at least on disc. Doesn't she do anything besides MELLOW?These same songs, if given varying tempos and arrangements could've been very cool, but here, it's just the same danged thing over and over.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
2,Annoying after a while,"The first single, ""Don't Know Why"" is a very alluring tune. Its the reason I bought the album. However, the rest of the Cd gets boring and annoying after about three songs. Her voice is unique but the Cd holds no surprises. Every song sounds the same. Sorry Norah, I really wanted to love this CD."
4,"silky, sultry voice... I love it!","I think that this CD was an extremely good purchase. I have listened to it several times, and never seem to tire of it. I don't believe that she is overrated, as others suggest, because I feel that she has a truly beautiful and unique voice. I particularly love the smoky sweetness she imparts in ""Got to See You Again,"" and the pleasant mellowness of the title track. The only reason I didn't rate it with 5 stars is because I still would buy Diana Krall (in my opinion, the most amazing jazz singer) before Norah Jones if given a choice, and not every song on her CD appeals to me (I do forward through one or two tracks), whereas on Diana's, I do not. But all in all, it's a worthy CD of your attention and will provide you hours of listening pleasure. I'm sure we'll be hearing much more from her in the years to come."
5,My new favorite CD,"I personally like music off many different genres but have to admit that I've never been a big fan of jazz or piano. This album has broadened my tastes in music.I first discovered Norah Jones through her video. I remember thinking ""WOW! this is totally different from what they usually air on MTV or VH1"". Her voice caught my attention immediately and literally made me stop in my tracks. It is in not ""Flat"" or ""Boring"" as a couple other reviews have said. She has a rich, soulful, romantic quality that just lures you in and holds you there. Her musical training is evident and is a nice change from the other stuff that's on the charts.This album is not high energy, but who wants high energy all the time anyway? Great Saturday evening at home music. I love it and am looking forward to her next album very very much."
5,WONDERFUL,"Nora Jones music is so soothing and so relaxing when I drive home from work. I didn't think I would like it at first, but boy was I wrong. She has a voice that makes you forget about the hecktic day I'm coming from and makes me enter a relaxing evening. Buy Nora Jones CD. I'm sure you won't regret it!"
4,"The hype is, for once, warranted","Somebody thank Diana Krall for paving the way for this young stalwart. More beautiful, natural, and also a piano player, however, she has one thing she can hold over Krall's head: songwriting talent. Sure, she does some covers here and there (Hank Williams' ""Cold Cold Heart""), but proves more than her worth by offering up a smattering of her own as well.Her voice is a unique blend of Billie Holiday and Alana Davis, if she'd ever recorded a loungey jazz album such as this. It's honestly unfair to compare her to anyone but herself, however. She's created a mold to call her own. Get used to her name. You'll be hearing it on the lips of all soon."
4,Unique,"This is my first time listening to Norah Jones. It's a lot different than what I have become accustomed to. It is starting to grow on me and I think I am enjoying it more each time I listen to it. When it's all said and done, I'm very glad I bought it. It's good to try new things. Give it a try and I think you'll be glad you did."
2,My mom LOVES this CD,". . . and I can understand why. Norah Jones has a beautful voice, she works with great musicians like Bill Frisell, and each song is carefully crafted to sound perfect and not offend anyone. When I hear this album, I get bored. Norah Jones sings over one slow and classy song after another and I nod off, waiting patiently for something to happen. Thanks to the success of this CD, maybe she'll branch out on the next one. Maybe she'll try something less predictable."
3,Pleasant but not compelling,"There are a couple of cuts on this CD that stand out as wonderful, but in the main it is slow and a bit dreary. Jones doesn't have the best voice in the world but her styling is fine, and the supporting musicians are good. When you feel like relaxing background music, you can put this on the player, but don't expect to start dancing, singing along, or tapping your toes."
1,overrated,The Grammy's were kind to Norah. Her style is soothing but there is something missing. BORING is the word that comes to mind. Each song sounds the same. I'll bet anyone with a little training could sound as good
1,Big Disappointment,"I am a Eva Cassidy fan. I was told that I might like this CD. The production and engineering on the album is terrible. The piano often sounds like the microphone is too far away. The music is very flat. The first song on the CD is the only decent song on it. However, the musicianship and the quality of the recording could have easily been better..."
2,Makes me fall a sleep,Everytime I turn it on I fall asleep.Love her voice.Works better than a sleeping pill
4,nice to relax to,she's not the best artist in the whole wide world or anything like that but she is good and her music is calming to listen to. I like the fact that there are so many different music artists and musical styles and there are so many to choose from and those who want calming jazzy folk music can play this while someone else can blast hip hop or punk from them stereos.
3,Promising but incomplete,"First, I am not a fan of the ""untrained"" voice. Any professional singer owes it to his/her public to learn the correct way to use their instrument -- in this case the voice -- and while Norah's voice is pleasant, she has NO breath control and a lot of her notes just peter out into nothing.That said, the songs are OK. I liked this version of ""Cold, Cold Heart"", but didn't like the Hoagy Carmichael ""Nearness of You"". The other songs I was not familiar with and it may take a few more hearings before I feel comfortable with them. Pleasant, you know, but no standouts. What I was most impressed with was the album's production.So, now that she's won all those Grammy's, one assumes she will have enough money to take the voice lessons she needs. Then, who knows?"
1,Lack of voice,"I don't even know if what she does would qualify as a whisper or if she just has a very alarming vocal problem, but I know about vocal performance and it is completely missing. You could think that the feeling would compensate this, until you realise there's hardly any feeling either. Regarding the music, what can I say, blatant wannabe attempt at jazz."
1,NOT VERY ORIGINAL..TRY SOMETHING ELSE IF YOU WANT REAL JAZZ,"Well I am not impressed. I think she should develop her own style and stop the Macy Grey undertones. I notice a lot of people are commenting on her appearance, that should be irrelevant when it comes to great musical talent. Unfortunately it seems to add an extra star to a review if someone thinks you physically appeal to them as well....which is silly."
5,Excellent choice for any listener!,"Norah Jones rapts your attention with her sultry voice. Close your eyes and your in a dimly lit, smoky bar. This is not pop, it's the style of music that transcends time. It's great to sing along to in the car, or to get close by the fire. I bought this as an impulse purchase, and it quickly jumped the ranks to one of my favorite albums. Definitely a must have CD."
4,Good but not Amazing,"She has a great voice and make cute songs, but her music is not so fantastic as people think. Of course she's gonna win the Grammy Award for best new artist, cuz she is better than posers like Avril Lavigne . It's a good cd,the songs she made are well fit, but the original versions of the other songs are much better."
5,Silky without being sappy,"Norah, where have you been all my life? This is one smashing CD, and Norah knows how to use her voice to really get the most out of a song. She defines power under control. Well, maybe she doesn't define it, but she does it about as good as anyone I've ever heard. Her voice blends so well with this genre, and her experience in creating a mood through tone is plain to see.One thing I've noticed with this CD is that the tracks flow naturally by connecting to both the previous and the next. It's like watching a larger story unfold, and reminds me of watching a well-written movie. This is one you will be able to play from beginning to end without having to forward or skip.There's an uncanny gentleness in the music and Norah really shows her stuff by not over-stuffing flashy breaks and pops into the songs. She gives just the right amount and the right amount is perfect.I can only hope Norah pancakes out another breaker just like this one."
2,Stick with your day job.,"Norah's singing has very little depth. She joins the ranks of low volume, breathy female singers that look good on the album cover only."
2,"boring, flat, nothing new here","Received as a gift, was looking forward to listening to it, but quite disappointed. I don't know what the big deal is. There are far greater talents out there that haven't garnered this much hype. Okay to listen to if you are having trouble sleeping.To me, this is just another product of the popular music hype machine. Pretty face + okay voice with a new packaging twist= CD sales. Musically not much new or fresh here, even her voice is not all that distinctive or unique, though the musicians do a fine job backing her."
1,Garbagey and borin',"Hurl tomatoes at this rotten loser, just do anything to make her stop singing! This is pure music for octogenarians who remember the jazz age and actually want to relive it. I don't understand who would want to relive music like that, when we have three decades of great pop, rock, and rap. I can't belive she won 8 Grammies. That shows what the world has come to. I hate Nora Jones."
1,Miss Thing needs a personality transfusion NOW!,"Honey, you have a LONG way to go before you can join Ashanti and Beyonce in the big leagues. You need to get a new sound or change your clothes or something because you are too DULL. Get some flava, girlfriend! This CD is just not working. Not feeling it at all."
5,Absolutely Beautiful Vocals Makes This A Must,"I have to say that this slow jazz/r&b/western/whatever genre is what I would never listen to. I'm more of a rap & rock listener. But this album is regularly in my cd player nowadays. Norah Jones' voice just puts me in a calm trance with her raspy yet sensual voice. She doesn't have an overly impressive range like Alicia Keys or Christina Aguliera, but its perfect for the rendition of songs she performs on this album. My favorites have to be ""Don't Know Why"", ""Cold Cold Heart"", and the cover song ""Come Away With Me"". I think everyone should try listening to Norah Jones. Its already a guilty pleasure of mine.:)"
3,"Good album, bad packaging","This is a really good album, however the quality of the vinyl record (little over 100 grams of vinyl) was fairly poor for today's standard. The record didn't come with a plastic sleeve, just a paper one with a hole to see the label. Other records i've bough came with an anti-static sleeve offering much more protection."
3,A far cry compare to the LP version of this album,"This SACD seems to be an after thought. I have the LP version of this album, it is a very good recording album on LP. The SACD, on the other hand, lost all the dynamics, as if it sounds somewhat muffed. I don't understand this. The recording engineer who produced the SACD should be fired. What a shame."
4,Introducing Ms. Jones ...,"Need there be any doubt about Norah Jones' talent, just look at her debut: a multi Grammy winner ... this is impressive when you look at the talent she was up against (i.e. Eminem, Bruce Springsteen, etc.) This album is rather good. I like 'Don't Know Why', the title track, the list goes on. All of the songs keep getting better and better with repeated listens. I remember the first time I heard 'Don't Know Why' on the radio, I was hooked. I didn't know who was singing this fresh sounding song on the radio. For some reason, I thought of Billy Holiday, hmmmmm.... It took me awhile to finally realize that it was Ms. Jones. Best of all, she is in her early 20's. I'm sure there will be a lot more to come. After buying 'Come Away with Me' and listening to it several times, I'm really impressed. A four star album"
2,Maybe she's more interesting live?,"A couple of friends told me they thought I'd enjoy this album--maybe because I'm a big Madeleine Peyroux fan--but when I received it as a gift I found it dull. Monotonous. Soporific. Limp. Depressing.Jones has a good voice, sure, but to my ear, she sings without feeling or nuance, like she's giving a recital at school. She sounds bored, and she certainly bored me."
5,simply touching,"I bought this CD after hearing the track ""Don't know why"" and have never been so happy with a new artist as I was in finding this one.Norah is definitely haunting, and contrary to comments that she is somehow shallow or too slow, the slow tracks are extremely moving.Listen to the words, feel the melancholy and enjoy it. Come away with me is inspiring... to do just that; ask someone to go away with you; hear ""I've got to see you again"" and feel the need to see someone again - just because you can't get them out of your head - listen to ""The Long day is over"" and apply that thought to life and loveIt has been an incredible few weeks of listening to her. I am greatly anticipating her next albums and am trying to locate concerts.It's worth your money (however hard it was to earn) especially if you are a passionate person and want to lose yourself in songs that touch the heart."
3,Not a bad first effort,"My feelings about this album fall somewhere in the middle of previous reviews. I would have given it three and a half stars but didn't see that as an option. Make no mistake, Norah Jones is a breath of fresh air in the jazz (with a little bit of country)female vocalist arena. Those like me who were dismayed at Diana Krall's fall into glam-jazz-for-easy-listening should take heart that Norah Jones represents a fresh voice. There are great songs, namely ""Don't know why I didn't come"" and others. Much of the album however does feel repetitive and can become little more than sophisticated background music. That said, the potential for greatness is definetly there and this is hardly a bad first effort - give her a chance folks!! And for goodness sake, keep this woman away from Ballard who managed to ruin the very promising Shelby Lynne."
5,Paired down elegance,"In reading some of the reviews, a lot of people came upon this cd with expectations of what genre Norah Jones would (should) fit. I had no notion what scope of diversity this cd had for me- and I gotta tell you I was FLOORED by the simple elegance of it. Her voice, arrangements and choice of covers impressed my need for torchlit harmonies. It doesn't fit a complete jazz category nor does it fall into folk category neither. But if there was one CD I recommended to those who love jazz and folk, telling them to leave their expectations open, this is it. I just let go of any pretense of what it should be and I have to tell you, it's a beautiful breeze of originality."
1,One Hit Wonder?,Thats right Track number one is the only thing worth listening too. After that the rest put me to sleep . Arif hired all the big names to back her up but they fell asleep too. On most of the song she plays pianismo on the keys and is singing to just herself in a little room. The roots and presentation of the song make me wonder Bluegrass? Jazz? Country? Pop?. So I sold the CD to someone at the Office. Yes Norah has a fine voice on the next CD please lose that annoying whisper and pick up the tempo Like maybe a collection of jazzy songs that were on Diana Kralls earlier CD's.
1,Lounge muzak,"This kind of singing might be acceptable in the lounge of a third-rate Vegas hotel, but what all the hype is about is certainly beyond me. When Jones tries for intimacy, she mostly provides breathy gook; when she goes for volume, she's just strident. She is in tune most of the time, but that's little compensation for what's on this disc. Can a duets disc with Josh Groban be far behind?"
2,cub away wif be,"Norah Jones... either she ought to have her deviated septum fixed or she was suffering from a head cold when she cut this album. In either case, perhaps Amazon should put together a two-cd deal featuring Norah Jones and one of Jonathan Richman's records. Stuffy-nose pop fans, rejoice!But seriously folks, this stuff is not music. If you want to hear comatose jazz stylings, check out Blossom Dearie Sings Comden and Green or her version of Someone to Watch Over Me. This is pure heroin. You bang it in the mainline and fall back on the flophouse bed with the hypo still sticking out of your arm. Norah Jones, on the other hand, is not satisfied until her tracks ramp up to some up-tempo peak of countryfication. Just so you know she means it when she whispers out, ""Cub away wif be... inna dight."" Sounds suspiciously like the cold sufferer on a Nyquil commercial."
1,Boring and bland!,"This album is simply boring. Songs are bland, interpretation uninspiring. Don't let the meaningless marketing slogans trick you."
1,The return of 70's AM radio cheese-pop,"Norah Jones has the least distinctive voice in recent history. In this offering she quavers her way tenuously through several forgettable songs, unimaginatively arranged. Her pedestrian adult-contemporary is not quite bad enough to be enjoyed ironically, and not nearly good enough to be enjoyed at face value. Appearing soon in the cut-out bin at your local Sam Goody. If you enjoy this CD, you may want to consider one or more of the following: Air Supply Greatest Hits, The Best of Bread, or anything by Yanni."
1,How Bad Can It Get?,"I really have no clue as to why Norah is so successful. She doesn't have a good voice, and on top of that, this is one of the most boring albums I have ever heard. As another person said, her voice really doesn't do the song justice, and she didn't even write it. The song could have been good if they had given it to someone with a more powerful voice. Why in the world do critics feel that they need to catre to her? Well, I simply ""Don't Know Why"". Do not buy this pathetic album, there are so many better songs and albums out there."
4,as good as Dylan,"Being the number one best selling cd I have no idea what to say that the other reviews haven't covered yet. Norah must be doing something right that others have not done. Her music is something original, something new on the already mainstreamed radio. When I fist herd her I fell in love with her voice. In a way she has the same style as Bob Dylan. They both have a way to calm you down. It took me awhile to finally buy this. I'm not much of a jazz fan (I tend to like rock). Nara is one of the rare people that can cross over in to any genera. No matter what taste you have, country, rock, folk. You will love Norah."
2,Nothing unique about her style. Bland and lifeless!!!!!,"Because of too much hype about this young lady, I bought her CD. Well, I ended up giving it away. She just could not meet my standard of a jazz singer - the likes of Billie Holiday, Ella F, Dinah Washington etc. I do not recommend this CD to the REAL jazz fans. There is sameness of style throughout the tracks. It is very boring and monotonous."
2,Recording sucks,"Music is good (somewhat sleepy...) but something went wrong in the recording. The instrument balance is not so good and Norah's voice is badly recorded, too rough."
3,Wonderful music,I purchased this CD many years ago and the music is still as wonderful today as it was back then!
5,TRULY EXTROIDINARY,"I first heard Norah's song ""Don't know Why"" on the radio station and was blown away, Then, I heard her on the hit TV Show PROVIDENCE and knew I had to go and buy her CD!!!! They played the song ""Turn Me On"" and I loved the song. Her vocals, instrumental talent are beautiful... This CD makes you want to just melt.... Sooooo Amazing"
5,Excellent CD,"Listening to this woman's voice is like nails tearing into me. It hurts, but few things are able to scratch that deep; it's refreshing. She is able to convey some actual emotion into her words. The music seems somehow classic, like it should belong on vinyl.The album seems short ,thankfully it doesn't grow tiresome after being repeated again and again. I hope you enjoy it as well."
5,Norah Jones sweeps the Grammy's,"When Norah won all those Grammy's, I missed it that year. That night on the news and the next day in the paper all I did was hear about Norah Jones. I went right out and purchased it. I got home, played it and fell in love with her voice and she's easy on the eyes too. I love all her songs on it and played them over and over. My favorite song is 'I've Got To See You Again'. I just love the melody and the words to the song. I've since became a hugh fan of hers."
3,ONLY 22?!?,"DIANNA KRALLS' FINE BUT I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE ""FLAVOR OF THE DAY"" JAZZ SINGERS FOR 20 YEARS.WHAT GETS ME TO BUY A CD IS SOMETHING THAT SEPERATES IT FROM THE REST.LIKE TOM WAITS NORAH ROBERTS AIN'T AFRAID TO TAKE A RISK.IS IT GREAT?..NO.CAN YOU PIGEON HOLE HER VOICE INTO ANY GIVING COMPARISON?FOR ME SHE BRINGS TO MIND 20 DIFFERENT SINGERS WICH MAKES THAT ""COMPARISON VOICES"" DEBATE MUTE FOR ME.SHE EVEN WRITES HER OWN SONGS!I ADMIRE THE RISK THAT SHE TOOK BY KEEPING THE GREAT MUSICIANS ON THIS ALBUM BEHIND HER TO RELY ON HER OWN VOICE AND STYLE.SURELY THIS WILL DISSAPOINT SOME SOME MUSIC AFFICIANADOS BUT THIS IS GOING TO PAY OFF.LOOK FOR A MUSIC AWARD WIN[you know the one]ON THIS OR HER NEXT ALBUM."
3,A Star is Gestating,"Norah Jones' First Sessions epee, available through the artist on the internet (...), was a minor miracle. Here was a singer who actually connected with and seemed part of her music. She swept you away in her private reverie. Sadly, that vibe doesn't translate nearly as well on her major league debut. Arif Mardin does what he was hired to do and brings on distracting sheen and polish, as well as a puzzling sense of distance and cool. Here, Norah's vocals sound more studied and less intimate. Several songs from First Sessions show up on Come Away With Me as well, but haven't gained a thing from the translation. Much of the new stuff - Seven Years, Painter Song - barely registers at all. And a Cassandra Wilson turn on Cold, Cold Heart seems ill advised as Norah is all about warmth where Cassandra is the queen of cool. Here's hoping Norah gets back to the First Sessions vibe on her next outing, because she's clearly got what it takes."
4,Norah Should Stay in the Studio,"I just attended the Norah Jones concert last night in Berkeley, too. The sound mix was horrible, the concert had no momentum, and Norah had zero stage presence.Better to buy her CD's and listen to them in your own home. The concert experience was extremely disappointing."
4,A fine cd by a young and talented artist,Please don't be put off by the negative reviews... This is a fine album by a young and talented artist. Norah Jones has a sultry and sophisticated voice that belies her youth and is well suited to the musical selections on this cd. This is one of those rare mainstream albums that crosses generation gaps and the whole family can enjoy.
5,Unbelievable Voice and Great CD,"The first tiime I heard ""Don't Know Why"" I was blown away by that incredible, awesome voice. I didn't even know who sang that song, but I knew I needed to track down this CD. Well, Norah Jones is an incredible talent. She has one of the greatest musical voices I have ever heard. She is that good. Her singing will send chills down your spine. I bought the CD just to have that one song. But, as others have said, there are many other really good songs, such as One Flight Down.Buy this CD - you won't be disappointed."
5,Best CD of the year,"As a music lover, I enjoy listening to new artists break through into the world of music. This is the best CD that I have heard all year. Norah's blend of piano melodies and her voice smoke through the cd and lull the listener into a relaxed calm. To call her music just jazz is an insult. Her music is so much more layered than that, with a blend of jazz, blues, and old world style. Her music is rich beyond her age, and is well worthwhile. If you only buy one cd this year, this is the one to choose. I highly recommend it to any music lover."
3,Lacking soul...,"After avoiding the hype for a long while, I finally purchased this album upon seeing my favorite new artist compared to Norah Jones. While the songs are performed with precision and polished to perfection, they lack emotional involvement. Why should I be interested in Norah's songs when she doesn't even seem to be interested herself? In the future, I envision this being the sort of music that will be created by Artificial Intelligence..."
2,"pleasant enough, but not exciting","this is a pleasant cd to listen to over a dinner or maybe on a sunday morning. but it doesn't do a whole lot for me in terms of making me feel something about the music or lyrics.i kept waiting for norah to stretch it out a bit. maybe kick in that voice a little more to give me something to get excited about. it never happened.she seems to have the ability/capacity to belt a little but i felt like she was holding back the whole cd.maybe she will get there. maybe she had bad advice from producers and recording execs.i also think she sounds like too many other female artists at certain times. there is nothing that sets her apart.give norah a listen and then follow it up with billie or eva cassidy. there is absolutely no comparison.it a solid cd, but the hype surrounding it is out of control."
3,"A Prodigious Singer, a Little Boring","On her official debut release, Come Away with Me, ""jazz"" vocalist Norah Jones evenly splits the difference between subtle and boring. There's no escaping that she's a prodigious singer. She feels her way into her material with grace, compassion and, best of all, intelligence. She has none of the preening or pretentious overreach of similar artists like, to use one example, Cassandra Wilson. Her gifts are in evidence on a broad range of material, from the Hoagy Carmichael chestnut ""The Nearness of You"" to Hank Williams's ""Cold Cold Heart"", both expertly rendered, to her own ""Nightingale"", the CD's standout. Still, I put jazz in quotes above because her phrasing never breaks an emotional sweat the way the greatest do (Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn), and, for all its pedigree (the Arif Mardin production, the label affiliation), the CD could just as easily have been released by Windham Hill, who might better market its soporific qualities."
4,Unbelievable maturity for a young artist,"An absolutely phenomenal voice!! The only thing that keeps me from giving this recording 5 stars is the production of the album. It's very raw, which I think is wonderfully appropriate, but her voice is very forward... to the point of throwing the album off balace slightly. Musically speaking however, she gets a very emphatic 5 stars. This album is just the beginning for this very talented young woman."
4,Good Jazz,"Norah Jones is truly a gem in the world of contemporary pop and in the more specific world of contemporary jazz. Too often the artists who have inherited the Jazz legacy of Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Benny Goodman have turned to the elevator music styles much in the fashion of Kenny G and others. While the tempo of Norah Jones does not match the speed or precision of those aforementioned greats, it is a far cry from the pathetic ""contemporary adult jazz"" that has ruined jazz. Bottomline: This girl has talent."
4,Distinguished Sound Indeed,"Although I don't think anyone can compare any artist to the phenomenal voice of Diana Krall, I think Norah Jones is a sound of her own. Her voice is very distinct in character and she captivates the mood in each of her songs. I've heard ""Don't Know Why"" several times not knowing the artist and finally the song would just be in my head so I had to find out ""who is this woman."" After reviewing her other songs I have been inspired to seek more!"
4,"okay ,but...","I brought this CD because people told me it was good. It's okay, but...tell you the truth, IT ALL SOUND THE SAME!! Every single song sounded the same to me. But her voice is beautiful, so I'm happy that I got it."
2,Disappointing CD,I was very disappointed with the CD. The CD didn't flow well to me and I am looking forward to selling it.
5,Nora Jones is talented...,"I'm a sucker for good music...The fact that i'm a 27 year old black guy who listens to jay-z, nas, Sade and anita baker does't mean i'm close minded to other music genre's. i especially like music that has a jazzy feel. To me Nora jones has a nice balance with her production and vocals..the girl got skills...don't knock it until you try it....peace"
3,CD-Norah-Come,"A very good CD. Very bluesy and jazzy, different. A gravely kind of voice on such a young girl. Playing in minor keys isn't easy and it sets the tone. Very well done."
4,A Great Escape!,"I work in a very noisey, chaotic enviornment. When I need to tune out the world and tune into my own strength to get something done, I pop this CD into my computer, don my headphones and I am immediately at ease and the work flows like nobody's business. It's soothing, calming, and the epitome of relaxation. I feel as though I have been transported away from 25 other co-workers trapped in a field of cubicles and into a convertable on a warm summer's day, driving through the desert at sunset!"
3,Norah scratches the surface with this one,"When I heard the first single from this album, I was pretty much hooked into buying the CD. However, after sampling the entire project, I came away feeling like it was good, but not THAT good. First, many of the songs are so short, by the time you get into the flow, it's over. Second, Norah Jones seems to be finding her niche as a songwriter and when she does, longer and more complex songs will emerge. In the meantime, this CD is a good time if you are hanging out with a significant other or just cleaning up around your place."
4,Fresh.,"I listened to Norah Jones first on PBS. Her story is of course interesting: she's the daughter of Ravi Shankar. Her music though is her own, and it is a bit like green wine, sweet and a bit intoxicating, but almost certain to get better with age."
5,Love to see a Norah album with her father Ravi Shankar,"I bought this album recently, and loved every song in it! Last week, while watching her Video on MTV, the VJ mentioned that Norah's dad is world famous sitarist Ravi Shankar. I would love to see Norah doing an album with him!"
5,What a pleasant change.,"I like all kinds of music, including the old jazz greats. Norah Jones is just a really welcome change from the stuff coming out of major studios these days. True musical talent seems hard to find among the oceans of teeny-pop, rap-metal, and cookie-cutter country. Norah Jones isn't just some pretty face dressed up for MTV; she's a MUSICIAN in every sense of the word. There is hardly anyone else out there recording this kind of soulful voice work. Kudos to Norah Jones, and thanks for giving us some real music to listen to again."
4,Eva Cassidy Returns...,"Norah Jones has a lovely voice. If she reminds me of anyone it's Eva Cassidy, but with a little added smokeyness. She has chosen to cover songs from Hank Williams (Cold Cold Heart) through Hoagy Charmichael (The Nearness of You) plus a few of her own, so she fits the ""Singer Songwriter"" description. The album is slow and moody, but her jazzy approach gives it a nice little swing. Let's hope she sticks around, I can't wait to see how she grows her talent."
2,Background noise,"Don't get me wrong, this is not such a bad piece of music (most buyers and reviewers seem more than satisfied). But, since Ms Jones is often referred to as a jazz musician, I feel obliged to point out that from the jazz point of view she has very little to offer.Not only does she come from country and pop music as much as she comes from jazz (at least at this album; I haven't listened to much of her other work), she has terrible influence world wide. Because of her financial success, all sorts of easy-listening singers get labeled jazz-divas even in my small country in South-East Europe.I hate to disagree with the popular vote, but for me this album falls somewhere between background music and background noise."
1,This is one of the worst SACD titles I own!,The sound on this is very anemic. The bass is almost non-existent. I've read this in other reviews but I had to see for myself since I love this album. It's true. Stick with the regular CD. Later Edit: I've decided it's not as bad as I first thought. What I said previously still applies but you won't be wasting your money on this.
2,Whatever music type it is...I like it. *Update* YUCK!,"Jazz? Pop? Starbuck's background music? I don't know. Does it have to have some deeper meaning or ""label"" to like it? No, of course not. Norah has a very soothing voice, pretty songs...overall well done. *UPDATE* I'm so sick of this ...CD! So overplayed...I think it's the same song twelve times...I'm so tired of this CD! Yuck!"
3,(Doing the so-so gesture with the wrist with fast twisting),"You wanna get an album that will blow your socks off that has a raw emotional feel? Get Fiona Apple's Tidal...Now!, don't just sit there, start looking for it. I give Fiona a gazillion stars!"
5,A Must Have,"I immediately fell in love with her voice without even seeing her. She just has the type of singing style you hope will be around forever. I am gonna tell on myself agewise, but she reminded me very much of Phoebe Snow, who was very popular in the 70's.Don't Know Why, of course, is the best song on this cd, but Come Away With Me, cuts deep into the soul if you listen carefully.This is a must have for any music collector of good new music."
1,Need A Nap? Here's The Ticket,"My wife and I had never heard of Norah Jones until the day after the Grammys this year when she carted home all sorts of trinkets. My wife assumed that winning the best pop artist award would signify a good pop album and thus picked up the disc. Wrong. Norah is a beautiful young woman and has a lovely voice, but the songs just have no spark. It was like listening to CSPAN with a piano. I can only assume that she received attention and overhype due to her father Ravi Shankar who was idolized by the Beatles (George Harrison in particular). But that connection doesn't make you great.I hope Norah ups the tempo on her next CD (it won't be hard to do) and maybe we can see what type of Pop Chops she has. But her career has Lauren Hill and Taste of Honey potential, so I hope she enjoys the success she's getting. I know I'll enjoy my sleep after listening to this."
1,Incredibly Over Rated,"Norah Jones sounds the same through all her albums. She sounds like she went to bed with a sore throat and woke up and started singing. She seems to have that feeling you get when someone walks in and flips the light on when you were asleep.She leaves her listeners the same way, bleary-eyed and half-asleep.Her 'mature voice' and style I've read about, and heard is less engaging than, say, Ben Stein with a twenty year, pack-a-day cigarette habit reading me his grocery list.In short, don't fall for the hype. Re-title her albums as 'music for insomniacs'."
2,14 identical songs,"I still have to find out if this CD has one loooong endless song, or a shorter one repeated 14 times?Good musicians, good arrangements, but in the whole is sooo boring. Maybe because the mix is bringing too much in front the voice.It's a girl that is singing for 1 hour, with a silent background track. If you love the voice of this girl, then it's okay, keep on listen to her singing. But there's not much music on the CD, just a girl, singing. All the time in the same way. Miau miau miau miaaaaau."
1,BUY THE VERY BEST OF CHER INSTEAD!,I cant stand NORAH JONES.This is not the cd for you.ITS AWFUL.I wouldnt buy it.I listened to it at a friends house.A MAJORdisappointment.BUY THE VERY BEST OF CHER INSTEAD.
4,It just keeps getting better,"The first listen was okay, but keep on listening to this one and it really mellows you out. Norah has a beautiful raspy, jazzy voice which grows on you."
2,"voice has amazing potential, but lacks maturity","I bought this because I had only heard a snipet of ""Don't know why"" and was captivated by Jones' voice. Unfortunately, once I listened to the CD, there was nothing holding me there. The music is flat and has no lasting holding power. I look forward to future Jones' albums, but this one is going in the bin."
5,How can I take it out of my cd player? Too Good,"This music is just to good for words. I like jazz that has style, this is just oozzing with style. Her voice will envlope you and make you fell that everything is perfect in the world. If you like the radio single, try the whole album, they are all just as good."
5,Magnificent!,"This has become our most listened to CD. The voice is sweet and rich at the same time, and the vocal style is without peer. We can't wait for the next release. We love female jazz/caberet vocals and have a decent collection. Nora Jones is at the top of our personal charts."
3,Not Great,"After hearing Don't Know Why, I had to hear more from Nora. But I am disappointed. The first 5 songs on the album are good, but after that the album just goes on and on and on, each song blending into the next and if it wasn't for silence between songs you wouldn't know when one song ends and the next begins. If you want a challenge, try listening to the whole CD without pressing the skip button."
4,A!,"I think that the Norah Jones album debute was an exceptional work by a young and becoming artist. I bought the album before I had known anything about Norah, her family ties or grammy nominations. And was very impressed with the tracks on the CD and instantly became a huge fan. I was shocked to hear that Norah was nominated for so many Grammy's and believed that they would overlook someone so sort of low key Adult Contemporary. I was actually stunned but excited that the Album was rewarded with so many Grammy's this year. I give it an A."
3,"Fine and Mellow, But How Memorable?","One has reason to be confident that all is not lost in the mostly synthetic, plastic, disposable modern scene of popular music when the public embraces such a warm, low-key album (and lovely, talented artist) such as this.Still, ""Come Away With Me"" is overpraised. While the songs themselves are quite agreeable, the languid, slow-paced fashion in which they're all arranged makes them sound too similar to each other. Thus Ms Jones wears out her welcome about two-thirds of the way through the CD. Make no mistake, though - this gal's one to watch."
5,Brilliance hits the mainstream!,"Stylish, classy, sexy in a demure manner, and definately confident! Something always comes along to break the trends of mainstream monotony. Norah Jones made this come true. Her music combines perfect elements of classic lounge jazz with a modern twist of pop and R&B. Sounds a bit strange maybe, but Norah Jones elegently opens her soul to seep into her music. I can't put my finger on exactly what I love about this intangible flowing creativity. , but just to sit and FEEL the music is enough. I'm not an extreme jazz style buff so I wouldn't know an exceptional amount concerning the technicality of this music, but I don't need to to be an ardent fan. Soulful music pours from her eyes, voice, and fingertips; the music bussiness revealing a true afficianado of an artist. I highly reccomend this album for any light-hearted soul listeners. I look forward to more imaginative, and simple (yet so elaborate in feeling)work from her in the future. 5 stars and a smile!"
5,Still a favorite,"I just have to say that I bought this album a couple weeks after it came out way back in February and instantly became one of my favorite CD's. The strange thing is that I usually listen to rap and never anything this mellow. I don't know why I like this CD, but even now, 10 months later, this album is still my favorite."
2,Catastophic 5.1 Mixing Error,"I love this Norah Jones album. The CD stereo and the SACD stereo mixes are excellent but they made a monumental error on the 5.1 mix. They have used the LFE channel in the 5.1 mix for the bass content but it has been mixed -10dB relative to the bass in the stereo mix. Heh guys this is an SACD, not a Dolby Digital decode where the LFE is boosted by 10dB on playback! We use the 5.1 analogue outs from my SACD player with no decoding or modification to the audio.I wrote to Blue Note but they did not reply. Fortunately I run a separate pre-amp for my bass and I can put the +10dB back however don't buy this SACD unless you can equilize the bass back to 'normal'.Just for the record, my system is calibrated. Bass management is still a very misunderstood beast. Hopefully Blue Note and Sony might get it right soon."
5,"the perfect album-and a first, no less","I picked the album up a few months ago and it has become one of my most played discs. Norah has it all-the music and lyrics and soulful emotions-and all are well beyond her years. Most songs are soothing, a few are a little peppy and together, all are a perfect mix. The piano licks are awesome. A super album."
2,Repeat....repeat...repeat,"Many of the songs sound the same. After listening to the CD a few times I found myself saying ""didn't I just hear that song?""I would recommend any of the Sade CDs over this one."
2,Should have previewed music,"The voice, of course, is impeccable but the music is so bad...I had anticipated jazz accompaniment for Nora but it was a blah, non- jazz group that ruined it for me. I will not listen to it. Wish l could exchange it. Will buy more of Nora but be careful with whom she is singing."
3,"A Prodigous Singer, A Little Boring","On her official debut release, Come Away with Me, ""jazz"" vocalist Norah Jones evenly splits the difference between subtle and boring. There's no escaping that she's a prodigious singer. She feels her way into her material with grace, compassion and, best of all, intelligence. She has none of the preening or pretentious overreach of similar artists like, to use one example, Cassandra Wilson. Her gifts are in evidence on a broad range of material, from the Hoagy Carmichael chestnut ""The Nearness of You"" to Hank Williams's ""Cold Cold Heart"", both expertly rendered, to her own ""Nightingale"", the CD's premiere standout. Still, I put jazz in quotes above because her phrasing never breaks an emotional sweat the way the greatest do (Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn), and, for all its pedigree (the Arif Mardin production, the label affiliation), the CD could just as easily have been released by Windham Hill, who might better market its soporific qualities."
5,Absolutely intoxicating!,"I heard one of Norah Jones songs on the radio and HAD to know who's voice it was. I was captivated, mesmerized and had to buy the CD. I've played it numerous times and enjoy it even more with each time I hear it. Slow, simple, yet provocative music. It's very relaxing and puts a smile on my face. It's amazing she's only 22 years old. I'm very impressed. I highly recommend this CD! You'll love it! Absolutely intoxicating!"
3,Like a lotta big deals....,"...in retrospect, I'm not really sure why this was so huge and caused so much commotion. I fully jumped on the bandwagon, drank the kool-aid, etc., at the time, but now...now, for me, this hasn't held up... I pulled it out the other day to listen to and it seemed so inert and workmanlike...hmmm, maybe it's time to put it in the trade-in pile...."
4,"Good debut, but not as spectacular as the Grammy's believe.","I love her voice. Norah Jones could sing me to sleep anytime her heart feels like it! She has a wonderful tool at her disposal and this is a great way to kick off a career. The only drawback I have heard in this release is that the tempo is pretty much the same all the way through the album. I would have liked to have seen Norah and her producer put a critical ear to the collection and realize that they needed a little more variety. Not that I want to hear her leading a few AC/DC tunes or anything, just a little different tempo and vocal variation. I can't wait to hear the follow-up to see if she can overcome the musical sophomore curse."
4,Amazing! A good album of the year! Who'd have thunk it? ;P,"This is a great, soulful CD. It's quite relaxing to listen to and a pleasant change of pace from today's pop! Thanks Norah!"
4,You'll Love It,I discovered Norah Jones last year and loved this cd the minute I got it. Norahs voice is so innocent yet seductive and the music is great. Its a wonderful mix of jazz and blues. You won't be sorry with this purchase.
3,Why the hype?,"I recently bought 'Feels Like Home' and 'Come Away with Me', and my question is, what's all the hype about? I think the arrangements are nice, and both albums set a mood, but they're sterile. I can't engage with the songs or the singer. There's nothing wrong with either, per se, but I just can't get involved. As I said in my other review, I also bought 'I Can;t Be New' by an artist called Susan Werner after listening to it on Amazon. The difference is amazing, and Susan is nowhere near the name that Norah is. I'd recommend her album for someone looking for something jazzy, relaxing, fun and intelligent too. Norah does take a good picture though."
4,You should come away with this album,"I admit; I've had my moments of hatin' on Norah. 8 Grammy's was absurd, particularly for a an artist that wrote..what?...two songs on her album.That said, this is still a solid album that is mellow without being monotonous, yet moving without being sappy. The songs are excellent, lyrically and melodically. She also has an exellent knack for interpreting the songs in the way she chooses to sing the song. The same songs, theoretically, could of fallen flat with a different singer. I can't say there is one bad song on the whole album. And ""I've Got to See You Again"" almost made we want to stand up and wave my arms in the air. Another stand out is ""Seven Years,"" a breath of fresh air that vicariously watches an innocent child.Buy it. listen, love it."
4,What a Wonderful Debut,"Norah Jones is going somewhere and my statement about that has nothing to do with grammy nominations. All you have to do is listen to this album and you'll realize this is a voice and expression in modern jazz that we've been waiting for. It's also, wonder of all wonders, the voice bringing jazz to the forefront in other musical genres, teaching those who would, not to box themselves in so tight they can't get out. The only qualm I have with Ms. Jones is her tendency to lower her voice almost to a whisper at certain points, thus disallowing the listener to hear what she is saying and to glean from that understanding and meaning of the song's lyrics. For this reason, the first time I heard the album I thought it was too flat, her voice too unemotional. Then I played it again and was astounded by the expression to be found in her voice when one has gotten past the surface listen and is digging deeper. ""Don't Know Why,"" ""Cold Cold Heart"" and ""Turn Me On"" are my favorite songs."
4,"Such Promise...,","None of the other reviewers mentioned Norah's piano work, so I thought I'd give the artist some credit. Norah accompanying Norah is really nice! I bought this album hoping for some upbeat jazz numbers. The first time I listened to it I was a little disappointed. Some of the country tunes are not my cup of tea, but Norah does them so distinctively and so beautifully that...well, I'm hooked. Let me tell you a secret: Norah can sing anything. It really doesn't matter what the genre is."
5,Who the heck is Norah Jones?,"Who the heck is Norah Jones? She has taken over my entire CD collection. I might as well throw away my Bonnie Raitt, Diana Krall, and others. She gets more play in this house than the Redskins. Without doubt, the best and now most played CD of my entire collection. For six weeks now, Come Away With Me, is played at least 5 times a week. You are guaranteed to fall in love with her voice, her selection, and the mood set by the CD's producers. A guaranteed winner..."
3,soothing and special,"it took me a while to grow accustomed to jone's lilting slightly scratchy voice, but i now consider this cd a must have for relaxing on rainy afternoons.her voice is very unique and that distinction makes her music (along with the combination of classic and modern repertiore) truly memorable.although i enjoy the calming effect of this album, i must admit that perhaps that soothing effect stems partly from the fact that jones makes every song sound almost exactly the same. the monotony is sublime, but i wouldn't buy another album sung by her simply b/c i don't think it would sound any different from this one."
5,"Simple, beautiful, charming","So many of these young, beautiful, female divas-to-be seem to want to use their powerful voices to beat the holy ... out of songs-- with too much ornamentation, too many notes, too much overdubbing, too much that is extraneous to the song itself. Not Norah Jones, although she too is young, beautiful, and a big star to be, I hope. She knows the songs, she loves the songs, and she does not use her considerable talents to overpower the songs. It doesn't have to be an adversarial relationship! (I blame Whitney Houston and her overblown ruination of Dolly Parton's inoffensive ""I Will Always Love You."")Norah Jones worked on her craft for the love of it in front of live audiences in teeny little cafes and grimy bars, not in front of marketers and test audiences and focus groups. Her work is honest and respectful of both the music and the audience. This is an impressive debut. I can't wait for the next one!"
5,"SOOTHING, SOFT, TRANQUIL","Loved Norah Jones' voice and every soft whispered note which was like the caress of a gentle breeze at the beach.I would have preferred to hear her burst forth in dynamic resonance on at least one uptempo song. Her selections are one-dimensional, all of the same mood. This lady can really sing and touch the Soul, but on this CD it's as if someone said- ""Keep it soft,"" and suppressed her natural exhuberant quality."
1,Mediocre - Get Eva Cassidy or Diana Krall Instead,"I was given this album as a gift, and I know I'm going against the popular grain here, but I have to say it like it is...her over-played radio ""hits"" were tolerable but after playing the overall collection of songs twice it just doesn't inspire me to play the CD again. (My wife says that she sounds like a cat ""yowling"" on a back fence - a little extreme).Fortunately, I had picked up CDs by Eva Cassidy & Diana Krall prior to receiving ""Come Away With Me"" and was blown away by their voices and musicianship...this made Norah Jones' efforts come off weak in comparison. In short...it's fashionable, one note music that's tolerable in the short term but I'll be curious to see if the music endures the test of time or if it goes the way of the ""Pet Rock"".UPDATE: Yep, she went the way of the ""Pet Rock"" - vindicated"
2,Not quite there yet...,"Maybe she's grown a bit, artistically, but listening to Norah Jones still leaves that tasteless flavour in my mouth, song after song. A typically hyped-up young figure, certainly a beautiful and charming face, but far from the consummate artist record companies will have you believe, Norah Jones still does not make it with me. Maybe one day she'll stop faking that seductive voice and start singing properly."
1,Nepotism helps,"Come off it folks! This over-hyped product is a album people will have comprehensively forgotten in a couple of years!Norah Jones has very little talent and her voice is dull and expressionless. You know it is!Let's get real - there is very little to talk about here. Norah Jones has been allowed to make an album an it is a crime that really talented and exciting young singers and musicians don't get opportunities like Ms Jones. Of course, having the great Ravi Shankar as your father does help!I wonder how many people who raved about this album have now changed their minds?"
5,"If she's this good at 22, she's going to be awesome at 30!","Her material is not even really my type of music but one listening won me over completely.I would agree with some of the comments about her style being a bit laconic, but I don't see it as a fault, really, just a style. In any case, she has to have some room to improve over the coming years; if she's this good now, just think how good she can be at 30 or 40!A truly outstanding first album!"
3,"Good friends, wine and Norah Jones's music","Without being a masterpiece in music, this CD is a jewel. Bring close friends to your home, open a good bottle of Shiraz and have a good time listening to Norah Jones's music."
4,"a very talented young woman, but...","The first time I heard her voice, I could not believe she was so young - so many influences, so much confidence. I can't fault her on singing the way SHE wants to. However, after a few songs, I want to hear something bigger - it can get a little boring, but still this gal is quite special and sultry. For those of you who need more ""umph"", try MARY FAHL's new release, The Other Side of Time. Fahl has tremendous pipes, interesting songs and lots of soul. Very dramatic tunes for sophisticated musical ears. Fahl could easily be the next big thing."
1,BORAH JONES!THIS CD IS TOO BORING AND BLAND!,This cd is boring.I listened to it.I WOULD NOT BUY IT.Save your money.Buy the VERY BEST OF CHER or BROADWAY MY WAY-LINDA EDER CD.CHER cds and LINDA EDER CDS are 100 times better.You wont be sorry.
1,Sounds like all other Jazz,"Didn't really seem all that special to me, sounded like all other jazz CDs, don't understand why she got so many grammies while other artists were ignored. Very disappointed, I'd recommend borrowing the CD before purchasing it."
1,Not worth the grammies,"I don't know what suddenly made Norah Jones the biggest artist of the year and sold millions of copies and won a jackpot of grammies. Did people forget about Jazz music? and now suddenly when there are few artists making jazz they decided to go for this. So called critics even compared her to Billie Holiday. But Norah Jones music is neither Jazz nor comparable to Billie Holiday. Sure the album is diffrent from the rest, and that's perhaps why it was hyped up. The music industry needed something diffrent to increase their budgets. ""Come away with me"" is a pretty dull album in general. A few decent songs but far from as unique as beeing said in the papers. Go find some real jazz albums instead."
1,Soothing or Boring?,"I guess there's no accounting for taste, so maybe I'll try to stick to the facts. This is an album of soft, poofy jazz-like softness, sparse instrumentation and homogeneous arrangments that do not make a statement. She sings competently with a breathy style, doing the exact same thing the exact same way. All the songs are pretty much exactly the same.If that's what you are into then you'll dig this. Personally, I'm into songs that have definite parts, and albums that have definite songs. I'm not impressed with Grammy winners. I like music.I had an Algebra teacher in high school that spoke in the same monotone for 55 minutes. You reaction to that will be your reaction to this record. Soothing...comforting...unchallenging...bland...it's an insomnia cure for me."
3,This is not The River; but it may lead you to it,"I listened to this twice, put it on my shelf, and haven't picked it up since. It's pleasant, but not the least bit memorable. Normally, I only rate albums that strike me at the ""5-star"" or ""4-star"" level, but I make an exception here for this reason: I can name you 7 women jazz singers who display better musicianship and are more stunning: Not necessarily in this order, Tierney Sutton; Jackie Ryan; Kendra Shank; Kate McGarry; Barbara Sfraga; Laurie Wheeler; and Katie Bull. Chances are great that all of the albums of all 7 of these women don't add up to the number of sales of this one. But if Norah Jones leads you to these 7, and in turn leads you to Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Betty Carter and Sarah Vaughan, then it's worth it. I.e., if Norah Jones proves to be the ""Blood Sweat and Tears"" of the Y-Generation, then this album served its purpose."
4,How does a woman of 22 learn to sing like this????,"Norah Jones is taking the country by STORM! This, her first CD, just came out 2 weeks ago and is already highly acclaimed. Her shows are sold-out wherever she plays!I feel priviledged to have access to WXPN-88.5 FM; a listener-sponsored radio station that has played a huge role in turning the NorthEast, and now- with the internet- the country, onto such talents as Dave Matthews, Keb Mo, David Grey, Moxie Fruvous, Susan Werner, Christine Lavin, and now Norah Jones.The whole disc is lushly listenable, but if all you got was her rendition of 'Cold,Cold Heart'(a Hank Williams tune), it'd still be well worth what you'll pay for it. Her interpretation on piano and her vocals are brilliantly understated and delicate- pure yummy jazz.Give it a listen! You'll want to own it."
2,"Like you Norah, I am Baffled!","At the Grammy awards, which she swept for some inexplicable reason, Norah Jones expressed amazement at her success with this CD. Well Norah, I would have to agree! After listening to the first four tracks, I could not take it any more. I really do not understand this woman's appeal, singing style, whatever you want to call it. I was totally underwhelmed. She is clearly a product of promotion. And I bought into it, big time. I succumbed and bought the CD. Oh well...If you, too, get the urge, listen to the brief track segments online first before making the plunge. Next time I will do that myself!"
4,Smooth...,"It's good to see so much young female artists in the Jazz Vocal world. Success came to Diana Krall, Cassandra Wilson and now it seems like the beautiful Norah Jones has that pleasure.""Come Away With Me"" is, in my opinion, an overrated record by the media. Norah has, indeed, a beautiful and gentle voice, and her interpretations have, at times, the likes of ""country-style"" female vocalists. This album has, globaly, a warm and soft sound, but Norah Jones never seems like she's falling asleep. I mean, there's always a strong feeling in her voice. She's there! The more fast tunes are there too and the melodies are instrumentaly rich.This is an album that worth a carefull listen. Jazz fans (like I am) will enjoy this work by a singer with... a smooth voice. Well done!"
3,Almost there...,"I really wanted to love this CD. I first heard the opening notes of ""Don't Know Why"" on VH1, and had to stop flipping channels to see why that channel was playing what I could only call Jazz. It's a great song, and her performance of it was so refreshing that I couldn't stop humming it.So I went to [her website] and downloaded the MP3s from her House of Blues performance, and I was blown away. She has some maturing to do, no doubt, but these live tracks (in particular, Bessie Smith) show a real talent.So why does the CD have relatively little of her great piano work? And how was it possible to suck most of the life out of this great live performer?There are some great tunes on this CD - but mostly I'm disappointed that the energy & talent on display in those MP3s is missing from this release."
4,Maybe a Must,"Norah Jones makes a powerful statement with her album, Come Away With Me. Here is a CD that can stand alone in listening circles, or escape into the backdrop of some raining afternoons. The amazing part of this album is the way it boldly stands alone in a world full of pop music. This is truely daring and original in the sense that it doesn't copy anything in today's trendy ""flash in the pan"" music. The great subtle sound of Norah Jones shouldn't be compared to Billie Holiday -- Norah Jones is able to blend in and become a wallflower much better than Ms Holiday. If you like a light sound and a warm friend on lazy days, this is a great album!"
2,Beautiful voice-but a little disappointed,"Norah has a lovely voice, but I was expecting a sound truer to the jazz genre. Her sound fits more closely in the folk category. If I knew this prior to purchasing the CD, more than likely I would not have bought it."
2,Pretty But Boring,"She has a beautiful voice, btu does nothing special with it or her material. I know she's extremely popular, but so was Lawrence Welk."
5,Enchanting,"Cut her a break--she's only 22. And yet she's soulful, gentle, and incandescent in this quietly beautiful album. Ignore all the hype over ""Don't Know Why""; the best songs on this album are the title track ""Come Away with Me,"" ""Lone Star,"" and ""I've Got to See You Again,"" which demonstrate assured style and understated taste. She has a way of making these (mostly) new songs sound like old, old classics that have been around forever--and surprisingly, gratefully, she's actually gotten the attention she well deserves. Here's hoping she has a long and beautiful career."
5,Come Away With Me,I believe this is the best of Norah Jones. Eclectic in sound yet very simple. A great Cd to listen to and sing along with!
5,romantic and easy listening music,"It has all probably been said before, but this album by Norah Jonesis smooth, sexy and easy-listening music that I have played severaltimes during the last 2 weeks. Each song is good."
2,This is not Jazz,"I am disappointed. Coming from Blue Note, I expected a jazz album, but this strikes me as ""soft country."" Norah's voice is too slow and mellow, with no real distinctive character - there is nothing here that would make you want to just sit down and listen to this music."
4,Blissful,"I just discovered this album because I don't do music shows and awards shows. This is so untypical of most music out there and that is why I like it. I love country, jazz, blues and this album melds all those together into something lovely, relaxing and blissful. I find myself humming ""come away with me"" or ""one flight down"" all day while working. I can't get them out of my head. As a kindergarten teacher when I play this at school all the girls start humming along and they all tell me their mom has this cd in the van or car. It must be a chick thing because every girlfriend of mine loves it. It is calming and refreshing. I will be giving this as a gift to all who matter to me."
4,An opening chapter to a career I want to follow.,"Norah Jones bears the slightest resemblance to a younger Natalie Merchant, which makes me wonder if this is what it would sound like if Natalie Merchant could actually sing. ""Don't Know Why"" brings to mind a delightfully woozy variation of Maria Muldaur's ""Midnight at the Oasis,"" and sets the tone for a delightful album of bluesy pop songs by a talented band. I wouldn't mind hearing some of Ms. Jones' piano licks sometime in the future, or hear her take a stab at some song that is Billie-Holiday-dark. She's young...so we will."
5,Jones on the Radio,"Recently I was travelling down the interstate late on a Monday night listening to the local UW-Milwaukee radio station. I was flipping through the stations searching for something good to listen to. Upon hearing ""Don't Know Why"", the dial stopped spinning as I was intently listening to her radio interview. She followed up that track by playing the title track, ""Come Away with Me"". There is a very unique quality to her voice and the music gels with it very well. I like its mellow quality and would recommend the CD to anyone who can appreciate music period."
2,Poor Man's Rickie Lee Jones,"Pop music is in a pretty bad state if this is what is being hyped. She's not bad, not untalented and possibly has a lot of potential, but you may find she's no big deal."
2,Boring,"What a boring CD. I played once put it away. Played it again just because....... still not impressed. Gave it away, My friend gave it back.Don't waist your time."
2,a good cd,I own this cd and love it.I love Noahs music.I highlyrecommend also BROADWAY MY WAY BY LINDA EDER.LINDA EDERis an incredible vocalist.Linda EDER can BELT out a songand hold a note for a long time.Buy BROADWAY MY WAY.
2,Where is the stop button please....,"A co-worker of mine played this cd at work during a quietevening shift. After 10 minutes of listening to this womengo on and on in that monotone voice, I was ready to scream,""somebody help me""! Now, this is just my opinion, but jeese,I thought that cd would never end. This cd gets irritating afterfive minutes of play. But that's just my opinion. I would not buy it!"
2,Sappy smooth jazz....,"Corinne Bailey Rae is attempting a Norah Jones imitation,but is better with her hit single ""Put your record on"" because she is spirited.She's evoking Billie Holiday in her songs&it; shows.In ""Come away with me"",Norah Jones sings sappy,overdone love songs.They're not so much romantic as melodramatic.Each song SOUNDS THE SAME.I worked at a job where my boss played this album OVER AND OVER.This album is supposed to have retro appeal,but it is an attempt to be blues from back in the day,and it doesn't succeed.The songs lack variety,and Norah Jones' singing style is grating rather than seductive.If you enjoy divas,go for Bebel Gilberto,Angelique Kidjo,India.Arie,the early Enya albums--but this is worth skipping."
1,Grammy ? How?,It is beyond me how this CD sold 8 million copies but that being said I should be in the studio now. I am a talented entertainer and I could produce a better product on my worst day. I am not trying to be arrogant but this work is methodic without any variations. I am quite disappointed that I bought it. The only track worth it's salt is the single that was played on the radio.Good Luck.
2,Not bad but I can't get past the fifth track,"I wouldn't say this album is particularly dissapointing unless of course you had very high expectations due to unrealistic promotion by the music business claiming she's the next big thing; in which case you probably deserved to get ripped off anyway. No, my low rating is not due to lack of quality - it's more the lack of soul; soul being an intangible thing which you cannot mimmick - sorry Norah. Due to this lack of soul I keep dozing off halfway through track 5 - the furthermost point I have got in the album. She's sort of mastered the technicalities of her art but not given enough of her soul; maybe she needs to slum it for a while."
2,Overrated,Norah Jones is not really anything special. Her songs all sound similar and most are quite bland. Norah Jones is not what I'd call a jazz singer. Her songs are pop with jazz influences.
2,An intriguing voice with nothing to say,"Norah has a beguiling voice, to say the least, and her piano playing is strong and confident. However, the songs on this CD are bland and boring, for the most part, and Norah doesn't do anything special with the songs that are decent: THE NEARNESS OF YOU is about par with most piano bar performers' renditions."
5,"oh sooo mellow, baby","Norah got like 7 someodd Emmys for this album, and she and the producers earned it. nothing like it. OK, she reminds me of a white Nina Simone. sultry, soft, sexy, and - well - mellow. love it.i play this CD at work and everyone loves it. in fact if there is a day that all the customers are being poopy - we put the CD on to calm every one down, and yes, it works!!good for fussy husbands too (sorry, hunk man, the love of my life!)"
2,Norah Jones,"I'm not much of a jazz lover; but I heard so many great things about this person Norah Jones, so I gave her a try. What was the big deal? Her voice is ok; I really didn't like this album too much. I did like ""Don't Know Why"", ""Come Away With Me"" and a few other ones, but that was it. I didn't what was so great about this album, but like I said, I really don't like jazz but I give any type of music a try; and this is not for me."
2,Snorah Jones - just another Natalie Merchant [copy],"Where can I start. First of all, ""Don't Know Why"" is the best song on this album. The rest of the songs blend into what seems to be the same repeated chords and lyrics. There is way better talent out there, and Norah got the Grammy's left and right, while that may be the case, I'm sure she cannot top her success with her next album. It's a good album, but she is totally copying Natalie Merchant. The piano, the looks, the shyness, etc. Just my heartfelt feeling."
2,Yawn,"All the songs are the same. Same tempo, minimal backing, similar vocal phrasing. I respect Jone's talent, but give me some spark! Maybe for a dinner pary or something, but for concentrated listening it doesn't cut it. I need some soul, baby! Maybe she has it, but I'm missing any sense of urgency or a sense that she's experienced stuff in her life. Maybe with age or a different song selection we'll see some more energy."
4,Heavenly Voice,"I heard the title track on the radio and asked my friend who it was, ""some 20-yearold"" and my mind immediately rushed back to the first time I heard Beth Orten - that delight at recognizing the maturity which is innate in any really good artist. However, there couldn't be a greater difference between NJ and BO in terms of style; Beth to me is edgy while Nora is the songbird. What a fabulous voice: dreamy, warm, sheets of honey dripping on starved lips. Wonderful stuff, can't wait for more."
5,Nora,I love the voice of this women and this disk does not disappoint. There is not a song on here that I do not like.It's sexy and soothing and I even listen while on the treadmill.
4,I Love This Cd,"I saw her in concert, when she opened for Dave Matthews Band. She rocked I loved her voice and that she's so real about it."
5,Fantastic,This CD is amazing. I cannot say enough about it. She is completely amazing. Her voice is so soothing and so awesome. I cannot wait for her to release even more recordings. This is a definite must buy!
2,MONOTONE!,"This CD is for those who have trouble sleeping. The first release song"" Don't know why"" is the only good thing about this CD. I wanted to love it but could not get past the monotone vocals and sad music."
5,Come Away With Me...Norah Jones,"What a lovely voice. I was hooked the first time I heard her sing. This is a replacement cd, as I literally wore out the first one I bought."
4,Norah on vinyl!!,Norah comes across in beutiful way on this vinyl pressing. Something very comforting and soothing from vinyl and Norah. Try it!
2,Not Grammy Gold,"This CD was better than the endless hours of radio play it received but not good enough to upset the hard work and dedication real singer/songwriters such as Bruce Springsteen have given us for over 30 years. The songs are nice if you're strapped in the backseat of your Father's Oldsmobile with windows that only roll down half-way. But if you are between the ages of 0-60 put this CD on your funeral-setlist and until then listen to likeable, knowledgable, creative, artistic, resourceful, eye-popping, heart-stopping, earthshakin', earthquakin', pants-droppin', Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band. What were the Grammy people thinking when they voted?"
2,"Musically uninteresting, despite talent of Ms. Jones","Norah can certainly sing. DON'T KNOW WHY is one of the most delicately beautiful songs I've ever heard. The genius of that song, I'm afraid, had absolutely nothing to do with the instrumentals backing her wonderful voice.The rest of the album is just as musically uninteresting. And without listening too hard to the songs, you could easily make the mistake of blocking out the instrumentals and only hearing her voice. An accapala album would have made more sense.While just as mellow as Beck's SEA CHANGE, that album at least had beautiful music surrounding the lead singer's heartbroken lyrics and performance, courtesy of Nigel Godrich of Radiohead fame.Ultimately, everything sort of sounds the same, and boring, despite the talent of Jones.Here's an idea, NJ, seek Nigel for your next album."
4,"Incredible voice, but shoot the drummer","Norah Jones is the Billie Holiday/Eva Cassidy/Nina Simone of today. Voice, timbre, phrasing, articulation are all outstanding. She communicates and fascinates, thoroughly sings real songs and writes them too.I predict a bright future for Norah immediately after she dumps the guy on the desk who thinks we bought this album to hear a drummer and the bored session musicians holding her back.Buy this album for those tracks where her voice gets top billing."
3,nothing SPECTACULAR,"i bought this album jsut because of the hype, and while it lives up to some of it, there are some songs on the album that just sound like fillers. dont know why, the radio single is a great song, and there are some other great gems on the album. i found the album to be a bit bland, though, and while her voice is unique, its not the strongest ive ever heard. the instrmentation throughout the tracks is mediocre at best and doesnt show her piano skills too much. if you are just buying the album for the piano playing, skip it. plus, she only wrote 2 of the songs on the whole album. she shows alot of promise though, and maybe she will get better as time progresses."
4,Very engaging,"Norah Jones' music can be an acquired taste, but once you like her, you realize that this is one of those silky voices that sounds great even without any accompanying music (although the piano sounded great). An unbelievably mellow voice for someone that young. Now I need to find a live Norah Jones concert!"
2,Expensive Broken Box,"I bought my Danby dishwasher and less than a year later, it broke! The closest approved repair person to me is 150+ miles away! It's not worth the 3 hour drive!"
1,do not buy this !!,i just bought this item today and to my dismay it does not fill up with water. its bran new and is BROKEN i guess you get what you pay for !
3,very good. very bad.,Awesome dishwasher until it broke just a few days after the one year warranty ended. The closest 3rd party repair person available didn't have the time to fix it for several weeks and the price to repair it was almost the original cost so I threw it in the trash.
1,Received wrong product,"Very unhappy. All records, including packing slip reflected SSX on Tour. When the box was opened Christmas Eve by my grandson, the game that was sent was SSX, not SSX on Tour. I can't begin to tell you how frustrating it was for me and how unhappy my grandson was!"
3,Not bad; could have been gorier,"You would think that a mystery box with something bad in it on a plane would cause a lot more problems. I wish. Still, it is a fairly decent thriller. I must say that Hamill has not aged well, though."
3,Okay to rent But!,If you like B movies then this is worth a rental. Ending could have been better. Movie has a slightly low budget feel to it.
1,hum all i can say.,i fell a sleep on this movie. did not keep my intrest at all. very slow and to the point.
5,Priceless Parker and other Gems,"This is my favorite of Bird's all-star collaborations captured on Verve. Although the medley left me wanting more of each song,it is a stunning showcase for underrated trumpeter Charlie Shavers, and tenorist Flip Phillips. It also has more than enough thrills for devotees of Benny Carter, Ben Webster, Oscar Peterson, and especially Johnny Hodges. The highlight of the CD is the final selection, Funky Blues, a Hodges original. Bird offers one of his most penetrating,inventive, and unforgettable solos here. Although Funky Blues is a slow tune, the utter soul of Oscar's piano accompaniment always make my feet move. Hodges also soars,and concedes nothing in the soul department. It's a nice contrast to hear him in a context outside Duke Ellington's orchestra. This is a rousing, infectious CD, essential to any jazz collection."
2,Unfortunately not so good,"I would use fewer than 20 words if I were allowed. I just want to say that unfortunately the sound quality of this recording is not very good. It's quite distorted, though the music is beautiful. I heard it in a store and couldn't tell then. But at home, on my home stereo, I was quite surprised and disappointed. 5 Stars for the music, no stars for the recording quality=2.5 stars"
5,lift-the-flap and recipes make a winning combination,"Blue is having a snack party. All her friends are bringing snacks. We discover what each is by lifting flaps that show the ingredients and recipe with the finished dish underneath. These are healthy snacks made by Steve, Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper, Mailbox, Tickety Tock, Shovel & Pail, and Magenta. In the meantime we help Steve solve Blue's Clues to discover what snack Blue will bring. A final picture of everyone with their snacks suggests the upcoming party will be festive indeed.A nice addition to the Blue's books."
4,Great Book for the Price,"My son is 2 1/2 and love Blues Clues, so this book was a win. It is interactive: lifts & flaps, and searches for ""blues clues."" Very colorful and exciting for a young child."
4,Good Reading,"Excellent material. My wife, kids and I have read it over and over again. Has it worked? I think so."
2,Disappointing...,"I've read each of John Case's books but this one disappointed me. It had none of the insightful, suspenseful twists that I have enjoyed in his other books. And it had no ending, it simply stopped which was to be expected as it really seemed more of a germ of an idea for a story as opposed to being a good story.I'll read his future books, but I don't recommend this one."
1,One of the worst,"I have a rule ... once I start a book I have to finish it. This was painful - this book is not bad ... it is horrible. Every page was a chore to get through. I picked up this book because I thought Genesis Code was such a fantastic book - while I read this one - I kept thinking - there is no way this is the same writer. So I went on line and did a search - it turns out that JOHN CASE is actually a husband and wife team.If a husband and wife team decides to write a book - admit it - hiding behind this pseudonymn is insulting to readers. I regret the two days I wasted on this piece of trash. I will never again pick up a ""John Case"" book!"
2,"Drags out...ending, where !!!","I just was trying a new author and so once I start a book, I finish it. This book was going okay until after the 3/4 way through...wife changes to be a nightmare...but very little about it....There is really no ending. I hate books that leave you hanging and that's what this one does.I will not purchase anymore of this author...there are too many good author's out there."
1,wrong information without a resolution,"The product shown on the page had student's edition (edition 2) different from the teacher's edition (edition 1). When I purchased the books which were side by side (both entitled Saxon 87), there were no indication that each books of differen editions. When I called the customner service, there was no resolution offered. I could not return the product. The teacher's edition to match the student's is no longer available in print. I do not recommend this experience."
3,THIS IS A GREAT MATH BOOK FOR 6TH GRADERS,"I HAD THIS BOOK IN SIXTH GRADE, AND IT WAS A GR8 BOOK. THE AUTHOR EXPLAINS EVERYTHING IN DETAIL, BUT THINGS CAN BE A BIT CONFUSING =)"
5,Stuntman,"This game is outrgeously fun and exciting, it is challenging yet simple. It is a great game for all ages and gendres. I really like that you can make your own stunts and test them to perfection. In a nutshell, this game is the best game i have played for PS2 and reccomend it to anyone and everyone."
1,MAJOR Disappointment,"I saw the commercials for this game and the game looked awesome. Until I bought it. I played it over and over again trying to just get past my first stunt. Some stunts are easy but if you go 1MPH too fast or 1MPH too slow or cut a corner too widely or not wide enough the blood vessels begin to burst from the frustration. Believe me, the only cool part about this game is the commercials."
2,Beware of this game if you like Grand Theft Auto 3,"I concur with the negative reviews. To echo: no checkpoints, disappointing graphics, annoying long static screens between attempts, short missions that don't forgive tiny mistakes. The game is worthy only of a PS1 console (four years ago) and it is the first video game that made my thumb hurt (X button for accelerate) since Enduro by Activision 20 years ago. I am gleeful that I only RENTED it after seeing the slick ads on television."
1,"Please, waste your money somewhere else","This game is super bad. It is difficult and very frustrating. Unlike some games where the challenge is figuring out the puzzle, this game makes you repeat and repeat the same move over and over. The load times are very long and very frequent. I'm sure if you spent years you could get good at it. In my opinion, a game has to be a little fun at first or who else but a masochist will want to play it.This game literally made me furious. To be fair, driving games usually aren't my cup of tea, but this game is a real turd. The graphics are good, not great, but solid. The only good thing about this game is that I rented it.If you like extremely hard driving games that take months to master, then this is right up your alley. If you like games that are fun and that you can play the first night without getting very angry, then stay away from this game.I hated it, I'm going to rent Way of the Samuri again, that is an awesome game."
1,Thank God for Blockbuster,"I am so glad I rented this game before I bought it. It is awful. It is so hard and there is no way to change it. In fact, even when the do finally complete a mission, usually after hours and hours of frustration, you figure out it wasn't fun. This game is just not fun. You cannot make a single mistake or you have to start all over and the load times are unbearably long. After 2 days of having it, I took it back. You have no idea what you are supposed to do until you have failed the mission 5 or 6 times. Also, when you have to chase a car, nothing happens to it but all of the AI cars try and hit you. It is rediculous.Do yourself a favor and get something else, anything else if you want a good game because this one will do nothing but frustrate and annoy you."
1,not worth it....,"This game is incredibly difficult. It has some of the longest loading times too. Unless you have the unlock everything code ""BindI"", do yourself a favor and skip this one."
3,"Fun, but unpolished.","I was a little disappointed with this game. I bought it the day it came out because I love driving games and it was a fresh take on the usual. However, there are some problems with the game. First of all, some missions have to be done over and over again, sometimes 20-50 times before you can go on (while others can be finished on 1 or 2 tries). The graphics are about on par with a last-generation PS1 game which makes you miss some of the obstacles and causes more frustration. The cars seem to flip over at the drop of a hat, ending the mission, and rarely can go above 80 miles an hour. The drone cars on the streets have absolutely no AI, and like to get in your way just to be a pain. Despite all this though, the game is very original and can be a lot of fun at times, but you will probably spend more time cursing like a sailor than enjoying this game."
1,Grand Auto Theft 3 is the Way to Go,Pros:Car handling is easy and responsiveCons:Lack of walk-throughs adds a needless level of difficulty to an already challenging gameThere are reload screens between each takeI would have probably rated it 2 stars but the fact that Grand Auto Theft 3 is out there I gave it a 1. Go to Grand Auto THeft 3. You won't regret it.
1,So freckin terrible!!!!!!!,"I had bought this weak crap in 7/16/03. If you think it was cool on the comerical, well your wrong! This game is so frustrating and it's not that fun. When you on the ""stunt constructor"" mode and you go up the ramp, it is fonny! When you get close to beat the hole game is was hard and gay. I could even beat the very last mission! Don't even buy this game because it is not good as you thought it was on t.v."
2,"YES, I'M DUMB AND WHITE AND I HATE STUNTMAN",I hate this game.Thankyou. Read my grand theft auto:vice city
4,I think its a realy good game,Stuntman is a fun but hard game i had truble beating the first couple of levals but i beat sevarl levals in one day that i rented it i meen i rented this game and loved it.It doesnt have gooood grapfics just so so grapfics and its gameplay is good i just love love love this game.But it costs [$] not exactly a walk in the park lol.I have Driver2 and its a good game its alot like Stuntman and the grapfics on Stuntman are alittle bit better than Driver2 so if you like Driver2 you will like this game....This is a good game get it!
5,Superb!,01010010 01101111 01101111 01101111 01100001 01100001 01110111 01110010 00100000 01101001 01110100 01110011 00100000 01100110 01110010 01101001 01100111 01100111 01101001 01101110 00100000 01100100 01100101 01101100 01101001 01100011 01101001 01101111 01110101 01110011 00100001
2,I gave up,"First, I am not a big-time gamer. I play the occasional game. I thought Stuntman looked like fun, all those cool stunts similar to the movies I grew up watching. However, after several hours of frustration I had managed to complete only a couple of stunts. The cars handle badly, the timing is very hard, even little things like a road sign stop your car like a steel wall. The reload time is terrible. If you have tons of time on your hands and live and die for gaming, maybe you will like the challenge. I have a life outside the PS2 so I will look for a game that is a little less demanding of my time."
2,I REALLY wanted to like this game.,"I saw this game at Blockbuster and I thought that I would fall in love with it. That is not the case. As you have read reviews from other players you can tell that this game is entirely too frustrating and the load screens are absolutely annoying. They are. Don't buy this game, instead I would suggest you merely rent it. Graphics and handling are good though."
4,Not for the Weak Gamers,I waited and waited for this game to come out and when the game finally came out i went to wal-mart and bought it with no hesitation. I really liked the game alot and played it for about 3 hours and got the first scene for the first movie done. I unfortunatly could not get past the second scene without the help of my friend casey. once he beat the second scene i got all the way to the monster truck arena challenge. This game is not for gamers that like easy games. This has been the first game i didnt beat in a 24 hour period. so if you think you got what it takes to beat this game and you want something to keep you entertained buy it!
5,This Game Will Need Your Skills To Drive And Do Stunt.,"Buy this game if you're smart at driving. If you don't,Rent it first or play the demo before you buy it.In this game, you and the Director are partner.The Director will speak and tell you what to do overthe radio and Your job is to do what The director toldyou to do,like: Hit boxes, E brake, Jump, Reverse,Chase. And there is other thing you have to do bypressing L1 botton, Like: Cannon Roll, Nitro Jump,Getting of The Snowmobiles, and much more.If you still don't get it, don't return it, causeyou actually could buy and use The Stuntman Strategy Guide.Is a book that can help you play well on this stuntman Game.OH! If you bored or stuck on some of the mission, why don'tyou try your stunt on the stunt arena. You must complettethe mission to get new car & new arena toy.The more mission you win, the more car & arena toy you'll get.So don't sit there! Buy this Game! And you'll know why thisgame realy need your skills. :)"
4,Very Good,"It took me 20 minutes to beat a ... 30sec. level, the first one. That is the only reason i kept playing, i got [upset] at the game. But then the more i played the better and harder (much) it got, so i played until my rental was done, buy it when the price drops. Oh yah, the best part of the game is the stunt constructer."
1,be warned....,"I got this game thinking it would up to par with GTA 3 in terms of playability. Or so I hoped, anyway. Wow--talk about a letdown...I can't even begin to tell you how frustrating this game really is. It may have an innovative plot/concept, but that doesn't make up for frustration this game induces. Stay away, far away..."
3,Bring a Friend!!!,"OK, by now you should be well aware that this game is extremely DIFFICULT!! You are given NO info on the stunts you will need to perform and inevitably you will sit there watching the ""Loading screen"" for hours at each sitting.However, persistence does pay off. Especially if you have a friend or two helping you. I find that after watching each stunt about a dozen times, a friend can jump in right when you are ready to hurl the controller thru the television. And by the time you watch him screw-up for a few minutes, you are again ready to play some more.Please do not submit yourself to the agony of playing this game alone. You will hate it, you will hate yourself, and you will hate anything associated with this game.But, as a competition amongst friends, it can really be a fun game. So, please think before you play this game. OK? Don't say that I didn't warn you.This game can be fun, but it can also drive you up a wall!"
3,Hard but fun,"I'll do Pros and Cons.Pros-Good graphics. realistic car physics. Real handleing. Neat movies. Controls are okay.Cons-I have an example. One scene your escaping from a helicopter. You go left, indangering your life only to swerve out of the way just in time. Common sense, you could have gone right and not indangered your life. Although it looks good, it's really stupid. The system should have been like this. INstead of going through set stunts, you should have to go through as many stunts as you can and get as many points as you can. Oh yeah, HOW ON EARTH CAN I WRECK AN ARMORED CAR?"
1,WORST GAME EVER,"This is the worst game ever! The graphics are awful! The whole point of the game is awful! I mean why don't you just go shoot a movie yourself! At least you won't have an annoying director stopping you everytime saying:Cut! Thats too slow! Or:Cut! ""You suck at driving!"" This game got me so frustrated I was about to throw it out the window! When I saw the commercial I wanted to play it soooo bad! But now that I've played it...I don't even want to talk about it! This game deserves to go on PS1! This is one of the worst games ever to come on PS2! Thank god I only rented it! Phew! If I bought it I would fart on it, then burn it, then throw it on an old ladys head! Don't be fooled by the ""awesome"" commercial for it! It's [bad]."
1,"Please, do not try this at home!","This game is awful. I was sickened by this game because the graphics [were bad]. This game should have been made for the PS One system. I loved ""Test Drive"" and trusting Atari, I rented this game. Do not pay attention to the commercial, this game really [is really bad]. If you want a good racing game, try ""Test Drive"" or ""Gran Turismo 3."" If you still want to spend money on it, I recommend renting it. Trust me this game will disappoint you. ""Stuntman"" just doesn't push the PS2 to the limit on graphics."
1,This Game Stinks!,"This game is so hard.If you fail something in the movie scene,you have to start over!Also,the director is always telling you to do something every five seconds!If you crash,you are likely to run out of time.When you have to go through gaps,you will probably crash into something.The second movie is impossible to beat.There are also turns every few seconds.Luckily I rented the game.If I were you,I would rent the game first."
2,Original idea but poorly executed,"This game has many flaws. The graphics for one are basically just the same as driver for psone except for some cutscenes. The controls are poor and there is no way to change them. Apparently if u r going in reverse, u cannot use the e-brake. The gameplay itself is original but it just gets monotonous with no real storyline. U can build your own stunt arena and screw around there, but that is the high point of the game. This game is basically driver with a limited amount of space and with your every move just yelled out to u. RENT THIS GAME FIRST."
4,Supreme gaming is my bag!,This game rocks the house yo! I love it and my sisters love it their boyfriends even love it. I'm a fan of Driver so this was a must have. My mommy tucks the game in with me every Tuesday and Friday. It makes me want to go out and take my mom's minivan off a ramp into a muddy ditch!
2,Good game but...,"Even though you can skip the pre-start stage footage/scenes, it's annoying and in the way when you just want to goto the start of the next stage. Also, the game has to reload to restart the same stage again. 'A Whoppin/Hollerin' feels like its the last stage which is usually the hardest. But the biggest problem with the game is that if you make the slightest mistake during a take, you have to start over again. The cars are hard to handle and hitting a pole or car that shouldnt be there is EXTREMELY frustrating. This game can make you throw the thing out the window LOL!"
1,Don't waste your time,"The game looks good, but plays like poop. If you enjoy being frustrated and angry enough to destroy your PS2, then by all means buy this absolutely irritating game now. Oh, and Test Drive stinks, too. In fact, the two games are almost identical, so don't waste your time on either one..."
2,Good idea but to hard,This game is by far the hardest one I have ever played. but I did beat the game it just took me a million times on each level to get through after ripping the game out of my ps2 several times and throwing it across the room. Buyer's beware!! this one is HARD!!!!!
4,1 Star just because it's hard?,"I don't understand why people give only 1 star to a game because it's hard. Games are meant to be a challenge. Games are also meant to be rated on graphics, control, replay value, etc. The game does need a little more replay value, but other than that the game's great! I agree completely wth the gamer from Brooklyn on this. This game shouldn't have a 3-star rating because of it's difficulty."
1,Stuntman = garbage,What a waste of my money! This boring piece of crap is getting traded in immediately! The stunts are ridiculously dull. Driver and Driver 2 are 10 times more action-packed than this farce. Avoid at all costs! Not even worth renting.
3,"Fun at first, then just plain annoying","It started out awesome, and loads of fun, a great concept of doing stunts. Unfortunately once you get to the second movie, its near impossible, and will habve you throwing the control at the screen and shouting. If you are a video game fn, check out PLaystations Magazine's in depth review about it , and you can read more and see where inm coming from. Its a fun game, but onlly if you have LOTS of patience and are willign to stare at load screens for long amounts of tinme."
4,THE best stunt game,"When I first got ps2 I thought Stuntman was the number 1 game to buy, and it is. The graphics are very realistic, and how the people act on the set is realistic too. Although, sometimes it's kind of hard comprehending what to do in stunts.After you do about 4 or 5 stunts,in the begining, it gives you a little fun stunt to do(jumping off a ramp filled with explosives in a desperate attempt to hit the top car of a pile of cars.) The one downside is the loading time is tremendous for little clips of what's gonna happen.Another good thing about this game is you get to build your own stunt park.Howver, you need to win levels to get the really good equiptment. You also get some really good cars to choose from,after you've won some levels.+PROSGood graphicsGood scenesGreat cars to choose fromStunt park creatorFun stunts-CONSLong loading timesOverall, I thought this game deserved 4 stars."
1,"BOOOOO!!!...--Good graphics, but BAD game play!!!...","... Although it has cool graphics, the game play stinks, and the controls are too much hard-to-handle!!!! ..."
3,Frustration is very strong is this game.,I mean the idea was great for this game. It was a deffenate buy for the GTAIII fans. But there was something obviously missing. It lacked in every thing that would get you going to the point where it just plain brought you down. The frustration is so intense it makes you want to cry. But if you can get past the screaming director or the countless mistakes its a pretty solid game.
3,This game is FRUSTERATING!!!,"This game is so HARD!!!! On one level you have to chase a car, but you can't keep up with him unless you hit him, and you can't do that.The cars are annoying, too. The person you're chasing never even comes close to a car, but the cars come at you. Where is the logic in that??? I've been hit by a pickup, van, and a bus. Every time they have been coming after me!!!Another problem is the camera. On another level the camera was stuck in one place and all I saw was a moving camera looking at a pile of dirt.The good thing about this is that once you get the hang of it, it's fun. The graphics are great, and some levels are fun. The rest are frusterating."
4,The Book is very good but it could have a better cover.,Love the book but I have already tore the cover a little from caring in my back pack.
5,Superior,Uses Acts and the life of Paul as a model for Biblical leadership. Far superior to most Christian leadership books.
3,Leadership in the style of the Apostle Paul,"This book gives you a history lesson on Paul and how he applied leadership in his life. While I enjoyed learning more about Paul and his leadership style, some parts of the book especially near the end became slow to read as if the author just wanted to complete the book."
1,Worst Wrestling game of all time!,"WWE: Wrestlemania X8 was the worst wrestling game I have ever played! First of all, the graphics are horrible, there is no anouncer or commentary, and the controls are slow and unresponsive, so much that you feel like you are controling senior citizens rather than wrestling superstars! If you ask me, you can definantly skip this game and play Wrestlemania X1X."
5,Looking to be the best wrestling game made so far!,"The showcase of the Immortals is coming to the Nintedo Gamecube! Wrestlemania X8 is looking to be the best wrestling game ever made. With an all new gameplay, more than 60 match types, an extencive create a superstar, and much much more, it will be a great game. The graphics look fantastic. A couple things I am very happy THQ put into this game is a full size Hell in a Cell. There will also be TLC, with this being the first game to have multiple ladders. Putting the nWo in at the last minute topped this game off. It was the cherry on the already great looking ice cream sunday.I have played alot of great wrestling games, and alot of horrible ones (cough...Raw...cough cough). This is looking to be a great game and I can't wait until it comes out."
4,A Simply Underrated Game,"When I first saw a commercial for this game it looked amazing, the graphics and gameplay looked smooth and it looked like a fun game. But when I got the game I was somewhat disappointed. The music sounded like going up an elevator not hardcore WWE wrestling. But when I got online looking for reviews, I saw that this game was majorly bombed. It was not as good as excepted but it is a great game.One of the worst things about the game was the creat-a-player options. They were limited and there weren't nearly as many moves as Nintendo 64's No Mercy.The graphics and gameplay make this game really fun to play though. It is fast paced and the moves look brillant when exeututed.If you are a die-hard fan of WWE, get this game! But if you want to see what all the fuss is about, rent it!"
5,Best game I've played,"This is probly the best GC game I've played.It has a create character option, which is one of the things that makes a game good. It has tlc (table ladder chair), hell in a cell, and a lot of other things that make it a good game.This game isn't like the N64 one, its alot better. Buy this game, it's good. ;)"
1,"Well, this will teach you to leave early reviews","Wrestlemania X8 is upon us and everyone is left with pie on their face. This game is a huge letdown, considering the hype that was built up for it. Now that is out, everyone who sang it's praises months before release day are looking stupid. Granted, the graphics and roster is good, but the sound and control leaves much to be desired. Please, next time wait until a game comes out to review it, so other people can benefit from a REAL review."
1,"danger, will robinson","If you are looking for a wrestling game that is fun and involving, don't buy this one. All of the hype about this game is wrong, as the grappling system is reduced, there is no story line, and it will take you ten years to win a belt..in summary, don't buy this product!"
5,WWE WRESTLMANIA X8,this is the best wwe game out it has over 40 match types including a full size hiac tlc cage ladder iron man match table match this is the best wrestling game ever its a mix of smackdown just bring it and no mercy and there is 42 superstars including the nature boy woo Ric Flair the nwo and some of the music is not licensed including booker t the nwo but over all its sweet i would give it a 10/10 its got match types 50 oringal belts and path of a champion mode only a few probelems with triple threat matchs and fatl four ways the ai is messed up they gang up on you like a handicapped match if you are a wwe fan BUY IT if not rent it first
2,What Happened???????,"I absolutely loved No Mercy for the N64 and thought that this game would be the same but only better graphics and sound. Boy was I wrong!!!!! The game is made by THQ (makers of No Mercy), but the controls are totally different. Wrestlers can only do four main moves from the grapple and you have to use the control stick instead of the d-pad. On top of this, the music during gameplay is absolutely terrible. I turned the music off to be less annoyed only to find that the game is practically silent when its off. The crowd barely makes a sound when you perform a good move and is ABSOLUTELY silent when you perform other moves. You get the feeling like your wrestling in an empty stadium!! THQ will hopefully get some of this feedback by game players and decide in the future to make another wrestling game with gameplay like No Mercy. All in all, this might be an okay game to rent, but its definetly no worth buying."
4,Not Bad!,"Having just purchased a Game Cube for my 6 year old, this was the first game I purchased for it, although we rented several. I agree that the background music isn't as loud as it could and should be, and there is a glitch in graphics from time to time, but overall, none of that effects the game play. My son, as well as my husband, who are both avid wrestling fans, both love this game and have spent many hours playing it and staying out of my hair. There is a wide variety of superstars to choose from, everyone from The Rock and Stone Cold down to The Hurricane and Lita. Not so easy to control at first, but then it's not supposed to be so easy or it wouldn't be a game. Takes time and practice to get all the moves right, as well as a good memory, but the more you learn the better you get."
2,"This game really [stinks], from an expert wresting gamer","I was really excited to finally be able to play as the Hurricane, a main reason I was draw to this. And since I haven't found a good enough game to stand even close to No Mercy, I hate the Smackdown series, this was even a bigger dissappointment. It's just like Smackdown, a nice button mashing game where you just frantically press buttons which takes no skills what so ever. Forget about using low tier wrestlers against the Rock, I did about 20 Eye of the Hurricanes on him and he still got up. The more then 1 on 1 wrestlers matches [stink] cause there is no way to knock out the other wrestlers long enough to get a pin. If you're a newbie gamer who just loves the Smackdown games, this is for you, I highly recommend No Mercy on N64, I would even recommend the Akklaim games, Warzone and Attitude before this game."
3,It is an o.k. game,"Alright, the good stuff is that they have good match types. They have like hell in a cell,cage,tlc,and etc.The sorriest match type is the Royal Rumble because I have had the game for almost 2 months and I have never beaten it.To me, the coolest wrestler on the game is RVD.I also wish they could have added backstage areas,too.Other than that this game is pretty cool.But,for all of you who like No Mercy on N64,I would just rent it first.P.S. The special moves are very easy to pull off!"
1,weak very weak,only get this game if it's free my friend and i both have gamecubes and we couldnt wait for this game. my friend bought it the day it came out (full price it's not worth it) it's is utter crap everything is crap about this game id have a sexchange b4 id buy this game
2,I'm Really Confused!,Its really wierd because in the game it says WWF. But in the game holder it says WWE. Why?
5,Best WWF Game so Far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It has RVD,The Hurricane, and DDP.....that's not a bad thing that's a GOOD Thing.It has the NWO.It even will have for the first time ever.........a FULL SIZED ....HELL in a Cell.Everyone will agree that it is the best WWF video game EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Waste of Cash,"I've bought many wrestling titles by THQ for the nintendo and have found them all to be great. When this game came out for the GameCube I was excited. Excitement quickly turned into disapointment. Everything that was great about the previous THQ wrestling games is missing in this. The controls are sub-par and the graphics in my opinion are not as good as the 64's. The computer AI is annoyingly cheap, reversing your best moves when you are at full momentum. Bascially this is a rental and not a good rental at that. Hopefully they'll be able to improve this title in later installments."
5,WWF(dont get the F out) Wrestlemania X8 is almost Perfect,"... And I have got a lot to say, there is no blood in X8, NO X-Pac, but Tag teams come out together, There are 50 original belts to win, and a new concept where you can win a customized belt,save it to your memory card and defend it and if someone else wins it they can save it to their memory card. There are 42 wrestlers,Nine of them Hidden, including Stone Cold,HHH,Undertaker(short hair),Kane,the nWo, RVD,DDP,Y2J,Team Xtreme,and America's favorite superhero the Hurricane...,and a whole bunch more. There can be 7 people on the screen, 4 superstars, 2 commentators, and A referee. You can fight up the stage and ramp. Some weapons can be dented. There is the first ever Full sized Hell in a Cell. And Christian even has his pyro. You can also do the 3D through the table."
2,OK?,WWE WRESTLEMANIA X8 isn't the best!The gameplay is stupid.The moves have been copied horribly into the game.I just saw the trailer and the character design is bad.You should look into buying PS2 and getting a real good wrestling game -WWE SMACKDOWN Just Bring It! Look for WWE Smackdown! Shut Your Mouth hitting stores soon.
4,This is a Great game!,"This game is one of the best games I've played. The graphics are the best Nintendo has ever seen. You will have fun either by yourself or with your friends. There are some things that could have been in there. 1. Go backstage. That was a BIG disapointment of the game. 2. Interupt during a entrance of a wrestler. 3. Have interference from the locker room. 4. Fight in the crowd. 5.Better storyline in Path of a Champion. Other then those things, this game is fun."
3,64 was better,"This game is ok. the graphics are awesome, but the controls [stink]. And so far I haven't seen a storyboard just fight after fight which [also stinks]. Like I said graphics 100, controls and gameplay 50. The controls were better on the 64."
3,Not the best wrestling game,"This game was okay. There is no backstage area, and the create a wrestler mode is very small. The move list is huge. Overall, if you just like using superstars in the ring only, this is the game for you."
1,Horrible just plain Horrible,"The year is 2002. President bush is plaining an invasion on Iraq because of threats of Nuclear weapons, America is entertained with American Idol. And the WWE just celebrated another Wrestlemania. In 2002 thq came out with this wrestling game. When I saw it I thought it was going to be one of the best wrestling games. But I was wrong. The controls are easy. But the game is bad. If your stone cold and you nail the stunner they get up right away. Just like on smackdown you can pop a finisher anytime. The Music is bad. And the story mode is god awful. If your champion you don't come out with the belt. My friends don't get Smackdown (err) I mean Wrestlemania X8 Get Day of reckoning. This game is very bad and should have never been created. Shame on you THQ For this game. Shame Shame Shame"
3,WRSTLEMANIA X8,"How does everyone know that this game is going to be so great. How do you know that there going have everything they say they will have. Raw is a good game. Not all mathes are Hell in a Cell and TLC( if you think about it there is a TLC, with the tables and chairs and ladders around the ring).Raw is very relistc. This game looks good, but don't dis other games and for that matter other systems. I'm sure if everyone had the money they would buy every sytem.The graphics chould use some work but the are ok.I am sure there will be a hordcore mathes.All in all I look forword to playing this game."
5,Stop Complaining This Game ROCKS,"I dont know what people were complaining about this game was a BIG HIT! Not This game had two things that wern't to good, Create-A-Wrestler & Carrer mode. The only thing bad about Create-A-Wrestler is creating what your wrestler looks like. They dont have a wide enough varite of faces, bodys etc. In carrer mode all you get to do is face wrestlers and you dont get to have storylines etc.The Entrances were perfect but you should of be wearing your title belt if you have one. Next Time THQ if u can correct thoes minor details the game will be PERFECT!"
5,my review,when i first bought this game it seemed stupid because there wernt very many moves but once i got the hang of it i found out it rocked because u could do moves like the angle lock without even using a speciel.
2,what happend?,"...c'mon what is this a barbie game this is wrestling!!! that alone is a turn-off, also i've read that the moves are limited, theres no run-ins the music is bad(but that i don't mind) i mean theres a bunch of flaws. This happend to me several years ago when i bought wcw mayhem it wasn't as great as revenge(wcw)and wasted money on it. So i know the feeling of thinking that you're in for a treat insted you get tricked. Just a little advise for my friends at thq... next time listen to your custumers and give them what they deserve if you know yuke {stinks} so hire AKI because it's better i mean c'mon this is a GAMECUBE 128 bits use them!!! and stop thinking that we are ignorants man!! believing that we would'nt notice the flaws HA! (these people have no idea what so ever in what they're doing)"
1,WWE WrestleMania X8???????????,"This game [is bad]. The control is hard. The entrances are very bad the sound sounds like it is from n64 and the graphics are as good as Legends of Wrestling. WWF Raw is better then this game. Well this is the best WWE game out there, only because it is the only WWE game out there."
2,Great graphics but terrible game play,"This is by far one of the best wrestling games to have unbelieveable graphics but cannot follow through with great game play. They should of keep the game engine the same as No Mercy or Wrestlemania for the 64. I have to admit , that I returned the game 5 hours after I bought it."
3,Cool Game some flaws though,"It is a cool game like its superior graphics to the x-box game Raw, its updated roster and easy control but, It doesn't have all the new stars like DDP, Maven, ect. And the stars all have very few moves, and strangely enough you can't do for the tag titles, and the nWo is well strange I'll just leave it at that.But it does have advantages like great create a player mode, the road to the championship is cool and it has guys like, RVD, Booker T, Hurricane, Flair. I'm not gonna tell you to buy it or not but it has its advantages and its disadvantages."
1,I'm waiting??? In stock... but not send??? why???,I'm waiting??? In stock... but not send??? why???The products are in stock but have spent many days waiting to be sent ... had never been so slow ... not that half-written ... could please tell me what happens? thanks
5,Electric six rocks hard,"Oh My, this band is a one of a kind rock out expirience, highly recommended. Simply amazing lyrics, blows my mind every time. Be warned, users are subject to sudden and unpredictable DANCE attacks when listening to Electric Six. You should be ready to rock at all times."
5,"Such a great, and different (in a good way) cd.","Heyyo,I love it! It's got great beats, and the lyrics are just the right amount of silly/awesome. This is definitely one of my favorite music albums of all time.. I listen to this and the rest of the Electric Six stuff nonstop at work on youtube until I can just buy the rest in one go.. darn mortgage and truck payments have to come first over my love of music sadly. :P"
4,*giggle*,Wow. Great stuff. I first heard these guys playing on the radio in London earlier this year and have been waiting for this album to be released ever since. Now that it has... well.... I'm happy with it. Worth the wait. The album is pretty much just more of the hilarious guitar based disco stuff that was on their 'Danger! High Voltage' single. Well worth the low price being asked for it. With titles like 'Dance Commander' and 'Electric Demons in Love' how could you go wrong anyway? :o)
2,"Uh, KISS isn't from Detroit, dude","Amazon.com reviewer Aidin Vaziri needs some serious rock 'n' roll schoolin'. Despite its song ""Detroit Rock City,"" KISS is from NYC, not the Motor City. Duh."
2,Buy the Makers - Rock Star God instead,"This album has character to boot...But the same soound over and over will make you insane. These guys want to be something their not...THE MAKERS! ""Rock Star God"" by the Makers is everything right, while ""Fire"" is only ""nearly-right""...Keep trying guys...You'll get there."
1,This album is pretty bad,"This album was so terrible that I had to buy it just to make fun of it. The ""fire in the disco,"" thing was just too much. It truly sounds like the lyrics of this album were created by a 4 year old, but that's besides the point. It has a hilarious disco/rap vibe to it which makes me break out in unbearable laughter. A definite must buy for someone who wants a good laugh."
4,Interesting read,"A rare view of the insiders world of independent film production. Although most indie filmmakers will never make it to this level of budget and fame in the industry, it is an incredible education to understand that world. Vachon is an engaging writer and I found this to be an enjoyable book, as well as informational."
5,Fibromyalgia Syndrome - Fighting the Devil with the Patience,"Fibromyalgia Syndrome-Fighting the Devil with the Patience of Job is one of the best books that I have ever read or purchased regarding living with chronic pain and fibromyalgia. I have the paperback version of the book and recommend it highlyThis author did her homework and has set everything out in laymen's terms so it is easy to understand and refer to time and time again. Also, she certainly does not mind ""walking on a few toes"" when talking about health care and disability issues. It is a ""must read"" for people who live in chronic pain and for those who have fibromyalgia (and especially those newly diagnosed with the disorder or think they have it)."
4,Confusion of album,I would like to find out why the album has two diferent prices. what is reissued and remastered?
2,Binding was damaged,"The pages of this book were pristine, looked unused. However, when it arrived the joint of the front cover of the book was separating (about halfway) from the bound pages. Maybe this was because it was shipped without much support (just bubble wrap in a mailer, which would be fine for a small, light weight book.) After opening it a couple of times it had completely separated making the front cover floppy. I guess the next step is that the front, spine and back will eventually just separate from the bound pages. This is a very large book, and needs some support, which it doesn't have. It's disappointing, because it was expensive for a used text."
4,Music rises above some minor flaws,"Word to the wise: skip the 5 minute introduction by John Hammond. It may be interesting to hear his litany of band members one time, but it is quite tedious to listen to every time you pop in the CD. The best point he makes is that Basie can make a big band sound like an inspired small band. Hammond introduces some of the songs too, even talking over the beginning of the music at one point. The recording quality sounds like it was recorded live in the 1950's, probably because it was.Fortunately, the music rises above all of this. I am not a jazz or big band aficionado, but I can tell this is great stuff. The band moves seamlessly in and out of solos, and they sound like they are having a great time, too. It makes me wish I could have been there to see these legends live on stage."
5,Absolutely Essential,"In rattling off a list of the great live jazz ever recorded, this Basie album would be at the top. Longer versions of some Basie standards make this reissue on CD an excellent addition to any jazz collection. It was the first Basie album I ever purchased, and it is the one that gets the most play. When I first bought it, it didn't leave my stereo for weeks."
2,"the seller did good job, quick delivery but the product itself is not so interesting for children","The seller did good job, fast delivery and good quality product. But the content of the DVD is not so interesting for kids. My children didn't watch them at all. It is bit boring for them"
3,good to begin with,"I'd say these rings do only okay. I make crumpets with them, and on the second use, one of the rings fell apart at the welded seam. Also, for crumpets, I think it is better to have a taller ring for more uniform heating. So, I am searching for a better set."
5,MUFFIN RINGS,"I make my own gluten free hamburger buns with the rings. They are a good size, and work very well. I hand wash them and dry them right away. I haven't had any trouble with them rusting."
4,They do what they're designed to do,"I bought these rings to make English Muffins and Australian Toaster Buscuits. They work as designed, of course.The one caveat is that they are not sturdy as they could be, so can bend out of round a little. Easy fix, though, to bend them back to mostly round. But then, the 'not quite round' form adds character, right? Yeah, that's it...character.Well, they still work better than the tuna cans I was using! Good for eggs, too."
2,would not buy it again,Came in box that were fine but opened up box they were all bent had to reshape them. They are made in taiwan so you get what you pay for. Better off using tuna cans
2,At least there's 4 in the box..,"I just opened my box of muffin rings that came in today and one out of the four is broken. I was planning on using them for english muffins tomorrow morning so returning them is not really something I want to do. At least I still have three that are usable, but I don't see them lasting for too long. I should have just used the upturned mason jar rings."
5,The volume of one ring is 10 table spoons,"Each ring will take 10 tablespoons to fill it up to the top.Note that these rings DID scratch my non-stick griddle surface.When these rings arrive, you should take a pair of needle nose vise grips and bend or smash the sharp corners.Then use a file of some sort to round off anything that feels like it may still scratch.I just wish I had known this earlier ...I would still buy these again and still give them a five star, but I would do a little bit of a touch on them if you have the tools and ability.A simple finger nail file may even do the trick.They are sturdy, they do work, and they are price nicely."
1,ok,"I bought two sets and after using once the circle of metal seperated and broke. They also rust,so, you have to wash by hand. I did make crumpets with those that stayed together."
2,Sticky Rings,"Regardless of how I coat these rings my batter always sticks to the inside of the rings. I've oiled, buttered, crisco'd with flour, etc. Makes no matter, yeast formula or batter - it's going to stick and make the finished product less than acceptable. I think I'll look for rings with a slick coating."
4,Good Workshop Lighting,"I've owned many workshop lights. This product is consistent with past lights with the added benefits or 1) protective grill, and 2) Brighter lights with a lower energy cost. This is definitely a workshop light and with over 1 year of use I've had no problems. Like others, one of the bulbs came broken, but it was easily replaced. I think enough of this product that after 1 year of use, I am purchasing 4 moreIf you want a workshop light, this is a good one"
2,Pass on this product and save yourself money and time,"Fixture and bulbs worked well for about six months. First, the bulbs began to sag and after a few weeks they burned out. Replacement florescent bulbs are hard to find and expensive. After replacing both bulbs, a ballast failed; unlike the bulbs, replacement ballasts are not available--the manufacturer is out of business. Shortly, thereafter, the second ballast failed. Frustrated and fed up, I replaced the Designers lamp with a cheap Home Depot shop lamp (Bulbs included) that cost less than two Designers' replacement bulbs."
1,bad quality,after about 6 months everything started going bad: bulbs and wiring. We have 4 of these and we are down to two. don't waist your money.
1,Cheap Junk!,"Avoid this work light, it's a cheap piece of junk. The internal wiring burned out in about the first hour of use. The metal housing is tin-foil thin and was warped, and both bulbs that came with it were busted."
1,Clarks Artisan Coreen Wedge are dangerous shoes,"I am writing to warn women that if they wear Clarks Artisan Coreen Wedges, they should be very careful regarding the ankle strap. It velcros down with no room for adjustment of tightness around the ankle, meaning if the ankle strap is at all loose around the ankle, the foot is not stable in the shoe. I have these shoes in tan and in black, and even though they seem to be made very well, the ankle strap is dangerous. I twisted my ankle while wearing the shoe, and ended up with a severe break of two bones (fibula and tibia) in my ankle. I feel that the shoe was the cause of my twisting my ankle because the ankle strap cannot be tightened. The velcro on the ankle strap has to fit exactly over the other side of the velcro on the shoe itself to close properly. If the ankle strap was adjustable, the shoe would be a great shoe. But beware! I had to learn the hard way."
2,unstable connection,"either the modem or my psion s5 is to blame: the connection is at its best when you are only using the email program on psion, but if you tried to use the webbrowser, the connection becomes very slow, and quite often the connection is dropped altogether before the completion of a single webpage."
1,Business Plan Headache,"The product is cumbersome, very difficult to work with. I ended up using a sample Plan and making modifications, which I could have done for a fraction of the cost. The questions don't produce answers that make it easy to create a good plan. The cut and paste feature is no help. The thought process to create a plan is not smooth. I regret making the purchase."
4,Solid Album!,"I downloaded this album over a year ago, and I never really got the chance to listen to it. Agreed with one of the listeners below, it's defiantly a sleeper album. I wound up listening to this after coming home, and I really liked it. The mood to the album is pretty cool. They mix in great sounds and vocals. This band reminds alot of The Shins, in the way that they mix in the heavier sound with the cool laid back vocals. This band is defiantly one whose done their homework on how to produce great music. It also reminds alot of the new pornographers, which is also another awesome band. If you love any of these bands then you should buy this it's a really good."
3,Contractor at work,"When I was assemlbing the light covers to the bulb holders,some of the plastic bulb covers broke. I sure wish they made these like my old ones in the Good Old USA. My olds ones are 12 years old and no problems."
5,J. Rockey,I am an electrical contractor and these are the best thing for temporary lighting on job sites. The are OSHA appoved and very easy to install. The best thing is that they are re-useable. Saves time and money. No more wasted temp wire.
5,Great Product,I have a large attic and I wanted some lighting that wouldn't break the bank and could be removed if and when I sell my house. This is a great product and fit the bill perfectly. Easy to assemble and works just as advertised and rated by others. And Amazon had the cheapest price. What could be better?
4,Statler brothers,"CD ,S of the statler brothers were great. Cases were cracked quite badly but had no effect on cd performance."
3,FATS DOMINO JUKEBOX-20 HITS,Quality lacking in some of the songs reproduced on this DVD. Reproduction from mainly records instead of studio tapes sounds like the cause but I'm no audiophile. Wouldn't buy again...
3,The Fat Man,Fats Domino is ageless and to hear his original work revokes a plethora or fantastic memories.
2,FATS Domino cd,The quality of the sound is terrible....sounds mono. I should have expected it. It was a waste of money. Russ Rogers
5,Fats Domino Jukebox: 20 Greatest Hits the Way You Originally Heard Them,Wonderful CD sounds just like the old 45's [without the scratch]If you like 50's and 60's and Fats Domino this is the one!
1,Save your money,"I like the fat man. I liked the songs on this CD. Unfortunately, they weren't kidding when they say it is ""The way you originally heard them"". The cuts are very ""tinny"", poor recordings. Save your money."
3,Good for older school agers,"I bought this for my 8 year old son for Christmas. He ablsolutely LOVES the animal and bug books in Ames collection. However, this book is a bit more complicated in the drawings as far as shading and finishing touches that didn't seem to translate well in this format.I think he may pick up something about drawing the human form through this, but right now its to complicated for him. Maybe in a few years he'll pick it up again and try some of these.Not a bad book just not my favorite in the series. I think this might be more useful to someone older who wants to create thier own clip art like drawings maybe."
5,A great learning tool.,"My compliments to Lee Ames and Creig Flessel for producing this ""DRAW 50 PEOPLE"" book. The step-by-step application to Mr. Flessel's wonderful drawings are an inspiration to the future artists in this world. Anyone wishing to improve their artistic skills (beginner or accomplished) would do well by following the examples in this book,(as well as the rest of the draw 50 series). I always say ""There's nothing like learning from the BEST""!"
1,Only for kids,"I thought this book would be a little creative. I was wrong. The book is weak for a couple of reasons: first, instead of teaching how to draw specific elements that make these characters it shows how to draw individual entries. So if your child wants to learn how to draw a viking, (s)he will only see one perspective and nothing more. No technique on how to draw the helmet, the garb etc.. Second, the book doesn't follow basic techniques to learn how to draw. In my opinion this book should be for 5 year olds in the house that are tired of coloring books. Buy a Jack Hamm book if you want to learn how to draw!"
2,STALLS A LOT: gets 1.5 stars,"Toshiba is a pretty BAD Brand: yeah, it may run and work for a few years, but might as well get up & go to the fridge or bathroom break when it stalls several times during play-- the progressive scan is lousy & getting worse; i have a black rack model(slim /low height type). And the P-scan is degrading, getting worse. You'd be better of with the cheap coby brand--(at least it worked well for 2 or 3 years) at least you know when it is dying, rather that this slow death. This lousy(!) brand is only meant for a VERY PATIENT person to buy. I cannot believe they charge so much for this crap."
1,Mine Died Too,"Worked pretty well for about 6-9 months, then just died. What's worse is that it's got a dvd trapped inside of it that I'll have to work to get out. I'll never buy anything Toshiba again, they're 0 for 2 on products I've bought from them."
1,STAY AWAY!!,I had this dvd player for 3 months and within every movie I watched it stopped and began all over again! Don't waste your money! If it was possible to give something 0 stars I would DO EXACTLY THAT!
3,GE 4-Head Hi-Fi Stereo VCR,"I was looking for a basic Hi-Fi Stereo VCR for a reasonable price and found it in the GE VG4275 model. It has all the features to make movie viewing and recording enjoyable as well as easy. (slow motion, stop action, commercial skip, VCR plus and a fast rewind). The picture quality was good and the audio crisp and clear when hooked up to a home theater receiver. One problem I encountered however was the remote did not operate my Magnavox TV even though it had a lot of programming codes to make the universal remote work for that brand. ...you can't go wrong."
4,Great addition ot our Christmas Villiage,You cannot have a Christmas Villiage without an Irish pub in it.There has to be a place for the Irish to drink and eat.Dept 56 as usual makes the best buildings for Christmas and this is one.So well detailed and perfectly painted.You almost want to go in and get a pint and a meal.
4,Good buy!,"I like this watch from the minute I saw it. It is what I expected except the band is a little tight on my wrist, but then again I have a wider wrist then most women. I am happy with my purchase and will be happier if the band loosens up a little bit with wear."
2,surprisingly dull...,"I hunted this book down through what seemed virtually every bookstore in Manhattan until I finally found it used at the Strand. Having read Reed's amazing erotic classic, The Pleasure Chateau, & seeing how much Lautremont had influenced his style in that book, I was certain that a book by Reed dealing directly with Lautremont himself would be something extraordinary. I was extremely disappointed to read this dull, minutely over-analyzed fictionalized *report* on Lautremont's not-all-that-interesting comings & goings, relationship with his father, etc. Perhaps if I hadnt had such high expectations for the book I would have liked it better, but somehow I doubt that, for I wasnt even compelled to finish it. For that reason alone, I give it two stars, figuring it would be unfair under the circumstances to give it any less...and on the chance that Reed, who I still admire greatly for The Pleasure Chateau, might have done *something* of interest, eventually, with this book."
2,Read The Original And Skip This One,"The implication here is that in this book--told from the point of view of the brilliant Isidore Ducasse, the future writer of Maldoror--Jeremy Reed will show the reader that he is quite up to the task of reproducing the mad, visionary, surreal style of the original. He isn't. What he does deliver is 144 pages of clotted prose seasoned with hints, guesses, a few facts, a few interesting tropes. Skip this book and go directly to the original, or, if you can't read French, purchase the Complete Works in the Lykiyard translation from Exact Change Publishers. The difference between this book and Maldoror is the difference between watered-down tea and the finest Cognac, no matter what J.G. Ballard says on the back cover."
4,powerplate and vibration machines are miracle workers,"i love powerplate but what i really love are whole body vibration machines. i am currently a member of a gym in los angeles that deal solely in vibration and powerplate machines and I have gotten fantasic results with minimal effort. if you live in the la area and are wanting to lose weight and get healthy get to fbe spa. if not, I definitely suggest purchasing one if you can afford it. I know that fbe sells them at their site [...], and I was told they are the cheapest retailer but I haven't done enough research. But trust me they work!"
2,It is the Gravity Boot for 2009!,What amazing promotional material! What convincing testimonials from satisfied customers! I will run right out and buy one today. Or perhaps I will save my money for a decade gym membership.
4,"Great for Mac OS X, but its in the fine print","Purchased one for an old mac running OSX. it worked great.Purchased another for another old mac, because it said it ran on this particular machine. Further down, where I didn't read, it said it required OSX. But this machine is OS9. So its a no go."
4,Worked Just Fine on My Power Mac,This PCI Card worked just fine on my Power Mac G4 dual 450 mhz. The computer and software treated it as if it was a genuine Airport Card. In fact my WiFi set up for that machine was non Apple products. My base WiFi router is a D-Link DL-524 and all played nice together. I'm in a modest two bedroom Condo with the cable modem and router up next to the TV and my computer is back in the bedroom with me. Not exactly me telling you that it works even in huge 16 room mansion but you should have no problem finding a place to hide the router and have the computer be wireless somewhere in the average home. Install of the pci card was simple plug and play.It is a little pricey but it is guaranteed to work with a Mac Computer and it does. It is one of the only ways to get802.11g performance for Power Mac G3 and G4(earlier editions) as I understand it.
5,Only way to go for older Macs,"If you have an older Mac that does not accept Airport Extreme cards the Sonnett Aria Extreme is the only way to go. [...] Easy to install and should find your wireless device in auto set up mode. If not, you'll have some trial and error experience like I did. The card works great once you figure out the ""network"" maze. Tip: make sure you drag the ""Airport"" icon to the top of the stack in the connection ports."
4,It's for a Mac; of course it works.,It was painless. Just like my Mac.The only pain will be when it goes for $25 next week. Or next month.
1,bad idea,They don't back up their products as the tech service is non existent. No one answers the phone over there. And I'm calling them locally!Beware of Sonnet stuff.
2,"Good construction, but incorrect size.","I purchased this plug because I needed something with these exact dimensions for my Arduino. My nearby Radio Parts retailer sells a similar plug, but it's 2.1 x 5.5 x 12.5mm, which is 3mm longer than what I was looking for.Unfortunately, the item I received was also 12.5mm long, which is why I'm returning it. I like the flexible sleeve; the octagonal sides look better than a circular plug; but I don't like how it sticks out when plugged in. Oh well."
1,The Force of Character,Worst book I have ever tried to read. REcommended by a professorial type friend of mine. I have spoken to him about hisfuture book recommendations.
2,He was much better before FAME and EDITORS,"I studied the early writings of Mr. Hillman, as a student in Vermont. He was once a real genius, original and gutsy if more incomprehensible. Then, some editor got him to ""make sense"" And in the Soul's Code, I suppose he did, in a pablum-ish way. But this book? I couldn't make nor head nor tails of its structure or meaning. Where o where did the gods put this man's genius? Or rather, what price was he willing to take to his great writing to render this mess? Well, because he is a great author in the past, i cannot give him one star. But for anyone else, i'd give this none."
5,Terrific reframe,"Reading Hillman always tickles my brain and this read is no exception. He puts names and values on the possible journey into age, rather than allowing our youth valuing culture to shovel our aging population into obscurity. I find his discussion of character development thought provoking indeed, but truly enjoyed, was amused by, and was mentally stimulated by the way he takes the symptoms of aging and turns them into a soulful function. If you work with aging folks or if you plan to become one yourself, you will get some excellent food for thought from Hillman's brain...as always."
