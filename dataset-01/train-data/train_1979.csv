2,Raspy Rick???,"As a die-hard Rick Springfield fan from the 80's I was eager to get this album. The songs are well done and the music is very nice, but Rick's voice sounds like he's smoked WAY too much for way too long. A little rapsy is one thing, but this album sounds like he was choking the whole time. I'm sorry I bought it and am thinking of reselling it. I couldn't even listen to the whole CD without being annoyed at the crackle of his voice. It almost doesn't even sound like him. Sorry, Rick."
2,Shock/Denial/Anger but no Acceptance!!,"I have been a Rick fan since I first heard Jessie's girl, and have loved everything he's done since (and before). Until now. After the stunning S/D/A/A, possibly his finest work, I was not expecting 14 MOR dirges like this. By the end of the track 13 I'd lost the will to live, or at the very least, the will to stay awake. His voice doesn't suit the songs, and the arrangements are unimaginitive to say the least. The only saving grace is Imagine, a hard song to do justice, but his version is quite pleasant. I never thought I'd be giving Rick a bad review, and I'm gutted."
2,"Ah NO ""SO SAD""","I have been a big fan of Rick Springfield for a long long time and its sad to see the one time rocker releasing a CD like this.The covers are boring to listen too although I do lile the cover of Broken Wings but even that track cant save this CD. The choice of songs are also very poor and most just don't suit Rick's voice, Sad Sad Sad."
3,Not Bad Not Great,"After seeing this CD & having bought it just because it was the new Rick Springfield CD & then reading reviews for his last,I wish I wouldn't have missed it.I'm disappointed that it's a cover tune filled CD,& all slow tempo.I don't think I could ever HATE Rick's music & I don't hate this but I am disappointed.Definitely no Working Class Dog 05"
2,YOU can do much better !!!,"I need to say that I'm living in Germany (not a small town somewhere in the US, but in Europe). Right now you will not get the CD here - and I must admit - it's no big deal! I was high on expectations awaiting the new CD and very excited when I held it in my hands. I'm not commenting on every song; there are some good songs - almost like the originals; but most of them you may play to your girlfriend to impress her with your guitar skills! I was positively surprised after hearing S/D/A/A. Why didn't Rick just move on this way? I hope, he releases a CD with his own songs soon! Rick keep on ROCKING!"
5,Awesome Mellow Music,"This is an album of covers from the '70s and '80s, but several of the songs were new to me, since I don't remember ever hearing them before. Rick Springfield states that his goal was to put together a ""moody-atmospheric"" album and he definitely succeeded! This is a collection of mellow songs which are perfect for easy listening and his deeper, raspier voice adds the perfect touch to the mood of the album. Definitely a keeper!"
1,Got what I paid for!,"All I wanted was a simple charger for solar light batteries. The charger never charged the batteries that came with it, nor other NiCd batteries I already had. The LED lights never turned off even though I left the batteries charging over the stated 16 hour charging time. I paid less for the product than I paid for the shipping cost. As I said, I guess I got what I paid for!!!"
3,Totally Awesome but serendipity comeon !,"I thought the book was good and I'll give it that I even read it twice, but it is a bit corny and what a sad tv show can't they do any better! Anyway I've given it three stars I would have probably given it four if Elizabeth wasn't so sad and possibly five if Jessica wasn't such a drama queen, Read it if you like corny things and you will probably like it more if you are american as it is a very americanised book."
1,Too Small To Be Able To Legibly Write Odometer Mileage,"I like the Dome Auto Mileage Log Books. Except this one. It's just too small - Can't fill in these little boxes legibly.This small log fits into a pocket nicely and you'd be able to take it anywhere with ease. It will fit into a shirt pocket, for example, and is so lightweight you wouldn't remember it's there. But it's just too small for the purpose.Dome makes good products and I realize they wanted to go smaller and lighter weight, but this is too small.I found one that is still small but just large enough to suite the purpose. It's 1.5 inches taller, a quarter of an inch wider and four times as thick as this one, yet it is small. I recommend you get this one which I also got and am using:Dome 750 Mileage Log/Expense Record, 3.5 x 6.5 Inches, Logs 324 Trips (DOM750)."
2,Fascinating nonsense.,"The book is the most fascinating example I know of the pretentious pseudo-scientist ""investigator"" who takes natural experience and ""accounts for them"" with the most-far fetched theories. Ships and airplane have accidents the world over but to Berlitz ordinary common-sense explanations are not good enough. So he ""accounts"" for these losses by speculating about visitible and invisible UFOs, sea monsters, holes in the sky leading into ""the third dimension"", and a whole lot of such absurd speculations."
3,OK,Show is alright. I don't think it is as good as the original CSI or CSI NY. I enjoy the cases though.
3,CSI,It was good I got my product right on time n it was the correct season n it was new nust like they said
4,CSI Miami,"CSI Miami still has some glaring deficiencies in story writing and dialog. Overall I rate Season 6 as 4 stars, though this may be too high. What turned out to be especially annoying was the whirlwind trip to and from Brazil; this story line could have been developed more."
5,better with each year,"I collect them because they're fun, and because I listen to them in Spanish for practice. Everyone's in fine form here, as usual. Loved them bringing back Speedle in the one episode, even if in the end he was just an ""auditory and visual hallucination"". ""Permanent Vacation"" was good, if sad; five minutes from going home and that happens. And I loved Dean Cain's guest starring role!Was disappointed that this season had only two episodes with commentary; usually there's three or four(or five)(and, why is Horatio the only one on the cover now?) And who didn't love the season-ending ""Who shot JR-esque?"" cliffhanger???? Also, love how Ryan's career is spinning slowly out of control, and continues to in S7. Great writing and acting there. Love CSI:Miami."
5,BEST SEASON TO DATE!!!,so far season six has been the best season of csi miami. similar to the plot line fron season 4 with the mali noche crime gang except this time its about horatio and his son. the ending in episode 21 is not to be missed and there is an excellent 2 part episode aswell. a must see for any fan of csi miami.
2,Stilted dialogue and wooden acting.,"Maybe I am being too harsh. Maybe I am unknowingly comparing this series to the Las Vegas series. Whatever it is, this season of CSI: Miami is missing something. The acting seems so forced and over the top (more than usual). Khandi Alexander's character has been annoying since the inception, but she is just wacked out this season. And I don't know if it's the writing, but it is as if the characters do not even listen to the dialogue of the other characters; they just kind of randomly come out with non sequiters (sp?) or something that has nothing to do with what was said before. It's as if they are all in a daze. Maybe it's always been like this and I just didn't notice, but I don't think so. What I really think is that this is a show about to 'Jump the Shark', or has done so, but we just haven't realized it yet. I guess we just need to see Horatio Caine waterski jumping a pool of sharks while adjusting the sunglasses on his face."
4,My second favorite show of the season,Season 6 is my second favorite show and this is my first time writing a review. It made 21 episode of this year same as CSI New York: Season 4 due to writers strike.
1,"Same show, different packaging style","I would have given this product 4 stars, but Paramounts decission to change the packaging style dropped it down to a mere 1.The new packaging is a thin pack, which has become the norm for most studios when releasing TV shows onto DVD. This is the second packaging change, the first one occured for Season 5, they changed from the plastic outer sleve to a cardboard one. Not sure if the interior changed, but odds are it did.The only thing I hate worse then ""double dip"" is inconsitant packaging for multi season DVD's. Fox started this trend with ""24"" when it changed from the brick size digi-packs to the thinpacks for season 5.I wouldn't be at all surprised if the packaing for season 7 is changed to one of those standard looking DVD cases that somehow hold 6 discs. Paramount must hold shares in the company that makes them, because they use them on many of their TV on DVD releaes."
1,The worst show on TV,"The writers of this show need to take some notes from the writers of CSI New York. David Carusso has to be one of the worst actors on TV, he over exaggerates everything and the cheezy one liners and his sly putting on and taking off the sunglasses are more funny than anything, he over plays every line he has on the show. The female actors on the show make it somewhat tolorable but the acting and the story lines are more funny than anything. CSI New York is so much better than this show and the story lines are much more realistic and believable."
2,Be Careful!,"Other than the one issue which I am about to tell you, I love this chair! It folds up so nicely, sleek and easy to use. But....there is a space about 1 1/2 inches between the seat and the frame of the chair, just below the tray, that my daughter gets her arm stuck in EVERY time we use it! She's a little thing but her arm gets very tightly wedged in this space and its difficult to free her! Please be careful!!! Other than this issue,which I've already brought to Graco's attention, the chair's great!"
1,My son's arm gets stuck!!,"I do NOT recommend this highchair. My son has only used it a few times, and every time he has gotten his arm stuck on the side where the top of the legs meets with the seat. It is a heartbreaking thing that my son now associates highchair/feeding time, with pain. He whimpers every time I pass it, it is pathetic. I will be returning this highchair-and try to reintroduce my little one to a different kind. I don't find the stow away model to be all it's made out to be. I will be going with a standard highchair, like my first 3 children had and enjoyed."
4,Where's the TV series?,"Well, as the first reviewer pointed out, the biographies of the stars looked like they were made for TV. Yes they were. Kevin Burns made them for A&E's BIOGRAPY series. The reason Yvonne is not in this is because she has some disagreement with something, maybe Burns himself? I don't know. The TV series needs to be released in UNCUT form and in box sets by season. Then after the DVDs are released, CDs of the great Nelson Riddle and Billy May music need to be released. Is my review helpful?--No. This just a good place to push for the release of the TV series from 1966. I mean, come on already!"
3,"COOL, BUT OVER PRICED! IT WILL HELP KEEP FANS HAPPY UNTIL THE SERIES IS RELEASED! OR WILL IT?","I don't want to bash this DVD, but it seems to me all the material on these discs should be included on the Batman TV series DVD release. Although it's not set for release at this time, I can't help , but feel this DVD has all the available footage they're allowed to use. The Batman Documentary here is interesting enough as well as each of the star's documentaries (West,Romero and Newmar), but in each Documentary when they get to the Batman years, it's the same footage! To make matters worse the bonus features on disc two, seem like they could have fit on the first disc, making the two disc set a ploy to squeeze more money from fans of the series. If you own the movie, you already have a good portion of the Batman stuff. It's cool, but I could have waited for the series with this material added as extras. Holy Bat-poop! I've been scalped again!"
4,MORE! MORE!,"A fun DVD to watch, but I was hoping for more footage of the bad guys. Contains 3 great documentaries...Cesar Romero, Adam West & Julie Newmar."
5,BATMAN -HOLY BATMANIA,"Bought for the wife, enjoys it constantly with repeated viewings. can't get enough of it ; would recommend this to anyone"
2,Not what I thougt,"I thought the DVD that I was purchasing showed some of the actual taped shows that aired on TV. I was looking for them for my grandson. A lot of interviews and the makings of Batman TV series and Movies, it was neat for an older person, but not a 4 year old. I just think the old batman for children to watch is better than the new releases. He does like the Batman Movie(old version) that I purchased."
2,confused,"We got this dvd for our boys because they love Batman.But we thought we were getting TV episodes from years ago.It turned out to be a documentary and no episodes.Very dissapointed.If what you are looking for is to find out what the actors think about making the show and that kind of stuff, this is the dvd for you.Otherwise, don't bother."
1,Don't bother,Very disappointed this was not the original series. Returned it. Should have read the description more closely. Unfortunately I sent this as a surprise gift to a young nephew who is very enthusiastic about the original series.
1,Flimsy and poor!,"Family Classics Chinese Checkers indeed!...We were so excited to receive our game... but as soon as we opened the box we found that the board is made out of FLIMSY, THIN cardboard (not in any description of the game on this website!). It had to be taped in the corners before playing to prevent it from caving in. The ""marbles"" are PLASTIC balls and they don't stay in place, because they lack the weight... I guess if the board is so flimsy one can't put real marbles on it! We are sooooo disappointed. My advice: spend the extra $$$ and get a real chinese checkers game..."
2,Buyers beware!,"This combo drive is pretty lousy in important places.First off, the DVD drive. It will freeze during movies and click and bounce around inside the player. Sometimes it will stop clicking and start back up after a minute or more, but other times it will have to be totally shut off.And secondly, the VHS player. It plays VHS movies fine except for some annoying problems. About a month after purchase the player started squeeling when fast-forwarding or rewinding. Now this might be only annoying, but it makes me question the quality of the machine considering it started one month after purchase.Overall, the only positive feature is the abilty to watch local channels and VHS tapes. That is pretty sad, because this thing should do a whole lot more."
1,bad vcr,"The vcr unit is almost hopeless when it comes to recording. When you play back, the picture keeps rolling. Adjusting the tracking helps little if at all.Annoying since the recording settings are fairly intelligent."
3,Dead remote,Machine in it's self is passable.However the remote was DOA and the seller doesn't seem to be in any hurry to replace it.JO
5,Excellent product,Easy to operate and I love the silver color and sleek design. Coordinates nicely with my silver HDTV and printer. Would highly recommend.
3,Amy Video Collection - Good and Not So Good,"This is a collection of Amy's videos from 1986 to 2004. The videos from the albums 'The Collection', 'Lead Me On', and 'Heart In Motion' are included and were superb videos during their release that got heavy rotation on VH1, MTV, etc. These are the best videos on the dvd.The videos from the album 'House Of Love' lacked in production even during their time of release and never got much rotation on VH1, MTV, etc. The video from her duet with Peter Cetera ""Next Time I Fall"" was a hit on MTV back in its day. The video for ""Simple Things"", which was never picked up by VH1 or MTV, but nicely done, is also included.Watching these videos reminded me how fast style and technology in videos can change.The (remix) tracks are on the dvd, not on an extra bonus cd.Amy's commentary, on the videos, is included.For a more timeless viewing experience, I recommend buying Amy Grant's live-in-concert dvd ""Time Again."""
4,Fun Videos,"What fun to go back and see some good music videos! I enjoyed seeing her work, although the sound was not the best, kind of muffled at times. Where have the good videos that used to be made gone?? Definitely would recommend for Amy Grant fans."
5,Buy it !,the book was good and it arrived on time. When you buy a book online you have the option to choose a new o used textbook and still prices are very good than in school store!
4,"You realize you've been lied to, don't you?","For all of you that got a little queasy during middle school history lessons, this book pinpoints the source of your nausea. By now, most of us realize the true nature of white Americans push westward from the 18th century onward. It was a cruel, intrusive robbery that stole, raped and destroyed the dynamic culture and societies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. However, little is ever discussed about the entirely different and much older paradigm of U.S. history: the push from the south to the north.Acuna examines the nature of the Spanish and Indian cultures that amalgamated and moved forward, only to collide with the U.S. expansion in the Mexican War. He also looks at the many levels of exploitation the mexican-american people have faced over the centuries and current movements to stop or reverse these practices. A fascinating book and an enlightening adventure."
1,Fuel for Hatred,"I don't understand the point of books like these, and classes that they are taught in. Most of all, why the government should support classes that use these types of books. They only promote hatred and division. I am sure that if the schools used a book about the crimes the indigenous people of Mexico committed upon each other before the Europeans came, there would be an outrage."
3,I was satisfied until I saw black spot prints on the pages.,"As I was reading this book, I stumbled on black ink spots on the pages. I thought it was me that did this, but I found more throughout the book. I suggest that they revise the book for mistakes like these, before selling them."
3,Too costly for just the front pages,I think I would have given it 4 or 5 stars if they would have given at least 10 of the detective stories mentioned on the front pages. They give just few and more over they cut them before the middle.
5,"A ""must read"" for health and fitness enthusiasts.","Chiropractic physician Scott Lewis draws upon his years of practical and professional experience to show how we can stay fit throughout our lives by setting up a fitness program that will meet our particular needs; how to burn more fat with less effort; how to create a constant and continuous motivation with a single, simple process; how to accelerate the results of our fitness program; why we should eat more to weigh less; and the seven ways to measure our fitness program results without using a scale. The Fitness Groove is ""must"" reading for anyone who has ever gone from fitness program to program, health fad to fad in frustrated discouragement."
2,Too Expensive,"The content of the DVD I am sure is good and to be fair I have not BOUGHT this item, why? because as of writing this it is $189.98 and yet to buy all four seasons separately is $132.96 ........why is there an OVER $50 difference in price?"
3,Repeat program; Titles not accurate,"The quality of the CD is just fine. However, we have seen one show repeated twice in the first season, bearing two different titles. It's like we were cheated out of a show."
4,Nice album,"I first heard about this band in BBC's John Peel's session and I bought this album the same year it was released in the UK. This band reminds me of New Zealander band, 3D's, but they have their own creativity. I have completely no information about this band and not sure whether they still exist today. If you like early days Sonic Youth, 3D's, Pavement, etc, I think it's worth checking out this album if you can still grab it - I know it's rare."
4,Now this I like...,"I didn't like Clark's Simply Grand album, but he actually sounds more relaxed and at ease doing Christmas standards, he sounds musch more creative here. This cd is actually a favorite Christmas cd of mine, if Gary keeps thsi up, I'll have to keep buying his cd's, do soem more standards buddy and throw in a bass and drummer, and jazz things u a bit, show a little more creativity so I can give ya 5 stars!"
3,Cracked Face Shield,"The helmet has performed well except for the fact that the face shield is thin plastic, has a lot of flex, and cracked on the third use. I repaired it with fiber glass bondo and it's been OK since."
4,I listen to it everyday,I bought this CD at Japanese Amazon.it sounds like mainstream J-pop(or J-rock).some of their sounds are unique.it's a mini-album.I love it.
3,A contrarian's view of New Non Fiction,"Don't get me wrong, I love Susan Werner. But my love for her and her music comes from the richness of her voice, her music, and her lyric. This CD is playful, satisfies the need we, as her fans, have for more new music from her - and clearly satisfied a need SW had for recording these pieces.It just wasn't what I expected - it lacked the depth and the previously mentioned richness of lyric.The saving song, if you will, is the final cut ""May I Suggest to You"" which I heard her perform at the LL Bean Summer Series concert last August. This is what I expect from her -"
2,Misfire from one of my favorite performers,"Susan's great especially when you see her live but this CD is by far her worst effort to date. Where are all the great songs she has been performing all these past years live go? And where did this country side of hers come from? Has she been living in Nashville? Two of the songs save this review from being a total bomb, Stationary and Shade of Grey, but the rest are dismal and something you would hear at amateur night at the Big Boots Bar. I'm not sure long time fans will like this disc. It all sounds rushed and put together by people who really didn't know Susan's music and are trying to cram her into a Martina McBride/Faith Hill kind of category. If this is the direction she wants to head in that's fine but she's leaving me and many people who love her music very disappointed. I wish I could get my money back for this CD and maybe I'll sell my copy on ebay. Better luck next time Suze!"
2,Susan leaves behind her fans,"This new CD is certainly not what you expect from Susan Werner. Most of the songs are country or even gospel sounding and even these are pretty lame by her usual brilliant standards. There are a couple good cuts on this CD like ""Stationary"" or ""Epilogue: May I suggest"" but most are truly awful. Her cover of the famous Midnight Cowboy movie song ""Everybody's Talkin'"" has to be the worst song ever recorded. What were you thinking, Susan! Susan Werner is a great artist and this release is way beneath her talent. If she wants to move in a country direction, that's OK but she will be leaving a great number of her fans behind, including me. Based on this CD, I will not buy her next one and that is sad since I own the previous four she made. I'm sorry I spent the money on this one."
4,A good read,I couldn't put this book down. I always enjoy history written from the first person perspective. I went on to read more on the history of China and south east asia.
4,Good information and tool to use for getting started with stocks,"The book is very good, it helped me create a method in buying stocks with the limited amount of money I have. Shows that you that you don't need millions in order to get profits in the stock market. CD rom and spreadsheets is a bonus too. Definitely recommend for the novice stock person who have a few thousand to invest."
5,"Feedback on the book ""The Active Trader""","Excellent book for traders of all levels. Easy to read, well written and was easy to understand. CDROM was a great bonus!I would highly recommend this book!!!"
3,A no nonsense read,"This book is REALLY easy to read! I'm new to the market, but have learned quite a bit before reading this book. In retrospect, I wish I had read this book when I was first starting out in investing. It offers a great foundation for a new investor to build upon. It covers the basics as and it also delves into other topics for a more experienced trader. I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in begining to invest as well as an experienced investor to gain some other ideas on how to trade. I don't think I would recommend this book to a seasoned investor, though. The book is perfect for somebody looking for a high level take on investing, but if you want to disect investing concepts (a low level approach) I'd suggest looking for a book geared toward technical analysis only. In other words, this book discusses technical analysis, but pleanty other books discuss technical analysis in much greater detail. Over all, this is a great book!"
4,Well Worth the Price,"I was always intimidated by the stock market until I read The Active Trader. This book breaks down what I thought was a complicated and risky process into simple and easy to understand terms. The ""Bonus CD"" is definitely a plus."
4,Nice!,"I love the idea of retractable cords/cables. I own several and this particular one is very nice and is sturdy. It's convenient to have around, especially for traveling."
2,"Good Idea, Mediocre Product","There is a learning curve to using the Ziplinq extension cord; you must pull both ends out of the enclosure with equal pressure or the cord will bind. Equal tension is even more important when feeding the cord back into the enclosure. And when your cord gets tangled up inside the enclosure (and believe me, it will) you will notice how alarmingly fragile the enclosure is.There is a spring mechanism to help rewind the cord back into the enclosure. But the locking mechanism when the cord is extended is hit or miss, especially if the cord is pulled out to it's full length. In fact, I don't think there is a any real locking mechanism at all, ZipLinq depends on friction or maybe the moon's gravitational pull to stop the cord from retracting back into the case. That sliding noise you heard last night in your hotel room? That was the Ziplinq slowly pulling your IPod off the bedside table."
1,Cord would not retract,"""Retractable Cord' would not retract right out of the box. Looked as if it is a very cheaply fabricated plastic housing. Would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,Metal Corrosion in Boats,Excellent review of the various marine metals and alloys and their application as well as theory and practice of corrosion protection!
4,"Perfect size, good quality","These were just as advertised. High quality, perfect size, but a bit pricey. I wish there was a larger package ( quantity of 50 or 100, perhaps?) with a bulk discount."
5,My new favorite writer,"I never used to like compilations of short stories, but Sherman Alexie has changed that. This is the second book I've read by him, and I'm infatuated with his writing. The Toughest Indian in the World is about Indians from all walks of life. A woman who is unhappy with her interracial marriage, a man who is madly in love with his wife, people who feel like they have to prove that they are Indian. Even though these stories are about Indian people, anybody of any race can relate to the characters in them. I would highly reccommend this book to everybody, no matter what you like to read, you will find something to relate to here."
4,Good collection,"The stories in this collection are an interesting view of what it can be like to have one foot in Indian country and the other in the white man's world. While this bunch isn't as touching as Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in the Sky, it's still well written and compelling."
2,Reddest Apple in the World,"Sherman Alexie burst onto the fiction scene with a seminole (no pun intended) anthology in The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven. That is the ONLY decent work of prose to his credit. Reservation Blues... couldn't finish it, because half wya through there was still no meat to the plot or characters. Indian Killer? Give me a break. Now this. The Toughest Indian is nothing but syrupy contemporary prose written for critics to praise, not for readers to enjoy. ""Saint Junior,"" for example, meanders through various story lines before going...nowhere (in 38 pages!). The title story was ALMOST my favorite, but the sudden twist of a homosexual encounter did not fit the story -- and certainly not the writer. Gay fiction is done best when it is honest, but this is calculated for effect. Folks, buy his first anthology, and you'll own a piece of American literary heritage. Buy this and you'll own the equivalent of the Spice Girls."
3,five of nine isn't bad,"This book was not as good as his previous works, but still a good read. Alexie takes the Indian off of the reservation and into the white world. Some of his Indian characters have ""made it"" in the white world but still seem to long for the reservation- a Duboisesque double-consciousness. stories not to miss- Saint Junior, Dear John wayne, Assimilation, Indian Country, and South by Southwest (which compile 5 of the nine stories in the book)."
1,Dissapointing,"I have enjoyed all of Mr. Alexie's books and thought the movie, Smoke Signals was great. Good enough I added it to my video library. But I was severely dissapointed with the Toughest Indian in the World. I thought the stories were hard, rude and completely uninteresting. If Mr. Alexie's thoughts were to portray today's Native American as a member of mainstream America he missed. Perhaps some are as portrayed but most are normal, hardworking, family loving, go to the movies, go out to dinner, have a bar-b-que, loving, grouchy, kind, not so kind people."
5,have bought over and over,"I have purchased this book at least 4 times now. I love it, and all of Alexie's work, so much that I keep wanting to share it with others. The stories are political, emotional, and real. As such, they provide an important and provocative perspective into modern Indian life."
2,disapointing,"I expected a story with alot more humor. Am not old but i did not like the homosexual parts of the book and am stuck on chapter, The Sin Eaters. Can't get into the mood to finish. Sorry next time I'll get the book from the library. Chee"
4,The reservation called America,"""Deep in the heart of the heart of every Indian man's heart, he believes he is Crazy Horse,"" Sherman Alexie writes in ""The Toughest Indian in the World,"" his new collection of renegade short stories. And that might mean, um, you are Custer.Or it might just mean Alexie wants you to understand the pride and rage behind these nine lyrical, rebellious, sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking stories, where Indians find themselves between worlds, between lives, and between loves.Fiction writers simulate real life, they don't really bottle it. Alexie is one of the best American writers of any color today, but not because he writes about Indians as an Indian. Rather, it's because he observes the multi-colored light of *human* existence through indigenous eyes. His prism is a valuable cultural artifact on this reservation we call America."
3,Falls short of his previous work...,"I was impressed by Alexie's previous work, particularly ""The Lone Ranger and Tonto..."" and ""Reservation Blues""; but I found myself rather disappointed with his latest work. Although there are some fine moments, this book lacks the humor and Rez-life reality that his other work possesses. Alexie may simply be avoiding over-trod ground; but the new direction he has taken is one which I do not care to follow. At times this book was a very long walk. I have used Alexie's stories from ""Lone Ranger and Tonto..."" in my high school English class, and it worked very well. Students laughed out loud and were able to recognize themselves in the stories. I would not do the same with ""The Toughest Indian..."", because those connections have been lost."
4,Scary,I met Matthew before I read the book and after I read it I was really scared to persue the friendship any longer. I carefully removed myself from his life and had nightmares. I think to go visit him after reading and knowing this is a death wish! The book was great but I was distracted by my shock about it's details. Great crime story if that's your thing.
3,Imaginative Revelations,"While I enjoy Niven's imagination, I didn't feel like I got enough of it in The Smoke Ring. The story left everything incomplete- don't expect to feel like you have a handle on the story arc when you're finished. I found myself repeatedly skimming sections that talked about everyday life, but in a rather bland way. There was no real emotional depth here, and no well-developed characterization. The characters don't grow, or surprise you. What you expect is what you get.Yet still I recommend this book, because of the imagination of Niven. True, it only peeks out from time to time here, but those are bold peaks. Niven has an intriguing use of science which he applies to novel situations. He slowly builds more of the possibilities of what it is like to live in the smoke ring. I just wish he'd built that up more- or at least given us a sequel sometime in the last two decades."
3,Necessary yet drier sequel to Integral Trees,"Smoke Ring is a must read for anyone who has already read Integral Trees because in the Smoke Ring book Niven expounds upon the physics, layout and fauna of the system. It's a thrilling ride through the huge trees, bubble ponds and the edible varieties of brush. The same State 'government' is still an issue, as it was in Integral Trees and the other State book named World Out of Time. A post Integral Trees book needed to be written, so this is the sequel. While the plot does flow from the first book, the entire plot feels drier than the original. Character locale is disjointed, hard to follow who is where at the given time. The ending fizzled rather than banged and had some wide open ends... with no sequel in print (how frustrating is that?). There HAD been a book in the works by Niven (years ago) by the title The Ghost Ships. Looks like the story definitely dries out with Smoke Ring. Enjoy the world provided because it only exists in those two books."
3,Ringworld Continues,"This is another book in the author's Ringworld series. As with the other books it is very helpful if the reader has at least some understanding of astronomy, physics, chemistry and biology as the author refers to various terms and situations that are scientific in nature without any real explanation of what it means. It is not intended to be a stand alone book. One needs to read the previous ones in the series before reading this one or the reader will be challenged to adequately follow the plot."
5,Good book,"This is one of the books that I read when I was young, I recently tried to get them again, I wish I had started here, I would've had the books a long time ago and without having to go from bookstore to bookstore."
1,The Dope Ring,"When I read The Integral Trees I thought that Larry Niven must have been replaced by a pod person. Nonetheless, I bought and read this book hoping that that may have been an abberation. Incredibly, I was wrong. This book, a sequel to a bad book was even worse. Maybe he should give up on science fiction and start writing textbooks."
3,Disappointing,"I loved Dorothy Clark'sJoy For Mourning (Steeple Hill), but this was a disappointment. It was just not as good as her later books. There is very little depth and you can tell it is a serial Christian romance. If you want a light beach read, I'd recommend this, but not for much else."
1,Hoe Bride,"When I was looking for a good woman, the first group I check out was the local prostitutes. Strangely enough, I could not find a wife. But I got a heck of an itch. So this book is about a teenage prostitute who falls for and is saved by a preacher ... all on the next Jerry Springer. Good thing he isn't a Catholic priest or the situation would be hopeless. So Hosea, with all the wonderful possibilities around him, picks Angela for a bride? If you like this fantasy, I would also suggest ""Angela in Wonderland"". Can somebody please right a good romance novel, I am cold, sick, and lonely!"
3,Remarks On Quality,I Have Already Bought One Of These Hoops And Was Disappointed Beacase The Hoop Came Apart At Where The Nails Were Attached And There Dosent Seem To Be An Easy Way To Re Attach Them So Im Going To Try To Remove The Nails And Put In A Couple Of Screws That Way It Will Be A Litte Stronger. Hopefully... i Bought A Repacement Made Out Of A Strong Plastic Just Not As Big Unfortunatly .
1,This product used to be GREAT,"I loved cheesy hashbrowns until sometime last year, when they redid the recipe...now the potatoes never seem to get fully cooked, the sauce tastes disgusting, and the whole thing sucks.I miss the old stuff to the point that I have actually looked to trade or buy packages of the older style, to no avail :-("
1,nasty,"nasty, disgusting and gross. wasnt worth my package of beef for this one. i usually love hamburger helper and was very surprised how awful this was. the cheese topping you mix and add to the top did me in. horrible taste and the entire thing was very salty...not sure if it was from the cheese or adding my own seasonings. i scraped off what i could of the cheese and made eggs the next morning with the leftover hashbrowns, which wasnt bad but very salty."
1,NOT GOOD,I ORDERED THIS BECAUSE IT SAID IT WAS MADE WITH REAL IDAHO POTATOES. WHEN I GOT THEM THE BOX READ REAL POTATOES WHICH IS NOT WHAT I WANTED. THESE WERE TERRIBLE.
5,AWESOME-AWESOME,Just purchased this for my 7 year old son that has cerebral palsey- He only has use of his right hand- this cartridge is perfect- game does not allow mistakes and can play this cartridge with only one hand and not both. Since my son has use of only one hand he has trouble playing the other vsmile games- he's hooked. Is very engaging also where some of the other games fall short.
5,v-smile dora es excellente,"My son neo (4 1/2) got this game yesterday we opened it and he played all the way throught the learning adventure with out stopping. The controls for this game seem alittle more responsive than the older games. Dora speaks in both english and spanish: colors, numbers, and animals. If you are going to get another smartridge this is the one to get."
2,Read Description - NO Purple Pocket... a bit flimsy & cheap,"My bad on not reading the colors in the description that do not include the PURPLE pocket seen in the picture (which is why I bought this item)... that being said, I realize there are benefits of using cheap, flimsy pockets such as having less bulk & being lighter to carry around... however, after several brands & varieties of pocket dividers (many of which are Avery) these are near the top of my list of items I won't reorder. They were SO inexpensive though that I will not take the time & energy to return them... Two of them are very CLOUDY in appearance... they seem extra wide so will use them in the back of binders to hold a handful of forms for easier access for now. Avery and Others make some wonderful products that I would recommend but I do not recommend these."
5,Binder pockets,Needed these for a new job. I should have bought more. Great value for the money. Much easier to get into that a plastic sleve.
4,"From a Grad student, pretty neat.",I am a PhD student and have the need to compile all the important papers properly. This was a great tool.Pro's: Amazon as always shipped this item quickly and well packaged.Con's: Most of the binders are great but some of them 1 or 2 in 10) feel flimsy and might come off if I pull them swiftly.Great value for the money.
5,The American Master at Work!,"Bradbury is one of the greatest writers of our generation, and almost everyting he writes shows this. Death Has Lost its Charm for Me is no exception, the only difference being that instead of a collection of stories, it is one extravagent tale, filled with joy and sorrow. Buy this book now! Peace."
4,"Smells pleasant, good for dry skin","We've used ""Tub O' Butter"" for years. Nothing else works as well for dry skin and chapped lips. I do wonder if they changed the formula though. I think it's a bit lighter and less goopy than it used to be, but my husband doesn't notice a difference."
4,Red Fox cocoa butter,This stuff is wonderful! I needed a moisturizer that worked on my hard dry skin. And the best thing about it is you only need to use a small amount to get the job done.
5,The Perfect How-To For the Makeup Challenged!!!,"I first saw this video at sixteen and it really helped me learn how to do my makeup. It is the perfect gift for anybody who doesn't know how to apply makeup or just wants to update their look. I really hope she makes a new, nineties version, but the first video is still hip and gives timeless makeup advice! Go Donna!!"
4,Great for educational purposes,"Although alittle outdated, this video is great for educational purposes. I am a Cosmetology Insructor and actually use this video during our segment in facial makeup and applications. I still know people who wear their makeup in the same basic manner. As the years go by, people tend to adapt their own technique. So for basic steps and procedure, I have found that this video is very useful in my classes."
3,OUTDATED 1980s OVER THE TOP MAKEUP,"The instructions for makeup application in this video are so outdated (it's over 12 years old). I bought it back in 1992 and it looked dated even then. I passed it on to my teenage niece who just adores Donna Mills. I can't believe that this is still being sold. I guess that ""Knots Landing"" over the top 1980s look is still popular! Some of the segments at the beginning of the video are quite silly and laughable (the cucumber scene and the fake face washing scene, and the scene where Miss Mills wrapped in a towel claims to not be wearing makeup)! And all that blue eye shadow and concealer - for daytime? Please!! The only part that may still be relevant today is the natural makeup in the first segment (this is the only reason I gave it 3 stars)."
1,Don't even consider it!,"Don't be fooled by the appearance of this pad. It is useless.I have owned two Thermarest camp pads for more than ten years. They still work perfectly. I was travelling, needed a pad, and this was the only one carried in the local store. I purchased the Coleman pad and couldn't believe it when I added a little air - and it started to balloon. I was sure I had a defective pad - until I researched it further.Buy something else - like a Thermarest or an ALPS."
1,this will make it ez to justify spending money on some thing else,"This mat is horrid. It will not stop you from hurting in the morning!!!If your wife wont let you spend money on a ""good"" sleeping pad. Just let her use it for a night."
2,coleman self inflating mat,shouldn't have bought this. hardly inflates at all and very hard to return. need all sorts of authorization numbers which i still haven't received. very sad.
3,Sleeping mat review,"I think it would be a pretty good mat to sleep on if I ever received mine.Watch out for your provider, the one I used did not send mine out to me, but was kind enough to refund my purchase.Kind of defeated the purpose..."
5,If you like Lackey you will love Gladney.,"A wonderful tale of war and friendship. The main character, Naga Teot, is full of strengths and weaknesses and quickly becomes very important to you."
4,Warm heart; Cold actions lead to a sensational hero,I just found the two books and enjoyed reading them. I think the next 2 books sould be from Drin's point of view as Sati becomes his Liege in the Upai way of life. Please hurry to produce more!!!!
3,Cheap and easy to use,Overall a good buy though the blanks are a little small to write in and I wish it had a page marker.
4,good for what I needed,The price was right and it has lots of pages. I wish it had a separate place for gas but that is OK. i would buy another.
3,Not that great in any way,"It's small, sort of flimsy, but I guess if you don't want to make your own mileage log it's ok. It's just nothing special."
5,Great Auto Mileage Log,"I was glad to be able to purchase this item from Amazon.com as my local office supply stores no longer carry it. The Dome(R) Auto Mileage Log and Expense Record has the perfect format that I need to keep up with my mileage. The two-page weekly layout in a pocket-size format allows me ample room to write the date, beginning and ending mileage on one side and on the opposite page, it allows me space to write down exactly where I traveled in detail. Writing lines are spaced spaciously tall enough to easily pen the information between the lines. Thanks for selling an item I use every day."
5,Dome 750 Mileage Log,Have used this logbook for over 10 years. It is very simple to use plus the IRS requires that you have proof of your travels if you are reimbursed for mileage. I would highly recommend this product.
4,Learn to Knit Afgan Book by Barbara Walker,I am a beginner knitter and am self taught with no former classes to assist me. I bought Barbara Walker's book to learn different patterns. I loved making the different blocks and learning new techniques. The instruction are easy to follow. I have thus made 27 of the blocks and will continue to do more. I am putting a crochet edge on all the blocks. I am now working on the bobble block with a leaf pattern knitted after the bobble. I find it exciting to complete a new pattern and am planning on doing the cables next.
4,Great All-Around Knitting Book,"An excellent book for the beginning knitter or the experienced who wants to showcase their talents. I already knew how to knit basically, but wanted to improve and learn new skills. A knitting teacher recommended this book and it was a great idea!"
2,Not so Fast on the Raves,"I bought this book based on all the rave reviews, and I was quite disappointed. Now, it's very possible that I'm at fault for that -- I thought this was going to be a book that taught you how to knit afghans, and that would have multiple patterns. It isn't. It's a book that teaches you numerous knitting stitches, and in the end, you put together all of the squares you've done, and voila, you've got an afghan made up of all those squares. I realize now that that's the picture on the cover, but I didn't realize it when I bought the book. Frankly, I learned a lot about all the stitches from ""Teach Yourself Visually - Knitting,"" so I didn't NEED this book for that. However, if you understand what this book really is, then I'd say it's worth considering. But I still think you're better off with the Visual book (because everything is in color and is much easier to follow), and possibly getting another book about afghans. Caveat emptor!"
3,Be aware before buying,I read many of the glowing reviews of this book and was looking forward to learning the new skills in the description of the book. I wish I had known before buying that all the skills are taught using the Continental knitting style. The author notes that it won't make a difference to a new knitter and it's beneficial for an advanced knitter to learn this style.I consider myself an advanced beginner and it does make a difference to me whether techniques are taught American or Continental style. At some point I would like to learn Continental knitting but right now I'm just beginning to master skills in American style and I find it too confusing to switch.If you are an absolute beginner or an intermediate knitter this book may be for you. I suspect that some at my level may want to wait before trying this book.
4,Learn to Knit Afghan Book,"First let me say that I really like Barbara Walker's books. They are books for the thinking knitter. I agree with the previous reviews that if you go through the book, you will actually learn to knit and/or improve your knitting skills. I feel that I've already improved, after just four squares. This book has broaden my horizons in knitting.I would recommend it to anyone interested in improving their knitting expertise or someone who wants to learn to knit."
5,wonderful way to improve knitting skills,"I'm enjoying working the squares, because they are so portable with instructions that are easy to follow. I am very glad I made this purchase, because learning these skills will allow me to knit those sweaters I'm dreaming of. Here's a tip: Wooden needles don't show up on the xray of airport security, so I was able to knit on the plane from LA to Orlando. Great way to pass the time."
2,"Boring, with a Totally Unconvincing Romance","This book started out well, but soon I found myself skimming large sections, which I never do unless I am REALLY bored. I enjoy family interaction in a romance, but this book actually had TOO much of a good thing. The romance came out of left field; no buildup at all. But there's no rapport, no sizzle, no nothing between our h/h. And the romance was so brief, this book can NOT, in all honesty, even be called a romance. I had read two previous titles by Mona Gedney that I had thoroughly enjoyed, which made my disappointment with this one even more frustrating."
2,It was not adequately specified,It said is a Cinnamos Gum and when qe received it it was Cinnamint. I was looking for only Cinnamon Gum.
2,Sheets are too thin.,"I do like tke top loading style, but these sheets are so thin, they are not that great. I had to staple the tops of each sheet just to keep the documents in. I would not recomend to anyone."
4,OK,"They work, are a bit thinner than the economy staples page protectors, but are fine for use for protecting recipes in my binders."
1,Disappointed Customer,"I was very disappointed with the quality when I bought these. It says they fit 8.5-x-11-inch sheets of paper. My paper is 8.5-x-11-inch and it sticks out the top by a quarter of an inch. A few of the sheet protectors didn't even have the top open, so the paper wouldn't go in.I ended up going to Staples and buying the Staples store brand, which are much better! :D"
3,Be carful...,"I didn't buy this product, however I was looking for soem page protectors for my knitting book, and thought this was the best ""bang for my buck""... however I was browsing the walmart office supply section and found a pack of 50 page protectors for about 3.50...so you do the math and tell me what you think...just saying you might want to price compare and visit the local store in your area the you know gives you the best deals before buying this and having to pay for shipping... Cheers!!!"
4,"A Little Thick, But Good for Travel","I travel a lot internationally and needing something with dual timezones. This looked like it would do the trick, and I thought it was stylish.I like the watch overall, and I like the fact it has a leather band - I don't have to worry about setting off airport metal detectors. My one complaint is that it is a little thicker than I usually like my watches, but for about $100 you really can't complain."
3,Too much Lazytown..a trying parent,"I brought the Nick Jr dvd that showed 1 episode of Lazytown and my 2 y/o daughter fell in love. She asks me to play almost every morning so of course I would buy a full dvd of Lazytown. Well, she watched it once but now she cries as soon as I mention it. I'm not sure what happened but I must of overdosed her on Lazytown. I'm hoping as she gets older, she will start to like it more."
1,old stock,These batteries are old stock and have lost their charge retaining capacity. I bought three and all of them could only power my telephone for a week when no calls were made or received.
1,"Not Good, Coleman, Not At All!","I bought this as an afterthought -- as in, ""Oh yeah, I need one of those too! Almost forgot"".Since it was a fast purchase, I didn't research, figuring Coleman to be good regardless. WRONG!1. Not self-inflating as I think of self-inflating. There is a thin foam pad that compresses when the mat is rolled up, and it expands again, letting in a bit of air, when the valve is open.2. It is ALSO self-DEflating! I learned this while camping. There are no holes in it; I figure the valve must be faulty. I woke up with only that thin foam insert between me and the ground. My body weight forced the air out.3. The pillow is good. I like the pillow.I would not recommend this to even an enemy. I'm going to a closed-cell foam pad, and if I can find the receipt, it's definitely going back.I'm very unhappy with Coleman.Josh"
1,Unbelievably bad,"Thought I would save a few bucks over REI for a sleeping pad - don't do it! Number one, it didn't self-inflate at all. Number two, it was twisted so that the bottom of the pad sits at a 45 degree angle from the top of the pad. Number three, when you inflate it, it's super-puffy, like a pool toy. Number four, it's incredibly uncomfortable, with giant pits all over it - and I'm not picky!I can't believe Coleman is willing to put their name on this garbage. Take my word, it is suck-worthy. You'll just end up returning it."
2,Aaaah! Turn it down!,"This is about as high-energy as albums come; the rapid-fire approach is too much to handle. The only impression left on me is by their cover of the theme song from ""Scooby Doo,"" which is done flatly, riding on novelty alone."
2,science? religion? creationism?,"This video has the feel of Discovery Channel but by the end they are making more and more bible references. This is, to a large extent, an argument that dinosaurs may have been wiped out in ""noah's flood"" and evolution may not be as sturdy science as we may have believed.It is not bad quality but some of the stuff that appears to be straight science may get logged in your mind with stuff you learn from Discovery Channel and you might start talking in scientific company about discoveries of dino-tracks together with human tracks. This looks like science but will remind you of hunts for big-foot and proofs of the bible (which this attempts to be).The greatest value here is showing my son an example of when he should be skeptical of everything he reads and sees. 2 stars instead of 1 due to this unexpected benefit."
1,Not what it pretends to be!!!,"Buyers thinking that this is a lesson in natural history and evolution for their kids need to be aware that this video puts forward alternative theories to evolution, linking events in the geological record to Biblical events. While the word ""creationist"" is never uttered, some supposedly legitimate theories are proposed alongside well established ones. Some of these I have never heard of in all of my years of undergraduate, medical, and postgraduate education in the sciences, and yet they are presented as well accepted alternative hypotheses to the extinction of the dinosaur. I believe the title and packaging are misleading, and there is a lapse in truth in advertising. Amazon should post a disclaimer, IMHO."
1,Jesus loves me. . .,"This disc is sold as a science based program. It is simply a FRAUD, filled with bible based BS. It should be labeled as ""creation science,""intelligent design"" or simply as ""sunday school lesson for sixth graders."
4,"Easy to Read, Insightfull Book about the Science of Cooking","My wife and I have been working out and eating better to shape up and life a healthier life.With this, I've been studying food and cooking, and was drawn to this book.It's a fun, quick read, shedding light on the products we cook and cook with. Its insights have already affected the way I cook and prepare food. It's breezy conversation tone and clear cut facts make the book fun and addictive. I'll be buying the follow-up and the author's other books in the near future, and have shared this one with friends and family."
4,Useful for the novice and not-so-novice home chefs,Useful for those who enjoys cooking and wants to venture beyond simply following a recipe. The science behind cooking is explained in a simple manner for anyone with or without prior knowledge in food science.
2,"Good ingredients, terrible presentation","I have a long-standing interest in nutrition and food science, so this book and others like it hold great appeal to me. Unfortunately Wolke wrote this book with an annoying and patronizing style which I just couldn't stand after the 150 pages. I hung in there as long as I could because I appreciated the raw content, but after the umpteenth time of having some tidbit of information preceded by a volume of attempted cleverness, cuteness and forewarning, I gave up."
5,What every cook needs to know,There's more to cooking then just following a recipe. Knowing the why's and wherefore's are a definite help especially if you are going to be creative yet alone effective. This book is a great strat. I'd recommend it for any fledgling gourmet. I've recently purchased the sequel to this and hope to get to it ASAP.
1,You can do Better,"If you're interested in kitchen science, chances are you're not stupid, so why buy a book that treats you as if you were?The Q&A format means the book can't fully develop a satisfactory explanation; it also reads like a collection of magazine columns. Any explanation that sounds even vaguely technical is covered in as few words as possible, sequestered in parentheses and prefaced with the irritating word ""techspeak"". This does nothing for the book's already patronizing air.If you're a thinking cook who has taken High School chemistry, you'll be better off with Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking, an acessible classic that is used as a textbook at the Culinary Institute of America--a distinction this book will never claim.This book will serve admirably as an introduction to food science--for your nearest reasonably bright 7th grader."
3,There are better not bad for beginners,"Not bad, easy read, but if you are really interested in this stuff there are may better kitchen science books that leave this in the dust. It depends on your level of interest and sophistication. I have no idea why he through some his wifes recipes in. His other books are better.(try ""On food and Cooking"" by McGee if you want more)"
3,The not-so-mysterious mysteries of the kitchen...,"I was hoping this book would be better than it was. I anticipated curious kitchen trivia that would astonish and befuddle, I found commonplace definitions and run-the-mill advice. This book has nice solid information but it is nothing that will knock the socks of any self-respecting well-read foodie. If you cook a lot you'll likely know all the scintilating explanations Wolke has to share with you. The book is well written but aiming for a lower level of audience than I expected. A good gift for a very new foodie who has just discovered the culinary craft."
4,Very interesting stuff,"I really enjoyed this book, it does not have a whole lot of recipies if that's what you are looking for but it has a whole wealth of questions you may have always wondered or never even realized you didn't understand. It's a very easy read and is something you can pick up and read a few pages as you have time then put right back down when something else demands your attention. I recommend this for anyone interested in furthering there knowledge of cooking from a more understanding type of thinking, fans of Good Eats will really like this book."
5,Great Book !,"If you like food and science,you'll love this book.Informative, easy to understand, and humorous. I hopethe author writes a 2nd volume. (Hint!)"
4,Wolke in Good Form,"This is informative as well as enjoyable. There's less corny humor than in previous books. I cannot agree with the reviewer who panned Wolke in favor of Alton Brown; to my taste, Wolke's preferable."
5,So Interesting,"I am not a fan of chemistry, but this was a good and fun read. It wasn't hard at all and anyone can read it. I'll be trying a few of the recipes soon as well."
5,Fantastic,"Funny, interesting and a wealth of knowledge... I would have enjoyed chemistry so much more if it was taught by Robert Wolke!"
3,What Mr. Wizard asked his cook.,"I might have liked this book better if I read it before I readOn Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchenby Harold McGee. But I read that one first and enjoyed the technical explanations. Some of the same questions are explored in both books, and in McGee's book you will get a detailed explanation suitable for a college student. This book you will get an explanation suitable for about 7th grade. It's more like Mr. Wizard or Bill Nye asked these questions instead of Einstein. If you want easier reading and simple answers, this book is for you. But I felt it was dumbed down compared to McGee's book."
2,Interesting and annoying,"There were some interesting tidbits in this book, but nothing you couldn't find online if you're really wondering. It doesn't have an interesting narrative, and the author is way too pleased with himself for the book to be very entertaining. Maybe worth a bargain read, or borrow from a friend but don't pay even half price for this fluff."
3,What Einstein Told His Cook: Kitchen Science Explained,This book has interesting information about the oddities of cooking but not the basic science of everyday foods. I was a little disappointed. I was looking for the answers for why dishes didn't work out technically and this book couldn't answer those questions.
2,"Interesting, but totally pedestrian and unprofessional","This book is a great idea poorly executed. If you have a college education and a sense of humor that transcends pop culture, I suggest you look elsewhere for good reading. The book is written in the all-too-common short-section format, popular with the attention-span impaired, and the ideas are wedged between Wolke's loquacious commentary (which, by the way, teaches you nothing). However, there are some interesting tidbits, if you are willing to mine a ton of ore to get the ounce of gold. Furthermore, although the author is clearly not condescending, he is informal to a fault, leaving the reader with rhetorical questions where there should be answers-raising the question: was this book even edited? Take more than a cursory look in the bookstore before paying the exorbitant price for this pedestrian work, and, if you have curiosities about science and food, look to Alton Brown of ""Good Eats"" fame-he gets it right where Wolke just gets clueless."
3,Great Information,This book is writting in a such a way that you can read it will leisure. The information gives you a very basic understanding of what happens in a kitchen and why. it's not McGee and doesn't pretend to be.
2,Not that interesting and nothing to do with Einstien,"I usually wait until I have finished a book before I say anything about it. I am halfway through and don't think I'll finish it.I was lulled into buying this book by the title. What could be more enlightening than Albert writing about food? Unfortunately this book has nothing, and I mean nothing to do with Einstein. The book has a nice folksy tone and is easy to read but if you are a foodie at all you will know practically everything in it. As opposed to its title it is very basic. The author and I disagree quite a bit philosophically about food but I don't knock him for it, I just disagree. ""Simply put if you don't know much about food this book is an easy read but if you know what brining is, why not to put a thermometer near a bone in a roast, etc. then this book is not for you. If you want to go deeper then get 'On Food and Cooking' by Andrew McGee."
5,The absoloute best.,"This is the book I had over 35 years ago that taught me about tropicals and how to breed them. I replaced the one I lent out many years ago that moved to florida on me. I was 24 then, now I am 62 and still love my fish."
1,Insulting,"Of all the copywriting books I have used for reference, this has to be the most ineffective. A thoroughly useless text. Invent your own ""phrases"" and sound smart, not predictable."
4,Great Copy-Writing Resource,This book is a great copy-writing resource because it provides a comprehensive thesaurus of phrases that fits various client objectives.A copy-writers lifesaver!
5,excellent investment even for the seasoned rep,"Of all the sells books I've invested in this one was for me the best of all, I highly recommend."
5,Amazing..... this book is awesome,"This book is meant for anyone who loves to write. It gives you food for thought, ideas,phrases, words, slogans.. name it and you've got it. This is definitely a must have and thanks Edward and Sally!"

2,Phrases that Sell - Didn't Inspire,"A little disappointed with this one; the book has very general categories and alot of the solgans are replicated not only between different genres but also WITHIN the came category.I will refer to it from time to time I am sure, but it is not going to be the oft referred to 'silver bullet' for slogan writing that I was hoping for !! I was hoping to use it for ideas for clever play on words, and short snappy humurous slogan writing.Sadly, this is not that book !"
4,Bush and scratch,"I saw this one on tv.! Perfect! Brushing Moffit is hard, because she came from the streets, and even tho' she loves to be rubbed, she doesn't like to be handled much, so this works, and makes sense! Cats love to rub and scratch."
2,My cats are afraid of this brush,"I bought it because the description sounded really good. I have corner brushes in my house and cats love them, so I figured they would like this brush. Unfortunately, the bristles are very sharp and they are just scared of it and don't want to go near it no matter what I tried."
5,Feline Fantasy Brush,"I had one of these brushes for a previous cat. I gave it away when my cat died. I had no luck (pet stores, Walmart,etc)trying to get one for my present cat. I discovered it on line in a couple of places but their shipping charges were so high that I wouldn't consider buying from them. I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon. It was delivered quickly and just as featured. My cat hasn't used it much yet, but I'm sure as he gets used to it he'll enjoy it just as much as my other cat did."
3,No Fantasy for Boo Boo,"The Feline Fantasy Brush is a great product. When I first saw it I thought that it would be the best option for my senior cat Taboo to groom herself. She has always fought me clipping her nails, but she didnt need brushing until she got sick and wasnt able to wash herself. So the brushing is an ordeal and I didnt want to keep buying brushes just to find one she likes. This product is perfect, or so I thought. In the month its been here I have only seen her scratch on the base twice. I try to coax her to rub on or walk through the brush, what I call a giant pipe cleaner. She seems the least bit interested! I thought that there was cat nip inside the base but it doesnt seem to make a difference to Miss Taboo. I have put it in 3 different places in the house, to no avail. Where it is now is her favorite toy spot, so I'm hoping this will pique her interest. As all cats, Taboo is very picky but she seems to take it to another level! Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
3,okay,Carpet was falling off the base. Brush was really hard to push all the way into the base. I glued the carpet down again and now my cat won't use it. Maybe the smell? Great idea if it arrived in the appropriate condition.
4,we have one finally that loved this !!!,"I bought this years ago at WM I think it was and our cats at the time ignored it. We got a young cat this summer and well, this one LOVES this thing. She is a ""rubber"" by nature so rubbing her head and neck on this is second nature to her now. She has now made this purchase worthwhile but it did take years of sitting around collecting dust to get to this stage.Edit: Well our old lady cat is now using it - this was sitting around not in use for years and now the cats both like it."
3,They Aren't Interested in it Yet,"I was pretty excited when one of my cats quickly inspected the feline fantasy brush after I set it up. Her interest was very short lived; I've had the feline fantasy brush for about 3 weeks and the cats have paid almost no attention to it. I gave this product 3 stars because of my cat's lack of interest in it.I thought that the cats would enjoy the feline brush because both of them come running when I wiggle their grooming brush at them. One of my cats also likes to scratch her chin on the soles of my shoes while I have them on; I thought she would take to the product for sure.I haven't given up yet, I think that once I show Wheezy how to scratch her head on the feline brush she will take to it. I won't count on T to take to the brush because he is not a normal cat to begin with."
1,Cheaply made...awuful...,"I purchase a LOT from amazon.com, and this is the first product I have been truly disappointed with. The item arrived unused (1 star), but the glue on the base was old and the carpeting was unwrapping, and would not stay affixed to the bottom of the base - making it sit lopsided on the floor. For the price, they could have at least stapled the carpeting to the base - good grief! Secondly, the brush ends would not mount properly into the base, regardless of how much pressure was applied. VERY DISAPPOINTED in this product - a complete waste of money! For a new item, this condition is simply unacceptable. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!"
3,ehhh...it's alright.,"My sheltie seems to like it, maybe too much. He will lick it off his paws so I have to reapply it many times and monitor him so he doesn't ingest any. However, I applied many times for a month and his skin is still dry and cracked on his feet and we baby him. I would think this balm would help but there have been no changes at all."
5,Shower Capture,"I use this slate to capture ideas in the shower and it works well. The only consideration for you might be size. 8x10 is a bit on the large size, but is working well for me now that I have it.Tips for using a dive slate for Shower Capture- Pencils - You can use any pencil with the dive board. Some lead types might work better than others.- Cleaning - Clean your board with a Mr. Clean magic eraser (no fancy board cleaner required)- Writing - Don't press down too hard when writing as you will dent your board. You will quickly master the soft writing touch required.Good luck capturing all those amazing shower ideas!"
1,Cheap,"After looking for a multi purpose underwater writing tool I bought this one and am so disappointed. Very cheaply made, I cannot find any value in this tool."
3,FOR ROCK LOVERS,"Amazon have listed the song titles incorrectly so don't go by that. Judge the disc by this review. It is rock. No more, no less. It's a thick, muddy crunch of a record. Very cool. This is not a pop record. Don't get me wrong. I love pop but this disc is some other beast. It requires multiple listens from beginning to end. It's short so that's easy. The first, second and final tunes and best. As a matter of fact, i like to crank the final tune to ear splitting levels while on repeat to get the full effect. You may be asking yourself why only 3 stars? Because that is what it Ranks relative to their other output. The disc is a little work but a lotta worth it. Like i've said before, check out all of MainMan Michael Rank's other releases as solo, Clarrisa, Marat and early S.O.P. It's all good, as the saying goes."
5,The Best,"I used this Dome 612 for my service business for 15 years even before I owned a computer. When I retired from it, I still use this for my monthly/year long personal expenses and budget for the next year. Never will go without this even now that I got eight computers in my house/home office."
5,Love it,explains where to put which amount.great for those of us that do not have bookkeeping background.All ready for the accountant
4,rental property,it is hard to find a ledger book that has all the specific expenses that are needed so I have to write in catergories myself. but over all its not to bad.
5,Good for simple accounting and income tax preparation,I have used this book for years and have come to depend on it for a hard copy accounting for my self-employment business. Set up so it can be used easily.
4,simple product to use,"Dome makes the best bookkeeping books for every day users. Very simple to use, i buy one every year."
2,Disappointing and too expensive,"I was very disappointed with this purchase because very few, if any, of the activities are unique. It's only advantage is that it collates a good number of activities together in one place. However, I don't feel that the price for this collection is worth it given that I found most of these activities on the internet, for free, and on more than one site."
2,Not that great,"I felt the the book was way overpriced for the content. It came as a three ring binder with just copies of pages. Regarding the actual material, I got very little out of it."
3,"Great concept, but has a flaw","I was so excited when this arrived. I quickly cleaned it and filled it with cereal. My glee was quickly turned to disappointment. The rubber flap, which is controlled by the knob and allows the flow of the dry goods, is not strong enough to stop the flow of Cheerios effectively and it could not provide an airtight seal. Some Cheerios were trapped between the rubber flap and the side wall of the container. I think if the rubber flap was not so flimsy, it might actually work as intended. Maybe the Zevro brand dispensers are better..."
3,"Season 6, Part 2","This set includes 4 disks with 2 shows per disk +1, total of 7 episodes. Talk about OUT OF ORDER!!!!! The episodes are:83 OCC Road Show Originally Aired: 8/21/200684 OCC Production Bike Originally Aired: 8/28/200664 On the Road: Europe Part 1 Originally Aired: 10/30/200565 On the Road: Europe Part 2 Originally Aired: 11/7/200568 Make-A-Wish Bike Originally Aired: 12/19/200567 Behind the Scenes Special Originally Aired: 11/21/200566 History of the OCC Originally Aired:11/14/2005I believe these sets are privately produced by Amazon, definitely not by the Learning Channel's production company. This is a bare bones set. NO special features, not even a disk menu to choose episodes on each disk. Discovery did much better with seasons 1-3, these new sets leave much to be desired, and at around $5 per episode, the price is steep. Still fun if you want to have these episodes. Come on Learning/Discovery- you can do better than this!!!!!"
3,american chopper series,the later series get worse of this cable show. Most of the programs are no longer for corporations but for charities as the teautals make themselves look good
5,"Witty, tongue-in-check, modern day Aesop fable","Stewart is a young painter who goes on safari in search of a model worthy of his talents. Alas, Stewart is also rude, very rude. The colorful illustrations combine a certain worldly sophistication with the first attempts at drawing of a young child. Not for those who must have only sweetness and happy endings in children's literature."
4,I loved it!!,"In my view this was Diamond's best album of the 1980's after the Jazz Singer. He returns to his rock roots. Had this album came right after the ""Jazz Singer"" it would have been a major hit. Sadly, by the time it came out, Neil's had gotten himself kicked off of mainstream radio due to demographics changes."
4,"It's the ""Timing"" That Counts!","Have you ever wanted to ""off"" your spouse? Yes? Well suppose, just suppose, he/she was thinking the same thing about you -- at the same time .....Taken to an absurd extreme, this hilarious book will walk you down the paths of decision, indecision, and true love.At a mere 154 pages and full of contemporary, snappy (and adult) dialogue, Jay Cronley has written a wry tale with which you can pleasantly while away an afternoon."
4,Good Cord,"Not sure how to review a power cord, other than it works. My only complaint, and this is strictly comparing to an actual power transformer, is that the PJ3 printer doesn't print as fast if it doesn't have a full 14V. So, using this cord you get exactly the voltage supplied by the battery or alternator from your vehicle. Using this on a motorcycle, it prints rather slow. I eventually moved this to my car, and it works better, but is still slow compared to a regular power supply."
3,ok-could be better,"my son loves v-smile and Blues Clues. He likes this game but I think it could be better. It seems a bit stiff as far as the animation goes. there are also parts where the narrator talks - but you can not hit enter to fast forward through those parts. that's a problem with a 4 year old who is anxious to start the game. I think this is a good game for kids who have some v-smile experience - and are able to do basic concepts like matching objects, grouping objects in categories (in one game, you have to sort different items like different clocks/watches, school supplies, and bath items and distribute them to the characters. here, my son just guesses because he can't really tell what some of the items are or where they go). For a first game , I would definitely not choose this one but get Lion King, Pooh, or Elmo instead. BUt it is kinda cute and he likes playing with it."
3,Liv's mom,OK game. My 3 year old loves Blue but initially I needed to show her what to do. Sometime I found the directions confusing. On some portions the game won't accept your actions unless Blue is perfectly where she needs to be to advance to the next thing. Can be hard until your child really gets used to fine motor skills. She likes Lion King and Adventure Park better.
4,great fun but just for first 3 days,"i bought this 2 wks ago....my 3 and a half yr old son hated the game which came in the box but when i gave him blues clues he loved it and learned it in just one day ... but now he doesnt play with it anymore after 3 days and insists on playing the game which came with box and then he gets frustrated with that one and starts crying...i guess blues clues is so easy and have very few games and doesnt use the colored buttons on joystick at all....anyway i have ordered barney and elmo now...i got blues clues for $21 and now, both barney and elmo for just for $21....."
3,An ok starter game,"Alot of these v smile games have really crappy graphics, this ones not not the best. Out of all the games in this age range, it's not one of her favorites but she does occasionally play it. She's had it for 6 months and other games have become more interesting. This one is kind of for real beginners, like maybe in the 3 year old range. I purchased the v smile for her for Christmas along with about 7 games. My only mistake was to give them all to her at once. As with any 4 year old, who is having their first game system experience, she would play a game for a minute or two and then get discouraged and put in another. I had to take them all away and let her choose one game to play per day. Whichever game she chose for that day was the only one she got no matter how hard she found it. That did the trick, she learned how to play all of them in this manner and now I let her choose as she pleases."
2,LEAST FAVORITE GAME,My 3 year old has 8 Vsmile games and this is his least favorite. His top 2 favorite is Toy story and Winnie the Pooh.
1,"I hate it, but my brother likes it","I HATE THIS GAME!! It isn't fun at all for me (yes, I am a 10 and a half year-old girl) but my brother likes it, I don't know why. My brother is 7. I think this is an awful learning system. First of all, there is a six letter limit to how many letters you can have for your name (my biggest problem) so I can't fit my whole name nor my daddy's whole name. Second of all, when you need help with something, all Joe does is say ""Hi"" instead of giving you instructions. And instead of actually being fun, all you're doing is following instructions and doing things right like you would in school. This game is no fun. Also I'm really not fond of Joe. I have played this and ""Blue takes you to school"". I also wonder, if JOE IS OBSESSED WITH THE NUMBER 4?? ""Blue takes you to school"" isn't fun either. That game is boring and has an 8 letter limit to your name. This is one of the worst games ever made. Please do not buy this!!"
4,Good,"""Ain't no Rock"" is the best song. Her next albulm, ""Holy Days"" is much better features songs written by Chariya. This is a good funky CD to buy; very fun."
5,I love this and here's why.,"You know how you go to a bowling alley and when ever you hand the guy at the counter back your bowling shes the sprays the shoes with that can of what ever, well here's the can! I mean you could have been handed the wrong size and you tell the guy and he still sprays the hell out of it like you have some disease! This is the spray! LOL i know right!"
4,Director 8 and Lingo Authorised,"This book clearly describes director , shockwave and Lingo. Examples are given to illustrate the various concepts covered in the book. However, the converage of Lingo is not extensive , Director 7 Demystified offers better description of the Lingo programming model.Its a good book for beginners , however , for a extensive understand of Lingo , Director 7 Desmystified is a better choice"
2,Director 8 and Lingo Authorized,"This book is not correct. the pictures that is shows in it is just a reformatted version of director 7 and lingo. the text, pictures and the lingo are all director 7, wil little to no director 8 features"
1,Director 8 and Lingo Authorized,"If you bought the 7, .....i cannot find a single different thing between 7 and 8. All the Chapter and material are same."
1,too rudimentary for even the absolute beginner,"our school used to provide this book to the students of its director-intro-class.more then the first half of the book focuses on linear-score-animation. it is not until well into the book that the reader ever even encounters lingo at all.the skills demonstrated in this book are the skills which students of our director-intro class posess after the first day.now.. if you want to do nothing more than corporate, powerpoint presentations in director and don't know how to do them, then this is the book for you.but if you want to gain any skills above your text or image floating across the screen with a cheesy transition, stay away from this book and look elsewhere."
4,"Historical fiction as history, but fun.","Very enjoyable, however the attempt to synthesize what we know historically with the later, non-Welsh or Breton Matter of Britain, moves it into the realm of historical fiction, I think. It would form the basis for excellent fiction.So, as for me, with my present level of knowledge, I don't regard this work as history, but it IS one of the better and more enjoyable works on the subject.Yet, to paraphrase an early historian, ""He is no John Morris."""
3,Rape and Pillage,"This book is almost exclusively concerned with battles. The author speculates about who led them, where they were located, how many troops of what type, whether a reported length of three days does or does not include a final day in which the fleeing members of the routed army were hunted down by the victors. There are occasionally some paragraphs interspersed which remark on the culture of the time, the lineage of one family or another, perhaps even land ownership or farming methods. It's hard for a novice to know whether this accurately reflects an era in which war was even more common and its carnage even more devastating to the average human than in our own time, or whether it is solely the bias of the writer, like a tale of the last decade as told by Secretary Rumsfeld."
3,Don't know what to make of this,"This is a fascinating book. I found a copy at my public library and I've been hoping to find one to own. It seems to be out of print. As I said, the material is fascinating and it includes what seems to be extensive documentation. I have a question I was hoping someone could answer for me -- why is it so amateurishly printed? It looks like it was done at home with an early 1980s-vintage dot-matrix printer and IBM-clone home computer. If the research is serious and legitimate, why wasn't this book published in a serious and legitimate form?"
2,Am i missing something here?,"I must admit i bought the album because of the cover. I still love the cover. It made the album look really good. Then i saw that this album has a title that is without a doubt, one of the best album titles ever. So maybe i was expecting more, or something different, i don't know, but i didn't like the album itself. I listened to it over and over, really hoping i'd like it because i wanted to so bad. But, it did nothing for me. Time and again, i was agitated, and was skipping songs til the album ended. I usually love ambient-like music. Her voice is beatiful, i'll say that. But i just couldn't consider it a great piece of work. I'm sorry."
3,Beautiful photos but Low on Tips,"When I purchased ""Backroads of Minnesota,"" I was under the impression that it would have detailed information on where to venture for hidden treasures in terms of getting away from the big city. Well, what I got instead was a beautiful ""picture"" book chocked full of wonderful photography of various areas in Minnesota. So, I was disappointed and delighted at the same time. It's not what I was hoping for, but it compliments my library quite nicely.Don't get me wrong, there are a few descriptions here and there, but don't expect to use it to find various places, but rather, to know what to you might be able to expect if you explore areas near where the photos were taken.It's a good investment if you understand this premise."
4,backroads of minnesota: your guide to minnesota's scenic backroad adventures,I will enjoy traveling the backroads of minnesota. going the backroads to new places i haven't been to before.
1,Easily the worst album in the Dylan canon,"It could have been a transcendent moment, but ""Dylan and the Dead"" is so bad that it defies description. I have been a die hard Dylan fan from the mid-70's, own all the official albums, a lot of unofficial albums and a lot of Bob's rarities. This is the absolute bottom of the barrel in terms of both performances and song choice. (I cannot think of a single reason why ""Joey"" should have been included--terrible song, terrible performance). This album is for completists only."
4,Nice Companion for a Dylan Fan,"I have read a lot of scathing reviews about this album, and I'm here to set the record straight. Aside from a questionable list of songs, this album is a great example of Dylan at his throw-the-paint-on-the-canvas best. I might be in the minority when I suggest that Dylan's forgotten words and muffled voice exemplify his confidence rather than his shortcomings. I enjoy the ""Slow Train"" on this album better than its underdeveloped sister studio song because Dylan's inflection and rawness give it the muscle that it lacked. Let's not forget about Garcia either, whose solo brilliance (I Want You) shines at times. Yes, the songs are loose and Dylan and Garcia are unsure at times when a solo should begin (""Serve Somebody""), but if Dylan has taught us anything, it is that art mimics life. This album is a fine example of that."
4,Should Have Been Better,"I've heard the half dozen shows Mr. D recorded with the Grateful Dead and my question to the boys in the suits and I guess to Mr. D himself is, ""How could you guys have blown it so hard?"" These shows were all great and one of them should have been released in it's entirety. Instead, somehow we get a hodge podge effort that seems like it was thrown together as an after thought. Believe me, there isn't anyone on God's green earth who is a bigger Dylan fan than me, not even that guy who used to go through his garbage all those years ago, wading through used pampers, looking for Dylan info. But even I was disappointed in this one. Still it's Bob and the Dead and if you don't have access to the tapes of the shows, then you gotta have this one even though I can only give it four stars."
4,Essential Dylan,"A raw, ragged and powerful live performance. Lots of VERY negative reviews that I just do not get.Best ""on-record"" live version of ""All Along The Watchtower"" I have heard. Worth buying the album for that track alone!!If you are looking for an on-stage reproduction of studio-recorded songs then forget it! Dylan does not do that on stage anyway!!"
3,Worth it for Queen Jane alone,"Like may fans I've avoided this CD like the plague. In the end I bought it out of curiosity, how bad could it really be? Having been pleasantly surprised by other ""worst"" Dylan albums including Self Portrait (a minor masterpiece) I was not disappointed. Queen Jane shines like a diamond from the bedrock. It's raw, emotional and exhilarating, worth it for that performance alone."
3,A meeting of rock giants that falls short.,"When this album was released, Dylan and Dead fans were giddy with excitement only to be disappointed by the lackluster, footdragging performances it contained. While the Dead do an excellent job of interpreting Dylan's songs with their chugging, guitar-oriented style, it is Dylan's performance, ultimately that dooms this project. He sounds either drunk or downright bored on most of the songs, slurring most of the lyrics communicating a feeling that his heart just isn't in it. While this album is superior to and far more engaging than Dylan's previous two failures ""Knocked Out Loaded"" and ""Down In The Groove"", it is still evocative of the mediocre and heartless spirit behind so much of his work in the 80s."
3,Not that bad,"Whats so bad wioth this album? I love Dylan, and I love the Dead, and they sound exactly as one would think a combination of the two would sound. Not great, but not that bad, and ""Joey"" and ""Queen Jane Approximately"" are both good songs. How could a voice as unique as Dylan's really go well with a different guitar, etc. Not great but deffinately worth having"
1,Unbearable,"Great cover. Unfortunately, the music is just godoffal. Like the movie ""Hearts of Fire,"" the release of these live recordings seems to suggest that Dylan has finally found his legend too much to bear. ""You think I'm great?"" he seems to be asking. ""Well then, how do you explain this crap?"" On ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" and ""Slow Train,"" perhaps the best tracks only because they haven't been done to death on live albums, Dylan doesn't even seem to know the lyrics, and what might have been a good rendition of ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" is completely sabotaged by that foolish addition to the chorus (""Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door/like so many times before""). This may very well be the worst Dylan record ever."
1,I am still trying to forget it,"The first time I listened to it was horrible--I closed my eyes, trying to make it sound better, but it just got worse and worse. I've listened to this album three times, and I still hate it. I hate every song. There are some songs on this album that I would have no clue what they are unless I had the jacket in front of me. If we all go to Purgatory, this one was Bob Dylan's visit."
1,Live and Dead,"Skip this completely, even if your a die hard Dylan and/or Dead fan . This is a tired, rambling, sloppy and largely (if not wholely) unlistenable album that will have you questioning the Dead's live reputation and Dylan's ability to bring it all back home. ""Hard Rain"" is a much better ""sloppy"" album with better songs and Mr. Nasel in better voice. ""After the Flood"" is a tour de force in comparison to this muddle. Deadheads take note: after hearing the Band rev Dylan up on ""Flood"" you may find a new passion: trying to get that band to reunite (with Robbie R.)."
1,Two powerful artistic forces...one terrible album.,"Let's just put all the cards on the table, this is probably the worst album of Bob Dylan's career...and from what little contribution the Dead seem to make here...theirs as well. I love Dylan. I love the Grateful Dead. I hate this album. All the songs here are Dylan's, the Dead only serving as his band. I haven't been more disappointed by the outcome of such a wonderful idea in all my life. The only thing that makes this album worth buying...is the cover."
1,"Slow, As in ""Slow Train""","There's a good reason that ""Slow Train"" opens this disc. Record companies put what seems to be the album's strongest track first. This will insure airplay. And true, this track did get some airplay. It's the album's strongest track as far as vocals from Dylan and the Grateful Dead's performance. The rest of the record is weak on both counts. I'm not sure a remix and a remastering job would help. I couldn't get to any of these shows and was anxious to hear the results. This was an overwhelming disappointment. One track does not make a good album. I'm not sure I can pin the blame for this poor release on either artist. Maybe some things just aren't meant to be. And while I would'nt us the disc as drink coaster, maybe one could justify purchasing this used just to complete the collection."
3,Does this really need to be reviewed,"Do you really need to read a review of this. Its Bob Dylan and Grateful dead, i mean come on, can you find a better combination of people to put together. The album jams pretty good. I love the mellow jam throughout Knockin' On heaven's door. This will probably not be an album you listen to everyday, but is one that when you put it on you will play it all the way through."
2,"Marginal, but still worth a listen","The album is decent. The idea of the dead and dylan rocking out together sends shivers up my spine it is such an amazing concept. However, the music is not that great. Both bands are better than this album would lead you to believe. The sound is sloppy, some guitar slip ups, some timing issues. Engineering seems a bit off too, but live shows are always a bitch to cover. In their favor, it would not suprise me if all of them were tripping face on LSD, so one may not be TOO critical. Worth a listen, find it used, burn it for your friends."
3,"Not great, but not bad","Having seen the Dylan/Dead show at Oakland Coliseum, I was surprised that this release didn't have the jump that much of the show I attended did. Still, it's not bad. The Dead were arguably the best interpreters of Dylan's songs and they had a great feel for the songs, Jerry especially. I liked the inclusion of ""Joey"". For those who want a superb collection of Dylan's songs reinterpreted, buy the Dead's ""Postcards of the hanging."""
3,A trashed album that just doesn't try,"Let's get real here. This album's not as horrible as they want you to think, it's just loose. Many people like to blame Dylan for the shortcomings of this set, but I hold the Dead equally accountable. Their accompaniment is plodding and uninspired, and to my ears Dylan's slurry whine fits right in there. The album could've been leagues better had they left off ""Joey,"" in favor of any two other songs. Of course, there are some great moments, a wild ""All Along The Watchtower,"" the rebirth of ""Queen Jane Approximately,"" and the haunting closer, ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door."" These songs, to my ears, a fine performances. If only the whole album could've been as consistent. Dylan and the Dead did make great music on that tour, it's just not fairly represented on ""Dylan and The Dead."""
1,The best laid plans of mice and men...,"If it were up to me, I would install this cd on the sound system at a maximum-security prison and play this constantly in lieu of the death penalty. Of course, the Supreme Court would rule this as ""Cruel and Unusual Punishment."" I love Bob Dylan, and I love the Dead. I absolutely despise this album, and I want to use it as a drink coaster instead of a cd. The only cool thing on here is the cover. Otherwise, it's trash."
1,A Brilliant Collaboration 10 Years Too Late,"It's a real shame these Super Powers didn't have the foresight to have made this happen in the 70's back when Dylan actually sounded decent vocally and the Dead were so much tighter and explosive. I can only imagine how good this could have been. Here, however, we're left with something that could have been played live but certainly not fit for release."
2,Disappointing.,"To think that two legends would be on the same album is temptation enough to buy it. But, one listen and you will see that this is not the best by either artist. This is one to own after you have all the top notch albums by both Dylan and Te Grateful Dead. Save this for last to complete your collection."
2,Dylan/Dead,"I own just about every one of Dylan's studio albums and the entire Bootleg Series to date. Likewise - as my intermittently depleted bank account and beans/rice diet will attest - almost every commercial Dead release (love that cleaned up sound!). While there's a significant margin for subjectivity even among otherwise rabid fans, the unusual balance (that is, for ANYTHING bearing the Dead's name on Amazon) between the upper and lower ratings strata are indicative of a product that likely will require a nuanced taste. Sample it thoroughly first, either here or on itunes, to check the fit."
1,A great cd!!!,"great for curing insomnia, that is. What a lifeless and dull album. The person I bought it from said it as one of his all time favorites...either he was joking with me or needs some help! Seriously though, this isnt to bash Bob. Its just that you expect more from 2 legendary artists! Why was this ever released? ""Joey"" is by far the worst cut on this record...i simply cant understand a word of what hes saying; just 10 minutes of babble (literally), and listen to how the tempo speeds up and slows down, like the Dead wasnt even paying attention! Id expect this from a garage band, not the dead and dylan! I couldnt believe they coulndt even hold a standard 4/4 beat. What else can I say, but what a complete disappointment."
2,2 stars,"someone with the initials ste once said that this album may very well be the worst in either artist's catalogue,but i doni't really think that's true. also i find dylan's lesser releases to be kind of charming, and i've never really understood the greatness of europe '72."
3,Are you a true fan ..?,"I bought the record when it was released. Don't compare it with any other Dylan live 'cause it 's different. The voice sounds tired to say the least and the arrangements are, well, different. I feel the collaboration had too much 'Dylan' in it and not much dead at all. Anybody who has seen the publicity photo with Bob in the center surrounded by the deads looking at him would know what I mean. It was Dylan backed by a group called Dead and not 'Dylan and the dead.' Give it a shot if you are a true Dylan fan. Not one of those who expect a gem all the time. He is human too .. Isn't he ..? Wish Garcia were still around and ... well, I wish."
4,Its actually quite nice,"I am a bit surprised by the bad comments here, this is a nice CD but not a typical Dylan record. It does not have the folksy sound one associated with the Dylan songs but I actually liked the new sound with Dead. Its relaxing sound but again not typical Dylan record as one would expect."
4,Not THAT bad,"Sure, this CD has a few flaws here and there but overall these two bands compose a great musical juggernaut which is too powerful to be destroyed by a few mistakes."
1,Buyer beware! Tracks are mis-labeled!,"Regarding the Amazon MP3 files from this ""Dylan & the Grateful Dead"" album, two tracks have their labels mixed up: ""All Along The Watchtower"" is ""Knocking On Heaven's Door"", and vice-versa. I only discovered this problem after I had bought one thinking I had the other - then I had to buy the other one too to get the track I wanted. I would complain to Amazon but couldn't find a place to do that."
3,"Not bad, but not great","The remastering sounds really good on this. It's not compressed too much, and there's nice low end from Phil Lesh and the drummers. Jerry Garcia turns in some decent guitar solos, although the tempos rush and drag here and there. Not the poo-poo stick many claim this to be, but it's not fantastic, either. I'll reach more often for Dylan/The Band's ""Before the Flood,"" which has quite a bit more punch and grit."
3,"Forget Dylan, Listen To Garcia","Being a Dylan fan of sorts (moreso early than later)and a so so Dead fan I found this album of interest and after listening to it several times decided it's not bad at all, in fact it has some bright spots. It's probably Dylan at his worst or as some reviewer put it, his most relaxed??? But Garcia and the Dead are the bright spot here. I'm not sure who was back up for whom. Perhaps this is a Garcia interpretation having listened to Dylan all those years, but whatever the case, there is merit here. If you do nothing else but listen to Garcia this is an excellent album and one that I'm glad I purchased despite almost not doing so because of the negative reviews. Besides, the price was right."
4,Great,These sheets of avery business card holders were perfect for what I needed them for. If I need them again I know where to get them.
5,Just what I needed.,"Product is exactly what you would expect. Slots for 10 business cards, 20 if you double up and use both sides."
5,Use em for work,I needed to organize my business cards for work. For under five dollars this is the perfect solution. The sleeves seem durable and I'll buy more as I need them. Very satisfied.
4,Good Video; wrong title,"I like this tape a lot; think it's very informative and fun. Bill Nye is terrific as usual; the show is well-written and well done.My quibble is that it's called Human Body and it's really two shows: one about SKIN and one about the HEART AND CIRCULATION.So I bought it thinking it would be an overview of the human body and instead it's two shows about two specific aspects of the human body.So I just wanted to warn other potential buyers.Buy it and enjoy, but know what it's about."
3,"Great theme, limited execution","The 1960s are, as Carroll suggests, pro football's best decade, but this book doesn't quite bring that assertion to life. It's written rather functionally and relies rather too heavily on facts instead of anecdotes or the author's own assertions. It recites too many stories that the devoted fan already knows, and doesn't quite manage to tell them in an interesting new way. There are interviews with players, some of which are mildly enlightening, and some photographs, most of which I'd seen before.I was hoping for something which would tell me more about this period of the game which I didn't already know, and less about things I could have looked up in a reference book.Would give this a marginal recommendation, with a heartier one to those who know little about the decade in question. For those who do, I'd suggest Daly and O'Donnell's ""Pro Football Chronicle."""
3,"Ok for learning the tools, but not much else...","I am really dissappointed in this book. If I could return it, I would. I thought I was getting a book that would show start to finish how to create some nice models that could be used. Almost every tutorial in this book starts by you loading a file instead of SHOWING you how it was created. It does however show you what the tools in gmax do. I've gone halfway through this book and I still feel I do not know enough about gmax to actually use it.The book shows some nice color images of models created by other people, but doesn't even come close to showing you how they were created. I have found better tutorials on the net than this book has in it.In my opinion, search the net for ""gmax tutorial"" and you can get better information."
1,Waste of money,Don't waste your money on this book. I'm trying to return it as I type this review. Nothing in it that you can't find in the gmax docs.
3,1st time user's opinion,"This book appears to cover the subject well (as far as a novice can tell), but I do not find it easy to find the answer when I come up against a problem, as I frequently do!"
1,"GMAX Bible, switch and bait / false advertsing","Warning: There are NO demos with this book, most notably missing is the Combat Flight Simulator 3 Demo. Its not there.The book has ONE paragraph (less than 100 words) covering anything related to Renegade modding.If I could rate this 1/3 of a star I would. This is blatent switch and bait tactics. Whats advertised is not what you are going to get.Very disappointed, borderline disgusted. I rate this a no buy."
5,A self-help book that reads like a fast-paced novel.,"I was fortnuate enough to get an advance copy of this book before its release. I don't like self-help books and have never managed to complete reading one. WINNING WITH THE VELVET TOUCH took me on a ride with interesting stories and relevant anticdotes that made the point without preaching. The point of the book is simple, yet invaluable: If you get people on your side you will accomplish so much more than if you go it alone. Books like ""Winning Through Intimidation"" seem old fashioned and out-of-date compared to the dynamic principals of WINNING WITH THE VELVET TOUCH. I have followed the examples this book illustrates with great success and rewarding results."
1,Not worth the paper it is printed on,"If you took the phrase ""velvet touch"" out of this thin book, it would be half the size. If you really think you want to spend money on the book then here is the whole book:Be nice to people, even in difficult situations.(add your example of when that benefited yourself and now you have the entire book)"
2,Not very plased,"I thought this product was good when I felt it in my hands. It covered my Desire HD perfectly, for about two weeks. It's been more then six months since I got this and it has stretched way beyond the body of my phone now offering significantly less coverage. Just got the Otterbox HTC Desire HD Commuter Case, Love it!!!!!"
2,Very disappointing,I was hoping for a great collection of vintage and rare Mickey Mouse cartoons. That's not what I got. Steam Boat Willy was shown with a large black boarder surrounding the cartoon. I assume it was so the entire frame could be seen. Cartoons two and three were complete rare sound films. However the remaining cartoons were not original prints. The openings were created electronically. The cartoons were very enjoyable but don't expect a collection of all original prints.
4,bilrd collar,My bird is s feather picker but I have stopped using a collar since he stopped picking out his tail feathers. This worked for us.
5,Does the job and a good value,Can't complain about the price and the product does exactly what it is supposed to do. Connect my servers to my PDU.
5,Great quality,"Good extension cord for computers or monitors, very good build quality not cheap. I would definately recommend this to anyone that needs this type of extension cord."
5,You know what cheeses me off?,"Years ago, HP would send these with a server. I never knew why people would want this type of plug or PDU format. What can I say? I was young and dumb. I probably threw away 50 of these things. Later on I learned that servers draw less power at higher voltage, and my eyes were opened widely- an epiphany to be sure. Save on the power bill, save the environment (fewer step downs = less power loss = better PUE*). With the shame of remembering how many I threw away, I now have to buy these separately because HP and Dell need to shave a penny somewhere in costs. Bah! Back in my day they came with this cord, and iced cream was a nickel, and I walked twenty miles to school, uphill- both ways!*PUE is a power efficiency metric. Don't worry- there won't be a quiz later."
5,Great for portable display boards,"I was creating a display board and wanted to be able to change some of the papers in and out to fit the theme for different activities.This works great!I have some of them vertical, some on an angle and some horizontal. All stay in place very well and the papers I have inserted are easy to change.It seems quite durable, but for my use not many people are bumping it, etc. so that hasn't been tested (nor do I hope to test it)."
4,kitchen recipes,I use this in the kitchen when I'm trying new recipes. I stick this on the cupboard door and put the recipe in. Keeps the counter top clear and I can read the recipe from eye level
1,HIGHLY OVERPRICED!!!!,"BUYER BEWARE!!!!!DO NOT BUY THESE FROM AMAZON FOR THE PRICE!!I made the mistake of buying these without shopping around. AFTER making the purchase I saw the same darn thing at Target for a fraction of the cost! Infact they had a package of 100 for about what I paid for a pack of 10!!!I usually love Amazon's deal, but they dropped the ball on this one! This is a horrible rip off!!!"
2,Reprint too small,"The original book was wider than the average book. When they did the softback reprint they had to reduce the print to fit the more narrow format. This not only left considerable white space above and below the text, but the text, especially in the charts, is entirely too small to read, some even with a magnifying glass.I returned the book, but Amazon gave a full refund, even the postage one way."
2,Why I gave it only two stars!,I gave only two stars because of the small print. It strains your eyes. This is a great book but you just can't read it. Buy the Dispensational Truth just make sure of the print size. I should have.
2,Unexpected dissapointment,"Ordered this for a friends christmas present and also ordered ""The greatest book on Dispensational Truth in the world"" by same author for myself. To my horror, inside of this lovely cover, is a bad, minimised copy, page for page of the same book that i purchased above for myself. None of my friends could read the tiny print. I am very disappointed especially because this is supposed to be the revised edition and it even cost more. I am stuck with a book i cant use because it costs a lot to return it and cant find anyone so far who can read it without straining. Its a shame but if you are interested, the one i bought above for myself is cheaper, also on amazon, and is comfortable to read and has a strong binding. Hope this is helpful to you."
4,"DIspensational Truth or God's Plan and Purpose for the Ages, Paperback copy",Great book. The repoduced print is somewhat difficult to read especially with the extremely small print on the charts.
3,horrible copy of a great book,"this book looks like each page was put on a copy machine then bound up by a hard binding. The pages of text are certainly legible but most of the charts are impossible to read, even with a magnifying glass. The kindle edition for $3.99 is much better or there's even a website (preserved word) where you can see the charts much much clearer. Great content in the book and I can't wait to finish it, but this is a really bad copy.May the lamb that was slain receive the reward for His suffering!"
1,photocopied,"This book is a ""copy"" of the original. By copy, I mean it looks like they took it to a copy machine and photocopied the pages. The charts are cut off, and incomplete. Some of the charts are not centered on the pages and surrounded by black from the copy machine. It is poorly done and I will be returning it for a refund."
3,Dispensational Truth,"I was very disappointed in the book. I have had one for several years and love it, but this issue is smaller and the pictures, which are the most important part of the book, look like they were photocopied. The size is reduced, they overlap (like it was copied while still in the book,instead of taking it apart), and they are hard to read. I bought the book as a gift for my pastor, and hate that it wasn't what I thought it would be."
2,The wrong one...,"All,I purchased this book and the witting and illustrations in the book looks horrible. There are about 3-4 inch margins between the edge of the book and the writing/illustrations. There is another one here on amazon that has full illustrations, look for it.As for the book, it is very good and an interesting read."
1,sounds like a fire alarm,"Pros: it works, and its loudCons: it runs off of little watch batteries, it can not be used has a door chime because it sounds like a fire alarm, it's just a loud siren, and it already is giving a low battery after it only went off one time.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,"It worked for a bit, and broke with the help of little kids.","It was for my retail store, and it's made out of fairly cheap plastic. Our doors were metal/glass, and there was not a great place to put it so that the sensors lined up perfectly, so we had to have it near a window sill - which is within little kids' reach, which is why it didn't last a month or two."
2,Techko Magnetic entry sensors,"Purchased, returned and got full credit/refund. Either alarm casing or battery was defective. Never got it to sound .."
4,And yet it improves your game,"This book was recommended to me by an ""A"" player back when I was rated 1300. He said it helped his game by 300 pts. It did the same for me. Its kind of like Nimzo on tranquilizers."
2,Expensive but not worth it,"I purchased this so I can have hot water all the time without having to boil on the stovetop. I returned this product, after receiving because I don't like the non stick coating on the interior. Instead I purchased Sunpentown SP-3618 Stainless Steel Hot Water Pot with Multi-Temp Function. This was much cheaper in price and had the stainless stain interior without the nonstick coating. It also has a nice light up feature when you press the unlock button for dispensing the water, which is good at night. You don't have to turn on the light to see where to put your cup."
1,No On/Off switch,"This dispenser doesn't have the On/Off switch, which was not immediately clear from reading the item description. Unplugging it all the time is not a good or safe option. I returned it to the seller and was charged approx. $9 for shipping"
4,What a great convenience for tea enthusiasts...,"Although the initial heat-up period is a bit long (I think about 15 minutes...long enough for me to forget to keep track anyway :-), once the water reaches the proper temperature, this is a wonderfully convenient product--so far we use ours primarily for those evening cups of tea, but occasionally we find it useful for other applications needing a quick dose of hot water. The steel with black exterior fits in perfectly with the other stainless appliances in our new kitchen as well so we don't feel a need to hide it--although there is a decent amount of hot steam released during the boil-mode (I just slide it forward so the steam is not captured under the cabinets), the exterior remains a comfortable temperature to touch. Except that we found it to be a bit high in price, we are very pleased with the function and appearance overall and would eagerly recommend it."
1,Bulky and Poorly Insulated,"I have two issues with this item:1. It is bulky. The image may not show it but it has almost the same footprint as a 4.0 liter model (just a bit shorter).2. What is worse, some surface area is burning HOT. Like the top: when I first put my palm down, I almost jumped---it was burning like hot water from the faucet. At first I thought it just finished boiling water. But it stayed that way throughout the day. The side area is a little better, but it is still very warm.It seems to me a poorly built product. I don't know if the engineer who designed it would use it everyday him/herself. Definitely NOT recommended."
1,Rusty!,It gets rust at the rim and the top ventilation holes. Very low quality product. Avoid. Very disappointed with this line of water boiler. I thought it was dirt but the 'brown' stuff turned out to be rust.
4,"Insight on living with chronic pain, ""loss of vital powers""","Schmookler gives the reader a new perspective on understanding the ever changing life of people living with chronic pain/illness. This book was a wonderful motivator for myself. It reminds you that you are not the only one out there struggling to hold on to anything you can as your ""vital powers"" are gradually stolen away unexpectedly (or expectedly). Schmookler gives the reader knowledge, support, and strength to fight back against their own theif or the theif of a loved one."
1,Why Can't They Label Mixed CDs as such,"This drives me absolutely crazy and I have been bitten by it numerous times from CDs on Amazon. You buy a compilation CD from Amazon, thinking that you are buying the original and uncut songs as recorded by the artist but what you get is a MIXED cd where you the songs are all mixed together. That is what this CD is - A MIXED CD. I wish Amazon would do something about this and mark these DJ mixed CDs as such. Anyone want a 6 CD box set paperweight?"
1,I would give this a BIG FAT ZERO!,I cannot believe the junk they put out on compilations!!There were so many GREAT dance numbers from disco up to Punk and everything in between. I have better stuff on VINYL and recorded from the mixes on radio!No wonder why these things DO NOT sell! People are sick of finding a few good cuts on a CD and the rest are totally NASTY PLUS PLUS! I guess the recording houses have not learned YET!I BET I could put together a slamming dance box set THAT WOULD SELL LIKE CRAZY!WILL SOMEBODY KINDLY GET IT TOGETHER...HUH!?I have been searching for HOURS and looking for YEARS for SOMETHING good...CRAP piled high is what I have found :(TOTALLY FED UP WITH THE MUSIC INDUSTRY! SICK of PIECES of good mixed with GARBAGE!
5,My favorite,"I have used this book for over 20 yrs. No other style fits my needs. It keeps one employee's pay and tax info for one year on one page, and monthly, quarterly, and yearly totals in the back. I have a very hard time finding them locally, even at Office Depot, Office Max, Staples."
4,"Great photos, great factual text, editorial text iffy","some of the editorial text gets a little political and I suspect it is speculative, as author goes on to say that there are no records surviving.The photos are worth the price of the book however."
4,Works as it should.,I purchased from eComElectronics. So far it seems to be working as it should. I had the Trouble Light still on and had to contact the Security company who walked me through the steps to discover that the date/time needed to be set again. Once that was carried out the light went off. eComElectronics was great at communicating and resolving concerns promptly.
1,Security system battery back up,"We are very disappointed with this battery. Usually they last for a year, but this last one only lasted three months. Apparently it is inferior to those previously purchased; however, it is half the cost."
5,"Excellent, great!","Great, awesome! Super fast shipping! Plugged it right in, came charged and working! Very pleased! This was a very pleasant shopping experience, will shop here again."
1,Dead within a month!,"I used this rechargeable one for my home alarm panel and the thing died within 2 to 3 weeks. I know it was the battery failing when the alarm siren started making the constant ""chirping"" sound again and as soon as I installed a new standard battery (not the rechargeable one but the same brand), the sound went away."
3,Is it new?,"I bought one from Battery Supersite. The battery I got has scratch marks on its bottom. It seems like it has sat on a concrete floor without any protection. When I buy a rechargeable battery, I don't want to buy a used one. I hope mine is not used."
2,Battery looks fine,"The battery I received looks fine, I can not say more due to the fact that I only got one and ordered and paid for 2. My UPS needs 2 to work so for now it is a boat anchor. It has been well over 5 weeks, first 2 were so-called ""lost in shipment"", second single battery was sent to Tx for some reason, and then arrived here a week later. I imagine they would work fine in a ""pair"" but I guess I will never know!"
3,"Good Product, Bad Shipping Packaging.","The battery arrived in a USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate Mailing Envelope. It was torn and was taped where the battery had made several holes in the envelope. There was no invoice or it might have fallen out. The good news is after installing the battery, my low battery alarm is gone. Seriously, I would pay a bit more for better packaging than an envelope."
5,Security system Battery,Order came to me in 2 days. All was as presented. Saved me a service call from security company. Very pleased with product and ease of ordering.
5,Backup battery.,got this for a battery backup system for a car stereo that is in a portable box that is unhooked from power every day.
4,battery,reliable battery. came in a decent time. it was needed for a security system and had to be reliable. It seems to be working just fine.
1,What?,"Horrible film! Disjointed, incomprehensible. I have no idea who people were, what they were doing and saying, or why. Worse, the main character is as flat, mute and unsympathetic at the end as at the beginning. Who was his son? Who got killed at the beginning of the film and why? Forget it, I don't care. I process fictional films as stories, and, for me, if there's no story, there's no film... Beautiful cinematography though.And why not do something interesting with Beatrice Dalle if you're going to have her in the film?"
1,The Intruder,"This film was one of the worst we have ever seen. Pretentious to an extreme. New style of filmmaking? Forget it. Did the film makers write character names,p laces and events at random on 3x5 cards and then throw them into a blender called a camera? The sound track? Ominous, brooding and boring. When you watch a film aren't you supposed to care about something in it? A confetti of shreds. Watch only if you need sleep and films do that to you.S. MacMillan"
1,A Bad Acid Trip.....,"I will agree that the cinematography is beautiful, but the story is very difficult to follow. Perhaps I should have read the thirty page book this movie is supposedly based on before purchasing the DVD. The movie seems disjointed and surreal at times. I am not sure how to put the pieces of this puzzle together. I have more questions about this film than answers. Even the interview with the producer, Claire Denis, is cryptic."
1,The worst Hiroshima release.,In general I love Hiroshima. This album is a great disappointment. My local record store gave me their promo copy (when it was a new release) and did not recommend it for purchase. If you are a die hard Hiroshima fan (as I am) it may be worth the price for the couple of good tracks on the CD.
4,The Books of Magic without all the magic,"This fabulous edition of the books of magic is less than I expected from a paperback version. Why you ask? Simple, in my country this version was released a few years ago, but was out of print. In this issue there was more extras on the issue, besides the comic itself. The lack of such content left me slightly dissatisfied.Only the books of magic are books of magic, and even these small problems do not desmerit this issue that leads us to discover this world of aspiring young archmage Timothy Hunter. Come with Tim over the years, worlds and beyond to know what is best in the mystical side of Vertigo."
4,"Great story, marred only by odd references","This is another one of Gaiman's wonderful story lines. Imaginative, brilliant graphics, and a plot that is far greater than anything Ive seen in a while. The only problem is the DC Universe references that I dont get since I dont normally read many comics."
5,Gaiman's bittersweet best,"I can't believe I'd never read the original miniseries before. (Although I've certainly enjoyed the ongoing series).Despite the age, The Books of Magic doesn't feel dated at all and maintains the uniquely bittersweet, fairy tale tone that is characteristic of Gaiman at his best.This looks like it was a lot of fun for the artists as well, who were each very well-chosen.I certainly wouldn't mind an annotated copy - especially for the final chapter. Despite being familiar with most of the DC and Sandman mythos, there were still bits that went completely over my head, and names that merely rung bells, when I suspect that they needed to have more meaning.Despite that, there's a lot in here than even a newcomer to comics could appreciate - this would be a terrific gateway comic to lure your friends into the world of colourful geekery."
2,Poor Price/Performance Ratio,"I have just written my thesis paper on ASPs and know that there is little good literature on the topic. Therefore, I was willing to pay a bit more for one of the few books that is out on the market. In this case this is a big mistake. The promising title does not reveal the actual content of the book. The author only touches the ASP topic and does not really present more than the basics.I can advise people to buy this book if they are looking for easy literature. For serious academic or business papers it is really not suited."
5,A Very Nice Glove,"This too, is a very nice glove. These gloves are light and very nice in using in church service, whether using them in church dance ministry, ushering or communion service. Gloves of thicker fabrics, make it difficult to pickup a small communion cup, but with this type of glove, picking up a communion cup is less cumbersome."
1,Product did not fit,This filter is about 2 inches smaller. Apparently during the 2010 Acura MDX model year they changed the filter holder size and thus the filter. If you check the fram site you will find that they list a different filter for the 2010 MDX. I buy my filters in advance of when I plan to install them so by the time I found out that the size was wrong (even though it was their error) they would not accept a return.
2,"It could be worse, one supposes","But that isn't really much of a compliment. This book is replete with errors, and is outdated. However, if you are looking for a merely entertaining introduction to Egyptian literature, then this will do. I would recommend William K. Simpson and R.O. Faulkner's ""The Literature of Ancient Egypt : An Anthology of Stories, Instructions and Poetry"" for a more accurate and readable text."
5,Perfect for Greasy Hands,"I looked for these clear plastic page holders so that I could use them for my tractor manual. The tractor is 30-years old - as is the manual and fairly hard to find nowadays - and needs a lot of care so I regularly spend time maintaining the engine as well as lubing the chassis, etc. Anyway, I found the best way to work on the tractor and use the manual without gumming up the pages so badly that they are unreadable is to put the individual 3-ring manual pages into these plastic sheets and then to only take out the sheets I need to work on the tractor. If I get the plasic sheets smudged or dirty they wipe up easily and the tractor pages stay clean. The plastic page holders were inexpensive and I received them quickly. Perfect solution to a messy problem."
5,The ONLY way to store full size photos,"My local Staples doesn't carry these any more, and their store-brand substitute just doesn't measure up. The Avery product is crystal clear, and the slightly larger than 8.5x11"" size makes it easy to insert two photos back-to-back."
5,Great for all document storage !,"I have been using this sort of sheet protector for years, it was great to find them on Amazon rather than having to drag to an office supply store."
3,"Get loud, get it loud, loud .","This was the fourth album by the reclusive Jandek. It was his first album to employ outside performers. Most of the tracks just feature Jandek and his guitar, but there a couple of songs that feature bass and drums as well. But the most noteable change on this album is the appearance of a female singer on ""Nancy Sings"". ""Nancy"" actually has a nice, ethereal singing voice, which makes ""Nancy Sings"" one of Jandek's most accessible songs. ""Nancy"" also appears on ""No Break"", which is an apparently ad-libbed jam, and is not very accessible. Like every other Jandek album, this will only appeal to a small percentage of people."
5,Great Protection,"You never know when you might need protection for certain items, and I believe in having additional protection for electronic items like DVD players. I hope I don't have to use it, but I am so glad I purchased it anyway."
4,A brief introduction to a little-known subject.,"A very thought provoking analysis of a very misunderstood subject. Totman credentials are beyond reproof, he spent a long time in Thailand doing the primary research. What he explains is that Kathoeys or Ladyboys are not homosexual, but are essentially women born in men's bodies. Their visiblity in Thai society seems to have more to do with the liberal and tolerant attitude of the place rather than other reasons such as some genetic peculiarity, which implies they should be as prevalent across the rest of the world, but hide themselves from view. It would have been good to have more insight into how Ladyboys feel about their position, and how they feel about their sexuality vis-a-vis the men they desire. A good introduction, I look foward to the upcoming book by Pornchai Sereemongkonpol on the same subject."
3,Dry Reading,"This book was written by, I believe, a nonfiction journalist, and it shows. It reads like a textbook, and I found it to be rather dry. Even though the copyright is 2004, it has the feel of something that came from the 70s.If you're looking for info about kathoey/katoey, I highly recommend Ladyboys: The Secret World of Thailand's Third Gender by Pornchai Sereemongkonpol and Susan Aldous. The personal accounts of the laydboys detailed therein are written in a more realistic and entertaining manner."
4,"Good Baker, but not great Baker","I'm glad other reviewers enjoyed this book, and after reading it I still have much respect for Baker's introspective and experimental way of writing. The earlier review that listed a series of choice nuggets from this book made me smile; they're all very fine.On the other hand, I really hope that readers who enjoyed this book will give a try to _The Mezzanine_ if they haven't already. It's the same kind of fictional experiment as _A Book of Matches_, but written by a younger Baker, who was prone to fits of enthusiasm that seemed slightly naive but were also lots of fun for the reader, and very funny as well. The nutty, over-the-top quality that inspired _The Mezzanine_ is missing in this work."
3,Bellybutton lint,"I was intrigued by the idea of a book about the minutae and contemplations of a man building a fire in the fireplace before dawn each morning. However, I was disappointed by all the fluff, like the bellybutton lint he discusses, and lack of substance. He mentions his son, his daughter, and his wife, as well as his pet duck, but despite a few personal anecdotes, they remain strangers thoughout the book. I was never able to feel like I was in the man's head, vicariously enjoying his musings.Great concept for a book, poor execution, I'm afraid to say.The short chapters made for ideal subway reading. :-)"
2,A disappointment,"Some small things really are meaningful, and astute observations of them are indeed wise and a delight to read. But most of the small things observed in this book really have very little, if any meaning at all, and while familiar, have no resonance. Written with a nice touch, but slight in every way."
3,An Amazing Amount of Detail,"I thought the novel was very well written. There was an enormous amount of detail, including lots of metaphors. The framing of the novel-that is, the use of a box of matches to set the plot-was unusual, but interesting. The narrator, Emmett was full of advice, and it was easy to relate to him. I could understand the things he was saying, such as biting into an apple to hard, and how he was feeling during his sickness. The book kept me hooked until the end, it was fun and easy to read."
5,Beautiful short book,"A great, great novel.Less overtly ""clever"" than Baker's earlier books, this tribute to life, children, pets, and middle age, is one of his absolute best. More subtle, wise, and humble.Great read."
2,Plotless,"This book is finely written and contains many endearing observations on marriage and family, and ends on a sweet note. Yet it is also quite dull and nearly plotless--the chapters could be pretty much thrown into the air and rearranged at random without any effect on the logical progression or cumulative emotional power of the book."
1,Nicholson Baker is a pathetic human being,"The world is full of whiners, and this guy is the king. As a pup, Nicholson Baker attended the School Without Walls where, ""learning has no limit."" Unfortunately for us, the only message he got resulted in his permanent low self-image.If you purchase ANY of this poor misbegotten soul's books, you are doing nothing more than feeding the mouth of a permanent pessimist.Nicholson, we're praying for you and your children."
4,"Easy Going,Sometimes Humorous Book","Through fire after fire,coffee making and waking up,you get segments of Emmetts life and details of things you do but never really think about.(This book may help you from now on to do so.)There was nothing really exciting in this book but the details in it keep you wandering onto the next page wondering what he will analyze next.I myself enjoy books that I really do not have to concentrate on to be able to keep track of who is who and whats what,(like when Im chasing two kids around my livingroom with my eyes every 2 seconds)I can look back down and still know whats going on.This is a book like that.Good read."
2,Seems written by someone trying to imitate Nicholson Baker's style,"I have read many of N.B.'s novels and essays, and he is a favorite author of mine. This novel, however, seems more like it was written by someone else in his writing style, rather than written by Baker himself. It lacks the substantive punch of his earlier works, lacks the beauty and emotion of a narrator relating to others in his world. The pet duck in the story seems more real, compelling, and finely drawn than the narrator's wife and children. (Maybe this is intentional?) In addition, whereas past Baker narrators have described the minutiae of their lives with freshness and wonder, this narrator gets pedantic. Does the reader really need to be told how a rear-window defroster works, or how to wash a dish? I think for Baker fans, this might be a disappointment. For a first-time Baker reader, however, it's a peaceful little book that might lead to his better ones."
4,"An Easy, Enjoyable Read","This book is for fans of The Mezzanine or Room Temperature, a story about nothing and everything. A book with no real plot but plenty of story. While I agree with an earlier review that reading this book is like reading somebody's writing exercises, Nicholson Baker is one author who probably journals more entertaining stuff than most writers' published fiction. These stories are random and entertaining, with exquisite details and wordplay that makes the writer in you sigh in jealous resignation. I gave it four stars because it was a little uneven, and some stories were much better than others.Be assured however, that Nicholson Baker's creative gazebo always has a great band. I recommend a listen."
4,Works Fine,"I only paid $10.90 for this item, it was the cheapest keyboard/opt. mouse bundle I found sold through Amazon.com. It was well worth that price. It's your standard keyboard and mouse. The keys feel fine and the scroll wheel on the mouse doesn't stick. My only real complain is that the cable on the mouse is a little stiff, although I think this stiffness may wear out after some use. The CD it came with has installation software/drivers for Windows 98SE/2000/ME/XP. Windows Vista was able to install drivers for the devices using 'plug & play' and I was able to find Windows Vista software/drivers on the KeyTronics website. The software is necessary if you want the media keys to function. It's a decent item, but had I been trying to buy a quality keyboard/mouse I would have more likely purchased a Logitech item."
3,OK kit but could be better,"OK kit if the upper and lower plastic pump housings are in good shape. Regardless of this, even the full kit which includes new housings does not include two very important seals that reside under the pump. These two oils seals stop any water from entering the gear case and are so stupid-easy to replace while installing this kit, that (in my opinion) they should have been included..."
5,Good kit!,"This impeller kit provides everything the DIY mechanic requires to complete the job. The quality of the parts is excellent. The only items not included are the pump housing which is replaced on condition, and the gear case oil. Good Deal! Recommend!"
4,"Debbie, Sonoma,CA","I love this lamp, however, it is not blue and white, or blue and yellow as shown in the picture. It is brown with black chinese writing on it. I found a spot for it anyway in our home. The shade was too big for the lamp, so I replaced it. It is a pretty little piece however."
4,Unexpectedly Good!,"I really enjoy ""old school"" gospel DVD's & I search the web for them all the time. I am a fan of ""Slim"" & the Supreme Angels but, some of my recent purchases of artist that I enjoy have not lived up to my expectations. However, this one broke the cycle & came through in a big way! I watch it & sign along all the time. Even my daughter signs along & she is only 2 years old!!"
5,Supreme Supremes,"Slim & the Supreme Angels are my favorite gospel group; as always, they deliver spirit-filled songs and highest praise. Michael Richardson is the BOMB Bassist!"
2,"Interesting, but ultimately not useful enough","Although this book is interesting, I have been very disappointed by it.The printing quality is very low, printed on crappy paper and only in black and white. it looks like it has been photocopied on a low quality photocopier. I would expect a lot better for a $140 textbook. Printing quality aside, the book, although well written has very little use for machine design and many other areas, often missing critical features. I understand that it is only meant as a quick guide, but it does not have nearly enough detail to solve practical problems.It may have been a good book to have during uni as a quick low level learning tool, solving purely theoretical problems, but in real world situations it does not suffice."
1,Full of inaccuracies and stereotypes,"I was very disappointed by this book, and if I were Native American, I might even be offended by it. The book attempts to generalize too much about a very diverse group of tribes and native groups, and it conflates time so much that it isn't always clear what happened prehistorically, what happened at contact, and what is true today. Many of the comments about Native Americans play to stereotypes (scalping is implied to be universal, for instance), and there are a few details that are just plain wrong (corn and maize listed as separate foodstuffs). I suggest you look elsewhere if you want a factual and sensitive treatment of this subject."
5,Everyone needs a little Pucho!,Mix a little Willie Bobo with some James Brown and add a wee bit of Cubanismo with some garnishes of Soul and Mambo and you will be getting close to Pucho. A must have CD for any collection. Pucho will keep you moving.
4,Recommended,"One of Pucho's better efforts. ""Ritmo Nueva York"", a rare vocal number, is the highpoint."
5,I COULDN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN...........,"I thought this was one of Ann Carberry's best books ever. Not only did Micah Beenten and Julietta Duffy have magic together page after page , while reading you almost felt like you were right there with them.........THIS IS A MUST READ!! also you'll have to read about Micah's little sister and her love in the first to this short series..SHOTGUN BRIDE... I wish Ann Carberry wrote books on the remaining single brothers. DJW~"
1,#2 in the WILDFLOWER ROMANCE,"#2 to SHOTGUN BRIDE -- Not the same verve as the first but a great follow up to Hallie's story.Micah Benteen is asked to find the stubborn girl who was fleeing her wedding -- He captured her in Montana and must transport her back to Texas. But Julietta was prepared to fight to escape until an unexpected kiss turned them from enemies into partners.Fortunately there were many miles and a few interupptions to change the emotional balances. More passion and action.Whoaaa, Don Vincente Alveraz, waiting for Julietta was another matter. The story gets better and better.Definitely Recommended -- worth reading again"
5,Excellent and Well Worth IT!!!!,"I loved the drills, the names of the yoga moves, and everything else about this dvd. I did not see anything negative about this dvd. No matter whether you are a student or instructor; of belly dance, or any other form of dancing, these isolations and drills can add to your stamina. I also felt the difference, as was mentioned in another post. This is a great companion for your warm-ups and to strenghten your muscles. The isolations are fantastic. Thanxxx Rachel!!!! I love watching you dance!!!!!!Tha Raven"
5,A wonderful dvd,"I have been doing yoga for over 2 years and have tried almost every yoga dvd out there, but this dvd really left an impression on me.Rachel gives clear, effective instructions that really help you to understand how to do the drills. She explains which muscles to contract, when to breathe, and how the body should be positioned. She also tells you what parts of the body should NOT be used in each drill, which I think is important to correctly learn the drills.This dvd combined yoga and bellydancing to give a nice variation to the workout that most dvds dont have. Its a tough workout, but it really shapes youre stomach. I noticed a difference in my waist in just a few weeks.I would deffinetly recommend this to anyone interested in either bellydancing or yoga. Brice did a wonderful job, I hope to see a sequel to this."
3,Not what I thought,"I bought this DVD and I wasn't very impressed. I was excited for a mix of yoga and bellydance because I haven't done any bellydance before. The drills were good and I could feel them working muscles, but I didnt like the format of the it. There were breaks with the titles between each move, which is educational, but interrupts the flow of the DVD. Its a good DVD if you just want to learn and practice basic movements, but it left me wanting more. Maybe I just need to try the other DVDs to get combinations and stuff."
2,Just okay,I love Rachael Brice and thinks she is one of the very best fusion belly dancers. However this video she is very disconnected to the audience. Not only that it lacks a varity of creative moves. It seems as though she is not a very good teacher or she doesn't want to reveal a lot of what she knows. This video is for someone that want to learn a little something. Not for those who want to persue fusion belly dance or take it on as a hobbie.
3,Not easy......,She goes slow but is very difficult. I still have not been able to go through the entire dvd after 1 month.
3,Different...,"This tape has a good yoga workout on it, as for the belly dancing, the slow tribal dance is harder than it looks."
5,Great for beginners and pros alike!,I love the way the moves are broken down piece by piece. Very easy to follow!
3,Too much yoga!,This had the chance of being a great instructional video. The girl who does the instruction has great moves! But over half of the video was spent on doing yoga (before and after the bellydance moves). They should have spent the yoga time on the bellydance moves. Their instruction was great but not enough time was spent on each move.
4,Tribal Fusion Belly Dance,"Rachel is truly amazing & mesmerizing to watch. The instruction part of the dvd was very clear & easy to understand. However, I didn't like the way the performance part of the the dvd edited. It was too MTV style, a million edits & all I wanted the camera to do was stay more focused on her instead of cutting in & out at the speed of light! She's the star... not the editor!"
5,it delivers,"it delivers exactly what it says it will - a workout of drills and some yoga. Excellent demonstration and explanation of the elements and a very good workout to learn and remember basic forms.This is not a dance video (and it makes that very clear in it's title).Rachel Brice is a delight to follow along, good voice and wonderful body and she's not annoying in that smily perky cheerleader way that many videos are.I like it a lot and it gets used at least three times a week and for form checks whenever I want a clarification."
2,Not very inspiring!,"Well... it's a pretty, if occasionally weirdly shot, video. Like many other reviewers, I agree that this one is a nice little extra thing to do outside of class or in tandem with other workouts. Rachel is an amazing dancer & I am a fangirl, but sometimes the best need to coordinate their creative teaching energies with a writer/director who knows how to communicate physical techniques to the masses (specialized though we may be) and can more appropriately guide the gaze of the videographer."
5,Wonderful video for Beginner-Intermediate daily warm up!,"Its nice to have a Yoga video in my collection that deals with the poses best for bellydancing! The dance moves are geared to beginners and for intermediate dancer who really wants to *feel* the movement they are doing. She does the hip lifts a little different than I learned (no foot lifting) them so its nice to switch it up a bit. Also I think the performance peice at the end was wonderful, the camera does go with the music BUT I would like the option of seeing just one full shot of the performance as well. I really want to see where your feet are when you drop to the floor! SO all in all I have recommended it to my friends and I have been working with this video for a week (since I got it) and I'm getting my mom to try it out with me too. This video leaves me Hungry for more Rachel!!"
4,Great Isolations for BellyDance,"For those who do belly dance and would like to gain better control of their body, this DVD is great. It has isolations for the major moves (chest drops, hip drops, undulations) and some yoga to improve flexibility. Rachel Brice does an excellent job of demonstrating each move. Her body is in unbelievable shape so you can see exactly what groups of muscles to use. There is also a performance of hers, with crazy camera work, but still fun to watch her."
3,Disappointed when bought for dance.,"I am a huge Rachel Brice fan, but was disappointed in this DVD. While great for the yoga aspect, and the division into 15, 30, and 45 minute workouts is good, if you are looking to learn her amazing hip lock combinations or Turkish drops, you are best off taking her workshops. The DVD addresses basics that could be learned on other DVD's (Not being a Neena/Veena fan, I'm referring to BellyQueen, et.al.). Nice addition to a collection, but not a mandatory. Take her workshops instead."
4,Good but I want more....,I really like the idea of combining bellydance with yoga. I think they complement each other.I liked this DVD a lot. I did the 45 minute workout and it was great only one complain though it is too short I did not feel like I got a good yoga or bellydance practice. Other than that it was good I will use it on those days when I don't feel like doing much.
5,Rockin' DVD,"I really got a feel for some of Rachel's more difficul moves, like the body roll that I thought was just a stomach role. I also love the different practice lengths, for those lazy days. The DVD is not all that difficult, but it's like practicing with a friend around to keep you going."
3,meh,great dvd for beginners... but i found it didn't have a lot of drills.. defiantly could have had more to it as far as ATS goes
5,Fabulous,"If you want to learn how to reach those really hard to reach places in belly dance, this is the dvd for you! Not only does it take you on a drill adventure, but it also aids in the mind-body connection through yoga which is so intrinsic to dance and to really getting intuned with one's body. This DVD is truly worth it and great to do several times a week!"
3,Reasonably All Right,"The exercise porton was pretty good, though a little advanced for anyone who hasn't done yoga before. The disappointing part was the dance routine - the camerawork was choppy and abrupt, and the props kept getting in the way of what was otherwise an intriguing dance (In other words, I wanted to see the dancer, not the candelabra blocking the dancer.)."
2,No Tribal Instruction,"If you want to learn Tribal Bellydance, this isn't the DVD from which to learn.If you want tribal ""versions"" of very basic classic belly dance moves, this will work.You are given ~7 moves: chest lifts/drops, hip circles, undulations, hip lifts/drops, chest 8s.I already know those foundation moves, teach something I don't know.ALSO!! There is waaaay too much yoga in this DVD. I expected yoga warmups from the description...but almost the entire DVD is yoga. You get yoga intro, a few moves, and a yoga ending. This is in every ""option"" you have (either 15min, 30min, or 45min). You don't get too many more moves...just more yoga.And somebody needs to tell whoever records/edits the BD superstar videos to actually video the dancer...not their feet, hands, belly button...their whole body moves! We need to see their whole body and their whole dance!"
4,Great for Beginners/Intermediates,"I love Rachel Brice - she is one of my favorite bellydancers. This video is great, but wasn't really ideal for me personally. I'm not a huge Yoga fan (way too impatient!) and a lot of time is devoted to that. The drills and isolations are awesome and I frequently use this DVD as a reference because Rachel does a great job explaining everything. I have been bellydancing for about 2 1/2 years and I teach a beginner bellydance class, so for me this DVD was too basic. If you are a beginner/intermediate this would be a great addition to your collection! If you are advanced, I would say rent it first before you buy it."
1,Brice not the best,"I don't know what it was about this DVD but I just didn't like it. It could just be the sinuous nature of the dancer herself. I know bellydancers that swear by her, but I didn't find the instruction that overwhelmingly educational. The extras- that included a performance were defintely the highlight of the video, kind of like watching a train wreck - I just am not moved by skeletal types though, I prefer to see women more like myself dancing."
1,Bellydancing or Gothic Dancing?,"After watching this DVD one time (and I had to force myself to watch it all)I must say I was not happy with this DVD. I own over a 2 dozen Bellydancing Videos and out of all of them, I have only gotten rid of 2, one was to Nasty, and This one. Which is very Gothic and not what I like. I showed my copy to my Tribe and none of them liked it either. Sorry Rachel."
2,Too Skinny!,"It was tough to watch the rail thin belly dancer! She was a great dancer but difficult to follow because she is too advanced! I have seen tribal/fusion dancers & they are women with bodies, not skeletons!"
5,Interesting and feel good,Postures of belly dance could be more easily grasped with very detailed explanation and very good demo. And I like very much this form to combine yoga sun solute with belly dance.
2,Better for those who are more advanced,"I love and admire Rachel Brice's abilities, however, this is DEFINITELY NOT FOR BEGINNERS. Had I been able to keep up, it would've been great. But, as I am just a beginner and have never been shown how to do the moves, it would've been nice if she had gone slower and explained each move in more detail."
3,Worth it just to see her dance!,"Tribal Fusion/Yoga Isolations & Drills for Belly Dance...that is EXACTLY what you are getting. The instruction can be tailored to a time schedule: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or 45 minutes. You will get a yoga warm-up of sun salutations with lunges to help open up the hips. Then, you will get a series of isolations for the chest, hips, and stomach. Finally, you will get a brief yoga cool-down. Oh yeah, you also get a stunning classic Rachel Brice performance decked-out in all her ATS fusion glory! THAT is really what you're paying for, here, people!"
4,"More advertisment, less video.","First off I should say that I absolutely LOVED the video. I loved how it started off with the Yoga to stretch you out..and then works on the drills - which always gets me wanting to dance. I love the way it's got different workout times as well. But, my only problem with this video...On the back of the dvd case..it says 3/4 shimmy preparation and Maya and Taxim..and it didn't cover either one. It was no where on the dvd. I also didn't like the fact that they have locks on the down on the 30 minute workout and not on the 45...what gives? Did they not pay attention when they made the dvd? Either way..it's great for isolation drills...I've notice a HUGE difference in my dancing and it definitely helped me out. Great video! (Although I wish there was a little less yoga and more on the drills."
2,Dull and repetitive,"I was looking forward to receiving this DVD based on the other reviews, but I was disappointed. While the quality of the video is good, the narration is clear, helpful, and intuitive, and I liked that she did the moves in front of a mirror so you can see all sides, I found it overall to be extremely dull and repetitive, just the same old things over and over.Her performance is interesting and her technique is flawless, but there is only one short performance segment. I would have liked to have seen more.I might pull this DVD out again and try to emulate some of her moves, but this DVD seems to be more for the yoga enthusiast than a belly dancer."
4,wow what a work out!!,if you wount to improve your fitness and enjoy bellydancing this dvd should be addid to your colectlon.
2,A little too Goth for me,This video was rather Goth and the moves and drills didn't really feel like bellydance to me.
5,Perfect Daily Routine,"I use this DVD every day, a lot of the basic yoga postures and Belly/Hip/Chest Isolations and Drills. I love it. Always helps me stretch out and break a sweat."
5,rachel brice yoga for tribal fusion dance,"great dvd by rachel brice with lots of great ab work, delivered in great condition and so quickly, i am a permanent fan of amazons' music and teaching dvds on bellydance, gypsy."
5,Solid drills,"I took Rachel's workshop in Asheville, NC and recommend a workshop over this DVD. On the other hand, the DVD lets you study Rachel's moves up close, which is priceless.I wish it were longer. I'd love her workshop on DVD. And I'd love more emphasis on her amazing pops and locks. I'm getting a copy of Serpentine as soon as possible :)"
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I am a little disappointed at what I got. from the entire CD the onlything I enjoyed was the ""step by step"" 15 minutes dedicated to those who want to learn to belly dance, the rest of the CD was about Rachel Brice talking, yak yak yak, then more commercials on other CDs. I would have liked to have more of the Step by Step instructions."
3,"alright, but...","Ok, I have mixed emotions about this dvd. I love that you can choose which work out to do depending on how much time you have or what you're up to doing, I have yet to come across another dvd that does that. However, there is a LOT of yoga and I get bored of it easily, but it's good for me so I shouldn't complain. The lack of moves covered is also an issue and the thing that bugs the heck out of me is that everything she does seems to be arrhythmic like they added in the drum beat with the voice over. Overall it's an alright dvd but I believe there are much better out there that I would rather spend my money on."
3,Camera needs work,"I loved the dance performance (although short), but the camera work made it hard to watch the moves. It seemed to interfere with the performance flow. The yoga session was informative, but made me feel this is not for beginners. Could have used someone else with her to show trying, but not achieving perfection."
2,Disappointing,"I am an advanced bellydancer and I love all dance styles. I was amazed by Rachel's performance in the Bellydance Superstars video and I ordered immediately her DVD. I hoped to learn the secrets of her incredible flexibility, which I partly did. But still the DVD has a very poor content, very few yoga and dance movements are shown and, I regret to say this, but the performance is ugly. I gave it two stars though, because the movements are perfectly broken down by Rachel and the position of the body is always the correct one, which is very rare in such DVDs."
2,Don't bother,"I usually only review DVDs I really love, but felt I had to say something about this one, seeing as I bought it after reading the spotlight review ""I'd give it more stars if I could!!""I watched the intro and it looked so promising - Rachel is an amazing dancer and her yoga form is good - and I loved the idea of having 15, 30 and 45 minute workouts. Alas, there was little substance to the actual workouts. Even the 45 minute practice was dreary and disjointed - a couple of yoga poses (sun salutations with lunge - very hard the way Rachel does them, then straight into locust pose), a few bellydance drills and then a couple of yoga stretches at the end. In the intro, Rachel is shown doing pigeon pose, bow pose and another backbend. Where were these in the workouts? I can only assume she had little editorial control over this DVD."
1,yoga or bellydance,"I bought this dvd for the yoga as well as the drills - i know what drills are and that is what I wanted. The blurb says for any level of dance student. However, I fond the yoga impossible (I could manage corpse position!) It's certainly not for anyone who hasn't done yoga before. The drills are good but you don't get much for your money as each section is the same as before and timings include yoga. Beginners should buy Jenna Bellydance Basics and beyond for drills and instruction. More advance students might want more content."
4,Very inspiring,The disk contains 3 beginner/intermediate level yoga and some belly dance drills plus a performance. Workouts are very similar. Rachel Brice's performance is amazing. I don't think one could easily learn it but I wish she broke it down.
5,Belly Dance is in my blood,"My mother was a cabaret dancer in Greece during the late 70's and early 80's. I grew up watching and learning all of the fabulous techniques. Today, belly dance in America is very different but equally as amazing as the old style. Mom loves this DVD so much she said I had to have it. I am generally put off by yoga but Ms. Brice puts a whole new spin on it. The fusion between yoga and raks actually makes this type exercise fun. Yoga is hard work, but if you love to belly dance, this DVD will open up a whole new world of technique to you."
5,Finally! Proper technique!,"After having watched about 21 bellydance instructional dvd's of all types, I was thrilled to find this one. Rachel shows proper technique on both yoga and bellydance drills - this is very important and very rare in the instructional bellydance (and yoga) dvd realm. New students to yoga and bellydance buy other dvd's and have no idea they are being taught improper technique that will lead to physical problems. It is great to see Rachel knows her stuff and shares the knowledge she has gathered. Her voice is calm and supportive, her instruction is clear. I certainly hope she will make another dvd with tribal fusion instruction - she is a great teacher."
2,Broke within days,"Easy to install; protects the LCD display; shades the LCD in the sun; what could be better? Oh, I don't know; maybe not having one of the little plastic tabs that holds it on not to break after just a few days. Maybe, I dropped it or something so I am not giving this a 1 star, but buyers be aware that it is fairly fragile."
2,Not very good for DSLRs,"I tried one on my Canon 7D DSLR camera. I found it a hassle to have to keep closing the hood to use the optical viewfinder and open it to check results. So I tried to remove the hood from the mounting bracket, but instead it pulled the adhesive mount off the LCD screen. It ended up tossed in the junk pocket of my camera bag. I haven't tried to mount it again. I consider it a failed experiment. Sure it would work okay with a point and shoot camera with no optical viewfinder. It opens and closes pretty quickly, and easily enough if you don't have to do it for every shot, or group of shots. For a DSLR it's just too much hassle."
1,Not for Panasonic LX5,"I purchased this product based on Amazon's ""what others also purchase"" recommendation for the LX5 but it is too narrow for the LX5 and too large in the vertical dimension so the adhesive area extends over the edges and past the bottom of the camera because it is limited on the top by the presence of the hot shoe and accessory port cover. The product looks like it would work OK in the right application but I gave it one star to call attention to the review and maybe save other LX5 owners the hassle of purchasing the wrong product."
4,Some help in reducing glare.,I bought this product for my Nikon CoolPix P7000. It's the best thing I've found in reducing sunlight glare. I said reducing not removing. It works pretty well & is a snap to install.
3,Great for sun glare:),"Both my mom and I have these and when we first got them we loved the fact that it protects our viewing screen and makes it easier for us to view pix outside when there's sun glare. However the more we open and close it to view the photos both have broken. My flip up part and side parts have all fallen off so I have just kept the protective screen on since it's already on and one of the side parts has broken on my moms. Needless to say it's purpose is there, but it's cheaply made."
4,DOES NOT DO EVERYTHING I THOUGHT IT WOULD,"IT DOES NOT KEEP THE LED FUNCTIONING WELL IN ALL SUN POSISTIONS. STILL HAVE DIFICULTY WITH BRIGHT SUNLIGHT READING THE LED. BETTER THEN WITHOUT ANYTHING.YOU HAVE THE WRONG NAME ON THIS REVIEW. MY WIFE, JOAN EISENSTEIN, HAS BEEN DECEASED FOR SIX YEARS. LEONARD EISENSEIN IS THE WRITER AND PURCHASER OF THIS REVIEW."
1,Waste of money.,"Waste of money. I saw no improvement whatsoever in regards to reflections. I still can't see my subject in daylight, and I don't mean bright sunlight only. Even overcast, it's worthless. I've stopped using live view altogether, and depend solely on my eyepiece."
3,"Shade for 3"" camera LCD",Easy to install but the built in plastic screen would work better if it were a matte plastic screen. You can see your own reflection in it in bright sunlight.
2,Not All That,Didn't do it for me. The reflection caused by the plastic lens more than offsets any advantage created by the pop up shade. When the camera is used on a tripod my had worked better than this thing.
2,Delkin DU3. 0-M Universal Pop-up Shade 3.0 Inch,I used it on my SLR camera. When I went to open up the pop-upshade it broke.I bought PKG deal of 2 for the price I dont feel it Is worththe money. Need to make the shade stronger.
3,The Delkin pop-up shade solves a problem of invisible image on LCD in bright sun.,"I chose this because my Canon Sp5 has no viewfinder and LCD is virtually useless in bright sun. This is a good work around under sunny condition. However, the pop-up shade does appear to be a bit on the fragile side."
3,shade,Didn't seem to help much with our Sony. We tried it on a long trip and ended up not using it much.
2,Not compatible with the NEX,"I bought it for my NEX-3 and it is no good. First of all it doesn't attach, it adheres through some type of sticky tape. Secondly it does not cover the entire screen; it chops a small part of the screen. Lastly the hood does little to provide shade. I'm still searching for the perfect screen protector, hood, or anything that will compensate for the lack of viewfinder on the NEX-3."
2,doesn't really work,"While the pop-up shade fits the camera nicely and blends right in, it doesn't do any better against the summer glare than not having a shade."
2,lose-win kinda,"They don't stay on. you cant close your viewfinder anymore (duh) and they really don't block the sun that much. you figure the sun is going to be behind you when you are shooting, if you are lucky and it will still hit the LCD. its only 2.5-3.5 inches.update here March 2010. I did find some benefit of this hood cover.I still use it on my Sony HC9. its not bulky like the Petrol brand, however they dont block as much sun either. depending on what color your camera is, just take a small strip of 100mile and hour tape and run it n the back of the LCD vertical ways. Just dont tape the cover shut. This will keep the cover on. The tape wont leave a residue. You can leave the cover on it permanently if you like and just flip the LCD reversed to close it."
4,Great Book for Hypoglycemia,"This is an excellent diet for those with hypoglycemia. The food restrictions for those with candidiasis and hypoglycemia are nearly identical - avoidance of all sugar and sugar-producing substances.It is my belief that the principles in this book, if followed, will bring about the best health anyone with low blood sugar has ever experienced. Donna addresses internal healing and cleansing. The pancreas and liver are usually in really bad shape when a hypoglycemics' diet has not been under control. Following the diet will eliminate those powerful sugar cravings and keep the blood sugar in balance, while giving the body a rest so it can heal itself.The principles may be new to some, but they are worth the effort of incorporating into your diet. The question is: How badly do you want to feel well?"
5,Candida lifesaver,The book has great information and it's broken down very well both in chapters and quick reference paragraphs. A must read for candida and other general good health information.
2,Where's the Science?,"I am an avid fan of health books but found this one lacking. Donna's use of expanding, contracting, hot, cold, just wasn't based in reality enough for me. Sorry.There is a very good section on fermenting your own foods and on kefir, which is good. However, this is nothing that you couldn't read in Nourishing Traditions or other good nutrition books."
1,very bad,This product was realy bad beause the first time i wore them it ripped down the seam. I would not reccomend this product
3,"Seat, pedal",The seat is uncomfortable for me as I am skinny and have no natural padding my Son didn't seam to mind but he's heavier and has a little padding I bought this bike in 2009 and it held up well until just recently I came home one day and the Boy said the pedal had fallen off and he couldn't figure how to get it back on so I looked at it and discovered all the threads were missing not only from the pedal but from the lever as well. My son rode this bike every day for for one hour for the past year and before that I rode it twice a week for and hour. That adds up to slightly under five hundred hours of use. but for the price I guess it was worth it.
3,It works!,"Its an ugly little thing, but it works ... and has continued to work for over a year. The only reason I bought it is because I had so little room left on the stand that standard dvd player would not fit.PROS: Has all standard dvd features, long lastingCONS: Ugly, can't handle non standard formats (i.e. dvd-rw)"
4,Germany versus Russia in WWII.,"The main contention of Rees is that there was little difference between Stalin and Hitler. He is at least partially right. I believe Stalin was more irrational and murderous than Hilter, and the numbers support Stalin as being worse than Hitler. Mao was the worst. Anyway Rees contention is that Hitler waged war against the rest of the world while Stalin waged war against his own countrymen. The result was millions killed and rivers of blood. Along with this review of the two dictators, is the war that was waged on the Eastern Front for close to four years. It was waged against soldiers and civilians on both sides. The review has a good summary of the war with many great pictures.This is a good summary history and picture book. For those who are looking at a review of the war on the Eastern Front, this is a nice starting point."
5,"Barbarossa....deciding factors include ""General Winter""","Even with fore-warning J Stalin failed to take action,but weather was worst ever recorded.IF not for time lost, divergent encirclement battles, Moscow may have fallen. The T-34 tank came as a surprise..."
4,Good book for Spanish Speakers,"I read this book for a class I took in college, and am recommending that our department purchase this book for our Level 4 Spanish class. The book is easy to read and has a number of interesting conversation topics. The featured writers and the works in the book are very relevant to Latinos in the U.S. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Big Disappointment,"I hate to say this because I think Malcolm Bilson is an excellent pianist and I thoroughly enjoy and recommend his recording of the Mozart concertos with John Eliot Gardiner, but this CD was a big disappointment. Not because of Bilson's playing (which is very good) but for the awful recording quality of the CD. Sounds like they put the piano in a public restroom to record some of these sonatas. It has a very harsh ""small room"" reverberation that is very unappealing and uncomplimentary to the fortepiano (or any instrument!). Bilson deserves better enginneering than this. This would be a good CD if it were better recorded. Bilson's performance is fine , but the recording quality is unbearable. I recommend Melvyn Tan if you are looking for a good recording and performance of Beethoven sonatas on fortepiano."
4,A good start,"This is a good place to start to nurture an appreciation for the Fathers of the Church. With a delicate balance of appreciating our historical roots without jettisoning the present, Metropolitan Timiadis gives us a good push in the right direction. The Fathers have so much for us today but so often we assume their advice will be out of date and irrelevant to us today. Once we discover their classic advice, however, we may run the risk of deciding we no longer need to pursue later doctrines of the church in their fullest. This little book helps us find the necessary balance to neither worship nor ignore the ancient wisdom. Very well done."
5,A very relevant read!,"THis slim volume is a great place to start if you are beginning to read the fathers, and it is a perfect place for the experienced reader whole is interested in some topical discussions. The eleven topics include the themes of worship, how to treat those sepereated from teh church, who is a heretic, ecology and economy, wealth and love, the value of suffering etc. THis is an awesome book for its compact style and gems of wisdom and relevance.THis book makes a great gift as a devotional book as well. Not dry in the least!"
2,Fit,Did not fit very well and was extremely stiff. Eleven more words are required. Eleven more words are required. El
4,okay product,"These sheet protectors are not what I expected. The overlapping top is not as big as I thought it would be, just at 1 inch, but still useable. I don't think I would buy these again. Will look for something that better fits my needs/use for a product like this.They are good quality, just not exactly what I was looking for."
2,does not fit paper!,"Maybe I read the product wrong, but unless the paper already has 3 holes punched in it, it does not fit! So I now have to hole punch everything in order for these to work... extra work for me!"
2,not for sheet music,These sheet protectors do not work for sheet music. No one wants to put a 3-hole punch in the music.
2,Not so happy with the size,Simply inserting one sheet of paper into these sheet protectors was not easy. The one sheet bunches up because they were made too small. I didn't use them for the purpose I purchased them for because my sheets didn't fit well into them. I just use them to hold unimportant things like restaurant menus. Disappointed with the product.
2,Dissappointed,"I expected this book to give insights into Paul's letters. Instead, the book focuses on writing materials, etc. For example, there is a whole page devoted to whether or not people used writing desks or wrote on their laps."
3,Paddleboard or surfboard?,"Without the photo and without a more complete description, how do I know anything about the board's condition? Is it new or used? Are you referring to it as a ""paddleboard"" because it has handles, or is it thicker that the usual 9'0' BZ? These things I must know before I'll even consider making a purchase. Thanks!"
5,Lowest price around and lots of compliments,"Bought this as a lucky, mystery out of box find, yrs ago at a TJMaxx. Liked the scent and received compliments. Didn't find out it was for men until I ordered this bottle to give as a gift. Didn't have the heart to give it as a gift to my girlfriend but have no qualms about wearing it once again and enjoying the scent myself, if nothing else:-).This was the lowest price I found and the order and shipping all went smoothly."
5,I love this perfume,I have been using this perfume for a while now and really like it. The odor is not very heavy but you can still smell it late in the day which is always nice.
2,Classic example of vaporware and internet rumors,"Remember when this was to be sent July 2005 just prior to the 50th Anniversary? That date came and went. Then in September/October sources both here and elsewhere on the internet claimed December 2005, January at the latest. Then we get claims from January that it will be a couple of months at the latest. Tired of the rumors, I called Buena Vista Home Entertainment (the official source of the DVDs) and this item is no longer listed on their release calendar, although the CM indicated that they remembered it recently with a TBD release date.We can only guess why this has occured, and anything else is speculation. 2 stars, Disney's trouble with this disk is making hard-core fans unhappy. Right now you are better off with the Extinct Attractions Club."
5,While you wait!...,"While you wait, go to Extinct-attractions-club.com, they have the BEST Disney attraction DVDs ever made. I'm sure this DVD will be great, but those with an appetite for Disney's history, interviews with imagineers and old footage of classic attractions, will love the EAC noted above. Disney... hurry with this DVD! :)"
3,WHERE IS IT?,I've waited for this to be released for a couple of years now. WHERE IS IT????? WHY HASN'T IT BEEN RELEASED AFTER ALL THE ADVERTISING?
1,UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!,"Is this some kind of joke???? How can it possibly take 5 years to release a DVD that is allegedly already ready for release!!! We clearly all want it now so could you just hurry up and release it . If you seriously aren't going to release it til then, then you shouldn't have even bothered putting it on the site for another few years because it just teases us. I am not happy, please let us have this DVD!!!!!!!!"
4,The Story of Disneyland,"On a recent trip to Disneyland, I purchased a DVD with the 50th anniversay artwork on the front, thinking it was history of the park. Boy was I wrong. Do not buy the park DVD, instead wait for this one. The one currently selling at the park is nothing more than the travel video Diseny sends out as a promotional for the park. The DVD advertised as COMING SOON here is more along the lines of what I thought I was getting. Let's hope this DVD actually makes a debut sometime soon. How much longer can they hold out?"
5,Quintessential Roosevelt,"This volume will be enjoyable to anyone who loves nature or reading about nature; it will also interest the hunter and naturalist. See the events that help shape the life the greatest president this country has ever seen. A true conservationist, Mr. Rooselvelt was a REAL nature lover - his opinions were shaped through personal experience.The two books in this volume are highly recommended."
1,Disappointed,"Way too small for a Homecare Nurse, very disappointing,I gave it as a gift, based on the reviews, looked like it would work out, not the case. Would not recommend for nursing, maybe a diaper bag."
4,Does the job,"It's a decent bag for medical students. Keeps things organized and protected. Quality built isn't the best, but can't beat the $30 price."
3,Smaller than expected,"Has the pockets it said it did, small though only fits a pair of shoes. My brother needed a bag for work, it's sturdy but not a lot of space and for a nurse this is crucial"
4,Affordable Durable Medical Bag,Great medical bag for the price.Made from durable Nylon and has plenty of compartments inside for easy storage.Wish it could be little bigger to store also files.
2,Nice but Questionable Quality,"I use this bag to carry all the meds I take on a daily basis along with a BP monitor and glucose meter. Plenty of room for everything I need to put in it, plus enough pockets to help keep things organized. I've had the bag for about two months now, and although it has never been over-filled or handled roughly, the stitching/seams are starting to come apart on the inside. This is simply poor quality. Would not recommend purchasing it."
4,"Good product, reliable delivery, a bit slow to get here","This is a great bag for medical students to tote their equipment around the clinic. It has lots of compartments, is durable, and has space to store papers/files as well without being too huge."
4,great low-cost choice,"This bag is exactly as I expected. Not super padded, but it holds a lot without being too big. It's perfect for a medical student that isn't likely to carry too much equipment too often."
2,I was fooled.,"The picture for this bag makes it look like it has some structure and size to it. It doesn't. For right around $30, I was expecting a lot more than what I got. It looks and feels cheaply made and simply doesn't offer much room. Take the search for a nice medical/nursing bag elsewhere."
3,Check this out!,"This DVD is really great, not only you can see the best moments from Britney, Justin & Christina, but you can also enjoy some of the old episodes of the Mickey Mouse Club!"
5,Never.,"As in, I never thought I had to wait this long! But nonetheless, I am pleased that this DVD is coming out! Whoo hoo..these are the 3 biggest popstars in the world right now, and they arn't moving slowely. LOL. I am so happy that this is being released....I'm going to enjoy this ESPECIALLY, because of Christina and her pipes!"
2,I Want my MMC!,"Where is the whole series? From Season 1 to Season 7. I feel gypped. I want my MMC!!! Give me the whole thing from Brandy Brown & Jason Minor, to Tony Lucca, JC Chasez, Ilana Miller, Keri Russell, to Britney and Justin!"
3,Dissapointed,"As an MMC fan, I was so pleased to find this - but feel no effort was put into making this dvd. It was not edited out in anyway, so 4x you watched the theme song, 4x the closing credits etc. It was basically approx 4 full length episodes, which featured segments on Brittney, Justin & Christina in their home towns. Other than that, it was DEFINITELY NOT A BEST OF- as the rest of the dvd hardly showed them. It ran random segments not even featuring mousekeeters, when there was plenty of footage to chose from (which could have highlighted what it was sold as)P.S. Don't know why it says Tiffini Hale (under the name of the dvd) as she wasn't in this at all.Would not have purchased if I realised what this really was."
4,Nice try...but not enough,"This show ran for about six to seven seasons. In those seasons, plenty of people came and went, all of whom were amazingly talented. Britney, Justin and Christina were only on there for the last two seasons. I beleive that some poeple who have never seen the show before are going to be surprised to watch it and find that besides Christina, who had an amazing voice, Justin and Britney were pretty average. WHat I hope happens is that the tiny glimpse of the rest of the cast members will stir enough curiousity that the seasons will be released indivdually. And, lastly, while Britney and the other two are super famous, it's a pain to see Keri Russell, Ryan Gosling and JC Chasezs completely left out. As a matter of fact, those of us who watched the show back then, remember a time when the screaming girls were screaming for JC and Keri, two of the most popular cast members on the show."
3,What about an entire season?,"It seems like a huge marketing stunt to make a DVD totally devoted to these three mouseketeers and not create complete season DVD's from this run of the Mickey Mouse Club. Britney, Justin, and Christina were only mouseketeers in '93 and '94 and there is still a tremendous fan base of people who watched the show from '89-'94 and who would like to see more than just these three spotlighted. I wish that Disney was releasing an ""entire first season,"" all the way up through an ""entire 6th season"" in '94 for the people who just want to see the most famous 'teer alumni. I am sure that this DVD will make them more money, but it seems to discount the other fabulous talent that made the show what it was. I hope that eventually entire season DVD's are released from the MMC. It was a fabulous part of a lot of our childhoods. They just don't make shows like this anymore! :)"
1,Disapointing,"I loved the New Mickey Mouse Club from season 1, even as new episodes were showing while I was still in high school. I was very excited to see that Disney was releasing this, even if it were only a few episodes based around three of the many talented kids on the show. The fond memories I have that revolve around this show...However, the four episodes on this DVD did not highlight the talent of Christina, Britney and Justin or the rest of the cast for that matter. All the musical numbers (except one) were prerecorded from the MMC concert. The skits were not some of the best, but Keri Russel fans will probably get a kick out of seeing her in many of the episodes. I hope people who buy this DVD don't judge the entire show on these four episodes."
2,Not true to MMC Fans,"Being a true MMC fan from season 1 to the end I'm very disappointed! I would rather have all the episodes instead of skits highlighting just THREE MMC'ers (who were only in the last two seasons mind you). I think if they would want to produce a product, produce one that is worth it! Or, if you want to feature the stars of the 90's MMC why not also include Golden Award winner Keri Russell, fellow NSYNCer JC Chasez, actor Dale Godboldo, and ""The Party"" members?? To me it's a tease, and not what the MMC fans truley want. That's just my opinion though, and you can take it for what its worth."
3,Not What I expected,"This DVD is good to buy if you were a fan of the show like I was. If you are buying it to see the best of the mentioned artists at work you will be disappointed. There are four shows that only show a little of Brit, Justin and Christina at work. What you do see is a 2-3 min feature of the three in three diff episodes. Like what they do daily at their homes and for fun at that time. I'm angry also over the fact that JC Chasez isn't featured. Still it is nice to watch the show that I used to love. I only wish that they would come out with the complete show like the old one did."
2,Disappointment to Real MMC Fans,"Four epsidoes from JUST season 6? I agree with most of these reviews in that Disney is just trying to jump on the Britney, Justin and Christina bandwagon. This is such a disappointment to those who watched, worked on, and truly loved the show. The real highlights of MMC were the other talented cast members, who were not featured. Dedicated fans know that Britney, Justin and Christina were never the most popular 'teers--why create a DVD just around them?On the plus side, this DVD features two of the better Season 6 skits--Generation Gap Shoppping and Everybody's a Winner (none of which include Brit, Justin or Christina). And, it has some good shots of 'teer siblings and friends like Trace, Jamie Lynn, Laura Lynn and Rachael (if this is interesting to anyone).This DVD will flop, and it deserves to. Disney needs to get their act together and create something that would embrace what the show really was--or not do anything at all."
5,The amazing Jarrett Mynear,This book wonderfully documents the incredibly tough life of this amazing boy and shows why he changed so many lives (mine included) with his grace and strength during his short life. Having the opportunity to meet Jarrett Mynear before his death changed my life forever. Reading this book will surely have the same effect on you. Marvin Bartlett does a wonderful job capturing the true spirit of this extremely strong boy and his family. A MUST read.
3,OK...not the best!,I bought this shaver to help with lint and fuzz balls that seem to appear after a while when doing laundry (even when everything is washed in like colors). It worked OK (not the best) but you have to be extremely careful as it can knick your clothes. Do your research as there has to be a better product out there.Thanks!
2,Lint remover,"This product does not work effectively. It would not even de-lint a sweater. However, the package did arrive in a timely manner."
1,Surround Air XJ-350 Electric Fabric Shaver,"This product does not seem to work, waste of money. I have been working on one dress for over 45 minutes with no results. My dog chewed part of the box, I cant even return it, Yikes! I wouldnt recommend this to anyone, pay a little more and get something that actually works."
1,good product but too long to get,"Product is good, the only thing I did not like was it took me 1 month to get it since the date I put the order until the day I got it in the mail. I don't recommend it if you are nneding this product in a short time. The person that needed the product travelled 1 week before we got the product."
1,Pretty useless,"I purchased this 'heavy duty' shaver to help get rid of some of the pilling on my couch. The thing just STOPS. I thought perhaps the pills on the couch might be too much for any shaver, so I tried it one a sweater. A little better - started to get rid of the pills - then it STOPPED AGAIN. I don't know if this thing is defective, but I doubt it - it's most likely just poorly made to begin with. Sigh. My search for a decent shaver continues."
3,Could do better.,"As far as fabric shavers, the small cheap ones work just as well, however the power runs out fast and you use a lot of batteries. As for this one, it continues to run on DC, but it is no better than the cheap ones. So I would say, if you have very little fabric problems don't waste the money, however if you have a lot of items or large items, it is worth your while."
4,Excellent product.,"I've had this shaver for a few years and it still works great on my pants and sweaters. I have not had any issues with it ripping anything. What is most surprising is that I have only changed the batteries once since I've purchased it, which is a good thing because I have not idea where the charger could be."
2,Not the best,"I had a bunch of sweaters which I don't have time to hang up to dry so they get tossed in the dryer. They were all looking pretty fuzzy and balled up, so time to shave them. I like the AC part over battery but it takes forever and ever and ever to just get a little bit to come off of the sweater. I know the blades can't be super sharp on these or they will go through the fabric, but come on, a little bit would be nice. I felt more like I was giving my sweaters a nice vibrating massage instead of trying to get the fuzz off. Not the greatest for sure."
1,Difficult to use,"I purchased this product for my 80 year old mother and she was unable to remove the trap cover. Even for my 45 year old hands, it was very stiff and challenging to remove. We've returned this product. It may work great, but we couldn't even try it out."
2,Worked a little now not at all!,I bought this shaver to help with sweater fuzz balls. It worked okay (not perfect) but you have to be careful with it and make sure the material doesn't get bunch up or else you will get knicks in your clothes. It happened to 2 of my tops. I just got it out after it had been stored for a few months and apparently the motor has gone out. I tried to use the battery option as well as the electric plug and nothing happens when I turn the shaver on. Its been over a year since I purchased it so the warranty is no longer in effect. I guess I got some of my moneys worth out of it but definitely not what I paid for it! I do not recommend this product. Do some research and find a better one.
3,Not quite sure,"Not quite sure how to rate this. When I start useing this on a sweater, it works great, cuts off all the pills. After about five minutes of use, the motor seems to change somehow, and it stops cutting. Still runs, just seems to stop cutting. So, it's okay, not great."
3,Question,I'm interested in buying this item but can a previous buyer please inform me first if this item it's A/C wall adapter is 110volt or 220volt operated?
3,"It's ok, but I have had better shavers in the past.","I bought this fabric shaver because my old one, after having a good run for many years was dying. This fabric shaver does the job like 80%, it still left a few lint balls no matter how many times you go over it, which is annoying. I mean it does the job but ot 100%. It is better than nothing, but still a tad disappointment."
1,Terrible,"In a word, it doesn't work. It's big which is nice, but it doesn't work. Very disappointing, don't waste your money on this product"
1,Didn't work at all,This really didn't work well at all so I returned and purchased the D-Fuzz-It Sweater and Fabric Comb for under $5 and IT worked great!
3,"I'm just going to re-post my review for a different scent, because the review is not about the specific scent.","So, I guess I'm used to the big candles, but this candle puts out almost no smell. Perhaps it should be used only in small rooms such as half-bathrooms, but it seemed to produce almost no scent. The smell of the candle is, of course, extremely yummy, but that doesn't help when the smell doesn't come out of the candle."
1,"Not a ""Cables To Go"" Cable","Cables to Go confirmed via phone that all their cables are labeled either on the poly bag or on the cable. This is a generic made-in-China cable. A reviewer of another cable from CiTi had the same comment -- that they substituted a generic cable for a name-brand one. Contacted CiTi and they wanted me to send a picture of the cable. The poly bag is long gone, and the cable was for an out-of-state friend. If you want a Cables To Go brand cable, buy elsewhere. If you want a generic cable where the shipping charge is half the cost of the cable, buy this one."
4,"Oh, the Memories Come Back","It's like being a child again in the 50's watching the Mickey Mouse Club. Five hour long episodes, one for each day of the week, the unfortunate thing is that its not a continuous week. The episodes skip about over the life of the series and highlight different aspects of the show such as the Adventures of Spin & Marty, Annette, and the Hardy Boys. A great buy for the money."
5,M I C K E Y M O U S E song,"We were looking for the exact words of the Mickey Mouse song we all sang when we were young and were delighted to not only remember all the words when we heard it on the DVD, but to see the old Mickey Mouse Club programs. Thanks.."
1,Micky mouse club,Please lose the cartoons. Waste of money. We are in our sixtys now. We want to go back in time and don't want cartoons. What a rip off. Walt Disney would not be happy.....I hope!
1,The Worst of the Mickey Mouse Club,"I loved the Mickey Mouse Club, having watched it in syndication when I was young. It is sentimental to watch this video, but it is far from the best. It is just a compilation of a few from I believe to be one season. There is no restoration of the video. I was hoping for so much more. I think I'll try my luck with Disney Treasures."
4,As good today as it was yesteryear,"When I was a kid I would rush home to watch the Mickey Mouse Club, today I baby-sit my grandchildren and they are just as excited about the Mickey Mouse Club as I was when it first came on the air. My grandchildren are 6 years and 2 1/2 years old and they love Mickey Mouse Club as do I. They go around singing the ""Original"" theme music all the time."
2,really boring,This was a really boring version of what I grew up with. I wouldn't recommend it. I wanted to see more of Annette.
2,You can't go home again,"Some children's shows age well and retain their charm (""Stingray"" and ""Thunderbirds"" with their careful attention to detail, ""Gumby"" with its surrealism, ""Davey and Goliath"" with its classic moral lessons). I was looking forward to the Mickey Mouse Club on DVD as I had fond memories of watching it every afternoon after school. This has not aged well. ""Spin and Marty"" and ""The Hardy Boys"" serials are still enjoyable (they were both serialized on this program). The rest of this resembles an endless talent show put on at your local public school by some local kids. It isn't very entertaining. It gets tedious quickly. It moves very slowly. The production numbers were expensive by children's show standards in the fifties but they look cheap and tacky by today's standards. Dull. I used my fast forward button a great deal on this one."
4,Awesome magical realism,"I was assigned Tropic of Orange in a class and found myself totally engrossed in the scewed story lines. if you like books that make you stop and think, what the ... is going on here?! Then you will LOVE this book. Great criticism on the US, media and Los Angeles too!"
2,Terrible book,"I had to read this book for my junior level literature course and I have to say that I was extremely disappointed. The book offered some insight but it seemed to confuse people more than convey a message. Everyone I talked to in my class about this book (including the professor) was confused about the ending of the novel. Not only did I not enjoy reading this book, but I was left with little closure at the end of the novel. I would not recommend this book to anyone and I would absolutely not consider re-reading this book."
3,Smaller than advertised,"I bought these and although the description says 2 3/8 x 3 3/8 inches, the usable holder area is only about 2.5 x 3.25 inches, which means a standard ID card would be sticking out of the top of this holder by about 1/8th of an inch. The badge stays in the holder under normal wear, but I would have liked the badge to be ENTIRELY in the holder and not sticking out as it is.Also these are the recessed lip type holder - meaning one side is shorter than the other and the opening is 3/4th of an inch down from the top (similar to the design of the Card Saver, for those of you who collect sports cards), as opposed to the clam shell type - even length on both sides with the opening at the top (the design of a top loader protector, again for those of you that know what they are).The plastic quality on these is moderate. Not paper thin, but does not feel sturdy either."
5,they work!,"I use these to hold my work and transit rfid badges. Both in the same holder on a badge reel, and both scan through the holder right away (I don't have to take them out or face one the right way or anything). That's all I was looking for, so these are a winner in my book. On top of that, very sturdy construction, they aren't super thin and flimsy or anything. Don't know how much more you can ask for in a badge holder, so that's why I'm giving 5 stars :)"
4,"Pretty good, cards can slip out","This is a decent and sturdy item. I do wish the clip would keep the card from slipping out. A piece of tape holds the card in place, so it is not the end of the world."
3,"Good for protecting a badge, but flimsy","I work at an airport and these are perfect for providing protection from our badges to prevent wear, however they are very flimsy and the vinyl can tear easily, so be sure you don't lose your badge as a result! They do a good job of protecting the badge from. Wear, and the vinyl is easy to see through, so hopefully that will make up for the flimsy clip hole at the top."
1,not recieved,I appreciate you asking me for a review. Sadly I cannot offer you one as I never recieved the product. I was billed quite efficiently though.
1,A useless mask,"When I read the title, I thought finally something refreshing as are only Eastern philosophies. It was not. The interjection of biblical elements detracted from the approach I was expecting, thereby making it a sham on so many levels. It is Christian trying to dress up as Zen, and it doesn't work."
4,Great Book,"Trying to sum up this book, the author's own words come to mind: a ""street smarts"" of sorts for Eastern philosophy. It is a unique and refreshing look at the same not-so-obvious-to-some drudgery.It covers basic tenets that will change your life if you live by them. Sluyter avoided meditation details which indeed enhances the applicability of this book to most people's lives. I found the practical advice, in Dean's own original language, very valuable.The general pace of the book is good as well, keeping the reader interested at some level. If you are set in your ways or have a negative outlook, you probably won't find much here. If you have already based opinions on Eastern religions, I'd still bet this book expands your Zen conversation skills."
5,Sluyter Touts the Good Stuff,"In pronouncing his name, it says ""rhymes with lighter,"" but it should say, ""rhymes wit fighter,"" cause Sluyter comes out punching. His no nonsense approach is just the kick in the pants many of us need to fall into realization of our spirituality. Sluyter is intellectual, but counteracts it with a certain abecedarian common sense that makes this book fun and easy to read. If you're at all skeptical about what he's saying, the quotes remove much of the doubt. What I love about this book is the universal approach to spirituality a la Sri Ramakrishna. It took all of my effort just to prevent myself from nidificating while reading this page turner. His ability to reach an audience should make even the holiest teacher green wih envy. I'm waiting patiently for the next Sluyter book, because this one changed my life faster than a las vegas wedding."
4,This looks interesting,"I wish I could give this one and the sequel a full set of stars, but I haven't had much of a chance to watch it as of yet. I would say go ahead and get this one and it's sequel especially if one already has the animated series. That way the set would be more complete. That's what I try to do when possible. Like the movie that follows this one, can't wait to watch it as time will permit. Blu-ray rocks."
3,"Interesting Concept, Annoying Overall","I've never heard of the comics or knew it to be derived from a written series before watching this movie. The concept of the story is very interesting and original. The annoying parts are when the main characters run around with guns but don't shoot their targets. They wait until they're knocked down and their guns are out of the hands then they're reaching after it. Or they'd run around with guns but never shoot at a giant target. Both the dubbing and the subtitle were horrible. It was hard to follow the story. Maybe if I was a fan of the comics, I would have enjoyed this more."
4,cheaper at walmart,this is a good table. the kids enjoy eating outside on it. but it is much much much cheaper at walmart and it comes with the umbrella. it is a lot more than 50% cheaper at walmart.com
3,no fun to put together,"i don't mind putting together kids' stuff but this table was ridiculous. tons of long screws that need to be tightened in confined locations. now that it is together it is pretty cool, althought the easy fold feature requires four screws to be removed. if an adult tried to sit on this it would break for sure. the main thing i like about it is the natural colors as opposed to most of the other brands bright ""fun"" colors. the kids like to walk on the table which is fine with me since it's out in the grass where a slam wouldn't be as bad as if it was on a hard surface."
4,"Great table, but tough to put together","I bought this table prior to my son's birthday, so the kids would have a place of their own to sit at. Two of my male cousins attempted to put it together before the party & could not get the one section to fit. My Mom & I ended up tackling it a few days later. It required me drilling holes into the bench pieces to make them line up on the one section. Once we got that fixed, putting the rest of the table together was easy. I think the table is worth the cost as my son loves using it. I did give it less stars because of the problems with assembly."
4,"Setup is iffy, table is great","I got 2 of these. The first one went together with no problems! However, when I went to put together the second one, not only was one of the bolts the wrong kind (I had 15 of the normal bolts and one that was longer and had a V-shaped head), but the holes on 2 of the sections didn't quite match.After an hour of trial and error bolting different holes first, I finally got it together and it works great. That one long bolt, however, sticks out quite a bit more than the recommended .25""! But... is is kind of stuck in there because of the way I had to squeeze things together to get them to fit, so it's not worth my time to get a new bolt."
3,Hard to put together but fun once you have done it.,"We received this as a gift for my son's second birthday. We were excited to have some furniture for him that was at his own level instead of using a booster seat for our patio furniture.Unfortunately, my husband had to pull out his tool box, actually READ the directions, and get the assistance of two family members before we got this thing assembled.However, once it was done my son was delighted and we have gotten great use out of it.I am confused as to why it is referred to as fold and store as my husband just struggled to put it away for the winter."
1,Not meant for more than one child on each side,"I was very excited to finally find a table that would hold my 3 girls (twins age 6 and another age 3) and my 3 nephews (age 7, 5, and 3). The box says that this table will fit up to 8 children and is recommended for children 2 - 8 years of age. Therefore I was very disappointed when two of the kids (and not the biggest ones) sat on the same side and the bench started bowing. This happened during the first time we used the table. We checked all bolts and they were tight. The table does not support very much weight on each side. Note: The heaviest of these six children only weighs 50 lbs. We will be returning this product."
2,Disappointed ...,"Tonight I purchased the Fold 'n' Store picnic table. I was always impressed with the quality of Little Tikes products, so I didn't think this product would be any different (especially when bearing a $69.99 price tag). I was wrong. I have 4 complaints:1. I lost 1.5 hours of my life (granted, the kids were helping) assembling the product only to find that minimal pressure will bend the seat. I couldn't imagine letting two 40-pound children sit on either seat.2. The bolts stick out the bottom of the brace support and could easily cut a child's head when they crawl under the table (you know kids).3. Folding the table flat is a chore as four wing nuts need to be removed, the safety bracket on each leg needs to be removed, and then the brackets need to be reassembled.4. Maneuvering the `flat' table is cumbersome because the seats are not secure when the table is not being used. I found this out while putting it in the van for the ride back to Toys ""R"" Us."
3,Just say yes if you get it used.,"There's not much to say about this disc really. The tracklist pretty much speaks for itself. Bands on Sire records, obviously from the late 80's/early 90's. Most are pretty good, but my favorites are from Depeche Mode, Echo And The Bunnymen, James, Ice-T, Throwing Muses, and The Replacements of course. It's a good collection to find used."
3,"Fun, but a little too basic for me","Would be great for beginners, the instructors are great, the music could be better, but a good program to get you moving"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON,I will never order from amazon again. This is the second time I never received order and you cannot talk to them. It took me 3 months to get money back with my bank. They first charged me for an item that they did not even carry any longer. Now I will have to go through same headache.
2,Obsolete item that performs part of the task,"Although it sounded like the perfect way to connect my Sirius radio to the Bose stereo in my 1996 Mercedes S320, when it arrived I found that, like an earlier comment described, it had a connector that plugged into the cable in the trunk, not the connector on the back of the radio. After connecting it, the AUX 1 input worked as CD1, Track 11. However, I could find no combination that would select AUX 2. I called the Tech Support number from the installation instructions and was told that: a)This unit has been out of production for more than 3 years; b)There is probably no way to select AUX 2 from my Bose receiver; c)It may be a defective unit, but it is no longer supported, so it can't be repaired if it is bad; d)The best way to get AUX 2 working is to return it, and buy one from a different company. Disappointing, Amazon!"
4,The King Abdicates at the height of his power,"This is William Kings last contribution to the long running 'Gotrek & Felix' series. 'Giantslayer' which is the seventh book in the series, focuses on the High Elf Mage 'Teclis'. Teclis is in and out of a number of Warhammer stories as a plot element, but here you really get a good exploration of his character. 'Giantslayer' also explores the rather different land of 'Albion', and the interaction between Dwarf and Elf within the Warhammer world. Oh, and the usual amount of extreme mayhem.An enjoyable entry in this long running series. Later installments of Gotrek and Felix are written by 'Nathan Long', who wrote the highly entertaining 'Blackhearts' Warhammer trilogy for 'Black Library'."
2,not satisfied,when i purchased the book i was told it was in stock and would be in within a week. 2 weeks later i got the email that it was NOT in stock and i would not receive it until a month later which didnt help because it was suppsoed to be here for valentines day. and is still got it later than they said i would after a month went by
3,I think King is running out of foes...,"Giants?What do giants have to do with huge demon hordes?Teclis?What buisness do the elves have with anything. I think elves should just die somewhere or something.Yes, there are perfectally good reasons for everything. But it just seems a bit forced with GIANTS?How can Gotrek, killer of countless deamons and chaos warriors lose to some lamo giant? He's killed a bloodthirster of the same goddamned size, for jeebus's sake.And pairing up the most powerful warrior EVER with the most powerful magictian EVER and it's a bit hard to lose.Dont get me wrong, this was a great book. At least up to King's usuall standard of writing and intricate detail. It just seemed strange about them being warped half the way across the world to far-off albrion to kill a giant?I'm wondering what's next. Beastslayer 2? Chaosslayer? Lizardslayer? Elfslayer (I damned well am praying for the last one!)Grand book, but the setting seems a bit forced."
5,Very Excellent Service!,"I had very quick responses when I had questions regarding the textbook, and it also arrived in a timely manner."
4,"Deep text, but good intro book","This book is definitely for serious aero engineering students. Very in-depth, very detailed. Don't expect light material for those who are with no background in some physics, statics and dynamics. Wish it had more examples for working on to better understand concepts, and more illustrations. Interesting book nonetheless."
5,"Great writer, text covers every detail. What more can I say?","John D Anderson is a great writer, three of my Aerospace Engineering classes have used his text books and I've very done well in all of them. I could learn the material without lecture using these books. Best text books I've ever read."
5,"Excellent product!! Exactly as advertised, prompt shipping even overseas!!","This book is exactly what I needed. No metrication, there are the original problems, with a mix of SAE and Metric questions. Definitely made my Masters class easier!!"
3,do not know the title of this song Help,"The song begins (female artist)-----"" At last my love has come along.....If anyone knows the title,artist,yr I would be so grateful. Thanks,jb"
4,sodom,I had a problem getting this dvd to play in it's entirety...but the part that I was able to watch of this documentary on finding Sodom and Gomorrah was quite interesting...I will try again on another dvd player...hope I did not receive a faulty dvd
2,Not exactly scorching,"Hazel is supposed to love sex but the voice in the novel is very dull and ho hum, quite jevenile in fact, and she has a active fantasy life but there is little actual heat in what she does. Bum fixations are getting kind of passe. Skip this one unless you are really hard up and don't mind grammar errors and dumb heroines."
2,Not ideal,"1 RPM is a good pace, but i'm giving this unit 3 stars because:1. when rotating, the product constantly stop and go, there's no continuous motion. you'd probably need buy some chain/rope to tie to your disco ball to sort of smooth out the otherwise jerky movements2. it has a very short (2 feet?) cable and needs a type B (3 metal pin) electric outlet, i think most household electric outlet extensions don't have type B outlets.****11/9/2012updating this to two stars. after a year and a few months, it feels that the clicks from the motor noise are significantly louder."
2,ARRIVAL TIME,"Process of ordering was okay, once placed, there was some conversation about delivery, I paid extra to have the item shipped quickly, it arrived after the date that I needed."
1,Horrible motor,"I bought this for my daughter to hold a small 8"" mirror ball. Within the first week, the motor would stutter. I returned it and got a 2nd one. Right out of the box, the motor stuttered. It's just a horrible product from my experience. I'll be trying the 3 RPM next to see if a faster motor will run smoother."
3,jerky movement,"Solid-built motor at the right speed (I wouldn't go more than 2 rpm for a mirror ball -- makes people sick otherwise), BUT I have noticed that it makes the ball pause ever so slightly sometimes as it makes it's way around. Not really noticeable for my application, but it should be smoother."
3,Banana Boat instant bronzer,I found this product to be a little drying on the skin after several uses. Color was not perfect but need alot of exfoliating. The price was very good.
3,A career chronology,The book reads more like a history of SS-Leibstandarte Adolph Hitler than one of Sepp Dietrich - and for that I was disappointed. The march history is available in many other books.
2,Low quality cable,"This cable did not work when the cable was run in a bundle containing 4 CAT5 cables to my gigabit switch. When run in the bundle with the CAT5 cables this cable would only connect to the switch at 100mbps. If I took the cable out of the bundle and ran it across the foor where there were no other cables nearby, then the cable would connect at 1000mbps.This cable, even though the manufacturer says it is CAT6, really only works for 100mbps Ethernet CAT5."
2,Not worth it!,"there were about two things said on this tape that was of importance. Everything she said, was repeated again at least twice sometimes three times using the same wording even! Without repetition the tape probably be about 10 minutes."
1,Not quite what I expected,"I am very surprised at the high ratings this book has been given, the new ""Look Inside"" feature is wonderful,if I had the chance to look inside the book before ordering it,I definitely would not have bought it. Most designs are thematic:christmas, halloween,mother goose and puppies. I only liked some of the garden designs. To be fair I should say that the layout of this book is very good along with its well defined charts, other than that it's over-rated."
2,You really have to love Mary Englebreit,"I have had this book for 12 years and I have yet to stitch a single design. I looked through it the other day and nothing grabbed me and said, ""You must stitch this."" I love whimsical things, and I enjoy Mary Englebreit's artwork, but, for some reason this just doesn't speak to me like it must have when I was looking at it in the store. The designs feel somewhat dated to me, and I am not sure that, given the chance to purchase it again, that I would spend the money for it."
5,"Easy up, easy down",This canopy is great. It took me 10 minutes max to put it up (with no help) and 10 min to take it down. Worked great in our backyard for a kids birthday party to add shaded area on a sunny summer day. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Nice,We used this canopy at our 4th of July picnic. It was easy to assemble and provided our picnic with hours of shade. The only draw back is that it has many pieces of tubing to assemble prior to installing the canopy.
5,better than expected,"We bought the similar tan and silver version which is UV protective - otherwise same shock corded poles design...we used for 6 days of river running on the Rogue River and this unit performed flawlessly. Easy to set up and take down, works well, was as good as rain shelter as it is for the sun. In one camp we had high winds, and had to weight down the poles to keep it planted...but is survived without any damage. We'd buy another one if we could find the same one."
2,"Nice Look, Breaks Easily",This tent looks nice and it definitely sets you apart from the rest of the shelters its pretty diffuclt to put up with two people and the legs are made of thin metal and snaps pretty easily. This is a good value but I strongly reccommend against anyone buying it. I would go with the new design Swiss Gear models that cost just a little bit more and is probably 10 times more sturdy and very easy to put together.
3,Interesting but of a particular point of view,"The book has interesting moments and would be enjoyable for anyone that follows the investment management industry. Things I liked: sketches of various unnamed managers (can you tell who they are?), his feelings on raising money for his fund, his takes on the returns of asset classes and funds. Things I didn't like: the few factual inaccuracies (Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is not out of print, a squabbling point might be when the first hedge fund appeared), his statements on his personal investment style. He says he's a value investor, but the whole passage on shorting oil in 2004 is nothing but a recount of speculation. If you don't mind reading a book where the author says don't fight the market while at the same time saying he likes fundamental research, read on. I do not think that this book will be remembered beyond a summer or two."
1,Random,"This book is very random. Poorly laid out and poorly written with a lot of paragraphs ending in cliches. ""As they say, buy low sell high"" and crap like that. Also, filled with reviews of books that BB read (who cares?) and random stories like the second to last chapter where some sales guy gets the WSJ a day early magically and becomes a star salesman - BB portrayed this as if it actually happened?! This book made my blood run cold. And what is a hedgehog anyway? Stupid."
4,Entertaining & Educational,"I didn't know the hedge fund world was such a dog eat dog world. I thought that these managers had a cushy job for life, but now I realize that you're only as good as your recent performance. And that big money transfers funds so easily with no regard.An honest book that includes the famous oil trade."
1,Horrible,"This book is a complete joke, that only two people ""praised"" it on the book jacket says it all. It flows horribly and hope that this as my first amazon review (been buying here since '98) sends others to books worthy of their time. I trade derivatives as a profession and he'd be laughed off of our trading desk."
1,trite and boring,"As someone who is in the hedge fund business, i had a very difficult time making it through this book. It is filled w/ boring, trite anecdotes and teaches the reader very little about investing...I was very dissapointed...I have read most of the great books on investing and investors and this isn't even close...I could not in good conscience recommend this book-- a complete waste of time"
1,lost in transition,"the book is compeltely unstructured. the author jumps from one theme to another. finally we get this crazy story about the guy who sees tommorow's numbers in today's WSJ and get a brief on Keins biography. come on guys! if you dont know what to write in a book, publish your articles in journals. he's a smart guy(the author), but a lousy writer. Maybe he's got a lousy publisher, somone shoul've helped him structure it much better."
2,Poor book overall with the occasional insightful flash,"This book is basically a collection of notes assembled by a successful hedge fund manager. I would like to break the review down into structure and content. Structurally the book is an absolute mess. The book lurches from chapter to chapter in no logical order. Some of the writing is fairly pedestrian. The shifts from prose to diary to prose again can be disconcerting for the reader. The content ranges from the insightful to the ridiculous. Although the author does have flashes of brilliance, he also touts ridiculous concepts such as the contrarian indicator, hot streaks and reversion to the mean. As an example of the ridiculous the author dedicates an entire chapter to a man who allegedly could obtain a ""special"" edition of the Wall Street Journal which contained future prices. As an example of the random, the author dedicates a chapter to the life of Keynes. I find it difficult to recommend this book to anybody."
1,Pretty Worthless,"This book offers little new insight into the world of high-level money management. One chapter is devoted to how a fund manager got stuck short oil and it blew up in his face. While I did enjoy thinking about him fading the market the whole way up, there is already ample literature stating that good traders must exit losers, even when they think the market is ""mispriced.""This book really went nowhere, and was nothing more than a cluster f*** of poorly told war stories.Drobny's ""Inside the House of Money"" is a much finer alternative for those interested in learning how large funds attempt to manage risk."
4,A Worthy Contribution,"Biggs' book is noteworthy in that it makes a good contribution to the small but growing literature on hedge funds. In this piece, Biggs offers some interesting profiles of several fund managers, reflections on bubbles and manias, a biographical chapter of Keynes, and other items that would be of interest to anybody involved in the markets. I especially liked his take on the next investment craze of this decade, namely: emerging markets. And he provides a good look at which ones will likely surge in the years ahead (Africa and the Middle East).So, overall, its a good book. Some chapters I skipped largely because I was familiar with the information and arguments."
5,A Master,Biggs has great stories to tell that keep your attention. He makes me want to be a better investor. I highly recommend.
4,Great Read,"I found this book to be fairly light and entertaining. While it may not make you an expert on hedge funds, it will nevertheless give you a good idea of how this lesser known form of investing works. The stories that Mr. Biggs tells are like a series of short stories and I enjoyed each of them. Well written."
1,this passes for reading (and wisdom) in the investment community,"Flabbily written and uninformative in an insider, I was there, manner-he may be a genius of finance and his insights may be oracular but they appear pedestrian in book form. It is the theatre that is mesmeric. If talk about billions impresses you and you think you are getting useful straight talk, this is the book for you. Just more cashing in; a waste really."
3,"Ok book, lousy Kindle conversion","Biggs is an engaging enough teller of anecdotes, but he's prone to making conclusions based on little to no data. He also seems blinded by his own industry's whoppers. Claiming, for instance, that LTCM went down because of ""3 sigma"" events is just plain wrong. The Kindle conversion is sloppy. Font sizes are off. Dashes that originally seem to hae split word in a paper text are for some reason retained. Lazy."
4,A fun way to learn about the travails of professional investing,"Biggs is an insider and has been one for a LONG time, and so this book tells a lot about the ""color"" of the professional investing world, without divulging much of any technical interest. I was enlightened when I read it because I came out of the quantitative investing community, which cares mostly about Sharpe ratio and controlling volatility, while, as you learn from ""Hedgehogging"", the garden variety hedge fund operators just go around playing their hunches, and don't care if their drawdown is 80%. Not to say that this is better than obsessing over volatility, but does help one relax a bit, so this book really helped me professionally (despite complete lack of specific info)."
4,Good Book,"This is an interesting book on the Hedge Fund world. It is more or less the opinions of one man, but I found it to be a quick interesting read."
3,Interesting Tid Bits and Gossip,"The first half was informative but morphed into a social standing autobiography of Barton Biggs havng gone to Yale, living in Greenwich, being grubstaked for $150K 40 years ago and his rubbing elbows with the rich and famous.The Book did show how difficult it is to raise money for any fund, particularly since there is so much money sloshing around. I give Barton credit for not only admitting how tough he found raising money, considering his experience and contacts, but also admitting to his lackluster performance.He also confirmed that all is not what it seems in terms of media and public perceptions vs. reality, that most hedge funds have not performed well. The exceptions are the 3-4 mega funds with well deserved legacies and operating histories.An interesting read."
2,Not Great,"The synopsis of this book was intriguing, but ultimately the book itself was rather disappointing. Compared to other Harlequin books, it didn't measure up."
2,"A good, but basic introduction to Intranets.","While this book was a good explanation of intranets and what they do, it didn't go into much detail on how to actually implement one. The book is also out of date already! I would recommend this only to someone who wants to learn more about Intranets but doesn't need to put one together."
4,Great fit - Nikon D5100.,"Perfect fit for a Nikon D5100 on a Dobsonian 8"" telescope. No light leakage and sturdy enough to support the camera body. Works exactly as advertised and excellent value for the price."
1,just don't,"I got this stroller from a friend, brand new. I took it on a test drive to Disney land for 6 hours. After one day, a wheel is bent, and my arm is totally killing. I have larger kids--42lbs and 28lbs. There is no way this stroller could hold the maximum pounds. I was counting on this because my younger child has special needs and will be in it for a while. The manouverability is rediculous. The parent cup holder is not in a workable spot if you put your diaper bag on the handlebar. Folding it is very difficult unless you're a houdini. I think that's how my wheel got bent. What stroller damages itself when folding? This one! The storage is inaccessable, um need I go on? OK. I will. In the middle of the night I woke up with the most excrutiating pain in my arm.Thinking of this one for big kids--ie, not new born? Just DON'T!!!"
4,Rational Adult,"The tarot deck is so powerful. The personality of this deck is like a wise, old adult giving advice to me. The adult is a bit cold and cruel though, that's why I called it ""adult"". Very easy for reading. The card speaks to me in a very clear way. Why I notice when I go through all the cards description is that Walker always remind us not to forget the danger of positive cards. I personally do not like this, but I accept it as my mother always warning me not to do this and that. When I go for a mature advice, I will ask this deck."
3,Jumbled Numbers,"I bought this deck a few years ago and just recently decided to sit down and truly study the deck. I found a discrepancy in my pack. The major arcana corresponding with the number 8 is in the wrong place, it should be the number 11. The rest of the suit is correct. So Justice is where Strength should be. Has anyone else noticed this discrepancy and if so what have you done to correct it, also, is it a discrepancy at all? I noticed in other decks that 8 is associated with strength and that 11 is associated with justice and these decks are very old, so I think they are more accurate than this one. I am a little disappointed to find this out."
4,Practical history,"This book provides patterns and (very) basic instructions for constructing authentic fashions of the 1920's, made using original everyday garments. The patterns are on regular book pages printed on a grid. To use them one can either draw them out on bigger grid paper, or do what I did and take them to a copy center and blow them up on the oversize copier. This book is not for the novice sewer, but for someone with experience who wants a truly authentic 1920's look, you can't do better."
1,Junk,It rusted almost immediately and then the handle broke off from the brush which made it completely useless. Quality is very poor.
4,James Hadley Chase books,"I like James Hadley Chase books, This one is very good. I plan to read all his books. Especially his old books."
1,No! No! No!,"The connector for the PocketJet, PocketJet 200 and the PocketJet 2 have a totally different connector than does the battery for the PocketJet 3 and 3 Plus. While the battery size and capacity are the same, the connector is NOT."
3,Booze and love making,"Ralph is married to Alice Ann and plays on the side. Jim was first married to Judy and divorced because of his impotence. He is now married to Lindsay and plays around. Alice Ann plays around. Lindsay used to play around an awful lot before marriage. All these characters do, is drink. About once on every one of the 358 pages of this book. And, of course, they smoke pot every day. The main action plays seventeen years after all of them first got married. By now they should all be dead of various failures of internal organs.All this action is repetitive throughout the book. Furthermore, the characters change in mid stream. Lindsay, she of the one night stands, all of a sudden is the faithful wife. The book is billed as ""wildly comic"". That it certainly is not - unless you think it is fun to watch four people destroy themselves."
1,Rambling and Uninteresting,"There's no plot to this book, which would be fine if the book was populated with interesting characters. It isn't. The characters aren't likable or interesting. Getting through this book was a challenge and became purely a mechanical exercise.I'm irritated that I could have read several good books in the time it took me to wade through this one."
1,New Formula - Ingredients do not match Amazon description,Just a warning that Old El Paso has changed their taco seasoning and the ingredients do not match the product description on Amazon. The new seasoning made me ill and food products cannot be returned to Amazon but they did credit me for the purchase (great customer service on Amazon's part).
5,Great product; great price from Amazon!,"I eat lots of Mexican food and go through taco seasoning like some people go through salt and pepper! Buying in bulk from Amazon was great; I gave some of the canisters away as gifts; the rest I stored in my refrigerator until needed. If you refrigerate, the seasoning stays very fresh!"
3,Decent Muffler for the price,"Replaced a Spin tech muffler with this Stainless. (Spin Tech rotted out) It was a good price. Best used with a small car-OEM exhaust. I've a bit of a popping/backfire problem (I have headers). I may have to swap it out, but has a good tone at highway speeds. It just isn't big enough for larger engines."
3,It couldda been a contendah...,"This book could have been great. I've owned, played, gigged with, and fixed Hammonds for over 25 years, and I was very excited about a book like this being published. It does capture the excitement and wonder of these great instruments, but it's also obvious that the author never owned one (which he freely admits). There are many glaring errors in the labelling of Leslie and Hammond models in the photos, in technical details of differences between models, and in details about the company history. These may not reduce your enjoyment of the book, which has many historically valuable photos. Just take the information given with a grain of salt. There are many long time Hammond techs, dealers, and employees still living who have the real scoop. I'd love to see the errors in this book corrected in a new edition, while these people are still around to be consulted."
1,Save your dollars,"This book has been around awhile now, and the cognoscenti are in agreement...this is no book for those already familiar with the instrument. There's probably better information to be had on the Internet than could be gotten out of this paperback. Validity of the book's contents are inversely proportional to the reader's knowledge of the instrument. Good things are some quotes here and there from credible sources, such as Alan Young. Overall, however, it's just a picture book with some accompanying text and many errors spread through the entire content. Also present editorially is the omnipresent Hammond hyperbole, such as declaring the G-100 a ""technical success"", which, of course, it wasn't...it was an adject failure which booted Hammond out of the ""big organ"" market for good. You pay your ISP monthly anyway...get on your browser and use it, and save the cost of this much overhyped tome."
3,Unable to understand this.,I was trying to learn more about an old Hammond Organ and this did not help. probably because I did not understand it.
5,"Strong Message, Great Sound","Ginny Owens is an artist who certainly knows how to make beautiful music. She also has powerful Christian lyrics. She is obviously someone who has a deep faith and shows it in her songwriting.Her music here has an R&B; sound to it. It is centered around her piano playing. The sound is superb.The songs here are about God's faithfulness to us, His unconditional love for us, the pleasures that He provides for us, and the awesome prize at the end.I recommend this CD for the sound and the message both."
1,Primer,The is a small book with basic information on composition. Good for a 3rd or 4th grade introduction but otherwise really disappointing.
1,Melts Your Driveway Too,"Don't use this company's product ice melting products unless you plan to replace your concrete driveway. Even when used as directed, you'll be left with large holes in the concrete. it doesn't deserve even a one-star rating but couldn't write this review without at least one star."
3,titanic,Didn't get the book I ordered. At 1st just thought it was a different cover(edition).It did come fast & in excellent condition. Was still about the titanic and full of facts.
2,Childen might like it,"This book gives the most childish facts. I guess to a young child who only began his/her interest in Titanic might find this book as a good start, otherwise it is pointless buying this book, since it gives nothing new and gives inaccurate drawings. To a more interested person, I really would not recomend this book."
5,Great Batman animation,"This was a wonderful collection of Batman shows. Great stories, and great animation. I would highly recommend this DVD."
5,the best,"Batman the animated series is one of the best shows i have seen when it comes to hero animation, you have to buy this set and the other three"
3,"Great Show, Poorly Organized.","I love BTAS, and the quality is so great now that it's on DVD but the downside to this entire series is that when you buy it your not buying the episodes by the air date, your buying it by the production date. So nothing makes sense story wise unless you go to a episode guide and find an air date guide to go by. Even with this flaw I have enough patience to switch discs every other episode so it's no problem but it is a inconvenience."
5,If you miss the Animated Series.,"I miss the old school Batman. I had to start buying the old movies because I loved them so much. They are selling them at a great price on amazon. I just wait till they go on sale, or the price drops. If you want to see the old series, this is a great buy to do so. Those in my generation would understand."
5,Amazing,"Other reviews go into great detail of what these DVD set includes, I'll keep it my review short, but this is the greatest animated series ever made."
4,bang for your buck,"i have to say this was so good. my little brother and i watched the whole season the day we got it, i am a major justice league, batman, superman fan and if you love any of the 3 then you should watch this."
4,Great DVDS,The DVDs were neavers used or opend but closing the package after opening is a little tricky so be carful or you might break one if you force it
5,"Batman: The Animated Series, Volume One","As soon as the Warner Bros. icon transitions to the spotlights in the title opening; I am 12-years-old again. The orchestra music, the noir style animation, and the energy of it coming together leaves me awe struck. I loved this show growing up and love it still. I had introduced the style of this show to my son through the animated movies - ""Mask of the Phantasm"" and ""Subzero""; however, having these collections perpetuates the exciting mythology and adventures of a great chapter in the Batman pantheon. For any Batman fan these are wonderful, but if you are an aficionado of Loeb's ""Long Halloween"" and ""Dark Victory""; these collections are a must."
4,best batman series,"I believe this was the first of the DC animated series so the art and color is a bit rougher than later series but I still remember seeing the previews and thinking: I HAVE to see this!!! Never had I seen this kind of clean cut art and deco-ish designs in a cartoon.The exciting stories of Batman (voiced by same actor across the major animated DC series --- love the consistency) told with great art, stories, and voice actors. Special mention goes to the Joker and Harley Quinn --- who manage to steal the show every time --- and my especial favorite, a purr worthy Catwoman."
2,Love the shows but case was wrecked,When I bout got this set of DVDs I got them because I I was getting some other things at the same time price is the same as Walmart no deal at all there but when they came in there was a shipping tag that was covering up this big whole that went throw 3 layers of the case thank god the DVDs were ok but now I can't keep them on there case
2,"""The Batman/Superman Hour?"" What's up with that?","I originally downloaded this season on iTunes, so I would assume that the DVD set is exactly the same. This is by far the best treatment of Batman in animated form- but why did Warner Brothers have to include the lame ""Batman/Superman Hour"" intro on this set? Please tell me the other three seasons (or the DVD versions) didn't do this! If I'd have known that the digital downloads didn't include the original Batman Intro (which really set the tone for how cool this animated series was), I wouldn't have purchased it. Since there's no Superman episodes on this set (which is a good thing, since Bruce Timm's artistic style was better suited to Batman anyway), having the second rate Batman/Superman intro makes no sense."
2,YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE A GOOD DETECTIVE TO ENJOY THIS MESS,"Don't get me wrong ... I love Batman Animated and was really excited when I heard that Warner/DC were to be putting these collections together. We are a little behind the times in the UK and still only on Vol1 (US is on Vol4), anyway, I finally got my copy and I have to say, while it is fantastic to have 28 episodes, I'm EXTREMELY dissaponted that the shows are not in their original broadcast order.Disk 1 Episode 2 is ""Christmas with the Joker""... I mean, COME ON!! That was Episode 38!! Disk 3 Episode 17 ""See No Evil"" ... that was really epsiode 56!!So Warner/DC have started something they can never correct... I dread to think what vol 4 is like, they probably have a ""Batman Beyond"" episode thrown in for good measure!Check out www.tv.com for a full AND ORDERED listing."
5,Excellent!!!!!!,"This was my favorite show when I was growing up, I am glad they have decided to release it on DVD. I will be getting this set and any other that comes out, for the kids.... I don't have yet..... OK it's for me! :)"
4,What's IN IT??,All I can say is that the CD collection's box does NOT list which episodes are in the collection. Does it start from the first episode and go throughout season one? I just won't buy it if it's another mixture of episodes. Can someone please answer this?
3,"Was not in ""like new"" condition",The Batman Animated Series itself is an awesome series. No complaints there. The problem is that the seller said it was in excellent condition and it's not. I got this for my sons birthday and he was so disappointed when it constantly skipped. Shame on me for buying used and trusting the source. Pretty disappointed.
5,Batman the legend,The reason batman was awesome believe it or not was the Joker the best crinmnal mastermind. If it was not for a crazed maninc in my opion is the greatest evil charcarter of all time i'm not an evil person but when you think of all the bad guys they are all great but when you narrow it down the joker comes out to be the best but don't just watch the one's with Joker oh no NO they are all great but i just think that The Joker is the bestEnough about the joker now on with The Batman to me he is the greatest superhero of all time i mean he is a really smart gut with no powers or nothing he is just really smart and likes to work out a lot to me that is awesome because he has no powers and still whips up bad guys that is awesome
4,Every thing I wanted,"Everything worked fine. All the DVDs were in great condition, not even a scratch. My only complaint was it did take a little longer than expected."
5,Great,Great condition. Like new. I love the quality.Great DVD set. I highly recommend it. My boyfriend was stoked.
4,Death of a Dustman - a good read,"When Mrs. Freda Fleming decides that Fergus Macleod will be the new environmental officer for the village, it doesn't surprise anyone that his reign of tyranny ends with his dead body in a recycling bin. But the generally talkative villagers are strangely laconic and another murder only enforces their silence. Eventually Hamish is able to crack the tough nut, but at some cost to himself, when he gets demoted from Sergeant to Constable. Of course the demotion doesn't really bother him since he didn't want to be promoted in the first place.If you like predictable, then this is the book for you. Sometimes it is nice to pick up a book where the characters are like old friends, and this is the case here. The murdered people change, but the main characters are always there, and always the same. Take that as you like.Beaton is a good author but I think she is relying too much on a formula to write these books."
5,Highlander Hamish,"What I would give to live in a place like Lochdubh where the local bobby actually cares for his fellow villagers! This is the deepest I have been able to see into Hamish in a long time. I have read all of this series and just finished this one last night. Couldn't put it down! The end has a twist to it, not something I was expecting. And Priscilla is back! Lucky Hamish. Ms. Beaton has given much more depth to our ""bobby"" than in previous books and I appreciate it. Having been to Scotland, I can see how realistic this story can be and how closely woven the Highlanders are. Looking forward to the next volume. But WHY aren't the 6 episodes of Hamish Macbeth made for British TV available here? I would love to see Robert Carlyle lumbering about the village. What's up, BBC? When does America get Hamish in the flesh (so to speak)?"
2,Don't Waste Your Money...,"The storyline had potential but the filming and acting were crappy. This was highly disappointing and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it unless you get it real, real cheap! Watching this movie was painful..."
5,talk to your heart,this was my favorite for years and Ray Price is one of a kind he has a distinctive voice and he can still hold his own with the best ..he made a lot of good recordings and they are timeless
4,Used as oem replacement for my 2005 E46 M3,"These are the same oem spark plugs (NGK DCPR8EKP and says NGK R on the actual plug) that I replaced on my 2005 E46 M3. These were over $20 at my local bmw dealership, got these for around $10 amazon prime. A couple weeks have passed since installation, redlined the engine a couple times at 8k rpm and everything is working fine. Can't tell the difference in performance, but piece of mind that I replaced them with fresh ones. Replacement interval is 60k miles for the M3 fyi, and is part of the inspection II check."
2,No English,"I bought this without checking further details and as a result, I failed to notice that it's all in Spanish, with no English sub-title options.Despite this, I watched it.It's a very simple story of two guys who are room-mates who spot two girls on the street. Wether the girls are acting as prostitutes or not, I don't know but the four go back to the girls place.Unfortunately for the guys the girls are some kind of vampire/creature that eats human flesh.Not much more can be said for this as it was still dumb"
1,Horrible camera,I would not have purchased this stupid camera if I knew what kind of pictures it takes. They look awful. I wish I had not wasted my money.
3,Archaic,Comprehensive but lacks clarity. For the newbee this book could be confusing. Accounting theory has come a long way since 1970. Interesting reading for the accounting buff or lecturer in accounting.
5,Worked!,"2003 Ford Mustang GT - Blinkers / Hazards were flashing once and getting stuck, this was a quick easy fix."
2,Poor workmanship,"We bought this for my daughter for Christmas. The selling points were the lack of all the girly-girl cliche crap you see on most girl's bikes, and the fact it has a hand-brake, which she's already used to from her original push bike. We were out of town until just before Christmas, and this was a night-before assembly job. Thank all my lucky stars for friends who are serious cyclers and who know bikes, because this would have been a ruined Christmas morning. Both wheels were completely out of true and wobbled horribly, the chain-guard (cheap plastic) was uneven and being raked by the chain (from the factory, not part of the home install), and the brake mechanism is less than desirable. The worst is the wheels. We got them functional, but I won't feel good about them until we can get them trued up with a spoke tool. Until then, no longer rides. Don't buy this thing unless you know how to make it work at a fundamental level."
5,"IT ""ROCKS""","This cd is wicked if you like the older AC/DC,Rose Tattoo,Motorhead&The Godz then you gotta have this cd. They do a killer version of Twisted Sisters Under The Blade,even Dee Snider has to be proud of this version,They even do a medely of 2 songs by AngelCity&Alice Cooper. What a combo.And the orginals well if you crank it up too 10 & your stero don`t blow up then you got a good system,,Definetly a cd to play at high volumes.Nice to see there`s still bands like this out there banging away!"
2,Merely a collection of essays with a bold title,"Perhaps reading this book from the vantage point of 2006 is a mistake, but I thought I'd enjoy Drucker's big picture thinking about the topic of the knowledge economy. Drucker's discussion of the rise of the knowledge worker in today's society was only a quarter of this book. This book is really a series of essays that lacked coherence as a whole. I would recommend ""The Essential Drucker"" instead, to the reader looking for a good compilation of Drucker's insights."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Barion, if someone asks you if your are God, don't say yes?Apparently interfering in planetary evolution is not the done thing, so some of the former's colleagues summon him home for a good old fashioned trial.This leaves one of them left on Earth to give himself a promotion, and replace himself in the underworld sense with someone not to many people will be happy with, either.3.5 out of 5"
2,Disappointing array of Features,"This thing has been vaporware for as long as I can remember and now if it comes out this summer, it won't have near the options it should have. It doesn't have SMB support (windows directory sharing), it can't show GIF images, it has no Linux support, no FLAC support, no AAC support, no playlist support (i.e. m3u, asc, etc), no confirmed multiregion support (albeit someone will probably figure it out). It has some redeeming features like tv listings and games (who would want to play games on their tv anyway?). For the kind of money you'll have to pay for this thing (selling for $435 in the UK right now), the feature list falls quite short. Do yourself a favor and look into the competition (Zensonic z500) which provides (shipping internationally from AU or from US in July 2006) all the above support and more minus the TV listings (not that you'd use that anyway because you're really using this to watch time shifted programs from your server computer anyway right?)."
2,Don't expect it to play WMV-HD-DVD's !,"The device was announced with the feature to play not only 480p, but also WMV-HD DVD's with 720p or even 1080i. The product description does not say it can do that, so be warned: you might get a good DVD-Player, but don't expect it to feed the DVI-Connector of your Flatscreen-TV with WMV-HD in 1280x768 Pixel Resolution and progressive scan. It is max. 480p = 640x480 Pixel in progressive scan."
5,Great Memoir for Any Westerner Going to Live in Africa!,Mike Tidwell's memoir of his two years of Peace Corp work teaching villagers to build fish ponds is about so much more than that. He writes so honestly about what he learned from working closely with his African neighbors and how he came to understand their generosity from an African perspective as opposed to his American perspective. He has so many adventures with the men the Kalambayi region that each chapter taught me something new. Mike shares his doubts about himself and those he works with. He confesses his errors and shares his times of despondency. But all in all I think he feels the way that I do...living in Africa as an American is the best education because you are forever changed...your world of thought is so much larger. I wanted the story to go on and on because every evening I looked forward to being with Mike's world in Zaire.
4,A kind of book that every serious traveler wants to write,"Having just returned from a trip to southern Africa, I found myself nodding in agreement with many of Tidwell's keen observation of Africa. I was most impressed with his candor and compassion, and his obvious love for the continent of Africa and its people. The book communicates very well the kind of heartbreaking beauty and misery that coexists spectacularly in Africa. Highly recommended."
4,An enjoyable and enlightening read.,"I am full of admiration for the success the author had with his fishponds despite the local culture. I was also impressed by his honesty in talking about his lonliness and growing addiction to the local ""poison"". A very enjoyable book."
5,perfect case,I love the texture of the case and that it fit the phone perfectly. Its annoying when products say it fits the phone and it doesnt. This case was not the fact! it fit perfectly!!
3,"Hmm, what to do with all those old demo tapes...","The majority of this album contains a keys/bass/drums progressive-rock suite that just didn't do it for me. It really sounds dated (written in the 70's, actually), in terms of both concept and arrangement. The overall texture is a bit thin, and the playing a bit loose (although these guys are obviously very good players). The last two songs add guitar and sport a radio-friendly Asia/Journey type of sound, and are very well performed and produced. This album really appears to be just a collection of old demos. If these guys would get together and make some fresh new music, I'm sure they could make a great record."
5,Best music since ASIA !,"I just received the Monolith album and it just blew my head off! ""Mr. Personality"" and ""When Push Comes to Shove"" are simply the two best songs I've heard since I listened to ASIA the very first time. I hope this effort you've done doesn't stop here. These two songs have exactly the ingredients of why I fell in love with ASIA: very listenable and enjoyable music without losing the progressive musicianship. I urge everyone out there to buy this cd! Hope to listen more of Monolith as you have a new fan here. Best regards, Gerard"
3,Not their best album,I like The Quakes and they have recorded some verry good albums but this one is not that great. If you already have all the other ones and you like them a lot then by all means get this but if you don't I would reccomend buying some of the later ones first. The recording quality on this album is terrible and the lyrics aren't that great sometimes I think they released it before anyone actually listened to it.It's not all bad these songs are catchy as hell and after you listen to it once or twice you will probably like it. This is a decent album from a great band that released better albums.
5,"Very informative, and easy to understand.","Good description of illnesses and practises. Easy to comprehend the treatments for any particular problems, especially the CPR for colts."
2,Lightweight steel,These are pretty weak bookends. The metal bends easily and has difficulty holding up marginally large books.
1,Flimsy and getting worse,"MMF has cheapened their product until, for me, it is now nearly junk. I have lots of heavy reference books in a 9x12"" format and need bookends to keep them upright. Sets of 9"" ones from MMF that I bought about ten years ago work fine, but seemingly identical ones bought today bent over and collapsed. What is going on? I happen to have a digital micrometer. The ""heavy gauge"" steel from ten years ago is about 0.040"" thick (""about"" because there is some variation over a sample), while that from today's set is 0.025"" thick. Incidentally, an unused set from a year ago is about 0.030"" thick."
5,MATLOCK TV SERIES,This item was purchased as a gift to be given as a Christmas present. It would be difficult for me to review the merchandise at this time. I can say that I was very satisfied with the transaction.
4,Inspirational and educational,"This booked is written for the Christian reader and although I do not hold any strong religious beliefs other than following the golden rule and making sure my bed is made every day, I did find this book captivating. There are enough bible quotes and biblical associations to keep the devout reader happy and enough intelligent writing and autobiographical details to keep the layperson interested. Following the author though her struggle with addiction in her marriage is as heart wrenching as it compelling. By detailing her most inner thoughts and experiences, the author takes us on a harrowing journey through a marriage torn by drug addiction, mental and physical abuse and deceit. It is a long and painful contest that she and many others have been forced to endure. Her eventual triumph over these issues is a testament both to the author's strength and her devotion to her values. The author's success, words of advice and hope are an inspiration to everyone."
4,A gripping and passionate book,"Ms. Sims writes in a deeply personal way allowing the reader not only to connect with her story, but also with one's own emotions. This is a book about survival, hope, and forgiveness. The topic is difficult, and the author is not sentimental. There are moments in the narrative when it is so shocking the depth of Ms. Sims honesty and courage shine through in an ultimately pleasurable way for her readers. This is a book to inspire anyone working though difficult family issues around drugs and co-dependency. I highly recommend this book. It will leave you feeling renewed and empowered."
1,"Not at all what I had in mind, based on her title.","I did not care for this book. It is basically a story of a woman living with her alcoholic abusive husband. She talks about the trials and tribulations she goes through. A long part in the middle are just her journal writings, which were not useful. I didn't finish the entire book because I did not care for her style and the subject matter was not what I had been looking for. I suppose if you are married to an abusive alcoholic you might get something out of it. However, her Christian perspective is a little out there for me. I would not recommend this book."
3,Too charasmatic,"The first two chapter were very good explaining addiction, but then it became too ""God dependent'. God does play a very significant part in the recovery of the addict and the lives of friends and family of the addict. But I think the book dwells on that and does not talk much at all about other recovery areas. I have not read the other books, but am anxious to get started on Everything Changes."
5,"Beautiful Book, New Cond.",The classy look of the hardback cover is just perfect for the treasures inside the book. Thanks!
3,handy gadget but....,"Having an altimeter, compass, thermometer, stopwatch, clock, and barometer all-in-one seems handy enough. The unit seems to work well with one exception; the instructions say it may take 3 hours for the barometer/altimeter to correct itself after flight.My unit was delivered by air, and when it arrived the pressure reading was a full 3 inHg below the local weather station (reading 27"" rather than 30""). It took not 3 hours but a WEEK for it to slowly creep up so that now it reads about 0.3"" below the local station. Not sure how confident I am with it's minute-to-minute variation, and since it calculates altitude from this I wouldn't be skydiving with it..."
1,$90 junk,"The barometer is not even close, at least 5 inches too low. The altimeter won't hold either, in less than 5 minutes it can vary by a couple of hundrend feet.I should have gone with a better brand like Kestrel, and paid the additional cost."
3,Too complicated!,"This replaced an old-fashioned altimeter, which worked every time with no fuss. My husband has yet to get the altimeter part of this to work."
5,Great Entertainment for the Little Ones,"If your child is a Wiggles fan, this is a great set. It contains many new songs that will keep the entertainment going for a long time!"
4,"Great music, lousy packaging!",My son absolutely loves the music and dances around the house to it. It is a great value for 3 cds. The only problem is the plastic cd holders are lousy. My son used the item for two days and all were broken.
5,One Of The Best Games Ever,"My girl friend bought me this game almost a year ago, and since then, It has been hard to put down.From the great graphics to the superior gameplay this game is a must have for any PC user. With the included ""Construction Set"" one can make the game, basically, endless. Awesome enemies and remarkable AI makes this a tough game. I've spent well over 100 hours on it and I have completed most all the quests. Don't call me crazy, it is pretty easy to spend over an 3 hours before looking at the clock. The game can also offer Modification(MOD)s or Plu-in files from the internet. I really enjoyed the game, perhaps you will to.-hint-TGM"
4,Morrowind,"Amazing game, good story, decent graphics and at least 80+ hours of game play. Unfortunately my Morrowind CD came with this weird sappy stuff on the outside (I bought it new). Also my tribunal didnt work.Still great game I reccomend it to any RPG fan."
3,OK game.,This is almost the same thing as Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion. I would buy oblivion instead of this since it's much more updated and has fast travel instead of it literally taking you hours in real time to walk around this huge world in this game. Other than that it is a good game. I really liked the expansions that came with this. Still a good game though.
1,tech nightmare.,"This program is incredibly misbehaved. Although it installed easily it has been hard to use ever since.The minimum requrements are far exceeded by my computer, which works well with every other application I use. However, this application abruptly crashes the computer for no apparent reason at almost any time it is running. No particular place or time...just anywhere.The creashes range from simply freezing to the blue screen of death. No warnings, no explanations.I had the program installed on two different computers, and found the same issues occurred on both.I love Oblivion, which I have on my X-box, but this program is just too much trouble to keep running. Hopefully, the Elder Scrolls V will be developeda so that I can enjoy it on the X-box where it seems to run much better."
1,How did the editor of this book keep his job?,While this book was VERY hard to follow ( I'm a pretty technical guy when it comes to 3D) i WAS able to follow it most of the time. What really pisses me off is that it is a programming book and just about every page has a syntax error of some kind or another. Really mad about the fact that just as you think you're getting it there's a not always so obvious syntax error that the author and the editor and the publisher all missed!I spent more time troubleshooting the authors oversights then i did learning anything - WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? nobody buy this book until they fix all their little screw ups.
1,Full of errors,"It's ironic in a sad way that a programming book be filled with syntactical errors and painfully obvious the author didn't bother to proof read, let alone run, his code. I am a newcomer to MEL, but have been programming in other languages (C, C++, Python, Java) for ten years; I feel I've taken a step backwards insofar as my MEL progress is concerned. No one involved with this book has put forth the required effort and as such has done the MEL community a disserviceIf the code weren't rampant with errors, this would be the best MEL book out there. As it stands, it's the worst. At the very least, the publisher could have released the errata on their website as others have done.I recommend David Gould's ""Complete Maya Programming"" series as an excellent replacement. There's a reason this book is so inexpensive when purchased used. Don't waste your time."
1,Keep Looking!!!,"I have never purchased a book that has so many errors in it! Most of the script in the book and the CD will not execute. Plus the printed script does not match the script in the CD. The CD has VERY little info--to be exact, 18.9 Meg...The CD also has many missing key scenes and scripts. For an example if you were trying to create the ""grass"" project. My advice to you is: Go and buy other MEL books because you'll need it to decipher this project or another projects in this book. Try the animation chapter. It has 14 pages of script that is NOT included on the CD, type at your risk! I would get more specific but that would require me to write a book. I can't believe the people at CHARLES RIVER MEDIA puts out this [stuff]! This book is[n't worth the money].Try reading MEL Script for Maya Animators by Mark Wilkins and Chris Kazmier. It's a much better book with the exception of chapter 18. They even have a web site for errata. And the author will acknowledge your emails."
2,Covers The Basics,Don't buy this book if you are looking for some in-depth mel scripting. I bought this book and skimmed through it in less than 15 minutes. The book briefly touches every area of maya from lighting and animation to creating tools and GUI's with one or two unexciting examples for every chapter. If you know the basics of mel scripting you are ready for something more exciting than this book.
3,"Flawed, but informative.","For a while, I thought that there was something wrong with me. Now I know, from testing, asking around and reading the other reviews on this site that the book has syntax errors. A lot of them. It depends on how you want to look at it- I am going to finish the book, and pretend that it is giving me pseudo-code.The concepts seam to be right on, but like most things, don't take it literally. And buy another book."
1,Don't wasit your time on this one,"I have never purchased a book that has so many errors in it! Most of the script in the book and the CD will not execute. Plus the printed script does not match the script in the CD. The CD has VERY little info--to be exact, 18.9 Meg. Does the author not know that the current blank CD now can hold up to 700 Meg? For an example if you were trying to create the ""grass"" project. My advice to you is: Go and buy other MEL books because you'll need it to decipher the project/s. Try the animation chapter. It has 14 pages of script that is NOT included on the CD. I would get more specific but that would require me to write a book. I can't believe the people at CHARLES RIVER MEDIA puts out this crap! This book is worth no more than $... Try reading MEL Script for Maya Animators by Mark Wilkins and Chris Kazmier. It's a much better book except for chapter 18. They even have a web site for errata. And the author will acknowledge your emails."
5,Great Product!!!,The rubber on the inside of the ends really helps grip the books tightly in place. They are very reasonably priced as well.
3,Book Ends,"Recevied bookends, they were perfect. I put them to work right away.My friends like the product.Keep up the good work."
5,CSI:NY,I love the CSI series. I have all the box sets. They are really good to watch. Hope you enjoy as much as I do
4,Improved but......,"I purchased this along with seasons 1-3, they are all good, yes we have to suspend our belief in terms of how quickly DNA results are returned or how when trying to determine the location of a person in New York from a photograph or in Central Park we have to assume that the Lab has 3D topographical software or that they can match shoe prints from a picture taken by camera phone even though there is no scale.but enough of this, I love the show, my only criticism is that on ALL 4 seasons there is no ""Play All"" option on these DVD's, please? isn't that one of the reason for buying TV shows on DVD is no adverts as well as watching them all per disc like a long movie?"
4,Great quality and show,The DVD's were top quality and the show is great I gave it four stars because it can get a little far fetched at times and not because of the condition of the disks or packaging which like I stated was in excelent condition and the shipping was fast and right on.
5,The series CONTINUES to be great,"I have really enjoyed all the seasons of this CSI break off. It has become a total unique show in and of itself. Each year, the science becomes more amazing, the characters so unique and believable, and the episodes still ""edge-of-your-seat""-ers. The relationship between the characters is continually developing and interesting. Gary Sinise is so soft-spoken, yet tough, and encourages a comfortable relationship among the cast. I have watched many various CSI dramas, and this one is still staying fresh and exciting."
2,Would be a great toy... if it actually worked!,"The detail on this tank is good, and it seems to have enough power to move about. The size of the tank is also about right- not huge, but bigger than a typical store-bought RC car. I'm not sure if the problem we had with ours was the tank or the remote, but out-of-the-box, it would not go forward or backward. It would rotate left and right, so the tracks and motors are working fine. Turret also cycled up/down, and rotated left and right as it should. Sending it back for a replacement, and we'll try again.Again, good detail, pretty neat-looking, but in the end, another Cheap China Crap product."
4,I like it,"This book is informative and gives just enough information for a beginning level Anatomy and Physiology course. The lab manual contains labeling to better fimiliarize the reader with parts to the body as well as fill in the blank and matching questions. All answers for the labs can be found in the book, allowing use as a self guided tool."
3,Another supersized item.,"The glasses are beautiful, but I am disappointed. They are advertised as white wine glasses. I need to replace some white wine glasses of this design, but not of this size. Ours are 8 ounces, the new ones are 11 ounces. Had your write up included the size, I would not have bought them. I still have them because it looks like wine glasses have been made larger like everything else. Please note that for medical and diet purposes, a glass of wine consists of 5 ounces. If you can find some 8 ounce glass from Bormioli, I am interested."
1,A total joke -- save your money,"I recently bought two Tivos and for each of them I purchased one of these policies.After the purchases, I received emails saying the policies would arrive in the mail in 10-14 business days. That was in early Feb.It is now late March and nothing had arrived so I called the customer service number for the warranty company to find out where my policies were.The person I spoke with claimed that they did not send the policies out (despite their own email saying they did), and that it was Amazon's responsibility to do so. He was even helpful enough to provide me with Amazon's customer service number.I called Amazon customer service who told me what I already knew -- that Amazon did not send out the contracts. So I requested refunds.My advice: save yourself the hassle and time and don't buy policies from this flaky company in the first place."
1,Completely incompetent customer service,"I ordered the Toshiba DVR660 1080p Upconverting VHS DVD Recorder with Built-in Tuner and called NEW to see if my 4 yr warranty was for replacement. I don't want to have to wait for repairs and then the unit comes back still not working. The rep who answered my call ""Bremman"" questioned me for 15 minutes and still never told me what I called to find out. I asked for a supvr 5 times and he put me on hold for 5 minutes. then he came back said something and hung up on me while I'm waiting for the supv. If there is any way that I can find another warranty provider for this DVR I would buy it. Eighty dollars is way too much to pay for a warranty on an item costing $200.00! And for $80.00 I want no-hassle, stress-less, rapid, replacement service.If this is how they handle customers who just have questions, how do you think they will function when I require product service??? Scarry isn't it! Amazon...help!!!!!!!!"
1,A Bit Confused,"I'm not sure what I should say. This is a 4-year extended warranty on a piece of equipment. Was I supposed to receive something, like an acknowledgement that my payment had been received, plus instructions regarding what to do and whom to contact if the equipment fails during the warranty period? If that was what I was supposed to receive, I didn't. But I should have."
2,Bogus company,See my other reviews of this horrible outfit. DON'T buy the warranty from this disorganized bunch of idiots. I've detailed their ineptitude in other product warranty reviews.
2,Clearly not for beginners,This is clearly not for beginners. Thought I could learn a few things from this since I just started. Instructer goes by lessons too fast without fully explaining anything.
4,Great while it lasts but . . .,"This gate is sturdy, secure and easy to open for adults and grown children but not for little ones. It feels sturdy enough that we put it at the top of a small flight of stairs. Although the gate is mostly metal and sturdy, the lock mechanism is plastic. One side of the mechanism broke within two months of purchase. Now the other has broken and the only way to replace it is to purchase a new gate as the lock is riveted onto the gate and cannot be replaced."
1,DON'T BUY THIS GATE!,"Like several other reviewers here, our gate installed and functioned wonderfully for just over a year (i.e., until just after the warranty expired), then the unlocking knob broke. There is no way to fix just the knob/locking mechanism (it is riveted together). Recommend you pass on this one. I noticed they don't even sell it anymore at the Babies-R-Us or Baby Depots around here."
1,Does not hold up,Gate does not last for more than 3-4 months.... I bought 2 and one lost a knob after 1 month.... The second lost both knobs after 4 months... the gate worked great but does not stand up to heavy use
5,Awesome Gate!!,"We just bought this gate for the top of our stairs. My husband had it installed in less than 30 minutes. It is made of metal/steel and is soo durable and strong. Definately worth the money. We are very impressed with this gate. The ease of opening it and shutting it is so nice when going down the stairs or up. The little knob is so easy to turn for an adult, and too hard for a child. The nice white colored metal looks nice too compared to other gates I've seen. This gate makes a ""click"" noise to let you know if it has latched or not, which is very important because if it's not latched then it will not be able to do it's job- which is to protect your kids from falling! We love this gate! Highly recommended and definately worth the money."
5,You're gonna love this gate!!,"I had an Evenflo gate that didnt even last a year dispite the reviews and the gentle use. It was horrible quality and wasnt worth the time or money spent on it!! My husband and I decided to start looking for another gate to buy. We wanted something that we can mount so I started checking out the reviews. Not wanting to base the purchase on reviews only we went to the store and check out the quality ourselves. We saw a couple of good gates but this one stood out the most. Its everything parents are raving about and then some!! I got to tell you the quality is outstanding. Its quick and easy to put up as long as you follow the directions( even if you have uneven walls) and dont get ahead of yourself. If your looking for a high quality, sturdy gate thats actually childproof this is it!! So if you are in the market for a gate give it a try!!"
2,LOCK WILL FAIL,"HiWe bought this one in early 2004. It is built very sturdy. It lasted about a year before the lock failed. I called them up and they wanted some code off the plastic (Year it was made??), and I was told to send in the knob(s) and BAM I got a whole new gate sent out. NOTHING was said about me 'buying' a new locking mechanism.The explanation I remember was some supplier used the wrong plastic or something. Now the replacement has failed and I guess they arent bothering with explanations now, 90 days is it.If you want a short term gate that will break with NO notice and leave your house precariously divided, Then this is it.I am PO'ed because this is the second one to fail and obviously they have a problem on their hands (Since I now see I am not alone). They should just stop making them.Tony >:("
2,Satisfaction Guarantee? Couldn't keep that promise.,"I have 2 of these gates for my stairs, along with several other types also from this brand. I very much like the gates function wise, but their customer service ensures I will not purchase from them again. My top stair gate is defective, and stopped locking after 3 months. The company would repair or replace it once it was sent in. They sent me a mailing label, but I have to pay for packaging this huge gate. What ticks me off is that obviously this is a necessary safety product. Sending it in for repair leaves my stairs open for a month or maybe more without a gate. I'd like to send them the gate and go purchase another immediately. They will not reimburse me for a replacement. Obviously allowing my child to fall down the stairs for a month isn't an option. This is a poor excuse for a resolution. They manufacture and sell me a defective product, and I'll get top pay for it twice. Some satisfaction guarantee."
2,Broke After 18 Months,"The gate worked fairly well until it broke 18 months after use. The handle knob became stuck and you could no longer turn it to open the gate.While it was working, it did prevent our 2.5 year old from ever being able to open it."
2,Doesn't hold up!,"This gate only lasted through one child. The lock broke after, probably a year. Then we resorted to holding it closed with a bungee cord. Then the mechanism that stops it from swinging over the stairs broke, so now it is just a worthless gate bolted to our wall. This gate sure seemed heavy-duty when it arrived, but the plastic mechanisms inside just don't hold up, which I didn't expect for the price! So now I am shopping for a new, and different, gate!"
2,Agree with TRJamieson and Missy,Just an FYI: I have experience the same thing with the lock breaking. It started out with the latch jamming and being unable to turn the knob and now it just doesn't open. I called the First Years and because the gate is over 90 days old they will not replace the lock/gate. Other than dealing with that I loved the gate when it worked.
2,Good for the first year...then broke.,"I purchased two of these gates for the top and bottom of a long open staircase. The bottom one is still working but this AM the top one, as I turned the knob to get through, broke! The spring inside the sealed handle portion SPROING! Now the gate will lock but will not unlock, in fact, you can not even turn the knobs at all. Seems like this is a well-known issue so I will be interested to see what happens when I call First Years to ask about this. However, I am assuming I'll be heading out today to buy a new gate to replace it - but definitely NOT this one!FOLLOWUP - First Years is aware of this problem and upon calling them they had me read some numbers off the unit and sent me a whole new gate after having sent them them the knobs. Good customer service."
4,Great gate but latch not very sturdy,"We have 2-year-old triplets. As you can imagine, we need our gate and it has gotten lots of use. We purchased our first one about a year ago, and since then we've had two latches break. As another reviewer writes, one day you hear a click and it's no longer functioning - you have to climb over. I called the company and they said if you break the latch off the gate and send it, they will send you another latching piece which is easy to screw on (we bought a second gate and did this, before we knew that we could get the company to replace it). That's fine, but in the meantime, you are without your gate.Anyway we really do like the function of this in that the door swings both ways and the kids can basically hang on it and it doesn't move. It's very secure. They can't work the latch (but my MIL with arthritis also has trouble with it). However I do think that you can expect to replace the latch at least once during its use."
3,Good gate when it's not broken...,"We've had this gate for 3 years, worked perfectly until last week when the spring in the latch mechanism gate out. We bought another one because we don't want to reinstall something else on the banister and the wall at the top of the stairs."
1,Very frustrating.,"Two big problems I have encountered:The template provided mismatched the two sides so they failed to line up. I see some people haven't mentioned this, so I'm not sure why some templates would be correct, and some not, perhaps two factories? Not sure. I did triple check all measurements to make sure I didn't mess up, and sadly, the error wasn't on the customer side.Once I compensated for this problem, with new holes, one of the screws broke in half while trying to attach the locking bracket (yes, I pre-drilled and was tightening by hand). I would have shifted the gate over slightly, but our stairway setup doesn't allow for this. Basically one shoddy product component stopped me dead in my tracks.After reading about some of the other durability issues, and my own experiences, I'm wondering how this got such high marks in Consumer Reports."
3,width of gate,"I don't have this gate, but I noticed a lot of people complaining about how it doesn't have widths in the description. On the First Years website, it says ""between 29 1/2 and 44 inches"". Hope that helps!"
3,Disappointed,"I bought this gate because of all the good reviews that it got but i beg to differ. It took me 2 days to put together because I couldnt get it aligned, I didnt know I would need a drill to make holes for the screws.One thing I can say once I did finally put it togther it seemed very sturdy."
2,baby gates need to have measurments,When advertising a baby gate it is very important to have measurements available for the customers. I think it would benefit the company if this was available. I have decided not to by this and other gates from this page because of that reason only.
1,Loved gate but LOCK HAS BROKEN TWICE IN 2 YEARS!!!,"This gate seemed perfect at first, until the lock broke within a year. That was okay because the company was going to replace it, except for the fact that in order to get a replacement I had to return it to the company FIRST. During this time, without a gate, I used a pressure mounted gate that I already had(which is not acceptble for top of stairs) so I was a nervous wreck until I received the replacement. Now, after more than a year of having the replacement gate, this lock has broken as well!! Not quite sure what I'm going to do now because I really like the gate WHILE IT WORKS, but It's been over a year so I'll have to BUY a replacement. I'm looking into other brands....Very Disappointed Customer"
1,How many bad reviews does a product need before people stop buying it?,"I just noticed a lot of very similar comments posted here... For me, as with other postings, the knob broke 13 months after purchase (9 months after installation) and First Years refused to replace the part because it was out of the 1 year warranty. Based on the same issues being posted by other people, this is clearly a major design problem. Because of their refusal to accept responsibility, not only will I not buy this gate again, I will not buy a First Years product again."
1,Wish I could give it less than 1 star rating,"We have 4 of these gates. Three of them broke. The latch is flimsy. It is poorly made & can not withstand too much use although the main point of having it is to be able to go through without having to remove a barrier type or climbing over.When it breaks, & it will First Years customer service will tell you to remove the broken part & ship it to them at your expense (leaving you with no gate) & IF it is still under warranty they will send you another piece. Otherwise you are out not only the gate but the shipping expense as well.Off to find another brand but plan to stick with names that offer better customer service."
1,Breaks...can't be fixed,"Very disappointing. We liked this gate as it served it's purpose of protecting our little ones fro the stairs while we were upstairs. But as I read from other reviews, the dial broke and it is impossible to fix. I would not buy this gate again."
2,Lasted for 2 years then broke,"We purchased 2 of these gates. Each failed after about 18 months of fairly frequent use. We had the same issue that other customers have documented where the knobs froze. I will say that the gate (not the latching mechanism) is well built and sturdy. However, the latching mechanism/knob isn't the easiest to use and tends to fail over time. I would buy a different gate."
2,My lock broke too!,We got our gate about 5 years ago. We used it about a year with our second child. Well our third is now crawling and we just put it up again. After 3 days up our lock froze in the stuck position. I was about to buy the exact same gate since I was pretty happy with it before and I thought the age was the problem until I read the reviews. This is a problem that needs to be fixed by the manufacture. I'll be looking for a new gate now!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GATE!!!!!,"We were very happy with this gate for the first 6 months, until the lock broke. I called the company and they told me that the warranty was only 90 days, but they would send me a new gate as a courtesy. Guess how long the lock on the new gate lasted... 6 months. Now it's broken as well and the company told me ""tough luck."" I wish I had read the reviews, because now I see I'm not the only one this has happened to. This gate is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money on it."
1,Terrible gate!,"This gate only worked for 8 months and the latch broke! The company would not replace it because they only offer a 90 day warranty. They will not even let you buy a replacement part. They want you to buy a entire new gate. What a rip off! Don't buy this gate, it is a piece of trash!"
1,First Years customer service is BOGUS,"This gate functioned wonderfully until the locking mechanism broke. The ""First Years"" has refused to deal with it, saying it is out of warranty, and that the gate needs to be replaced.They base this upon the manufactured date of the product, not when I purchased it. Notwithstanding that, this is a product quality issue.My comment to anyone out there is never, ever buy a product from a company that doesn't stand behind its products."
1,Save your money for a better gate.,"We purchased this gate a year ago for the top of our stairs. It was relatively simple to install and worked well, until today. The push button mechanism that allows you to open the gate from either side broke, leaving us with a worthless barrier to climb over. I called the company and they said the piece that is broken is not repairable and the gate is no longer under warranty - which is 90 days. A customer service rep for the company said that particular piece does break from time to time. If you are going to purchase this gate, I would suggest having a screwdriver handy so you can take it apart, or at least push on the locking tabs, so you can get up or down the stairs and not risk going over it."
3,Great stair gate until the spring breaks in the knob.,We're on our second gate. The first one lasted about 6 months and it broke. Now our second gate just broke today. I'm very frustrated about it because when we took the first gate back to Babies R Us they didn't have anymore and were not planning on getting more. We ended up getting the last one in stock at Toys R Us. Now I'm searching the web for a better model. We live in a split level and have to have one pronto. My husband undid the rivets to try and get to the broken parts but he has not been able to get it working properly.
1,Try something else,"I too had the same problem many other's had with the lock breaking after 11 months. I called the company and they will gladly replace it for free...AFTER I send the lock in to them. Obviously when I break out the lock we will be gateless, so in the meantime I need to buy another gate to put at the top of the stairs. I'm stuck buying another one to get a replacement that I won't need!"
2,Great Gate - While it works,"I thought that the gate was very easy to install and worked great for the first 1.5 years. One evening I went to open gate and heard the ""crunch"" noise. The handle was frozen. Normally I'd take the handle apart to try to repair, but as other reviews point out, it is riveted so it cannot be opened. I was going to buy another gate so could use the same mounting hardware and latch, but with a new born, I don't want to be doing this again in another year."
4,3 years,"It works great - had it for 3 years with 4 kids. Only now has one of the lids managed to break it :(. But hey 4 years, what other product will give you 4 years. BTW, I did not experience the issues the other reviewers had."
2,Great until it breaks,"We've enjoyed this gate for about a year and a half, but the locking mechanism (the knob) broke and now we have to buy a new one. It has a one-year warranty, but it should last for at least 3 years -- from crawling to preschool. What really steamed me is that you can't just buy the part of the gate that broke -- that would have actually been okay (and I would have still given it 3 or 4 stars)-- but you have to buy a whole new one. It's just a bunch more landfill that the world doesn't need and more expense that I don't need."
3,Great gate if lock mechanism did not lock-up,I like this gate it is wide and sturdy.One problem the locking knob locks-up and will not open again.Had to change the gate twice.
2,"Works well at first, but. . .","We bought this gate three years ago when our first daughter was born. We didn't use it until she was crawling and moving around, so the gate has gotten about 2 1/2 years of steady, solid use. Originally, we found it very loud when it closed (we'd get her to sleep only to have her wake up when the gate closed behind us). We learned to close it quietly. About a month ago, however (we now have a second child who's just started crawling), the knob froze in the same way that others report. At first, it just locked in place, but we could manually turn the knob to make it lock, then the knob just stopped turning at all. (and with the height of this gate, it's difficult to climb over it and I won't do it while holding my younger daughter!)."
1,DO NOT Buy this gate!!!,"This gate is obviously a way for The First Years to make a profit & lose a lot of customers. The gate will last only as long as the warranty. Then the spring in the cheap plastic knob will break, usually in the locked position. The First Years will do you the favor of having you break this piece out of the wall, ship the handle portion of the gate to them to check manufacture date & then tell you that it is no longer under warranty. So you will be left gateless & out of luck. I have had three of these. Two to close off kitchen/family room & one replacement. All knobs broke. We are now prisoners in the family room & we get to lift the 35 lb toddler & the 25 lb toddler every time we wish to get in or out.Save yourself the horrors & buy any brand but this one. It's just not worth it to spend $60 for a gate that will only make it through the first year."
3,Safe but not so easy to install,"We bought this gate after reading the raving reviews about it and thought it would be suitable for use at the top and bottom of the stairs. While I do agree that it is a safe gate, the installation was not as easy as we were led to believe. My husband is very handy and knowledgeable about these things, and it took him an hour and a half (and a lot of swearing) to get this thing set up properly. If you're up for the challenge, then it's the gate for you. Otherwise you might want to consider something easier to install."
1,DEFECTIVE,"This product is nice at first but you'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you don't have to put anymore holes in your home. I've bought 5 of them over 4 years. We have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking. DO NOT BUY, buy something better and higher quality so that you won't have to replace in 6 months. PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW. IT WILL SAVE YOU."
3,"Works great, but knob too hard to turn for preschoolers","We bought the gate for the top of our stairs to protect our infant. The gate works great as others have stated, EXCEPT the hand strength required to turn the knob enough to open the latch is too great for our older 5 & 8 year olds. I had to modify the knob so they could get more leverage on it to turn it all the way. I think it would be a problem for an adult with arthritis as well. The manufacturer should redesign the knob and/or install a softer spring mechanism inside the latch."
1,Great...until the lock broke!,"I have been meaning to review this gate since I have been using it for a little over a year. Well, I now have good reason to write a review as the locking mechanism has become non-functional. I opened it up (no easy feat -- had to drill out the rivits) thinking there was probably a spring that had come loose. But unfortunately the problem was do to the poor design and cannot be fixed due to one of key plastic components breaking. This is quite disapointing since I have only been using this gate for just over a year. I would highly recommend *not* to buy this gate."
2,I too had the lock break after about 13 months......,"I loved this gate, but the lock mechanism broke in the lock position and there is no way to fix it. I am very disappointed and now have a pressure gate at the top of the stairs until I can find a replacement. Don't buy!Update: Since I had the hardware installed in the casing already I purchased another one of these...and another....and another. so far I'm on my fourth gate and each one has failed at almost exactly 13 months. Always the lock mechanism. It's too bad that they don't have a replacement lock mechanism for this gate. The good news is that I only have to replace the one part of the gate that contains the lock mechanism. Bad news is that I've had to throw away all of the rest of the new parts that come with it. Very environmentally unfriendly. If you haven't bought one...don't!!!!"
1,Lock is guaranteed to break!,"Like quite a few other reviewers said, the lock on this gate will eventually break - three of our four broke between 15-20 months after purchase. All in the same way, with the knob mechanism becoming stuck in the locked position. Seemed like a wonderful, simple to use gate at first, but what a total disappointment now."
1,Locking Mechanism Breaks,"Would not recommend this gate!!!!!!We purchased this gate to place at the top of our stairs. Originally we were very happy with it & even bought another one for our deck. Shortly after purchasing the second one, the locking mechanism on the original one broke and the gate was stuck in the closed position. Well, it's a few months later & the exact same thing happened to the second gate. I can accept that the first one may have been a fluke, but for the exact same thing to break on the second one is not a coincidence. I have contacted The First Years, and even though I purchased the gate in August of 2004, since I can't find my receipt, the warranty is only good for one year from the manufacture date on the gate, which was 11/03, so I am SOL.Would not recommend this gate!!!!!!"
3,Locking mechanism breaks,"I've had the gate for approx. 6 months, loved it until the locking mechanism broke. Now it's more a hazard - try climbing over it when it won't open to get out of the house during an emergency. Written to the company, hopefully they'll respond. Hope all that have one with broken mechanisms write too."
2,Great gate with a fatal flaw,"I've purchased this same gate 3 times over the last 18 months! It is a very simple gate to install and very sturdy. Works and fits perfectly at at the top my stairs. One major problem, knob/locking mechanism keeps breaking! There is no way to fix either since it is rivited closed. I would buy it again until there is a better gate on the market."
2,"Works well, then it breaks","We had better luck than some - the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out. Called customer service, and they said it isn't a replaceable part. Too bad. It was easy enough to install, and worked well up until it didn't anymore. The click is pretty loud; we found ourselves trying to close it two-handed to avoid waking up the baby. Disappointed it didn't last as long as we needed a gate - but my daughter is only 2 1/2 and I still need a gate at the top of the stairs. I'l be replacing it with a different product, obviously."
1,We went through FOUR gates!,"Please spend your money on a different gate. There are nice wooden stair gates out there that seem pricey at first, but after going through what we have gone through, I wish I would have gotten a different gate. We have twin girls in a bi-level house. A stair gate is a must. The 90 day warranty is a joke, because naturally, each gate broke after 90 days. Same problem with all four - the knob just wont turn. I will say - when it worked, it was nice. But read other reviews, and you will see the same problem over and over again. Shame on me for buying it again. It just broke this past Saturday, after six months of use. I will contact the manufacturer, but as in the past, I'm sure I won't get anywhere. If enough people complain, perhaps they will change the design. Again, please look elsewhere."
1,Lock will break! Do not buy this gate!,"We purchased two of these gates, for both the top and bottom of our stairs. They did work great for about a year, and then within 2 months of eachother, the locks on both gates broke. After reading other comments on this site, it seems that many other people had the same problem. I believe this will eventually happen to all the gates, since it happened to both of mine. I called the customer service line, and there is only a 90 day warranty on the gates."
4,Wonderful gate...while it lasts,"We have had this gate about 2 years. It WAS a wonderful gate. Recently the locking mechanism quit working and you can no longer open the gate with the knob. If you want a gate that might last you two years, then this is the one. It definitely was easy to use!"
2,Knob broke after 18 months,I agree with several other reviews that I have read. It is a secure gate while it's working. The knob broke after about 18 months and I am now searching for a new gate to block our stairs.(We also had to return the gate when we first bought it because of a broken knob straight out of the box.)
3,it's great -- for one year,"Everything you read here is true: The gate is great. Until it breaks. And the lock WILL break in about a year. We've been through two of them so far, and we have two more years to go to get through both kids' toddler years. The second one broke recently (predictably, after about a year). Now we have to decide whether to buy a third one, knowing that we'll need yet a fourth one to get through the next two years, or switch to trying something else. It's hard to believe we'd have to buy four gates to get through four years, but that's the way it's shaping up. The gate really is secure and convenient while it lasts. Just know that it's not going to last much more than about a year."
3,Difficult to open,"I'm a bit surprised nobody has made a comment regarding how difficult this gate is to open. It can be opened fairly easily when going up the steps since you have to push in and turn. But when you're coming down the steps, the gate needs to be opened towards you. It's difficult to do this when you are pushing the knob and turning. There isn't much to grip."
2,The lock will eventually break...in the locked position,This gate was great for our stairs until the lock broke. We had it a little less than 2 years and just locked up one day in the closed position when I was trying to get up the stairs with my little guy. I called Learning Curve and they said they only warranty it for 1 year... we didn't even put it up until about 6 mos after we bought it! They told me there was nothing they can do to help me. The lock mechanism is riveted closed so can't even try to see if it can be fixed. This is obviously not just from my use as I see others had the same problem (see other reviews). Keep that in mind as you buy...
1,Do Not Buy this gate!!!,"This gate works very well initially but the knobs will freeze, rendering it useless. I used it for about a year and a half before this occurred. I think the life of a gate should last much longer than that."
2,Great while it lasts,"We've had it for almost 2 1/2 years and loved this gate until yesterday when it broke...also in the locked position. Eventually I got it to unlock somehow so we could get through. It is now stuck in the unlocked position so we can close the gate, which is at the top of our stairs, but need to be sure our 2 1/2 yr old twins and 4 yr. old don't open it and fall down the stairs. We are buying another one only because it's easier to replace than install a new type of gate and needing to drill new holes in the walls."
2,If the inside were as sturdy as th outside...,"We appear to be one of the lucky few who have had this product last over a year--just over. As with the rest of the unhappy reviewers, the locking mechanism broke and left us with an expensive but worthless gate. We also found the company's customer service department to be lacking in critical ways, such as customer service. The one thing I haven't seen mentioned yet is what the guts of the locking device look like. Once you crack the thing open, it doesn't take a PhD to see that it's designed so that when (not if) it breaks, it breaks in the locked position. Great for minimizing the company's liability, not great for people who need a gate that functions for two to three years (read: everyone with toddlers.)"
2,ETDurkin,"We've had this gate for exactly 2 years. It worked great at first, but just this week the locking mechanism broke and it is now stuck in a locked position. My husband & I have to use a flathead screwdriver to open it. Several other reviews indicate the same problem. I'll be buying different model this time."
2,Worked great until knob broke,"As has been stated, once the knob breaks the company says you have to buy an entire gate as it's a none-replacable piece. Although they could simply replace that side of the gate and all would work accordingly. I drilled out the steel and looked inside to see a flimsy spring which had broke as well as a plastic depression on the back of the knob which had broken and did not mate with the internal plastic part. I will be buying another product after seeing this construction."
2,loved it- as long as it worked,We loved this gate!! Our oldest is almost 3 and it has worked great until last week when the locking mechanism broke. I hope that we can just get the section with the lock. With our youngest almost 1 we have to get it fixed quickly. My fingers are crossed that the company will be responsive.
4,Great gate while it lasts,"The knob/latch on this gate broke today... after a year.We have this gate in our hallway. It blocks the bedrooms/office/main bath from the living area/kitchen/sunroom. We keep the dogs and cats separate this way, since they don't get along. Because of the location of the gate, I'd say we open and close it about 30 times a day. At least. For $60, I think we got our money's worth.While it worked, this gate was VERY sturdy, easy to install, looked nice with our white walls, and most of all -- did the job. Recommended, especially for more low-traffic areas!"
3,Serves its purpose,"I find this gate to serve its purpose. However, I find it difficult to open. It is sometimes hard to grab the knob to open it up. I suggest you check other gates out first."
2,Function=A+ Features=A+ Durability=F,"We have 2 sets of stairs, so we have purchased 4 of these almost a year ago. The installation wasn't too bad and got easier with every one I installed. We love the way this gate works and by ever so slightly installing the hinges at an angle (i.e. not perfectly verticle) you can have the gate swing open or shut when it's not locked. Problem is that we have had 3 of the gates fail in the latch mechanism. One day you'll shut it, you'll hear a pop, and it ceases to function. You can't open it without jimmying it or taking it off the hinges. I expected better durability from this company. Obviously, they're not cheap. Anyhow, great gate while it works but you'll probably buy two while your toddler is growing up."
5,Perfect quick dip!,"We throw lots of parties and watch football all weekend in our house. This is great dip for a quick snack. It comes in a pack of 12. It takes sour cream and mayonnaise to make. You are suppose to chill for an hour, but we ate it when it was first made and it was good. We also had some 4 days old and it was really good too. So buy a lot of chips, sour cream, and mayonnaise and get ready for football season."
1,"Does not work on Windows 2000, Customer Service is Poor","I suggest you DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. It does not work on Windows 2000. I worked with Customer Service for about a month, purchased new CDs, got driver updates and other stuff.In the end they were giving me instructions that did not even match up to their product. I gave up and just backup up my machine with ROXIO one disk at a time using Easy CD Creator 5.I wish I had listened to the crummy reviews other people were giving Backup NOW! They should call it Broken NOW!"
2,made some CD-R coasters,"I used CD-RWs in my first attempts at using this program. I wanted to speed up the backup operation, so I switched to high-speed CD-Rs. The backup took over 40 minutes per CD, with verification and compression turned off, on 24X CDs in a 32X writer on a 1GHZ AMD system. The first pass at this, the system hung on the 9th CD. The second pass, the program reported problems with the last CD, the 10th. Did the same operation with Norton Ghost and had everything backed up in less than an hour! I have not tried restoring files from this program, so I don't know how reliable it is."
1,Does not work - either writing to DVD or restoring from HD,"Very buggy and very slow. Tested on both of my office systems. Does not backup to more than 1 volume in your DVD writer (lots of contact with NTI support, but no resolution ""it was my drive"" they said - so why is it specifically listed on their site as compatible?Most troublesome - did a backup to an extra HD on my system - that took all night to backup 20Gb!) and when I did a restore it froze after ""restoring"" for 12 hours. I am self employed and am my own IT person, so while not an expert I am a fairly advanced user (been doing this since 1984 and I have never had so much trouble and frustration). I cannot afford to loose my data, I would go out of business. So I cannot recommend this product and would advise that if you are really stuck, use the backup function in XP (it is fast - 1hr to do 20Gb and it restores perfectly - but only does backup to a HD, not a DVD writer)."
2,Good Product but don't bother with support,"I purchased after talking to NTI's presale phone number checking to see if it would work with my system. I a precaution, I also obtain new hardware that specifically matched there hardware list. The Back NOW! didn't not function on 4 different machine. Me and another administor called there help desk with no luck. The service person told us to reinstall(which didn't work) and blamed the use of third party utilities. Even though we repeatedly told the person none were used and the installion was a fresh clean installion, he refused any further support. The person finally stated no solution since the reinstall did not work. Later I tried on a machine at my home and it work like a chanp with absolutely no problems. It created a bootable cd-r with disk image in no time."
3,just ok,it was not as good as i thought it would be but its just ok. i have heard other polkas so i was a little disappointed
4,"Fine voice, charming recital.","I agree with the first reviewer. Aline Kutan has a quite beautiful voice, silvery, very secure, a joy to listen to. Her German could be clearer but don't let that put you off buying the disc. Everything is well-sung here but I think her ""Madchenblumen"" is not as characterful as that of Diana Damrau. Her pianist is outstanding. The disc is well-engineered with voice and piano nicely balanced. Disgracefully, Analekta have failed to provide texts of the songs. I bought this disc out of curiosity and will be adding it to my lieder collection, but mainly for the voice."
2,Very good price but quality is not that great,The cable works fine and tested good on all 8 wires upon receipt but one of the RJ-45 jacks broke (the lock-in place tab) as soon as I touched it. I still use the cable but I have to keep it in place with tape and re-plug the cable all the time ...
4,Just as I expected,"I have purchased many and all kinds of cables from Cables2go. I have never been disappointed. Everything always arrives on time, packaged properly, and works as described."
2,Not a Snagless cable,"The product I received was a Cat 6 white cable with molded boots, not a Snagless patch cable.I'm disappointed the product I received did not match the picture TheSmartDigital presented."
4,Beware of the seller!,"I bought 2 of these.- The first one, I didn't pay attention and get the default prime-eligible one. It was a from the seller ""PRO TECHGROUP CORPORATION"". I get a low quality cable, as other shown in pictures and reviews. Poor shielding and thin cable, you can get one for $8 in any hardware store. I sent this item back.- I then bought a second one, paying attention this time to select Amazon as seller (item is then a few $ more expensive) and this was a real ""cable to go"" with a proper shielding and gigabit transfer rate.5 stars for the actual cable1 star for the low quality one.4 stars final, be sure to select a seller you can trust, for $1 it's not worth the trouble!"
1,perfect if you are plug and leaving it,"If you are simply plug and playing, i dont have any problem recomending it. However if you are pluging and unpluging it for some reason ( in my case i connect it to my xbox and or switch to apple tv) the snuggle is very hard and it becomes a pain."
4,CAT6 Cable 100 feet,Best value on the internet for CAT 6 cables. Don't waste money locally at an electronic store or appliance store. They are 5 times the price. Time to get this product was a little more than expected but within the limits of agreement.
5,Exactly what I expected,I bought this cord to run internet to an xbox 360. It works really well. Great construction. No problems.
5,His Best!!,"Prince has a lot of albums that I would rate 5 stars, but I would say that this is his best. All the songs are great and each one sounds different. ""Shhh"" is a little weaker than the rest and the npg operator gets old after awhile, but other than that it's perfect. My personal favorites are ""P Control,"" ""Endorphin Machine,"" ""The Most Beautiful Girl In The World,"" ""Dolphin,"" ""Shy,"" ""Billy Jack Bitch,"" and ""Gold."" ""Gold"" is one of the most amazing songs that I've ever heard. It's worth the price just for that one alone! They really ought to put this album back in print. I'm pretty sure that the album went gold so it's not like it wasn't selling very well."
4,You people are loco.,"I'm not referring to the reviewers, I'm referring to the sellers on the Amazon Marketplace.A new Gold Experience cd costs 58.00-66.00.A used Gold Experience cd costs 20.00 AT LEAST.These folks know this album is out of print therefore are purposely driving the cost up. Capitalism at its worst.I want this cd, but I'll be darned if I spend an arm and leg for it. I can wait. I can wait for some record company to come to their senses and put this back in print."
3,This is a 'PURPLE RAIN' failure,"My God,what's happened to PRINCE. This is his first album as THE ARTIST... We'll THE ARTIST ain't no PRINCE and this proves it. Songs like the TEVIN CAMPBELL better version of ""Shhh"" and the great comeback on a different label of ""The Most Beautiful Girl In The World"" and the ballad no one predicted ""I Hate U"",I thought THE ARTIST was going to do another '1999' light years before 1999. NOT! Songs like ""Dolphin"",""P Control"" and ""Gold"" musicially sounds like the 'PURPLE RAIN' soundtrack. THE ARTIST ain't looking for originally like PRINCE would."
1,Very Overrated,"This album typifies Prince's output in the 1990's. Corny and cheesy.The segues in and of themselves are cringe-worthy enough, but the music at this period in Prince's career was that of a lost artist haphazardly chasing trends. He was completely out of touch and sales of this record reflect that. There is a small minority of Prince fans that like this record, but unless you are a connoisseur of cheesy pop, or a completist, I would advice to skip this record and most of Prince's 90's output."
3,Gold,"Some of the songs on this album make you wanta go hmmmm. However, if you LOVE his PURPLE BADNESS as I surely do, it is a MUST. There is a version of SHHH, previously done by Tevin Campbell and although it's not quite as soulful as his version, it's still worth having! Love The Most Beautiful Girl in the World ( who doesn't) and p control is one of those in your face kinda songs. If you have sensitivity to Prince's ""I'm doing it cause I can "" lyrics this one probably isn't for you. Over all, they try to gouge you for this one, be careful, you can get a good used one. If you're a collector of the still ever so funky baddest man on the planet, don't pass it up."
4,Best Prince album of the '90s,"While breaking no new ground musically, and being a far cry from his peak in the '80s, this disc is my personal fave Prince release of the '90s.Hardly a weak song in the bunch, the only really annoying thing are the 'computer' segues. What a great group of musicians Prince was working with in those days, Mike Bland on drums was probably the greatest asset (and the most missed in these days of the insufferable Kirky J.).Highlights: ""Dolphin"", ""Shy"", ""Endorphinmachine"""
4,A tightly-arranged LP which affirms TAFKAP's genius,"The Gold Experience is the best LP of The Artist Era. TAFKAP both updates and reaffirms his unique sound in cuts such as ""Endorphinmachine,"" ""Dolphin,"" ""Shy,"" and the ballad ""I Hate U."" He also makes some funky noise on ""P Control,"" ""Billy Jack B----,"" and ""Now."" This album shows that TAFKAP has a lot of gas left in the tank."
3,it was ok,"Fine if you like ""penny candy."" It was nothing special but was all right. If you want something special, this is not it. If you like the ordinary - go for it. Fast delivery though. Average candy."
5,Exellent book on SAP implementation,This book teaches: to avoid pitfalls in projects to effectively manage ERP projects to implement in time and within budgetIt is an exellent and practical book
3,it is useful to those who are new in management,i think more case study should be place in the books to allows reader understand the real environment.
4,Useful for those not in the know of ERP Project Management,"This book will prove especially useful to the ones not in the know of ERP (and not only ERP) implementation project management. It has a really comprehensive chapter sequence and it is easy to read even by people that have just a year's experience on SAP (or other ERP software). The key concepts -pointed out by the author - that make an ERP implementation succesfull are useful to both consultants & managers.For the ones already experienced in project management though, it is just a different opinion on the matter."
5,Brady Bunch,I love the Brady Bunch and now enjoy sharing them with my kids! I only wish shows like this were still on TV instead of the garbage they try to sell to our children! The only thing I wish is that the DVD included behind the scenes or interviews with the actors. Another fun addition could be vintage commercials that ran when the show was on! Long live the Bradys!
1,The worst season! The beginning of the end!,"The final season was the worst one! Even the Oliver shows were lousy. Oliver could be currently popular singer Clay Aiken from another life. Oliver's geeky character was just polarizing and distracting. And none of the main actors of the show provided anything exciting to the final season. It seemed that everything that was so good about the show went south and downhill. The only two shows that stood out was when they went to Kings Island amusement park in Cincinnati and when Greg's hair turns orange after using hair tonic in the very final episode! Much of season 5 was forgettable! Other than that, this is still one of my favorite shows despite this weaker season."
4,good season on brady bunch,"I liked this season of Brady Bunch best out of the rest. Although it has flirtiness and a bit of immodestness, it was a pretty good season. It has episodes of where Marcia gets her lisecence, Cindy sneaks into marcia's diary, Carol's nephew comes to stay at thier house, Greg graduates, and more. Good season. Good for families."
3,Not as good as previous seasons,"I love the Brady Bunch, it's a great show in general, with good values. I've purchased and watched all four seasons and am halfway thru season 5. In this season, the kids are obviously older, which is not a problem. Kids, regardless there age, have there normal kids problems. My problem is cousin Oliver. I have not gotten to the Cousin Oliver episodes, but I don't think that it's going to be the same Brady Bunch as it was before. There is something there that its not the same. I don't regret buying it though."
5,our love song,"This is without a doubt one of the most beautiful of Roy Orbisons albums.Get out the kleenex when you listen to MAMA, sleepy hallow, Love star You will Cry.A must have for any Orbison fan."
4,NOT SO RARE ORBISON,"THIS CD, ALONG WITH VOLUME TWO, IS A MUST FOR ORBISON FANS, BUT ONLY IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BUT HIS GREATEST HITS. IF YOU OWN OTHER ORBISON CDs, THEN CHANCES ARE THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE THESE ""RARE"" SONGS. THIS CD (ALONG WITH VOL. 2) CONTAIN SOME OF HIS BEST WORKS."
3,simple but light,"it's really a ""concise"" dictionarary,with only the definition of the words in stead of example sentences.But it's really a convenient dic. for bring out,even the hard cover edition.if you just want a dic. to help you sometimes,it will be a good choice."
4,Sexy and Fun,"This book is not for the faint of heart - if you don't like erotica or sex in romance books, this book isn't for you. Without giving away too much of the storyline, this was a story about a couple in an open marriage, showcasing lots of love scenes. The writing style was a bit different than i'm used to, but once I got used to the authors style, I did enjoy the book. A very sexy and interesting book overall."
1,World's Wildest Roller Coasters,Book is NOT worth the money charged. It is a small book and not informative whatsoever. I returned the book immediately upon its receipt. The description of the book is nowhere near what the book contains. My advice........SAVE YOUR MONEY!!
1,Wrong Product,Amazon shipped the wrong size notebook. No problem... returned the product.Amazon is a great merchant...will buy from them again.
4,Everything as expected,Everything was as I expected. The product was to my standards and it got to me sooner than I expected.
1,Becarful no suitable for A4 or letter size ACECAD digital pad,"Becarful no suitable for A4 or letter size ACECAD digital pad, it is for A5 size digital pad. please make sure before buying."
4,An awesome book recommanded for any violinist,"I am a classically trained violinist ( Level: Advanced- But NOT Expert ( Heifetz)). Since I have moved to the US, I have been playing Bluegrass, jazz, folk ( Balkan), and persian music on my fiddle. I got ""Gypsy Violin"" book with it CD in the mail on New Years Eve. It was the best gift that I could get. I haven't been able to put the book and my violin down since then.I have a little complain about the CD though. I wish the Violin was recorded on one channel only, so I could practice with accompaniment."
5,Great Gypsy Fiddle Book,"There are a lot of beautiful songs in this book. Some are easy, some are difficult. The CD is very nice, great fiddle player!"
5,This book is a real treat.,The CD is excellent--very nice to listen to in its own right. The written music is very nicely arranged. I've enjoyed playing some of the songs. Having them on CD is a real help.
3,Name Change,"i saw this movie when it was released in theaters, back in the mid 70's.....the funny thing is that the original title that it was released under was ""MANEATER"". and yes,...around the same time ""JAWS"" was out. but the ending could have been more..."
5,Simple tool well made.,I like my armstrong ratchets so I decided to pick one of these up. Seems to be well made although there is not much that can go wrong with these.
5,I'm a believer in Oil of Oregano (Wild),"Five years ago I almost died from a bacterial infection that went to my brain. I was used to recurring colds, flu, infections, sinusitis, bronchitis and ear infections several times a year. After the last one almost did me in, I discovered Oil of Oregano and have never looked back.At the first sign of a cold, sore throat or toothache/abscess, I resume the treatment with the oil. I use it mainly during winter and sparingly the rest of the year. Drink lots of water! I also learned to maintain a more alkaline system by eating the right vegetables and foods, while avoiding white sugar/flour/refined salt and foods that create a more acidic system.Reading through the other wonderful testimonials, I have to agree with almost everything said. There are countless benefits to this wonderful oil and I always keep a supply on my shelf."
4,Cold & Flu Remedy,"I was referred to this product, by a family member, because of their belief in its ability to combat the common cold. We bought it, tried it, and are now believers in it too! Oil of Oregano is especially effective if taken at the first onset of a cold. Taken then, it has been our experience that our cold symptoms go away after just one or two doses - and never develope into a cold. If not taken at the onset, the cold developes and requires 2-3 days of Oil of Oregano treatment to remedy.3-5 drops mixed into a glass of juice or beverage is the dosage we use. It has a bitter, strong taste - but the results justify the bitterness. Since colds are so common here in the NW, we keep this product on hand and recommend it to family, friends, and co-workers. I know of no better remedy for a cold and, since we began using it, it has become our ONLY cold remedy. It works that well for us."
4,Great stuff,"I like this stuff, worked well on cold sores and dries out other minor irritations nicely. If you have sensitive skin just start with a small amount first to see how your skin reacts."
2,Decent product but bad service,"When I received this item I heard it rattling around in the package before I even opened it. After opening, I discovered that the ring/lid was busted so that the rubber seal inside was exposed. There were not any pieces in the box so it had to be knowingly mailed in a damaged state. The whole box smelled like oregano oil. Thankfully the rubber didnt completely come off so there was still product in the bottle and the product itself seems to be no different than another strong brand I buy..nevertheless, this did not make me feel confident to buy from this seller. I only home it was an oversight and not intentionally selling me a damaged product."
1,too weak,If you are looking for a good quality oregano oil get a Taliamed oregano oil which comes from Greece. This one looks like a child play compared to a potent Talia Oil.
3,Be careful...it is very strong,"I took a few drops mixed in water. Be careful,this stuff can burn the back of your throat. Make sure it's mixed up good. I wrote this as a 3* because I know many people don't trust the 5 * reviews to be credible. And this product has a lot of them. I havn't tried any other liqued oregano oil product, but this company has a great reputation, and the product is really strong."
3,oregano,I can not get past the smell of oregano.....can't tell if it works or not...unable to use......
4,Good Product,"Whenever I feel like I'm coming down with a virus or whatever the ailment is, I will take oregano oil with echninacea;Good N' Natural Olive Leaf Extract + FREE Echinacea Goldenseal Drops (Alcohol Free - 1 oz.). My mother use to give us these products when we we young and for the most part we were pretty healthy kids.I've continued this habit with my family and we are also a pretty healthy bunch. Both products are an excellent source for boosting your immune system and I definitely recommend everyone have some type of immune system booster in the house for yourself and your family."
1,Ugh....can't take the taste.,"The taste is so strong, I couldn't use it. And forget about adding it into your food.....it gives a disgusting taste."
4,Strong stuff!,"Even mixed in EVOO, this stuff is strong, which is a good thing because you know you aren't receiving a heavily diluted product. You are getting most out of your money for this product. As for its effectiveness with detoxing and/or killing pathogens, I have no idea if it works or not, as I have not really tried it out for that purpose."
2,not so komfy,The pillow is very nice to look at. Actually I use it for a couch pillow instead of for the dog. It is way over stuffed for the dog to get comfy on. I would not buy another one
2,"Great content, formatting leaves a lot to be desired","Charlotte Mason's material is great, and it's certainly a good bargain to get all 6 of her works in a single volume at such a low cost.However, the formatting in this book is below the quality I've come to expect for Kindle books. The original volume and page numbers from the paper edition are stuck throughout the books as part of the text. So right in mid-sentence, you often get line breaks and then text that says something like ""vol 2 page 21"" -- then the sentence continues on. This pattern appears regularly, hundreds of times throughout this collection. It doesn't make for the easiest reading experience. If all of those items were removed from the text, it would make for a much easier reading experience."
1,Not what i ordered,Really didn't check it out it just showed up was not impressed with that aspect of this app. Would not have bought it.
2,"The quality of this publication (cardstock-like paper, layout, etc) makes reading difficult","These books are very small, the margins are very narrow, and the paper is very thick and stiff, like cardstock. It makes casual reading more work than it should be. I plan to return these books and order a more expensive, higher quality printing of Mason's work."
1,too old fashioned for today,It's too old fashioned and not what I needed for high schooled kids. The language is out dated. It was a disappointment.
4,"Pretty Good, But Not Wilson's Best","In my opinion I feel that Wilson's FENCES is his best play. I've read THE PIANO LESSON and SEVEN GUITARS. August Wilson is an EXCELLENT playwright who truly captures the African American struggle with such humor, satire, irony, hope, and sadness. This was a good read, but not one of his best to me."
3,Patch Cable,Not much to say about a patch cable. Nice positive snag-less snap. It worked when I plugged it in. Reasonable price.
3,Important Subject; Dry Writing,"By stating that the minimum wage should be at a certain level, the authors dated their book, erasing some of the impact it could have.Unfortunately, it reads too much like a report to Congress--or as an extensive research-term paper. The authors quote author Barbara Ehrenreich's NICKEL AND DIMED (2001), but they didn't get their message across as emotionally as she.There are just too many charts and repetitive figures thrown at the reader. I could not plow through the whole book of predictable dry prose. And it really doesn't say much more than the better-written NICKEL AND DIMED.Though sympathetic with the authors' causes (but basically to raise the minimum wage) and even outraged by the research, I found my eyes glazing over. I assigned the book three stars not because of the freshness of the writing, but because of the importance of the subject."
3,Decent,"A little ""poppy"" sounding. I only bought this for 1 song. This is basically Journey minus the vox and bass player."
4,A classic .,"Tasteful is the first thing that comes to mind when listening to this album,dominated by John Waite's great vocals and superb phrasing and Schon's great fretboard skills and taste."
3,Journey/Foreigner crossed...,"This band's style of music is a blend between the classical rock of Journey and the more upbeat sound of Foreigner. For example, Ready When You Are sounds like a Foreigner song! I was given the CD to listen to by a friend -- good CD, definitely doesn't live up to it's potential. It lacks an original sound."
5,EXCELLENT!!,This is a GREAT book...I will read and re-read and purchase several copies to give to others...especially to people who are wandering or struggling with what do with their lives...when I give them the book I will be telling them that they have to read just the first 2 chapters...then decide. For those that feel they are already on a good track it's a great refresher and a great way to stay focused - plus lots of good ideas to move you along the path to success!
1,A spirituality book,"I bought this book based on the ratings here and kept wondering if it was a spirituality book instead. I recommend other books instead for Career management such as ""What Color is your Parachute?"", ""The Career journey by Ram Iyer"" and ""Who moved my cheese?"""
1,"Wanted a Lesson on Success, Found Bible Preaching Instead","I thought I would be reading a reasoned account and finding solid tips for success. According to this book, only Christians can ever be successful. Couldn't delete it from my Kindle fast enough when I hit Bible quotes. If that is your thing, go ahead and read. I will be finding a different book to read."
3,Well presented,There is alot in this book to read into. Several leaps but no real bounds.I think if you are serious about commiting to goalsetting this is the best book to have at your disposal.My suggestion...set the goal of following the ideas presented in the book before you read it.
5,One of the Best,One of the best goal setting / life planning books out there. There's a ton of good ideas in this book.
5,Life Changing,"I've never written a review before, but I have to with this one. I've read some of the 3stars and below, all stating that this is regurgetated information. This may be true, except that Newberry's approach is interactive. You do the exercises and you THINK and you CREATE. You don't simply just take in information.I also found the book to be quite motivational and comprehensive covering topics ranging from getting your mission statement, to effective goal setting, time management, affirmations, visualization with amazing tips and techniques for each. Newberry leaves you lacking nothing.I've also read his first edition which completely CHANGED my life, business life, personal life etc. This edition seemed to have more biblical quotes than I remember the last one having (which bothered me a tad). But I have to say.. This is one of my all time favourite, best books ever. Practical, concise and thorough."
2,Feels like you're reading the Bible,"Would be better if it didn't have Bible passages every two pages. I have nothing against the Bible, but if I'd be into reading biblical self-help books, I'd seek one out instead of reading a success story interspersed with biblical passages.When the first biblical passage appeared, I thought, ""nothing wrong with this, the author is simply citing a very relevant and important book."" But then there were mentions of inspirational words from the priest of your local church, and then another biblical passage, and another."
2,Not Impressed,"I read self help and motivational books constantly. Found this to be quite elementary with no value to me. The book also jumped all over the place, with no fluency. Found reading it more of a chore than excited to read the next chapter. Do not recommend."
2,Bizarre,"If you follow the instructions in this book, you're in peril of fast becoming an automaton with OCD. This guy must have a real issue with cognitive freedom, and the experience of freely associated thinking. It's nothing that hasn't been said before by countless others, and I didn't appreciate the constant references to the Bible- should have been more upfront about that. Sorry, have to run, I just had a bowel movement and I have to write that into my schedule."
2,I am a success,The book was interresting but I find it interesting that the club referred to in the book is ony for peopole making 6 figures.Do they realy need the basic exercises that are in this book? I thought this was for people fresh out of school or those choosing careers far from their area of experience.
5,A perfect beginning of the year read!,Newberry provides the basics of everything that you need for goals- setting and achieving in one package. I appreciated the bullet point approach to details that were worth taking notes on. My copy is bleeding yellow from the highlighter.
5,Goal Mapping,"I write this review because of the significant impact this book has made in my life. I've read other books that guide the reader through the process of goal setting and visualization but never have I experienced a book that gave such clearity to walking me through the process of accomplishing the task.Success is Not an Accident, provids a step by step system that is transferable and simple to comprehend and guide others through. I belive that Tommy's insights and explanations motivate the reader to take action.If you are looking for a book that will take you through the mental exercises to make a paradigm shift and change your life this is it."
2,"Would be a good book, except...","so many biblical references. I couldn't get past the first chapter without feeling like the author looks down on anyone who isn't Christian. I am going to look for a book where every other sentence doesn't try to remind you that ""God loves you"" and insists ""God's help"" is a major factor in success. Blech. If you're not a Christian, this book will get old very fast."
1,More preaching than actual advice.,"This book mentions God exactly 100 times. Depending on your expectations, this may be a good or not so good of a thing in a book on success. Just know what you are getting if that's not your cup of tea. I know I wasn't expecting that."
4,Great Book!!,"A friend suggested this book for me. I have started a business and this book has helped me stay focused and encouraged. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT BOOK."
2,Lost my interest,"Great premise, but too much verbiage for the message. I usually don't set a book down until its complete. This was one of the few exceptions.-Sorry...."
4,Book review,This was an easy download. The book has some great information on setting goals for your life and being a success. Have to start young to accomplish.
5,A Book with Guts,"Tommy Newberry's book, ""Success Is Not An Accident"" is one of the best business books I have read in quite a while. His no-nonsense approach has certainly made me look at how I approach business, life and accomplishments in a different light.The book includes workbook areas for introspection and planning. I also found it to be a useful reference. It makes you take stock in where you are, what you want and how to create your path to get there. Its honest observances and insightful delivery make this book a 'must have' for folks in business, homelife, or college."
4,On the line,Very well written. The author does a great job developing the characters. I like that the characters follow through the series but it is a good read alone book also.
4,Great Read,I really enjoyed all the books in this series. The author writes authentically about fire fighting and I love the interactions with the characters. I like that we were able to learn more about the characters through the 3 books.
5,colin's classic card games,Great graphics and a lot of fun. I can now beat my friends in hearts! This guy has it goin' on! Buy it now.
4,Isn't this the truth!,"Any one who is or has worked as a therapist will be able to relate to the humor of this book. You will be able to see your patients, academic advisors and co-workers in the spoofs. We have to be able to poke fun at what we do, otherwise we could never do it. This book is funny, but not in a laugh-out-loud way."
3,King of the historical novelty songs,"""North to Alaska,"" Sink The Bismark,"" ""Johnny Reb,"" and especially ""The Battle of New Orleans,"" are all fun little history lessons courtesy of one of rock's originals; Johnny Horton. This collection's really just a primer with just 25 minutes of playing time. In today's age of the 74 minute CD, this is a major rip. If you can't find this one at a major discount try one of the more extensive collections. That being said this is a lot of fun. Horton has an expressive voice with a lot of range and the songs range from borderline hilarious to some fairly good rockabilly.It's a shame he met an early death; there's definitely some real talent here."
4,Can children use this?,"The small format of this book enables it to be carried in a pocket and encourages students to make notes in the book. The focus of the book is on introducing each event in a 1-2 page format so general Olympic information is kept to a minimal amount. The book excels at small lists such as the host cities, the calendar of events, 100 Years of Olympic Highlights, and the event logs on each page. Beside each event is the 1996 winner and team, the olympic record if appropriate, and blank lines for the 2000 winner. This book would be useful for individuals and as a springboard for more intense Olympic titles."
4,A Winner for the Beginner,"Although the material here is dated, ""Olympic Summer Games 2000"" gives a good review of all the events, including 7 pages on aquatics, 10 pages on track and field (including Olympic records), and 1-2 pages each on such diverse sports as Badminton, Judo, Wrestling, and Volleyball. The small book is beautifully produced with color illustrations of track venues, foldouts on ""100 Years of Olympic Highlights,"" winners from 1996 (and places to write in the year 2000 winners), and a brief history of the Olympics. The descriptions are very brief but appropriate for readers around 7-11 yrs or so. The book has over 60 pages, with informative captioned pictures, and a schedule of all the games at Sydney. Let's hope that a similar book is published for the next Olympiad."
4,GET READY FOR THE GAMES!,"This is a great record keeping book, for children and adults. It has colorful pictures, shows the internationnal symbols for each event, and even tells who won the gold medal in 1996. The streamlined size makes it easy to take anywhere. I am going to need to get more for the rest of my nephews and nieces!"
5,Large Passion,"A large passion guides these poems from the first line to the last. From tragedy to simple pleasures, an entire range of human emotions is chronicled in this unique collection of poems. Beyond Heart Mountain is a moving experience; a great addition to your library and life."
5,A new voice not to be missed!,"""Beyond Heart Mountain"" is a powerful first book. These poems bring together history and the personal narratives that are shaped by the forces in the world around them, and, in turn, shape identity. Lee Ann Roripaugh's craft is only surpassed by the intelligence she brings to these explorations of the human heart struggling against the rejections the world can level against it. Her prose poems, graceful narratives, and sensual lyric poems are equally able to contain heartbreak and humor, disappointment and celebration. I highly recommend this book."
2,Disappointed,"Disappointingly, this book is full of formula errors. This book must be used in conjunction with a formal Structural Analysis book in order to check and or correct many of the formulas given. This book does give you a broad over view of Structural Systems, but do not rely on it to be correct. My firm has both this book and the study series by Kaplan. Suffice it to say, Kaplan's Structural series is a much better study guide and so far I have found no formula errata. My Structural Engineer Colleagues can not believe that this book by Steven E. O'Hara and David Kent Ballast ever made it through any type of pre-production review with this many errors.Updated 12.15.2012: To be fair, the Kaplan book was not perfect either, but, in my opinion, was still a much better study guide."
1,Mildew sprouts,"I bought this seed sprouting system because I love sprouts and had a different system many years ago. My seeds sprouted okay, but they kept mildewing! The watering system is terrible. If you don't keep a constant eye on them, they either dry out or rot. The directions do say that they should be rinsed 2 times per day, but that is too much for me (I have a family and household to take care of). I'm throwing it out and trying to find my old sprouting system."
5,huge Alvin Fan,My 3 year old loves Alvin as much as I did. This is a great collection of their shows. We have enjoyed each one of them.
3,missing the really good episodes.,This one was ok I guess but was missing 2 great Alvin episodes that should've been in it. The Berlin wall epissode and the one when he loses his luckey hat. Those 2 have history. I was Tres dissapointed not to find them here.
3,It's a start,"Overall, it's a good collection of selected Chipmunk episodes. The downside to this set is it is not a season set. What's sucks about this set is the price. For 14 episodes I think the DVD should have cost only $9.99 instead of $19.99. Try to find it for cheap or used."
3,"Nice, but some flaws","I installed a few of these units. The overall design is very nice. They replace existing switched without a problem. There are however a couple of issues with these:They incorporate a feature that limits the full voltage going to the lights. This saves energy, but lower the intensity of your bulbs. This a a big issue if you are using L.E.D. bulbs at an already limited wattage. There should be a way to bypass this, but there isn't.I purchased masters and slaves and found that they are not consistent in their design. The masters have two indicator lights that are on all the time an orange and green L.E.D. The slaves only have the orange L.E.D. on when they are actually on. I contacted the company and they said they have gone through design changes. You would think they would be consistent throughout their designs. Bad choice."
2,"If you like buzzing, then buy these","They work great--if you like hearing a lot of buzzing. No kidding--a single unit emits an audible buzzing sound, which gets louder the dimmer the light setting. Imagine if you had more than one unit within earshot of the other? Holy buzzing, Batman. For what it's worth, these barely buzz at all when off or completely on (i.e., with no dim). But, doesn't that defeat the purpose of a, you know, dimmer?Other than the buzzing, these look and work great.Strongly discourage purchasing these dimmer switches. Bought seven of them today from Lowes; returning them all tomorrow. This is a serious product fail. Can't even believe they can mass-produce these."
1,Garbage,if i could i would give this a rating of 0 this is just like the old get ya mind correct but diffrent beats the material is old and just another way for paid in full(partial)records to get money off of chamillionaire this album suck i advise no one to buy this garbage
3,Sylvania triple combo,"This unit is made by FUNAI Corp. Curve of CRT cuts off news ribbon on bottom of picture. Has no previous channel button. picture could be sharper, adjusted to max sharpness. ..."
5,Soothing on a sore throat,"I love these when I have a sore throat. I don't usually buy food with artificial sweeteners, but these taste good (no artificial sweetener taste), and they aren't bad for your teeth. I only take them once or twice a year when I have a sore throat, so it's not like I am eating a ton of sweetener (plus, they are so small, the whole bag probably has as much aspartame as 1-2 diet cokes.). They are very soothing on a sore scratchy throat."
3,Odd taste,"I love the taste of lemon and I also love mint, but the two together just have an odd flavor."
2,Contains Aspartame and 8.5 calories each drop,"This was my email reply from Ricola:""There are 17 calories per severing (2 drops per serving)"".Because this contains Aspartame I will no longer buy them."
3,I had to write the words.,"This was the ninth album released by the reclusive Jandek. It sounds a lot like his previous eight albums. Most of the first half of the album features Jandek accompanied by a drummer, while the second half features Jandek solo. It is typical Jandek, featuring out-of-tune guitar playing and off-key singing, with songs featuring indecipherable lyrics and no melody. Most people will hate it, but Jandek's handful of fans will like it."
5,Great Looking Earrings!,"I loved these earrings, they are my favorite pair of earrings that i own, the size is just perfect, and they look great with everything , even bluejeans!"
2,limiting,"I have studied this course for about one year along the Perfect Pitch. The training basically consists of being able to recognize harmonic intervals and sing melodic intervals. Basically it's a string of intervals without any musical sense whatsoever. I had no problem with that, until I have read something from an Arnold Schoenberg book about this type of ear training. Schoenberg said that he saw various students that were very good with this kind of exercises. However, in his view, ''training the ear in this way without training the musical mind, will not be of great help.'' That changed my view immediately. Music is not made of a string of perfect fifths. So what's the point of practicing a drill that consists in singing a string of perfect fifths?While this type of training might be worth doing for a few weeks, by all means do not make the same mistake as I did : working on it for almost an year. I now train my ear only on real music, and it is this that I find very valuable."
4,Better Than Sun Sign Compatibility,"I really think that more people should do Mars-Venus comparisons rather than those tired old sun sign comparisons. And with the handy charts in the back of the book, even people who keep forgetting their sun sign will get the most out of this book.My problem is that I don't like the idea of matching one person's Venus sign with another's Mars sign, and vice versa. I've found that I get along better with people whose Venus matches well with my Venus, and whose Mars matches with my Mars. I have a Mars-Venus square, so that's probably why...Nevertheless, I got a kick out of reading about celebrities who have the same signs as me and my friends (and love interests). It's astonishingly accurate!"
3,Good but not great,"So the muffler does closely resemble the original, and functions as intended. However, if you cut off the old muffler and want to just put this on the original pipe, you will need to make or buy a short extension because the inlet pipe on this muffler is not long enough otherwise. Then you'll want an additional exhaust clamp or a welder (preferred) to make the connection. If the inlet pipe were a few inches longer the muffler would be perfect."
1,Disappointing,"Lightweight, simplistic treatment of investing in apartment buildings. If you're serious about this subject, other books on Amazon are a better bet."
1,Weak - not much substance,"I have read a lot of books on real estate investing. There are a few good ones out there that give real detailed, REAListic advice. This is not one of them. It is not very specific and I did not find it to live up to it's title of being a ""step-by-step guide"". There is not much substance to the book and can't say I learned anything by reading it. I'm a beginning investor with only a few years of experience, and the book was below my knowledge level. The author may be experienced and successful, but not everyone is an expert at conveying a message. I do not recommend this book."
2,Light reading,"I've read a bunch of real estate books since I bought my first apartment building in 1975. This is a light weight book for beginners with no real examples of actual deals made by the author. That may be fine for single family houses that any amateur can buy and manage in his spare time. When it comes to buying a 25+ unit apartment building for a million dollars or more, you better know a lot more than anything in this book. The book makes references to a web sight that seems to be abandoned, making mention of upcoming events that were six months ago."
3,You don't have to entertain me.,"This is a Jandek album from 1983. Almost all of the songs feature just Jandek's voice and his acoustic guitar, or just his guitar, in the case of the instrumentals. The one song that features an outside musician is ""John Plays Drums"", which features somebody (presumably named ""John"") banging away at the drums. This is a pretty typical early Jandek album, although the songs are shorter than usual, with only two songs being over three minutes long. Jandek fans should like it, normal people should hate it."
4,My daughter loves this book,"My 16-month old has been fascinated by owls ever since we bought an owl puppet from costco. Anyhow, we got about 5 books out of the library about owls, all for toddlers, and this was definitely my daughter's favorite. It's pretty simple and straightforward, but has all of the facts in it, like that scientists like to study ""owl pellets"", that owl eyes don't rotate in their sockets, and that they have soft feathers to enable them to fly silently. The text is well-written. And of course it has some nice pictures of owls with mice and frogs in their beaks. It would be nice if the pictures were laid out bigger, but we are very fond of this book."
3,Nebraska 24/7,"The book has nice photos, but seems dated. I expected more scenery and less people shots."
3,Very usefull,"Most of the items in this come in handy except for a few items, the extra plaques wont fit most houses, they are to plain, the vcr protector is made for some very old vcr's, I have a sony vcr (yes I still use casettes) and it won't fit in the hole, the rests is very well thought."
1,Terrible,My daughter is after everything in my house including electric outlets. I don't have the hole for screw in outlet. What's the point of this product at least they have to provide with sticky tape. Knobs cover and corners are garbage not useful.My advise put something heavy behind outlets and other eclectic devices to keep your child away from it.
1,Blows!,"These things are junk! I bought two 2 packs of these, and the first one each cartridge lasted 3 to 4 weeks. On the second pack one of the two in the pack never worked, and the other lasted 2 weeks... Buying these is like taking your money out, and throwing it out the window of your car on the highway!"
4,A very fun and entertaining movie about Country Music,"I really liked the cameo appearances by Trisha Yearwood and Pam Tillis. K.T. Oslin did a great job as Lucy, the proprietor of the restaurant/club ""The BlueBird Cafe"" that the musicians auditioned for Saturday night performances. Sandra Bullock, as Linda Lue Linden was hokey, but lovable. I really wasn't that much impressed by the late River Phoenix as James Wright. Samantha Mathis plays a roller-coaster ride role; who just can't make up her mind as to what she really wants in life (the career in singing isn't that obvious). Still, a very nice movie about the hopes and dreams of would-be country singers; and also the songs of Trisha."
4,Love the cast and music,"I had seen this movie earlier on tv and loved it. I am glad that Amazon had it. To me it was an enjoyable film with country music (that I heard Phoenix helped with) and also had a love triangle. I just love River Phoenix and Dermot Mulroney and thought they did a great job, as well as Sandra Bullock and Samantha Mathis. There is very small nudity and a couple of swear words. All in all great film."
4,The real Thing Called Love,"The Thing Called Love is about a real place in Nashville (The Bluebird Cafe) and is very true to life about the experiences of the young songwriters who come here to try to make it. Nashville doesn't have quite this many cowboy hats or this much line dancing, but the heartbreak and the excitement that is the daily life of the up and coming artists is right on. You might want to read more about the real place in ""The Bluebird Cafe Scrapbook"" which has a chapter about the making of this film. Also, some of the real artists in it have great albums out, including Kevin Welch and Pam Tillis.I highly recommend this movie for people thinking of moving to Nashville to try to make it."
5,It's about time!!,"Love this movie, love the songs. Just really great, have been waiting for the dvd for years can finally get rid of the vhs. Such a good cast and a really good story. So worth seeing again and again!"
1,Hard to believe Phoenix ever agreed to do this film,"This film, is rather simple in terms of character, plot line and dialogue. In short, this should have been a lifetime movie, why Pheonix signed on to do this movie is a mystery. What a waste of time."
1,"won't evn play,keep getting region error,3 other people tried on their's,tried changing their settings still wouldn't play.","Can't write a review,couldn't watch movie because of region errors,now telling me I have to use ten more words before I can submit,How can I decribe movie when couldn't watch"
4,COOL...IF YOU LIKE SENTIMENTAL LYRICS,"""MAYBE THE GOD IS A WOMAN,TOO."" THIS IS THE MOVIE ABOUT KNOWING ONESELF BY ONESELF. IT IS PRESENTED BY THE LYRICS, SO YOU'D BETTER CONCENTRATE ON ITS LYRICS MORE THAN THE APPEARANCES OF RIVER PHOENIX. OF COURSE RIVER IS COOL, KIND OF GREAT CAUSE THIS IS MORE THAN HIS ACTING. AND IF YOU'RE FAN OF SANDRA BULLOCK, YOU ALSO CAN SEE HER FRESH APPEARANCE. DON'T MISS THE FINAL SONG, WHICH IS SUNG BY SAMANTHA MARTIS. IT'S THE MAIN THEME OF THIS MOVIE, I THINK."
2,This Nashville Is Dullsville,"I was lured to this picture by the star power of the late River Phoenix and director Peter Bogdanovich. They can't breathe life into the meandering script about fledling performers trying to get a break in the Music City. Another problem is the central romance between a narcissistic Phoenix and an absolutely wooden Samantha Mathis generates zero sparks. The film's lone saving graces are nice supporting turns by young Sandra Bullock and Dermot Mulroney. Also good is country singer K.T. Oslin as a sarcastic club-owner. Do yourself a favor and check out the recently departed Robert Altman's ""Nashville"" instead."
3,Over-rated,"This was River Phoenix's first adult role, but it's nothing to write home about. Sandra Bullock was new here, too, and you'd never suspect she'd become a big star from this. It's a country-western boy/girl love triangle with some just ok music performed by the actors themselves. Reminds me a bit of ""Urban Cowboy."" It's not terrible in any way, but why it's a bit of a cult fave, I'm not too sure, other than for the last look at the soon-to-OD Phoenix."
5,The Bluebird Cafe,"I loved this movie.. It is a must for all those die-hard country music fans because it gives a little insight into how some of todays country music stars probably started.. A few years ago I visted the Bluebird Cafe where most of the movie takes place and found even Garth Brooks played there at one time.. After seeing the movie, trust me, you'll want to hang out up there.. All in all, this movie was a wonderful slice of the Nashville scene.."
3,RIVER`S SAD SWANSONG,"I saw the film on February 1994, just months after River`s passing... I though the experience of seeing this film was a horrowing experience: The River Phoenix I knew was gone. This was just a shadow. His talent was gone; he did indeed look stoned. However; many of my friends new to River love this film and not the others. In this film he comes across as a grown up, off-beat and dangerously on(or over)the edge. To say this is a performance is an overstatement. He seems to walk though the role and it i s a credit to him that he still had that much presence that this should be considered ""great acting"". The mileu is richly detailed(even a cameo appearance by Trisha Yearwood)and the singing abilites of River and Samantha - quite refreshing. For us who loved and grew up with River - this is not a film u ought 2 see. As for the others, it`s OK."
4,River Phoenix gives a good peformance in one of his last,"Samantha Mathis (Pump Up The Volume, Kids in America) stars as Miranda, who comes to a small town hoping that others can hear her songs that she sings and maybe perform in front of a bigger crowd. She winds up taking in friends, Linda Lue, played by a cute Sandra Bullock (Crash, Speed), sensitive Kyle, played by Dermot Mulroney (Wedding Date, Where The Day Takes You) and the shy but talented James, played by River Phoenix (Dogfight, My Owen Private Idaho) in one of his last roles and he's very good here. Mulroney grows in love with Mathis but Phoenix winds up marrying her and theirs tension between the 3 of them. The songs are creative, the cast is great...enough said, this is a great movie and I recommend it. Also starring Anthony Clark (tv's Yes, Dear, Boston Common) and Trisha Yearwood."
3,Good foundation for professionals entering the field.,The need for correctly trained professioals has never been greater. This book offers a solid starting point.
5,Great bedtime story for toddlers,My daughter absolutely loved this book from about 2 years to almost 4. She gets such a kick out of the animals and their bedtime rituals. The illustrations are so cute. A bedtime favorite!
4,Very good video for home use.,"This video provides most of needed information for new breastfeeding Moms. I love that it contains compared good and bad latch, positioning, sound of baby swallowing and the interactive quiz. The only thing I wish I'd known before I bought this video is that it is only meant for home use and not as an educational film, which I was hoping to use in my breastfeeding class. It doesn't state this on the video package, just as the opener copyright statement. :("
4,a Russian World,This collection of Pushkin's short stories includes his masterpiece-The Queen of Spades-as wellas some of his other best stories. The translation is excellant. This book is recommened.
4,It works as advertised,It works ok for the price. probably would not last long for everyday use but for the home handyman it is fine. The lubricating oil is rather pricey.
2,Well written but tedious - Brighter Than Gold is much better,"This novel makes a great bedtime read. After ten minutes you will be fast asleep. With 300+ loooong, boring pages to go you will have many nights of deep sleep to look forward to."
4,Great Book!,"This book was recommended reading for my Divemaster (YMCA). The text contains valuable information and should be on the shelf of any well-informed diver. Some of the procedures within are either not safe or not advised with modern SCUBA but I still gained some valuable insight. This was a good companion to my SLAM manual and I would still recommend this as a good read for the class. I caution anyone, however, from using some of the procedures that are no longer used with modern scuba!"
5,Finding Nemo V-Tech game,My son is 3 years old and he loves his Finding Nemo game for the V-Tech V-Smile. He has learned so much about ocean life. He amazes us every day with the new things he has learned. I would recommend this game.
1,I am mad!,The directions were very hard to follow.I could not make one thing.The author left out many steps.I would have gave it 0 stars if i could.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!
3,too difficult for my son and me,My son wanted to have a challenge but this is too challenging for him. I can't really help him either I have a hard time understanding the directions and it is too dificult even for my oldest son who is verygood at origami.
4,I loved this book!!!,I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I read the first book and had to read this one too!!! I wish there were more to the book though.
4,"Amazing, confusing, & interesting! Overall a good book!","I really liked this book because I love fantasy & found this one unlike any fantasy I had ever read before! I,unfortunately, read this one first. But I can't wait to read the first one! If it's good as the second or better than I hope to read it right away!! I had lots of friends who found the cover confusing & many who thought I was reading it upside-down! I found this book unusual, but a wonderful book to read! Especially if you like fantasy, then this is the book for you!"
3,Appropriate for grade 6 -8,"Picked this up at a used book store in the fantasy section. I wouldn't pay cover price for it.This book has an idiot plot, a plot that only works because the characters are all idiots. Once I got past this, it has a few good mindkicks and reality riffs in the second half.The entire plot falls apart if any of the characters with incredible mind powers suddenly imagine themselves wise and smart enough to solve everything. In the case of mind controllers, simply convince an imaginer to do it.In the right frame of mind, knowing the characters are all idiots can be amusing. While they may be stupid, they sure are brave. I wouldn't expect any deep revelations from this work. Additionally, unexplained details abounded. Perhaps because this book was a sequel and they were explained in a previous book."
5,A great book to read after Of Two Minds.,"More Minds is the sequal to Of Two Minds, with the same sense of excitment and adventure. Princess Lenora and Prince Coren together try and save the balance while, at the same time try to work around their doubles to save the kingdom before it comes to a fatal end. This is a wonderful story that should be read by all."
4,A good recollection of that horrific day,"The author, an editor at the New York Times, takes the reader into the events taking place shortly before, during, and after the Twin Towers were hit by airplanes on that horrible day in U.S history. We learn of family members going off to school and work and then searching for one another, employees of the Towers rushing down those many steps from their high-rise offices and the emergency workers climbing those stairs to reach victims. The black-and-white photos poignantly tell their own stories, including firemen carrying a deceased Fire Department chaplain who had just given last rites to a fireman and then lost his own life. A well-done addition to any collection."
2,"uninvolved, non-emotional, superficial narration",I just finished this short book. It contains a few black and white pictures that were and are available in many places. The stories are broken up throughout the book. The writing is such that there is little drama. It is very factual and narrates only facts in a very detached manner. Luckily it is very short and I didn't waste much time on it.
3,Mostly for Country Music Fans but With Missing Hits,"All ten of the tracks peaked in the top twelve country tunes. Only four charted on the Billboard top pop singles, but two of them charted high.For what looks to be a ""best of"" CD, there should have been a lot more tunes. Missing top ten hits are (with their peak chart positions):A Very Special Love Song - 1974 - (Country #1, Adult Contemporary #1, Pop #11)I Don't See Me in Your Eyes Anymore - 1974 (Country #1, Pop #47)I Love My Friend - 1974 (Country #1, Adult Contemporary #1, Pop #24)She Called Me Baby - 1974 (Country #1, Pop #47)Everytime You Touch Me - 1975 (Country #3, Adult Contemporary #1, Pop # 19)"
4,Wish it was available locally,"Great for bottle cleaning, fits where other dish mops do not. Cleans better than spongey dish mops. Long lasting.Actually, I'd give it five stars, but I hate dishwashing, and do not want to encourage it."
1,Not great at all,"I ordered this cd and what a disapointment. Having been a Stonewall Jackson for a long time, I could not believe thechange of voice. His voice at it's best was when he recorded""Wild, wild wind"" and ""A wound time can't erase"". No onecould even come close to this. ""Thirty links of chain"" oneof my favourites to this day is of immense quality. Too badI don't have it on cd. I have seen him on stage just once inmy life and enjoyed his performance."
4,It works,"It provides good protection from the sun. It's fairly stable even during windy days.The assembly instruction is not very clear: the first time it took me almost 1/2 hour to assemble it. Otherwise, it takes 5-10 minutes."
3,Trouble with Installation,"This tent is a little bit easy to install indoors, terrible in real outdoor beach conditions. Had to do it by myself. The stakes are plastic, but good for sand. Once up it was great it is like a mini tent. After breaking it down it was hard to stuff it back into the pouch it came with."
3,A real pain in the you know what to put together,"I was really excited when I got my beach tent, thinking that there is no way this could be hard to set up, well let me tell you, I was wrong. It's a real pain in the you know what to set up, esp by yourself. First of all, it really surprises me that the Coleman company would chose netting material to put the poles through, it tears too easily unlike the tent material itself. I had an easier time putting together a three person tent, which is three times bigger than this beach shade. I don't know if it's because it's an unusual shape or what. Anyway, once I got it up after much frustration the thing was great. I guess in some way the frustration was worth it in the end, but not sure I really want to go through that again. I might try to give it another try to see if I can get fast at getting the thing assembled, but if not, well, it will be for sale soon."
5,I like this thing...,"I was looking for an inexpensive shade for the beach and I found this. It worked great. We actually used it to lay in. We did not put the chairs under it, but it is big enough that we could have. I was impressed by the size. It is easy to put up and take down. The only thing is that I was not quite sure how to fold it. It is not like a tent that has right angles, but I just rolled it up and stuffed it into the bag. No problem easy as cake! I would definitely recommend this to others. I trust the Coleman brand and so far I have not had any problems. Thx"
2,Disappointed,We have used this beach shade twice. On the second use one of the poles broke so we can no longer use it. Also the first time when used it we were missing to stakes to hold the front door down.
3,Lots of room but hard to set up,"It has ample room, and looks like it would provide great shade, but it's too much of hassle to set up. A SportBrella XL is smaller, but take less than a minute to put up, so I went with that."
5,Baby shade,Good shade for baby and pretty easy to use. It sets up quick and easy. Fits 2-3 adults and a few kids. Make sure to use the sand bags when it's windy!
2,Not for the ocean beach,"Well, this item is a good concept, just not at an ocean beach. This might be good at a lake where there isn't much wind. It was such a pain to put up because it was windy. And even when it was up we had to pile all our stuff inside to keep it from blowing away. The sand bags weren't much help."
2,Quality Nightmare.,"I camp a lot and this shelter makes tent #6 for me. After reading all the great reviews, I purchased this in order to have our infant on the beach. I don't know what Coleman was thinking. The sleeves that you insert the fiberglass ""poles"" in to are made of a weak mesh. The metal tips on the poles ripped through the mesh the first time I set this up on the beach, and only continued to rip as the vacation went on. Forget about setting it up in wind. I'm disappointed with the product."
3,Great weekend beach shelter,"Think of it as 1/2 a dome tent. Its a pretty decent setup and well made...maybe not completely beach ready tho.Sand in the shock poles can make it next to impossible to take apart at the end of the day and the whole thing doesnt drain sand_at_all. Get ready to do a lot of shaking.If you plan to be on the beach for the entire day, its a great shelter to bring along. If you're going down for a few hours, just bring an umbrealla. This would be a little too much effort to put up and tear down."
3,Give Me Shelter,"Not too difficult to put up after a little practice. Gave the shade that I was looking for but second use, shock cord broke on main pole. Warranty should cover this but a hassle to send back after only 2 uses."
3,Difficult Assembly,We liked the beach shade but the set up was similar to setting up a camping tent and we found this too difficult to manuever with 2 small children. It was more complicated than we cared to deal with and returned it to Amazon.
2,Not a quick setup,"We bought the Coleman Beach Shade recently and found it is so difficult to set up that we end up using our little beach umbrella. We wish we could exchange for a Sport Umbrella which handles as easily as a regular umbrella. The Beach Shade is definitely not a ""popup"""
1,5 minutes to set up,"The sleeves you slide the pole into to set the tent up are made of some cheap mesh that tore as we were sliding the pole into it on our 2nd use. Now every time we use it we have to lay across the tent and make sure teh pole in that sleeve doesn't push out of the growing hole. We camp a lot and use lots of different tents. We bought this for an open beach shelter. I found it takes a long time to set up for only 34 poles and the poles must be pushed gingerly or they will tear right through the sleeves. Otherwise its a great large roomy shelter that if you use the stay lines, it will probably stay up in a moderate wind (as long as the sand is not too soft). My wife will not use it because it takes too long to set up."
5,Great buy!!!,"We bought this for our trip to Maui. It was light and easy to take with us and to up. It allowed us to stay at the beach and be protected from the direct sun rays. Others on the beach had smaller tents, but this one worked the best of them all."
4,Great Product to Unwind & RElax at the Coastline,"I took this beach shade last week with me at Ocean Cove in NOrthern CA - I set it up by the cliffs, overlooking the pacific ocean. I was experiencing heavenly bliss sitting on my lounge chair, reading my books, and I had a 180 degree view - and witnessed the migration of the whales. About the product: very easy to set-up. The poles did get caught on the net during set-up and tear down. Taking this product to the next level - use a solid material instead of a net - and set-up will be SO FAST! I also had only 6 very light stakes - so I purchased 8 heavy-duty ones, and they worked great. My dog K.C. (first-time camping) loved it too. I recommend this product AND Ocean Cove for your next camping trip (15 miles north of Jenner. $19 a night!) Have a great time with your outdoor activities relaxing, recuperating and getting re-charged!"
2,Coleman Road Trip Beach Shade,It is OK once it is put together but it is one pain in the neck to put up.The sand bag idea was not thought out. It needs to be secure to the ground before you can even start thinking about erecting it. We had a hard time with it using the stakes into dirt so I know it would not be fun putting up on the beach. We wound up ordering another tent. I wish I could return it.Brian Cianfrani
2,Expected Better quality,I hope my experience was just an anomaly but I was very disappointed with the quality of sewing and strength of materials used in the supports.The anchors are very light gauge and bend very easily when hammering them in.The stitching at the securing points were poorly done and missed at the end causing the tent not to lay flat and the post to slip out.The support bars don't lock together making it impossible to pull the bars through.When the bars come undone they can split easily making the entire structure lop sided.The material is very thin and does not radiate heat as well as other previously owned tentsFolding the canopy neatly is next to impossible.Looks good when it's up and design is well thought out even though poor executed.
4,very good beach/picnic shelter,"This shelter takes a lot more effort to errect than the pop up shelters but it is worth the effort as it is much sturdier, you can also zip up the door to make a privacy screen for getting changed."
4,Coleman Road Trip Beach Shade,Great protection for our 10 month old daughter. Held up very well in the wind. Our only complaint we would have preferred clips instead of sleeves for the poles!
5,Perfect,"This thing is a little tough to put up (for my wife... I had no problems, I did it in a 15-20 MPH wind alone) for comfort and shade outstanding, easy to clean, folds up very small. I had a two month old on a beach... NO SUNTAN OIL NEEDED! I would suggest this."
4,Coleman Beach Shade,This was a good purchase. Excellent design. It worked well for my pale skin and allowed the privacy for my baby to sleep. Assembly is easy with two but more challenging solo especially on a windy day.
4,Seems great,We cancelled our trip to the beach so I cannot comment on the actual usage but assemble was much easier than I expected. I can imagine that it would be difficult to assemble in the wind. The shelter was much larger than I expected. I can't wait to take it to the beach!
5,Best shade for the beach!,"This is an incredible product. If you can put a tent together, this is easy to put up. We loved using this shade on our latest beach trip. It is comfortable, enables the kids to get out of the sun, and is very roomy. This was our best beach purchase!"
3,Very Hot!,This took awhile for my husband to set up with a screaming baby on the beach! After it was put together it was super hot inside. Nice idea but not for small kids and definitely if you do not have help to set up.
1,Received a Defective Product!!,"I just received this today. While the shipping was exemplary the tent was BROKEN! One of the 2 shock-corded, black, cross poles was broken (the cord inside the pole was snapped!!) Needless to say, I'm not happy AT ALL because I purchased this for a trip to the beach that is scheduled for THIS WEEKEND (in 3 days)!!!! I just now attempted to call Coleman, but of course, I have to call back during regular business hours! Even if they replace the part, how will I get it in 2 days, before I leave for my trip??!! This is EXTREMELY frustrating and disappointing. I'm shocked and appalled that Amazon would ship a defective product!! I am NOT HAPPY with this experience AT ALL!!!"
5,Great for a day at the beach,"This shade is well worth the price. We braved the beach with a 108F heat index and the kids loved it. It's a nice escape from the sun and large enough for four (two adults and two kids.) My only difficulty was trying to set it up in a moderate wind. Once up, the supplied sand bags and stakes kept it up all day long."
3,More Trouble than its worth,"This beach shade was okay- maybe- if you are going to live on the beach. If your planning on using it for a few hours to shade children or yourself, it's more trouble than its worth. It sets up like a tent, you have to extend poles,thread them through slots (not very durable slots) and then stake it down and/or use sand bags to keep a mild breeze from making it a tumbleweed going across the beach.Its just not worth it. It takes 2 to set it up, and the time involved is more than than its worth for a couple of hours."
5,Our beach vacation would have been terrible with out this,"I bought this tent about a year ago for about $40 (I see that it pretty much holds its price and for a good reason). This tent not only looks nice at the beach, it drew a lot of comments from fellow vacationers, but also very resistant to wind. It was pretty winds and I was afraid it wont be long before we are forced to fold it down, but no this thing survived the wind and protected our daughter, just under a year old at the time, from wind and sun the whole day! We wouldn't have had enough fun without it. I highly recommend."
4,"GREAT BEACH SHADE, TOOK AWHILE TO ASSEMBLE","We purchased this beach shade to use with our toddler at the beach. It held up just fine and provides ample space for us to lay down and have the baby crawl around in. However it took about 10-15 minutes just to set up on the windy beach and if I were to purchase a beach shade again, I'd consider an instant pop up one to save on time.It's quite a hassle to have to wrestle with this thing when you have a small child. Other than that, great product!"
5,Best beach investment ever,"This is my first product review ever.With a recent trip to the beach, I wanted to have a portable shade to keep myself and friends from burning to a crisp. I'm really happy of this purchase.Pros:Small carrying bag with attached instructionsFast and easy setup. Less than 10 min.Room for 3 adults. I'm 6'9"" and was able to lay comfortably on my side within the tent aloneLove the rear screen doorSand bags and tent pegs were a plusStrategically placed mesh pockets within the tent to hold personal belongingsLess than $50 for a great product to use over and over again.Cons:None really. So far I just used it once. I'll update once I put through it's paces."
4,Great beach tent,Great tent for the beach. The pockets to fill with sand/rocks to stabilize it help a lot. The best thing it has that others may not is the ability to completely zip up the front to change if needed.
4,Perfect for the Beach!,We recieved this shade supper fast!! And we love it!! Went to nags head NC and it was a bit windy where everyone that had an umbrella had to hold it down but we were comfortable sitting in our tent! Although it can be stuffy when the back window is zipped down. It would be nice if it had upper side windows for more breeze to come in. It is very compact. But need to fold it really good to put it back into the bag with the rods. It has alot of room inside. very easy to set up and bring down.
4,Casual Beach Goer,"Was not disappointed with this product purchase. Great value.Pre-Purchase Selling points when compared to competitive products:- UVF rating- Full floor- Front and rear zip-able doors- Relative pricePost-Purchase Selling points- weight & size- Ease of setup...even for non-campersAreas of Improvement:- Floor fabric could be thicker, perception of frailty causes suspicion of whether or not you would want to place chairs inside- Pole pockets are made out of mesh rather than some competitive products that have fully enclosed pole sleeves. This increases the difficulty of setup and in my estimation will be the first area of the tent where we will see wear & tear. The mesh easily catches on the flex points of the poles when trying to slide in, especially on the long side to side uni-pole."
4,Shade Tent,"We bought this tent to use at an outdoor concert series. I have a little one who is still nursing and we thought it would give us shade for him, as well as a place to nurse. It worked well! It was easy to set up and take down. We had to move it once and it was easy to move. I did not give it 5 stars because it was difficult to secure. There were some strong storms while we were there and we thought staking the tent with the stakes included would keep it grounded. It did not however. The tent blew over. The stakes were bent in half. Overall though it was a great tent and served exactly as we wanted it to."
3,"Great Beach Shade, Complicted Setup!","I bought this beach shade to...of course...use on the beach. I have an 8 month old and he needed shade. I thought this looked super cool...and it was...after fighting with it in the 90 degree heat on a sandy beach as the baby screamed and cried. It took 15+ minutes to set up which doesn't seem like a long time but trust me when I say it was an eternity under the circumstances. So...15min to put up woudn't really prevent me from using it again because it was pretty near perfect once assembled.The teardown on the other hand was a trainwreck. Sure, it came down in like 5 minutes but the bag it comes in is much too small for the shade to EVER fit back into! The poles alone take up about half the space and unless you have serious origami skills, infinite patience, no wind, no sand, no water, no crying infant, you have no hope. I'm not sure why they'd make a carrying case that's about the size of a handbag, but they sure did.Overall, it's just OK in my book."
3,Good and Bad,"Pros:-lots of sun shelter-great place for my infant to nap in-fun for preschoolers to run around-packs up nicely-not too difficult to set upCons:-sand gets trapped in the poles, makes it hard to ""snap"" into place-sand causes poles to crack-replacement kits are available, but for a price-tends to want to fly in the wind but if you anchor it right and pay attention, it's not a huge dealbottom line is we enjoyed the tent on the beach and didn't find it hard to set up (though it's a bit of a chore) but the poles break too easily considering it was used as directed-- at a beach."
2,The corn isnt ready to be picked!,"Had to buy this for Acting class and it was a below average play and boring as crap to act out!RatingFun Factor- 1 (BORING PLAY AND ACTING IT IS BORING AS WELL!)LOOK - 3 Star (Its a play.....its green... -_-)Durability - 1 Star (binding glue, Fell apart within a week!)"
4,Clearly Canadian (though we're not alike!),"This collection of imagery and musings from Famous Canadian Writer Douglas Coupland didn't always strike a chord with me. I'm from a different part of the country, with different history and experiences, of course.Yet enough was oddly, eerily familiar to convince me that there are few young writers better qualified to comment on the State of Our Nation than Coupland. Not as enjoyable as his fiction, but something fun to tide us fans over while we wait!"
4,My daughter loved it,"Great game and very educational. I gave this game four stars on overall because the age is 6-8 and my daughter just turned 6 but she beat the entire game in about 30 minutes. I was hoping it would be a little more challenging than the 3-5 year old games we have. I do not think it is much more difficult, but she loves it."
3,Needs to be more difficult,"I bought this for my 6 year old neice for Christmas. She seemed to get bored with it quickly. The games were too easy, needed to be more difficult."
3,Husbands Who Won't Lead and Wives Who Won't Follow,"This is a good book which does cover some aspects that helps to gain understanding why men and women are certain ways. I felt it was more heavily leaning towards understanding men and what they need more than understanding women and their needs though. It could have leaned a little more towards helping men to understand women, what women need, why, and how men could step up to the plate. All in all it is a good book helping both spouses understand a biblical marriage and its rewards."
1,Can't be serious,You are not serious. This author has severe mental issues. I've never read such nonsense. A man is not a boss in a marriage....men and women are equals. This book is a very bad message to send to your daughters. This author should be ashamed of himself.
1,Its cheaper than it looks (and yes it looks cheap),"I bought this for an adult cop costume. I don't need movie replica quality but wanted something passable. This would suffice for a child's costume but that's it. While having a silvery metallic quality, it wouldn't be mistaken for real metal in even dim light. The picture featured in the ad isn't very accurate imo.There isn't anything useful to attach it to a costume. $10 ones usually are not only real (albeit cheap) metal but also have a pin that you can use to fasten to the costume. Those I would say are a much better deal. About the only thing this could be used for is to attach to string or a key chain to be worn around the neck. But even then...Yes it's 2 bucks but after paying shipping I would say it's not worth it. I kind of had the feeling this would be the case and wasn't surprised. (So technically it didn't disappoint- but it still sucks)"
1,Buyer Beware - This Drive Won't Last Long,"I have used this drive off and on for the past 6 months or so to archive files off my laptop. It worked fine for a while. I connected it to my laptop, archived about 20 GB of files, then left the laptop and drive up and running while I went to work. When I came back Vista could no longer see the drive. After powering the drive and laptop on and off a few times, Vista would see the drive but saw it as an unformatted drive and wanted me to format it before I could access it. I had a lot of data that I valued highly on that drive - now it seems like it's all lost. Do your homework on the net before considering this drive - I wish I had - you'll be surprised at what people have to say about this ""product""."
1,Nothing but problems,This drive worked for a short time then ceases to be seen by the Windows 2000 operating system. Tried moving drive to another server to reformat with no luck. I basically have a paperweight. Companies tech support is non existent. If you purchase this drive plan on being on your own with no help frmo the company.
1,I hated this book,"I disliked it so much that I deleted it from my Kindle. I apologize to his fans, but for me this was a very big disappointment. I expected poetry and got mediocre dialog abut a drunk who just had sex with any woman that would and than wrote about her flaws and his disillusion.To make matters worse he didn't even do it with humor or rhyme."
5,Broken Hearts are not just for a**holes!,"Bukowski has so many books of poetry that it almost staggers the imagination; if one were to rank them in over-all quality, i would have to say this is in his top five. But with Bukowski that is really leaving out a lot of books; he has over forty just of poetry alone! But getting back to the book at hand, this is definitely one of his best. Written as his early to mid 70's underground cult hero/legend status was firmly rising to a peak, this collection shows him to be as much the sensitive sufferer in the battlegrounds of love as anyone, despite his persistently negative reception among critics as nothing more than a drunken, vulgar boor. AS good an introduction to his work as any."
3,Great Book,"Its a great read but, it showed up looking like a used book. It had a pretty substantial tear/bend on the cover and it was not very well packed. Oh well the content is the same but you'd think they'd take a little bit more care sending books."
3,both good and bad,"I bought this book for two reasons, first the title (both funny and true) and second the content. Giggling in the bookshop I decided this book contained truly inspired works about the trials and tribulations of love and relationships. The content proved true to my first impressions...endless works about Bukowski's endless women. I must admit, however, that halfway through I was bored with the content, the sameness in his descriptions of encounters with the women, the feeling that I was feeling uneasy about his lifestyle and attitude towards women. I will say this is a great book to keep in any Bukowski collection, but is nowhere near his best works. Try other, more inspired works, such as ""Play the Piano Drunk..."" for a better idea of Bukowski's talent and potential."
3,"contents great, materials substandard NOT Black Sparow Press.","The poetry in the book is great. sex, drugs, down and out. my favorite of Buk. Problem is in the book material. This IS NOT the Black Sparrow Press edition. that edition was on heavy paper, clean, crisp. it was a well made book of substance. this book is by Ecco, and is printed on newsprint. its crappy paper, your finger oil might smudge the ink. it feels light, substandard and just plain cheap (which at 12$ it ain't). get the black sparrow edition otherwise just kindle it.5 stars for the poetry1 star for the Ecco edition (avoid!)"
3,A cri d'coeur,"Marvelously illustrated collection of Bukowski's lyrical ballads. A cri d'coeur for the masses. When the poet Chuck and his alter-ego I.M. Barfart blast off to the inter-gallatic center of the Tripdane universe, look out below! Children ages five and under will thrill to the up Chuck's greatest fantasy adventure. Writing from the basement of his Venice beach apartment, Bukowski's prose poetry has never been better off. Teenage poet wannabees and those in search of the lighter things in life should consult the bard's collection of essays ""Notes by a Dirty Old Man"" Don't let the title deceive you. Old up Chuck has plenty to say on the topic of bourgeois bliss and the virtues of working hard. Enjoy yourself!Bring your knife and fork!"
2,Great title and cover - middling book,One of Bukowski's lesser collections of poetry. It's got some good moments (as most of his poetry books tend to) but much of it feels like filler.
3,Toy is okay,My son purchased this aircraft carrier with the hopes that it would come with the 2 helicopters pictured on the website. When it didn't he wasn't really happy with his purchase. It was deceiving to show those when it came with all jets and they are only about an inch long. I don't think I would purchase this toy as a gift. It's not all it's cracked up to be.
4,Beautiful Clock,"I bought this for my mother, who absolutely loves it. It has withstood all sorts of weather, from thunderstorms, high winds, and blizzard conditions."
1,Not made well,"Product brags about being ""precision made in China."" My sample lost a half-hour for every hour. I thought they used a 60 minute hour in China too. It cost half the purchase price to return for a refund."
1,Save Your Money,"Great You Tube Video, too bad the product does not work as advertised. The drilled hole was not centered. I had to go to plan B (the equally worthless EZ Out). That broke off in the hole. Now I have a real problem. I'm worse off than when I started and $40 poorer. Save your money and look elsewhere for a broken stud remover."
4,Super Reader,"Count Von Bek this time, and we are closing on the twentieth century, timewise. The Count has come to the famous brothel, and brought along his very young girlfriend. They are out to have some fun, and plenty of s*x, too, of course. Or a combination.Amidst all the shagging, war and the outside world intervene."
3,FIF without the trumpets,"This CD is O.K. Average. After FIF was over, i guess Reese could make another band to make us smile. well i was in between a smile and a frown on this one. More of a blank stare. This CD has some good songs and some songs that are just not good.Highlights:-You're With Stupid-Amplify-Vendetta-Red Eye To Miami-1985-You're Still The One-In Excelsis DeoEven though these songs are highlights, they will never reach the potential of songs like ""every new day.""This Cd Still deserves a listen though. But a warning...you might be dissapointed."
5,Excellent,"Roper's debut album is excellent. Reese Roper is great at writing lyrics. This album is no exception. Some songs are just fun, but others really resonate with meaning. It does have a different sound than FIF or BSS. There is really not a bad song on this album. If you're a fan of FIF or BSS, then you will not be disappointed. If you're not a fan you should be."
5,BEST EVER PRODUCT for getting rid of Poison Ivy rash.,"This is the ONLY product I've found that ELIMINATES poison ivy. If you've just been gardening and discovered (too late!) a patch of poison ivy, use this on all skin you think has been touched by the oils. It will STOP the rash. If you missed a spot, and you start to get a rash, treat again and it'll wipe it out. Previously my reactions to poison ivy has been so bad I've had to get prednisone to control the rash. (very sensitive) But if I use this right after exposure, I have NO RASH at all. HOORAY! You MUST use it before the rash gets big and ugly though. (within the day of exposure is best.)"
3,Easy Reading,"This book came with a VB starter kit I purchased a couple of years ago. When I read it originally I was impressed more by the writing style than by the content. It does introduce VB Programming and that's all the book claims to do. Mr. Perry, I think you are an excellent writer, please put more content in your books."
1,this book is a waste of money,If you wan't a decent book on learning VB then The Beginner's guide to VB by Peter Wright should be your choice. This book is not at all organized and is very superficial.
1,"Buy another VB book, any other VB book.","This book is one of the worst computer books I have ever had the displeasure of reading. It was the text for a programming class and it was disliked by all of the students and the instructor. The biggest problem is that the book is poorly editted. An indication of this is that the publisher has the ENTIRE index available on their web site because the index in the book is so error filled. The book plods through very basic, non-programming material in the first few chapters but skimps on details when you get to the nitty-gritty stuff. If this book was a car, it would be subject to recall"
1,Beware of Euro-Pro products,"Lousy design, and even worse customer service. They required two-way shipping to repair under warranty: $20 for a $30 product. And were totally unreasonable. I will never buy another product from Euro Pro."
5,Many Uses,"A very nice spontaneous purchase - we use it out of the tub to bathe our daughter and even in the tub to bathe her as well (easier on the back). The stool has even come in handy as a step stool, and her bath toys store neatly inside. Highly recommend."
4,great to store tub toys,I recently purchased the tub side seat and would recommend it to others. I like the vented storage for tub toys and it is great to sit on while giving my son a bath. In the future we will use it as a step for hand washing and potty training. My only criticism is that the texture might be too smooth. It might be slippery for little stocking feet if used as a step.
5,No more messy bathroom,This is great for storing all (or most) of the small bath toys out of sight. Great if your bathroom is shared by the little ones.
5,Great seat and step stool,This product is great. I have had back problems in the past and bathing my babies would be painful at times. This has eliminated any back issues caused by bathing the kids. My 20 month old now uses it as a step stool to wash her hands. The only drawback is that it can take up a lot of floor space in a small bathroom. I would definitely buy again.
1,Not a good step stool!!,"I bought this for my 2 yr old to use to wash her hands and brush her teeth. The top comes off too easily when she moves it. It also doesn't have nonskid feet, so it slides easily. She has almost hurt herself seriously a couple of times before we stopped using it. It might be great to sit on, but it needs a redesign with an eye towards safety for child use."
2,Important safety alert,"I use this as a stool in my daughter's bathroom. I do not store items in it. She uses it to get on the potty and to step up to the sink. Please be advised that if your children are as independent as mine is, this item is 2 pieces which means that when they move it the top sometimes comes off and then is loose. Thus when they step on it they will fall and subsequently get hurt (as my daughter has numerous times). I like to use it to sit during bath times but I am in the process of looking for something that is one piece-safety first!."
3,Great for storage and sitting but VERY tippy,"This stool is great for storing bath items and sitting next to the tub at bath time. The stool specifically says not to use it as a stepstool in the higher level, but even on the lower level a 3 year old stepping on the side can make it flip over. The feet are also just plastic for floor protection, not rubber to keep the stool from slipping. I would not recommend it ever be used as a stepstool."
3,Great for storage- NOT for a step stool!,"We bought this for storing all of the bath toys, soap, shampoo, bubble bath, etc- and it also works great as a seat for Mom or Dad to sit by the bathtub while the little one(s) are in the tub- but I would NOT recommend using it for a step stool for children of any age. Our 3 year old uses it to brush his teeth/wash his hands and the lid tips and comes off if you put too much weight on one side and as a result, when the lid pops off, our son falls off. It's not safe at all for use as a step stool unless you assist them on and off and stay right there to catch them if the top decides to tip off and dump your child."
5,Our favorite stool for multipurposes,"Out of the 2 seat/stools we've tried, we definitely like this one better. At first, we used it as a seat while bathing my young son. Much easier than kneeling or sitting on the edge of the tub. Now that my son is climbing onto everything, we place this against the couch or bed so he can climb up himself instead of needing us to pick him up onto the couch/bed."
2,Not a solid stepstool,"I purchased this step stool along with the ""Munchkin folding stepstool"". I thought this one would be good because of the adjustable height. The stool arrives set at the lowest setting, and to make it higher, you rotate the top 180 degrees. An intersting design! However be warned... the top is somewhat rounded, and if your child steps near the edges the stool will topple and they may fall. This is worse on the HIGHER height.In comparing the two types of stools, the munchkin folding step stool seems much studier (has not tipped yet). Though I am dissapointed in the height of that one.If you are purchasing this simply as a BATH SEAT then it might serve your purpose well.. but as a step stool, there are better options out there... that you can ALSO sit on by the bath!Hope this helps!"
4,Not for use as a stepstool. Good for sitting on.,"It is very unsteady as a stepstool when put on the highest setting.Its great for sitting on it. we use it by the tub to sit and play with our son while he's in the tub. It is steady enough when on its lowest setting, but if you raise the height is DANGEROUS to use as a stepstool as the top is NOT secure when on the higher setting.For what we need it to do, it works well for us. The seat base is wide so sitting is pretty comfortable for us. You can store things in the seat base, but we don't bother to do so. It is easy to raise to a higher setting, just take the top off and turn it around to sit a bit higher."
3,AMAZON'S REVIEW IS WRONG! NOT SUPER HERO HIGH!!!!,"This tape is all animation of the DC Superheroes Captain Marvel, Cap. Marvel Jr. and Mary Marvel and has absolutely NO footage of the old ""Super Hero High"" live-action series from the 70's. Amazon's review of this item is wrong; NONE of the actors mentioned appear on this short (25 minutes) tape. The animation is great and the plot is actually good (rare for Filmation's attempts with DC heroes), so if you are a fan of Shazam (Captain Marvel) then buy a copy. However, please notice that this tape is recorded in SLP mode and the playback may not be very good on your VCR. If you are not a fan of the Big Red Cheese, save your money."
4,Good Learning Tool,"""Introductory Chemistry"" by Cracolice and Peters is very well written, and well organized as far as textbooks go.I always found their ability to explain the basic concepts of Chemistry to be superior to many of the other General Chem books on the market. I used this book in conjunction with ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Chemistry"" by Ian Guch to self-teach myself almost all of the General Chem curriculum. Admittedly, I used Cracolice's work as a supplement to the Complete Idiot's Guide because Guch's book is heads above just about any textbook I have ever encountered in terms of an ability to present the ""nned to know"" info in an accessible framework. I only used Cracolice when I didn't feel satisfied with Guch, and was never really dissapointed. Recommended."
5,simba cable control fire truck,"purchased this fire truck for my grandson for christmas,it was one of the best gifts ever . It turned out to be more than I expected would not recomend for any child under the age of 6. he has used it everyday since then for hours . construction of this toy is sturdy and very realist and loads of fun."
4,"Worth reading, even if you think you already understand","Long established as a classic, the drawing depicting the different classes of customers and their adoption rates are commonly used in the industry. I personally thought I already understood it, just from osmosis. However, reading the book taught me more about the characteristics of those customers, how you gain penetration into their markets, and most importantly how you manage a team and produce a product into those markets.There are also lessons in there about establishing a beachhead and how to choose your target customer that dovetail nicely into some more modern work around persona identification in software development and the need to identify just one target persona for your application at a time. This is a great marketing book -- even if some of the specific company examples are somewhat dated -- whose concepts readily translate into not only management but directly into product development and vision."
4,Crossing the Chasm,"You can tell that Geoffrey Moore had been overturned by the events of the 90s in that business communication just got a million times quicker. He has updated his contents but they are still lean towards that decade. None-the less they are timeless.His content is beyond description it is so fantastic - informative and educational. I'm not recommending this book to any of my friends as I want to keep the sharp edge and knowledge to myself - sorry Geoff.I have put my thinking and business in the fast lane after applying the ideas, which by the way, come with an little analogy that is so simple to follow (read the book to discover his trick) it is a must for every person who has a desire to be head and shoulders above the rest and win.It beats marketing in the formal sense and offers down to earth ideas that really work. Thanks Geoffrey.Mike WhitenburghPsychoanalyst."
4,Chasing the Chasm Review,"I enjoyed reading The book ""Chasing the Chasm"" by Geoffrey A. Moore. It focused on the adaption of technical products and how to market high technical products during the start up period. He explains the chasm between the early adopters of the product and the early majority. He explore the differences between visionaries and pragmatists and suggest techniques to cross the chasm by choosing market target, understanding the concept of the product, positioning the product, forming a marketing strategy and selecting the best distribution method and price."
4,Great book for anyone selling anything,"Lots of the ideas in this book help explain various companies issues with brining products to a market place. The distribution of customers is a constantly retold story in board rooms across the world and in every different market segment outlined by Moore. Sometimes its difficult to read, but the real meat of this is priceless. Recommended."
3,Great for marketing people.,The idea is solid that there is a chasm in the development of a market but this is a macro view of how things work and if you are a CEO you can do something about it. I'm a salesperson so I have to sell around these issues. So this is a book for business strategy not sales execution.
4,A little dated but still very relivent.,The book explains the buying patterns of early stage products and what happens as the market matures. Real world case studies but from the early 90's.
3,Business case studies,"Message -- work hard and come up with an ""out of the box"" concept and you'll probably be very successful."
4,Some pretty smart ideas,"Thougth this book had some interesing ideas, well worth a read if you're in marketing or R & D. Helps you to think about some of the things that impact your product."
4,"Great book, but outdated. Needs new, updated case studies.","Great book, but outdated. Needs new, updated case studies. The book has excellent review of how to go about segmented markets and how to find general marketing direction for one's own company. I find this book to be extremely useful, but outdated. I think new, updated edition has to be published, otherwise the book is history. Give us some new case studies and the same theories could be applied to new and emerging companies/markets."
3,A little bit of a let down,"I am normally a big fan of the black lace anthologies. This latest in the Wicked Words series was a bit of a dissapointment. While the content was ok, most of the stories did not have the usual edge that the earlier antholgies have been known for. It is worth a read (as they all are), there are a few good stories in the collection."
5,Hot Hot Hot,"Another fun, hot collection of Wicked Words. My personal faves were Playtime, The Jewel and Cavern in the Green.Well done Black Lace. Keem em ...coming."
4,Love it!,"I'm very happy with this frame. It's even nicer than it appears in the photo. There is a sepia-colored tint underneath the raised floral design, which gives it nice definition. The frame comes with a thick length of wire for hanging, and the four brackets on the back allow for either vertical or horizontal hanging. My frame has a small flaw along the inside beaded edge--a 1"" long smooth section that should be beaded. It isn't very noticeable, but for this reason I gave the frame a rating of 4 stars rather than 5 stars."
3,"6x8 Picture/Photo Frame, Silver with Floral Design",Not as pretty as it appears online. Not worth paying the shipping - go to a store.
1,Don't Order. Poorly packaged and Broken,"When I received this frame it was broken! So I did a return and asked for a replacement. In my return I stated that is was broken because it was improperly packaged. Yet, I get the second frame and it is too broken, the glass is shattered. It would be a beautiful frame if I could get one not broken!"
2,"Received 2, both broken","For Mothers Day my sister and I made a really nice collage of the grand kids for our mom. I loved how this frame looked so I ordered it. I received it and the glass was broken so I returned it and waited for the next one to come in. I received the next one and it was broken as well. I gave up after that and just requested a refund and went out and bought one myself but could not find one I liked as much as this one. As for how it looks and all, I would give this product 5 stars, but because I was unable to use either that was sent to me I gave only 2. I think that whoever is doing the shipping needs to pack the boxes better to prevent this in the future."
3,Broken,"I can't be too specific about how I liked a fully intact frame, because I never got one. I ordered one, and it came with the glass broken. The replacement one also had the glass broken. Amazon was really great about taking each back. The supplier is not doing a great job of packing it, and now I'll be ordering something else instead."
3,Stuck on #18 in the CD,I love the CD; only wish the #18 track did not stick indefinitely. I have to switch it manually every time I listen to it!
4,Great sounds from the Best,"This CD brought back lots of good memories. Roy Orbison was one of the Greats, Saw him in person years ago and will never forget the great voice he had. I recommend buying this CD"
4,Sound is good,"I would like to suggest, contrary to the review of Aug 2006, that the sound on this nice collection of Roy Orbison's Monument hits, is actually quite good.With the puzzling exception of the song LOVE HURTS, which seems to have been mastered from a very muffled tape.This Sony disk was issued in 1989, and has not been re-mastered since then, so you're getting a relatively unfutzed edition for a nominal price."
5,One of the most outstanding albums ever.,"This album is an utter runaway train. It's often a harrowing experience. It's also often rockin' good times. It's suspenseful, always keeping one on their toes. In short, it's a great album. Only Roy Orbison could make an album where utter pathos and rough and ready rock n'roll, complete with gargling growls at pretty women, could co-exist and not sound ridiculous. Orbison was a wonder. The album is pure joy."
5,the god-father of Goth,"This man is the original gloom-rocker. He turns his sorrow into sweeping, operatic anthems which are beautiful and heart-breaking. Morrissey's got nothing on this guy."
3,Organic Vanilla Extract,"Okay so for the price, this is to be expected, after all, it's organic. I was in a pinch for vanilla extract (REAL Vanilla Extract) and I bought here on Amazon. I know for the same price, this cost just as much at my local Whole Foods, but I bought here and was quite pleased with the product. It's a real high quality extract and using it in my baked goods and some other dishes, I could tell the difference in taste. I use a lot of vanilla extract so for me the only real downside is/was they don't make it bigger. Perhaps I will have to buy this in bulk."
4,Sweet memories are made of these...,"Britt Lomond gives us a lovely glimpse into the world of the Zorro phenomenon as it played out via Disney's magic in the late 1950's and early 60's. He treats us to a behind the scenes look at how the duels between Monastario and Zorro were choreographed... and how he still bears the Mark of Zorro to this very day from the sword tip of Guy Williams. Also revealed, perhaps inadvertently, is the wonderful nature of this man... who with gentlemanly grace accepted the role of Monastario rather than the coveted role of El Zorro... all for the good of the show and not his own ego. A recommended read..."
3,A fair read at best,"The premise is extremely interesting and it makes the first portion of the book fascinating as the mystery unfolds. It is also doomed by its own premise, as the execution becomes a bit tedious and redundant as the Sentry must be introduced into the life of one hero after another as the ultimate hero and the Void is similarly introduced as the vilest villain known. Because we have limited experience with both, and are ""told"" as much as we are ""shown"", accordingly the connection is not made and it becomes no more than a fair story at best."
3,Good idea marred by bad execution,"I like Jenkins work in general, and the art here is fine. My concern lies primarily with the pacing of the tale: it's flat-out too slow, repeats itself for next-to-no reason WAY too often (even for a book that's split across a few titles it's too repetitous) and its flat-out anti-climatic. The intriguing idea of a long-lost hero's return - beloved (albeit unbelievably so for my taste...smacks too much of ""Astro City"", and not pleasantly so), powerful and righteous - into current day continuity was cool. It ends up, unfortunately, coming off like a boring Miracleman book."
1,A waste of time,"This is a dull comic. Nothwitstanding the rather nice drawings, the sheer stupidity and pointless plot of a comic book hero as either /neither a hoax or a parody is tiresome. The all-powerful demi-god Sentry with a drink problem and permanent hallucinations is not helped by the very ugly costume design. Unless the reader is a fanatical comics fan, there are too many in-house jokes about the writer and his creation, a comic book within a comic book etc to interest the casual comics reader to make this a worthwhile read."
5,"Excellent book, wish they had an updated version","This book is excellent for both the beginner and the experienced tech in the IT field or just for someone who wants to learn to troubleshoot their own issues on their Windows system.If you look at the published date it is 2003, so the one thing that I would like to see is an updated version of this book for the current operating system and applications."
5,"Great product, beautifully packaged and an awesome treat","I knew the Achva brand before purchasing this product from Amazon so I had a real easy time deciding to purchase it. This 5-pack contains 5 boxes, each containing several individually packed Halva pieces (don't remember how many but I think they were about 8-10 per package, but I'm not sure). The product itself is of good quality, even compared to the 'real thing' sold on street carts in Turkey and other places. I highly recommend either as a relatively healthy sweet snack or as a gift. Enjoy."
2,Great idea but not so well done.,"This series features Professor Greenburg's exploration into the world of opera. It would be a great idea, if it weren't for the fact that most of it consists of Professor Greenburg's conjecture. He dwells on Primitive music for far too long than is relevant for Opera. And he is quite the opinionated Professor with his ideas such as ""the composer as dramatist"" not the performer. And so forth. Every so often, he gets into the history and facts that make Opera interesting. But for far too much of time, he simply conjectures and I found myself disagreeing with most of his conjectures. Even though, I'm an admirer of Opera."
4,"Great Booster Seat, I'd use it again!","As a grandmother who babysits everyweek day,this seat has been great for me. I love the fact that the seat grows with the child. It is easy to clean and very adaptable. I haven't had any problems with this seat. The price is right also. I will be babysitting for a second grandchild soon, and when she(or he) is of the age for a booster seat, I'll be using it again."
3,good chair,"Admittedly the tray does come off too easily and the sides are a little low for my taste. It is a very good chair, though. Being on our fifth child we have tried so many different routes and I have found that if the straps on most boosters aren't tight enough, it's your chair, not the booster. We've had the basic high chair and I still have the peg-perego (sitting in my garage) only a couple of years old. I will not go back to a high chair again. They take up so much space. I love the fact that the tray swings open, if only it didn't pop off whenever the child smacks it. Then everything on it goes flying. My 16, mo. old does love her seat, though."
2,A Disappointment,"I bought this booster for my 2 year old daughter and returned it the very next day. First thing I noticed, is that the straps don't tighten well around the chair, making for a loose fit. Then, the strap that goes around the child's waist doesn't securely hook onto the seat and my daughter was able to wiggle it out of it's slot in less than a minute. When I took her out, I noticed that one side of the seat had come out of it's slot. I hate to say I bought it mainly for the price and I've always respected this brand, but this is just not a good product for toddlers."
2,Falls apart easily,"I bought this for my 2 year old who wants to sit at the big boy table. It lasted 2 weeks of him taking the back off and sliding the seat part half off. I did not use the tray so the hole to hold the tray was left open. Needless to say that is where he stashed crumbs. I really like the design and the ease of the straps, but it falls apart to easiely. I think I am going to buy the Fold & Go Booster from Safety First."
3,be forewarned,This was a great booster until we decided to remove the tray and pull my son's chair closer to the table. Once the tray is removed there is a hole from the peg for the swing tray. My son loved to shove bits of food down the hole. Since we have wide chairs the food collected under there and I discovered 2 day old peas under his seat. I hated having to completely unhook the booster after every meal. I tried putting a piece of gaffers tape underneath the hole but my son found it intriguing and exciting to try to break through the tape.We bought a new booster.
2,Not the best choice,"My 18 month old was able to unlatch the table and swing it. On one occasion she managed to pull it fully off. Also, since the height is not at all adjustable, she could not sit at the table.We returned it and found a better alternative."
1,Almost caused dangerous fall,I purchaed this booster for my son and the day after I purchased it he was able to remove the tray. He also tried to climb up in it and the back collapsed almost causing him to hit his head on our dining room table. I do not recommend this booster because I feel that it is not very sturdy and a child should not be strong enough to fold over the back by pulling on it to get into the seat.
1,it stinks,"I bought this seat for my son to replace a safety first chair that I accidently left at Grandma's. It looked similiar on the box and I love the Safety First Booster. This one was awful. First of all the plastic is flimsy. It does snap together easily enough but it comes apart easy too. My son took it apart several times. The seat base also fell out of it while he was sitting in it. I had already cut the UPC code off the box to send in with a rebate and luckily had not mailed it yet so I took the whole thing back to Target. When asked if anything was wrong I told the saleperson about my son falling and got a ""huh"". So much for quality merchandise."
2,It lasted a year,It lasted a year and it goes in the dishwasher and that is all the good there is to say about it. Now the bad! The pivot point where the back attaches to the chair is poorly engineered and comes off way to easy. Mine is warn to the point that my 20 month old can pull it off when he is sitting in it. First he takes the tray off (also very easy for him) and then he pulls the back off. At that point he shimmies out of the straps and is out of the whole thing. Don't plan on it lasting through more than one child.
1,Take it back!,"I recently purchased this seat for my son because he is ""too big"" for the high chair and I wanted something that would keep him from falling out of the dining chairs! So we went and got him this big boy chair and he was so excited to sit in it - after the 45 mins of getting it all together right - he sat in it and it pretty much fell apart. The straps get tangled up and hurt his legs and the latch is pretty hard to unbuckle. I am taking this back to get a different seat."
4,love it,"I have had this seat for 5 years. I love it I use it every day for my daughters and for my daycare children. I love that it can go in the dishwasher at the end of the day to be sterilized, and I love how the kids can't escape from it like they can from my highchair. I plan on buying more of these chairs."
3,Not for long term use.,"I bought this tray seat for a weeks use at my fathers house in SC. Im glad it was only a week. It tips very easily even with the safety straps firmly in place. and my 20 month old son can easily remove the tray when hes seated in it. BUT, it served its purpose I suppose."
5,the best seat ever,"My husband and I love this seat. We have two, one is for the and one is for home. The one in the car is for travel and when we go out to eat. It is so convieniant since most high chairs in restaurants are way to big for a 10 month old. It folds up and sits in the trunk without taking up too much space. Also the chair in the house is connected to a table chair and out of the way it never takes up any needed space. The chair seat raises and lowers that ajusts to his growth and comes apart very easily and fits well in the dish washer for quick washing and it is sterilized whice is the most important factor. I recamend this chair to everyone in the market for a high chair."
1,Do Not Buy This Chair!,"I bought two of these chairs for my infant twins. They quickly learned how to kick off the tray with their feet, sending food flying everywhere! I notified the company of this problem and they sent replacement trays, which the babies were also able to easily kick off. A few weeks later, they learned how to pull off the back of the seat and toss that to the ground too. I decided enough was enough and bought the First Years chairs instead."
2,Not a stable chair,"This chair is very unstable and wobbley. I returned it and bought another one by ""the first years"" that is much more stable and reclines for infant feeding."
2,Great Concept,"This seat is a great concept, it just doesn't stay together very well. I took it back to the store and they marked it as ""defective"". For a few dollars more, I got the ""Healthy Care Booster Seat"" from Fisher Price. I've had much better luck with it."
1,"I loved the concept, but hate the seat!","I was excited to see that this booster could easily be cleaned in the dishwasher, but my 34lb son keeps falling out. The seat bottom detaches while he is sitting in it. It is horrible. It may be easier to clean, but I will go back to my other seat that has worked well for us for the last year and a half(Reclining 4-Stage seat by The First Years)."
1,Terrible Design,"We had been researching booster seats for our 2 year old and we found this seat and thought it was an large enough and sturdy enough for our rambunctious son. Boy, were we wrong. The first time we put our son in it the seat fell apart. So we popped it back into place and all he has to do is wiggle a bit and the seat pops out again. He only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50....I would definitely not recommend this to anyone."
2,OK for smaller children maybe,"We bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents. However, he is a very large boy (35"" and 34 lbs) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably. So we took off the tray so he could sit at the table, and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food. We went back to the high chair without the tray - and he is perfectly happy. We use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable, but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food."
1,too many flaws,"The straps for securing a child were worthless, they kept popping out the back. My daughter couldn't use this chair until she was 9 months old and now I have to quickly grab her when I swivel the tray open before she throws herself out. The tray isn't very secure, it wants to pop out of the swivel side too easily. And, (...), the whole left from where the tray pops into to swivel, is just a nice little place for a toddler to stash food. I am planning on buying a different one soon."
2,Not safe,We bought this chair to use as a spare for company and to use when we travel. NUMEROUS times it has fallen apart while carrying it. When my 1 year old sits in the chair she is able pull the tray right off. Thank goodness for the straps!! We used it in the park one day and she leaned back hard enough that the back popped off. (usually it has a chair to use as a back support) We only use this chair when we have too. Otherwise we use the tot lock by graco. Much more sturdy.
2,Big Disappointment,"I previously owned a Breadman vertical bread machine. It baked excellent bread in the one pound mode, wish that I could say the same for this machine. The bread does not rise very high and seems to collapse after reaching its highest point. Wish that my other machine's bread pan did not leak, it baked excellent bread which rose very high and the flavor was much better."
2,"Too noisy,","Pluses, price was very good and the quality of bread is good. Negatives - This is my 4th bread machine and definitely less well made that the previous ones. It is very noisy as many reviewers had pointed out. I thought because it is used in a laundry room with a door that can be closed, I wouldn't notice the noise, not so! Also, the pan is much lighter weight than others I've owned and does not snap in and out easily. Controls are hard to read, as other reviewers complained about. If money is not a big issue for you, go ahead and get a higher rated, better quality machine. The last machine we had was a Breadman, more than ten years old when it wore out, and I expected better quality."
2,Not what I wanted,"Bought a TR520 at K-mart just before Christmas, present to myself! Have not been satisfied with the quality of the bread.Followed the recipes exactly and none of the loaves I've tried have been as good as they should be. My first one, a plain white on light setting , delayed setting,was a real flop. The second one, Cranberry-walnut recipe did better ( didn't do the delayed time)but it didn't have a ""kneaded"" type texture. Next was onion bread but I used a dried vegetable mix instead, again very coarse texture. I've used proper yeast and bread flour.Also the smaller loaf came out as wide as the full 2# loaf, which was not what I expected.There should probably be an insert to use with the lesser amount of flour to get a proper size loaf. I'm seriously considering taking it back ( if K-mart will let me) I'll keep looking and reading reviews before another purchase. Was so looking forward to having 'home-made fresh bread'"
3,"If It Weren't Defective, It Would Have Been Great.","I received my Breadman & was eager to bake my 1st loaf. So I carefully measured all ingredients and pushed START. It worked great through the mixing, kneading & raising processes. However, my machine had a defective heating element. I ended up baking the loaf in my oven. It was very tasty - light, even textured - the perfect loaf. I think I would have rated this machine '5 stars' if the baking cycle had worked. I sent the machine back to Amazon. They were terrific! Easy returns, very helpful - no hassles."
1,$7.50 fee for DOA machine,"I chose this machine because it was inexpensive but had generally very good reviews. When it arrived, I ran the fast-bake cycle as the manual instructs, to burn off the manufacturing oils. At that point, the machine broke. I could hear something rattling around inside and a screw and couple little round things fell out. I contacted the company, per the manual, and customer service agreed it was under warranty and they'd replace it BUT they are charging me $7.50 for shipping and handling the new machine, and I have to pay several dollars more to mail them the power cord and documentation of the purchase. Since price was a big reason I bought this particular machine, I'm none too pleased to be paying an extra $10 to replace a machine that never produced a single loaf of bread."
1,poor product,I purcahsed this breadmaker after my last one wore out. I purchased in Jan 2011. The motor gave out in Sept 2011. That's a very poor engineering. It was used at most 2 times a month.
4,Good Bread,"I had never baked bread before, and this is the first bread maker I've ever had. The first time using it was a success. The instructions could be better written, which is why I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars, but other than that I am very happy with the bread maker."
5,My first bread maker,"My sister had this bread maker when I went to visit. I've never owned one but she was making the most delicious things every day so I was convinced.Pros-Instructions are very clear and easy to understandViewing window is great so I won't open when it isn't necessaryThe beep is loud enough to hear anywhere in my houseEvery feature needed to make all the breads I would want to makeProgramming and auto warm so I can set it and come back when I'm ready to use my breadConsThe screen is a little smallThe white letters on a yellow background make them difficult to seeI am on my 3rd loaf, I have tried the basic, sweet and quick programs so far on 1 and 2 lb loaf sizes and I've tried the dough feature once. Everything I have made was a recipe from the book it came with and they were all delicious. The white bread is my new sandwich staple! Great product"
3,breadmaker,this machine is ok. it is very basic. i think that i should have spent more and got a better one. but this one does the job.
4,display panel should be improved,"The display color choices are almost impossible to read...That yellow color and white lettering is not good and should be changed. I rewrote the loaf size and crust color in thin magic marker. Other than that, I like the machine and use it often."
5,Great Product,This breadmaker is a great machine. It allows you to make different sizes of loaves to suit your needs. I would recommend anyone to purchase it.
3,"Good bread, but not real flexible","This will make good bread, but only allows using the pre-programmed options and I wouldn't recommend using recipes that do not require resting to allow for the dough to rise. No custom baking modes, need to use a regular oven for that."
1,Good while it lasted,"Received this breadmaker in Sept 07 and must admit I used it at least once a week, it's now May 08 and the last 4 loaves have flopped. The recipe is the same, then I thought it might be the yeast, so I purchased a new bottle. The last loaf still did not rise and bake properly. I'm using just the dough cycle until I buy a new machine. I will pay a little more and hopefully it will last a little longer."
1,Who designed the color scheme for the control panel?????,"Why would anyone put this color combination on an appliance?? You can not read any of the controls. Light yellow with white lettering, what were they thinking?? Anyhow opened the box took out the machine. Went to try and use it and the kneading paddle did not fit flat in the baking pan. It sat about 1/4"" too high. During the kneading cycle the paddle surely would have wound up in the dough ball. Well back to the store with this one!"
3,Breadman TR520,"Can't read writing on yellow background. What idiot designed this?Other than that, I like it. Breads are very good and easy to make. This is my fourth Breadman!"
3,control panel blues,"First loaf was the 'fast bake' and was okay. Next loaf, the 1.5 loaf french bread was pretty good. The honey wheat was 2 lb and went over the top of the pan and crust was hard as a rock. The problem is the difficulty reading the control panel, even with a flashlight. The white on yellow background was a poor choice for us 'senior citizens'. It was worth the price."
5,Love it,"My wife had gone through a bunch of bread makers, wearing them all out. I waited to review to see how it woeked. Glad to say she is still working like new and my wife is still happy."
3,Satisfactory for the money,"We have two of these as well as two older Breadmans and a Sunbeam. I make bread for us and another family on an average of four loaves or more per week. I use my own recipe - a type of oatmeal/honey bread - on cycle 1L.Pros:Makes a well shaped loaf with a nice top or dome. I have had no problems with falling after rising.The bread has a nice moist texture with a light crust (see cons).Cons:Labeling hard to read. Letters should be a dark color.We all like a light brown crust that isn't tough. In order to get this even on the light setting, I have to stop the baking cycle 15 to 20 minutes before it is finished. This requires that I monitor the time thus destroying the automatic feature. If I finish the cycle, the crust is dark and hard. This may not matter to everyone so, if you can but it for $60.00 or less, I'd recommend it.I'm still looking for a machine that has an adjustable bake cycle."
4,Breadman 2-lb Horizontal Breadmaker - TR520,"For the Price - and excellent buy!!When I got it home the first thing I made was Cranberry Quick Bread. It was really great tasting, no added bowls-everything was just put in the baking container, turned it on and done.I use to make bread from scratch and this machine has taken the work out of making bread. Plus now, you can have bread in a little over an hour.Great Buy if you like no work and homemade bread!!!"
2,Programming will not work,"Wanted to be able to make any of the three sized loaves, looked forward to getting this breadmaker. Wanted to replace my old breadmaker. Even though it arrived quickly, woe unto me, the programming functions would not work. I pressed the ""program"" button and a ""6"" appeared in the window, then the time which I could not set.Also, I didn't notice until I opened the package and looked at the panel itself, the yellow background and white lettering are exceedingly hard to read, especially for an old-timer.I'm sorry to have to return this product. I will try another brand."
1,White on Yellow,"Took the machine Breadman Model TR520 out of the box. Set it up. Started to use it according to the instructions. Hmmmmmm, where's the printed information for the buttons...it's supposed to be on the machine...huh?...oh! There it is. It's the white letters and words printed on a light yellow background. Wow! That is hard to read. Lessee...if I plan on using this for the next five years how am I going to feel squinting and moving the machine around so I can get it just so in the light so I can read. I DON'T THINK SO!"
4,very pleased!,This is my first bread machine and I am 78 years old. Since I have nothing to compare this machine machine to any other I can only say I am pleased. The price was great. I have made 4 loaves and each was perfect. It did not walk across the counter and I found it very quiet.
3,Breadman defective,"First time use showed that the viewing window was not secured. It slipped enough to allow the heat to escape during baking, making a loaf that did notbrown on the top.However, the Breadman was immediately replaced with one that works well, though the ""Fast Bake""(one-hour)program doesn't brown the top crust well. Recommend use of the longer baking periods."
4,Simple to use,I am on my fifth loaf of bread in less than two weeks. I would rate it five stars except for the white text on yellow background issue others have mentioned. Still it is simple enough to allow someone to memorize the controls. Making 1lb loafs is possible but I recommend keeping an eye on it to ensure proper mixing and kneading. And I recommend using bread machine recipes from online (I am currently using ones from King Arthur Flour but there are many sites to choose from).
2,Buy a Different One,I have had this bread machine for one year. At first I was very excited to start using it. I have used it a lot. Every loaf of bread I have made has been over cooked. The paddle is also difficult to remove to clean the machine. I am now looking for a better machine. It may be an inexpensive machine but it is a waste of money. Spend a little more money and buy a much better machine.
4,Breadman TR520 satisfaction,"This is my second Breadman machine, Better, smaller, but top panel white letters on yellow not easy to read.Joseph PaulicMaywood, New Jersey"
4,works well,Works as advertised. Takes a few bread making sessions to understand some of the details. The control panel color (yellow on white) is hard to see as another reviewer mentioned. So far like it very much
5,bread maker,The Breadman TR520 bread maker is the best one I have had and it really does all you can expect from a bread maker I have had 3 bread makers so far and this bread maker is 3+ years old is used about once a week and going strong...if you are going to buy a bread maker I feel yoy cannot do any better then this and the price is right also...it is areal value...
5,Just what I wanted,"This is my second bread machine. I had one like this, different brand, and totally worked it to death. When I had to replace it I got this one, and am more than happy. It looks like the one I had, but seems to be a better quality. Works wonderful and who could argue with the price?"
1,Breadman TRS 520,"On my first use, I used the #7 program, for dough as my receipt called for. Then went to #8 program for bake, could not set the, time the defalt was 10 minutes. The cook time needed was one hour +. Had to reset and start program over for 6 times."
3,Bread Baker,"I use this machine merely to prepare bread dough in preparation for baking in a conventional oven and bread pan. It does a good job mixing the ingredients and raising the dough. Therefore, can not comment on its performance as a baking machine."
1,Misleading Listing,"This Melitta doesn't get any positive reviews, because out of two orders, I never received the Melitta. Only a Breadman bread machine that sells for $18.00 less than what I paid for the Melitta on Amazon. Not to mention, I paid full price for a new Melitta and was sent a USED Breadman machine. After the hassle of returning it and asking Amazon to send me a new Melitta like I originally ordered, I was sent a Breadman again! I returned this machine as well and am still waiting on my full refund."
1,Breadmaker,I bought this item used and the previous owner didn't even bother to wash it. I will never buy any used items anywhere again!
5,Breadman Bread Maker,"It has all the functions I need. I made good breads out of it. Very useful and the price is good. It is best to put it on the floor because the maker will move a little bit during the kneading process. Overall, this is a real helpful in the kitchen."
3,Breadmaker,My problem with this product is the bread does not completely bake. I have tried everything and finally just put it in the oven an extra 13 minutes to finish it.
1,Broke on the 3rd loaf,Machine doesn't turn on after 2 loaves of bread baked. Amazon will only accept it back for a partial refund. Should have paid an extra $50 and got a real breadmaker. What a waste of time and money.AVOID THIS MACHINE.
4,Not bad considering I can't make bread to save my life...,"Yes, this machine does make bread pretty well. The loaves are heavy but that might be my fault because they are also dense. Practice makes perfect. The timer bells sound wierd but I'm used to them now. The kneading cycles go clack-clack-clack-clack! Disconcerting at first. Now I think it's hilarious. The kneading blade gets cooked into the loaf so that it has to be cut out after baking is done, which mars the otherwise smooth underside of the loaf. But I'm used to that also. The directions booklet is fairly easy to understand, has good tips for non-bakers like me, has many good recipes for various breads (including fast bake recipes!) and has directions for baking-powder-based items."
4,Breadman TR520 Breadmaker,Breadmaker is great. White writing on yellow is a problem but I knew that when I bought it. As long as you input the liquids before the flour everything works great.
3,problems,my 1lb loaves are way too brown and I have trouble releasing the bread from the pan. I'm also not sure howto set the loaf size.
2,Motor burned up after 1 year (55 loaves),"I owned an earlier Breadman model that lasted for 320 loaves (1/week) before the paddle connection wore away. I bought this Breadman machine and was thrilled that the new design of the paddle no longer had a very small section of the paddle that could wear out. It didn't bake loaves quite as flawlessly (on the new machine I needed to occasionally help get dough stuck in the corners to mix into the dough ball), but it worked well enough. Until today, just past one 1 year of owning it, the motor burned up."
3,Who designed the colors on this machine?,"I bought this bread machine because it uses the same paddle as my old one, which finally broke after years. So I could use the same paddle, the same recipes, etc. And the bread so far comes out fine.I wanted to say that before complaining about the design. White print on yellow background - you can't even read the choices on the control panel. Except for STOP, which is in red. Initially I resorted to using a flashlight to program the loaf - I finally used a black Sharpie to overwrite all the white printing so I could see it in the future.Like I said, the bread comes out fine. But I would NEVER buy this model again."
4,My problem.,I just unpacked this product and it came without a kneading attachment. I give it a one star for that reason. Unless I get one I will never know if the machine is any good or not.The problem was resolved. I received a new bread machine. I have had success baking my first three loaves.I do have some problem reading the control panel. I have to go to the manual where there is a black and white copy of the control panel which is readable.I have updated from 1 star to 4 stars.
3,"Makes good bread, but control panel labels are poor","My husband chose this machine because of the low price. It's made great bread so far (4 loaves), but the labels on the control panel are ridiculously hard to read - white lettering on a yellowish background. Last week I had to unplug and restart the program because I misread one of the labels."
2,Controls unreadable,"This bread machine makes a very nice loaf of bread, but it is a real trial to use--because the control panel is white print on a bright yellow background--almost completely unreadable except in the brightest light. Not for anyone with presbyopia!"
3,Breadman BreadMachine,"I have not used this machine yet, mainly because I was trying to decide whether I wanted to keep it. It looks good and has the features I wanted. However the printing on the machine is almost impossible to see,making it difficult to use. I guess I will make a drawing of the instructions and hope Ican work from that. White on yellow and small, makes you wonder who designed this."
1,Control panel is unreadable (white on yellow),"This appears to be a well made unit, but it has a basic ergonomic flaw. The yellow control panel has white lettering, except for the word STOP, which is in red. There is not enough contrast to make the labels readable. In my opinion, that makes the panel, and thus the machine, useless. The photos in the Amazon listing show more contrast than the actual panel. I am sending it back as defective."
5,Product is awesome,"I purchased this item as a gift for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. She liked bread with herbs and different spices as well as different types of flour. This fills the bill, she can make any kind of bread she likes. She has the ability to be very gourmet."
4,love it except for the corners,"I love this breadmaker. However, because of the shape - check the corners for flour residue. Just scrape with a spatula in the beginning.It does make great bread with the crust you want."
3,Sing for love. Sing for magic. Sing for always.,"This is another album by the prolific Jandek. It was released in 1986. The instrumentation is Jandek on electric guitar (and occasionally harmonica) and someone else on drums. There may be someone on bass guitar, but the album is mixed so poorly, it's hard to tell. All the instruments are amateurishly played. The girl singer called ""Nancy"" sings on several songs, sometimes solo, sometimes in duet with Jandek. Most people will find this album unlistenable, but I kind of like it."
3,This is not the entire picture,"The person that reviewed this book so far cannot understand, maybe empathize, what the parents of these children endure in a society that is dominated by the notion of ""whiteness"". The only parents talked about, are those immigrants who speak Spanish and are often the target of repeated injustices. As an educator, most parents are like the parents discussed in the book. Of course, the differences like language, culture, and the history of different populations and what those implications entail, are very critical factors to consider. The previous review is a helpful one because it reaffirms what people still believe and continue to do-blaming ""others,"" the victims, for why they and generations after them are still not doing well."
5,"Slavery, Secession, and Southern History","If you are intrested in Slavery, Secession, and Southern History as am, this book is perfect fo you. Edited by the brillant Professor of Economics Louis Ferleger, this book is a collection of articles that discuss diffrent parts of th 19th century south. I think it is a great book every history buff should own, no collection is complete without it."
5,Great Teacher,Prof. Bordo is my instructor for my Financial & Monetary History of the US class here at Rutgers University. He is a brilliant guy and I am sure this book is great. I have never read it but he is no slouch.
4,Great book,"I never bought this book so I could lose some weight. If I want to change anything about my body, I'd like to be way more heavy. Although that's possible, it isn't anywhere near as easy as Ellis claims. Instead, I used his science to fix some of the problems I had with my stomach.The book does an excellent job in explaining why high saturated fat / high protein diets aren't bad and why they are superior to carbohydrate diets. The book really explains the whole process and proved to be an excellent expansion on the work once done by Weston A. Price and his book 'Nutrition and Physical Degeration'.However, the book is way too repetative and besides some references within the text, it doesn't contain any footnotes / endnotes, which is something you would definitely expect from someone who has a Ph.d.Still, I highly recommend the book. The science within it is pretty unique."
