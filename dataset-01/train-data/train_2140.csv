4,Very cool tool! But have a question?,"Just got mine in the other day too and having loads of fun with it, so far. Great and inexpensive motivator, that's for sure. I would give this product 5 stars if I could figure out how to use the memory function.Question for those who've purchased this unit - How do I go about viewing the AEROBIC MINUTES for the PREVIOUS DAYS?"
3,Omron HJ-122 Pedometer review,"I have never owned another pedometer other than this Omron so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it is a very sturdy product and works very well. It is extrememly easy to set up and read. Having said that, my complaints are that unless you attach the secondary string clip (comes with the product) you will lose your pedometer becasue the larger clip holder does not hold the Omron well enough on its own. (My husband lost his the second day he wore his and we had to buy another). The pedometer is also larger and bulkier than I'd prefer and looks like a big lump under all my clothes. And, because it is silver and not black, it also stands out like a sore thumb if you clip it anywhere below a shirt hem-line. Black would have been a much better color."
4,omron pedometer,very accurate and easy to use. resets itself at midnight and stores previous six days worth of data. makes daily and weekly tracking easy
5,This is an Item I trust...,This is one reliable piece of equipment.. It's 100% dependable and accurate.. I TRUST it.. I give it 5 starts.
5,Best Pedometer Ever!!,"This is by far the best pedometer I have ever used. I was looking for one that I could carry in my pocket and it really does work, even in pockets!! I also purchased the book10,000 Steps a Day to Your Optimal Weight: Walk Your Way to Better Health. The book was helpful in getting me motivated to walk more."
4,Amaze yourself!,"This is a very nice product (I bought one for myself and one for my wife). Well finished, easy to read and apparently well engineered. It's easy to set stride length and easy to track steps, aerobic steps, distance and calories burned. We often walk together and there is good consistency of displayed results between the two units. The memory function is a bit strange, but workable. The device seems to work consistently whether attached to a belt or carried in a pocket.Throw one in your pocket and see how many steps you actually take during a normal day - you'll be amazed!"
4,Good Pedometer,"Good pedometer with lots of useful functions. It comes with a holder, which you can clip on your waist band or pocket, and a strap that can be attached to the top. It also fits well in your pocket if you have one. The only con, the holder comes off your waist band some times when you bend or rise from a sitting position. There is a cord that can be attached, but it needs to be longer incase you want to hang it around your neck. I end up clipping the cord to a button loop so the unit will not fall to the ground if the holder comes off."
5,best pedometer that I've ever bought!,"Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometerthis is the best brand of pedometers that I've tried. (and I've used many including Weight Watchers, and various ones bought at Walmart, etc.) Best feature is that is cannot be accidentally reset during the day..automatically goes back to zero at midnight each day. nothing more frustrating that having a couple thousand steps in, only to have one of my previous pedometers accidentally get bumped and reset in the middle of the day. Like the seven day memory as well. I've used another model of Omcron with the ability to link it to my computer but that was more than I needed. I just record my daily steps, and aerobic steps in my Weight Watcher journal daily. love this product and highly recommend it."
3,Great Product Horrible Clip,"I owned the pedometer for a wonderful three weeks before I ran it through the wash. I tried to wear it using the clip on my pants so I could hide it under my shirts, but the clip was so weak that the pedomoeter kept falling off my jeans. So, I resorted to putting the pedometer in my pants pocket every morning. Then, I forgot to take it out of the pocket one day before I did laundry and now it's dead. Lesson learned, but too bad it had to happen this way. Learn from my mistake and don't trust that the clip will hold and don't forget to take it out of your pockets before washing clothing. All in all it was a great pedometer, very easy to use and seemed very accurate."
5,"Such a good product, I bought 3 of them!","I haven't used a lot of pedometers, but the ones I have were chintzy and could add steps just by shaking it. This pedometer works WAY better. The thing I really like about it is that you don't have to clip it to your belt or waist. I always carry mine in my pocket, and it works perfectly. I even bought two more as gifts! And I'll probably buy more in the future!!"
5,Perfect for the price,"I got this to help me improve my limited exercise program following a heart attack. It it the right size and seems well designed and manufactured. Omron provides both belt/pocket clip and lanyard to carry it. It was very easy to set up and displays four main functions -- steps, aerobic steps (fast pace for more than 1 minute) calories burned during aerobic pace, mileage. You set the time and all calculations are automated. At midnight the counters set back to zero automatically for the next day, but the memory buttons lets you review the results for the past 7 days. For the average person who wants to monitor their activity levels, it is perfect and a great value."
5,Best I've used,"After goofing around with cheap pedometers, I wanted something that would work. This one was recommended to me by several people. I like it very much. Accurate, easy to set. etc. Don't waste time on a cheap one -- they don't work. Make the investment in this and you will be happy with it."
4,Keeps you on track,"Since receiving my Omron pedometer, I have tracked every step I've taken. This is a great instrument for keeping you on target if you have a daily exercise goal.A suggestion to the manufacturer: would be really nice if the unit illuminated with the push of a button. Would like the ability to time my steps."
2,Disappointed--simply too big,"With high hopes based on rave reviews here, I ordered this pedometer, but returned it. It is just way too big, particularly for a woman, and I'm a small one - 5'3"". It has the best features of peds I've read about, but when I received it, I was taken back by its size--approx 2"" wide and 3"" tall, very bulky looking. It sits upright on your belt and not securely since it is so tall (it cannot be clipped on belt sideways). The alternate is a good one, which is carry in purse or pocket, but if I wear it all day, which is recommended, I don't carry my purse all day of course and don't always have pants pockets. Even if I did, the size creates a larger bulge than I would like to wear around all day. For men, since they tend to be larger in general and usually have pockets, the pocket option is a great feature. But, not for this little lady! Wish Omron could make this gem smaller."
3,Works fine,"Product is relatively easy to program and, although not exactly accurate, it is close enough for my needs. Never could get the safety hook to work - otherwise it is good"
4,Perfect Pedo!,"I love this pedometer! It is great at keeping up with me, holds days of info and can be washed (OPPS!!)My ONE annoyance is that it is so slick, it slips out of my pocket sometimes! I wish it had a little bit of grip to it."
4,Very accurate!!!,"I originally had a Brookstone pedometer that was not accurate at all (like for every 1 step, it counted 2-3), so someone told me about this one and I ordered it right away. It is soooooooooooooooo accurate. For the whole day, it might be off by like a few steps, but nothing to worry about. The only thing I dont like about it is that it is huge compared to other pedometers, but I would rather have it big and accurate than not. I would definitely recommend this pedometer to everyone."
5,Love my new pedometer,I absolutely love this pedometer. It seems to be very accurate. I wear it all the time....it will even calculate steps if it is left in your purse!!! I would definately recommend this one!!!!
4,Great for walking,"I bought this pedometer because of it's high accuracy rating. It is dead-on accurate if you're walking, or running a consistent stride on flat ground, but unfortunately doesn't hold up for hill work or rough terrain. Where I live, there isn't much flat ground...we're either going up or down whether on the road or a trail. My stride length varies by as much as 6"" or more apparently as I'll get quite different readings on an out & back route. So walkers, go ahead and buy this one. Runners...unless you're on a track or level ground, you'll probably need a wrist-mounted GPS distance-meter which will be my next purchase."
2,Battery replacement big problem,"I have no issue with the pedometer's functioning but the battery compartment is closed with a very small screw which is very easy to drop and not easy to replace. The cover has to fit a small tongue into a slot so the screw must come all the way out and you need a tiny screwdriver for it. The battery costs about $6 but you can't use it if you can't put the cover back on because the tiny screw has disappeared. Easy to use, screw-on cover designs for batteries this size exist that can be opened with a coin, why make it so very difficult?I am looking for something that doesn't waste my time and money so I can go walking."
4,Works as advertised,"I purchased the Omron HJ-112 pedometer for my wife, who has been on a walking regimen. The product description was very helpful and listed the key features clearly. It was simple to set up and works as advertised. She really likes it and has been using it to measure how much walking she does in an ""average"" day as well as her ""power walks"". A very good buy."
5,Walking Wars,"Get two of these and compete with your better half for number of steps each day. Our goal, 10,000 steps per day. This product is easy to use, a good buy, and has a 7 day history. With your weight and stride input you'll get a calorie burn summary as well as a distance summary. Great solution!"
3,Pedometer,"I like this Omron Pedometer. But I do have trouble keeping it clipped to my waist. If it weren't for the safety clip I'd have lost it long ago. Also the reading changes very easily if just barely touched.It is pretty accurate in steps. I don't know if I'll ever get to 10,000 steps, but it helps me keep track and to keep at it. I've tried many pedometers, this one seems to work the best. P Hadley"
3,Omron pedometer bad clip,"I love the functionality of the unit, and the 7 day memory. I have used it for 3 months now, the only drawback would be the clip. The clip keeps falling from my waste band, the clip should be longer with greater tension. I wish the unit came with a different clip, I would even buy another clip for this unit if available."
1,Every little movement counts as a step.,"When I wore this, it would record that I'd walked over a hundred steps when I only walked down the hall. I tried wearing it in different places (waist band, top pocket), but nothing worked. Within a half hour it was recording that I'd walked over 500 steps when in fact, I'd done very little at all. I stopped using it after a few days."
5,Keeps me moving,"Yes, this keeps me moving, I feel not completely dressed without it. Helps me with my pain management & gets me moving after flare days."
4,Easy!,"I bought this pedometer after admiring one a friend was using. It has a large digital display and is easy to set up and use. The case has a great clip, which I fasten to the pocket of my jeans. It also has a safety strap which can be used with or without the case. The unit automatically resets itself to zero at 12:01 am and puts the previous day's steps into the (7-day) memory.I use the pedometer for walking and running. It does not recognize the difference in stride when I'm running, so the mileage recorded is not accurate when I walk and run in the same day. It also considers anything over 60 steps per minute to be aerobic.Altogether I am very pleased with this pedometer and would recommend it to anyone considering buying one. I had another (cheap-o) one I never could figure out and it was flimsy and difficult to read."
1,Of the 3 I bought 1 worked,"I purchased this pedometer because it had the BEST reviews out there. I purchased one for my mom, uncle and myself. Both my mom and my uncle's pedometers would count additional steps or not count steps. We programed them and re-programmed them with no avail. My pedometer seemed okay for the first three months, but then I washed it. Unfortunately it never recovered, so that's my fault, not the pedometer. I would say that the belt clip is doesn't work and will not stay in place. Your best bet is to just put it in your pocket and NOT put it in the wash. I am disappointed that only 1 out of 3 I purchased seemed to work. Hopefully you'll get a good one."
2,A little short,"First the good: Setting up the HJ-112 is easy. The displays are clear and easy to read. Steps and distances are accurately measured. I suppose the calorie counter is accurate but I don't have any way to confirm its accuracy.Next cons: The belt/pant clip is really, really worthless. You must us the safety cord and clip or you will loose the meter. The display is always on; it can't be turned off so the battery is always draining. It would be nice if the display turned itself off after a certain amount of inacitivity to conserve the battery. The meter does not calculate your speed. You can do it yourself if you really want to, the data is supplied by the meter. Distance is measured only in miles; You can't switch between miles and kilometers.Bottom line: it's a competent pedometer; few bells and whistles; very easy to loose if you're not careful."
2,Please read this BEFORE BUYING.,"This does seem to be a wonderful podometer which does deliver everything they say it does. The problem is that it is SO SENSITIVE that if you're riding a car and the road isn't PERFECTLY smoothe, it will register the vibrations as steps!! If it had an on/off switch or a PAUSE BUTTON to turn it off and stop counting steps whenever you're on any motorized vehicle it would be THE perfect podometer.A few days ago I realized at some point in the day that the pedometer was marking waaay to many steps for how inactive I had been that day. I then thought of checking the steps before and after I got into the car and realized that any minor vibration is registered. One would have to write down the number of steps before and after any ride on any motorized vehicle and do the math at the end of every day! I find this extremely frustrating"
4,Pedometer keeps me walking more,"Love this pedometer - fits in your pocket or clipped to it. You can also clip it to a bag and it'll track steps for you. I like that it tracks your entire week (7 days) to watch your progress. Also tells you how many calories you've burned, how many miles your steps equal, and how many aerobic steps you've walked within the day's count. It also keeps time which is handy."
2,Pedometer,"Instructions were not easy to follow. Font size was small. Easy to accidentally push the stop button while wearing it, results for the entire day were lost."
4,Good Purchase,This is a very useful product. We are enjoying using this product. It can motivate people who are really lazy to walk.
2,Some of the functions stopped working,"Bought the pedometer primarily for monitoring distance and speed. After only 4 weeks, the aerobic setting which calculates distance and speed has stopped working. I am really disappointed."
1,No battery???????,"I got this product and it didn't have a battery in it. What a rip off . Kind of basic, isn't it?"
5,Works great!!!,"Works great! And is very accurate, I read a review before I purchased the HJ-112. You'll be happy with the purchase. It fits in my pocket and I have it on all the time. Easy to use too! FYI, no one paid me for this review."
4,Love it but missing one component,"I bought 30 units of this OMRON HJ-112 digital pocket pedometer on behalf of the company to kick of the new year with a wellness program. For each employee who signed up for a Weight Watcher Program, a pedometer was given to them with no cost to the employee. The employees love, love it! The set-up of the pedometer is easy and we have no complaints except for a missing screwdriver that was supposed to be included in the kit."
1,No good,"I bought this pedometer thinking it could track my distance. It only measures the distance you run in relation to your stride length, not actaul mileage. Totally useless."
3,I gave these out as gifts ...,"I bought ten of these as gifts (becaue of the rave reviews I found here).I found that it makes a nice gift because people appreciate it (I toldthem I am giving them out to lots of folks lest they think I think theyare overweight and ""need"" this). But don't expect them to actuallyuse it.Only one of them used it. And he stopped after a week.I myself used it for a couple weeks and stopped only because of a kneeissue.I was disappointed that it's not counting every step (just sitting in my pocket in a vertical - not flat position), but I think it does a decent job of providing a relative indication of how active I have been for the day. Which I guess is all I really will need (once I get my knee back on track if it can take it). I will be hoping to get my first 10,000 step day."
3,nice looking,"I have been using it for a little over a month now and I like the sleek design. it's well made. it works good while I am getting exercise,Like when taking a nice long walk, but it resets itself out of the blue.I have learned to write down my steps every so often because I don't know when it will reset itself. I'm not bumping the button to cause this because you have to hold the button in awhile to reset it."
2,Not accurate!!!,This is my first day using this product and I am very unhappy. I have been counting my steps and checking to see if it's accurate and unfortunately it's not at all. I do daycare and am on my feet from the time I get up until after dinner. I have been on my feet for over 5 hours now constantly walking and it is telling me that I have only walked 2522 steps! It hardly counts steps when I am walking on carpet which 90% of my house is carpet.... I have to say that it is the worst $25 I have spent! I will shake it in my hand as if I am walking and it won't count at all and then all of a sudden it will start counting like it should. POOR POOR product!
5,Pedometer Review,"We have tried several pedometers and the quality of the Omron HJ112 is far and above the others for durability, and performance."
4,Great pedometer,"I bought this pedometer for my wife who said she wanted a 'good one', not like the cheap junky ones she has seen in the past. Well, I went to Target and all of them looked pretty junky. So I went on the web to find a well rated one and this is the one that I came up with. My wife says she likes this pedometer and it works great but the thing that it clips into is kind of bulky. The only thing more I could have asked for is for the entire pedometer to be smaller or at least thinner so that it would be less noticeable in a pocket."
5,Pedometer Review,"I am very pleased with the quality of my Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer. I like that you can check your steps, calories, and miles you've walked just by pressing a button several times and the pedometer keeps a 7 day history so you can track and compare your progress for the week. I've had it about a month now and it's still working very well. It also motivates me to walk more!"
4,"Good, durable, easy to use","Have been walking with this pedometer several miles at a time for 6 months and it does everything right, and resets itself every day to zero, holding the past week's walking activity in memory, by day. I use the belt clip on my waistband or waist pack and it has never fallen off. Have tested its mileage count vs. driving my car over the same distance and it is very accurate."
4,COUNTS MORE STEPS THAN YOU DO,"The pedometer is comfortable to use and it comes with a safety strap which works well to prevent loss. It seems to count more ""regular"" steps than I do but not ""aerobic"" steps. It makes it easier to get to my 10,000 steps a day but the total must be taken with a grain of salt:-)"
1,Not accurate at all,"I have had this for less than a month and I've given up on using it. Ever since I bought the pedometer, I've used it 5x to test its accuracy. I run the same exact route at home and this pedometer has given me 5 different readings each time. Sometimes the difference is over a mile and there's just no way my routes were that much different. I basically bought it to use when I'm out of town but now i'm not confident that this would give me the correct reading. I replaced the battery with a new one thinking the battery might be low but still got the same inaccurate readings. I followed the set-up directions exactly as stated in the manual. I even reset the program just in case I made a mistake on the initial set up but again got different reading of the same distance I ran. I just wish I can return it. Totally not satisfied with it."
3,Not for odometer use,"This product advertises itself as a ""pedometer,"" so I can't be too upset with it. But it also has a function for tracking miles, which did not work at all for me. Over several tests, I found it to be sporadically and unpredictably inaccurate."
3,missing item,I received the pedometer in two days however the battery that was suppose to be included with the product was not so I can not start using it until I go out and purchase a battery myself.
4,As advertised,"I bought the pedometer for the wife as she wanted to see has much she walked during the week. She now uses it when she runs, and goes on walks. More for the info then anything. It works good and easy to use."
5,Highly accurate compared to Mapquest mileage,"I love this device. I love the two clips to make sure I do not lose it. I really love knowing how far I really went--reliably. Compared to the freebie given out by my local bank and one by Eastern Mountain Sports, this one reports the truth, plain and simple, where the other two inflated my efforts by 50% or more.Battery lasts about 6 months."
4,Not Happy But Not Disappointed,"I have to admit that I love this product. I'm very health conscious, so exercise and activity is a big part of my day. I tend to use walking as a my mode of transportation so I like to see what my calorie burn is like in addition to my weekly gym routine.I love the product. It's simple to use and all I do is clip onto the inside of my pocket. The only reason why I gave this product a 4 instead of 5 is because the instructions say you're supposed to be able to switch from kilograms to pounds when putting in your weight and that the stride length is in feet, not inches. I couldn't switch either of these functions out!Other than that, I really like this product."
3,Happy with my purchase,"While I really like this pedomenter, I find the clip pretty bulky. If I didn't use the safety leash, it would be falling off all the time."
5,wear it constantly,"I wear my pedometer daily, as does my husband. We are trying to walk more for health and weight loss. This pedometer makes it fun! It is small enough to be unobstrusive."
5,omron hj 112,"Checked Consumer's Report, read other reviews on here and chose this device. It works well, it's encouraged me to walk more so it has the payback I wanted. Definitely a good buy."
4,Good product,I've been using this pedometer for a month now and it's working great. Very accurate and easy to use. Get a book to structure a program for your self.
3,Omricon pedometer,I purchased the pedometer for an upcoming hiking vacation and for overall use after the vacation. I took the instruction book along to adjust all the settings. I purchased the unit based on positive feedback and ratings. The unit works fine but WARNING the supplier I purchased from did not include a battery for the unit. I ended up on vacation ready to use it and adjust settings to find out after finding a small enough tool for the back screws that the unit was missing a battery. Totally out of luck and this was never mentioned in the description anywhere that batteries not included. Had to order batteries when I returned home. Real bummer !
5,Excellent pedometer for the price!,"I've tried $5-10 pedometers before and they were terribly inaccurate d/t shuffling of waistbands, like when using the restroom, or jumping in and out of vehicles--extra steps counted but not taken. I can shake this pedometer and jump around in one place and it will not count the movements as steps--thank goodness! I am an RN and work a variety of shifts and wanted to know which shifts I was the most active on and keep track of how busy I am each shift and this little guy helps keep track and accurately calculate that. I love it and believe it is definitely worth the money!"
4,The Omron HJ-112,"This pedometer is the third (different brands) we have tried, the Omron HJ112 is the best so far. . We have two, one seems to be a little more accurate then they other. The belt clip holds quite well on the waist band and even works upside down in the pocket. There is an extra strap securing the pedometer in place if the clip itself comes loose. It has many features, we use only two. After 24 hours it zero's out the steps, but one can check accumulated steps using the menu. We believe this item is worth purchasing."
2,Doesn't work for running.,"I bought this for running. I read all reviews and thought it would be a good choice, but it wasn't. I'm sure it's great for walking, but I will definitely be searching elsewhere for a running pedometer."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this pedometer and was immediately impressed with the accuracy. However, there are two problems that I find aggravating. First, the clip is not the right size, it should allow the pedometer to be tightly attached, not loosely attached at the top of the garment. Second, the pedometer resets to zero at least once a day. After a reset, the only way to get the total steps for that day is to go to the memory of the ""previous"" day. Of course, it is not the previous day, it is only the number of steps that were recorded before the pedometer reset itself."
5,"Best pedometer, most accurate I have ever had!","This is the best pedometer I have ever owned by far. It's very accurate! It helps me to stay on target daily with my steps. My steps have doubled since I've bought this product and some days tripled. Before I wasn't getting the healthy number of steps which is 10,000 a day. Now I get that plus some. I range between 20,000 and 35,000 a day. I walk between 10-12 miles a day on most days which is a lot of wallking lol. This is a must buy product you will not regret your purchase."
3,"Good, but not great","The Omron HJ-112 pedometer is an overall good product and a pretty good value for the money. It does have some major functional flaws however. For example, you can't turn it off, so even when you're not using it it is burning down battery power. You also have to lay it completely flat when you carry it in the car otherwise it will interpret each bump as a step (and like I said you can't just turn it off). I drove to work (about 5 miles) in my car and it calculated that i had walked 108 steps while I was driving. Also, it will only record your steps for seven days and then the data is erased. So if you want to know how many steps you took over the period of a month or year you'll have to write it down yourself.The pedometer itself is very small, unobtrusive and attractive so the overall design is good, but the electronics are a little off. An overall decent product however."
5,Can't believe it survived my washing machine.,"I was carrying my pedometer in my pocket to see how close I was to the 10,000 steps a day recommendation. That was an eye-opener! I thought I was an active person but I wasn't even close. Anyway, the third day I used it, I didn't even notice that it was still in my pocket when I threw my jeans in the washer. I was sick that I'd ruined it so soon. I unscrewed the back cover, took out the battery and left everything to dry for a couple days. I could hardly believe it when I put it back together and it worked fine. Needless to say, I won't be doing that again. Set-up is easy, just don't try to do it in a hurry. You need to have enough time to measure and enter an accurate stride length."
5,ped review,Great product. Really appreciate the additional attachment which makes sure that I don't drop the pedometer off my waistband and onto the floor. Checked against hiking trails and seems to be very accurate.
4,I just wish I had more time to use it,"This is a nice, well made sleek little unit. Very user friendly. Easy to wear. I just wish I had more time (and self discipline) to use it on a daily basis."
5,Great buy for the money,I purchased 3 of these great pedometers. I gave one to my son and one to my wife. I kept the third one for me. I use it almost every day and can say that it works perfectly.
2,Worst. Clip. Ever.,"While I love the accuracy and the features of this pedometer, it WOULD NOT stay attached to my ordinary men's leather belt. I can't count the number of times it just slipped off and fell to the ground, and after about a month of use one of those falls permanently disabled the display. If you can find a way to keep it attached, great; if you're planning to clip it on to your belt or waistband, expect it to destroy itself in 1-2 months of use."
5,Wonderful Product,I purchased this Omron pedometer several years ago. It is highly accurate. I love the aerobic and 7 day memory features. It is such a good product that I am purchasing a new one since my other one went through the wash.
2,Difficulty getting accurate reading,"I was hoping this would be easy to program but it is not. I cannot get my weight (97 pounds) to enter the program. No matter what I put it, various weights, it jumps to 108 pounds. This would not be accurate for me. Calls to the #800 directed me to the website for assistance. Two e-mails to the site elicited no response from ""customer service"". I took the unit to a personal trainer and she was unable to program it as well. It is sitting with the battery ticking away, doing nothing for me."
5,"Love, love, love it!","I'm really not one for doing reviews, but felt compelled to because of this little gadgit. I just love this pedometer it has the features I was looking for and it was so easy to set up. I had a Gaiam pedometer that I liked but the clip design was poor and it fell off my waist band and broke. It was difficult to set up, I eventually to it to my son and he set it up for me. I purchased another brand to replace it and couldn't figure it out so returned it. Got another which I couldn't set up and gave it away. I received my Omron on Saturday and was able to set it up within a few minutes, it was so easy. Once it was set I tried it out and I mentally counted the steps as I walked. The pedometer was right on, it gave the same number as I had counted. I love the clip feature and the safety teather. I only walk so don't know how it works for jogging or running, but it serves my purpose perfectly and I love it."
3,Not the buy it use to be.,Price has almost doubled and the design has changed even though the model number is still the same. Design specs say it is slimmer but when compared to the previous 'same model' it's thicker and mounts at a different angle.Quality of items is still excellent.I will not purchase this item again since the price has almost doubled.
2,No Good,Had no idea how to use it... read instructions make it easier to use... I tossed it into the trash a week later.... two stars for design and price.
1,Sucks,This is the worst. I used it three times and did not put it through any rough wear. It just stopped working!!! You sold me a piece of garbage. You should be ashamed.
1,Excellent Pedometer,"I have purchased several Pedometers in the past even one that was recommended by Consumer Report that counted steps even when I wasn't moving. In addition the clip broke when I tried to put it on my belt. My sister bought the Omron HJ112 and the fact that it stores several days of data was very helpful and it also resets itself each morning so that I can grap it and run out the door. I wear it at work and when I work out at the gym. Several friends plan to purchase this item because I told them how well it works compared to those they purchased. I highly recommend this pedometer to people who want to count their steps with the 10,000/day goal of good health."
1,No Battery!,The pedometer booklet says it includes a battery. All it included was a black rubber foam circle where the battery should be.Now I have to buy a battery! I definitely feel cheated by this company and do NOT recommend this product.
5,pedometer,This is by far the best pedometer i have ever purchased. It was so good that I have since purchased 3 others for my family. Thank you!
3,lacking reset button,This is a good pedometer the only thing it is lacking is a reset button for trip millage. The previous pedometer had one and I miss it.
4,Pretty Incredible...,"I have purchased MANY different pedometers in the past, and all have not come close to the quality of this one. What I love about this pedometer is its accuracy. I've placed the pedometer in my pocket, hooked onto my pants in my purse and count my steps and it's right on every time. I also love the fact that I don't have to reset every morning. Because it has a clock, it resets itself, pretty cool. The only reason why I don't give it a five is because the steps I take don't add up to the mileage walked. I've taken up hiking lately and know for a fact the hike is at least 5 miles, however on the pedometer it reads a little over 4 miles. Not sure why it does this. Steps are accurate but the mileage is not...hmmm. I would still so recommend this to anyone who is looking for an affordable, incredible, pretty cool pedometer!"
5,Step by step,The pedometer is extremely precise once you've calibrated it to you gait. Nice large read out and the clip-on cord has save me from losing it more than once.
4,Need to improve the clip but otherwise very nice,"Then, I forgot to take it out of the pocket one day before I did laundry and now it's dead. Lesson learned, but too bad it had to happen this way. Learn from my mistake and don't trust that the clip will hold and don't forget to take it out of your pockets before washing clothing. All in all it was a great pedometer, very easy to use and seemed very accurate. I owned the pedometer for a wonderful three weeks before I ran it through the wash. I tried to wear it using the clip on my pants so I could hide it under my shirts, but the clip was so weak that the pedomoeter kept falling off my jeans. So, I resorted to putting the pedometer in my pants pocket every morning."
5,digital pedometer,"I love my pedometer, and use it daily! It is amazing how many miles I have walked every day at work, without my knowing it!"
5,Durable,"I love this, it is a great motivator. This is durable, and it really stays clipped. I have had others that always seemed to fall off, but this one is great."
2,"Karen D, Texas","I recently ordered the Omron pedometer based on the glowing reviews it had and have been very disappointed. The size of the unit makes it inconvenient and bulky. It is top heavy which results in it being easily knocked off by a purse or just the natural movement of your arm. The clip is not sturdy enough to hold the unit in an upright position. Being so large (larger than some pagers)it is embarrasing to wear since it tends to draw attention. The step counting mode seem to be fairly accurate. The mile counter is not even close. After setting my stride length a couple of times and walking 4 miles on a treadmill (interval walking 4-5 mph) it showed about 2.5 miles. I used a Digi-Walker for many years and was extremely satisfied with its overall performance. Lesson learned, stick with what works for you."
4,Susie's Review,The pedometer is very accurate and has a lot of features. I like the strap that helps keep you from losing it as it is big and bulky. If you want to wear it all the time it would be hard to conceal since it is so large. I had another Omron pedometer that I liked better because it was small and the clip was more secure however the HJ-112 is more accurate and has more features.
2,Pedometer,"I found this pedometer difficult to figure out even though I read the instruction book. I had to turn to my more tech-savvy son and even he had difficulty. If that doesn't deter you, its actually a nice product...counts both steps and miles. very light and easy to clip on clothes."
5,Pedometer Omron HJ-112,"This product is very satisfactory. It does everything in the description, and the aerobic and other steps being counted is great to be divided."
5,Pedometer,This is pedometer is the best I have ever bought. The accuracy is onceset is as good as you will ever need. I recomend it highly. Price is excellent.
2,"Very poor consumer service, if you are not under warranty","Just lost the screw that locks in the battery in it's place. It's a very small screw, impossible to find anywhere, believe me I tried. I called Omran to get the part which I was willing to pay for, however, I was told that because I'm no longer under warranty, they will not be able to help me.totally crazy....."
3,Decent pedometer,This pedometer is great in every way except that it doesn't have a stop/start button and you cannot clear the recording of your miles. It just goes into a 7 day cycle every 24 hours.
3,Maybe not for runners,"Consumer Reports lists this as their top pick. For certain activities, I'm sure it deserves its ranking. If you are a runner however, this may not be your best choice. There are two main drawbacks. First, there is no reset. You can't step up to the line for a run and reset the timer to zero. It resets by itself at midnight and tracks movement all day. It has a system reset but that clears your weight and stride information. Second, the timer counts only whole minutes. Runners generally want to be timed to the second.The former Consumer Reports number one pick, the Freestyle Pacer, has dropped in quality as well as their rankings. The display on the last couple of units I have owned either wash out or don't display portions of the digits.I'm not sure what the best inexpensive alternative for runners would be."
2,not worth the money,this pedometer had great review but doesn't do the mileage correct at all. I ran a route and then drove it and the pedometer was off almost a mile
5,Love my pedometer!,I love keeping track of my steps daily. It's a great way to keep me moving. Love it and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is wanting to track their movement and walking.
1,Not Durable,"Great at first, but after a year's use no longer accurate, even after a battery change. It now gets stuck while counting steps and has to be jarred to continue. I admit it has been dropped a few times while running but was in its plastic case holder to protect it. If i had reviewed this product six months ago I would have given it five stars. Now i need to throw it away, like garbage."
4,Good but not perfect,"I bought this pedometer to keep track of how far I walk on the golf course. It is easy to set-up and use however the one feature I found lacking is a start and stop button. It resets every night at midnight and keeps track of all steps within a 24 hour period. And it does a good job at that. However it has no way of isolating one specific event. Other than that, I think it is a great little gadget."
5,the best pedometer I've ever used!,"Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium PedometerI have tried more than 10 pedometers before this one. I set them up, wore them on several walks that I knew the distance for, and with great disappointment when they all were off by enough to be laughable, threw them into my pedometer discard drawer. But I have logged several hundred thousand steps with this one in the past four months and it is still going strong and with great accuracy. If you choose this one, you may never need to buy another pedometer."
5,Let's Walk!,I was reading a review on this pedometer and ordered it to help me help myself by keeping track of my daily travels. It is amazing how easy it is to use and how it helps me go a little further each day. I have a basic goal and it is fun to go over as often as possible. It is the easiest pedometer I have used and the big numbers are great.
2,Display stopped working after a week,"The product started out working well, but unfortunately the display screen stopped working after only a week...You can still see about half the numbers so it's kind of still functional, but still very disappointing...I hope I can find my receipt..."
4,Great pedometer but you have to use the safety leash,I purchased this pedometer several weeks ago and have enjoyed having it immensely. I did however note that some other reviewers rated the clip rather poorly. I have also found this area to be the weakest in the Omron. My pedometer falls off of my waist as many as 10 times a day. If it weren't for the safety leash it would have either been broken or lost as I don't always notice when it releases. The pedometer's saving grace is it's safety leash. This little clip is strong and hangs in there so that when the pedometer falls it just swings at the end of the leash. At first I thought it was a pain having the two clips and if I'm not careful it hinders reaching into my pocket but it's totally worth it.
5,What a great gadget!,"I just started walking to try to lose some weight, and based on reviews here, bought this pedometer. This is a wonderful tool. The seven day memory is great, as it challenges you to do better than the last day. I also like the fact that it shows miles walked. As a test of accuracy, I used it with my GPS. The GPS showed 3.05 miles, while the Omron showed 3.15. So it is quite accurate.Overall a great gadget, well worth the price!"
5,Omron HJ-112 Pedometer,"This is everthing as advertised. Lightweight, comfortable and works terrific. I wear it every day and find it very motivating to keep moving!"
5,Best One Out There,My husband is a board certified Family Practice Physician. I manage his medical practice. We offer medically supervised weight loss programs through our office and every one that goes through the program gets the Omron HJ-112! Dr. Armistead personally used this prior to us starting our weight loss programs and did so after MUCH research as always on all the pedometers out there!! Highly recommended in my & Dr. Armistead's opinion!!
5,Better then others,This is my third pedometer purchased. The others were too sensitive to position and either didn't measure steps or counted them twice. The 112 is intuitive to use and appears to be quite accurate. It is far superior to other brands I have owned
4,great,"This pedometer was a little difficult to set up. My husband is an engineer, and think he read too much into it. LOL. I kept reminding him, ""this is not a missle"". However, after the hour it took to set up, we were very happy. Works perfectly,very accurate and it motivates me. The strap is nice, has a very tight grip and special lock. The only thing is it doesn't keep track of movements on an exercise bike. But that's OK. My husband uses it on the treadmill, and it works there. I like the readable numbers, so I don't have to get my glasses! Great product, and our health insurance gives us credit for taking a proactive health stance."
3,Excellent until it disappears...,"This pedometer is easily a five star pedometer. It was easy to use, easy to set and read, and for the brief time I had it I thought it was the best pedometer I have owned.Unfortunately, after 4 days it disappeared from my belt. The clip is completely unsatisfactory, and if you keep it on a belt you will loose it.If you plan to carry it anywhere else, it would probably be worth buying, but do not count on the clip to secure it to your person."
4,Less Accurate than I hoped,It is very quiet but I find that it is not that accurate. If I walk 100 steps it will register 150. It is convenient since you can put it in your pocket and forget about it.
1,Useless,"This is calibrated wrong or just defective because it nearly doubles the amount of steps you take, making it completely inaccurate and useless. It also added steps when I was sitting down. I also couldn't figure out a way to reset it once it started (inaccurately) counting my steps for the day.Save your money!"
1,Worked great at first,"Worked great for about 3 wks then nothing, replaced the battery and worked great for 2 days and now back to no recorded steps."
5,Best so far,I have owned several pedometers all of which are still working. However this Omron model is the best one yet. It does not rattle like some and it is the right size.I like the mode choices and the memory function and is easy to use. Also a great design. I highly recommend this model.I am Canadian and purchased two while in the U.S. and then purchased another in Canada as a gift. The Canadian model is metric whereas the U.S. model is non metric. Neither model can be converted.
5,omron pedometer,"The omron HJ-112 digital premiun pedometer works very well.A very nice product.It would be nice if the belt clip on the back was a little longer to catch on a 1 1/2"" wide belt."
4,"Quiet, dependable","I had only one other experience with a pedometer, a cheap one that came with a meal from McDonalds. It wasn't very accurate and made an annoying clicking noise while you walked. The Omron HJ-112 showed me what a good pedometer is like. The instruction manual it comes with is very clear and it was easy to program. I like being able to read aerobic steps in addition to regular steps, and the fact that it converts steps to miles and even calculates calories burned makes it a great little tool. Plus, it's quiet - no annoying clicks like cheaper pedometers. It seems to be quite accurate, too. The little extras like the cord to attach it to your belt in case it slips out of its holder are nice additions. It would be nice if the seven day memory feature allowed you to view aerobic steps along with regular steps, but you can't ask for everything.Overall, this is a great little pedometer that will make keeping track of your daily walk a breeze."
4,Omron pocket pedometer,"I was disappointed with the belt clip for the pedometer,a s I lost my pedometer within 1 week of buying it because I didn't feel it fall off my pants. The safety clasp does hold well, I did connect it when I purchased my second pedometer. I love the fact that I can even wear the unit in my bra and it is accurate!"
2,OK..... FOR A WHILE,"Researched A LOT, tried almost as many (my research/purchases say stay away from SPORTLINE anything), before purchasing this Omron, considered top -of-the-line. And, yes, it worked well -- until the battery ran out and needed to be replaced. Now, either it records inaccurately (walking briskly for 45 minutes took 545 steps, none of them aerobic???), or the readout is 0.Bummer. Pretty costly for it to work only a few months.Buyer beware."
2,Annoying,"One star: featuresone star: ease of usingOther than that, it was inconsistant, when on a known distance, track, got different readings. Cant reset to zero once arriving at a starting point. Ex: walk from car to starting point, it keeps track, then have to subtract when you reach starting point. Which is annoying, not having to zero it out without resetting everything every time. Sent it back."
1,Don't buy this if.......,"Don't buy this if at the end of the day you want to know how many steps, converted to miles, you walked that day. This is a slick looking pedometer that is pretty tricky to set, and even trickier to get the info you want out of it. I started out at zero steps, walked and counted 100, HJ-112 read 62. Unless I clear all the settings, and reset them, I cannot begin again to try for an accurate count. I am very disappointed in this, given the amount of research I did before purchasing it. Ruby [[ASIN:B0000U1OCI Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer] I bought this through Amazon, where I buy mostly books."
4,Worth the money ...,"After having bought the Nike Fit smart chip twice, I had to return it the first time. The second Nike Chip lasted only a week! With that disappointment lingering, I purchased this pedometer and I have to admit how happy I am. It works like a hi-tech gadget, I don't have to switch it on or off and it records automatically. I have used it almost a week now and the battery lasts for 6 months. The only drawback is that it does not have a USB cable or software to present your periodic excercise activity! However, for the money you pay, you get more than what you bargained for."
1,Omron customer service leaves much to be desired.,"I actually don't know how well this pedometer works because as I was installing the battery, I dropped the tiny screw that holds the battery in. I called Omron CS and was told that they don't offer just the screw for sale or otherwise and that I would have to buy a whole new pedometer.Yeah, right. I will -- someday -- and it won't be an Omron."
2,Gone already,"Already lost this unit. The technique to hold it on your belt need serious work because I already lost it walking. It seemed to work ok for the short time I had it but it's a poor design cause it is supposed to measure your walking steps, etc. and it fell off somewhere I was walking. Won't buy another of these. Needs a strap in addition to the clip (like a surfboard strap) to prevent the customer from loosing it right off."
5,Pedometer,"Use this religiously everyday trying to follow the 10,000 steps a day diet and it has kept me on perfect track of my weight loss. Love it!!"
5,Motivational,"This product works great. Easy to use, resets itself each day, keeps track of a few previous dayys. I wear it all the time to motivate myself to move more."
5,pedometer gets me walking,"This product is easy to use and helps me/reminds me to work toward my goal of 10,000 steps per day."
5,the reviews are true,"I read plenty of reviews before purchasing, and this product lives up to the glowing comments. I like that it's extremely small, because I carry a lot of things in my pockets. I have accidentally hit the wrong button a time or two; I was briefly confused but lost no data. One thing I didn't notice in the reviews I read is that the automatic re-set that occurs daily happens at midnight. The first time this happened (I was still awake) I thought it was broken. I use it strictly to count steps, not calories or distance. It's easy to install the battery, too. Very clever of them to package in the screwdriver."
3,Not Bad,"Every pedometer will have some errors counting steps, this one has the same issue with incorrect counts mostly on the higher side. Other than that no other qualms pedometer is compact , easy to setup and use. Programming feature are pretty simple,manual is very helpful. Was expecting more accurate piece for $20, overall satisfied with the product."
2,Goes through batteries,"There's no way to turn off this pedometer. The battery lasts about two months. However, if you buy the batteries on line, they're cheap."
4,works great but...,It does everything it promised but the instructions on using it are too too brief. A little time and effort and you can figure it out but they could make a better effort at the instructions
5,Great Product!!,Don't waist your time with one of those cheap pedometers or the free ones that you find in a cereal box. This is one of the best pedometers on the market! I loved it so much that I purchased a second one for my wife. Now we both can walk with multifunctional accuracy!
4,finally a gadget that works,"I purchased this pedometer hoping to get one that would keep track of what I walked,and for how long. This instrument is great. It has a clock on it and it measures time walked, calories burned,aerobic steps and # of steps. Once set (which is easy)you don't have to touch it again. It remembers what you did for the week. I would recommened this pedometer to anyone that seriously cares about their walking."
5,Omron HJ-122 Digital Pre Pedometer,"This is an excellent product! The features are user friendly and easy to learn. The Pedometer has been used daily since it's arrival and has been a very valuable data provider for our daily walking program. I highly recommend this one! Also, Amazon's fast shipping and service was the best!"
4,Love It But Can't Hold On To It,"I bought this product twice because it is a really good pedometer. However, the first time I lost it and do not know where. I started gaining weight again and decided to get another because it was such a great motivater and pretty accurate. Again, after only about 3 months of use, I lost the second one. I would suggest the company make something that will truly secure the pedometer on your person. It costs too much money to keep purchasing it over and over and you can't actually find it in the stores!"
4,Motivated by a Pedometer,"The Omron Pedometer is a fun new gadget. It's amazing how many steps I take in an ordinary day. If the number is low on any given day, it's a subtle motivator to take an after dinner walk. My only suggestion to Omron is to rewrite the somewhat confusing directions."
4,Only problem is the User,"This works great, it really does, but I cannot figure out how to use some of the features."
4,I love this pedometer,"This is the third pedometer I have had and by far the best. I would have given it five stars but as others have noted, the display does not turn off and I expect the battery will go out at around the 6 month mark. It is really easy to set up and use, and it has been pretty accurate."
4,pretty good,"i would say this product is pretty good...coz it's only accurate when i'm walking, but when i started to jog, doesn't seem to give a good result or when i'm on a bicycle..but i guess the latter is quite understandable. other than that, i like everything about it. having a pedometer encourages me more to walk to reach my target goal of 10,000 steps or more."
5,excellent quality,This pedometer is great. Got a high rating in Consumer Reports. The price was right too.
4,A Very good Pedometer,"I have owned several pedometers, most worked poorly. This one does all it claims, the only drawback I have is the the face is not protected if you wear it on your belt, as I do. So far I have not scratched it. It would have been nice to have a cover to protect the face. Worth the money, much better than the cheaper models."
4,Ease Of Use,"This Omron pedometer has a large easy to see read-out, is quite accurate and has a thoughtful design including a clip attachment so you won't lose your device while walking. This being my 3rd pedometer purchase I will say 'The 3rd time is the charm!'"
4,Easy and accurate,"had the hubby take a piece of chalk and mark the street...ran my ten steps to gauge the distance, averaged the six marks, and ran around the block. then i went to run.com and measured my run...the pedometer measured .36 miles, and run.com measured .37!! so pretty accurate! and easy to set up and use. you just have to get your husb to actually do it! (or i guess you could do it yourself huh!?)"
5,I love this gadget!!!,This pedometer is the one I have been waiting for. It works in my pocket and is accurate and easy to set. I have been using it for about two weeks and it has really helped me see how much more I need to walk. Three of my friends are buying one they have heard me rave about it so much. You will love it too.
4,Wouldn't be without it,"This is not the first pedometer I have had, but it is the best. It is easy to read, easy to wear, and has all the features one needs for walking. It re-sets itself overnight which is a nice convenience. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5, is because the clip that attaches the strap to clothing breaks after a while. I wear it everyday all day."
4,"Accurate for walking, not jogging","This pedometer is quite accurate when I'm walking, but I've noticed that when I jog on my treadmill, the pedometer falls behind the mile count on my treadmill. I'm new to pedometers, so perhaps this is typical since walking and jogging strides are not the same. Just something to be aware of if you are planning on using the pedometer to track your distance while jogging."
5,pedometer happy,"Very, very accurate. The safety cord keeps me from losing or dropping the device (I've lost so many already). The price is great for the device functions. Does not click every time you take a step. I've bought one for myself which I have had for 2 years then, just recently, bought one for my daughter. I have seen positive reviews in both Health magazine and Prevention of the very same model. I have recommended it to my friends."
5,Good motivator for getting more walking exercise,"Easy set-up instructions, easy to use, accurate, reasonable price. I've always found Omron products to be good value. No more needs to be said."
4,"Very accurate and lightweight, great device for the price.","I got this as a combo deal with the HBF-400, the weight scale, I wasn't really in need of a pedometer but I thought I might as well keep one handy moreso cause it was on sale. I've used it a couple of times to see how many steps I cover in a day, and it was very accurate down to the calories and miles I walked. The menus and settings are not very intuitive and you do need to read the guide to use all the features, especially for setting your step size."
4,"After learning how to use the pedometer, it works well.",Setting up the pedometer is slightly complicated. It takes a while to learn how to access all the displayed measurements. We measured the stride and then adjusted the measurement after comparing results with known distances. Now the pedometer is quite accurate.
5,Watch your step,"Easy to use, accurate, small, clips on, memory, simple awareness of how active your days are. You automatically look for ways to increase your steps in a daily routine. Omron products are the best!"
5,Omron HJ-112 Pedometer,"After buying two 'cheap' pedometers from the local big box store, I finally bit the bullet and bought the Omron HJ-112 based on written reviews. There is no comparison. The Omron is well worth the money. It does everything the spec sheet says it will do with ease of operation. I am very satisfied with this product and would purchase it again."
5,Fabulous pedometer,"Tired of the cheapy pedometers that constantly reset themselves if you bump them the wrong way? Then this is the way to go! Spend a little more money and be completely satisfied!I do not have one complaint about this pedometer. I have been using it for a year, and have just recently had to replace the battery.Really is a keeper!"
3,"Good, helps me keep track of my walking","The only problem i have with this is that mine NEVER turns off!! It doesn't have an ""Off"" button, which wastes battery life. But it does keep track of my walking. It has Miles, Aerobic Steps, KCAL, and regular Steps counted. It is tricky to think it is actually accurate because when i shake it up and down as if im walking, it jumps up to 100 steps when i haven't even walked yet. Please do yourself a favor and get a pedometer that has an ""Off"" button!! Especially if you are money-conscious."
5,Great choice!,"User friendly except I can't remember how to change the time for daylight-savings time.Dad always said, ""When all else fails, read the directions."""
4,Great buy!,I wanted a pedometer for when I walk and run and it seems pretty accurate. I just wish there was a way to turn it off completely to save the battery.
3,Good Pedometer if you Don't Lose It,This pedometer worked great for about a week until it fell off while I was hiking. I was hiking off trail so it was impossible to go back and find it. I recommend getting a leash or safety strap to go with it.
2,should not have bought,"yes it's very accurate. But, it pokes me, it falls off, it's top heavy and drives me nuts. I had an eagle accusplit for 6 years, it never poked me, and never fell off for 6 years. The new omron has been in a drawer now, and I guess I'll get another eagle."
1,Worst piece of CRAP!,This Omron Pedometer is a poorly designed piece of CRAP!One cannot re-set the counter to zero.Whoever heard of a pedometer not being able to be reset???WTF!
3,Omron Step Counter,Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium PedometerI am wearing this during walks and workouts and at the end of the day it is about 1000 steps less than the Timex--T5011 that I wear also. I do not know which one is the most accurate.
5,Best pedometer around,I really like the omron pedometer. As stated you can carry it in your pocket. It doesn't have to hook on your waistband or your shoe. It counts the steps accurately while giving you other info such as calorie count.
4,Does what it should,"This was the 3rd pedometer I tried. Finally, one that works as it should. I like this one because it is fairly easy to use, I can track for a week at a time and it holds its settings. The previous models I tried would reset to easily (read unintentional resets)and so I was unable to get accurate totals each day.I like this model and would recommend to anyone."
5,Don't take the risk...,"Use the security clip and lanyard provided. Attach the clip to a pocket or waistband so that when the pedometer is knocked loose or falls off it will still be tethered to you by the lanyard.I wear my Omron HJ-112 at work, when exercising, hiking and around the house. I knock the unit loose from waistline at least half a dozen times a day, andOmron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometerwithout the clip my pedometer would've been lost the first day I used it.Have peace of mind and keep on moving with an excellent product."
4,great product,Just returned from a hiking vacation in Michigan. Wore this on all my hikes. It was slightly off of what the trail markers indicated was trail length but not by much <5%. Very well built and durable. Highly recommend
5,Easy to use,I have cosistently used the Omron HJ-112 pedometer. It is easy to program and is consistent with its calucations (these types of things are not absolute). It attaches well to a waist band and stays in place even when playing tennis.
1,"Not accurate, falls off, difficult to use","After reading many great reviews, I bought 4 of these units. I wish I hadn't. It doesn't measure steps accurately (and that was for all 4 units used on 4 different people). It also falls off regularly; the clip isn't sturdy. To set this is not impossible but it's no easy task either. But that doesn't even matter if it doesn't tell you how many steps you've taken. Save your money on this one and get one that is more basic and more reliable. This ain't it."
1,product defective,"The product could not be programmed so that it would work. I followed the directions exactly, but the product did not do what the directions said it would. I returned the pedometer to Amazon."
1,Junk,I am yet to get get this Pedometer to work properly. I would love to return this for a refund or find a better pedometer that is simple to use and will work properly.
4,Bought for Co-worker as a Secret Santa Gift...,"I honestly don't know much about Pedometers, but this was recommended to me through Amazon's ""Find the Perfect Gift"". My co-worker is a deligent walker so when this was recommended I had a ""duh, why didn't I think of that?"" moment.From looking at it THROUGH the packaging, it looks like a good little unit. It is a little larger then some, but nothing that would be too irritating. It supposidly comes with a strap AND clip so it lessens your chance of dropping or loosing it. All around, it looks like a good product - I will just have to wait and see what my co-worker says after she calibrates and uses it! :-)"
1,Does not work well,This pedometer does not work very well. The clip does not hold firmly and it has fallen off my belt several times. I would not recommend it and I plan to buy another different kind soon.
3,Nice to know how far I walk at work.,"Nice to know how far I walk. However, setup wasn't exactly easy and I'm not sure if I calculated my stride correctly."
4,An excellent pedometer,"I've had this pedometer for a couple months now and have worn it every day (usually in my pocket) and really like it. It has motivated me to get more steps each day. It is much more accurate than cheaper pedometers that I have tried in the past. I like the aerobic step feature, the safety catch and the 7-day memory. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the face is quite easy to scratch. Just be careful not to carry anything sharp like keys in the same pocket."
4,Very Good,"I had tried numerous Sportline products and found none that worked. This Omron is great.Only drawbacks is you can not turn it off. It seems to reset during the night, but occasionally it doesn't seem to always start up after sitting for a few days. Meaning it doesn't start registering my steps without pushing a few buttons. a strange feature. However, when it gets going again, it is outstanding!"
5,Great Pedometer,Very functional. This pedometer really does a good job keeping track of my steps. I like the aerobic steps option. This really helps me to keep track of my activity level and I like the history. The in-pocket option keeps it on me all the time.
2,worked well until the clip broke,"This pedometer worked well until the clip broke after about 3 months-without the clip, it loses accuracy to the point where there's no point to wearing it. We attempted to contact the manufacturer on a number of occasions but they are unresponsive. Given the way the product is used, the fragility of the clip is disappointing and the inability to get a new one is frustrating. We can't find any way on Omron's website to even purchase a new clip."
4,Pretty Good for the price,"I have tried a couple of other pedometers, this one however is pretty good and is fairly accurate. I used to count the total number of steps for the first 5 days, and the average was within +/- 100 steps.Good idea to buy if you want to get on some kind of a total number of steps program."
5,Outstanding product......,"I have had several different pedometers and been unhappy with them for a number of different reasons. This one functions nicely, is easy to use, can be concealed in your pocket and seems very accurate. I am very pleased with this. Particularly useful is the clip that ensures that you don't lose it. It automatically resets to zero every 24 hours."
1,Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer,"Instructions difficult to use, doesn't turn itself off to save battery, is now stuck on steps so as not to go over 4900. Lower priced pedometer would have done the job without all the bells and whistles that don't work."
4,A Handy Gadget,I had previously had two pedometers that clipped to my belt. I am a very active person and lost both. The Omron clips to my bra and is always there and accurate. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
3,Mediocre Pedometer,I found that this pedometer was not always consistent. I can do the same exact route and the steps can vary greatly. I also no longer have my pedometer because it was always falling off. I was not able to find it the last time it fell off so am now in the market for a new one.
4,Love it for daily use,This pedometer is great and I use it every day. One of the best features is the (safety) strap which keeps it from falling. It seems to be accurate and I love that it keeps track of my aerobic and regular steps.Great buy.
4,excellent but falls off clothes and easy to lose,"I fell in love with this pedometer the moment I held it. It's a joy to look at and hold because it's well designed. However I had it for only three days before I finally lost it. The clip is pretty weak and ineffectual. Perhaps four times in the three days that I had this pedometer, I found it on the ground -- it had fallen off without my noticing -- and another time, my spouse found it in the yard. That's the problem, it's so small and light that you don't notice that it's on or off. I am buying a replacement, but the sting of the loss of the first one will be with me forever."
1,Worthless,"Looks good, and most of the reviews I read rated it highly, but it's worthless. I realized after I was wearing it why so people would love it - because it counts steps that you don't walk - and LOTS of them. I'd walk 20, it would give me 33. I'd walk 5, it would say 17. It's worthless. I had a pedometer years ago that didn't count the first 5 steps, so all the little movements would not count. It was FAR more accurate to all the actual walking. I'm very disappointed with the Omron brand."
5,walkers dream,"I saw a quick glimpse of this item on the Oprah show with Dr. OZ. I already had two pedometers that were too complicated or flat out did not function. I thought I would try once more. It is a great item and I was very pleased with the way it was made-sturdy and how it functioned-like a dream. Be warned-10,000 steps is a heck of a trek. With this item you can at least know how close or far away you are from that goal."
4,"works well, but VERY sensitive!","I bought this pedometer because I liked the aspect of being able to put it in my pocket during the day. However, I have found that it is incredibly sensitive. I teach at the college level and do a lot of writing on the blackboard. I know I don't pace around the room that much, but apparently just moving my arm up and down while writing is enough to make this thing think I am taking many steps. So I learned to leave it in my office while I taught. But otherwise, it is a really great product and very easy to read."
5,Pedometer,"This pedometer is easy to program and also is so handy as it does not have to be clipped on your hip, it can ride in your pocket as well. I love it."
2,Not too impressed!,"First of all, when you place it in the spring clip to attach to your clothing - it's huge! Way too big! My second complaint is that it counts way too many steps - I would count 20 and it would register 35."
3,starting off rocky,"I was so excited to get this item- I wanted to go out walking! But to my dismay...it does not come with a battery:-(. I did have to go buy a 2-pack for 5.99 today. Will update my review after I use it! I went back a read over the ""fine print"" - it weighs it without the battery- was that my clue?"
3,Pocket Ped Fun Gadget,"A Pedometer isn't a life or death purchase, but it is sort of fun to see how far you travel in a day: walking around the office, to and from the subway, taking out the dog, grocery shopping, etc. Pretty easy to set up, and it retains a week of what you've walked to look back. Accuracy is totally dependent on determining a good average measurement for the length of your stride, and they suggest figuring it over a 10 ft distance. I measured out 20ft and walked several times at slow and fast paces to get a better average. I figured in the office and around the house my stride is shorter than when walking outside. It has a neat little feature that records aerobic walking that kicks in when you walk 60 steps per minute for more than 10 minutes."
1,Didn't Even Turn On,"The pedometer I bought just came in the mail today. After cutting myself on the particularly brittle plastic packaging, I opened the unit, followed the instructions for putting in the battery, etc. The unit doesn't even work at all. No display. Nothing. Total waste of money."
2,Good while it lasted,"I was really impressed with this unit when i first got it. I tracked my steps for about 9 months or so before the battery died. I changed out the battery thinking that i could go back to tracking with no problems. Unfortunately I was wrong. Once the battery was changed it couldn't store the time and ran slower then it should have. It now sits on the shelf in my bedroom, not tracking anything but dust growing on it. I gave it 2 stars because it was a great pedometer while it worked."
3,I still don't know how I feel about it,It only counts steps every 10 or so. It's a digital pedometer and I can't figure out if it's more accurate or less than my old one that has a little tick-tock sound coming from it.
4,Omron HJ-112 Pedometer,This device was easy to set up and has give great results for both of us. The extra pocket clip has already saved me from loosing it.
3,"Great function, but why the downgraded design?","Ever since its introduction this has indeed been the gold standard among pedometers in its near perfect accuracy under various conditions. As one reviewer wrote, it initially deserved a MOMA award for its gorgeous design - silver metal, classic simplicity. People always asked about my cool cell phone and I would proudly put it someplace conspicuous. Now it's a tacky blue plastic that I have to try to hide, which makes it a lot less functional. What a pity."
1,Belt Hook Not Secure,I was so looking forward to using my pedometer to help me keep track of my exercise routines. Unfortunately I lost it on my first walk! I secured it to my belt and started on my journey. Somewhere halfway through my walk and home it must have come loose and fell off my belt. I wish I would have placed it in my pocket instead. What an expensive waste of time!
4,pedometer,It is very accurate once you have the settings set.I also like the fact you can carry it in your pocket instead of clipping it to your belt.I do wish it had an on/off switch to save battery life.
4,It works but finding a place to wear it is a challenge.,"It works as advertised and appears to give a pretty accurate reading of the distance you've covered as well as the number of steps counted, etc.The unit should be positioned roughly straight up and down which means you can't just drop it in your pocket. It's too bulky to clip in my shirt pocket.The biggest problem is the clip cannot be trusted to hold onto my belt and eventually falls off, so finding a safe place to wear the unit is challenging."
3,Good purchase,Very pleased with this pedometer. It tracks everthong I wanted it to track and is much more accurate than my previous pedometers.
2,Very disappointed!!,"Since my last pedometer died, I'd been using my ipod as pedometer. It was fine but could make things a little complicated. I started reading reviews on this Omron and it sounded really good. I decided to order it as it wasn't that expensive. I am really disappointed and not at all happy with it. It claims to be slim but once it's in it's clip it seems huge. It catches on doorways, slips off my waistband and is very bulky under clothes. In reality, my ipod did the same thing with a much lower profile! sorry I thought it would work and threw away packaging."
3,Good Entry Level Pedometer... With Some Caveats,"My first pedometer, I've been using the Omron 112 for about two weeks. The Good - on generally level surfaces where steady, uniform pace is possible, this device does an excellent job of tracking steps and distance. The Bad - on less-even surfaces (e.g., hiking trails) or when around the yard, house or work, where uniform strides are interrupted by occasional choppy steps, steps to navigate terrain (e.g., dragging a heal, scuffing a toe), the device inflates steps/mileage. The Ugly - I've noticed that when wearing the device while in my car or SUV it also adds steps/mileage, I assume due to road bumps. So, great where steady, uniform strides are possible; good at giving ""general"" information on less-even terrain; take it off when you're in the car."
5,Great device,"This pedometer is a neat little device. It is slimmer than some others I have had and,therefore, fits nicely into my pocket. It seems to do a decent job of counting my dance steps when hidden away there."
4,Good pedometer,"I have used several pedometers over the last 6 years. This one is one of the more accurate units I have used when looking at counting continuous motion.The unit is nice and light weight. I only notice it when it falls off the belt.It does not always count two or three steps I make at work, when having to change working locations. This is not a problem for me as I am after a general count not a records. If I want every bound the pedometer takes counted I would use my sportline.The clip on the meter frequently becomes detached from my belt. The pedometer them hangs off its leash waiting for my to clip it back on.A better Belt clip would be a great enhancement to this product!"
4,good value but does miss some steps,For ~$20 this is a very good pedometer. The clip feature is nice and I like that it stores data for 1 week. My only gripe is that it doesn't seem to count every single step taken. I bought this pedometer because I sit at a desk all day and thought it would motivate me to get up from my desk and walk around more often and it has done just that. I'm sure if you wanted to spend the money you could find a more accurate pedometer but for short $ you really can't go wrong with this guy.
4,"Pleased, but would make one change","I like everything about this product except how it clips onto a waistband! Because of the shape and the loose clipping mechanism, it tends to fall off very easily if I bend over at all and it is very bulky at the waistline. Otherwise, it is my best friend and travels with me everywhere!"
4,Great item...,"I do alot of walking on my job, I just didn't realize how much until I picked up this up. I think the steps are off by a few, but it keeps me on track. If I don't get my 10,000 steps in a day at work, I try an finish it off when I get home."
5,Get Walking!,We bought Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer for our department at work. We have had the product 4 weeks. It has opened peoples eyes on how sedentary they can be in an office environment. And it has started us to consciously take time in our day to walk more. The counts are accurate and adjustable distance to personalize to the size of your stride for distance. Excellent and economical product.
5,Great Pedometer,"I have been using another Omron product that I purchased through my fitness center at work for the 10,000 steps challenge and had been using it for several months when I lost it while walking. I purchased this because it is more secure, with two ways to attach. It also said that it could count while in a pocket or even in a purse. I was suprised by how much I like it better than the other model. It is sturdier, more reliable about picking up steps and counting the mileage. I like the fact that it keeps 7 days in memory and has an aerobic walking tracking in addition to pure steps. I highly recommend this model."
4,Good product and good value,"The product is fairly accurate and a good value. Some of the cheaper pedometers are not very accurate. We had another pedometer that had voice prompts at certain times, distances and steps that was very good too, but it broke. We've really enjoyed using this one and found it very helpful with our walking for weight loss program."
4,great product,This my second purchase of this pedometer. I accidentally soaked it in the washing machine. I tried a different pedometer. I was very unhappy with it. I came back to the Omron pedometer. I am very happy with this product.
2,extremely inaccurate pocket pedometer,"Put plainly, this pedometer does not work as advertised. I specifically paid the rather steep price for this pedometer in order to have one that could be kept in a pocket rather than on a belt clip. It does not work at all when in a pocket. When using the belt clip the pedometer accurately records forceful strides on hard surfaces such as roads and long linoleum hallways. It drastically undercounts leisurely walking such as in your home and also drastically undercounts walking on carpet. Depending on the day's schedule I estimate it undercounts by 25-40%. Perhaps it would work better for a heavier person (I am 130 lbs). This pedometer does have a nice feature set as described in the product description, but I do not recommend this pedometer for the person trying to achieve their daily 10,000 steps. The only use I could recommend it for is to measure your workout on a sidewalk or road."
4,Omron Pedometer,"I find the Hj-112 digital premium pedometer easy to use and understand. This step counter not only counts regular and aerobic steps, but has a seven day memory system that allows me to compare and average my week's activity. The only difficulty that I've encountered was the one time I thought I had broken it because it got wet, but after a drying out period it was back in use. I would highly recommend it to others."
3,Don't count on the calorie feature,"I've purchased this pedometer due to price and reviews. I followed all the instructions in the booklet. I can only hope that it counts the steps correctly. If you are looking for this pedometer to give you an ""average"" calorie loss, then you can just forget it. For example, after an workout of high intensity for 30 minutes, it showed kcal 33, which is way far from any measurements out there (if you consider high intensity at 10 calories per minute). Run, walk, aerobic, have your pick, the calorie counter feature is useless. Other than that, I like it. It's easy to carry around, even when you have on a skirt. You can put it in your pocket too, and still secure it with the little clipper.I gave it 3 stars because of the calorie counter. If you want to count calories you're better off getting a heart rate monitor (do your research though, because there are so many out there - Acumen is a good one for beginers)."
3,"Needs a little improvement, but works great!","This product works great. It's not too sensitive but yet never misses a beat. However, the clip isn't too tight so it tends to fall off even though I have tried attaching it several different ways. Thanks goodness it has a great safety clip, so I haven't lost it."
5,ACCURATE!,"Best thing - it's extremely accurate, and that is really the most important thing when choosing a pedometer. It stores 7 days of walking info - calories burned, distance walked, steps taken, and time spent in aerobic stepping. Very smooth and attractive product. Easy set up and it stores your weight and stride too. The product is great and can be worn in multiple ways."
5,Omron HJ-112 Pedometer,"The Omron HJ-112 is awesome! It works as good as it looks! All the features work great and it is very simple to use! Stores a week's worth of walking - very cool! Though the clip works very good, the extra reassurance of the added safety clip is very nice and functional!"
5,Worth the money,"I've had other pedometers over the years, all costing less, none lasting long. This is durable, accurate, and easy to use. Can just be dropped in your pocket, doesn't need to be clipped on."
5,Pocket Pedometer,I am enjoying the digital pocket pedometer. It is very easy to use.Everything comes with the pedometer so that you can insert the batteryand you are ready to start walking. I would highly recommend this.
5,BEST pedometer for your money!,"I have owned several pedometers and this Omron HJ-112 is by far my favorite (I just bought a second one after my sister liked my last one so well that she kept it). It has all the features you could want and the price is really nice too. I previously owned the HJ-720ITC but did not use the computerized features enough to make the extra price worthwhile for me personally. Although it too was a great product and would probably work well for someone who wants to track their progress on the computer. All-in-all, I have turned several people on to this pedometer and all of us swear by it. Happy purchasing!"
5,Pedometer - worth your effort,"This product is easy to use, easy to set up and maintains well. This is my second Omron pedometer. The first one worked very well until the day I sent it through the wash with my blue jeans. I have used many other types of pedometers and find that this one is the most consistent in measuring steps, gives you the correct information when you need it."
4,It's great!,"I really like the pedometer because it's so convenient for me to just clip it to my belt, and by the end of the day I can see how many steps (or miles) I've gone. And it resets itself automatically at the end of the day."
1,Not what I expected,This pedometer was not accurate. I researched several before purchasing and based on all the reviews this seemed to be the one with the most accuracy. I am training for a 60 miles walk and wanted something to track my mileage. The mileage was so inaccurate I returned the item. I have not found an accurate one yet. The best way is to drive your route and track with your car odometer.
2,OK Item,"I purchased this item for my own use, but could never get it to work properly, so I gave it to someone else . I don't know if she figured out how to use it or not."
2,Save Your Money - Time Your Walks Instead!,My purchase of this pedometer was really emotional and I still regret it even though it's not that much money. It seems like an OK product but I can tell you that the technology is not that sophisticated and it's impractical to carry around with you every day. It looks like a pager when you wear a suit and the clasp doesn't hold even the thinnest belt that good. I'm not going to go on and on like other reviewers but I suggest you buy a stopwatch and time your walks...this way you can use your watch or carry a timer in your pocket. P.S. I cared so much for this little device that I haven't been able to find this device after the first week of use.
1,Lost within a week...,"This pedometer's functions were awesome....while they lasted. Unfortunately the beltclip wasn't as well made and within 5 days of using the pedometer, it fell off my pants and was lost forever. If you're planning to use the pedometer at your waist and don't want to flush $30 down the drain, this might not be the pedometer for you."
3,Hard to use,"This item was annoyingly hard to get to work properly. When it did work that is. A few times, after stopping the pedometer, I later noticed that it was still on. I wouldn't purchase this one again."
3,Bulky and weird aerobic setting,"I'm used to the small rectangulars that I would wear at work to track steps all day. This one is bigger than my cell phone and has this weird cord to keep it from falling off. It's fairly comfortable to wear, but everyone sees it and can read the numbers.Also has this mode called aerobic steps. Not sure what those are, since I've worn it while doing aerobics and step classes and running and it hasn't measured a single aerobic step in the past month I've had it.I personally don't think it's worth the money for what I use it for."
1,Poor - One star is too good for it!,"This pedometer defaults to 0 steps at midnight, and maintains records for 7 days. It is very difficult to program, and does NOT accurately measure steps. I am very dissatisfied with this product. It is now stored away in a drawer, since it is not cost-effective for me to return it to the manufacturer.I am sorry to submit such a negative response. My first OMRON pedometer was so very useful, I had expected a newer one to be at least that proficient. My old one is simply worn out.Thank you for the opportunity to 'sound off' about this new pedometer.B. Lindfors"
4,Pocket Pedometer,"It is a little larger than I was expecting and I easily knock it off, the extra clip has kept me from losing it."
5,makes exercise fun,The pedometer is small - fits in your pocket or on your belt. You can see at a glance how many steps - how many arobic steps - miles and calories you burn. Love that you can go back and see what you have done for the past week. Virtually indestructible. Also easy to set. Love this product.
5,Wonderful pedometer!,"I have had several cheaper pedometers, but am so glad I stepped up to this model. It is accurate and keeps track of my progress for several days in the memory. The only thing better would be to have a watch/timer feature! Highly recommended.Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer"
3,Good pedometer...Crazy price!!!,"I purchased this pedometer back in April. It was 18.99 then. What has happened in 7 months to warrant such a price jump? Looks like Omron is capitalizing on their Amazon success. I'm sure there are plenty of other good pedometers out there to choose from. It's a good pedometer, no doubt, but 39.99!!???"
3,"Great pedometer, very poor holster....","This is a real shame, it is a great pedometer but then they put it in a poorly designed holster that keeps falling off your belt or edge of garment. A weak spring clip makes this pretty much useless."
1,Doesn't work,"I ordered a pedometer that was a notch above the cheapest model and even researched the makes and models so that I would get an accurate one. Nope! This thing registers 40-50 extra steps every 100 steps. So, when I wear it (not much anymore!), I have to count all my steps anyway. I tried resetting it, changing where I wear it - nothing works. Blah!"
2,DOESN'T COUNT ALL STEPS,"When wearing this with my older pedometer, I find that it doesn't count all of my steps. In the manual it says that the unit will not change until you have walked more than 4 seconds. That means that walking across a small room doesn't count to this pedometer. As I sit here my Omron says that I've walked 5557 steps and my older pedometer says I've walked 7530 steps. Not sure the reasoning for that, but Omron is shorting me on my steps! Also, it falls off of a waistband when clipped to it in the belt clip most times that I bend down. I'd return this if I hadn't already thrown out the packaging, don't waste your money on a pedometer that won't register all of your hard earned steps!"
4,Omron HR-100C,"This is an okay product. Its easy to use, comfortable and has multi uses. The only problem I've had is that the stop watch reset button is hard to locate."
1,2009 model,I wasn't able to program this unit. Called Omron and they decided something was wrong with the unit and to return it.Omron said this was a 2009 model.
2,open item?????,"It came with other items. This thing was bubblewrapped, no box of any sort. It was suppose to be a gift. Nope, not happy with the condition of the packaging."
4,Meets Expectations,"The product is simple to use and set up. It tracks data for up to a week. You do have to measure and set an average stride length to get the distance to work. The more accurate this is, the more accurate the overall distance will be. I found it to work in most conditions. If you store it in you pocket, the mode button has a tendency to get bumped, changing the display mode."
5,Love it!,"I have had several cheapy pedometers that were okay but this one works so much better! I am a consumer reports 'junkie' and this is the one that they recommended. My whole work group is wearing them and we are having a walking competition. I love that you can put it in your pocket too, it can be unconfortable sometimes on the waistband. The extra features are great: aerobic steps and the memory. I will continue walking a bit further than I needed to so that I can register aerobic steps! Overall, well worth the money."
2,Not the product I was Looking for,"Well first of all I got this pedometer hoping that it would help me calculating the distance I run , but unfortunately its more useful or maybe it has been made for walking. It does not count very well when I run with it , but its quite accurate when I walk.This was not the product I was looking for , and a bit disappointed it. One more thing I noticed is , the manual said it switches off after a 5 min delay ( if you do not press any buttons ) , but mine does not !! I guess it has a defect , and did not want to pay more shipping to get it back to the Company."
4,Satisfied,"Speedy delivery. Simple to use. Does all I was looking for in a pedometer. A bit big to be a ""pocket"" pedometer; would love it to be smaller."
1,Great pedometer terrible accessories,"I've had two of these - the first was replaced after some months of use, when first the belt clip/holder broke, shortly followed by the clip on the lanyard - the pedometer itself is still functional though. The second one lasted less than a weekend - the new version of the belt clip doesn't hold securely enough and I lost my new pedometer on the second day of wearing it.It's a shame that such a good product is let down by the accesories. Unfortunately my experiences have put me off replacing it once more."
4,pretty good,"I would give this a 5 but I am disappointed that it doesn't actually track all my steps! I like to know how many actual steps I take in a day and this device only starts measuring after 4 seconds. I had a cheapo pedo from target's $1 section that tracked every step and when I wore them both together this one would be off by over 3,000 steps a day!I like that it stores your info for 7 days and that it measures miles, aerobic steps and calories. Good for the money."
1,Not good so far,My daughter set it up for me to track my steps. I haven't been able to make it work yet. Have owed it for about 3 weeks or so and haven't tracked anything. Not too happy. Who should I contact to get more directions??
5,"Finally, an accurate pedometer!","After spending way too much money on countless inaccurate pedometers (6-8?) I ""risked"" upping the money & ordered this.Now I don't leave home without it.Training to walk a 3-Day (60 mile) it has become my new body attachment. 7 day history, ease of use. Set up instructions were easy. I love the clip & tether.The Omron product is amazing. Now, I'm going to buy one with Stopwatch action. NOTE: This particular model is NOT a heart rate monitor as ""tagged"".Great. 5+ stars!"
5,Pedometer,"I love it! It resets itseld daily, gives me the calorie used, mileage, steps and even aerobic steps for any particular day."
4,waking pedom,This product works good because it tells you how many steps you are taking while you are walking
4,Very good pedometer,"TheOmron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometeris very accurate. I especially like the secondary clip, which is definitely a plus in case the primary clip slips off which occasionally it does. Luckily because I always attach both, my pedometer has not inadvertently slipped off during my walk. This has occurred with other pedometers that I have owned without this feature. The only feature I wish it had was a date on the display face."
5,Accurate pedometer,"I don't claim to know much about pedometers, but this one has been the only reliable one out of 4 that I've owned. It was easy to set up/program, it tracks 7 days' history, and I've found it to do everything it says it does. If you need something accurate without a lot of bells and whistles, I recommend this pedometer. It was well worth the price."
4,Reliable product,"This is my second Omron Pedometer bought in 2008. I have not only used it myself but have liked it enough to gift it to a friend, and have recommended it to others.Simple, straightforward to use, reliable and consistent.The only drawback is for people like me who like to walk and run. Because the calculation of the distance is based on number of steps, if the step is any shorter or longer, it does not really compensate for that. Once you've setup step length - thats the basis of calculation.2 step settings would have helped!"
2,Not liked it,"I just bought it but it is not calculating steps sometime and also it is very hard to know how many calories burned, it shows in kcal that doesn't tell exactly how many calories burned.Also, it must be perpendicular to ground, if it is less than 60' and more than 120'(degrees) it will not calculate steps."
5,Very Good,I only had this for a month because it fell off my side pants. It worked great but I will not spend money for another one.
2,Read the instructions,"The product looks well made but it has been confusing how to program the pedometer so have not been able to use yet. The instructions give you one sentence. If you don't understand there is no where else to go. I also bought one as a gift and they too have not figured out how to program. There is no on/off button so once you install the battery it's on for it's life, unless you want to unscrew the back and remove it."
2,Clip on the back of the Pedometer,The plastic clip on the back of the Pedometer broke off the first time we used it.The Pedometer worked fine...just the clip was bad.
4,Omron HJ-112Pedometer,"I'm very pleased with the Omrom HJ-112. It appears to be very accurate, it offers options in addition to clipping it to your belt or waistband, and it tracks the time you are walking at an aerobic speed. Seems well made and a quality product. If it were slightly smaller so it wouldn't be so conspicuous if you wanted to wear it with street clothes, I'd give it 5 stars without any hesitation."
1,broke after less than a month,"I was very pleased with this for the whole 3.5 weeks that it worked. Suddenly it began adding steps with the slightest movement- if I had it in my hand or in a bag and moved either across the table, 8-10 steps would be added. Maybe I got a defective one but reading the reviews about the customer service, I am not going to put in the time to find out or spend the money to get another one."
1,A packaging nightmare,"Product arrived in a padded Amazon box, inside of which was a plastic bubble pack, that stiff kind you need a hacksaw to open. Inside of that was a stiff pasteboard box and inside of that was more plastic protection. Inside of that the product was well protected, but since the package had to be ripped to shreds to open, pieces went flying. I fianlly found the strap on the floor. I never did find the battery. I'm not sure there was one, though the manual says it's included. I even opened the battery slot(which requires a tiny phillips head srewdriver NOT included to see if maybe it was already installed. It wasn't. I would return this piece of junk but the Amazon policy says ""return in original packaging, wich no longer exists. I don't know it the product works well or not. I won't until I go out and buy a battery. Which I may do. . . or I may just throw it against the wall and write off the twnety bucks."
2,Not what I need,May be fine for measuring planned walks but is definitely not for keeping track of your daily totals. Cannot be turned off and will reset to zero for no apparent reason.
3,pedometer,My adult son helped me set up the pedometer. I carry it with me all day. Today I will take it with me on my 3 mile walk After using this pedometer for 1 month it stopped working.
5,Finally! Exactly what I was looking for!,"I've tried cheap pedometers - I've tried the JawBone Up, I've tried the FitBit, I've tried the Weight Watchers pedometer and FINALLLLLY I found one that I like. Almost felt like Goldilocks and the three bears - this one was too sensitive, this one was too small, etc.I am amazed that it knows the difference between when I am walking for exercise (aerobic mode it says) and regular walking. I'm a big believer in technology to make us more aware of health and healthy choices. The first day I wore it I logged 10592 steps--not bad at all. And of those - it logged 3022 as aerobic which was my AM walk.I am impressed with how easy it was to set up- the ONLY complaint is the clip is pretty flimsy--I would like to see it grip a bit tighter but it's not a deal breaker by any stretch.I would HIGHLY recommend this pedometer to anyone looking for that spark for New Years resolutions."
3,"Good pedometer, poor clip fastener","This pedometer works well and appears to be accurate. Unfortunately, the plastic clip that clips to a pocket or belt has a tendency to break after about a month (it happened to both pedometers I bought), and it is very weak. In addition, the bracket holding the pedometer itself broke on one of the two pedometers within 3 months, so be prepared to carry the pedometer in your pocket, at which point it is inconsistent in measuring your steps.I do not see any clips or fasteners for sale that might remedy this situation. If you have spare metal clips from business conferences, you might be able to fasten this to the pedometer. Otherwise, be prepared to buy a new Omron pedometer every few months, or else buy another pedometer."
4,Great except for the clip,"After seeing nice reviews on Amazon, I picked up the Omron pedometer cheap online. Overall I am impressed with the accuracy, convenience, and features (memory for one). But I have had trouble with the clip and finding a good spot to put it.I spent 4 days trying different spots on my pockets, waistband, belt, jacket, etc... Unfortunately the places that kept it upright best (waist) also caused it to fall off any time I sat down. Annoying until I looked down one day and didn't see it clipped on anymore... and had no idea where it could have fallen off. Sigh. I guess using the safety strap would be a good idea (even though the booklet didn't seem to warn about this adequately).Omron was awesome enough to ship a one time courtesy replacement (awesome company!). So with the new device I always have it harnessed in!"
4,"The best value in pedometers, but holder is cheaply made","This pedometer is about as accurate as you could reasonably expect. The features are suitable and it even looks good.The only problem I have with this product is minor, and it's why I gave the item 4 stars, rather than 5. The plastic holder/belt clip that comes with the pedometer is cheaply made and has a very puny little spring.If you don't plan on using the belt clip, this is definitely a 5 star item. Otherwise, just treat the holder gently and hopefully it will last longer than mine did, because Omron won't sell the holder seperately.The holder is the only weakness to speak of and if Omron redesigns it, this will be 5 stars across the board (For the record,I wouldn't let my opinion of the holder stop me from buying another one. I'd make the same suggestion to anyone who's on the fence - buy it.)"
5,motivational tool,This product is compact and packs a punch that deliversand helps making walking/trekking fun.
2,No Battery Included,"Well, I ordered this item as a throw in with the heart monitor. It's been over 30 days since I ordered it and finally remembered to bring it with me to work so I can count my steps. No where is there a battery in this thing even though the package clearly states there should be one. Called Omron and got a sorry we don't have those batteries to ship out so you can send it to us for repair along with $5 and you pay for shipping as well. Called Amazon and they at least credited me $4 (10% of my order amount)towards a battery. After 30 days there is no full refund or exchange. So, this may be a nice pedometer but the company who makes it sure doesn't have good service, so I recommend you open your package asap to make sure everything is included."
3,Omron pedometer,"This product works well. Unfortunately if you mess up when programming it, you cannot fix it."
1,Omron,"I have used Omron pedometers for years and this one was horrible. It was so tall that when it was fastened to my waistband it would poke my ribs when I bent over or moved, as did the safety harness clasp. It wouldn't acurately keep track of my steps if I used it in my pocket or on my waist."
2,Maybe I got an older model....,"But this pedometer does not deserve all the rave reviews it gets here. I bought this particular model because it wasn't too pricey and it got great reviews. I found out that it doesn't accurately count the footsteps. I wear it in my pocket and sometimes when I take it out, it will jump 10-20 steps. I have to handle it very carefully. I use this for it's ""ballpark"" accuracy. As in it will give you a ""ballpark number"" of steps you have walked."
2,Not secure enough.,I purchased this and wore it one day it was fine. The next day I wore it to school since I work there and lost it within an hour of being in school. The strap clip did not open for me. The clip is not sturdy enough and it popped off my waist 5x. That should have told me something. The product itself is great but they should have a more secure way of keeping in connected to your body. How it does long range is anyones guess!
4,Better than the others I've tried,"This product is easy to use and set up. The clock keeps perfect time, and you can put it almost anywhere. The only thing that's a bit funky is the accessory clip. It does not open easily."
5,I love it!,This is a great product. Seems to be very accurate. I like that you can look back over the last 7 days to see how you have done and the clip has kept it from falling many times. I would highly recommend it.
5,Pedometer,"nice little pedometer for the price, very accurate but somehow diffcult to program. Have to get the kids to reprogram when time changes weight changes"
5,Accurate and easy to use,"I purchased this product based on previous reviews. I must agree that the product is very accurate and easy to use. I enjoy the different modes (for mileage, steps, and aerobic walking time)."
1,Very disappointed - too bulky and don't stay clipped on.,"I bought this pedometer because it was rated high on most websites. I was dissappointed almost immediately when I receive the pedometer and saw how thick and bulky it is. It sticks out like a sore thumb under my clothes as I'd like to wear it around my waist all day to keep track of my activities. The pedometer cannot stay clipped on and keep on falling off if I do anything that is semi active. Overall, I thought the design of the pedometer, considered how thick it is, is not well thought out and downright awkward. It is so uncomfortable to wear and such a nuisance to use that it just sits collecting dirt now."
5,"Not waterproof, but...","I use this pedometer every day. I walk around a lot at work, so it's interesting to see how far one really can walk in a day. It's easy to use too; set your pace, put it in your pocket, and it does the rest.Last week I inadvertently left the unit in my pocket when I did laundry. The unit went through the wash and the drier. Between the water, the heat, and being tumbled around for an hour, I thought for sure it was history. I figured I didn't have anything to loose by disassembling it and letting it dry, so I did. A day or two later I put it all back together, popped the battery in (the same one, not a new one), and wouldn't you know it, it worked! It's been a week or two now, and it's still going strong! Remarkable!Now, I wouldn't recommend intentionally getting the unit wet, but it's nice to know it can survive it."
3,omron hj112 pedometer,"Not as useful for hiking, it resets every day but I don't care how many miles I walked during the entire day, just those for a particular hike. We have another omron pedometer with a reset button on the front. So far that is a good unit for hiking, buy that one instead of the Hj112"
3,Small size is advantage,"However, there is no clock and the directions need to be improved. Alot of guessing as to how to make it work."
5,Love it,"I like to walk at least 10,000 steps per day and HJ-112 helps me to keep track. It's very easy to use and set up. It not only tells me how many steps I take but also miles, calories burned,aerobic calories, and will hold information for one week. I hardly know I have it on. Like all pedometers, it is not foolproof and when jiggled, will count steps but it gives me a very good idea of what I'm doing per day. It is also good for plotting out new walking courses. I love it wear every day."
4,favorite toy,"This is my favorite toy. I use it nearly everyday, trying to get my 10k steps in. I wish it measured all the hills I have to climb on my walks, but never mind. My only gripe is I do not think it measures distance accurately. When I drive my car to measure the distances, they invariably add up to more. I have repeated the experiment several times. But the number of steps is more important than the distance. Last night I found my dog had chewed up my pedometer so I'll be ordering another. Good price, good design, a real motivator if you compete with yourself, regardless of my doubts about mileage accuracy."
5,GREAT MOTIVATIONAL ITEM,"HAVE USED THIS ITEM FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS, SO FAR SO GOOD. IT HAS DONE EVERYTHING IT SAYS IT WILL DO. IT TOOK A FEW MINUTES TO SET UP AND IT IS WORKING FINE. IF YOU NEED SOMETHING TO GET YOU OFF THE COUCH AND START WALKING THIS MAY BE THE TICKET."
5,A Great Buy!,I just love it. I want to thank everyone who reviewed it before I purchased. You were all very helpful!!!
4,Count Your Steps,"This Omron pedometer was recommended in a Kiplinger article. It meets the hype. You can drop it in your pocket rather than fasten to a belt, and it takes a reading no matter what the position. To date I only use it for steps, and I have yet to make the goal of 10,000 steps even walking the dog.Another great feature is that the pedometer automatically resets each day. Of course, you can archive past achievements.The only bad feature was the packaging. You need the strength of Goliath to open the shrink wrap. I even have a special tool for shrink wraps and grunted away in my efforts to take out the pedometer. Also the serial number is not on the back. I found out from the manufacturer that it appears on the inside of the cover. Difficult to register with the serial number if you don't know how to find it. Oh well, life's little complications."
4,Where's the battery?,"I purchased this item after it was recommended to me by a friend. I am very happy with the pedometer itself, it is easy to use and it does help me to be more aware of my activity level throughout the day. I do think that helps you to ""kick it up a notch"" if you've had a sedentary day. However, the information said ""battery included"" and there was no battery. I was so eager to get started with it that the inconvenience, and the additional $6 expense was disappointing. Perhaps better quality control is in order?"
3,how to use with Mac?,Love the ped. but have a mac and your product is for a PC. Have written your company for help and got no response.
4,Omron HJ112 Pocket Pedometer,"Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket PedometerThis pedometer lives up to all the on line reviews. It is not the most complex one you can buy, but it may be the most accurate.It is extremely easy to use. Just throw it in your pocket and forget it until you want to see your results.My wife liked it so much I have one on order for her.Tks David"
5,Fantastic,"The first week after I received this product, by mistake, I left it in my jeans and tossed it into the washing machine for about five minutes, before I discovered my mistake. I rushed to pull it out... hung it up to dry -- although I could see water in the face of the Pedometer. The next day I noticed the clock was still working, so took it with me on my morning walk. Yippppeeee! I still works and has been working faithfully ever since.It is so light weight, I don't even notice it.THANK YOU!"
4,"Best things, worst thing","Best things:- It will track whether it's in your pocket, purse or clipped to your belt, unlike pedometers with a pedulum that must be vertical.- It's accurate, at least far more so than nearly all other brands.Bad thing:- It tracks only time that it deems to be ""aerobic,"" not total time. So if your goal is to walk 30 minutes, you'd better be speed walking or keeping up a pretty fast pace every minute or you need a different way to track that. Pretty weak not to have that very common feature. If you're out of shape, slower paces might still be aerobic for you, but this gizmo doesn't ""think"" that way."
3,Does the job but a clunky size,"I ordered two of these for friends at work who walk with me at lunchtime. I own the Ozeri multi-directional pedometer, but my friends needed a pedometer that could clip to their clothing. This one works great and is accurate, but it is big/clunky and shows under clothing. I like my Ozeri SO MUCH better. The brand new generation of Ozeri 4X3 ""Razor"" now comes with an extra battery, a clip and a leash, and it is smaller and lighter (I should have waited a week to order them - sorry, friends!) Get the Ozeri!"
2,Not reliable,I loved this pedometer for the first 60 days or so...then it just stopped registering steps. very disappointed in quality of product.
2,Disappointed,"This is a very good and accurate device. Unfortunately, it has a major shortcoming - it can not be reset for multiple walks on the same day. It only resets by itself at midnight each day. I contacted Omron directly to ask if there was any way to reset it and was told that there was not. If you desire one reset per day, then this is your unit. That's why I rated it only two stars."
2,not metric,Hi I like the service but unfortunatly I had to return the item as it was not a metric one and I am living in Australia
5,Count your steps easily,"I LOVE this pedometer! I bought one for my husband last month and he puts it on as soon as he gets out of bed and wears it all day. I was motivated by his enthusiasm and got one for myself. It really makes me aware of days when I need to move a little more to make up for too much sitting around. I aim for 10,000 steps a day and usually make my goal. It is easy to program and attach to your pocket or waistband/belt."
5,Love it!,"The easiest-to-use, easiest-to-read pedometer I've ever tried. Just stick it in your pocket and it records all your steps, even identifying which steps were aerobic and calculating your aerobic time. A great way to track your progress toward getting those 10,000+ steps every day! It also records your daily miles and calories burned and an especially nice added bonus is the memory feature -- a good way to see how well (or not!) you've done during the previous seven days.Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer"
5,Motivates,"This pedometer will keep you motivated to continue to strive for 10,000 steps and more. Having the accurate time on it also is beneficial. No need to wear a wrist watch.This is my second pedometer. Previous one was not accurate at all. Very difficult to monitor steps walked. This monitor resets itself at midnight to be ready for the next days walk. Very nice."
4,I love it!,Very easy to use. A little bulky but I seem to manage to wear it everyday inconspicuously.
5,Simply the best.,"After breaking a few pedometers when they fell off and having pedometers count steps when I was sitting in a vehicle, I had made up my mind that I was purchasing my LAST pedometer. I was prepared to pay whatever it took to get both accuracy and longevity. After reading the reviews, and seeing the cost of this pedometer, ordering it, and having worn it for a month, I am convinced that this is the best choice out there. The low profile allows you to wear this under a shirt with very little bulk, the safety strap/clip allow you to protect the unit from falling, and the easy key structure allows you to use the funcations without reading the manual. Great product!"
1,Doesn't work,"There were no problems with set up, but once I was ready to use it, it won't record my steps. I've tried attaching it different ways, putting it in my pocket, putting it in my bag, but it only records about one out of every 50 steps (right now it says 12 after I've been walking all over the place). I can't believe that it comes with a manual that's several pages long, with how to set it up, change the battery, attach it, etc., but NOT how to make the thing work. Terrible product!"
4,Good price. Does the job. Simple to use.,"This is my first time with a pedometer. It is a reasonable price and it appears to be near accurate when measured against a distance with known mileage. It measures your steps when worn on various locations on your body. Make sure you attach a safety strap as it can fall off a waist band. It is easy to use- no more bells and whistles than one really needs. This brand was recommended on a ""10,000 steps"" walking and weight loss facebook page. Having no prior experience, I took the recommendation and have no regrets."
5,no complaints with this pedometer,"This pedometer is great! Like the other many reviews here it is indeed the gold standard. And it cannot fall off the clip because it now includes a tether with a clamp grip. Easy to set up and use. I won't even say the negative about the screw for the battery as long as it lasts the 6 mos advertised. It arrived quickly and was well packaged. The booklet was very easy to use to set up the pedometer and it is easy to change parameters, ie weight. I went over my 10,000 steps the first day and will keep on using it for my daily exercise for, hopefully, a long time."
5,"More ""generous"" in counting steps","I had an earlier version of this pedometer, and loved it. When it went lost, I bought the HJ-112. Then I found the other one (also an HJ-112, but it had 4 buttons instead of three) and began carrying both in my pockets for a few days. The newer model seemed to count the same number of steps when I was out for a long walk, but it counted MORE steps when I was just ambling around the house. I suspect the newer model is doing a better job of counting actual steps, even if they don't burn as many calories as steps taken as part of a concerted walk."
4,Suited It's Purpose,"When used to track normal steps this is pretty accurate. I like that you can put it in your pocket or drop it in your purse and it will still keep tracking. Without the clip it is pretty slender but with the clip you will have twice the bulk. I use the strap whenever I carry it because I have dropped it a few times. My only complaint is that it does not calculate the distance correctly for aerobic steps. It only asks you for the length of a normal step when setting up your gait so there is no way it will calculate your running gait correctly. I suggest that if you are using it more for running then input your running gait and if you are using it mainly for just strait steps then your normal walking gait will suffice. I must say - since I purchased this, I have the need to always 1 Up myself in daily steps. A little motivation goes a long way!"
5,getting in shape,"The many functions this unit will perform include a 7 day memory for steps (aerobic and non aerobic) ,caloriesand miles for such a reasonable price is amazing. Also it is a great convenience that it will work in most anyposition making possible to carry it in your pocket or purse. I consider the Omron pedometer an excellent product which can help motivate you as part of an excercise program."
5,Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer,"I read the reviews before buying this product. This pedometer is hailed as one of the most accurate pedometers of it's kind and it sells at price that anyone can afford, I paid $20some odd dollars each for 2 of these pedometers. They have been banged up and dropped many times and still work flawlessly. A great pedometer for the price!"
2,Has Flaws,"There is no way to ""Start"" and ""Stop"" or ""reset"" this device... You cannot erase the information unless you do a system restore in which you are forced to re-input your weight , stride distance , time , date , etc. etc.For Example : I want to walk around the block when I get home from work... Im curious about the distance traveled around the block from point A to point B... Unless you notate the existing distance already on the device there is no way to know how far you walked.. This device will not allow you to ""set at zero"" unless you do the aformentioned ""system restore"" which is a pain in the neck.. We should simply be able to press a button to reset distance at ""zero"".. Also there is no way to shut this device off.. It stays on and continually counts until the battery dies.."
3,Meets expectations,"The pedometer does what it is designed to do...keep track of your steps for the day (and for the past 7 days) which is why I bought it. It comes with a lanyard to keep from losing it and it works well! Set it up to match your stride and it converts steps to miles, etc. The only part I am concerned about is durability...the little piece that plugs the top came off in the first week never to be seen again! Hasn't effected the operation whatsoever but am concerned about dirt and water getting in and the day it ups and stops! I am outdoors most of the time so time will tell. It's a good piece for the price."
1,Missing components,"This item came without parts that are listed for inclusion. Specifically, a strap and a battery. What is my option here besides return? Does the company replace these missing items?"
4,Well Worth $$$,"I've been very pleased with this pedometer. I had a cheaper one and this one beats it hands down! This was recommended to me by a friend and she loves hers also. Was a little skeptical spending more $$ on this one, but it was well worth it. Love all the features! Clip doesn't always stay on the greatest, but I use the safety strap w/it and haven't dropped it yet - would probably have lost it though had I not used the strap. Good motivation! Seems to be very accurate (not perfect, but way better than I had before - almost right on the dot)! Ended up buying one for my daughter and mother too! (They love theirs too!)"
3,Omron Pedometer Review,"The pedometer is very accurate if one plans only to walk and stay walking. It only picks up after 4 seconds of movement, so start and stop motion(as in shopping, or other everyday activity) will not register as steps taken. I have another (different) pedometer that does register movement, and I find myself wearing the Omron only when I plan walking, or doing my aerobic routine. Recently, it has not been kicking in until well after the 10 minutes of aerobic pace( maybe the battery is wearing down). It is a nicely designed unit; the holder and the lanyard are wonderful( I have lost pedometers because they lack securing devices). The memory feature is nice to keep track of history."
5,Omron HJ-112 Pedometer,"I love my Omron Pedometer. It is very accurate and it has a strap in case it moves from your waist. I give it 5 stars. It keeps up to 7 days of steps, calories, and aerobic steps in case you are walking on a treadmill. I would certainly recommend it.Wanda"
3,every little step,This is the second purchase of the pedometer. I gave it as a gift and have gotten very positive feedback from the recipient.I like that is goes back to zero at the end of the day and that it records aerobic and nonaerobic steps.
3,BAD CLIPS,"I had identical experience with other reviewers. On my 4th day of use, It disappeared while clipped to my belt and the tether clipped to my jeans pocket ! It did function properly and setup was easy."
1,Il Troppo Grosso & Vile,"Given the brilliant baritone Bryn Terfel stars in this FALSTAFF, I found that the only attractive aspect of this performance. The sets and costumes are overly stylistic and rather surreal, and all rather disgusting, with lollipop trees, rolling hills and the first scene of the second act, with food spilled all over Falstaff's table is really gross. Even Terfel cannot escape the muck. There's a scene where he's wearing a diaper in an incredibly disgusting bodysuit.I owned the video for a few months and ended up selling it. Unless you must see Terfel in the title role, buy it, but I'll wait until a later effort comes along in a better production.Honestly, this was one of the most awful productions I've ever seen."
4,"The second, difficult, album","With Wha'ppen, the Beat get socially conscious with almost all the songs -- see ""Dream Home in NZ,"" ""Get a Job"" and ""I am Your Flag"" for proof. Along with this lyrical change, they go to reggae's roots and further away from the Two Tone ska scene they never really fit in with in the first place.All three Beat albums are different, but this is the oddest of the three. A lot of great stuff to be found, for sure (""Drowning"" is a favorite of Michael Stipe's), but the least satisfying of the catalog, though definitely worth owning. ""Walk Away"" is a great beakup song.Let's hope London re-issues the UK-only b.p.m. comp that featured a bonus-discs worth of 12"" versions, including ""March of the Swivelheads,"" which was featured in Ferris Beuller's Day Off."
5,Fantastic Album,"The Beat's third and final album, ""Special Beat Service"", is one of the greatest rock / ska albums ever recorded. This second album is nearly as good. It just never gets old. It sounds as fresh today as it did over twenty years ago."
5,Fine Introduction to Behavioral Neurology/Neuropsychology,"Directed to a professional audience, this fine introduction to Behavioral Neurology and Neuropsychology is also accessible to the intelligent layperson. Dr. Rizzo, who is a pioneer in the emerging field of Neuroergonomics, and Dr. Eslinger present a clear and coherent picture of the current issues and topics in the field.This is a valuable addition to the library of psychiatrists and psychologists, as well as neurologists."
4,"We love these, just wish there were more letters","My daughters love playing with all of these different bath sticker/foamies. The only issue I have with this set is there is only one of each letter and it would have been great if they did 2 of some of the more common ones...we can't spell much with them, which was one of the reasons I bought them. Overall, they still have fun."
3,This is okay,"This will be fun for the kids, I did not like the fact the first time we used it it left yucky residue all over the bathtub."
3,Better if...,The pieces were larger or round with letter in a circle. Would like larger pieces. Otherwise we like the idea and we like the letter theme. We think it is cute.
4,Small but cute,The letters are smaller then I thought they would be but they are still cute and serve their purpose in the tub
5,READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!,"This book made me cry so many times... It's just SO SAD!!!! You have to read it!!!! It's a very tragic, but very eloquently told tale. I've also read ""One Last Drink"" in Realms of Valor, ""The Quiet Place"" in Realms of Magic, and the one whose name escapes me in Realms of Infamy. They are all excellent!!!!!! Jander is a very believable character and I simply loved this book. On my list of the best 3 books of all time I've read. = )"
3,"not bad,but could have been better","this was golden's first novel and it shows.jander was a neat concept,the gold elf who worships the sun turned into a vampire against his will.golden nailed jander's character but missed out on strahd,however to her credit there was once where she hit it dead on...when the morning lord priest is convinced that jander is his god and strahd says:""let the elf alone fool."" i nearly wet my pants laughing. that was pure strahd. i'm sure golden's skills will grow with experience.i'll have to read her again before i can elaborate further on her talent."
4,This is a wonderful horror filled romantic tragedy.,"Jandar Sunstar, his name says it all. Bright, shining and uncorruptable and, yes, a vampire. Count Strahd Von Zarovich evil incarnate with one weakness. Two vampires weaved together in an evil web of romance and obsession for one woman, Tatyana. Christie Golden, the author, has an uncanny way of bringing a feeling of tragic romance into the cold, hard world of Ravenloft. The language is exquisite and the story blends so well together that the book is impossible to put down. The story leads you down a road of suspence and watching and waiting. But, you soon learn to never ""hope"" in the realm of Ravenloft because though evil can never prevail, nor can good ever hope to overcome."
3,Not the best Ravenloft book,"Somehow Jander didn't feel that elven to me. For one thing why the hell did he worship Lathander? Jander comes from Evermeet where the elven pantheon reigns supreme.He should be worshipping Sehanine or Corellon! Still at some points the book was well written but the ending too lame.I had hoped there would be some swordplay between two great warriors but sadly it never happened. In my opinion Knight of the black rose is still the best Ravenloft novel, but then Lord Soth is also the meanest badguy standing on two feets!"
5,A GREAT CHRISTIE GOLDEN MASTERPIECE!!!,"This was the very first Ravenloft book I read. Christie Golden gives her characters such vivid descriptions and unforgetable personalities. Jander Sunstar is one of my favorite heroes! She also wrote some short stories about him in some of the Forgotten Realm books: Realm of infamy, Realm of Magic, etc. Strahd is wickedly cool! Anne Rice eat your heart out!"
5,A Must Read for Vampire Fans,"Science fiction has never held any great interest with me until I found the Ravenloft series. Being a Horror fan, specifically vampire fiction, it is not often I wander into the Sci-Fi section looking for a good read. Then I found this book. Jander Sunstar captures your attention and alerts your compassion like no other character has before. I have read over two hundred vampire novels, and this by far is my favorite. The magic of the tale draws you in and keeps you reading well into the night. The antagonist-protagonist relationship between Jander and Straud is incredibly well-matched, with even the villian (per se) having a well of expositional emotions to draw on. A reccommended read for an escape from reality."
2,"Dark, depressing, and disappointing","I became enchanted with Jandar's character after reading the two short stories about him in ""Realms of Valor"" and ""Realms of Infamy."" I must have re-read each at least five times, and when I found out that there was an entire _novel_ I was ecstatic. However, I found the book to be far, far below my expectations. Though Jandar remains a wonderful character, he is made worthless by the Ravenloft setting. How (forgive me) stupid, to put such a character into a dismal world with no escape but death. Maybe the author was going for the Drizzt Do'Urden ""noble tragedy"" thing, but what she forgot was the part where the noble protagonist actually _improves_ their situation, or is rewarded for their actions. Save tragedy for Shakespeare--I like my fantasy uplifting."
1,Trash! Complete and utter trash.,"I made the terrible mistake of purchasing this book in the airport. Of a small collection of books, this one seemed interesting. I regret my decision.Vampire of the mists is terribly written. Even a layman could surpass the mediocre literate skills of Christie Golden. The only reason why they can sell #### like this is because of all those mind-numbing, spirit-crushing AD&D players out there. It's a pity they allow people to publish stuff like this."
3,D & D Campaign novel,"With the Ravenloft campaign by now defunct TSR, bought out in this reprint by Wizards of the Coast, D & D land tries to create a dark and brooding gothic atmosphere. I've seen better stuff in Anne Rice and Cradle of Filth, though it is a lot better than fat butt Acheron. A mediocre attempt at bringing more romanticized gothic fashion to D & D, and I picked it as my campaign."
5,The Ending Nearly Broke my Heart...,"I hunted this book down after reading the Jandar short stories in the ""Infamy"" series. Ms. Golden writes far better than many of the supposed veteran writers I've run across. She does an excellant job of developing all of the characters, not just Jandar. She builds the story very slowly, allowing pieces of the mystery to fall into place and keep drawing us along. While the villian is obvious, just what his crime was, and how horribly it's twisted the lives (and unlives) of the cast isn't learned until close to the story's end. And the last few pages are real tear jerkers. I really like the Drizzt books, but I never have been as emotionally attached to Mr. Salvator's noble dark elf as I am to Ms. Goldens' tragic sun elf."
1,Cucina Pro Electric Folding Slicer #1710,"Cucina, product manufacturer, has made two (2) slicers with the same product number, pictured is the old model. Without a photo accompanying a review, one does not know which product is being evaluated.Cucina has discontinued the pictured slicer and given the same product number to a new model. Product #1710."
1,What Is Rother Doing??,"I can't believe how much of a steaming pile of turd this album is. Rother's tracks a la Hacker & Destroy Him My Robots blew me to pieces. Why has he jumped onto the electroclash bandwagon? The vocals are embarrassing, the music worse (boring, in fact). This is lazy - I think he's run out of ideas. I wonder if he actually listened to what he was recording. Cmon, Anthony - we know what you're capable of!!"
3,Just an o.k. purchase,"I bought these earrings for myself. When I got them, I was underwhelmed. Not much to them. Great purchase for a juvenile-too small for an adult."
2,Could be better,"The product does style the hair, but it doesn't hold the style long. Once the hold wears off it leaves a thick film on the hair that is hard to get out. The smell could use some definite improvement as well."
1,Good luck getting this item,"This company sent me a cheaper item with horrible reviews, am in the process of trying to get it returned. I am in a time crunch and will be updating this review to let everyone know if it is resolved right or not."
2,USB connection ONLY.,"While it does not mention it in the specs for this product, this mouse connects through the USB port. It does not connect through the PS/2 port. The listing for the contents on the box says IBM Travel Mouse, USB connector, User's Manual. This is not strictly true. The travel mouse only connects through the USB port and there is no seperate USB connector. The owner's manual contains a link for technical support, and very little else. However the web site for MicroInnovations does not admit to making or selling the Travel Mouse, so there is no technical support available online for this product. There is no driver for this mouse. So even with an adaptor, you cannot use the PS/2 port with this mouse. While I like the shape, size and color of this mouse, the connectivity problems give it a very poor rating."
4,VERY SATISFIED,This is the second time I have purchased this book. I bought it for my son and it was lost in a move. He was very happy with it and wanted the same book as a replacement. He did not take typing in school and is learning on his own so this is Ok for a beginner.
1,Keyboarding made Simple,I received the book with a damaged cover (detached about half of the front page)
5,Carbon Fiber Shift Knob,"This is the third knob I bought. Love the weight, feel and quality. Have the same knob on all three of my cars and I love it!!!"
3,Only for kids who love Dora,"The cards are small and theres a lot of cards.You may only want to use half of them to start with,to many to remember for first timers."
5,Excellent Game,"Bought the Memory Dora game for my Granddaughter's 4th birthday. She plays this game all the time, and of course she wins! Everyone plays with her: Mom, Dad, Sister, Brother, Aunts, etc. It's a great gift for any age, and lots of fun for all."
1,Never got the right product,"I ordered this product for a gift and when it came there were a few of the correct cards in the box and bunch of other cards that were of posters and kittens. They sent no envelopes at all. So I sent it back for an exchange and when I got the new box it had exactly the same problem. Not sure if they read the return information or if the packing process is all automated, but I just returned the 2nd shipment and told them to forget it."
3,didn't get much use,"Unfortunately, I don't really know if this book is a good book or not. My son went off to tech camp last year to learn how to make video games. He came back all excited about his new found skills and continued to make games at home,so I bought him this book for Christmas. I don't even think he did more than scan through it and decide it was just too busy to take the time to read (he is a male and it was instructions). I definitely think it would be geared for a much older crowd (he was a very advanced 12yr old). Sorry I can't be more helpful than that."
2,Bad Teacher,"I do not like the way the book is written (frankly). Maybe it's just me, but I like things explained better. I understand everything he is saying and he does give you a step by step list of how to do things, but he DOES NOT tell you the purpose of each of the features of .Mac, which to me is essential. It's almost as if he thinks we already understand what to do with each of the components of membership. He gives absolutely NO examples of what you'd use these things for and all he really would have had to do would've been include a couple paragraphs about it. As I read it's hard for me to follow along because he excludes essential information relevant to .Mac and the use thereof."
1,Buy any other horse book instead,"Very disappointing. If you know anything at all about the famous Thoroughbreds, this book will add nothing to your knowledge. It's written in the form of a dialogue with a fictional groom who seems to have seen every famous horse from Regret to Personal Ensign, and the information is just brief capsules summarizing their careers, and sometimes volunteering opinions based on no evidence given. For me, definitely a ""give to a local nonprofit book sale"" item. And the paintings... well, I've seen better pictures sent in by 10-year-olds to the Breyer magazine."
5,Loved the book,"Great book. Charming story and wonderful artwork. I can't recommend it enough. You feel like you're sitting in Louis' Restaurant, downtown Paris, Kentucky, listening to an old hardboot spin his tales."
3,Brain Candy for an airplane ride,"A good book for a trip on a airplane -- a low price and a quick, engrossing read, but.... you won't feel bad about leaving it behind at the hotel once you're done. That's a positive reveiew -- I look for books in this category when I'm traveling. It's an interesting story about how this remarkable artist develops her sketches. If you're looking for great literature, look elsewhere."
4,"Engrossing, Easy to Read True Crime Book","I've read plenty of true crime books but this is the first by a ""sketch artist"" and it was very educational, especially as to how her methods differ from most of the other artists. After reading this book, you'll raise an eyebrow anytime you see a sketch in your local paper."
5,Favorite book of the year,"Hello again from our book club. Yes, we have decided to all submit reviews for Portraits of Guilt. After seeing it in Oprah, we decided to try this book about this unusual career to open our minds to different ways of life, but we found a woman who fights seemingly all alone, when others have been injured. So we want to speak out for her! She is a real inspiration. The book is well written, a pleasurable read and opens your eyes to what is really behind the walls of ""justice.:"
4,Extremely Interesting!! - Real Life stuff,I found this book to be really interesting. Made me want to think about becoming a Forensics specialist or a detective. Good Read
5,Portraits of Guilt,"Jeanne Boylan's ""Portraits of Guilt"" is a bold testimony to the victim's subconscious mind which often holds the prominent and obsure details in finding the true roadmap to justice.""Portaits of Guilt"" honors Polly Class with love and compassion and provides an inner healing to those devastated by the horrors of violence.Let the reader beware that this is a bold and gripping story. Jeanne Boylan is a professional who defies tradition in connecting with her victims. She raises the reader's awareness and provides insight to the victim or witness perspective. Her method and technique is the one which the investigative community should continue to seek early in the crime phase. I hope Jeanne Boylan continues to reach the ""system"" before another mistake occurs.I believe Boylan's story gives hope and support to the victim's or eyewitness' memory. It is her passion and integrity that prevails in solving so many of these horrific crimes of violence."
5,You MUST read this book!,"Every now and then, bad things happen to good people. Jeanne does everything she can to make sure that the victim does not feel more trauma--she has to ease them through the pain of what they have seen--but more importantly--she has to allow them to tell what they have seen so that authorities can get these monsters off the street. God has truly blessed us all to have put Jeanne on this planet with her talented insight. This book will grip you and I promise you you will not be able to put this book down."
5,I smell a TV series! It's good. Really good.,"Terrific book. Amazing, compassionate and courageous woman. I scout books for a film studio in LA and read nearly every biography that comes out. Most are essentially self aggrandizing, this one is definitely not. Instead, Boylan writes a tribute to the people she's worked with and fearlessly points out the frightening ineptness of police.But with that, she also serves up powerful suggestions for positive change. Effective, enlightening and blatently, a TV series waiting to happen. Who owns the rights to this story, we want to make a bid."
2,falling apart,"showed up quickly and on time, but the description stated ""some wear on binding"". The pages are falling out. not bad because the book was only 2 dollars"
3,"Opinions, We all have them","I'm not sure what I expected from this novel, but I never found it. It was depressing. Yes, life is hard, but...It should of ended much sooner than it did. It could of been a good novel, but never reached the goal. By no means would I pass this book on to another."
3,Did not work on my hitch,"Unfortunately, I didn't attempt to use this until well after my 30 day return window had closed, or I would be sending it back. I have a Ford Explorer with a Class IV hitch, and there wasn't any way to get this locking pin to work; the locking cap is so big it made it impossible to turn the key to lock it, rending the entire thing useless."
1,Just had to cut mine off,"Bought this about a year ago and pretty much left it in place. I went to unlock it last week and it was frozen. Tried WD40, graphite, etc. and no go. I had to take out my reciprocating saw and cut it off. Fortunately, that took about 5 minutes. Unfortunately, a thief could have done the same!!!"
2,"Great for 1/2"" but don't purchase if you need 5/8""","I have a 2"" receiver and need the pin to work in the 5/8"" configuration (with the adapter sleeve installed). The pin inserts fine but pulling it out is a PITA! The inner bolt pulls right out but the outer sleeve remains behind with the weight of the trailer holding it tightly in place."
4,lock,Very sturdy and easy enough to use. I use for salt water so you have to lube it up from time to time. Otherwise it works as stated.
5,One of the best inspirational cd's I have heard,"Desiree Goyette's voice is as angelic as the words that she sings. Listening to each arrangement allows one to feel wrapped in the arms of divine Love. One of my favorites is ""As A Little Child"" which truly touches deep in my heart while not tiring of Desiree's incredible vocals. This CD is truly for anyone looking for inspirational music that will uplift you during times of doubt and reinforce during times of focused clarity."
2,Only high and luke warm heat,"Manufacturers of these burners need to figure out that people want high med and low temps. I ordered this one because it was the only one in my price range that did not have the fact that it gives you no temperature control in the reviews. There were some other ones I liked more but I hoped this one wouldn't have the same problem. I am sad to discover that my gamble was fruitless.My stove top does not work and i cannot afford a new stove, so I got this. It will cook my food better than a broken stove, but I was hoping for better quality. I eat rice everyday and I think it will be hard to simmer it on a low heat the way you have to when cooking rice when i can only put it on high. I think i will try to put one burner on and set the pot halfway on the lit burner and half on the cold burner. Its a shame i have to do such a silly and potentially dangerous thing just to cook some rice. please someone invent a quality table top burner!"
3,Fun for Kids,"I guess I didn't realize what I was buying and I bought this for myself. I have to admit I had fun with it for awhile! It was fun to create a customized kitty, name it feed it, dress it up and even enter it in cats shows. I really liked the game where the cats sing and the cupid game is fun also. But it got so I almost felt guilty putting it down because one of the kitties would run out of food or need to be groomed, etc. Then I was afraid I would start scratching through the protective skin on the screen so I traded it back to Amazon. I would recommend it for children, especially if they have been fussing for a live pet; this could get them accustomed to the concept that pets have to be cared for continuously. Not much fun for adults, but that's okay - kid's are entitled to their own fun! Word to the wise for parents, make sure that you have a protective skin on the screen for this game."
2,Purr Pals,"Purr Pals is the perfect game for the people who aren't fond of the Nintendo dogs DS game. The cats are very realistic, but it is almost impossible to earn money. Also, the cats have endless needs and it takes forever to keep them well fed and happy. Overall, it becomes very repetitive, the cats are the only bonus to the game."
4,meow meow,"I bought this for my grandchildren ages 6 and 8. What no one has mentioned is that there is a constant sound of meow, meow. I realized that it is to the tune of March of the Valkyrie by Wagner. They played it constantly for the first few days (snow days at home) and still play it regularly."
3,Got Old,"I suppose its like every other game we parents buy for the kids, they play with it for a while and then they get board with it. My daughter enjoyed it for a while then we sold it. I hate buying new games anymore, buy it used."
2,Purr Pals Review,"I didn't like this game very much.I bought this from a local game store along with another game called LOL. I ended up returning both. I returned LOL because your friend has to have the game to be able to use it at all, when I thought everyone could play on one Nintendo DS. When I tried to play a mini-game on Purr Pals it got stuck and I had to turn off the game. I traded this game and LOL in for Petz Horsez 2 which I am very happy with so far except for I can't seem to brush the horses right. I didn't try competitions. I may be unfairly rating this because I didn't do much in it. But what I did in it I didn't like very much. You can clean the kitten's litter box, which I thought was neat. You can also spray your kitten with water when it misbehaves, which I also thought was cool.I think this game would be enjoyable for younger kids, although you read in this game some - but some older kids may enjoy it, though."
2,An Okay Game.......,"I'm using my mom's account for this.I bought the Purr Pals DS game about 3 months ago, and on the first day I played it, I found out I did NOT like it. The concept of the game is fun, but your cat needs CONSTANT CARE. For example, I went to play a few of the minigames, and when I came back, my cat needed SO much food and water, SO much grooming, and SO much petting. Some people might like this, but they would need to play their DS every second practically. Overall, this game is OK, in my opinion."
3,"Not enough mini games, boring after a while, even for a 4 year old","I bought this game for my 4 year old, almost 5. The game is super easy and cute, however it's really boring. The game only has 4 mini games to play, in order to make money, to buy supplies or accessories. I, the mom, thought the game was really adorable at first. Both my child and I got bored with the game after 2 weeks. The game would of been much better if the maker of this game added more mini games. We sold our copy on Ebay to buy another game. I'm glad we did."
2,The Poop on Purr Pals,"Purr Pals is a very repetitive game in which you must take care of your cat (which has a tendency to use the restroom a bit too much!) The mini games get boring very quickly. Some of the graphics are more realistic than others. You can customize your cat so he/she has pink or blue whiskers! It's cute and fun at first and then it gets very, very dull and predictable. Of course this is only my opinion and you must use your own judgment before purchasing any video game because everyone has their own idea of what a fun video game truly is! C : I believe this game caters to younger users (13 and younger)In my opinion Nintendogs is more interesting, although it also become very repetitive!"
3,Purr Pals DS,"My youngest grandson thought he had to have this game, but he lost interest in it early on. Other games were more interesting."
3,if you are under 10,"I bought this game yesterday and I am already bored with it I am 14 and according to the reviews here it is great but unless you are of the younger sort and don't actually have a cat already then this game is probably not for you.Pros-mini games are alright-if you don't have a cat then this could be fun-multiple rooms-cat shows-graphics-you can discipline your cat with a squirt gunCons-repetitive-cat is always starving,dirty,in need of attention or bored-only one cat at a time can be played with-boring-cats do not look like cats they look like pictures of cats with hinges-annoyingly sponsored by Purina- I think my cat has fleas- geared towards younger kids that can readIf you don't mind these minor problems then I guess this game is for you."
4,Very Good,This game is very cute! Only I'm flat broke on this game and only buddy can get me money! So much poop for one little kitty! You need a lot of caring for this kitty!The only thing I do not like is that it makes my DS freeze a lot. Luckilly it saves on its own!
4,Good Game,"Purr Pals is an okay game. Here is a basic, brief summary of the game.You come in, adopt a cat, and move into your home. Your cat has four basic needs: Hunger, Love, Play, and Cleanliness. There is a Needs meter, and the higher the Need goes, the more your kitten will get upset.You get an allowance every day, and the better you take care of your kitty, the more money you will get. If you haven't taken care of a Need, then you will have a penalty, and get less money. To earn money (used to buy food, litter, toys, decor, and accessories) you can either play mini games, spend your allowance wisely, or enter in a Purina Cat Competition.Your cat will have a special personality.Graphics: 6/10Music: 5/10Goals: 7/10Total: 8/10I hope you learned a bit more about Purr Pals and I hope you have enjoyed this review."
4,Purr Pals,"This is an okay game. The graphics are pretty good, but overall it is not really that fun. The cats get hungry and the allowance is small and the food is expensive. It is somewhat similar to nintendogs, except you can't take the cat on walks, but you can take the cat in different rooms. The cats are not together and are all seperate. It is overall just the average game, nothing very special. I would only reccomend it if your expectations aren't high, so don't be dissapointed."
5,"I have a purrfect kitten, mommy!",This is a great way for my autisitc son to take care of a pet without hurting our real pets. He has learned to be gentaler and what it means to be a resonsable pet owner. The family cats have been more responive to his attendtion and he is more calm when petting and playing with them and doesn't run up on them. It is a great game to teach responsiblity.I give it 5 stars and a super A plus.
5,A revelation!,"This is the only recording of Die Liebe der Danae worth considering. It is the first to present the score complete. Krauss's performance while excellent was spoiled by poor sound-engineering. Franz Grundheber in the role of Jupiter is magnificent. Manuela Uhl's Danae is ravishing, complete with exquisite high pianissimos. This is now my favourite opera of Richard Strauss."
4,Cheap and affordable,This is a decent product.No problem at all. Just it takes little time to adjust frequency if you do not have experience.Also Delivery was very quick.Satisfied!!!
4,LockSmith Best Buy ! !,Very High quality tool. Very reasonable price. I scored this a four because of how easy it is to cross-thread the aluminum shaft nut(s)...A must have for professional automotive locksmithing...
1,Pickapeppa has grit in it,"I am a huge fan of Pickapeppa sauce. Use it on everything. However, the last three bottles I have purchased contained some kind of grit in it. It looks like black sand. Hope they fix this problem, and it goes back to its usual high quality. Won't eat it until then."
5,A Sauce for all Seasons,"Love the taste, especially the mango flavour. This sauce can go on any meat. Will do nicely on hot dogs - a completely different but spicy taste compared to the usual ketchup and or mustard. It's worth its price"
4,A wealth of Information at your fingertips,"Authors James Karnbach and Carol Bernson take the reader on a journey through history with the Rolling Stones. They highlight the important events, the concert tours, the album releases, etc., as well as touching on the numerous celebrations, disappointments, and critical moments that have been part of the Rolling Stones' existence for more then three decades.Included in this book are rare pictures of Stones' memoribilia, many of which I have never seen in a book before (And I have read a good number of books on the Rolling Stones). Much recognition should be given to the authors for gathering up so much data. However, if you are looking for a biographical book about the members of the band, you should pass this up. This is really a reference guide."
4,Very good but missing some information,"Great book but the setlists are still incomplete, expecially the 1970's - 1982. With the internet most of the information can be obtained from tape traders and other web sights. Definetly worth the money. The hardback editon is a must if you are a diehard Stones tape collector."
3,Hot Tray,Nice product. It's pretty large but works well when trying to keep food warm for a family dinner.
4,Really the only thing of its kind on an important Byzantine family,"Together with the Paleologos and Comnenos families, the Dukas family supplied one of the major threads in the history of the Eastern Roman Empire -- including several emperors -- although the author makes the point that the name was also a title and that not all those who bore it were blood relations to each other. Nevertheless, this volume attempts to provide sketches of all known Doukai, with detailed citations to the sources where they are mentioned and with familial relationships noted where they can be determined. Polemis invented many of the techniques later followed by later scholars and his work has held up well."
4,The Return of Helen of Troy,"John Erskine wrote this book in 1925. He wrote this book as a historical narrative starting with her return to Troy.The chapters include:Helen's ReturnHelen's ReturnThe Younger GenerationTheir EldersDeath and BirthHelen's BeautyIn 1927 a silent film was based on this novel, which was nominated for an Academy Award in 1928 in the category of 'Best Title Writing'. However, in that year ""The Jazz Singer"" received an award for introducing sound to film, and the category for which ""The Private Life of Helen of Troy"" was nominated was dropped.The portrait in this book of Helen is not what I had expected--she is a very frank and an opinionated woman yet conventional."
2,Amateurish,"The author has a very weak grasp of 19th century Russian culture - which is tremendously important when trying to help people understand Anna Karenina.In addition, the author whitewashes 21st century libertine morality all over the novel and makes Tolstoy seem like a free love hippie.Although the book is about how genuine human emotion can lead people to destroy their lives and those around them through things like following love through adultery - the Sparknotes author makes it seem like the only problem in the book is those other pesky 19th century Russians who won't take a chill pill and lighten up on Anna.Search elsewhere on the internet for free for help understanding Anna Karenina.This Sparknotes is very misleading in its interpretation."
5,A real ensemble (for a change),"Having performed this piece a couple of times in the 70s, I was first struck by the instrumentation in the current version. Gone is the gamelan-like ricky-ticky edge caused by too many percussive instruments (and I was a percussionist!). This softening is also considerably helped by the decision to assign the Pulse to a synth rather than a piano. Kudos to whoever thought of THAT one.The second thing that struck me is the fact that these guys actually listen to one another. This performance doesn't sound, at least to these ears, like the 2 rehearsals then do the gig situation that has produced a great many mediocre, or just plain bad performances and recordings of this work. Instead, it strikes me that there must have been many many sessions sharing ideas, experimenting, discarding, adding, editing and on and on. In four short words, a real group effort.This realization is a must-have for fans of the genre. Bjork, how about some cross-marketing?"
5,Wonderful recording,"Everyone else has gone into depth about the hows and whys of ""In C."" All I want to say about it is - it'll make you feel glad to be alive. And that means alot these days. This Bang On A Can version is the best version of ""In C"" I've ever heard. My only complaint is that since this version clocks in at 45 minutes, they should've been able to pull another additional work from the BOAC archives that would've nicely complimented this piece. But no matter - it's still very worth the money."
2,Cheesy Kung Fu Flick,"""Bruce Lee's Secret"" is a biopic about Bruce Lee's early years in the USA. For some reason, however (probably legal reasons), his name has been changed to 'Bob.' He is played by veteran Bruce Lee imitator Bruce Li, who does a servicable job. The film traces 'Bob's' work in a Chinese restaurant where he makes enemies with a local gang, opening his own kung fu school, the creation of 'jeet kun do,' and...er, more run-ins with gangs. This seems to have been shot mostly in an Asian suburb/park, giving the movie a strange low-budget feel. It's not a whole lot more interesting than any other Bruceploitation movie, although there are plenty of fight scenes, particularly towards the end.The DVD from Jalisco is in 1.33:1, heavily cropped from the film's probably 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The image is a bit sharper than expected, although still fairly scratchy. The dubbed sound is as you'd expect. There are, unsurprisingly, no extras. The menu design and the box are both blah."
5,2008 Gramophone Gold Disc,This set won the 2008 Gramophone Gold Disc against some very stiff competition over the last 30 years.
5,Saint-Saens: The Complete Works for Piano & Orchestra,"A beautiful CD, brand new and exactly what I ordered but apparently I don't understand what free shipping means because it looks like I was charged for shipping."
2,a different view,"Sorry to rain on the parade of praise, but,in my view, this set is over-rated and over-priced. I'll quote Hurwitz's review on ClassicsToday.com: "".....where's the charm, the fantasy, the characterful phrasing, and those sudden gushes of warmth that energize even these comparatively neo-classical Romantic works?"".Hough is technically brilliant but pounds these works into submission while the orchestral accompaniment is often too aggressive for works of such refinement, wit, and subtlety; tempos are often too fast to allow for the poetry of the works to shine through and the sound is too dry with the piano forward in the mix.I recently sold this set and bought Roge/Dutoit for less than a third of the price.I also have Collard's inexpensive set and these two recordings complement each other very well.I suggest to anyone wanting to buy: try listening to all three before purchasing.Your local library network should be able to help with that."
4,clocks galore!,"With an extensive listing of every well known American clock maker, as well as a plethora of information about even the most arcane of manufacturers, this invaluable book repays its readers many times over! Comparative market pricing coupled with historical and little known facts make this a must-have for anyone with even a smidgen of curiosity about clocks. Well organized and easy to read, comprehensive and simple to get around, this book offers thousands of examples of clock and clock makers, and will satisfy the bent for precision and efficiency of even the most avid clock enthusiast."
4,great book,This is a great book for boys. My son received this book for christmas and loved it. Fun for all ages.
1,Second-rate comedy but first-rate sexism,"This book is fart, snot and ""gross-out"" jokes non-stop. My sons got it as a present and I wish my sister had read it first. They were only slightly interested (to be nice to their aunt) and I was offended. Aren't boys supposed to be something more than ""gross-out"" lovers?"
5,These are perfect games and exercises for any family,"While THE BIG BOOK OF BOY STUFF is intended for ages 8-14, in actuality it will appeal to many an adult and is featured here for its survival recommendations for harried parents. Here are over 1,000 ways to entertain a boy, from jokes and fireworks to armpit bagpipes, experiments, and juggling practice. These are perfect games and exercises for any family - and any parent seeking to distract or entertain a boy.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
1,Not Rockabilly,"I recieved this CD and to my surprise the guitar player, bass player and drummer are not the original Rockats. This is not Rockabilly - this is rock."
3,"Read Cook's Novel ""Abduction"" Instead","This book was quite OK, but I did not enjoy it nearly as much as Cook's other novels, of which I have read many. This book is more science fiction, but with a medical bent to it. I think his book, ""Abduction"" was much better science fiction (which I rated five stars). This particular book was, I felt, a modern-day version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" and I couldn't get that thought out of my mind for the duration of the entire novel. The characters are great, and believeable, and the plot was fine, just not as great as his other books."
2,not what I expected from Robin Cook,"This is the first Robin Cook novel I have ever read. But given his popularity and success, I expected more.The concept behind the novel is pretty good. Black rocks fall from the sky. People pick them up and get sick. But instead of having the flu, they have been infected by an alien virus that is planning to take over the planet.But despite the good idea, the book isn't very good. The writing was not the caliber that I expected from such a successful author. It seemed more like something from a college student trying to write his first novel. I wasn't impressed.I had to make myself finish reading this book, just because I hate to quit reading a book in the middle. I hoped it would get better but in the end I was disappointed."
1,Just awful!,"The worst novel by far that I have read by Cook. A highly unbelievable plot, clunky dialogue, and a ridiculous ""love story"" about the love of a mutant virus for a foxy coed. Cook's attempt to write a sci fi novel is a fiasco. As has been noted, he should stick to writing medical thrillers, some of which are pretty good."
2,Not original!,"It's a mix of Bodysnatcher and Visitors, where only a small group saves the whole earth. Besides some unreality, there's nothing new. I've read it quite fastly, without emotion.Cook makes better when stories, even if fictionary and futuristic, have some grade of realism (i.e. it may happens)."
3,Is this what the doctor ordered?,"On the up side, Cook's foray into science fiction moves alongat a very readable pace, earning it a 5 on the scale. On the downside, it seems Cook has sacrificed quality of dialogue in the interest of , what is for him, novelty of plot. I can't help but think that if Cook had taken a little more time and effort writing this book it may have earned an 8 or better. One of Cook's greatest strengths as an author has been his ability to blend his technical knowledge with a believable plot line to create a convincingly scary story. Apparently for this outing, Cook has freed himself of this constraint and has produced a work that is less than enthralling."
1,An awful book from a terrible excuse for an author.,"Tripe like this consumes resources (paper, ink, shelf space) that could be used for better books. Help raise Humanity's standards: avoid all of Cook's books (except as a source of kindling). Only the very young or very ignorant could like this book. Even the ""official"" reviews (above) hate it"
4,"Combo of ""The BodySnatchers"" and ""War of the","I think Cook drew from two other books as stated in my""one line summary."" The book,however, was fun to read as thechase was on...."
1,Absolute drivel,"I'm stuck in an airport with a ninety minute flight delay and nothing to read. Not much to pick from at the Corpus Christi Airport bookstand. Took a flyer on this book. Egad, what a putrid read.Where to start ... paint-by-numbers plot? Character development? dialog? sanctimonious BS enviromessage? Convenient narrative manipulation?We'll start with the character development. There isn't any. Everybody in the book is pure cardboard. The neurologist, the doctor, the student, Cassy, ... take your pick. I didn't buy any of them.Dialog is simply wretched. A tin ear for human speaking doesn't begin to cover the author's lack of grasp in this matter. Maybe its just too much time in the medical books. There's no way English is this guy's first language.I won't bother with the rest. The book had no redeeming features. By the end I was rooting for the virus to put all these poor saps out of their misery."
2,Under Cooked,"Invasion does not live up to my expectation of Robin Cook. Unbelievable story, far fetched sci fi. His med thrillers are always based on a plausible idea gone bad; this Invasion is a disappointment, I sped read the last 70 pages to get the misery over with."
2,Sci-fi not a good recipe for Cook!,"My excitement about reading something different from Robin Cook was soon diminished after about 50 pages of ""Invasion"". It's too bad that the crew from ""Mystery Science Theater"" can't lampoon books because they would have a field day with this tepid attempt at sci-fi. Hopefully, Dr. Cook will stick with the subject matter that he knows best - the medical thriller. If you're looking for a good Robin Cook book to read, don't start with this one. It is for serious devotees only!"
1,Get back to earth!,I have been a devoted fan of Dr. Cook until this novel. It started out ok and went downhill from there. The author is a medical murder mystery writer not a sci-fi writer. The story line was so predictable I skipped paragraphs just to get it over with. No matter how awful a book is I will read it to the end because I paid for it. If I could have returned it I would have. Skip this book and read his other novels they're much better.
3,"A so-so remake of ""Body Snatchers""","Something about the novel's pace and/or premise kept me reading this rather thinly-disguised remake of ""Body Snatchers."" But the characters are one-dimensional, the plot is full of holes, and the dialogue is often laughably wooden. ""Cathy, you must flee!!"" Give me a break! This is a genre I'd not return to, were I Dr. Cook."
2,Disappointing. Nowhere near the level I have come to expect.,"Robin Cook should stick to what he does best: writing INCREDIBLY BELIEVABLE medical thrillers which keep you on the edge of your seat, terrified that in the not too distant future, or even NOW, these things can be /are actually happening. This space invasion stuff is beneath him and best left to those with less imagination who are dedicated to this area. Being a physician I especially enjoy his medical thriller aspects; space junk is a dime a dozen. I expected more from Robin Cook. Please stick to the old, better format!"
2,INVASION is a disappointing experiment in science fiction.,"Robin Cook has diverged from his normal genre with Invasion, arather implausible tale about aliens who wait billions of years toinfiltrate the dominant life forms of planets throughout the universe. The concept of 'invasion by virus' was interesting, but the rest of the hard science was not convincing; indeed, little effort was expended to explain the mechanics of the aliens' science. The plot was weak and the characters were poorly developed - when several died I didn't care. Try again, Robin. This is simply not in the same class with your medical thrillers."
1,If you can believe that...,"The earth is invaded by strange black discs which sting and infect people. An alien virus implanted millions of years ago into mankind's genetic code is being revived. People start to behave strangely and some of them become mutants, half lizard, half human. But a handful of haunted refugees struggle to piece together the puzzle of this improbable invasion in an attempts to save humanity.To be avoided at all costs."
3,Invasion,I thought the paper cover would be more new than it was. The book itself was in great shape.
2,A BIG disappointment,"I was very eager to pick up this book after all the other great Cook books I'd read but after I finished the prologue I was very disappointed. I mean, Cook, doing a medical thriller about aliens! I found it very predictable and, I hate to say it but, stupid! I will admit after I finished the book I wasn't as upset but I still thought this was definitely one of Cook's worst books."
3,A bit of a let down,"I had eagerly anticipated reading this one. I bought it at the store, got busy on it as soon as I could, and finished it. Am I the only one that was left wondering what happened to everybody at the end? If you want good Cook, try Toxin or Chromosome 6. The characters are paper thin and development is poor. The plot is has a reckless quality to it. Save your time and money on this one."
3,"Good plot, great action, poor characters","The people who are worked into this cleverly designed plot are the book's weakest point. Both men and women (particularly the women) act like marionettes manipulated by the author, even though he does his best to make them real by adding homy little details about their activities. Unfortunately, these are often so irrelevant that they distract from the story line. The science is sometimes a bit creaky, but the book's strongest point is it's fast-moving action. I HAD to find out what happened next, and couldn't put it down."
1,What was he on?,"I could not believe that he wrote something so bad. it is definetly below his standards. The plot, the characters, everything was awful. If he actually put some thought into this novel, it would have been somewhat decent. Instead, it is a cheesy attempt to write a science fiction novel, when the author has almost no clue on how to do it. Cook should stick with the medical mysteries, it is what he is good at."
3,Quick Review,"A mysterious flu-like illness unlike any other strain suddenly surfaces. The infected are only sick for a short period of time, but afterward their personalities are altered. What starts out as a mere illness is later revealed to be an invasion of beings not from this world.Robin Cook writing what he's known for -- medical drama -- but this time with a sci-fi twist. Cooks unnecessary use of large words and medical jargon detracts a bit from the narrative but not overly so."
1,This book reminded me why I don't like Robin Cook,"Ok, can we get real for just a second here? Since this book is supposed to be a medical thriller, andnot science fiction, you would expect a half-way plausible plot. Well, don't get your hopes up, because this book is so completely unbelievable, it's ridiculous. The characters are just plain lame, the dialogue and speech make you laugh out loud, and the ending was horrible. I don't know why anyone would give this book a good review."
4,It is cool.,"I liked this book because it is a really creepy book to think that actually could happen. Thankyou, Jessica"
1,BOOOOOORING,"This was my first Robin Cook. It was bad. Some people may have liked it, but I didn't.The plot is creative and interresting, but I found the book boring. It's a good thing I ignored this book and read some of his better books."
2,"Watch the movie ""Invasion of the Bodysnatchers"" instead!!",Poor. A real let down. Having read some of Robin Cook's earlier work I thought I would enjoy this book. How wrong can you be! So many elements of the book are from the 1978 version of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers that I can't believe it wasn't written whilst watching the movie. The book was then padded out with ever possible cliche available in this genre.
5,A Sci-fi Novel With Twists and Turns,Robin Cook is brilliant. Invasion is an amazing book with many twists and turns that make the plot thicken every page. I have not yet finished it but I have only about 50 pages left and I began reading it two days ago. I could not stop reading it. I would stay up til 2 in the morning. The characters are in-depth and you start to take sides. And the amazing thing is it that I am only fourteen years old. I hardly ever read books. Buy the book.
5,I gave this series to a friend. I'm glad I have it back.,"Humberto Ramos is one of my favorite artists. This being one of his starting pieces shows his progression as well as his artistic temperament. Other than that, the story is very compelling. Being a teenager is one thing. But, being a teenage vampire with a means to save the world, that's a whole different story. I can feel for Alex in this and I'm glad I got this book once again."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A teenage type tale of a boy that becomes a vampire, and the problems and politics that vampires and vampire hunters become involved in. He also has a few problems dealing with his still living relatives, being undead and all. You get the friend, babe, mysterious mentor, and a mythological knight, to boot."
3,Just ok,"This series really could have been great. The ideas and themes of the book have been touched on in other books and movies but none have been bold enough to cram so much into one story. This book has it all: Vampires, Magic, Angels, Demons, Dragons, and even some Teen Angst. Most other reviewers complain about the artwork of the book, but im a big fan of Ramos. I do agree though that it was a bit too cartoonish for this kind of story. I wish he would have used a style similar to the one he used in his other book, Revelations. However, the art is not the only thing cartoonish in the book; the writing also falls short and almost reads like saturday morning cartoon version of Preacher. That is where i found the book missed the mark. I think that if this book had been more serious it would be a classic."
1,Someone Get That Penciller a Nude Model!,"Mediocre story; continues the long tradition of Wildstorm and Image artists who have clearly never seen a naked lady before. This comic has some of the most ludicrous anatomy I have ever seen, as though Rob Liefeld and Marc Silvestri taught a class in figure drawing and gave A's to anyone who showed up. Terrible."
1,not very good...,"I'm not sure if I read the same book as these other reviewers. The plot is sub-Anne Rice drivel about vampires that dress and act like Marvel superheroes, Humberto Ramos' art is a grusome cross between manga style and Rob Liefield, and Brian Augustyn's script reads like Chris Clarmont on crack. All the chracters are always introducing themselves by exclaiming their inner angst as loudly as possible, usually in some cutely spelled comic book ""accent"". Uhgg... this is all the stuff that embarasses me when I try to show someone that there really are graphic novels worth reading. Give this a pass."
5,call of duty,"excellent game but to me too short, waiting for expansion to showup at my house, highly recommend this game as it is a challengeeven on easy level, people who complain about the sound,bugs,etc should stick to arcade games as a challenging game like this is obviously too much for them, if you like soldier of fortune ordeus ex you will like this game."
3,"Great Singleplayer, Mediocre Mutiplayer",The singleplayer game in this is extraordinary. Without a doubt the best FPS I've played to date.But the multiplayer is a different story. It is mediocre at best. Snipers dominate most maps. A lot of maps are poorly designed for multiplayer. Weapon balance is not too good. No anti-cheat program. And Infinity Ward has been pretty quiet when it comes to addressing the public about a patch or anti-cheat program.
5,Best shooter since half life,"OMG i just finished the game and u know waht i did? i clicked new game and swore an oth to myself never to tounc the quick save button. U may be thinking what i wrote as the title is a bit hard ""how can it be the best shooter sonce half life?"" quite simpley u have to play it for yourself. the scripted scens are amazing and i found sometimes u just had to sit back from your computer and admire it. Oh and thing play as the russkis it rocks! See u on the battlefield. Scarecrow out"
4,Good game,"Critics say it's the best war game ever. I'd say if it was released 2 years ago, there's no doubt about it. With too many similarities with those mega hits released before, you won't be impressed easily. That doesn't mean I did not enjoy this game. I can't stop playing and I love almost every aspects of the game. The sequence design, graphic, and sound are outstanding and most important the multi-player mode is unbelievable smooth. I don't consider MOHAA a five star game and same as Wolfenstien. But I do think Hitman and Max Payne 5. So it probably just my personal preference.The conclusion: go get this game and you won't regret!!"
5,Cheap fun multiplayer war action,"I've actually only played single-player for about five minutes just to learn the moves on this game and the rest of the time have gone online for the multiplayer, which is great fun.Like Vampire Bloodlines, I recently bought this at the reissued price of $20 AUD and it has already earned it's price in hours of entertainment.Great that the servers still have quite a lot of players online, despite this game having been out a while, and the action is certainly addictive and quite intense.It's as realistic as it needs to be and has a good atmosphere. Definitely one for Saving Private Ryan fans."
5,The Greatest,"This Has to one of the best WWII games ever, it has great graphics and amazing Multiplayer Mode. The Multiplayer Mode is something that really helps the game alot. The Single Mode mode is Shaky because sometimes it is impossible to one level. I recommend this game to anyone who like WWII shooters. Happy Gaming and I hope this review was helpful.:)"
4,Call of Duty,"For once we see a game other than the Tom C. games where you can play in a real war where you have a team of AI's who help you along the way. A realsitic game right down to the ""clinging sound"" that the bandleers make when you empty your clip. MP game is alright, but I would think they would have objectives to make rather than an all out bloodfest, which is cool for a while, but then growes borging after a few rounds. Anyone who enjoys a good WW2 game and has grown tired of MOH, try this one out, and I think you will enjoy it!"
3,It's OK,"I neither love nor hate this game. It's not the type of game you can play for hours and hours and forget about time. As fun as certain scenes in the game can be, others you just want to get past as soon as possible. The game play is fun, but it's your typical 1st person shooter: fast-paced but little strategy involved. Being the Russian soldier is funner than the American or British. If you enjoy 1st person shooters, you will enjoy this game. If you prefer more strategy-based games, look elsewhere."
3,Call of Duty,"The game itself is excellent, but loading it and support is another. It played for the longest time, but when I had to load video drivers again, it stopped loading. No matter what I tried, it failed. Absolutely no support available for this product."
3,cod 1,"the game came in good condition. i love the campaign and the multiplayer but it can get a bit boring, afterwhile."
2,Same old tired game,"While this game had decent scripted scenarios, this basically led to zero replay ability. Which wouldn't be so bad if the game were longer, but as it stands, the average completion time is about 10 hours or less. For my $50, this is by far not enough entertainment. And if you say that there is a bright side with the multi-player, I saw, play Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and you'll get a visually similar game, with tons of better game play. In the end, a game like Medal of Honor is much better than this, even if it is older. I was looking forward to the storming of Stalingrad level, and needless to say, it couldn't hold a candle to the Omaha beach invasion from MoHAA. There was nothing stellar about this game, nothing that made it stand out from the crowd at all. In some respects, the I found the story of RtCW much more intriguing, even if it was fiction. Call of Duty is the same tired formula of FPS's that everyone's used before, nothing new here."
5,great start to the call of duty family,"great game I got for my Birthday.Pros-.3 campaigns America at D day, Britain at France, Russa at Stalingrad.realistic weapons.Good graphics.great online multiplayer.this game got me use to first person shooter games on computer by using the w,a,s,d keyscons- none"
4,Tribute to Medal of Honor or a simple clone?,"Call of duty has great graphics, tank battles, mad charges of enemy gun implacements and players have lots of weapons from which to choose; just like the Medal of Honor games.In fact, I can't see any real difference between the two games, and that is sort of a good thing since Medal of Honor is such a great game. You do get your money's worth buying Call of Duty, it held my interest during the duration of the game even though there is nothing really new or different in it."
4,"Great Visuals, good atmosphere!","I fount the game too be really good, I love working with a squad that actually shoots at the enemy versus having too depend on doing everything on your own. However, the game is too darn short. I picked it up on Monday, and here it is Tuesday night and I am done. I didn't play it for hours either, just and hour or two here and there."
3,single player for call of duty,"i can play multiplayer, but i'll be dammed if i can play single player.i keep getting put in correct cd."
1,"Great effects, medium entertainmet, LOW SKILL","I have played a few games in my time. This game is SO not worth the money. You would be better off renting Saving Private Ryan, A Bridge Too Far, and Enemy at the Gate. (The story line follows them almost exactly) The movies will leave you with a good memory....""Hey, good movie!"" you'll say. The game on the other hand will leave you saying.....""I don't just want my money back...I want my TIME back!"" In fact, A Bridge Too Far is LONGER than the amount of time I spent on the game. Granted, the effects were better, but....TOO EASY. Skip it...or borrow it from me....I can't (in good faith) sell it. Lesson learned."
1,It's just Medal Of Honor with a different title,"It is an EXACT copy of Medal of Honor Allied Assault and the expansion packs that followed. Don't waste your money.They didn't even try to make it orginial. It is just the same old, scripted mission action repackaged.I enjoyed the game. I liked it...but I did not think it was worth my money.There are some new things that are nice...but that list is so short, it is still not worth $40 or $50!!!DON""T BELIEVE THE HYPE>>>>>>>>Download the demo or borrow a copy from a friend and TEST DRIVE it first people.If you like it...then buy it but don't rush out because of the overhyped 5 star votes in here!!!"
1,Can Not Be Played,This game requires a video card that is not in the Windows ME computer. This game can not evn be played on our computer. I think this is ridiculous! If I would have known this I would have never purchased it.
2,It does'nt seem to agree with my PC nor my Radeon 9800...,"I got a chance to finish this game one time all the way through, but this was before my system had problems with this game, like freezing up in certain seens on the game. I still can't figure out what the problem is of why the game freezes up on my PC, I have a Dell 8200 running a P4 at 2.60Ghz and 1gig of RDRAM PC800, Radeon 9800 All in wonder card. I'm still trying to figure out how to work around this, I have the latest drivers on all my hardware.This is a great game, and there's a 90% chance it will work on your PC. Me, I've mostly been a Metal of Honor fan, never had no problems running that game. This one is fun if you can get it to run in max graphics without freezing up."
5,Very good game (and i dont usually play shooters),"I dont play shooters... preferring MMORGs (everquest, city of heroes) and strategy... This however is very very good... Thesolo play was very fun. My only complaint is that the multiplayerstuff is too fast - and the"
4,SWEEEEEEEEET!,"This game had me ducking and weaving and wincing as bullets flew past. It is very realistic, and some of the missions are gory. There is a mission right out of Enemy at the Gates, as someone mentioned previously. As I started playing it, I was yelling ""I want the gun! Give me the gun! Awww, crap, I got the bullets!"" which led my wife to come running in. For a moment, she thought I was playing a game based on the movie.I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes FPS and WWII games. This combines both spectacularly!The only downside is how short the game is. I got it for Christmas and I've already completed Easy mode and that was only spending a couple hours a day on it.I'll be buying United Offensive next, and probably Medal of Honor, based on the recommendations from others who own both. Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS GAME."
2,Good Gameplay/ Short Playing Time,"The gameplay fells average, just like the ""on a track"" feel of Medal of Honnor Allied Assault. Not much space to improvise or take another aproach. Just do ""that"" and lets go to the next level. The sound and graphics are very good, nothing new but really pleasant with attention to detail. There's no ""Use"" button, you can not open doors or drive vehicles. The movement is slow, no mather how you are aiming. The best aspect of this game is that,for some times, you can feel very inmersed in the story and in the ""war"" that is going on around you. The multiplayer option needs more development. My biggest complain is the time for completing it. Terribly short time, I finished in TWO days. For a game on this price there are other options in this particular genre (First person) that have a more value for money (Ex. Return to Castle Wolfestein or No One Lives Forever). Get it if you can buy it used for a very low price, but paying more than $40.00 for it is not very wise."
4,Excellent game - way too short,"I played the demo and was instantly blown away. I picked up the game, loaded it up, and was on my way to Nazi killing bliss. The graphics are beautiful, the AI is great, and there are a variety of missions to play through the eyes of other nations. HOWEVER, the game is ridiculously short. I have played it a total of six to eight hours and am already on the last mission. As one other reviewer put it, you feel kind of boxed in. There is not much in the way of exploration, and it is very linear. That being said, this is still an excellent game. I have yet to test the multi-player for this particular game, but hopefully it will be as fun as the single-player."
5,Worth to Buy,I have the games now (2 CD's). And I can't raise my butts from the chair !!! Heellllppp ....
3,It's ok...,"This game has it's ups and downs like every other game does. The thing I liked mainly about the game is the Multiplayer. But the Single Player levels feel small and incomplete. Also i'm playing on a brand new pretty fast computer, and I have all the settings turned to the lowest and there is still some lag. Overall I probably wouldn't have purchased this game if I had already played it before hand."
5,Outstanding Game but short levels,When I first got this game I was so excited to play. As soon as I got home I installed it and almost beat it in 1 night. Now I know perhaps that's were the shortness in gameplay comes(My bAD) Anyways I recommend anyone that likes WW2 First person shooter games to buy this one it is well worth the money.You will not be disappointed!
3,"Great single player, not great multi-player","I played the demo and was astounded by the visuals and atmosphere of the game. The single person game is very good, but the multi-player aspect is lacking appeal. The multiplayer part feels just like Battlefield 1942 with better graphics. The respawn is terrible where it is not uncommon to appear next to a couple enemy soldiers. I hope gets better in a patch, but as of right now, I think I will cut my losses and go back to playing Desert Combat and Medal of Honor."
5,Best First Person Shooter Ever!!!,"Well PC Gamer has said this about Call of Duty:""EARTH SHATTERING!""""The year's best shooter.""""...Call of Duty could replace Half Life as the best shooter ever made.""""The action game of the year has arrived.""""You don't need Band of Brothers when there's a PC Game this all-absorbing.""""I did not see a motion picture in 2003 that grips me like Call of Duty does.""""Just when I thought the WWII genre was getting tired on PC, this game has made me forget about ANY before it.""""Its the new Medal of Honor, but ten times better...""...After playing both of the demo's (the first one was called ""Burnville"") I can say personally that I feel this is the best FPS game (demo anyway) I've ever played! Medal of Honor used to be my favorite until now..."
2,I don't understand the hype with this game...,"This game is nothing compared to the latest Castle Wolfenstein. The multiplayer is good - I always get excellent, fast connections. But the game is real boring. No medics or alternate roles to play. Just shooting each other on and on into eternity. Yippee."
3,Good But Needs Work,"I just played the demo of ""Call of Duty"" and really enjoyed it. The squad format works really well but to me the sound is inferior to any ""Medal of Honor"" title. I have high end speakers and COD just doesn't approach the magnificient sounds of MOH. Maybe they will beef them up in the release.Oterwise, I intend to buy it."
1,Check your video/audio cards!,"I have a 1 year old,and a 3 year old computer,but i have to upgrade the video card,and possibly the audio cards before it will run.It looks great,with positive reviews,but it's gonna cost me.I might just get an X-Box."
4,Intense and kind of educational,"I am not a real computer geek and have a very limited knowledge of games. But for anyone who simply wants to sit down and let off some steam, this is the game for you. Its only real problem is that is goes by pretty quickly but you'll become obsessed with the online play. The great thing about the game is that it really showcases the intensity of battle and the incredible level of Stalingrad is almost an anti-war statement on its own. I sometimes wish games like these, although intended for fun, should also be educational. If you're going to do war, show every aspect of it. A game that shows soldiers dealing with cold, hunger or killing civilians would be an incredible experience. The game also lets everyone know that Tom Hanks wasn't the only victor in WWII. But I wonder how Germans feel that the game uses them like aliens or monsters. Well, enough over-analysis. This is a great game especially for those just starting out in PC gaming."
5,BEST WWII FPS SHOOTER!!!,"Ok, i just want to say that i know nobody is probably gonna read this review. BUT, if they do, i want to say GO BUY THIS GAME. this game has an awesome single player campaig and BETTER MULTIPLAYER THAN HALO. and i have halo. but this game rocks and its not that pricy. so buy this game, and trust me if you liked halo, you'll like this."
4,A good action game that lacks in the historical department,"The game overall is a great action game, based off of the Quake 3 engine it looks good and it plays good on most computers, the singleplayer mode is that of putting yourself into the shoes of three soldiers, a russian a american and from what I think is a english man, although he could be any one of the nationalities of the UK, historically speaking the accounts taken are semi-accurate, namely the american and british ones, but the russian SP missions are innacurate to say the least, it's taken directly from the movie enemy at the gate which is also a hollywoodized version of the actual eastern front. Multipleplayer is a standard death match shoot very close to that of medal of honor and quake 3 death matchs.Overall good game, but unaccurate."
2,Overrated,"I bought this game thinking it would be another Battlefield 1942. I was wrong though however. Like others have said, it is scripted. I wanted a game with unpredictable AI, and this game is very predictable. It reminds me of the James Bond games and there is even a high speed chase in this game which to me is stupid for a WWII game. I feel Activision is trying to cash in on the WWII FPS fad that is going on right now. This game is just a clone of the MOH:AA.The only positive thing I liked about this game is the graphics.Also the multiplayer sucks! The maps are very small and the guys run like they are always trying to do the russian dance of joy.To sum this game up: very overrated!"
4,Call of Duty,"Had a hell of a time installing this game.You need to get a patch for it to work, maybe they've fixed that on later versions. Game play is a blast and very user friendly. Online play can be addicting, be prepared to get waxed until you get good at it. Would like to hit Omaha beach like on Medal."
4,An amateur gamer's review,"This game is VERY good. The missions are mostly authentic, the weapons are very good and the AI are challenging. The AI are NOT a bunch of dummies( except the Russian commissars,LOL).The maps are very authentic, and several are historically based, like the Americans at St. Mere Eglise, The British at the Pegasus bridge, and the Stalingrad missions. Several allied missions somewhat approach the fanciful, like sabotaging the Tirpitz, but still very fun.I wish they had included more missions, but this still doesn't.The authenticity of the weapons is great.The game is very challenging and completely fun.This is something you can't stop playing."
5,Too much!,"This is one of the greatest FPS of all time. Although none can match up to Medal of Honor: Allied assault, This one's the closest I've found. It got great graphics, sound, multiplayer, replay value, and it's historically accurate. If your looking for a well rounded fun FPS, this is the one."
4,One of the best WWII shooters ever,"When I first played Call of Duty, I didnt think it would match up to games like Battlefield 1942 or Medal of Honor. I have to tell you, I was dead wrong.Call of Duty is the most intense and realistic WWII games i have ever played. You can experience WWII through the American, British, and Russian's eyes. The weapons are great, suprisingly the Russian have the best weapons. I loved the PPSH sub machine gun,and the Mosin Nagant bolt action rifle is great for long distances. As far as graphics go, the facial animations are good, the textures are great, it's not as pretty as UT2004, but it's not bad. The Multiplayer is alright, could be better. Overall, Call of Duty is one of the best WWII shooter I have ever played."
4,Hand in Hand,"I first saw this movie back when I attended parochial school (late 60's). I fell in love with it because it showed the relationship between two young innocent children caught up in the differences of their own religion. He is Catholic and she is Jewish. Their friendship starts off pretty rocky but then like all best friends they overcome. I only gave it 4 stars because I wanted more closure towards the ending, otherwise it it would have gotten 5. Great movie!"
5,What a Wonderful Film,"Okay, it is SO dated. Early 1960's social issues and film techniques. That said, I love this film. I saw it with my sister and my favorite aunt when it was first released here in the States, and it stayed with me all my life. When I saw it had been released on DVD, I couldn't wait to order it. I was not disappointed. From the great musical theme (again, very '60s), the wonderful way the two children are depicted, the celebration of imagination, and the positive family and social values, it was just a delight for me to watch it again all these years later. Yes, you will have to let yourself travel back in time to a less frenetic, cynical and cinematically sophisticated time, but if you do, you will come away from this film with a truly warm and happy heart.Hand in Hand"
4,The lives of Country English Women in the 18th Century,"I'm not sure whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars. The author presents a very academic overview of the life of rural Georgian women in England in the 18th and early 19th centuries.A lot of original research has been done for this book and it shows in it's content. The author highlights the lack of real research that has been done on the lives of women in this period. However, despite a well timed re-assesment of the lives of these women, this is essentially an academic work.It highlights the fact that things have never been as bad as many other (feminist) books make out - in essence Jane Austin shows us close to the real world as people lived it in her novels.This book is dry to read, but full of many every day facts for those interested in the ""real"" lives of 18th century country women."
2,A book and it`s Cover,"The content of this book is up to the author`s usual standard - excellent; so why the awful rating? This edition is almost unreadable. the type is almost smudged, the paper quality is of the cheapest imaginable. The binding makes it impossible to open the book to a comfortable position without cracking the spine. As a product it is not worth 10% of what I paid for it. By all means buy the book, just NOT this edition."
5,I Love the Connie Blair Series,"I discovered the Connie Blair books as an adult. I read Nancy Drew growing up, then I discovered the Judy Bolton series as a young adult. I believe the Connie Blair series is the best of them all--well written, interesting characters and plots and just fun. I enjoy reading fun mystery books! I'm only sad that there are so few of them but I treasure them and reread them every so often and I enjoy them every time. I even like the ""earthy"" smell of the older hardback books, they are lightweight even though they are hardback."
2,Rather Poor Blu ray,The 2 stars are for Blu Ray image quality which is poor for a new film and transfer. Lack of detail and resolution and persistent ringing and halos around high contrast edges from digital sharpening give this a nasty video look instead of the intended sublime film look Blu Ray is capable of. The problem's visibility varies somewhat but never goes away and is worst in the opening credits with snow where halos are as thick as they come. Eek. Sound is fine.
2,I Am Not,"Really quite awful. Mostly it got my attention because it incorporates music from various of John Adams' orchestral compositions. Now that I have sat through this bland drama, I am shocked that the composer consented to this appropriation. And the torrent of praise given this film, from even our most insightful professional critics, confirms simply that a tale about a woman who feels trapped but escapes in the end will milk, without fail, any faux-progressive's heart (like auditing coursework from a women's studies program). This is basically a second-rate revival of Tilda Swinton's early feminist film ""Orlando"" in a rather different era and with much less subtlety. The cinematography aspires toward epic luxury but basically conveys a lazy, digital aesthetic with awkward coverage shots and uninventive tracking shots. As a low-budget film, ""I Am Love"" needn't have bothered trying to look like a vintage studio picture, admitting ""I Am Not."""
3,poor,Not a big fan of this movie Tilda can do so much better than this it takes to long to get to the point.
3,An exercise in style...,"This stylish, textured film is certainly a throwback to the 70's silver age of Italian cinema, relishing as it does, later works by Visconti (CONVERSATION PIECE), Rossellini (EUROPA 51), probably Lina Wertmuller (SWEPT AWAY) - and even Bergman (FANNY AND ALEXANDER). It is more derivative than daring, and the themes are simplified and hip, but there is no denying the power of the images Guadagnino devises, and the emotions the varied cast conjures up. It is a lovely film, and Adams' aural contribution is ironically right. Obviously viewers and reviewers who spent time with the extras learned that it is probably not a film for petit-bourgeoisie or burbite right-wingers."
3,Intense clash of personalities,"In other words, not my thing. Personal growth within the industrial dynasty, surviving both success and tragedy without losing one's values ... well, I guess that part will appeal to some people.I'm just there to see Tilda Swinton. According to IMDB, she was nearing 50 when this was filmed - but you'd never know it, except for a delightful bit of mature softness that appears in a steamy scene. (It's a treat that younger women and their partners can look forward to.) Some of the cinematography caught my eye as well, especially the expansive landscapes and minute closeups that become increasingly common as the movie moves on. So, in summary, Swinton is great, some of the imagery will stay with you, but the movie as a whole addresses tastes I don't share.-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters"
2,THIS IS NOT THE FULL VERSION !!!!,"This was my favorite film of 2010. The DVD however is the edited version. There was a beautiful love scene that was VERY important to the story, and for some reason was cut out of the film. How could they just erase all of that emotion? It was so amazingly shot. I am so pissed."
3,Eye of the Beholder,There are absolutely no surprises in what is essentially an Italian soap opera that details the unraveling of a wealthy Milan family. But the story is told so artfully and with such visual elegance that you may not care. Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours. The disc is also a nice edition to any blu-ray collection because it is such a retinally-rewarding experience.
3,"impressive, but ...","... there's something missing, perhaps the husband's presence (i can't remember a single word he said); for that matter, that of most of this too comfortable family. Tilda Swinton is brilliant, as always. in fact, she IS this film. w/o her, it would be just beautiful cinematography. (btw, i feel that only Gong Li is in Tilda's class among international stars. this film is worth seeing just for her performance.)"
3,Beautiful but...,"Beautiful cinematography, perfect for viewing during a Northeast winter! But what could have been a profoundly tragic story is made dull by silly direction. Do we really need closeups of flowers and insects during sex scenes that are themselves too graphic -- what are we cutting away from? Still, it's lovely, and if you can't get to Milan and San Remo, you can die of envy watching this instead. All the acting is excellent, tho the script and direction are not inspired."
2,Horribly fragmented plot,"Just following the sometimes unrelated elements of the plot in this movie was annoying. Things often happened without any setup, basis, or rational reason. It could have been a much better movie if they had just handled the transitions and cut out a lot of the unecessary pieces. I do appreciate the way they allow a woman older than twenty-something to do nude scenes without trying to make her look perfect like the typical American movies do. Without that I'd have given it one star."
2,I Couldn't Really Care,what these poor little rich folks do to ruin each others' lives. A poor Russian woman married a rich Italian factory owner and 30 years later decides a chef friend and partner of her son is who she wants to be with. The script isn't exactly like any other but it isn't all that interesting either. You always know it's going to end badly for all of them without feeling much sympathy for any one of them.
2,Boring,This is a boring movie. I would say you should definitely watch it if you like boring movies about rich people. Otherwise check out the new Transformers!
4,getting richer is a big church mentality,"There ought to be a big Russian church somewhere like in Italy in this movie. Tilda Swinton plays a Russian girl who married into a family that owns a textile factory in Italy. The opening banquet around a big oval table celebrating the retirement birthday of the founder happens slowly, like the snow covering Milan is too big an effect not to be real. The meal is served very slowly and fish soup was a childhood favorite of one main character that is sometimes joked about. Maturity is slow in coming to people who have the winning intensity but don't actually win like Adam and Eve when summer comes."
2,Beautiful fim but missing the opening scenes,"Having seen this film twice in the theaters, I had some friends over for dinner and this movie. Much to my disappointment after the opening credits the film is missing 8-10 minutes of the establishing shots. Either a poor edit or something corrupted in reproduction. As a regular customer of Amazon Video on Demand, this is a first, but now i wish i had bought the blu-ray version.There needs to be quality control or technical validation.This film, in its original entirety is one of the most beautiful Italian movies i have ever seen and is a five star filmCome to think of it, I am going to go out and buy it on Blu Ray now"
3,beautiful sex,"A Russian gal was ages ago relocated to Italy where she made it to the top by getting married a business-inherited-recently local of Milan just to meet a son's same age mate / business partner-a chef (while her boy is dreaming of own restaurant, not a family plant he is working for) to fall in affair with and be kicked out from the riches because of.What is really nice in this fairytale is a point from which a love-making was recorded."
2,Some pictures too scary for the recommended age,"Perhaps I'm the only one that tries to keep the really scary images away, but I won't let my 5 year old read this book because some of the pictures are just a little too scary and I don't want her to have nightmares. The ""ghoul"" that scares the ghosts is just too much for me. Dracula has blood on his teeth which I don't want to have to explain, but really the ghoul with his bloodshot bulging eyes ruined the whole book for me."
5,Fun Halloween Counting Book,"This story was a big hit with my Hallowen obsessed 4yo. The rhyming story follows the same format as that of 'ten little indians' and tells the story of ten timid ghosts who are one by one scared out of their house by a nasty witch. On each page, the witch wears a different disguise to sneak up on the ghosts. My son likes finding the hiding ghosts on every page. Illustrations are great. This has definitely become one of our favorites this year."
4,Exactly as advertised,Shipped in brown wrap so you couldn't see what it was although the shape can give it away. Item was exactly as described. My son was very pleased with his foam bo staff.
4,"Classic, but better Ben Folds","This album is short, but definately sweet. ""Get Your Hands Off of My Woman"" is sure to become a new Ben Folds fan favorite. With it's hilarious lyrics and good beat, it is very similar to the ""Rockin' the Suburbs"" single. Rent-A-Cop is also a hilarious song. I can see the whole concept for the video. Ben Folds in a security guard uniform with faux mustache strolling through a mall, singing this catchy tune. If this song doesn't totally fit every Rent-A-Cop you've ever seen, I'll be surprised. As for the other tracks, ""Them I Got"" is a short but swwet cover of a Ray Charles song. Ben admits to not knowing all the words, but definately lends great feeling and enthusiasm to the short tune. Adelaide, is one of my least favorites, but does have some witty lyrics. I hope you enjoy this album! Great to add to your Ben Folds collection."
4,How to Fix Pixter Color,"This is for the reviewer whose Pixter stopped working. The first screen (home) came up fine, but pressing the stylus to the screen accomplished nothing. I had the exact same problem with my daughter's Pixter. I found the following instructions for calibrating the stylus on the Fisher-Price web site which solved the problem in about 5 seconds:Turn Pixter power on. Wait until you see the Home screen.Find the small hole in the back of your Pixter unit, above the battery compartment door. That's the calibration hole.Insert, push and hold the stylus in the calibration hole. Turn Pixter over so that you can see the screen. When you see two plus signs remove the stylus from the calibration hole.First touch the plus sign in the upper left corner with the tip of the stylus. Then, touch the plus sign in the lower right corner with the tip of the stylus.I hope this helps! Good luck."
1,Get a Leapster instead,"I was very disapointed in the Pixter. We returned ours and got a Leapster. The graphics and controls are so much better on the Leapster and the games are much more fun and educational. Also the Leapster is much more intuitive, a child can pick up a Leapster and figure everything out - there is even a ""hint"" button if the child gets stuck. A child that gets stuck with the Pixter can only look at the grainy screen and wonder where they went wrong. This toy is not worth the money."
3,Color Pixter is O.K.,Color Pixter is fun. I have the game Dino Draw. Some of the games have helped me with spelling and numbers.
3,"After 10 months, Pixter DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE!","My 7 year daughter got the purple pixter as a Christmas gift in 2003. Now less than 1 year later the game doesn't work - it just plays the intro screen and music no matter what you touch with the stylus. Any game cartriges used do the same thing - the intro screen PLUS the basic pixter intro music overtop! It's not the pen because the game ""bleeks"" when touching an icon, it just doesn't DO anything different. How Sad since my daughter loves this game and she may be getting more games for it for Christmas! And how can we return a gift after a YEAR? Plus the Website has ZERO info on troubleshooting, only a contact number for Fisher price."
4,Great for My 3 yrs old,I wasn't sure about this at first. It was a Christmas gift and she has not put it down. She really loves it. At first I had to help her but after about 10 minutes she was on her own. She loves to save the pictures she makes and then show them off.
2,"Pixter color nice idea, if it would work","Purchased a purple color pixter system from a retail giant and of course spent the extra money for a color game. The game worked for about 20 minutes just fine then started making funny sounds that were not caused by anything we were doing. After the game completely quit then the pixter would not work anymore either. Replaced the batteries twice and recalibrated the stylus twice. Nothing...wouldn't work at all. It will only come on and get you to the little check points for the stylus then nothing. Any suggestions please help...otherwise...taking it back to store and game and getting a GBA SP, then at least my daughter will have something to play with on our travels. Overall...My 7 yr old daughter nor myself or husband were impressed with the pixter even when it did work. p.s. Same day I took back Barbie software the store clerk told me they had 3 others returned the same day for the same reason."
4,Great Toy,"We have had our pixter for almost a year now with no problems. We have both the color and black and white, my then 2 & 3 year olds became quite proficient at it very quickly and we are now looking at the V smile pocket or the Pixter w/video from Santa for this year. It is a great educational product that keeps them busy on car rides and trips to the bank. My only complaint is that it runds a little slow, and graphics could really be improved. (kids songs or mp3's would be nice too)"
5,Mary without dogmas,"In this polemic book, Fr. Tissa (one of the principal thinkers of the Feminist Theology), seek for the original Mary, the mother of Jesus. The search was centered in the Gospel, especially on the ""Magnificat"", with that the author tried to scape from all the thoughts that the european tradition add to the Mary image. Polemic, strong and clear, this book will show you a new Mary, closer to the reality, the poors and the liberation struggle."
4,Leica Digital Adaptor 2,"Leica Digital Adaptor 2 for Leica Televid (42303)Excellent product, but way overpriced. Excellent merchant."
3,disappointed,adapter was shipped to me in unacceptable condition. it was not assembled properly from leica. i needed to have a tool maker assemble it properly. the only reason i kept it was the fact that it is not easy to acquire one on the market place .leica quality control was asleep.
4,good but answers need proofed,This book has good subject matter but the answers at the end of the chapter have had some typos.
2,"Dry, really dry and computer based? forget it","OK, I admit that bookkeeping and accounting are generally perceived as dry subjects, but this was a Really boring read (-1 star)I don't find fault with the content, although some examples weren't very clear, it was straightforward and explained a lot of concepts and covered a full accounting cycle (+4 stars).The book's claim to introduce computer-based accounting is a total handwave. They basically mention it and spend two pages explaining computer concepts in general, nothing specific to accounting with a computer. That was really disappointing (-2 stars)."
1,Find a different book...,"Just received this book and I already question the integrity of the information. On chapter 2, it has such a major typo that I can't believe it got to printing. Where there should be a + sign there is a number 1, and where there should be an = sign there if a number 5. So the basic accounting equation reads A 5 L 1 E. Did I get the only book printed like this, since no other reviews allude to this? I hope I get my money back."
4,If you need to know about the basic of bookkeeping that is the book you want to buy.,It is written very simple so everyone can understand it.Gives you all the basics.Has many excercise and answers so you can practise.If you have a small business and want to know the basics you will like this book.
4,Good for Book Covers,"I bought these to put a notice on gift shop copies of my works that I had signed those particular books. The books are paperbacks, and these labels went on easily, slipped off to be repositioned and back on without showing bends or wear. I was very pleased with the ""Removable"" aspect as they left no gum and held up nicely. I also appreciated the ease of using Avery 6460 to enter into templates and find a set up that worked for my project.I would have liked different colors and size options for this product."
3,Exquisite Book,"Familiar and classic passages, as well as unusual poetry are placed between beautiful illustrations of antique roses. The book feels very feminine, Victorian and is romantic. The pages are scented delicately, but the fragrance is lasting."
1,Swaddled Julia,"Disappointed that the image presented in the Amazon ad shows the skinless version and when I received my figure it was swaddled ? I really wanted the skinless version. Now in order to see the skinless julia, I have to open the box, which I don't want to do. As a collector of figures the entire pristine package to me is really nice."
1,Have you ever trudged uphill in the mud during a rainstorm wearing sandals with the wind in your face.,"You would know exactly how it feels if you read this book. Somehow I slogged through until the end. Have you ever seen a person with a concussion get up and ride a horse? Or our hero, deathly ill from his wounds, assists our concussed heroine to his home where she then fights an experienced warrior for his hand and WINS! OK, I'll give our author some room, this is after all a fantasy. But for my money save your dollars and buy something else."
5,Really nice Summery Song,"This Artist has a very nice voice, His music is kinda like a clash of Old Skool meets New School."
1,"What? Am I really awake??? Como se dice ""Neurosuppressant""?","Banal - what kind of chronic early-childhood trauma birthed this monstrosity? You need to fire your editor. Oh, that's you. Do it anyway. You paint a nice picture of a disjointed psychology with what appear to be personal narcissisms and idiomorphic obsessions that profilers love to see. Your fixation on dogs over children is especially telling. Do you have much experience digging in crawl spaces???Gee, the hero survives after he leads all his buddies to their meaningless deaths... Prozac, Lithium, et al - post haste. 9x45jlM112"
1,fantasy for the totally bored,"too many side trips. the story didn't flow. maybe this program would work in the movies, but not in a book. it made me want to jump around from chapter to chapter, trying to see where I left off. ok for a first book, but not a seasoned professoinal."
4,A fast read. Plenty of action with a unique twist.,"I really enjoyed this book. Kirt Ives is reminiscent of ""Dirk Pitt"" the main character of Clive Cussler's series. I could not put it down and could suspend my disbelief of fantastic events, which is what you want in a high action suspense novel. I look forward to more adventures of Kirt Ives."
1,"Mildly amusing, pretty unbelievable. -more like 1/2 star.","The concept is good, but the characters and plot could use more development. There are a lot of typos, and grammer errors. The so called ""suporise ending"" was very disapointing. The story was a bit unbelievable. I know it's fiction, but come on. . . I'd like to see more inter-character development. One paragraph just doesn't do it. This Ives guy. . . the whole sequence about the trip down to the boat was quite monotonous. I almost stopped reading it right there. It lent nothing at all to the plot. Work on the characters, and change the ending. TE"
1,Very poor indeed,"Simply put this product is a load of woash. Broke out of the box, extremely poor craftsmanship, but what do you expect these day for 20 bucks?"
1,Surprised at poor quality of Master Lock,I was really surprised at the poor quality of this Master Lock product. It is next to impossible to get this thing locked with only two hands. It just doesn't want to snap together. It appears that the locking mechanism inside the hole is not opening all the way to let the end of the bar to be inserted. (in other words I can't get it to lock without a LOT of effort) I'm considering sending it back.
2,It rusted after a month of using trailer in salt water.,Well I thought it is marine grade. Apparently it is not. Should be ok for fresh water.
4,Seems like a decent lock,"Bought this for my newly aquired jet boat trailer. Its kind of long for a tongue lock, looks funny on the trailer, but gets the job done. I dont think it would take a huge amount of force to break this off if someone really wanted to steal the boat, but its a semi decent deterrant."
3,Lonely Among Us,"While passing through a gaseous space anomoly, the Enterprise accidently picks up a being, which is part of the anomoly. The being passes through several different people, to the ship's computer, and fianlly to Captain Picard, in its efforts to be returned home."
3,A diversity of views all lead the same way,"Good roundup of various authors views/experiences with UFOs from the era of 1990/2 - put in good (non Americanised) English. Although not Tim's best work it gives such a diverse set of viewpoints it is thought provoking and with Tim's excellent final chapter, cannot be overlooked by any keen ufologist."
2,average at best,"This book was average at best. If your new to the subject matter you'll probobly enjoy it but I didnt find too many things in the book that I hadnt read somewhere else first. I would also like to make a disclaimer, this book is advertised on Amazon as being written by Timothy Good, THAT IS NOT THE CASE. Mr. Good edited this book, and did not write it. If you are a fan of Mr. Good's books you will know shortly after opening it that the writing style and quality is no where near what he would produce. If your looking for books written by Mr. Good to add to your collection, pass this one by, its not worthy of sitting on the shelf next to his classics on the subject of UFO's."
3,"Bottle Imp is good, but give the rest a miss.","A relatively obscure work from Stevenson, I figured I'd give it a try. The Bottle Imp is a pretty good tale. The remaining three tales, I rank as follows:Markheim: Kinda dull.Ollala: Blah! Sucky-McSuck!Thrawn Janet: Not bad, but nothing to write home about.The writing is good, but the plots are sorely lacking. If I could divide up my ranking, I'd give The Bottle Imp 4 stars (I liked it), and the rest of the tales 2. Hence, my compromise on 3. All in all, you could give most of this a miss."
1,Very Disappointed,"With all the great reviews, I thought once again I would try something to help my nails grow. I applied the cream 3 to 4 times a day. I even took my polish off, hoping that would help. My nails are now more of a mess than when I started. I am truly disappointed."
5,Barielle Nail Strengthener Cream,I would not be without this product. I have used it for 20 years and it stops splitting and peeling nails. Great on toenails too...
5,Easy success: strong nails,"This nail strengthener cream is so good I have actually gifted it when complimented on my nails.Smooth, odorless... just rub it on using your index finger tip, no applicator. Easy even when traveling.Good nails not only enhance your appearance, but actually protect your fingers... go for it!"
2,Did not work for me,I tried this for several months and it did not do much to strengthen my nails. I switched to Sally Hansen Nail Serum and saw improvement within a week.On the plus side this is a nice feeling cream and the jar lasts a really long time. It just didn't work for me.
2,There's a a much cheaper version of the same thing,"This stuff WORKS - SO WELL. I was given some as a gift and I love it. However, it is functionally the same asMane 'n Tail Hoofmaker Hand & Nail Therapy, where you will get 6 oz for $3.29. That's right - six times as much product for a quarter of the price. It works just as well - if not better - it smells better, and it gives you that same awesome feeling on your hands.Don't waste your money on this stuff :-\"
5,Restored my formerly fakes nails to lovely real ones!,"I have used this product (along with the growth activator) for about a month now, and I have to say I am VERY happy with the results. I wore acrylic nails for at least 5 yrs. and then gels for about the same amount of time. I wore fake because I thought my natural nails were too weak, and they did literally bend like paper. Not good. Until these products!!! It's like I have someone else's hands!Yes the aplicatiion is time consuming but sooooo worth it! This product also really hellped my unruly cuticles.You will not be disapointed."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!,"How can you go wrong with panasonic? YOU CAN'T! They are the best electronic producers around, in my opinion. This little card is great. I use it in my GPS to store maps...fast upload, there is no drag time. It's storage capacity is great too, I've got 6 different maps saved on it, of two to four states at a time. It's a great product and a really great price! I will forever buy panasonic, forget the other guys...if you want reliability and confidence, buy panasonic."
3,Compatibility problem,After reading how good this sd card is I find it doesn't work with my Pentax Optio. I find out the high speed card is not compatible with my Optio S5i. I would like information that would include what products it can work with or how to tell if it's right before purchase. Anyway I'll have to see what other electronics will accept the panasonic sd card since it's not defective.
5,Atende ao que preciso,"Estou usando essa memória com uma máquina de 4 megapixels e permite gravar mais de 100 fotos.Pode parecer pouco para a capacidade de memória dos cartes atuais, mas o preo justifica."
5,Fast excellent SD card,I have used this card for well over a year with my digital camera. It captures images really fast. I have not had even one occasion where the card malfunctioned or behaved in a slow or unpredictable manner. Absolutely trust worthy and reliable.
2,Speedo Swimsuit with Tummy control,Nice product but does not run true to size. I needed to downsize one size and still feel the product is larger than it should be.
4,Sizing is off,"So I read that this suit runs small so I purposely got a larger size. For some reason the 'one size too big' is too short for my torso, and I'm only 5'5"". I'll have to return it. Don't do what I did though, which is buy it from [...]. They told me they have no ""exchange policy"" and that I have to buy the replacement at full price even though I got mine on sale, and that return shipping is $6! It may cost more to buy from Amazon, but if something doesn't fit, at least you have some assurance about making exchanges."
4,Nice!,"Around the time I was 4 months pregnant, I started getting nervous about stretch marks. I saw this product and was was, admittedly, wooed by the celebrity endorsements. I bought a bottle and decided to give it a go. This oil absorbs fairly quickly, but I always gave a few minutes after applying to allow it to soak into my skin. It has a light, pleasant odor and softens skin. It really helped with the itchiness. I recently ran out and got a different brand (mama mio) and have noticed an increase in itchiness - I'm thinking of picking up another bottle of Basq.Only time will tell if this actually keeps the stretch marks at bay, but it sure does soften the skin."
3,Guess what?,"After reading the reviews on these wrenchs, chose this one cause most said it worked.Well changed the oil on the Tundra and guess what, to big, slipped on the cap.So what do you do when your under your truck with no oil in it? Can't send it back, can't go Auto Zone?Its slipping so ya Duck Tape it! Lined the inside of wrench with a strip of tape and it worked like a champ!"
3,Used not new,"I ordered these labels because they are hard to find...who really uses 3.5"" disks?? I have a template set up and use them for plan reviews for my business. When these came it was obvious the package had been opened...no big deal. It appears that the labels may have been scavenged from other half-used packages and used to create this package. The accurate number of sheets were included. Some were a bit wrinkled but they still feed through my printer. They will work my use. I would not order anything from this seller that had to be brand new, first class as I believe their advertising and product discription to be misleading."
3,Almost all there,"It took over a week to receive and the packages were open (non sealed) with missing sheets, 21 out of 25 and labels off several sheets."
5,Name tha singer....PLEASE,"PLEASE SOMEONE SEND ME AN EMAIL..AND LET ME KNOW WHO DID THE FEMALE VOCALS ON THE SONG ""COME BACK TO ME"" IT IS HAUNTING ME I KNOW THAT VOICE BUT SHE WAS GIVEN CREDIT ON THE INSERT OR THE CD SEND AN EMAIL TO terryman@localnet.com IF YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW...THANKS TO ALL....FREESTYLE FOREVER...!!!!!!"
4,Great for the price!,"I have had my trailer for 2 years now and have liked it. It rides well and has fit my children plus a few extras in the back.I have also used it a lot in the stroller mode for 2 kids. It's been pretty good for that, though going up curbs is a pain because the front wheel doesn't follow very well. The other stroller complaint is the handle is difficult to keep in place. I have to re-tighten it quite a bit since it moves up or down. But that has not stopped me from taking it all over town.There are a few weird design issues. The main one is with the arm of the trailer-- it rides so that the trailer sticks out farther on one side while you're riding it (not so fun if you're going over bumpy terrain or through a skinnier spot on the road). It also leans a lot on the hinge of the arm, so we've had to re-bend it and add more padding to that part to keep it rolling straight.But, for the price, we have gotten so much use out of it and it's still working!!"
3,Not enough info,This is a good book for a green v dubber. There isnt enough info in this book to build your own hot vw with out buying other books also. You could with a little talent put an engine together as described here but it probably wont run or run well as there is no mention of how to set up carburetors here only a heavy emphasis on weber and dellorto carbs. If you are on a budget then this book is not for you as it has no mention of how to modify solex carbs or how to adapt them for a little more power etc. Somethings in this book directly contradict things the author mentions in his other book VW aircooled engine intercgange manual so which is correct? confusing
2,Not suggested,"The assembly was pretty sloppy, I had to make a visit to the hardware store to buy some additional wood screws to actually make the thing stable. The balls have a great tendacy to stop inbetween the men so one has to continually flick the ball back into play (I have ordered some new foosballs, which will hopefully help this). The unit looks nice, but the play is disappointing."
5,"Great modern chair, great price","This is a great chair. Clean modern lines. The best price I could find on the web. Of course, it is not the most comfortable chair. I bought it to match another chair I have. I was disappointed to realize that this stitching on this chair is white, whereas the stitching on my other chair was black. Nothing a little dye couldn't fix. It looks great."
3,As if you had the musicians in your own living room,An intimate show played by John Wetton (Acosutic Guitar) Geoff Downes (piano) and a cellist. It is worth seeing.
2,it did not get old well...,"there are some games that become old in a nice almost fashion way... this is not the case. the game is just a terrible graphic, really boring and dark racing guided by chance and repetition. not recommended at all."
4,Impressive...,"I have always liked Midnight Club, and when I heard that It would be available for PSP I freaked. I picked up this game right when it came out and i am not dissapointed. The graphics are amazing, and even more impressive is that EVERYTHING FROM THE PS2 VERSION IS STILL HERE. Levels, Cars, and that awesome sense of speed. The only reason i gave it four stars is that the menus move slowly. I like responsiveness and when you push select in menus It takes a second to register. The load times are always under a minute for me and they're worth it for the graphics and gameplay. I just feel that the poor menus reflect badly on the game as making it look cheaply thrown together, and i assure you, this was NOT the case. Buy it if you like: Need For Speed: Underground 2 Rivals, Wipeout Pure, Ridge Racer, or Twisted Metal. Otherwise you might not have the patience to wait for the load times."
3,"Load times suck, but it's a good game overall.","I have to agree with the other reviewers about the unusually long load times, and the somewhat skittish menus. However, this game is still a worth while purchase. The graphics are very nice and clear, gameplay is easy, and the replay value is high. I even liked to watch the intros and screen shots on this game. Sometimes you'll think that you're watching a movie not a game."
5,Wrong Game but Love it anyhow!,We received the wrong platform but have it for PS2 and my kid plays it all the time!
1,Ruined by load times,"This game looks good and is almost an exact port of the PS2 version.Unfortunately, it's destroyed by insane load times. It will often take you longer to load the race than to actually race it. Garage, dialogue, crossing the street, EVERYTHING requires a load. Only worth your time if you enjoy staring at loading screens."
3,Unbelievably close to the best game for psp,"Im first playing my midnight club game a few months ago and thinking: Wow!! Stunning graphics, absolutely humongous variety of parts and such, great races, just like, and i mean an exact match of the midnight club 3 game for playstation and xbox. Sadly, this was after the race i was taking part in taking two minutes+ to load. I mean this game is unbelievably fun and realistic (which on such a small screen is amazing), but the load times are unbearable. So unbearable that i have completely stopped playing that game since a week after i got it. It goes from best game on psp to just an average game (for me) because of the loading speed. Dont buy this game. Just hope a midnight club 4 comes out and has much shorter loading times."
1,Not worth $10,"I wouldn't pay $10 for this game - unfortunately, I paid almost $50. For me, this is the worst PSP game released to date. The graphics reek - pixelated and foggy, I was surprised at how low the quality was. This looks and feels like a PS1 game.I'll tell you how bad I think this game is ... even Need For Speed Underground Rivals, is better. That's saying a LOT.Please understand, I'm not a Midnight Club fan. If you love the franchise, I imagine you'll like this game, and hey, to each his own. But if you're a Gran Turismo fan, and you're looking for a realistic racing simulation, sad as it is, Ridge Racer for PSP is still your best bet so far."
1,bad,"slow cars ,no so much to play in the gameit is a boring game!!!I do not recommend this gamedo not buy it!"
4,Good Game,"I got this game and it is great, but it has only 1 drawback. It has a very slow load time due to the large maps. Besides that, its alot of fun."
4,fun but annoying,well this game is really fun you get to customise almost any car you get .you can also drive trucks suvs and motorcycles.the graphics are great but there is a problem.it seems if you mess up once you never are able to get into first again.so you have to start over and over until you get it down perfectly.also when your going fast it's like you have to go strait or you lose all your speed spin out and crash. altogether i have enjoyed this game
4,Midnight club dub edition,The game takes a long time to load.But i got to admit its better then the first midnight club.The only thing i would do in the first midnight club was cruis all day.but in midnight club dub edition the races are fun.Trust me get this game
3,Midnight Club,"Midnight Club 3 DUB Edition is a pretty fun game. The races are fun and challenging, there are plenty of real cars, and you can race in San Diego, Atlanta, or Detriot. The cars and races seem so slow, almost as if the cars can't even hit 80mph. The framerate is solid for the most part, but when you crash it feels totally screwed up. When turning the cars, they feel so stiff. This game is a pretty fun game, but you'd get tired of it faster than other racing games."
5,Another Winner!,"Lucy Monroe has written yet another keeper! THE ITALIAN'S SUITABLE WIFE combines the best of traditional-Presents Alpha Male with a modern sensibility that lifts it above and beyond the expected. Rico and Gianna are both strong, passionate people who find love in a thoroughly satisfying novel. And Ms. Monroe isn't shy about exploring sensitive issues such as paralysis and fertility treatments, bringing a traditional storyline into the 21st century. Give this book a try and you won't be disappointed!"
3,A Romance Junkie,"Enrico, Rico to his friends was the super rich, gorgeous Italian alpha male who saving a lady from being mugged was shot and hit by a car...already you have to love this guy. Geanna was in love with Rico since she was practically a child, and she was the first to arrive at his bedside and stayed at his bedside day and night. This was very unlike his fiance Chiara the model who stayed in her hotel sleeping. During the nights Geanna held his hand and told him how much she loved him, and it was touching. Somehow it was just flat, and I don't know why but I never warmed up to Rico. I guess it bothered me that he was engaged to that stick figure with no soul, and then he dumped her. Yes he did end up with Geanna but there was very little conflict I thought it was a little boring. I kept waiting for something to happen, but nada."
4,Would purchase from this seller again!!!,"The book's condition was exactly as listed (""like new"") which is rare in my opinion!!! I recently bought 2 books from 2 different sellers and the book's condition was listed as ""like new"" for both books and both were in horrible condition. One book was published in 2008 and was covered in little nicks and tears and this particular seller listed the book as ""like new"". The book I purchased from this seller was from 2004 and in way better condition than the 2008 book.Anyway, I would definitely purchase from this seller again!"
3,.,I'm listing this under historical-fiction because one of the leads uses a modem.You know what I liked about this book? Monroe wrote some pretty horrible archetypal couple that fans of romance always bitch about but no one really writes anymore; the totally cold and should-call-the-police-on hero and pussy heroine. It was so old school cliche that it totally came off as avant-garde to me. I knew what was going to happen but I was interested in seeing how these characters go about it.It's one of the FEW of these little romance novels I could ever finish.
1,Does not work in all cars,"This looked like a great product for my purpose. However, upon receiving the product and reading the instructions I learned that it does not work in all cars. When you turn offthe ignition it may also turn off power to the cigarette lighter socket. I had to callthe dealers of my cars (Acura and Mini) to find out that there is no power at the socketonce the ignition is off."
5,Works Fine,"This product was purchased to maintain the charge on a battery in a vehicle that is seldom driven. It works fine. Please note that it is not designed to charge a battery that is low, only maintain the charge. If you need a charger, consider a model that produces more power (watts). The unit is fairly small and has an LED to indicate it is producing power. I would buy it again."
1,NOT WEATHERPROOF,"Regardless of what the Amazon listing says (and I asked them to change it over a month ago and still haven't) this product is NOT weatherproof. When you open the package the literature about the product specifically states that it is ""not for use outdoors"". You have to pay more to get a weatherproof model."
1,broke after 3 days,"Biggest waste of cash I ever made.I set it up in the windshield of my 2007 Mazda 3, whenever I took the key out the car would make an angry alert noise until I unplugged the charger from the lighter. Then after about 3 day of this it just stopped working. Not sure if it shorted out or what, maybe I got a defective model, or maybe it's just not compatible with a 2007 Mazda3...whatever the reason, this piece of crap stopped working after only a couple of days, I feel ripped off."
5,Cruising Solution,I wish I had found this 5 years ago. It would make my quest to document my cruising time for my six pack application so much easier. So much better than a spiral notebook for keeping track of fuel and maintenance. Highly recommend it.
1,DANGEROUS,"I wish I had paid attention to the other negative reviews, but I decided to be cheap and go with this product. This morning when I woke up my entire house reeked like an electrical fire. I panicked and checked out all of the major appliances and could not find the source. Then I spotted this little bastard and decided to check it out. The adapter was incredibly hot to the touch and was ultimately the source of the fire smell. I am just glad I decided not to sleep in on this sleepy Saturday morning or else my wife and I could have ended up toasty critters since I decided to go with the cheap adapter. Nothing like potentially dying because you tried to save a few bucks."
1,Have to set to 6 volts to get 9 volts... way off it's factory settings.,"Unit arrived on time and was undamaged in the packaging. I plugged it in and measured the voltage at the 9 volt adapter plug and found that it was at 11 volts. Setting it to 6 gave me the 9 volts needed. This was both under a load setting and just testing the leads. I then tested a different reducer I had that looked the same but made by a different manufacturer and it gave the correct voltage for what the switch was set at.I didn't contact the seller, I didn't ask for a refund and I didn't give the seller a chance to make it right. I knew that I just had to set it to 6 volts to give me my 9 volts needed. Like many of us it isn't worth the time and money to repack and send back for exchange. But if you order one make sure that what your voltage setting is set for gives you what you're looking for."
1,Konica Minolta printer came broken. I would have loved it otherwise,this was a used product that came from a private seller. It was not packed correctly and was broken. I contacted the seller via e-mail and told him this... he asked me to wait to send it back to him after he sent me a shipping label. This was 2 weeks ago. I have continued to try to reach him and he has not responded. I asked for a full refund of the product and shipping cost and I have not heard a peep. The printer is useless to either him or me because the packing was so poorly done. the box it was shipped in was way bigger than it needed to be and there were no packing materials inside the box... so the printer was floating around in the box.. i'm surprised it wasn't in 50 pieces. Is there anyone at Amazon that can get this seller to contact me and send the shipping label and refund me in full???I think that it should be easier to find a phone number and name and address of seller so I could call him.
2,Short lifespan,"Although these goggles are very comfortable and the design seems innovative and smart, I've come to realize one significant flaw. The plastic nosepiece fractures after only a month or two. The nosepiece and the two eyepieces are all one unit, so once the nosepiece breaks, the goggles are useless. I bought five of these goggles. Of those, four have suffered from this defect, the nosepiece spontaneously snapping after only a few weeks of use. I do not abuse the goggles, nor is the pool water I swim in harsh. I do live in a dry climate (Saudi Arabia), and this may be a contributing factor. Either way, I'd be interested to know if others have encountered the same problem. I warn those interested in this goggle to try one pair for a few months before purchasing others. Apart from this problem, the goggles are the best I've ever used - in terms of fit, comfort and vision."
5,Superb Sausage Knife,Wusthof knife is exactly what every sausage lover should have. It is a beauty. Arrived promptly and the lucky person who received it for Christmas was thrilled.
1,very poor product,"They were great for two months and then the batteries failed and to my surprise....you cant replace them as they are soldered in. I even tried soldering new batteries, which is impossible to do. I would not recomend this product because you cannot replace the batteries, but was a nice design and looked great, what a shame."
4,I love it,"I have had these house numbers (4) for about 5 years. Only recently one of them failed. I replaced it. The size was slightly different from the original one, but I was able to snap the new part into place. I think the reviews on this site are only from the people who are not satisfied with the product. Probably the satisfied customers don't bother writing a review. If I had read these reviews before buying my numbers, I would never have bought them. I am glad I didn't read them!"
2,EZ LIGHT / SOLAR HOUSE NUMBERS,"I bought these while residing in Washington State, knowing we were destined to reside in rural Mexico. They look great, easy to operate / install. Love the RED numbers. Easily read in our dark area at night. No street lighting. The only disappointment is they DO NOT LAST! Our numerical address is three numbers. I bet we have replaced at least one every 1 - 2 months. It surely is not due to lack of sunshine here in Mexico. I may buy a couple more and that will be it. No MAS!Mr. Hawkins / In Jalisco, Mexico"
2,Single Number,I returned these numbers. I thought they came in a set of 4 so I only ordered one but I needed 2 numbers so I returned it and ordered another set. Thank you.
2,bad batteries,"The numbers themselves are fine, but the batteries are terrible, did not last a week.. I would not recommend this product until the battery situation is resolved."
3,good,one thing i did not like was thatit is showing two on display but u only get onei love it thanks
3,EZ View Solar Powered Address Number,"When these things work, they work fantastic. However, they seem to ""burn out"" after 6 months or so. I had hoped they would last longer. I've had to buy 3 replacements in about a year and a half. The pizza guys think it's the greatest invention ever. The manufacturer's claim that a few minutes of sunlight provides weeks of illumination is a flat out LIE! They WILL stay bright all night long, 10 to 12 hours. Overall, they work well enough to pay $10 for them. I wouldn't pay more than that since they have kind of a short life span."
1,I never got it,I never got it in the mail got reinbursed for it so have no preference. outdated book so can only find used. new copy is way to pricy.
3,Plasticy looking beads,"This necklace would have been very nice if not for the quality of the beads. The description calls them ""glass"", but they are very obviously plastic - they give off a purplish/iridescence in any light. I probably wouldn't have bought them had I known - I have attached some pictures to illustrate. Everything else about it is nice though - I like the wire used, adjustableness, and the dangling bead on the back (nice touch)."
2,not thrilled....,"I bought the unit because of the name - assuming that it would be a high quality product. I assumed wrong. I was originally very pleased with the unit because of it's light weight and crystal clear sound and would still be thrilled with it ~ if it still worked. Less than 3 months of very light, very tender use and the thing is garbage. The plug split at the seam when I inserted it into the jack so I repaired it with electrical tape. That worked for a time, but then the wires must have given out near the headset....crackling and intermittent voice going both ways. I have since purchased a Panasonic for 1/4 the price and it's great!"
1,not good at all,"This book had a predictable plot line and stiff characters. The reader is bashed over the head with the character's beliefs. Their Christian beliefs are, of course, good, but that was all that the characters had going for them. I would recommend this book to no one."
3,way too cheesy!!,"The authors actually had a good plotline. Actually it was an excellent storyline. But the characters are so stereotypical. You have the perfect woman whose only fault is naivete. Then you have the evil sister, the perfect hero, and the terrible villain. It would make a great old melodrama. But definitely not great fiction."
5,Hoping for a sequel!,"Dr.Hordes has made an outstanding contribution to the history of New Mexico and its, heretofore, largely unknown hispano crypto-jewish population. This watershed work provides serious scholars a benchmark from which to continue the quest to understand the history and culture of a group that was forced to hide its beliefs and practices in order to survive but who, against overwhelming odds, was still able to transmit its beliefs and practices to its descendents for over 500 years. This is truly an amazing story!"
5,To the Ends of the Earth,This book was an excellent history of the time the Jews were expelled from Spain to the present time which finds many of ther descendents lving i New Mexico and other parts of the Southwest.Many of these descendents of the Crypto Jews cling to bits and pieces of their ancient heritage while others have actively sought out information. Still others have actually undergone a conversion to Judiasm and now actively practice it.This was a very well researched and documented work.
1,? for the reader of this book?,"Does this book negate the council of nicea in 325 A.D.?Also whatever points the book proves that Christinity was never influenced by eith spritiual systems would have to be errouneously false. There's undeniable evidence that Christianity did take from other spiritual systems concepts of immortality,virgin birth, and mystery wisdom. For a more extensive research the reader should read ""Christianity Before Christ"" by John G. Jackson ""Black man of the Nile and His Family"" by Dr. Yosef A.A. Ben Jochannan., ""Golden Age of the Moor"" by Dr. Ivan Van Sertima, ""Egyptian Yoga The Philosophy Enlightenment"" by Muata Ashby. ""African Origins of Western Religions"" by Dr. Yosef A.A. Ben Jochannan."
5,just in time to play santa,got book cause i was asked to play santa just because i have a white beard. hate to disappoint kids and disillusion them so bought book to get some ideas and tips how to do it right. there were a few things that helped me so thank-you
2,I'm disappointed.,"When I first got my copy of this book, I noticed that it was alot smaller than I thought it would be. It was made like a children's book. There was'nt very much writing in it. The pictures in it were nice, though. I was hoping that this book would be an instructional teaching book about how to be a Santa Claus. I was very disappointed and I'm sending it back to the company where it came from."
2,Practically useless,"This is a cute little book, but if you're really interested in learning to be a Santa, save your money. It's nothing more than a cute little book. It is practically useless if you're looking for information on ""How to be Santa Claus."""
2,"OK, here's the deal...","The Motels (all complete live performances)1. Closets & Bullets2. Total Control3. Anticipating4. KixHeart5. Magic Man (live vocal, band not live)6. Barracuda (totally lip synched)Bonnie Tyler7. It's A Heartache (live vocal to a backing track, only a couple minutes long)Suzi Quatro8. If You Can't Give Me Love (live vocal, band not live)9. Tear Me Apart (different, later appearance, live performance, fades out)Rent it, don't buy it. It costs too much for what you get."
3,HEART: ¡Fans Only!...,"The thing about this DVD is that unfortunately there are only two songs of HEART, Why they had to share the time running and the credits with another regular bands? ( to this day, the most important band in this DVD is HEART. Isn't it?):1. ""Magic Man"" (A great live performance from '76, with original band members) and2. ""Barracuda"" ( A playback performance with original band members).Is a real document for Heart fans; although it's very few time for an important band like this. Why not the complet concert presentation?... There is in the market 4 or 5 CD compilations of the group, but none (in DVD format) about the starting carer of the Wilson sisters. WHY?... Good Luck!"
3,Great clips but needs more,"I enjoyed this video of rare footage from some of my favorite 70's bands like Humble Pie, Alice Cooper, and Badfinger but the entire video only last 30mins. It would be nice to see 3 or 4 songs from each band and extra footage like interviews if possible. I would like to see more stuff like this released on 70's bands."
2,"BEST OF MUSIKLADEN ""LADIES OF ROCK""","THIS ONE WAS A DISSAPPOINTMENT - THREE GOOD SONGS, 2 BY THE GROUP ""HEART"" AND ONE BY ""BONNIE TYLER"" -"
5,Mesmerizing story,"Saving Elijah captivated me from the prologue. Dorf's transitions between present and past events are seamless. The tension builds gradually and the suspense holds the reader. Dorf offers a unique and insightful twist on the concept of what lengths a mother would go to to save her child. Through the voice of Dinah, the mother, Dorf explores ideas of theology, anticipatory grief, futile care, and the way our past shapes us and attempts to dictate our future. She avoids the easy cliches and offers a thought-provoking look into the complex relationship between mother and ill child."
1,Not a good course,"I bought this today at the local bookstore and returned it within a few hours. We are moving to the Czech Republic so I have to learn Czech, but this course is awful! The lessons are not structured very well and I do not like the way it is recorded between the narrator and the Czech speaker. I don't think the way they do the conversations is very helpful either. I am sure I could learn something eventually, but it would require a lot of extra effort pouring through the book and repeating the conversations too many times to get anything useful."
4,No side effects,"I have taken multis in the past (stresstabs, rainbow, centrium, one a day) and they all made me tired or anxious. These havent given me any of those side effects. I don't take the crazy recommended dose though (2-4 a day?!), just one a day. I highly recommend eating after you take these, as any vita-burps from them are awful."
5,Great vitamin!,"I have been taking this vitamin for over 2 months now and it has been great. I have noticed an improvement in my ability to focus on tasks (one of the ingredients in choline) and during periods of high stress when I typically get sick, I have not since being on Life Force. I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Great price,This is a very comprehensive multi-vitamin at a great price.Read the vitamins and minerals that it contains and you willbe impressed.
1,"Moldy (?), spotted capsules",Many of the capsules had black spots on the outside of them. Many of the capsules were also stuck together where the black spots were located. I had to discard about half the bottle. Very disgusting.
3,Not really sold on this product...,"Based on the description of this product, I expected to feel a difference between this multivitamin and my regular Target generic vitamin. I have to say, I really didn't notice anything different. I'm sure this works wonders for some, but for me it really did nothing. My husband won't take it because of the smell...kind of a fishy smell to the vitamins that lasts with you all day long--especially if you belch!"
5,Vitamin burps,"The only bad thing about these vitamins is the same bad thing about all vitamins: Sometimes, you'll swallow the vitamin, but it will get stuck in your throat, and no matter how much water you drink, it stays stuck in your throat. Consequently, whenever you burp, it smells like vitamins. No one likes that smell.Would purchase again."
4,Life Force Multiple,Good product. Increases energy and decreases hunger because all the necessary vitamins are provided.
4,"Hard to really tell but I ""feel"" safer","Hard to really tell with vitamins if they are doing their job. I did not get the ""More energy"" or ""I can tell they are working"" moments after taking these. But I work out and eat healthy and use these to make sure I am getting everything I need in my diet. They are rated really well, just search for reviews on Google, and they are right in the sweet spot for price.I am on my second bottle and will probably stick with these until reviews change."
5,Excellent!,"Never had a vitamin that actually made me feel different, but oh wow! I fall asleep quicker (no more Ambien for me), wake up refreshed, memory and concentration are much improved and more energy than I've had in years! These rate as one of the best (for good reason) and the cost is very affordable for me. This is the first ever product evaluation I've ever given and I am recommending them to all of my friends!"
3,wanna pee green?,"Alright, so like the title says...... but yeah, besides that, I'm not quite sure what it is these guys are doing for me, hence the 3-star rating. They also smell pretty crappy (but i've been told that's a common problem with all vitamins) & can give you acid reflex."
3,"OK, but not all that","Was really expecting an energy ""boost"" as I am used to with a high quality vitamin. I have taken 8 a day for several weeks with no noticable increase in energy or decrease in fatigue. I am going back to my old brand, also a whole food source vitamin. It really makes a differance in my energy level, I had just thought I would try something a little differant."
1,Not impressed,Not impressed with this product. You have to take 8 pills a day. OMG for realy. NOT!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want a natural source please don't buy this one.
1,Warning - Dangerous,"The CucinaPro 295-01 Tea Spot Electric Kettle is dangerous and could start a fire. We are lucky it didn't start a fire in our kitchen.We kept this kettle on a free standing counter where the steam could not damage anything above it. This week every time we used it, it smelled like burning plastic. We couldn't see anything wrong with it, although we thought maybe a small piece of plastic had broken off and fallen into the heating unit. Today my husband turned it over and looked at the bottom of it, and it was completely burnt through in the area under the burner It is a good thing for us that we had it setting on granite. If it had been setting on a different type of counter, it could have burnt it or started a fire.We would estimate we used this kettle for no more than seven months total."
5,Me Too!,"Of all the many talented performers born in the year of my birth, Fritz Wunderlich must stand very high on the list. Here with Herman Prey, and Hans Hotte, we have a trio of voices which create a truly memorable performance. The rest of the featured cast rises to the occasion with superb results. Agreeing with the details of the two major reviewers, I add only that, I too, find the black and white somewhat distracting but the positive overall so outweighs the fault that I can recommend this DVD as the second to whichever of the fine contemporary performances you might choose as your example of how a classic should look on screen today."
1,Disgusting,"This book was old, which I didn't mind, but it was yellow pages, and the pages were dirty!Had a hard time even holding the book, as it was disgusting for the price.I would like my money back actually, as it was not worth the money I spent, plus the postage it cost to have it sent to me. You should not send out a product like this."
5,Very pleased!,"This book was purchased as a gift for my mother-in-law and her friends who are fans of the author. They had read the author's other books in this series but could not find this title which was out of print. Amazon offers a great way to find good condition, out of print books at very reasonable prices!"
4,good escape,"Her characters are just a little too good to be true but the reading is good for a quick no thought escape. I enjoy historical, fact based novels and though these are almost too sweet they do offer real history."
1,The books assumes readers are morons with learning diability,"The book focuses on shortcuts which do not work, especially with data sufficiency section of gmat quantitative assessment. There is no subsitute for learning the simple basics and skills required to deal with the GMAT questions. The only coaching material I found useful was the one offered by the Educational Training Services. This manual focuses on skills, and actually helps students develop skills required to deal with the GMAT assessment areas competently, and with great success."
4,The THC book,If you want to know about THC then this is the book to get about just that. Be warned! This is heavy on the chemistry and is mostly devoted to that science and so if you do not know much about chemistry then you may only get the benefits from the sections on processing and potency.
5,Need it,"You need lots of technical/clinical books if you're prescribing Medicinal Marijuana.We do, so we need the books, to combat the feds"
1,I had trouble caring,"Populated by dull, plodding characters that act with accord to some ""deep,"" ""profound"" message Link seems to be trying to get across rather than rationality, Magic For Beginners is simply pointless. Link builds up these characters and then pokes casual fun at then for about 20 pages until she just gives up on them with nothing resolved. There's no magic here, only delusions and strangeness for the sake of strangeness."
2,Not satisfying,"A number of the stories in this book do not have satisfying endings. In one story in particular, I feel like the author got lazy and left off 2/3 of the way through. I had high expectations for this book and they were not met. Parts of this book were fun and imaginative, but a lot of it was annoying. I do not recommend this book at all."
4,Pleasant and interesting,This collection was an interesting and agreeable read. Link has original ideas and felicitous turns of phrase; her work reminds me very much of Angela Carter and to some extent M John Harrison and J G Ballard. Possibly the early Tanith Lee as well. Certainly worth reading.
2,Waste of time,Definitely not a children's book.I have no idea who recommended this to me or where I found this title. But I loved the first short story and then was quite disappointed with most of the rest.
5,Wow!!! I was so impressed by this surprise third book,"Applause to Norton and Lackey!!! Hurrah!!! i fell in love with the elevenbane back in the summer of '95, and have been stuck ever since, and when i learned of this third installment i couldn't wait to read it, to see what shana, lorryn, and company were up to. a huge credit to the authors for trying a new angle and introducing a whole new set of characters to the sage of the halfbloods. while it did start alittle slow, only really the first two or three chapters, i jumped right in and was quickly sucked deeper into the mysterious world of the elvenlords and the secrets they wanted to stayed hidden. i won't tell the ending, but i will say that the dynamics used on the characters were quite a change, but very welcomed, to breathe new life into them, to really see the dimensions of the characters and the world in which they lived in. kudos!!!"
3,Mundane,"Although this book does in fact revisit likeable characters, there is very little character development. The budding romance between shana and lorryn is of no surprise and caillach gwain is, as always, a menace. This book spends entirely too much time expounding upon the nuances of elven politics and explicating the intricacies of magical spells. The main character, Kyrtian, may be a military genius but that doesn't prevent him from being as dull to the reader as he is to the other elves. All in all, there is very little action involved and a dissapointing lack of plot. One gets the feeling that authors were trying to make a few bucks by fluffing up the series rather than releasing a well- thought-out install ment to the series. I expected more. Three stars."
4,Great story,"I bumped into this series a few years back, and found the first two books extremely enjoyable. This new book continues a great tradition and really read well. The first half of the book provided some pleasant character development and switches to the familiar characters mid-way through the book. Overall the story is good, but you will appreciate the story much better if you read the books in sequence. The only drawback was that the ending of the book appears a bit rushed and open ended for a sequel."
4,Love this genre,"I loved this book! The characters are nicely developed and the fantasy characters are amazing. The only problem i have is that Andre Norton has passed away and I can't find any info on the next book in the series. Mercedes Lackey has reported on her blog that there will be more, but I don't see anything on the horizon. I hate to wait forever for a resolution to the series!"
2,It is as it is.,"This is a typical Tolle CD. He doesn't come across well by recorded voice, whereas his DVD's are better at transmitting the essence of presence.It is about ""practicing presence"" as the title says. However, he does not go into details about how to teach this to others except through living example. Tolle even makes a joke of the fact that he isn't ""teaching"" a method or technique. A classic non-dual evasion of responsibility.Basically, it's an okay set if you know presence (which is scintillating ever-nowness) but even then, why bother? It's not worth it if you want some concrete suggestions to help others awaken."
3,"The book was very confusing, but well-written.","Pudd n'Head Wilson was a well written book, and I enjoyed it somewhat. I like the plot of the book. It came of big interest to me. It was like no other book I have read. Although, it was well-written, it was very complicated and confusing because of the language Mark Twain used. It was not his fault because that is how people used to talk. I would not recommend this book to a young one, or someone who is not advanced in their reading class. This book is not as popular as I thought it would be. It was not one of my favorite books, but I will recommend this book to young adults and adults who like to know about the past, but also like a little laugh in between the plot."
1,Puddinhead Wilson,"This book was so boring. I had to read it for school, and I was not impressed! It was so slow, and was not one of Twain's best. I definatly don't recommend this for kids or adults. DON""T READ PUDDINHEAD WILSON!"
3,Interesting read,The book was in good condition. The text was accurate. I did not like how faint the print was on the page. The story was good. It was a little difficult to read due to a certain dialect in the text.
4,The real deal on Pudd N' Head Wilson,"I enjoyed reading Pudd N' Head Wilson. It was a little slow at times, but it made up for it, with all the mystery going on, within the novel. If you like educating yourself about slavery, and don't mind seeing the""real"", I felt for the slave mother Roxy in the novel, I'm sad that she had to make that type of life changing decison for her, and her son. As well as Tom, and if it had been me,then I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing. I look foward to reading other books, but the infamous Mark Twain."
4,Great Story for all ages,"Pudd'nhead Wilson is a great story that can be read by those of all ages. For a book that was written over a hundred years ago, it is amazing to see all of the aspects that make todays books and movies so great; a murder, a great court scene, thrilling dectective work, a switched birth, and overall an ironic and surprising ending. Its not a long book and it can be read in one or two sittings. The social overtones in this book also really make you think about race relations today. Twain is a fablous author and although this book is not as great as Huck Finn, if you loved that as I did, you will certainly enjoy Puddn'head Wilson"
3,WATCH OUT,The season one disk one works for the most part. After awhile it will start to skip. However the second disk does not that one works fine. The only thing is the disk. I only had one problem and then amazon fixed it. The show is great. There are some pretty cute guys on the show. More than likely you can connect with one of the characters.
5,Season one,I can't wait for this to come out! It maybe not be the best season but its still awesome!Now us american viewers will be able to see everything the N edited out because they thought it would &quot;Offend Americans&quot;CANNOT WAITWee!
4,Addictive,"Some of the young actors on Degrassi are extraordinarily talented (Ryan Cooley, Stacey Farber, Jake Epstein), and we will be seeing them for decades to come. The boys on the show need to comb their hair. I don't understand the hairstyles of the Canadian youth. The show is highly addictive. I haven't watched a kid's show since the Mickey Mouse Club with Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling, and Christina Aguilera. Some of the kids on Degrassi will be just as big in a few years."
4,this show is great (this is the worst season though)...,"but the special fts. are pretty cool and c'mon, how can you NOT love this show? it's my biggest T.V. guilty pleasure next to Noah's Arc."
5,Degrassi: TNG,"This is an awesome show! When I first heard of it, I thought it was going to be stupid, but it's not. The 3rd and 4th seasons are the best, but season 1 isn't too bad."
5,Viva la Degrassi,"I go to high school in New York, and it is nothing like Degrassi High, to say the least...which is why I think this is the most brilliant show on television. It's the trashiest guilty pleasure out there that gives me that gossip craving I desperatly desire. I don't think I know anybody or have heard of anybody that has been raped who is also friends with somebody with an abusive boyfriend that put her in the hospital thats friends with a gay guy with curiously homophobic friends. I probably never will. I've never been to Canada so I don't know, it could be different there. But all I can say is that Degrassi gives me all the drama I could possibly need and I think it's the best teen drama out there."
5,Degrassi Rox my sox ;-),at first i never watched degrassi my friend did and one night i stayed at her house and the every episode ever marathon was on and i really liked the show so i started watching it i havent yet seen them all so this dvd rox and i cant wait for it now i just need to talk my mom into buying it for me lol (did you know there are 2 episodes the us has never seen and they will be on like the season 3 dvd it is about manny (she is pregnant w/ craigs baby)and only canada and austrailia got to see it(it is call Accidents will happen Part 1 and part 2 wow)
4,"Not a teen, but likes this show otherwise...","I can't believe I actually became a fan of this show but I have. I have to admit I find it a little entertaining. It's a show that I can watch with my little brother and remember the things I went through in middle school and high school (and can deal and sympathize with the things he's going through now). I know some may say that the show only perpetuates stereotypes and cliches, but let's be honest. That's pretty much all real life is anyway. It isn't cutting edge everyday, so what's the big deal? I think the show is pretty good and I can't wait to get this DVD set. Now me and my siblings can enjoy this show anytime we want to."
4,Pleased with purchase,"I got the case similar to this one that says it only carries 4 dolls and was red. After looking at the black one the cases are identical except for the outer color and design. My 7 year old absolutely loves it and had no problem fitting the 8 dolls she has into it as well as the accessories. The case is only designed to hold but so much, so of course you will not get every outfit possible into it. Regardless it serves it's intended purpose."
2,this is great,"this is great, my friend has this and tons of bratz(the whole set) it can fit way more then 4 bratz and whenever she comes over she just takes all her bratz in this this is a great deal for girls who love bratz and enjoy playing wth them."
3,not durable,"I bought this organizer not to long ago, and it is already falling apart! Whenever I put the clothes into the pouches , the seeming along the velcro rips! Now the pouches are even starting to rip. This case is not for someone with alot of bratz, if you do I suggest buying 2."
2,How organized is this?,I put in 5 stars because it teaches children to be organized. I have 8 dolls and soon ill have ten but this is preety good. The problem is that it doestnt close up! Before i got this i had to put my doll clothes inside a plastic bag so i still think this is preety good. Especially if you have plenty of bratz clothes. I think that everyone should get this so your stuff wont be scattered and un organied.
2,Not recipe cards but greeting cards,"I thought I was getting a box of recipe cards but, in fact, it was a box of greeting cards. I looked at the ad in Amazon again and it is not all that clear. I wouldn't have ordered them if I had known what they were. I'll use them, but not what I was expecting at all."
1,This is not a book!,"I ordered this thinking it was a book. Funny, it was listed under the book catagory, but its not a book. Its a box of 12 note cards, 4 different kinds, 3 of each. This is the first time I have been disappointed with an Amazon order. Don't waste your money."
1,Why haven't I received my book?,I have still not received this book even though I ordered it a month ago.What's up?
5,Everything you ever wanted to know about pool!,"There is just not enough to say about Byrnes, if you ""think"" you know how to play poo, read this book anyway, you will learn more then you ever imagined!A great teacher with great information!"
3,A great starting place,"This is a good book to start from when considering building a wireless community or WISP. Though a bit dated, all the concepts explored are still valid (802.11b isn't obsolete, just not used as often as the ubiquitous 802.11g)."
4,Very Practical,"This is one of the most practical technical books I read. It covers all aspects that should be considered for wireless community networks, not only in regards to wireless (like db loss and stuff) but also some networking aspects like NAT.Good description of some of the largest wireless communitie in the US as well."
4,"Good overview, but assumes you're technical","Rob's book provides a fine overview of the newly emerging phenomenon around building wireless LANs. Indeed, you read this book and walk away thinking ""I can do that!""But unless you're a relatively tech-savvy engineer, or familiar with or able to grasp complex technology, you'll be frustrated that this phenomenon is not ready for prime-time.O'Reilly often publishes books about topics that are a year or two ahead of the ""mass market"" adoption. They certainly did so with the Internet back in the early-to-mid '90. So with that in mind, I recommend reading this book -- even if you're not in a position to build your own WLAN -- so you'll be a couple of steps ahead when everyone starts deploying/using wireless LANs."
1,The format is a mess,"Please note that the 1 star tha I give is for the kindle version, not the book itself. I cannot rate the content of this book, because the format of this book is so mess up, it made reading very difficult. I never notice that how important the layout and formatting of a book to the reading experrience. Don't buy it."
2,Doesn't stay on the ear,"Good sound and all that, but how can on hear anything if it doesn't stay on the ear. Bad design, too big heavy and clunky without a tilt to the microphone so it just hangs there by the neck and shortly afterwards the whole thing falls off because it's all to heavy and badly designed. Jabra used to make a great one, but those days are gone. If we only knew then what we know now, we'd buy 3 of things that are good. Oh well. The search continues on. (By the way, I got mine for less than $20 with shipping from a different place.)"
5,a little known work of art by a great writer,"Everyone I've ever recommended this book of stories to has loved it and spent the time searching out all of Ingalls's books. Like Jonathan Carroll, her books and stories start out realistically and then slowly lead the reader to strange and unusual places with ease. Reading Ingalls is an imaginative experience that should not be missed. Her books are all short but profound."
5,Very gribbing accout of a tragic loss.,"Very gripping account. If you are a WW2 aviation ""buff"" this is a must read. It cuts away statistics and brings you into the lives of the men...youth...that fought and died. I wept at the end of the book. What a waste of our nations youth....to die at the end of the conflict on a mission that should not have been flown"
4,"Fine, with info to help you research family members KIA.","A fine story of the author's research into the facts concerning his uncle's death in a World War II bombing raid. The author obtains service records, mission histories, eyewitness accounts, and interviews battle participants to reconstruct the story of his uncle's demise.Especially valuable is the book's appendix, which lists addresses of U.S. Military and other government and private organizations which make available a surprising amount ofdetailed information about individuals' service careers and the events attending their deaths, recoveries, andpost-war ""repatriations"".This book helped me turn my own Uncle's loss over Vienna from a mere War Department telegram into a rich and interesting story, much to the surprise and satisfaction of my family.(See also, 'Or Go Down in Flame: A Navigator's Death over Schweinfurt' by W. Raymond Wood for similar content and treatment.)"
2,box was a mess and opened,i was very disappointed ... the box was faded and looked as though it had been in water.....colors were all faded.... box was not sealed....... looked as though someone had returned it..... i almost sent it back.... however i did write to you..... Elinor Goodman
5,A fabulous book!,"It is great when someone writes a book that shares information that is easy to learn and apply! What is written in this book now seems so obvious, and we wonder why it has never dawned on us before! However, if you are not a church leader, it is quite a daunting prospect to suggest to your leader that 'things could be better', and then present your leader with a solution!!But, I do agree that what has been written can become something that people will want to do when they see it put into practise from those in leadership. Everyone will willingly follow a good shepherd...Thank you Mike and Walt for this excellent book.From Michele Neal"
2,not for an adult.,"bought this for my kid's keyboard. this bent/broke the first time my husband sat on it. he is 175 pounds, one leg bent in half where it meets the other leg. we reinforced it with another piece of metal and it has been fine since. we are very handy/mechanical and know it was properly assembled. if you want it to last a long time without having to reinforce it, I would only recommend this for children and adults under 120lbs, maybe a little more."
1,Broke after two weeks of use.,The bench broke at the point where two legs cross and where the big screw inserted to adjust the height. One of the legs bent at that point and broke. I contacted the seller (Endless Variety) and we will see what happens next.Update - The seller returned the money for the broken bench by the next business day.
3,It was well received.,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law who love Christmas Story. He loved it. It was cute but small. I think the price was a bit high considering the size of the lamp.
4,Christmas Story Lamp,"If you like the movie you'll enjoy have this 20 inch lamp. If you haven't seen it yet and don't want to buy it,wait until next Christmas and you can watch it for 24 hours."
3,Smaller than expected,"I don't know if it is because I had just watched A Christmas Story when I bought this for my dad for Christmas, but when it arrived on my doorstep I literally had no idea what it could be. When i opened the box I was shocked that this lamp could fit in the little box, especially for $50. Overall I am happy with it, my dad enjoys it, but be warned 20"" is a bit smaller than you would think for a lamp. The average height for a table lamp is AT LEAST 25"", so this is a bit smaller."
4,"Small but nice replica, love the fringe!","Yes, it's small, as advertised. Yes the stockings aren't exact, and the leg doesn't extend quite as high, but those are minor quibbles. All in all it's a decent lamp, I was actually expecting something of cheaper quality than it was. The lampshade is pretty nice, and the fringe really makes it. The leg does indeed light up, but it looks like there's a rectangular shaped bulb-box inside, so it's definitely not a uniform glow -- that lost it a star on my review. But really, I'm satisfied with the purchase and my dad loves it. It's going in the window for a few days, and then into his man-cave."
4,Christmas leg lamp,"I rec'd this item in a very timely manner, however, I was a little disappointed because the box the leg lamp came in would not stay together. I had to put the lamp in another box for wrapping. The lamp itself is in good condition, and, I decided to keep the original box in hopes of repairing it. This is a gift for my son which I know he will be thrilled with."
4,A major award!!!,"It's smaller that what I invisioned, but it's a great conversational piece. You can light the leg individually from the lamp and that makes a great night light. The full size leg lamps are ridiculously over priced, so the table lamps make a good alternative at a very reasonable price. Plus, it's a major award!!!!"
2,Leg Lamp Delivery,As of today 12/18 I have not received delivery of a gift that was ordered on 12/4. It was suppose to arive by the 15th. Be forewarned you get no communication on delivery or response when you inquire why!
4,Great gag gift for GROWN-UPS!,"In reviewing this product Amazon had me rate it as a toy (educational value, etc.) which does not seem accurate. This is not a toy, but a fun joke lamp for fans of the Christmas Story movie. It is too breakable (and loaded with sexual innuendo) to be given to a child, in my opinion. And educational value... umm, I don't think so.In any case, gave it to my father-in-law for Christmas and it was a huge hit (and immediately caused a fight between him and my mother-in-law about where it will be put on display - buyer beware!). This is smaller than the true replica, but much more affordable and perfect for that Christmas Story fan who has everything."
2,Didn't work!!! Great prank though.,"I bought this as a prank Christmas gift for my mom. She got a good laugh. But when she tried lighting it up, it didn't work! My dad is an electrical engineer, so he's trying to fix it.Either way, everyone got a good laugh out of it."
4,A gift,"This is a gift for someone I know. They absolutely love the christmas story movie and I thought it would be funny to get the leg lamp for them. The box was torn and taped up, though, but wasn't bad enough for me to want to return it. I just hope it works. Package came on time and from what I can tell, is exactly what I ordered."
3,Christmas Story lamp,This was a gift for my mother-in-law and she just loved it! I would have to say that it was not made very well. The lampshade does not fit properly and it tilts. Also found it at Walgreen's for a lower price and no shipping charge. Never thought to look there.
4,loved it,item was a little smaller than I had envisioned but nonetheless the recipient was happy. The lamp only takes 5watt max bulb and I'm having a difficult time locating one with a regular size.base.
4,leg lamp,gave this as a birthday gift to my sister. she loves the movie. my husband and I also built a wood crate to put the lamp in and it was a great gift. The pictures of her facial expressions are priceless. the lamp itself is very authentic. good purchase..
3,"Christmas story lamp 20""","well, the metal wire of the shade on the lamp was bent significantly. unfortunately, it was a gift & almost Christmas, so no time to send it back. We did the best we could in bending it back into shape, not perfect though. Never contacted seller...too much trouble to deal with sending it back. otherwise cool gift."
4,Satisified,"Even though it not exactly like the one in the movie, it sure it close enough to be an enjoyable novelty. It's built very well, good quality item. It has a three way switch, so you can turn on only the bulb, or just the leg, or both. The only thing I don't like is that the entire leg doesn't light up, instead just the middle of the calf lights ups. It makes it look like a lower and upper bulb are burnt out."
5,Desk top Leg Lamp,"Very cute! You can light just the leg as a night lite, just the top for a desk lamp or both for the full effect! Perfect size for a desk or small table. I bought it for my husband as a fun Christmas gift, but I think we're going to use it all year long!"
2,Good but not exact.,The leg is good but not an exact replica. Stockings are not realistic. In the movie the leg went up to the buttocks. Not in the minature.
3,Lamp,A little pricey for the size. It was a christmas gift for my son and his favorite movie is A Cristmas Storey.
3,review,this book is outdated. i used the book for a short amount of time and resold it. will obtain updated version soon.
3,slow,"book arrived in perfect shape, but took about 2 weeks to get to me, which put me really behind in school."
5,Guaranteed Success,"As a 1st Grade teacher, I have a wide range of reading and handwriting abilities. Keeping them all motivated can be a challenge. I have yet to meet a child, however, who will not jump at the chance to draw. I have the Draw Write Now series and am anxiously awaiting Book 7. No matter what the child's level, they can experience instant success in this program. The step-by-step directions are clear and easily understood. I find that after the writing and drawing, the students are motivated to extend their lesson with other reading and writing experiences, as well as with a variety of art projects."
5,E-Book makes teaching fun!,"I have purchased each ""Draw Write Now"" book at least twice, because I always end up losing or misplacing them. They are also always spirited away by one of my students. With the e-book, I am able to load the desired pages from my Kindle app on my computer, and project them from my smartboard. This makes teaching the lesson so much easier; everyone can see the steps and examples, and I get to keep my book in a safe place. I'm going to get all of them!"
4,nice,"everything went just like it was suppose to go, product was what they said, no problems. good job thanks.only gave them four stars because nothing is perfect always room for improvement."
5,Dramatically increase the quality of your workouts,"This DVD has become a welcome addition to my training arsenal. In the past I would get on the stationary bike for about 7 minutes and maybe do some light warm up sets with some weights. Now, with the information on this DVD, my body is much more prepared for a high quality workout. Most importantly, my risk of injury is eliminated. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in dramatically improving their workouts."
1,NOT BPA-free,"The nipples collapsed while my daughter was feeding and we had to interrupt her feeding to allow air to go into the bottle. Also, Amazon advertised these as BPA-free and they are not!"
1,would be 0 stars if possible,Have NO idea how this is called freestyle.Mostly lame RnB.I don't get why it's called greatest freestyle hits.I mean WTF!!
4,Okie Noodling,"""I haven't seen anything as strange and compelling as Okie Noodling."" --Chris Gore, Film ThreatHey Chris Gore you sure must be leadin' a pretty sheltered life if this here is the strangest and most compelling thing you ever seen. But I'll agree it sure is pretty compelling and just a little strange. All these guys do is catch big ole catfish with their bare hands. It's a tradition and they call it ""noodling"". It looks like a lotta fun. I'm a documentary fan and love learning about people and culture. I'd recommend ""Okie Noodling"" to folks interested in seeing somethan they probably haven't, people that just enjoy a good documentary and those that like the outdoors, especially fishing."
1,Avoid Westinghouse TV's,"Do not buy this TV or any others from Westinghouse. My LTV-32w6 from Best Buy started intermittently flickering and eventually died after about 3.5 years, which was about $340 per year. I asked Westinghouse for help and they emailed me several suggestions, none of which worked. When I told them their suggestions didn't work, they never replied back. I tried to have it repaired, but the necessary spare parts are no longer made. When I searched the internet and found how many other people had similar problems with this TV and found that Westinghouse ranks with the worst on Consumer Reports brand reliability, I kicked myself for ever falling for the decent price. I have since purchased a Sony."
5,High Quality and Attractive Price,"This television is an outstanding value! The picture quality is outstanding in high-def broadcast as well as with an upconverter DVD player. Its simplicity and ease of set-up and use make it a joy to own and operate. The sound quality is very good, with great stereo separation and an almost surround-sound quality. BestBuy had it on sale for $699 and there is no comparison with anything else in the price range. This is definitely a ""best-bang-for-the-buck"" masterpiece!UPDATE: This television crapped out on me after only about 2 years. Ended up having to take it back to the store under the extended warranty and get a different brand set. Sony Bravia is much better!"
2,Great for a year -- now no picture,"I got an amazing deal on this TV and was quite happy with it at first. Unfortunately, a year later, the TV has a major problem... the picture comes on for a split second and then fades to black. I checked online and several other people have the exact same issue.It's a great set, but not worth buying for only one year of use."
2,Going bad after only 16 months,"I have had this TV for 16 months. Until now it was great. Great price, great picture, sound, everything. Now we are having problems with the display starting to pixelate and then blink and blank out, then come back on. This has just started happening and seems to be getting worse. Of course, we are 4 months out of warranty. I expected a TV from Westinghouse to last A LOT longer than this. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Has it's moments,"Daryl is a talented guitarist who has played on many spectacular records and has been a permanent touring member of Genesis for a long time. This is the first solo disc I've heard by him and it's decent, however, while some songs are good, others aren't as good, so for me this is mixed bag. ""Go"" has an abundance of guitar solos and Daryl's playing sounds similar to a combination of Johnson/Holdsworth, which is not bad by any means, I only wish he would find his own voice. Anyway, some people will love this disc and you should check it out if you like instrumental fusion with lots of guitar work, but in my opinion there are better choices in this genre."
3,Not that great for my 3-yr old truck-lover.,"I love Little Tikes - I saw this truck and thought it would be a great addition to our ""garage"". All the way home my son wanted it out of the box so he could play with it, and it had all the signs of being a hit. However, as soon as it was out of the box, he discovered that he couldn't put anything INTO the mixer barrel. The opening is too small for any of the little toys he wanted to stow in it and drive around and ""mix"". He abandoned it not a half hour after it was opened, and it's going back to the store. I'll be looking around for a cement mixer that he can actually put stuff into."
2,Two stars.,"I was not impressed with the book. Characters are rather represented by two-dimensional shadows. Although I support and even extend the idea of one of the readers. The Encyclopedia of Emigration, where people would describe their experiences, both sad and funny is overdue. My rating of this book is sadly based on the ruined high expectations because I am from Riga, Latvia too. I don't feel that the author has something to say in the future either. Hope that I will be proven wrong."
3,So-so,"I found this book disappointing. After reading a rapturous review in the ""Forward,"" I expected something more. Parts of the stories here and there were interesting or well-done, but overall, they weren't terribly compelling."
5,Little treasure of a book,"I devoured this book in one evening. As a Russian immigrant from Riga, I found it incredibly evocative, compelling, and nostalgic. In his writing, David Bezmozgis managed to recreate the bitter sweet feeling you are left with after visiting an old immigrant community that you grew up in, where your journey into the New World began. You lose part of yourself to adapt to the New World, to succeed, to fit in; David's stories reflect well the progress of one family becoming part of the Western World, and leaving the Old World behind. I really look forward to more books from this brilliant young author."
4,short story collection that reads like a novel,"david bezmozgis, in his debut collection, has drawn a vivid portrayal of the 'immigrant experience' by narrating what is seemingly autobiographical fiction. the stories set chronologically reveal the growing up of mark berman and how his family adapts to the experience of living in a new land.bezmozgis through small sharp vignettes has the ability to create powerful images and vivid characters. the stories themselves are by turns remarkable, touching and funny. but they always manage to be insightful and reveal his wonderful ability to provide insights into human nature through their seemingly commonplace actions. the title story in particular will have to go down as a minor materpiece.this is a collection that fans of jhumpa lahiri's interpreter of maladies might enjoy. however, on the whole bezmozgis leaves you wishing for a whole loaf while he merely provides afew slices."
4,Review by Madiha Naseem,"Natasha and other stories is a well written collection of different stories. Through out these stories the author David Bezmozgis writes his own imigrant experiences by applying them to a different character. These stories are totally different from other stories about imigrnat experiences. From time to time there is a progression of different factors such as social,friends, school, language and culture and the author connects all of them one by one. I think it is a great book to read. This book is not to be missed."
3,A nice pack of stories.,"One of the best parts of this book is that I got to feel the ""new-point-of-view"" excitement. Y'know the fun that comes from a person seeing your world but with their own cultural set of eyeglasses on? I can see where he became the toast of the town with this collection - I do think it started stronger than it ended though. But overall, I'll be picking up his next one..."
4,Great for church or the car!,"This book is great for when we need to have our children- ages one and three- entertain themselves quietly. It is perfect for church and its small size allows me to keep it in my purse or diaper bag for other times. There are a lot of parts for them to move or connect with each other. However, I do agree that the parts are not very durable and we are now on our second copy of the book- but it is well worth the money!"
4,Five for the Hell,"It's a good action film whjch mixed war and western.The plot is simple. In world war II, five American soldiersattack the headquater of Nazi to get the secret paper.But the action is fantastic. The film is mixed war & western& some kind of martial arts.Especially Nick Jordan's thumbling action seems a ChineseKung Fu star."
3,Another compact digi-disappointment...,"I will say right off the bat, that the waterproof feature is something that I hope all digital camera manufacturers will adopt, eventually. After two days of use, I dropped it in the bathtub, from my shirt pocket. No problems at all! BUT, I was not impressed with the pixel configuration. I've seen images from a 3.2 MegaPixel camera, up-res'd that offer a clearer image. WHen blown up to 200%, the image looks very fuzzy. It could also be the fault of poor optics, not sure. Also, very poor focusing ability in low-light conditions. Although, the Macro function, when it could find a contrast-point to focus on, produced a solid image. Hope you'll decide for yourself..."
3,"Nice features, but not great image quality.","This camera was really cool. Loved the size. Easily fit into my pocket. It can even zoom in video mode. Just about everything made me want to keep it, but the image quality. It just was not good enough for me."
4,WPi 6MP Pentax Camera,A great little camera. 6x gives it pretty good resolution for a small camera. The battery life is good and additional batteries are not expensive. The one thing lacking is an optical viewfinder. The LCD screen is very hard to use in bright light.
3,OMG,"I received these cutters in the mail today. I have to start lifting again in order to use them. They must be all of twenty pounds. It says ten, but I don't believe it. I am 66 years old and I will have a heck of a time cutting any bolts just because of the shear weight of this tool. The handles are solid iron. I have a pair of cutters...small pair... that have tubular steel handles. Not these. Not sure how they will work, but be aware of how heavy and uncomfortable they are to use. If you have to use them over your head, forget it!"
4,Good Home Use Bolt Cutters,"It says right there in the title that it's heavy duty, but until I got this thing in my hands I didn't realize that it really was. It's hefty, and looks menacing, like something the A-Team would strap to their van wall. It cuts pretty good. I only used it to cut a light weight swing set chain, and it/I did so with only a slight grunt. Well worth the price, and a good thing to have around as one of those ""I wish we had a bolt cutter...oh wait we do!"" items."
1,"A Lot of Effort, But Heavily Flawed","Like Melton's ""The Vampire Book,"" this edition contains lots of information that is outright incorrect or, worse, mixes good info with factual errors. Considering that Visible Ink is a division of Gale Research, this is inexcusable! One fact-checker could have corrected a lot of Melton's errors. Did ""Forever Knight"" last three or four seasons? Is Vampirella really the reincarnation of Cleopatra? All of these mistakes make the book essentially useless as a reliable source of reference!"
5,BEST GUIDE TO VAMP LITRATURE.,I am glad this book was made. The Vampire Litrature is the most interesting of all horror. I look forward to opening it up and reading about whats available to read on vampires.
2,I haven't received my product yet. It has been more than a month,I haven't received my product yet. I ordered more than a month ago and I'm still waiting. I contacted them and it seems the book was lost so they resent it but no sign. I am still waiting.
5,The best,This book is written in diary form. It is about a boy who gets caught in between two sides and has to live side by side with black slaves who are escaping for the North. I really liked this book because it's really explanatory and very adventurous.
4,8th grade review,"This book is written as if it were in the first person point of view of James Edmond Pease like a journal. Pease is a 16 year old boy fighting in the Civil War as a pvt. He goes through lots of different adventures, that are fictional, throughout this book while staying true to the actual Civil War. If you are in middle school learning about the Civil War this is a very good book for you!"
5,Definitely bleeding edge,"This book is a valuable and important reference for those of us trying to ride the bleeding edge of concepts, issues, and softwares related to modeling longitudinal group data."
4,Pretty good season!,"I was very excited to get the 7th season of Bones, my husband and I have grown to enjoy it very much.It had alot more personal / relational aspects in the season and a bit less on the solving cases, but was still all in all very good.We were pretty disappointed that it only had 13 episodes when the others average 20 or more."
3,A little disapointed,Starting to fall in to the same thing that sinks a lot of series. Up to this season I would give them 5 stars but now were in to baby world. Much to much time devoted to the kids and personal problems and not the crime solving. Hope they work it out because I loved it up until now. House did the same thing at the end of series.
3,Unfulfilling,Bones Seventh Season was a short one so it was not as filling as others. Some story lines closer to sci-fi than believable drama.
4,Bones 7th S,Babies Babies every where luckily all the gorey stuff is extra yukky this year otherwise we could have gone into a diabetic coma.the last ep was the best of the season and look forward to next year too.
2,Hard to Navigate,"This season set had no way to go to a specific program other than using the fast forward button and trying to find the beginning of a new show. I like to be able to re-watch specific shows, which is why I purchase the season sets. Seasons 1-6 all had the ability to select a specific program. I was surprised and VERY disappointed that this season did not. Although I enjoyed the programs, I will rarely watch this DVD set because of the inability to select the specific episodes. This will also be the last season set I purchase unless I know that this problem is corrected."
5,Bones is fabulous!,"This show is one of my absolute favorites lately. I am so happy I stumbled upon an episode as a rerun. Honestly, everyone should watch this show because I can't think of a single thing that I don't like about that show."
4,Brilliant Show,I love Bones and this is a great season in particular. The only issue I had with it was the price. It's rather expensive for a series with only 13 episodes!
3,Finder Sucks bring back my bones!,"Bones is awesome, and putting it on hold for a new show aka the finder sucks. Bring back my bones!"
2,The Suit on the Set,ANY MORE LIKE THIS AND I WILL NO LONGER BE WATCHING BONES. BOOTH IS GETTING DUMBAND DUMBER. BONES IS GETTING SO FAR AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL CHARACTER THAT SHE IS NO LONGER FUN TO WATCH. AT THIS RATE YOU WILL LOSE A LOT OF DIEHARD FANS. PLEASE GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMAT.
2,We have a Problem,"Hello David - I was actually logging on to contact you regarding Season 7 of Bones and as it happens, there was your email asking for my rating. Well Sir, Everything looked to be in order but upon viewing one disc of Bones was not Bones at all but a disc from Philadelphia. Both labels looked a lot alike. So, the question is, can I swap the Philadelphia disc for the missing Bones disc? The question is, did you sell the Philadelphia series to another buyer? This Season 7 was gift to a friend and she was a little disappointed as she is a super fan of Bones. If you sold Philadelphia you'll probably hear from them too unless they don't know yet. I hope we can resolve this issue as clearly you are an excellent seller. Ray Sutton - Email DocRS1951@comcast.net."
4,Short,"The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because the season was shorter than usual. Season seven had only 13 episodes, besides that I love the show."
4,a series for adults,I think it is a very good series. The entire grew is great. Loved every minute. Can't wait for the Eight series
5,Tv show,Was good and I am sure I will download additional episodes in the future! Very easy to download and okay price.
2,Extremely disappointed,"If you only care about having the 7th season episodes, then it's fine. But considering the season was cut in half and the extras were pathetic, Fox should have charged only half the normal price for a season."
5,Bones,One of my absolute favorite TV series. David Boreanaz is with out a shadow of a doubt one of my absolute favorite actors. He is smoking hot!sexy funny talented. And I collect all his Movies & TV series. And love them all.
3,Not the best season,"Of all the seasons of this show (and we've seen every one), we fans of Bones were least impressed with this one. Booth especially gets annoying and things don't add up."
1,Jumped the shark. Completely unbelievable.,"Some of the ""hacking"" things that were done can, in fact, be done.However, not the way that was stated, and the reactions of people who do know computers (e.g. Angela) are horribly wrong.Also, almost everyone is acting out of character.Angela can't believe Pelant was able to edit a video to change the timestamp. She didn't say that it was edited too cleanly, but ""how was it done?""The timestamp was inside of a black rectangle. That would be extremely easy for anyone with video editing software to change.I think I've given up on this show.Too lazy to continue this review."
3,Bones/Booth relationship,"I agree with one of the previous reviews. The intimacy is gone. By this time Booth should that when Bones makes a comment about him or someone she is not trying to be hurtful. Also Booth has been through child birth before. His over protection is very irritating to me. Temperance is a strong woman who can take care of herself. (this fact has always bothered me from the start) And being a college educated Booth cannot possibly be as ignorant as the writers have portrayed him. His grammar is awful. For example ""This here"" is my partner"". I think David should pay more attention to how they are portraying Booth. I really like the show but is this continues ""not so much"""
2,money hungry,The review is short and sweet. I have bought all the seasons but to pay the exact price for a regular 22 episode season is just greed. I hope people realize that if the producers and the cast due not feel a dent financial from this they will due it again and they might jack up the price for 22 episodes in the future' be smart people and wait until the price goes down or don't buy it!!!!
4,Bones 7th season,"I have not viewed this dvd yet but do intend to do so in the future, it appeared to be in great condition."
5,Great Blue Ray,Great service. Arrived in two days even though they said it would arrive in five to seven days. Blue Ray's looked brand new no scratches.
4,Great,"This product was an amazing price, and it came sooner then the expected date. The packaging was the right size and was good."
5,Fav show,Another great season! I really enjoyed How the characters have grown and changed in this season. I'm excited to find out what happens in following season. I wait to watch so I can see them in a row!
5,Great Show...,"I am watching season seven now and enjoying it. The babies (Angela's and Bone's) are sooo cute. Due to Emily Deschanel's pregnancy and baby's birth, this season is only 13 episodes long, but the episodes are all good so far."
4,Still great Bones but a little mushy,"Started watching Bones on Netflix from season 1 and loved it!!Im not sure how i feel about the Bones, Booth hook up yet but couldn't stop at season 6.All caught up now but kinda disappointed season 7 was only 13 episodes...Hopefully it gets back to being season 3,4,5, good!! But I'm addicted now!"
5,Bones video,Very well received by my daughter. I found the price of this excellent as compared to in the stores. I'm sure that a Bones marathon will be watched!
5,Love it,I can't stop watching this show! I want every single episode and all seasons! I love it! Everyone should watch this
4,Bones Season 7,Awesome series can't wait to watch season 8. All the characters have very good chemistry and the stories are always intriging.
4,"Delivery Good, Season Good","This season was a bit uneven, with some high moments and low moments, but in all the 13 episodes continue the story of Brennan and Booth forward. Obviously, the shortened season resulted in a few things feeling a little bit rushed, but that's the nature of it. That happened to season 3 as well.Some of the episodes were truly off the wall, but what do you expect? Normal murders don't get a forensic anthropologist, do they?And then there's the way the season ended, with Booth watching Brennan drive off with their daughter. Not a happy moment. Not at all!"
5,awesome,"awesome show, the instant video is kinda horrible and slow though, just buy the dvd and save yourself some buffering time"
4,Great but too short,"We love the series so, we knew these would, again be terrific. We were hoping for a few more stories in the season."
5,Good season,"I liked the 7th season a lot! There's a development of the characters (not all though), the interpersonal relationships take upper hand, but in an interesting way. The relationship between Booth and Bone steps up to the next level. I was not dissapointed by this season and I am looking forward to Season eight!"
2,Primarily on Major Matt Mason dolls,The title on the cover of the book might be a little deceiving; the full title is more accurate. This book is OK if all you are interested in is Matt Mason and Zeroids but very little in the way of other space toys is in this book. The organization of the material leaves something to be desired and the images are not always the best.
3,Outer Space ... Brought Down to Earth,"Billed as ""Space Toys of the '60s,"" it actually covers just three: Mattel's Major Matt Mason, Ideal's Zeroids, and Colorforms' Outer Space Men. As a guide to those lines, the book is certainly a useful resource with its extensive descriptions, part numbers, photos, and more. In all other respects, the book leaves a great deal to be desired: A host of blurry, indistinct JPEGs well below even the worst cell camera standards and repetitive, oftentimes confusing, copy that a strong editor could easily have reduced to about 1/3 its length (leaving room for a slew of other space toys of the '60s that I hoped might be included). Someone looking to take a trip down memory lane--certainly anyone looking for the kind of visual feast these sorts of books often offer--would likely be more satisfied by any number of broader retrospectives on [ray] guns, robots, etc. But the serious fan/collector is reasonably well-served."
5,Its Scorpio-tastic!,"You betcha, James's book is a must have for sci-fi and space toy collectors and baby boomers alike. Crammed with piccies of Captain Laser, Callisto, Scorpio, Or, Zeroids and those fantastic Outerspacemen ( Orbitron is my personal fave), this shares centre stage on my bookshelf with Bill Bruegman's Toys of the Sixties. Gotta have it.Well done Mr.Gillam."
5,"This book is a MUST for the Matt Mason, Zeroid collector !","WOW ... Sums up this book. With pages upon pages of fantastic full color pictures, lots in actual toy size this is a must have, two thumbs up, stop everything your doing right NOW and run to you computer and get it. Clear descriptions noting variations in boxes and just about everything else you won't be disappointed. The story of Mattel, Ideal and Colorforms companies makes for easy reading and is interesting, even for the ""non"" collector. I loved all the NASA and real life tie-in information too. Three words sum this book up ""GET ONE NOW"" WOW"
5,"VERY detailed book about matt, zeroids and colorforms. A+++","if u want to know about matt, zeroids or colorform aliens, this is THE book to get. everything you could ever want to know is in here w/ pics to boot. best book i've seen covering the subjects mentioned. you won't be disappointed. =)"
3,One thumb up / One thumb down,"I'd recommend this book for serious collectors rather than nostalgia buffs. Be warned that it's about Major Matt Mason, Zeriods & Colorform Space Men ... PERIOD. Since it was called ""Space toys of the 60's"" I thought it might contain some of the other hundreds of 60's space toys as well. Not.== PROS ==> Lists far more MMM & Z sets than I knew existed, if it's not complete it comes close.> Color pictures of each toy> Descriptions of each toy's attributes & actions== CONS ==> Poor quality pictures> Poor quality paper> Poor quality bindingBuy it if you're looking for a reference. If you're looking for an artsy coffee table book, you might look elsewhere."
3,Just so so,"The book promises to improve your writing, which of course they all do. There were a few tidbits of useful information here, and a professional writer may benefit from the early chapters of the book. I found muich of the rest of the book to be tedious and boring.I think the book should be much shorter than it is. There's too much repetition after the first third. This is not uncommobn. If an auithor doesn't have enough material to complete a book then he should simply wait until he does, THEN write his book.Save The Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need"
2,There are much better books out there on the same topic,"If you are looking for a book that can help you create greater emotional impact in your writing, this is NOT the book you're looking for. I bought this book hoping for that and was disappointed with the high-school level content of this book. If you are looking for specific techniques for creating and amplifying emotion in your fiction, you can not do better than attending David Freeman's ground-breaking course ""Beyond Structure."" If you can't do that, then buy David's book, ""Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering (New Riders Games)."" Yes, it's about creating emotional impact in video games and not the type of fiction most writers aspire to, but don't let that fool you - ""Creating Emotion in Games"" is packed full of writing advice, techniques, and frameworks that are invaluable for any writer working in any medium."
3,a little disappointed,"this book promised to offer ideas not available in others. so far it mimics others, offering only occasional new tidbits. some sections are re-used verbatum, wholly repeated under a different sub-heading. some premises are hinted at, but copped out on, excused by referring to another book that 'already beat us to it' and recommending the book. i bought THIS book for the info. didn't want to buy another. not a solid offering. probably not one i'd recommend or keep on my shelf. :("
4,Amityvixen's review,"If you're into writing whether script or novelas, this book will give you tips on how your main characters jump out and how each scene make the characters evolve throughout. Good reference book, a must have."
5,Best screenwriting book ever.,"I've read this book at least 3 times. I've read over 10 books on screenwriting and this, by far, is the best book on screenwriting. This book is for anyone who feels that they are stuck in their screenwriting. What do I mean by stuck? If you feel that you have put your all into writing screenplay, but you're not winning competitions or selling on the market, this book will get you over the hump. My writing is much better because of Karl's book. I have never met the guy, but I hope I get the chance. This book is worth more than the price."
5,great instructional resource (schoolchildren),"details from website:This step-by-step approach to learning percussion technique and rhythmic patterns in the elementary and middle school general music class is practical, easy to teach and incredibly motivational.After extensive field-testing in the U.S. and Canada, World Music Drumming has passed all the tests! Aimed primarily at grades 6-8 with extensions into the lower elementary grades and the high school, you and your students will learn drumming techniques, sings lots of great songs with accompaniment and movement, connect African and Latin American cultural traditions to the music performed, and discover how music can be the perfect vehicle for teaching team building, respect, focusing, listening, problem solving, and other important life skills."
2,Fun Foods for Fussy Kids,"While the ideas are clever and the children may have fun making them, I doubt many kids will be enticed to eat. Call me crazy, but even though the red lettuce may look like a bunny ( see book cover), it still tastes like lettuce. Why would I spend 30 minutes to an hour making a cutsie food item using radishes, salmon, and lime slices. I wouldn't even eat that. It looks cute but, when it is all done you are going to have a plate of picked at scraps."
5,Great,14 songs on this DVD!1. Corazon Partio2. Ella Y El3. Amor Prohibido4. Entra En Mi Vida5. Volver Volver6. Jamas7. De Mi Enamorate8. Amor Eterno9. Burbujas De Amor10. Por Cobardia11. Palabra De Honor12. Abrazame Muy Fuerte13. Aun Le Amo14. Para Decir Adios
3,Narrow and outdated,"I expected this book to give a broader view of bdsm than it does: almost all of the contributors are gay men. It's also somewhat outdated, as the newest entries are from the 1990s. I think its best material is in the section ""Six Decades of Shadow Dancing,"" which gives an interesting historical perspective on bdsm (once again, a predominately gay male perspective). The last portion of the book focuses on spiritual aspects of bdsm and includes articles by a former monk and a self-identified shaman. As someone with no background in bdsm, I felt Leatherfolk had some interesting bits, but large chunks of it was too radical for my tastes (I wasn't convinced that all humans should experience the ""cosmic erotic ecstasy"" of fisting). Something of a disjointed, mixed bag."
5,This book is worth the read!,"I've had access to this book for sometime, and just last week received the hard copy in the mail. I'm very pleased with the look, and feel of the book. But, before even seeing that, just reading the words to the story, made me feel as though I were part of it, and captured my attention from the start. If you're a person who is interested in the dark side, vampires and folklore, this book is definately one you should read. I'm glad I did!"
3,Convenient for basic chord diagrams,"This is a convenient quick reference for basic chords. The chords are presented according to the key. So, once you find the chord you're looking for you will also find other chords used in the same key. There is also a nice reference on movable chords (positions).There is a logic in the way the chords are listed, but if you don't have a good understanding of scales you won't realize the logic. For instance the keys are presented in the order of C, Am, G, Em, D, etc. The table of contents makes finding the key your looking for easy.For a quick reference that will fit your guitar case it serves it purpose well."
3,You get what you pay for.,"These headphones can't seem to handle any bass or loud volume. You hear a rattling sound if you turn your stereo above 6. Also, you hear the people talking around you, and they can hear what your listening to."
2,Just not for me,"This just didn't fit right. It curled under. The wider ""comfort"" area of the straps fit too low in front. The closure to nurse wouldn't work with one hand. It was fine during pregnancy. I bought the Bravado instead and LOVE it, so bought 2 more."
4,Not a review just a complaint to distributors,"Once again a Blu-ray title is only available in the US and a world wide audience can't buy it due to region locking. I'm region B and they have chosen to lock their product to Region A. I really wanted Ordinary Decent Criminal and would have bought it right here and now if I could. The movie studios wonder why there is piracy, well perhaps because paying customers can't buy the product even if they want to. Sorry I just had to rant after about the 10th Blu-ray release I've wanted to buy today and couldn't (and aren't available anywhere else but the US currently).Sadly I don't think distributors or studios ever pay attention to their customers, so they will never get the message.As I had to put a rating I put 4 stars for what I remember as being a very good film ""Ordinary Decent Criminal"", of course my memory would be helped if I could actually buy the damn product."
5,Garmin E Trex GPS,"My husband already had one of these, but says this one is much better and actually does alot more than his older one...FIVE stars in his book!"
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this unit to take with me deer hunting. It did not track the satellites initially so I returned it. I had the same difficulty with the second unit. The seller couldn't explain why both malfunctioned so I just got my money back. My advice is to take 2 AA batteries with you, open the package, install them and test the unit before you leave the parking lot. I guess there are no satellites over Gray, Georgia."
1,Had To Return It,"Purchased it after doing some research. I wanted it for a MTB vacation in an area that I was not familiar with. After a few feeble attempts (with my wife making much fun), I strapped it to the bike and was determined to get it dialed in. Much to my surprise, it died when I needed it most. It wasn't the batteries. I returned it and got my money back! If you buy it - handle with care, take extra batteries, a compass and a good map !"
1,Kept losing signal,"Great concept and user interface. Unfortunately it would drop the signal so often in the Rockies it was useless for tracking your progress, and only reliable for point locations."
4,good,This is a great tracker. It's great with local and it can convert to universal time. I love that it's waterproof. The compass is not my favorite. I am glad I bought it and it is popular with fellow science teachers and hikers.
4,Great GPS but wrong Product Description,This is a great basic GPS but it is not color as indicated in the Product Description. The one pictured is eTrex Venture CX.
4,"Capable, Affordable - A Great Value","I really have no major complaints about my Garmin eTrex (lovingly called ""the yellow eTrex""). The interface is simple, and the unit is small and light.Some may wish they had gone a step up to a model with the thumb-stick for easier interface navigation. I was one such person, and I have to admit that the thumb stick is much easier to use than the up/down buttons that you're limited to with the yellow eTrex.Buyer beware when it comes to USED yellow eTrex models. Many versions of it were sold that were not WAAS enabled. You can ask a seller if the system menu has an option to disable/enable WAAS. If not, you're looking at a slightly less accurate model (but if the price is right for you, it shouldn't matter too much)."
3,Could Be Better,"I purchased the Garmin Etrex simply for the purpose of deer hunting. The advertisement stated that the unit was great in heavy tree cover. Well I disagree. While in light tree cover, I continued to get a display that indicated 'weak signal'. If you wear glasses and rely on your bio's to read by, then be sure you have your glasses with you (you'll definitely need them). I couldn't make out anything without them. The background is dark, and hard to read in sunlight. If you're in clear view of the sky, the unit works great. I would have returned the unit because it was hard to see mostly, and didn't live up to my expectations, (getting to and from my tree stand) but I had already ordered the video of how to operate the unit, which isn't that great either, and the case. Maybe after I have it for a while it'll get better, or when the leaves drop from the trees."
5,Garmin has good reception,"I own 3 GPS receivers and I will say Garmin did an excellent job. The receiver is much more sensitive to satellite signals than my other GPSs. Just don't expect too much from this small unit with tiny screen and very slow CPU for screen refresh. It will drive you nuts to use it for street navigation. It is suitable for back trailing in the mountains. For street navigate, I strongly suggest that you hook this unit up with a laptop but make sure that GPS is set to NMEA and the software GPS setting is also correct. Conclusion, don't street navigate with this unit alone and don't buy a no brand GPS under $90 because you will not be happy with the reception.Eddy"
5,Good value,"Contrary to what one person said, it is easy to enter a waypoint, you simply hold the 'enter' button down for about 2 seconds and your waypoint is entered. You of course have the option of giving it a name at that point or just assigning it a number. NO big deal, its easy.The main thing I don't like is the battery life. The manual says 22 hrs. in battery saver mode without using the backlight, this may be true but I run it in normal mode and I get maybe 10 hours from four fresh batts.But this is a great item. It looks cool too, I know that's not important to many people but I bring it to social functions and everyone is like 'hey, what's that cool thing' or something like that. It's a great deal, rugged, waterproof to 3 meters. Yes I've had mine under water before and it is still working."
2,Not very good at all.Easy to use when it worked.,Wont work under tree canopy. Poor battery life! Fairly easy you use as long there are not anything above the GPS
4,Great,This is a great little GPS for a new learner. It was easy for me to figure out how to use it and I've never used one before.
2,Great...when it can reach the satellites,This little thing is great...the only problem is that it can hardly ever reach the satellites even when not under trees. It takes so long to acquire them that it's not even worth taking it with you. And then i put it back in the glove box. What is the point of a hiking helper that can't figure out where you are.
2,Little loser,"This unit is a great example of being penny wise and pound foolish. Sorry I spent the [money]. It takes forever for it to acquire satellite signals, and then when it does, it loses the signal if you don't hold it horizontally; drop it around your neck and it loses the signal. Basically, a waste of money."
3,The basic yellow etrex,"This basic yellow one is the cheapest one. It is alright but I dont know if you can download maps to it or not, they might be pretty expensive to get the CD's. Also the compass on it doesn't seem to be very accurate as many times it will not point in the right direction until you turn several times to make sure most of the time it is in the right direction. All it really gives you is a marking of where you've been, it has good info like elevation and speed, but its not for the serious GPS user."
5,great little gps for the money,I bought this gps to use for geo-caching. I have been out numerous times and have not been disappointed with the performance of the etrex. It is easy to use and very accurate for finding caches. I recommend this unit for any beginning geo-cachers. You will not be let down!!
3,"OK, but doesn't work under trees","My wife gave me an eTrex for my birthday, because we like to hike in the woods. When we're in a clearing, it works well, but when we're under any sort of leaf cover it doesn't acquire satellites very well at all. This also means that your tracks come out mutilated -- there are holes in them wherever the trees are.This happens while I hold the unit horizontally, vertically, or in any other position. I tried a lot of positions, and it still doesn't see the satellites when it's under a tree.If you can live with this limitation, the eTrex is fine. Otherwise, I'd recommend going up to a unit with a helical antenna."
3,Wish there was more memory,"I used this product driving across the USA and Canada, total of 15000 miles. Very accurate, reliable. Saved a lot of my time and gas. Only one thing, I wish there was more memory. Once the memory runes out, the older path of where you have been starts to get erased. I personally lost the record of where I drove in the morning by late afternoon,( if I drive containuously all day) It has a separate way point input option though, and it came out very handy. It does not work well in the concrete jungle (big cities) where you probably dont need GPS. There's too much other radio interference and tall buildings blocks the satelite signals in big cities, but instead there are many land marks and rode signs that confuses you and entertains you and afterall there are helpful to let you know ehre you are. over all, very nice product for low budget traveler and hiking purposes. love the size and burability."
5,Don't Leave Home Without It,"I bought this item just to see the buzz about GPS. I also bought an electronic auto compass the same time. By far, this little eTrex proved more accurate and useful. I don't bother to use the auto compass anymore.Although this is the basic eTrex model, it has many features I'm still learning about even owning it over a year. I use it to mark places and routes of favorite places. I also use it to enter coordinates of new places I'm driving ... the accuracy is amazing and I rarely get lost anymore. It measures speed, distance, time, elevation, sunrise, sunset, and much more. Very simple to use and many possible uses.I like this so much that I'm upgrading to the eTrex Legend."
3,Good GPS with some small flaws,"I had an etrex for a year. It was durable, got it at a great price, and was generally happy with it. The only real problems were that the battery case screw jammed sometimes and the coordinate numbers were too small to read easily. It would have been easy for the designers to make them bigger - this is just a flaw. Otherwise it was fine and well in line with other sub $100 units"
3,Power button not work,"I bought one last month, it works well, in every perspect except the power button. funny, isn't it? I got some problem with it which is, I had to push the POWER ON button several times then I could turn it on at the time I received it, now things is even worse, I have to push tens of times then I maybe turn it on by chance. But the worest thing is I bring it back to China and no one care about it anymore, both amazon and garmin. The distrubutor in China said it won't worth repairing, or with the fee I should be charged I could have a brand new one. Besides the repairing issues, I consider this as a design flaw of this product."
4,waterproof GPS,I bought this item for my 13 yr old son and he has been using it for geo-caching. It is a great unit for the price and a great way to enter the sport of geo-caching. He actually decided to do this instead of saving his money for an X-Box 360...it's nice to see him outside instead of in front of the TV.
5,Garmin eTrex GPS Review,"I love this product and would highly recommend it. The eTrex is the most affordable Garmin GPS, but still provides everything I need (it just doens't have the maps that the more expensive ones have - but usually there are no maps when you are hiking anyhow).I have used the eTrex in Scotland when hill walking. It has picked up satellites 95+% of the time and has been an invaluable tool for helping me find my way back when I get off track. I would highly recommend. Besides being useful as a bread crumb trail and for marking waypoints, it is also fun to see the summary statistics for each walk -- total miles, avg. speed, elevation, etc. etc.I also used the eTrex in Southern, Illinois, where there is thick tree cover. I picked up satellites about 75% of the time. This was still good enough to get my group back to our car when we got off the beaten path.Ed"
3,Too much,"It's a great unit for someone who would like play around with GPS. More advanced users will be dissapointed with it's lack of features.The eTrex has the ability to make your own maps right on the screen and that's about all it's good for. Each landmark you place on the map can only have 6 characters and must be unique. If you were to purchase the optional data cable you could make these landmarks on the pc and transfer them over. This makes things easier because you don't have to actually travel to each landmark to create it on your map.It has a tracback feature (so you can retrace your steps) but if you were to go on a trip for more then a few hours the memory quickly becomes full.If you want a gps to play with for the weekend, this unit might interest you. If you were to use it any longer, you quickly realise how limited it is.Do yourself a favor and get the model or two up with downloadable maps and more memory."
1,Don't rely on this product for hiking!,"This is my opinion of the Etrex GPS. I recently went backpacking in the Big South Fork national recreation area. I set a way point at my car and headed out. I received the weak signal prompt 90% of my hike. I'm glad the trails there are marked well and I didn't have to rely on this unit to get me back to my car. If your travels include hiking through wooded areas (even after the leaves have fallen off), don't use this device as your only source of navigation or you may find yourself lost!"
1,Very disappointed with Garmin eTrex GPS,"Hands off from this piece of junk! I had it less than a day when it, accidentally, fell from the kitchen countertop to the floor. Even though there was no visible damage body, the device went completely dead. It is unacceptable that a device for handheld field operation is that sensitive to handling, especially when it is made to look robust."
3,a good price ONLY NO MORE,"a great price it is an ok GPS but i need more Designed specifically for hiking, biking, and camping any way a Gift options is a WoWi think some time that i m 007 when Garmin eTrex GPS receiver continuously tracks and uses up to 12 satellitesbut now im 004"
4,Great gift,I gave these to my daughter as a gift and she loves them. They are very warm and feel like you are wearing slippers. The BEARPAW boots are true to size.
4,lining problem,"I've had these for about 6 weeks. Love how comfortable and warm they are, other than the insole detaching they seem to be well made and very good quality... I rate these a 4 because of the insole problem"
3,Make sure you order a bigger size!,"These boots feel and look great, but you need to order a size bigger than normal because I am a size 10 and I ordered a size 10 and my feet feel a little smushed. Otherwise, great shoes!"
1,Sent wrong boots,I had to return the boots twice..They sent a cheaper boot called EVA to me twice now..I really want the dreams but afraid to place another order with this.
4,Nice Ugg Alternative,"I've tried on Ugg boots before, but could never justify the price. I didn't realize there was a less expensive alternative out there until I started looking for boots for costuming purposes. My requires were a) inexpensive, b) comfortable, and c) something I could wear in and out of costume. I happened upon Bearpaw and was in love.Some reviewers have said that these run small and their toes hit the front of the boot. I can feel the seam with my toes, but I find that's more of an effect of the plush lining than the size. If I push my foot back where it normally sits, then the size is perfect.I dropped one star simply because I placed an order for the Dream model, but instead I got the Eva model. When I went back to Amazon, I noticed that when I add the item to the cart, it said it was the Eva model. I would have preferred the more structured sole of the Dream, but the Eva works fine."
5,You feel like you actually have little soft bear paws!,I love these boots! They are super comfy and warm! The sizes are very accurate as well.
1,Don't buy Bear Paws especially from LuggageBiz,I purchased these boots for my daughter. She loved them until after a month she walked down the sidewalk over a grate and the sole cracked totally across the bottom of the boot and was totally opened to the inner sole. Now water seeps in etc. This happened on Feb 5th I have contacted LuggageBiz who we purchased the boots from and have sent 3 notices asking for a refund or a pair of boots. They have never responded to my inquiries and Amazon has not helped in any way at all. I believe the boots to be defective but no one will help with this problem at all
1,Disappointed!,Poorly designed shoe. The BEARPAW boots cause my feet to slide forward making my toes jam up against the front of the shoes. I wore them for only 10 minutes and couldn't stand it because my toes were getting sore. I couldn't figure out why this was happening since there was plenty of space from where my toes end to the front of the shoe.I then compared the BEARPAW boots to my old UGG boots and noticed that the toe portion of the UGG boot tilts slightly upward and therefore does not cause my foot to slide forward.I'd like to return the BEARPAW boots but I'll lose the $16.00 in shipping costs ($8.20 to ship each direction) and I'll lose the 8% restocking fee! I'll probably return them anyway because the boots are a complete waste to keep.
2,BORING,The book was too simple. After a while I didn't care who killed the Mixons. This was my first Mama book and will probably be my last. I'm glad that I borrowed this book from the library because I could take it back!
4,Halloween,"I was all excited about getting this costume. When receiving it, it looked like a dog chewed on it for awhile. See those pointed things on the head portion, you have to keep pushing the foam in or it will spew all over the place. They are not sealed in anyway and don't stay in place very well. Also there is a bright red seam (thread) that connects the checkered to the black portion of the costume, there is one right in the front that makes it look ridiculous and cheap. I am still glad I got it and fits perfectly. But it isn't worth buying over 40 bucks."
1,Doesn't work -- brushes come off,"On the second use of this product, the brushes came out and are stuck in my car CD player. Now I have to take it in and either have it repaired or replaced because nothing plays on it. Don't buy this unless it's a last ditch effort because you're going to buy a new player anyway."
1,Brush came off in my player!,"Seems like a decent enough product, but on the very first use, one of the brushes fell off of the bottom of the lens cleaner while inside my car CD player, so now I've got a lens cleaner with one brush instead of two, and a fuzzy little brush part somewhere in the innards of my CD player. So far it hasn't done any harm, but the quality control appears to be lax."
4,"Works great, except for not having a handle.","I looked at the models that were offered by both Lyman and LEE, although they both had a handle they were made out of aluminium. I was looking for one that was made out of iron, as it would hold the heat better between pours. The only thing that this mold is lacking is a handle, get on it RCBS! If this mold had a handle, it would be perfect.The mold works well and is a well cast piece without a lot of marks and a nice smooth surface, and to top it all off, it is actually amde in the U.S.A.!"
4,Cast Iron. A good product.,"I cast pewter alloys, and recover the scrap, remelt it, and pour it into ready-to-use ingots in this mold.It is one of those products made for a simple use that simply cannot fail to work, and RCBS has been making good quality products for a long time.Unlike the photo, the mold I got has the RCBS logo in reverse relief, so your ingots will have that logo engraved in them. I'm neutral on the issue, since I am casting them for my own remelt use, but if a customer were to buy raw materials from me, it would give me pause.The mold has a generous draft, and upon cooling, the ingots readily fall out. It'll last a forever with low-melting alloys, the price is attractive, and it's all good."
4,The First Side Is Great,"One of Slayer's heaviest and fastest albums, except for the last track, all the songs are punk covers, combining all the energy of punk with the most savage ferocity that Slayer can muster up. The songs on the first side are especially good, with covers from Suicidal Tendencies, Minor Threat and others. This is one of the most brutal discs that I have ever heard; it really is Undisputed Attitude!"
4,Slayer should write their own punk...but still good,"This is a about as good of a cover album that you can buy. I would have loved them to cover a dead kennedys song like they promised but they must have forgot due to intoxication. Anyhow, some of these songs really rock. Superficial Love, Violent Pacification, and the Iggy Pop tune Im Gonna be Your God are highlights for me.There are few stinkers though. Mr. Freeze is a ridiculous song and the new one they wrote Gemini puts me to sleep. If its a punk album, why not make the new song a punk song? Oh well."
3,Good,Its good but its too short most of the songs on it are less than two minutes. Apart from that it is a fairly good album. Its fast (probably their fastest album) and it has a new song on it called Gemini which is cool even though it seems out of place on this album. But it would fit perfectly on South of Heaven. All in all its a pretty good cd.
5,Let Punk-Rock and Thrash Metal stand prod and united.,"I have always liked Punk-Rock, and I LOVE Thrash/Speed metal. What Slayer have done here is put them together and it RULES!!Every song on here is a winner. Old and long time fans of Slayer will not be let down here. Even if they hate usually hate Punk-Rock, and Old, long time fans of Punk-Rock who usually hate Thrash should also buy this. Amazing guitarists John Henneman and Kerry King give there very best here."
4,How the real punk should be.,"This cd may be a pile of punk covers, but they are well performed by the metal headbanger band. At first it seems a bit boring, and with not an usual Slayer sound, but as the music goes by it turns out to be a great album. These guys really know hoew to make punk sound good, no matter if they are a speed metal group. Some of the songs were really good before, but now they are way better. This album is a ""must buy"", believe me, it's good and it has great songs."
5,Blazin Tracks,"I had heard about this Melle Mel and Rondo album for awhile. Bought it last week and Loved it. The tracks ""You Know"" and ""It's All Good"" are my favorites. It is a great combination of East coast and West coast sounds. They are slammin together."
2,Don't Bother,"While this is a very nice collection, if you already have ""Keeping The Legend Alive"", ""Bareback At Big Sky"", and ""The Wildwood Sessions"", then you already own everything that's on this cd. I'm glad I only spent $3.50 on it. But if you don't own the 3 previously mentioned cds, then this is a very nice disc, very representative of what Poco sounds like today if you're fortunate enough to see them live."
1,Not Happy,"The Interface did not work, both sets of imputs were dead and the front left volumn control was broken, I sent it back and still have not received a credit? HELP"
1,Dynamics????,A monumental waste of money. You will get far more out of books by Steve Armstrong than from this misuse of hydrocarbon based product. Highly disappointing.
4,Bandera' bride,He' hidden his passion behind another man's name. For John Bandera knew that a genteel mississippi flower could never share her life with a half-breed Comanche rancher....this was a good book to read
1,Misleading,This is a group of very small car frames. that's right; not actual cars. Very different from how they are pictured on line.
4,Basic But Useful,"These cars will not lend ""authenticity"" to your layout; however, I found them very useful when determining the necessary width of roads and parking spaces. For the price, they are very worthwhile."
4,Good enough,"Good for background scenes in particular. They give you a lot for the money, and of course can be given weathering or other treatment to improve the looks."
2,Very poor Quality for the money,"Well I first thought these were for N Scale, that was my own fault. But I do plan on having a HO set at some point, but these cars are Dollar store quality. All they are is frames of cars. They look way better in the picture as opposed to having them in person. I would highly recommend paying more for something higher quality for your layout. I'm not anti Bachmann but in my opinion I have yet to find any of their products to be of high quality. If you want as much realism as possible on your layout I would suggest paying more from a company like walthers etc."
5,Cindy,"This video is great. Cindy is a great drummer and i learned a lot from this video. The sound that comes out when she plays is forceful, but at the same time it's passionate."
4,This is the tape to use with the UU RE Jesus and His Kingdom of Equals,"This is the movie that compliments the Unitarian Universalist RE class (around 3rd and 4th grade) 'Jesus and His Kingdom of Equals'.I couldn't find it in DVD so it looks like VHS is the only way to get one.The tape shows what the landscape and location of the area looked like where Jesus would have spent time. It talks about the people and traditions of the time.It plays like you think a Readers Digest type documentary would play (slow, educational, mildly interesting). The really interesting thing is that our 3rd and 4th grade UUs just love this movie. They ask for it to be played."
4,Excellent performance of Mahler's 8th Symphony,"This is an excellent performance of Mahler's 8th Symphony.The soloists sound wonderful: no straining to reach notes, no notes out of tune or edginess in the female voices. The orchestra plays well. Leonard Bernstein never disappoints when he conducts Mahler's Symphonies.The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars because the DTS 5.1 surround sound track is very trebley, that is, there isn't enough bass to make the sound feel full and grounded enough. This can be remedied if your AV receiver has bass or equalizer adjustments. If not, listen to the performance in the PCM stereo track instead, which sounds/feels fuller and more grounded."
2,"performance-yes; sound-no,no,no!","I revere Bernstein and all that but the main reason I am buying Mahler symphonies on DVD is to benefit from their phenomenal sound quality. I was shocked to find with Bernsteins version that I got in effect, a CD with pictures. Pinched and hard with not much depth. I was so taken aback that I put on Abbados 2nd to see if my equipment may have gone out of wack but it was everything Bernsteins was not. Deep, Wide, and Luscious!!! So if you are just after Bernsteins performance--great. If you are after great sound--no,no,no!! Which is not to say Abbados performance doesn't match Bernsteins on all counts--it definitely does."
3,SoSO,No instructions given or explainations included. Just put in a box and shipped. Don't understand this item at all. Cheaply put together.
2,Pretty Chincy,"If I would have known how ""cheap"" it is.... I would not have paid that money for it... I MAYBE would have paid $5 TOPS.... but it is probably worth about $1-$2... seems like it is something you would find in a dollar store--- feels like it is made out of a tin can and can pretty much be bent easily. I didn't open it and put it together because it's a gift, but I am sure it will be just as cheap looking put together :/"
3,ok,when useing this it seens to go to the maybe choice 90 percent of the time. i think the magnets are not the same strength.
1,Makes Bad Decisions,I lost a lot of money with this quirky little chaotic doohickey. I'm going back to the dependable Ouiji Board -- it never fails. Even the 8-ball makes better decisions IMHO.
3,A toy,"This was more lightweight than I expected. A bendable toy. However, the ball really does stop on one of the answers so it is fun. My Dad really liked it, but I was just a little embarrassed giving it to him because I thought it would be nicer."
3,It's ok,"Its a cool toy, but don't expect much. It gets really boring after a while. Also, unless you move the metal arm that holds the bar it only allows it to reach certain outcomes. I don't recall how much I paid for it but if I bought it again I wouldn't pay more than 5 dollars for it. Its also a very cheaply made toy, very fragile and flimsy."
4,Cool office toy,Although is made with cheap materials...this decision maker is a very cool looking desk toy....A must have!!!...Cant beat the price. Fast delivery. Very pleased
4,cute,"sits on my desk and every once in awhile i use it, its cute, and a conversation starter, i like it, and the price is works"
4,fun gift,"This was used as white elephant gift and the recipient really liked it. He uses it in his office at work and sometimes jokes with employees that it will provide the answer to their questions.marked it 4 stars because it came just in a plain white box with just the gift. I think it did have a label on the box, but the recipient was unsure what it was. Luckily it's a simple item though, so it was pretty easy for him to figure it out."
4,entertaining,"This item at first I didn't like, but after playing around with it and realizing you swing it when you ask the question then let it do it's thing....it ended up being a lot of fun, and most people wanted to ask it a question...simple fun, an updated 8 ball!"
3,decison maker,"I should've had or used one of these before purchasing the above. It's is what it is, flimsy plastic/metallish material. More of a county fair ""grand prize"" prize?"
3,Cute idea,"The toy is cute and entertaining, but very flimsy and cheap looking. Looks like you could have made one yourself."
5,Excelent,"Although I'm not a specialist in this field and it is not written in my mother tonguethe book took all my interest.It is absolutly faczinating.Nevertheless more technical information and less ""old time""stories would be appreciated by me.I want to have more of these kind of books.Sorry for my poor English.CongratsDr. G. Staengl"
4,Wonderful,"It took me several chapters to get into this book, but once the authors began extrapolating on the reasons for various features of the Nariokotome boy, I was hooked. It contains some fascinating facts and speculations on our species' origins which stick with you to contemplate long after you finish the book."
2,Comfortable but small,I don't consider myself a big person. I like to think that I am pretty average but either my head is huge or this face mask is small. The eye holes would almost steach to my ears better than my eyes. I had to stitch the outside of the eyes together to keep from looking like (my 5 year old sons words not mine) I had been bitten by a radioactive spider. The material is really nice but the eye holes could have been done better.
4,nice and warm but the bridge of the nose broke within days,i was using the mask and the small threads holding it together at the eyes tore and now it's a cyclops mask. not really a big deal it can be easily fixed.
2,"SMALL, SMALL,SMALL...","Believe me, I don't have a big head, this mask is small for me and the thread near the nose just was out when I received it...Only reason I gave this item 2 stars is because of it's quality. It has a pretty good quality for the price."
4,"Warm And Comfortable, But Needs Better Stitching","This Ski Mask is very warm and comfortable. I got the black version, and it looks very nice. This stitching around the eyes is a bit of a problem though. The point where the eye holes come together over your nose, is very thin and fragile. The stitching on mine broke, and now I have a two hole ski mask. I was careful with it because I noticed right away that it looked fragile, but it broke anyway. However, having a two hole mask instead of a three hole does not bother me that much, but it may be a factor for you. Now, another reviewer mentioned that it was small. I do not have this problem. I am a bit larger than the average person, and this thing fits just fine. I assume it will fit fine on you too. If you need a ski mask, I cant think of a better one to get, and it is selling for a very reasonable price."
4,Keeps my face warm and my mouth open,"I was relieved to find this mask on Amazon. It was so hard to find a mask that offered a mouth hole. I am a mouth breather when I'm outside; I need my mouth free to take in the cold air.Although I felt silly looking like a cheap wrestler, the mask kept my face warm. My only complaint would be the mouth hole and eye holes like to travel around and I have to keep twisting them back around. But that might be the fault of my big head."
1,wish we didn't buy,"the piece that kept the eye holes seperate was poorly made and falling apart as soon as we opened the package. by the time my son put it on, it was ready to tear and tore soon after. i am also disappointed because there was no receipt. i was trying to save myself a shopping trip. should have just went to the army navy store."
1,Garbage,"Poor fit, poor quality, non-existent insulation. This item was to be used for the purpose of skiing. I can only imagine it now used to scare the neighbors throwing out the trash with this item included in it."
3,Wrong material for me,"My first ski mask. I should have gone without the open mouth part. When it's cold enough to use the mask, it's cold enough to want my mouth covered as well. Also, I don't care for the material, it's a little scratchy on my face though not a deal breaker. The next one will be a smoother material with no mouth opening. Overall, I would say it's fine for most and I use it fairly often but it's not the perfect mask by any stretch."
2,Cheap,"Cheap material and one eye hole is much bigger than the other, I feel like the material could rip and snag."
3,The book's okay.....,"This book is just ""okay"". I have been looking for a good book on breeding holland lops, and this covers it minimally. I would advise anyone interested in learning about the breeding aspect to do a search online. Free information! Each breed of rabbit has their own association and the best resources for breeding. This book has nice pictures, but all said and done I probably won't refer to the book much. Old and outdated also."
3,MMMM,"although I watched a video in youtube with a girl that seems to have my type of hair, it doesnt work for me at all."
2,Well,Hard to use. Need a lot of engine compartment room to use this tool. Might work great on a truck but don't buy it for your Acura Legend
2,Won't work with camshaft in place,"Couldn't find the Chrysler suggested spring compressor, bought this hoping it would work, the handle is right where most camshafts go. You'll have to pull the head or the engine or make your own compressor like I did"
4,Good valve removal tool,The tool works fine and was a good price. It is mainly for removing the valve spring and keepers on an engine that has the heads on it.
4,Issues with double valve springs,"This compressor is really cool and really easy to use. I had no trouble getting it onto the springs, but getting it properly adjusted to the height that would make the keepers become exposed was often a trick and took multiple attempts. The one issue I saw was that it had some issues with double valve springs... I managed to get it to work, but I wouldnt be too sure that I didnt just get lucky. The little tabs on the spring hooks don't quite extend in far enough for really positive engagement of that inner spring. In terms of durability, this thing is tough. I really reefed on it a couple times and had no metal deformation."
2,Empires: Dawn of the Modern World,"Horrible game, the graphics are weak, the game play is slow and the game does not measure up. Do not waste your money. I bought the game off the reviews I read here and I am so dissapointed. I am a heavy gamer and I by 2-3 games a month. By C & C generals & the Zero hour expansion. You will be much happier. Thumbs down for this game I should have bought the Lord of the rings game :(Cheep game for sale!"
1,Different Name Same Game,"Think before you buy folks, think about you've bought this type of game before, they added some new graphics, a touch up on the interface and basically just cut a portion out of the origional Empires and now are charging you another full fee for the same type of gameplay.If you have a handful of RTS games already, especially the origional Empires or RON or Age of Mythology or Warlords III, etc. etc. Unless you are just a fan(atic) for RTS games, you're just going to be spending extra money for nothing much extra.But, for RTS fan(atics) who just can have enough RTS games on their hard-drive, then of course nothing I say is going to stop you. But, hopefully those with slim pocket books will think twice and wait for this one to hit the bargain bin in about six months."
4,An excellent game - Mostly.,"This game is quite engaging. I spent several months completing the pre-defined missions which are quite interesting. The game has a few bugs that need the patch to be applied. In terms of strategy, overall the complexity is a 6/10. More realism could have been programmed in. For example in the Patton missions, it is possible to take a few rangers (two) and wipe out about 100 German troops, artillery and the pill boxes. Fuel constraints only come into play during the later missions. Fuel supply lines should be a part of all games. Anyway these are small complaints - the game is a lot of fun and better than AOE series in many respects."
1,This Game has Technical Problems,"Forget this game if you have an NVIDIA GeForce 4000 or higher video card. You will get a C++ Runtime Error every time the game loads. Activision is aware of the problem but has no solution. After two days trying unsucessfully to load the game, I threw it out!"
3,Supurb Multiplayer Experience,"Just a friendly note, Empires has supurb multiplayer, definately 5 stars for an RTS game, wether your playing a skirmish against the computer or over internet or LAN. The only downside to the multiplay is that there is a bug which makes you unable to make any buildings or units in the begining of each round. No patch has yet fixed it, and I encountered this bug roughly 1/5 of all the times I started a multiplayer roundThe single player campaign on the other hand is a complete forgetable monotone. Buy this game for the excelent multiplayer which I can guarentee will not dissappoint you."
3,Good,"I am an avid gamer and I have played many an rts over the years. This game uses one of my favorite rts engines, the titan. The games visuals are very good for such an old game. Everything though, sadly is average. It's fun and I personally like it a lot but it brings nothing new to the rts genre. If you're new to rts games you'll love it but if your not I suggest going with something else."
2,Another Age of Empires 2 imitation,"I bought this game thinking it would be innovative and extremely cool, very different of Empire Earth, the game before this. But I got disppointed. This game is just another copy of Age of Empires 2, it doesn't innovate anything.You can chose to play from the Middle-Ages to WWII, but none of the ages are cool. This is becouse of the stupid things in this game, for example a man taking shot of a tank and do not dying, or being hit by a cannon and the same thing happens. The game characters are always being hit and can't even notice that, they take shot and keep walking. Archers, cannons and anything that can shoot always hits their targets. Soldiers are bigger than airplanes.These factors appear also in many other rts before this one, but repeating the same mistakes is very stupid."
3,"an ok game, but needs major improvments!","Empires is an ok game, but it has its drawbacks. one, the only surface warship for WW1and 2 is a battleship. no destroyers or such. very few nations, few ages, not at all like Empire Earth 2! the game is freguently choppy, and isnt musch fun if every thing is jerky. i reccommend a lot of RAM for this game. another thing: u cant make more that 3 airports which can hold 15 aircraft! that is sooooooooooooooo agrivating! aaarrggghhh!! the campaignes are ok too, but are kind of confusing. overall, its kind of fun, but could be alot better! ONLY BUY THIS GAME IF U WANT OK EXPERIENCE OR HAV VERY FAST COMPUTER! IF NOT, BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
2,Multiplayer Stinks,The game is like a copy of Empire Earth but better. The graphics are horable and when i tried to play multiplayer with my brother over LAN you need to have 2 different versions of the game. The Single-Player games are great though.
4,"Read, met key subjects of book and it's near accurate.","I read the book, it was lent to me by one of the key players in the book ""Stan F."" and I was able to met two of the subjects in the book . I found it to be a very accurate accounting of the events that took place. Well worth reading. Depending upon the price I'd purchase it to have in my library."
4,Great Read,The books moves from the basics to the more complex. It would be a great book for new advisors.The authors do a great job of explaining a concept and then giving an example to drive the points home.
5,Works Great,"I lost the chuck key for my off brand corded drill and none of the keys for my other drills fit it. I took a shot in the dark with this key, and sure enough, it fits! I don't think I'll ever use the magnet, and wish they offered a cheaper version without it, but I'm still very happy with the product. I definitely recommend it if you've lost your chuck key."
5,perfect in its simplicity,Never thought about innovation in a chuck key until I bought this one. The four in one design and the magnet are very innovative.
1,Did not work for me,"I bought this to control insects that were destroying my marigolds and tomato plants. It has an odd smell that reminds me of lemons and onions. I tried using it as directed, and even tried it full strength. I grew tired of the odor, and the bugs continued their systematic destruction of my plants. In the end I was forced to use something else instead."
5,Saved my Plants!,"My plants were being eaten up by beetles and earwigs, so I sprayed all the affected plants with this product, once a week for 4 weeks. My plants are now thriving, with no sign of insect damage. It takes a little longer for this product to work, but it's well worth it because it targets only chewing insects and doesn't harm beneficial insects (just be sure to spray when the beneficials aren't active)."
3,The Brotherhood IV: The Complex,"The guys are hot, the music is pretty good. Even the acting is pretty OK.The story line is still a bit weak, but it is so much better than the previous 3 Brotherhood. The locker room solo is sexy. The underground tunnel scene should go one step further, instead it gets cut. The ending is always the weakest part of all Brotherhood series.Still I will watch it again soon."
5,A great intro to photography,"After doing photography my whole life with a point and shoot camera I finally bought a ""real"" camera. A Canon SLR that I had no idea how to use. So after a lot of research at the bookstore I settled on this book, and I am very happy I did. It teaches a beginner all the different important functions on your camera that you need to learn and why you need to know it. This book is very concise and detailed. All the functions on my camera are explained in detail in this book. If you have a new SLR that you don't know how to use I highly recommend this book."
4,nice reference for beginners,I found this book to be a nice reference for beginners like me. It does not require you to read it from cover to cover. You can pick and read any chapter you like. The illustrations are good enough and the book is not overfilled with them tunlike some other books that focus so much on illustrations that they never take time to write those simple concepts.I think its worth having this book on your shelf if you are gradually starting photography as a hobby.
3,not to the point.,"The book is huge and takes about 6 times longer to finish than a more condenced overview of photography, available much cheaper or for free on the web. And in my opinion, the book is very watery, missing many vital points, but going into endless descriptions of primitive techniques. Don't waste your time. My question to the ones who are raving about this book - go ahead and find an info on how to shoot using an intergrated meter reading a high contrast scene minding film altitude. it's basics and not covered at all!"
2,"Bad book - way too much text, few pictures","Avoid this book. It is way too verbose and has relatively few pictures and illustrations (and the few that there are, are in B&W not color). The Kodak educational photography series is MUCH better; Kodak publishes books for the amateur as well as professional. There are other books as well. Definitely skip this one."
2,Barely adequate and incomplete,"This publication features vague descriptions of photo concepts that makes it useless for reference. Possibly good for beginners, but if you are even an amateur photographer, you need a book that describes more in depth about filters, push processing, lenses, and chemicals. I was slightly disappointed and am still looking for a good reference book. For now, I am just googling concepts that I am trying to research. Works better than this book."
5,Perfect for beginners,"I've had a Nikon FG for 2 years now. I never imagined all the things that could be done outside of the program mode. This book has taught me ALOT! I'm sure the more expensive books are great, but for the price, I was astounded by the in depth details of the features most SLR cameras have. If you have a limited amount of money, and you are a beginner, this is a must read."
2,Meh . . . not what i expected,I remember having this book in high school when we did film photography and it was semi helpful it seemed more geared towards digital photography . So when i finally bought a Nikon D90 years later i remember how much information i thought this book had that could help me learn about photography more. I was wrong the book is super boring to read and i feel like its methods are so outdated. it is now sitting on a shelf unread.
5,Best Foot Care Ever!!!,"Living in dry Southern California AND having very dry skin, I find Barielle Total Foot Care Cream the BEST thing I have ever used to soften and moisten the bottoms of my feet!! It relieved me of any callouses I had and has kept them callous free. I also talked my husband into using it on his elbows which were VERY chapped and rough - his elbows became softened and have stayed that way. Yippee!!!"
5,This is a Fantastic cream!!!,"I have used this product for years and it is the greatest cream for your feet. Keeps them soft and beautiful, no ugly looking heels."
1,Fragrance is Overwhelming,"Don't buy this product unless you get the fragrance free version. The fragrance is so strong it gave both me and my husband sinus headaches. My husband got a headache from my using the product. He never used it. There other manufactures that make a similar product fragrance free. The key ingredient is urea, a moisture-binding ingredient that in greater amounts can help breakdown thickened, callused skin, making it remarkably smooth and soft.Unfortunatelly I had to throw this product out.JAC"
4,Pink Barielle,This thick pink cream goes a long way when applied. It does need to be worked in until fully absorbed.
5,the casette deck ate my tape!!,I stole this cassette from my Dad when I was in high school.....the best doors compilation ever...and of course I was playing it for the millionth time and it was eaten by my tape player. I have been searching for it ever since....I had no idea it was so rare. Such a bummer.
5,Leer en español series,"Listening to the CD's first, before you read the book is a fantastic way to practice your listening skills. Only problem is the books are published in Spain, so you need to get used to the Castellón accent. But that is also a good thing."
1,??,IT WAS TERRIBLE! I DIDN'T EVEN WEAR IT! IT LOOKED LIKE A HILLBILLY WITCH HAT. I HAD TO RE-VAMP MY WHOLE COSTUME. WISH I COULD RETURN IT.
2,A puzzle game...,"Is a puzzle game. What more can I write, but write that if you like a different styled 'Tetris' then jump right in."
3,THE ONE,THIS IS THE GAME YOU WANT AND NEED TO DOWNGRADE ANY PSP FROM A 3.5 TO 1.5. I FOUND IT AT MY LOCAL LIBRARY (for free) AND FOLLOWED ON LINE INSTRUCTIONS AND IT WORKED PERFECT. SO SAVE YOUR SELF THE 35 DOLLARS IF THATS ALL U WANT IT FOR AND TAKE A TRIP TO THE YOUR LOCAL BOOK EMPORIUM!
5,The best PSP game ever.,"Lumines is great. I hate Tetris, even though this game is pretty much exactly like it. It was boring for the first 5 minutes, but then it got HIGHLY addicting. Time goes by very fast playing this game. The music is exellent, just jack in the headphones and you'll be playing for a long time."
4,"Classic, Simple, Quality Tested Gameplay","If you liked Tetris you'll like Lumines. Its been updated with good dance tracks, good videos, flawless game play and performance. Like any falling block game it can be a bit redundant - but mostly its just addictive and a far sight more stimulating than titles where significantly less time and attention to detail was spent during development."
4,Addiction to the music...and the game!,"Lumines is a game that you MUST play with the audio on. More than even WipEoutPure, the audio is an integral part of the game and is a tale of why the PSP is perfect for it. It should really be THE pack-in game for the PSP (if there were one). The only thing I think it's missing is the level of extras and unlockables that WipEout gives us."
1,THE TRUTH BEHIND LUMINES,"Lumines has some of the most addicting music and visuals i have ever seen on a game. Every time you move the blocks or get them cleared from the screen they make a beet to the current music playing. Little animations in the background are amazing and funny. But what they dont tell u is that this game is hard! THIS GAME IS HARD ! ! ! I bought this game a week ago and played it for an hour, i was only able to get to level two. The game is fast and confusing. I RECOMEND U RENT BEFORE U BUY. If u are good at it, then love it to death. But if ur like me and want a game that you can at least be able to play then dont buy. I would just like to know how in the world some of these people are even able to play it."
1,This game stinks unless you live by puzzle games.,"I liked the original tetris. Not to complex, pretty addicting. I even liked bust a move. So with all the good reviews of this game, I thought I'd give it a spin. I did and regretted it immediately. This is way to complex to catch on in any similar fashion to tetris. Your grandma could play tetris or bust a move. She will never get this game.Bottom Line: Polarity blows this one out of the water on the DS. Will I keep it? Nope. Is it for kids? Nope. Too complex."
2,$40 for a Tetris clone??,"I couldn't disagree more with the other reviewers. I played this a bit at my local Best Buy store and I simply couldn't understand why anyone would pay $40 (plus sales tax) for a Tetris game, because this is what Lumines ultimately is. Yes, it's got tons of eye candies and funky music tracks, but the gameplay is essential Tetris. Maybe I didn't spend enough time with it to discover its ""depth"", but I'll never pay $40 for a Tetris game."
1,What? Better than tetris? YOU got to be kidding!!!,"I bought it because of all the good review. But after spending 5 weeks with game, I cannot imagin how on earth this game has such a good review. I mean wherever you see on the net, it has pretty good rating for no good reason.As far as I'm concern, this is only a spin-off from tetris. Nothing more!!!"
5,very addicitve,At first I thought that this game was going to not hold my attention - now when I am not playing it my son is...totally addictive...as a matter of fact it my turn so I can't type more.
5,Dont judge a book by its cover (and price!),Amplitude+Tetris+PuyoPop+funk+56$+Tax= LuminesThats the only way to put it!!!
4,Courageous attempt to build bridges,"This is an excellent attempt to disentangle the many historical layers that gave rise to anger and hate among the three monotheistic religions that were born in the Middle East.Instead of the usual intellectually lethargic accounts, which often find the origins of such hatred in the tenets of one of the three religions, Judaism, Christianity or Islam, Armstrong traces the roots of many attitudes and assumptions that fueled war among these religions in various historical episodes. An Englishwoman and an ex-nun, the author delves into the history of the Church with courageous energy to explore what few dare to contemplate. Most interesting."
1,Absolute Drivel,"This must be the single worst book on midieval history I have ever read. I read the book, then started again, taking notes on the mistakes and false assumptions the author made. By the time I was on the ninth page, I already had 3 pages of notes. She does not know who Abraham was, makes false assumptions about Moses, completely derides and mocks the Judeo-Christian religions, and praises and raves the merits of Jihadist Islam. I can't stand historians, even poor ones, who attempt to re-interpete history to fit a personal bias. This would have been an excellent book, if it had been written by someone else."
1,WHAT???,What on earth is she talking about? There seems to be no real focus in this book. She jumps around more then a hyperactive three year old. She also seems to have a complete bias against the christians.(Bad experiance as a nun perhaps?) All I have to say if it was not required matterial for school I would never have picked it up.
1,"How do you spell ""propaganda""","Armstrong's thesis is that it is perfectly right and proper for rampaging hordes of murdering, pillaging and raping Muslims armies to sweep out of the primitive barrens of Arabia and rape the more advanced civilizations they found in the Middle East. Ms. Armstrong wants us to believe that millions of Christians and Jews who lived in the Middle East prior to 700 A.D. converted to Islam because of its merits rather than the armies of Mohammed and his successors.However, when Christian monarchs swept through the Middle East fighting to reclaim territory it was an historical crime. Real peace means acknowledging the Muslim world's narcissistic claim that, they and only they, have the Divine Right to Rule under their Perfect religion.Try reading Jihad by Paul Fregosi for a dose of reality."
4,It's all about perspective,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that Karen Armstrong ignores the earlier wave of Islamic conquest in North Africa and the Levant. While not a dispassionate history, the strength of Ms. Armstrong's work is in its ability to illuminate a different historical perspective to western audiences, most of whom know very little about the Muslim perspective. This is particularly important; the average Muslim, Arab or otherwise, does view recent history as yet another western incursion, and it's important to understand this. By all means read more about the history of Islam, and read too about the Balfour declaration and the British role in early 20th century Palestine. It's important to know more about all these things. Still, Ms. Armstrong has done an excellent job of illuminating the Muslim perspective, and it is for this that 'Holy War' is most valuable."
5,Well dug out,"I am impressed with Karen's ability to dig out facts and present them in a very subtle manner, she has once again proven herself in this BooK, I felt she had the least amount of bias towards any side in her book."
4,Did Pope Urban II cause 911?,"History with triple vision. It makes sense, three religions, three visions. Karen Armstrong looks at the Crusades from the Christian, Jewish and Islamic viewpoints. And indeed you can see three diffrent Crusades.According to the author Crusading has survived in diffrent forms (in the USA and Europe) and distorts our present view of Arabs and Jews, thus you need the ""triple vision"".If you have limited time for reading Karen Armstrong's books about the Middle East, this book covers a lot of what is also covered in her books ""Muhammed"" and ""Islam"".I subtract one star, because she intentionally fails to discuss the economic and military aspects of the Holy Wars, leaving out such important elements of history is bound to add another distortion even with triple vision."
2,Very well written but extremely biased in view,"I have read many books about the Crusades and ""Holy War"" is by far the most biased book I have read about them. Karen Armstrong is an apologist for the Islamic world. The Islamic expansionary wars under the Umayyad caliphate of the 7th and 8th centuries are viewed with respect and understanding whereas the crusades to retake these once Christian lands are seen as atrocious. I realize that mostly Westerners will be reading this book, and perhaps that is why she goes out of her way to ""side"" with the Muslims, to try and make us understand their viewpoint. But she goes too far with this, not only by discrediting crusading achievements but by leaving out essential facts that would threaten to tarnish the Muslim image she has created."
1,Typical Armstrong,"The saddest part is that pc colleges will probably put this book on their course, and gullible students who know next to nothing about history will walk away believing that the Crusades are the source of all the woe in the Middle East. Most amazing is the tone and adjectives used: when talking about the Muslim conquests which began nearly 500 years BEFORE the Crusades, and which annexed so many formerly Christian lands, including Jeruslamem, her tone is very upbeat, almost as if to say ""Allah willed it."" When, on the other hand, talking about the Crusades--which were simply a belated response to centuries of Muslim aggression--woe, all is woe! What a massive axe this former nun has to grind!"
5,Overlooking the obvious,"There are some things that are easy to overlook for being so obvious: Ms. Armstrong's thesis - tracing back the current Middle East crisis to its roots in the Crusades, and before - is a wonderful summary for the Western readers, who may ""know"" the subject but mainly through its more romantic (and, as she shows, perversely distorted) history. She has a way of telling the old tales (plus adding some news ones) that's a continual challenge to ""get past"" our limited cultural boundaries."
4,Prejudiced reviews,"I have noticed that many who review karen armstrong's book & this one in specific, generally expect a complete christian victory & anything that balances the view is considered biased & untrue.It is not a matter of who invaded the other first but what practices did the invader indulge in. Neither Islam nor Christianity condone invasions so we are dealing with a profane subject, a human trait not a religious one. Europeans simply used religion in their invasion of the levant & started a 2 century conflict that does resonate till today in the middle eastern pysche, though it should move on from that point, but obviously there are readers who are displeased to read that during the crusades the muslims were actually more civil than the christians. facts are hard sometimes & some cannot handle it, like some muslims today who think they are right on everything. karen Armstrong always writes with eloquence & clarity, her writings till now are very balanced no matter what some may say."
4,Great buy for David Beckham fans!!,This is a really interesting look at the years that David Beckham has spent at Man U. The one thing that got a little repetitive was the fact that they showed allll of his goals. If they had more interviews and just some overviews I would have given it 5 stars. Even though some parts are long its a great look at David Beckham's career!!!....So ENJOY IT!!
1,Highway robbery!,"For the price it costs for 10 packs ($1 total without shipping), you get slammed with a $50 delivery charge.Amazon needs to do a better job of stamping out sellers like this. Shameful."
2,"SAD, SAD ATTEMPT, CRIS!","hAVING ADORED CRIS WILLIAMSON'S ALBUM, NOW FOR OVER 2 DECADES, I HAVE TOREPORT THIS NEW C.D. IS A REAL LET-DOWN!!!hOPING FOR AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE ""ASHES"" C.D. , HER LAST ALBUM , I FOUND THIS , MOSTLY ACOUSTIC ALBUM A SAD LY WEAK ALBUM OF SONGS!!pLEASE , CRIS,, GIVE US ANOTHER 2wolf MOON"" TYPE ALBUM!please!!!!"
4,"Good, but frame rate seems a little off.","Borg was my idol when I was beginning to play tennis, so I have enjoyed watching this match. The editing was good, but it seemed that the frame rate was a little off. Borg and Mac seemed a little ""robotic"" like the editor decided to speed up time by about 15%. Still enjoyable."
3,My How Tennis Has Changed!,"Somewhat underwhelming. There were a few good shots back then, but it's amazing how much faster, harder, and more exciting today's tennis is. You feel like you are really watching an antique. Low production values on the film as well. Boring old English announcers. Slow pace. But interesting for historical value if you are a student of the game."
5,My all time favorite wildlife book,"If you have ever had any curiosity about wild animals, any interest in what raccoons are really like... or just looking for a well written, informative and different book - THIS is a must read!"
5,Great Book!,I love this book. I'm so glad it was available. It's easy to pick up and read for a while before bed.
4,Made me happier than a raccoon in an alley full of dumpsters!,"This book is a godsend for introverts like myself who dislike interacting with people while at the same time believing raccoons to be some of the most engaging and delightful beings in God's kingdom. I'd give this the full five stars if not for the art direction. To say the cover photo is off-putting is to say raccoons are cute - correct, but a vast understatement."
1,Huge plot holes,"I usually love Miller's books but found this one to be poorly written. The plot holes were gaping and the devices were not worthy of an author of Miller's caliber. For example, Kristina wonders if she'll one day be able to bear a child since she has never menstruated and awakens the next morning with cramps. Puh-leeze...Skip this one."
5,Great cd,"I really enjoyed this cd. It was fun, especially Good Day! It is an album that my kids and I can all ejoy together. My favorite is Slowly. Good Day is my kids' favorite. All of their little friends know the words to it now. They have heard it at the local skating rink, along with A Shame. Good luck, Shyan! You will go far if you continue on the path that you are on! I purchased your cd at Sounds Familiar on Parklane."
4,useful but limiting,"This product is great, my computer and room are about 50-75ft from each other and the connection speed is wonderful. There are a few problems: the wireless extender stops transmitting data and you have to go uplug the remote unit and plug it back in within about 8 seconds or the connection will be lost. Also when you switch it from computer to game and back i have been having some troubles. this product is great but nyko could have spent more time working out the kinks."
2,bad job staying connected,"I bought this product 9 months ago and used it to go online with my ps2. It connected but it kept on losing the connection everytime i play games like socom 2,socom 3, killzone, and other ps2 online games. I bought the logitech network extender and used that to get online. This product was similar to the nyko product. It worked well and it was free from losing connections. If your planing on playing online with easy hook ups then I would recommend the logitech network extender intstead of this product."
2,Do i need a ps2 network adaptor to hook this up????,Do i need a ps2 network adaptor to hook this up????I have looked every where for this answer! pleez answer me in a review...thanx
2,OK,"I loved Lucy, but these later series were not so great. You can't go wrong ordering this but her earlier show, The Lucy Show is far better."
5,Continued Briliance,"Keith Ablow continues to amaze me, every time I pick up on eof his novels I have to fight myself put them down. Frank Clevenger is one of fictions greatest heros. Ablow has created a character you can feel and connect with. With a plot that grabs you out of the gate Psychopath and keeps you glues to the pages. I anxiously await whatever masterful work that Ablow writes next everytime I finish one of his current masterworks."
1,What a Waste~,This book was such a disappointment! It starts off really slow - and then it picks up and gets interesting but the ending really stinks big time. If you can - read the very last page and judge for yourself. I do not understand why so many readers really enjoyed his writing. This is definitely not Grisham.
5,Read em all.,This is the second book I have read from Keith Ablow. His charactors are as real as John Sandfords in his prey series. How the mind works? For normal people and for the not so normal.Great read. After I read Condi Vs. Hillary I'll be back to more Ablow books.
4,Right path.,"While there were a few flaws or weaknesses this time - some letters fictionally published in the ""New York Times"" contained language that I doubt the Times would have accepted under any circumstances, as well as a disappointing lack of character development of supporting character North Anderson - this novel still emerged as my favorite thriller so far this year (with Lee Child maintaining a close second). As other reviewers have noted, forensic psychiatrist Frank Clevenger seems to have quelled many of his personal demons this outing. Just in time to meet up with a character who may prove to be his opposite number. After this, what remains? One could only fantasize of having Ablow & Harris team-up and allow Clevenger & Lector to cross paths."
5,Ablow Rocks!,Ablow is one of the most prolific serial killer writers on the market today. His expertise in the field of forensic psychology is meticulously expressed in his writing. Most of the characters (both the protagonists and antagonists) are case studies in and of themselves. I highly recommend Ablow for the serial killer connoisseur. You wont be disappointed!
1,badly remastered,"""The Complete Rachmaninoff', at 2-3 times the price is a better deal. This version is re-mastered in a way that reduces surface noise, but, at the same time, removes much of the pianists' tone quality that comes through so well on the original LP release, as well as the more expensive set. Also, this album is lacking the documentation of recording dates that the LP and 'The Complete Rachmaninoff' provide. For the neophyte, the re-mastering reduces the magic of Rachmaninoff's tone. I would expect the connoisseur to be even more disappointed. There are bargains out there, but for this album, you get what you pay for."
2,not what I expected,"This appears to be a very comprehensive box set, however, it isn't what I expected. The sound quality is poor. This is understandable since the original recordings were done many decades ago, but still not very nice to listen to. And the recordings are not in any recognizable order, a little Chopin here, a little Rachmaninoff there, a little Debussy, a little more Chopin... Admittedly, I am not a great authority, but this set doesn't do him justice."
5,One Of The Best!,"This is one of the most engaging, fun and funny romances I've ever read. I want to find Jack Madden and take him home with me!Debrah Morris is on my keeper shelf and on my auto-buy list."
4,Great Vac!,"I love my vac - it is very powerful. I can reach the ceiling and windows with the hose. However, the vac blows hot air out of the back. So you need to be careful not to point the vac in a location that hasn't been cleaned yet - otherwise you'll be blowing dust into the air."
1,Not what I expected it to be,"Loved it the first 4 times I used it (hence the single star). I was all downhill from there. The power head died. Company authorized a local shop to replace it, and they did so. Shop thought it was a bearing, but it was actually a defect in the housing as well. Process took 2 weeks and cost me $50. New powerhead died after exactly 6 minutes of use. I'm going to junk it as I can't afford to maintain it. Required postage to use the company's warrenty is $40 each time, and is only good for a year. Guess I got a lemon."
4,New Again!,"I disagree in a way with Mr. North Salem. Hasnt he ever heard that everything old is new again? I have spent recent time in the West Village, and the scene is the same with a different list of characters. RACING SEPTEMBER takes you there. Loved the action and the true dialogue. Book style reminds me of early Elmore Leonard."
3,Dissapointing,"It's great to have this full score containing the very best of Mendelssohn's works, but this edition was terrible, (of course reprinted from the Breitkopf and Hartel editions). I really liked that there were all the play cues for the incidental music to A Midsummer Night's Dream, but this book wasn't bound with the immortal glue Dover books are bound with tody. My 406 paged book is in pieces with a bunch of errors in it. This was a waste of $20. I don't know the other editions of Mendelssohn's works, but I don't really like his music that much anyway. At the time I just wanted to have references to the flute solo from the Scherzo."
3,Human Growth and Development-C Beckett,I bought this book as prep for CLEP test. I found I needed to study from a regular textbook to make sure I had the info I needed to pass the exam. For my purposes it really was not comprehensive enough.
3,Great book for Navigator. Not good for Internet Explorer,"This is a great book about Javascript. The author provided good introduction to all of the subjects before he discussed them, helping the reader to understand better.My only problem with the book is that it doesn't reflect IE. Navigator's and IE's Javascript interpreter (engine) is vastly different, and the book primarily discusses Navigator. Given the market conditions, IE has surpassed Navigator and I'm at this point targeting development more for IE rather than Navigator. As a result, most of the code examples were inoperable in IE.I would love to see a newer edition where he concentrates on IE's Javascript interpreter."
4,One of the few books that lives up to its title,"A truly outstanding reference for professional Web developers. The only JavaScript reference book I consistently turn to when I have a problem. The fact that I carry this with me wherever I go, despite its weight, offers a testament to its value in my work."
5,My favorite Javascript text...,"This is a great read for web developers that know the basics of JavaScript and need a desk reference. I think that this is a great example of how O'Reilly has created a book series that creates a loyal group of O'Reilly readers. Hands down, the Rhino is my favorite JavaScript reference."
4,Excellent syntax; Low examples,"I agree with many of the writers so far. I find that the book is an excellent reference and a great way to learn javascript functions and methods.However, the lack of examples hurts the book tremendously and often prevents the reader from applying what they learn to real world examples. Nonetheless, I find myself going back to this book over and over again to solve my javascript problems because it is a great reference.As for the cover, don't judge a book . . . Once it is opened you don't see the cover anymore. As a philosophical aside, it is this type of logic that keep people from understanding those that are different than themselves.Overall, I have enjoyed this book and continue to use it today.I would like thicker pages though so that my highliter doesn't show up on the other side."
4,Definitive but Could be more Functional,"A great book, but I would've preferred ""how to's"" that covered common JavaScript uses, like rollovers. A little ""cookbook"" information would truly make this the ""definitive"" guide. Buy it anyway. O'Reilly books are extremely well-written. The best, in fact. Many computer books look like a bunch of technical gobbledygook when you open them up. O'Reilly books read like BOOKS."
4,An invaluable reference for web development,"Put simply, it is the definitive guide. This book starts with the basics of the language and then progresses through each individual piece of it in detail. It takes the time to point out the differences in implementation between browsers, which is very helpful, especially when using the book as a reference during debugging. The only thing I found lacking in the book were short, easy to understand examples of the language in action. While it does have enough code snippets in it to illustrate the general points, it does not show some of the more interesting parts of the language."
5,Double Duty,"I found this an excellent introduction to programming with Javascript (I did have experience in other languages). But even after becoming comfortable with the introductory concepts, I continue to use this book as a desktop reference. The entries are easy to follow and contain just the right amount of information on the command or object I'm looking up."
3,Not that Great for Beginners,"I took a beginning JavaScript class through another entity and was told to buy this book. I was not only unhappy with the class, but also quite unhappy with the book. It's a great reference book, but not a learning tool for beginners. At this point, I have no suggestions for other books."
2,Wordy and not enough examples,"This is a technical book, but when reading it, I feel as if I am reading a novel. After reading a definition on something, I was kind of hung in the middle without any example or demonstration. Most of the examples are too short that I don't know where the information come from"
3,Not a fun read,"The book is poorly laid out, and the examples are not explained thoroughly. I already knew Java, so I was able to pick up JavaScript without a large struggle, but if I hadn't known Java, I would have quit reading the book about 10 pages in. One plus is the extensive reference section (200 pages)."
3,"Excellent Reference section, but TERRIBLE examples","In my opinion, an example should serve to illustrate a conceptthat's just been presented. This book, however, frequently uses examples to introduce new information while provide little supplemental help to make sense of this new info. This makes for a very frustrating learning experience!..."
2,Not good for beginner!!!,"This book is not for beginners. If you try to learn JavaScript from scratch, this is not the book for you.Try others. I only have little knowledge of JavaScript, I can not understand what this book try to convey. Lengthy description without good examples. It tells you a lot of things you don't need to know.The author likes to compare C/C++/CGI.. in this book in order to illustrate something I don't even care. Those readers who gave five stars to this book have already have great knowledge of JavaScript before they read this book (they forgot to mention that to you) or they are just genius. The only thing I find it useful is the reference."
3,"Not bad, could be better","I've got a real problem with this traditional-computer science approach of learning all about variables and structure but nothing that you can actually use.This book is better than the previous book I tried, but it still doesn't allow you to really practice the code to learn it (to me, the only way you can really learn). It starts out really good, but still spends too much time on variables and structure and not enough real world code. The cookbook (additional book) is helpful but the code is too complex to learn Javascript on your own.Look, books don't seem to be doing a very good job. If you want to learn Javascript, goto Yahoo.com and search for Javascript tutorial. I've just tried a few, but in an hour or two I've learned 20x as much as trying to read the book."
4,Windows Host Script not mentioned,"The book is good, but does not touch new application of JavaScript - Windows Host Script, MS scripting control."
1,Weak Document Object Model examples and explanation,"But I am too busy to enjoy reading through mountains of pages to find what I need. This book is especially weak with trivial examples, and their (D)ocument (O)bject (M)odel explanation section was especially shallow. Index was not so intuitive either, since you must already know the keyword of what you are looking for. This book is great for theoreticans and academic people. I need a book to get my work done quickly as I have too much to do. The technically depth was atypical of Oreilly."
3,good for beginners but a waste for experienced,this book teaches you the syntax of javascript really well but in terms of actually applying it to web scripting i felt it did a horrible job. if you're looking to learn javascript from scratch then this would be a good book to buy but if you already know javascript and want a book that has more advanced or web related topics then i'd probably take a look at goodman's book.
3,Focus on IE Minimal & Not Enough Examples,"Navigator may have been THE browser back in 96 when the book was first written, but this third edition came out in 98 when IE was fast taking over. I think it's a bit deceptive that the title doesn't indicate the strong Netscape Navigator bias. The end result is that I have to go out and get another book for JavaScript under IE. Pity! Also there's a lot of prose and not enough complete examples that one can try."
2,Disappointing and disorganized,"I bought this book hoping to finally have a complete Javascript reference. You know, the kind that lists the objects, then their properties and has a good index. At first glance this book appears to fill the bill, but after using it for some time I find myself going back to Goodman's ""Javascript Bible"". There is something half-baked in the organization of this book that makes it hard to find anything when I'm looking for it. In short, this is not the definitive guide, but merely one of several books you'll need on hand to program in Javascript. *Sigh*"
3,Thorough tech reference,"This book is a very complete reference for the Javascript languge. It pays particular attention to the incompatibilities that plague the different interpreters/browsers. The book is fairly well written; it doesn't cause your eyes to glaze over from jargon overload. However, it also sometimes underestimates the skill and experience of the targetted reader, IMHO. Considering that this language is predominantly used for scripting web sites, I expected something a little different: more concentration on application and examples and less repetition of fundamental programming concepts and definitions.Still, this book does a good job at cataloging the syntax and features of the language. It will probably be a very helpful book for people who are new to programming and want to learn a scripting language."
4,Thorough guide with good reference,"This book is not for users new to writing code. However, if you have some programming experience, you will find this an excellent source to improve and learn about JavaScript. About half of the book details how the objects, functions and events work in the language. There are some good examples of code in this section but it is mostly reading. The second half of the book is a solid reference section covering everything you could want to know. My only complaint is that the reference section shows the syntax for a JavaScript keyword but it doesn't give many examples of thier use. This can result in bad code because of a slight syntax error due to misunderstanding. However, that's only a minor complaint. The reference section is solid and detailed. There may be a better JavaScript book than this, but I haven't seen it."
3,Good and reliable,"I needed to learn Javascript in a hurry, and by many accounts this one was the way to go. I wasn't disappointed. The book is well-oragnized, easy to go through, complete and works well as a reference. No muss, no fuss."
2,A Intro book for Beginners - NOT,"It's been said in other reviews. The book is great for reference. However, if you're new to Javascript, this is not the book for you. The author explains concepts in abstract detail. Then, he either doesn't give an example, or his examples are so arcane (i.e., trigonometry or some other obscure math example) that it doesn't clarify the concept he is trying to present. I hope O'Reilly realizes it's missing a marketing opportunity. How about a book for someone trying to Learn Javascript without a great deal of programming experience?"
4,I like the cover...,"The cover is great. Nothing like a Javanese Rhino to make me whip a book off the shelf. I do not think this is a good beginner's book, though, but once you know what you're doing, it's the thing to sink your braincells into. Absolute beginners should check out something like Javascript Goodies by Joe Burns or an online tutorial."
3,This one is OK,Its pretty lengthy and Javascript has developed some since this came out so I don't know how usefull it still is.
1,Worthless.,"It's big all right, but completely lacking in practical substance. Read this book and you'll give up before you even start coding. The most basic components of the language, such as datatypes, expressions, variables, etc., are explained in painful and excruciating detail, while solid, useful code examples are absent, presumably left as an exercise to the reader. The large reference section, which at least has some value because it lists all of the methods and properties, reads like the Unix man pages, all crytic explanations with no examples.If you already know how to code but just not in JavaScript, choose JavaScript for the World Wide Web by Tom Negrino and Dori Smith to get you started with basic examples of the sort of tasks suited to JavaScript (field validation, rollovers, cookies, etc). For a more detailed text, try JavaScript Interactive Course by Arman Danesh."
1,Too much text!,"Perhaps this book *does* define every last aspect of JavaScript, but for the novice programmer, or someone who just wants to get started and write simple scripts, this book is heavy going. Chapter after chapter of detailed (and sometimes over-complicated) English explanantions would be more interesting with visual examples (like the Visual Quickstart guides, for example). We're all trying to produce code for a fun visual environment, but with its lack of supporting visual examples and lack of code examples, this book just didn't make me feel interested."
1,Weak Document Object Model examples and explanation,"But I am too busy to enjoy reading through mountains of pages to find what I need. This book is especially weak with trivial examples, and their (D)ocument (O)bject (M)odel explanation section was especially shallow. Index was not so intuitive either, since you must already know the keyword of what you are looking for. This book is great for theoreticans and academic people. I need a book to get my work done quickly as I have too much to do. The technically depth was atypical of Oreilly. Thye should include a complex application multi-windows multi-framset web application that controlling each other through functions and variable assignments. Anyway, who are these happy 5 stars people programming?"
4,very helpful sourcebook,"Lists a vast number of resources. The introductions to the sections give good orientations to the issues involved in choosing products and processes. Would prefer a more thorough index, although in-depth table of contents serves as a type of index as well. Well worth the price."
1,very poor recording quality,"Even though there are 3 cds, the recording quality is not worth the money. It is unpleasant to listen to."
4,Can't Find the Clips,"The idea behind this book is great, however, good luck locating ORANGE and BLACK paperclips. Multipacks sell every color BUT these. Sometimes they have black, but I have yet to see an orange clip. They should have taken this into consideration when choosing colors for the book!PS. If anyone FINDS these colors on line, please let me know!!"
2,Goofy Movie,"I rented this movie because I was bored yesterday. This movie is aimed at teens and young adults. Because it has sexual meanings;and of guys with shirts off a lot. Then you have this girl in the movie lusting after guys while your hearing music that sounds like porn music almost. The movie took forever to get to the point of finding out who Robert Hyde was. Here is three words that explains this movie.Goofy, Cheesy, Cheap effects and cheesy acting"
2,made for TV malaise,"The other reviews provide a comprehensive plot assessment. My review is to share my view on the overall value and worth of watching this movie - none. While the story is somewhat ok, its definitely a made for TV movie, think Lifetime and all its bland lackluster boringness. This is no different. There a certain sheen lacking from made for TV movies; they lack production value pop, acting intrigue and all the other elements that separate the good movies from average movies. While some folks might enjoy this movie, its a relative question to me - there are thousands of movies out there, so why spend your time on a clearly inferior one?"
1,Even worse than the other David DeCoteau films,"I've basically discovered David DeCoteau films are like PG rated man eye candy, with a bit of homoeroticism thrown in. ""Killer Bash"" has better production values than the other films of his I've seen, but the plot is SOO slow. It misses the major cheese/camp factor of the other films, and that factor is what makes the others films at least watchable. Check outVoodoo AcademyorThe Frightening. The mom in the latter is far scarier than anything you'll find in ""Killer Bash.""To give you an idea of how slowly paced this movie is, the main character looks at a stack of yearbooks and it takes her over five seconds to run her fingers down the sequentially yeared books to find the 1975 volume. Rub your finger on something for five seconds: it's a LONG time, especially to point at a book that's in its proper order."
3,Great show - Poor DVD quality,"I got my copy today. Parker Lewis fans won't be disappointed. However, I wish the DVD quality was better. It looks like it was recorded straight from the TV..."
5,A++,"Received this item very fast, which was important because it was a Christmas gift, very happy with item!! Had plenty of time to wrap, item was in great condition!"
2,Great show horrible transfer quality,"It is a good show, if you are looking at this you already know what its about. The only problem and it is a BIG problem is the quality of transfer to DVD. It stinks, I had old copies of the show I had made on VHS while it was on TV and the quality of those after all these years of fading is about the same or better than the DVD quality. When I first tried to watch it I thought my DVD player or TV was messed up, it was that bad. The worst part of the movie are the times when they froze the image and continue on with the talking or audio, at those points you really see how bad the transfer was... frankly I would suggest passing on this one because of quality of the transfer alone. Go look for a VHS copy of it and you'll find better quality than the DVD. VERY VERY disappointed."
4,Synchronize swatches!,"I loved this show as I grew up and it's likely to be incredibly dated by today's standards. Still, nostalgia has a place in my life which means Parker Lewis does as well! Synchronize swatches!"
4,This book is a celebration.,"An extended American family celebrates a traditional 4th of July, in this lovely picture book. Starting the day with a children's parade, enjoying pizza and popcorn, buying tickets for a raffle, then enjoying carnival activities, face painting, balloons, and finally ending the day with a barbecue, and concert under the stars with fireworks finale, the family has a wonderful time celebrating Independence Day. The illustrations are a little hazy, very nostalgic and timeless, with colors that depict the warmth and fun of the day. Any child who has ever attended a city park 4th of July celebration will recognize the activities depicted here. The text is short and simple enough to be included in a patriotic themed storytime for preschoolers. This will be a great addition to a holiday collection for which not that many books for children have been written."
3,reinforces an unfortunate stereotype,"This is a nice book about how people celebrate the Fourth of July, and it captures the excitement and the community celebration.But... and I speak now from my own perspective. We are a military family, so we *really* celebrate America. Read through this book and tell me, is July 4th for white people?I hear that sometimes. This group has Cinco de Mayo and Dia de los Muertos. That group has Juneteenth. And July 4th is for white people.This book reinforces that stereotype. One illustration has a cub scout and a Lady Liberty participating in the celebration -- these children seem to have been chosen for their diversity, eh? Good grief.This phenomenon is not so pervasive among our military communities, but out in America, I hear that stereotype more and more often.Independence Day is for all Americans. More melting pot, please."
1,What the hell is this? A Johnny Cash-in..,"While Johnny Cash is a complete legend, the epitome of ""white man blues"", this set is nothing more than a cash-in of his recent resurgence! The tracks in this set are remixed heaps of junk that, sound nothing like this original. Stay clear of this if you want pristine original records and not some junk. Cheers"
1,Mechanical and Electrical Systems in Buildings (3rd Edition),"This book is terrible. If you are a certified HVAC specialist, it is for you. However, if you are new to this then it is a total waste of money. Explanation is bad, example are nowhere relate to the section discussed. And worst of all, there is no answer keys. You will not have a clue if you are correct or not. Every chapter there are as least half of the review question are calculations, yet in each chapter there will be probably one page showing how calculation is done. Example one of the simplest thing:COP = Cooling Effect / Power Input. If you look up the index, you cannot find the word ""cooling effect"", find out whichever chapter they discuss, or show you how to calculate the ""cooling effect"".You are in luck if you do not have class that uses this book. You have bad luck if you have a ""good"" teacher that using this book. You are doom if you have a ""bad"" teacher who using this book, might as well drop it. Waste of time and money."
4,DieHard Cub Fan,"For all the diehard Cub fans out there, this is a very good book. It's a great reference book and very enjoyable to read."
4,concrete jungle and war no more trouble,"track labelled war is actually concrete jungle on mp3 download.track labelled heathen is actually war no more trouble.these are the two best songs on the album. all the songs are good, but war and concrete jungle are standouts.i have many live recordings from the apollo, roxy, santa barbara, australia, london, rotterdam, etc.big ship by freddie mcgregor is a great song if you like reggae and are over saturated with marley and need other reggae hits"
2,look elswhere,"I purchased this printer for the primary objective of printing retail sales labels.The paper is fed into the machine by one larger roller. Regardless of the type of paper, it will not feed properly. Everything is printed on an angle and I've complied with all of customer supports recommendations.Also, If you're looking for detail in your images this is not the printer for you. There are lil specs of red, blue, and green that appear throughout the image and is very noticeable on whites.This is my second printer in a quest to find one suitable and I'm now searching for my third."
1,Highly overpriced poor map,"This map was a terrible disappointment. It leaves out whole important sections of the city (the Giudecca, even the Lido!), gives only the main streets (thus making it much easier to get lost in an already maze-like place), and leaves out vital information found on standard tourist maps, such as water-bus (vaporetto) routes and opening times for museums. My advice: save your money and get a decent map for a few bucks when you get to Venice."
2,Was expecting more,"This is a Venice street map, laminated, folding into standard envelope size item. You can get essentially the same thing, only without lamination, from a tourist bureau while in Venice for free. A good product, but not an essential one to buy ahead of your trip to Venice - get it there."
4,You Really Need A Good Map in Venice,"I usually have a great sense of direction and Venice is the first city I've ever vacationed where I actually got lost when there was still daylight. If I didn't have this map, it would have been much worse.The map has it's problems but that has more to do with the streets of Venice which have long names that often change every block. I don't blame the map-makers. I think that they did the best they could while keeping the map smallish: it folds out to 8.5 inches X 19 inches. (It is 8.5 inches X 4 inches folded up.) This map is much better than the maps included in the Venice travel book we bought (""Top Ten Venice""), and I'm glad we bought it. We'd truly have been lost without it."
5,Great Map of Venice,"And sturdy to carry around with you. But if you're older, you will need reading glasses!"
2,Limited worth for the price,"On a recent visit to Venice I used the Streetwise Venice map. Though I found the plastic coating beneficial during a rain shower, the map was of limited value. Because of its size, street names were often illegible. The northern part of the city was cut off from the map and therefore gave me no help in exploring that part of the city where so many of the locals live. Far better to pick up one of the free maps given out by the tourist office, or available in almost all of the hotels."
1,Horrible Abuse of Technological Jargon,"This book was horrible. Technical jargon was thrown around to make things seem accurate, but was horribly abused. People familiar with TRON will recognize the idea of throwing around viruses as though they were balls.The writing style was childish and often full of word abuse, as has been noted by other reviewers. The characters are undeveloped and all the good guys think and act exactly the same: buck the establishment investigators who make lots of really good guesses. Deus ex machina to the extreme.The amount of belief that must be suspended, especially by someone remotely familiar with modern computers, goes far beyond my tolerance for something that is supposed to take place within the decade.If you want to read some high-tech fiction, read Neal Stephenson. He requires suspension of some belief, but writes much better and has characters with depth."
3,Berglund Center for Internet Studies Review by Jeffrey Barlow,"In our endless search for popular fiction authors who deal seriously with the Internet and whose works might further our understanding of its impact, we were bound to encounter R. J. Pineiro. Our search, however, does not end with this book... In general, Tor Books, the imprint for Pineiro's works, appears to keep publication costs very low---hence the lack of adequate editorial supervision---and perhaps seeks a less literate audience than do many publishers. Of course, this audience is a vast one, and Pineiro very successful at reaching it... Pineiro's credentials are good ones, and the details of these varied fields in his work are accurate. We feel that he probably has a really good book in him for those of us interested in the impact of the Internet, but sadly, CyberTerror isn't it...For a full review see Interface, Volume 4, Issue 3."
5,Cyberterror,This author just gets better and better. His subject and characters made up a very intriguing story. It grabbed me by the hand and ran me at a break-neck speed through an adventure not even imagined. He got my attention early with the pipeline because I don't live so far from them but he never let up with adding more to the story with the the action inside the brains of a computer and much more. Action movies are exciting but books like this are so much more. I didn't even miss the visuals because he paints it so well for me to see. It just amazes how unlimited the possibilities for terror are. To me this is fantasy but in reality........... Most of us will never know just how much of a possibility some of this is. I'm looking forward to more of his books.
4,A good solid read with lots of action and suspense,"Good plot and a fast moving storyline that is sure to provide terrorists with plenty of new targets to think about. An equal mix of adrenaline and testosterone that feels like a season script for the TV show ""24"" - or maybe a Bruce Willis miniseries.The writing is solid but the author has the annoying habit of referring to the September 11 / World Trade Center attacks so many times (nearly every other page in the first 50 pages - and much more towards the end), that this reader got tired of it. It is as if he keeps doing a George W. Bush impression-repeating Sept. 11 as a Mantra, trying unsuccessfully to push emotional buttons without reason-and looking stupid because of it.Not my favorite book by Peneiro, but a good solid read with lots of action and suspense."
5,"Cheap, but work like a charm!","I picked up a couple packs of these when I bought new surround sound speakers & I'm very pleased with them. They're relatively beefy & provide a very secure connection between my receiver & my 14 ga speaker cabling. You need to use a quality crimping tool to get the terminals crimped securely to your speaker cables, and you should be somewhat careful since these are not beefy enough to disconnect/reconnect repeatedly. But they are the best banana plugs I've found for the $."
4,Hanseatic League Trading Simulation,"Complex markets, realistic trading, town development, personal advancement, etc., this game has it all. Patrician II incorporates an interesting time period where growth in trade and city development was pinnacle for Northern Europe. Running your own business in a medieval situation gives a new found respect for the hardships these entrepreneurial souls endured while carving out their markets.Patrician II has excellent graphics; it sets a feel to the game that makes it very enjoyable. The game-play is fantastic; there are tons of options to adjust to your speed or difficulty level. The multiplayer works flawlessly and the game appears to have been tested quite efficiently. No patches were necessary, and bugs and crashing are non existent. Strategy First is definitely making a name for itself for delivering stable working games, with impeccable historical accuracy and interesting environments and time periods very few game manufacturers explore."
5,A must have!!,"After several years being a video gamer finally I've found this incredibly addictive game. Patrician II definitively isn't like other action games that last just the weekend. Long term playing without boring, trade and fight for power and glory. Excellent graphics and music score; what a simulation!!I'm waiting for the next releases from ASCARON SOFTWARE: Patrician III and Port Royale, also based in the old trading ages and piracy. Hunt or be hunted..."
4,"Better then the first, enjoyible to a point","Many years ago, I ran across the first installment and said, this idea was good, but something was missing. Well, they must have heard me over in Germany. The reminds me in many ways of Pirates, (Yes, I am old enough to remember that game). Sailing the North and Baltic Seas in order to gain a high rank among the trading towns of the north. The graphics are fairly good and the detail is ok, the manual has a few words they forgot to translate from German. You can marry and ship and hunt pirates, or be one yourself. You have your choice of 8 cities to start from. The micromanagement is the only real distractor from this game. When one gets many ships, it becomes very hard to manage the ships and if you are mayor of a town, the stress level increases. But if you are like and remember the good old days of Pirates!, this game is for you. It is worth the money!!!!"
2,just talking,"i've been taking xanax's for over 20 years weather i got them off the street or from a doctor i got them. sometimes i would have to go without for a few days. well on dec. 08 2003 i had a prescription. i was taking them and i had a wreck. well to make a long story short my wife lost her right arm, i broke every bone in my face expect my skull, and my 7 month old boy broke his leg. but by the Lords grace he let us live. well i decided i was going to quit taking the xanaxs(after the wreck i was on pain pills to) i decided i was going to quit taking all medication all together. well guess what? i had 2 seizures one in feb. and one in march. i had to start taking my xanaxs again but i,ve cut way back and i hope i can gradualy quit taking them all together."
4,Time well spent,"If baseball cards are your hobby this is for you. I have bought several of thses boxes. Generally, You will pull a game used or auto card in every box. With the variety and the varying ages of the packs, This is a real winner."
2,Overrated,"After reading the great reviews of this product, I decided I'd try it out. I bought 5, and did not receive anything close to to the other reviewers. No autograph cards, and only one game used memorabilia. My bonuses were a couple bobble head dolls (one which the back was torn off), some talking cards, and one pack of collectors choice (which was almost worthless because of its condition). Who knows, maybe I was unlucky, and I'd still recommend this product because of its excellent variety, but don't get your hopes up!"
3,Contents disappointing,The delivery was efficient. The disappointment came when I opened the book. I bought this book as a gift for my son. I had no idea that the ENTIRE inside of the book was totally black and white even all the great pictures. The only color on this book is the cover. I wish I would have realized it before I bought it. The info is great just the presentation is disappointing. If I had seen it in a bookstore I would not have bought it. I hope my son likes it regardless.
2,Nice but not great,"I am looking to purchase a DeLorean and needed some general information about the car, the brand, the person etc.. This particular book is not more than a collection of black & white news clippings from various newspapers around the world. Quality of the print is acceptable (not excellent) and there are no coloured images. Although the information is interesting, you read the same stories 100 times again because many newspapers apparently wrote the same things about Delorean. Being somewhat disapppointed, I looked at Wikipedia and within minutes found the information and facts I needed, clearly written, not repetitive and without having to pay for it. This is not a bad book, I just think the description on Amazon is not clear enough. Probably a good book for someone who already owns a DeLorean and wants to complete his collection of DeLorean books."
3,The Fighter that Saved England,"This is a wonderful reprint of the RAF manual of the Spitfire. It is the actual book that the fliers used. If you are a writer of military history of the air war over Europe during World war II you need to acquire this title.Reading the pages I can hear the sound of its engines and of the men who took to the skies in them. They are leaving us at the rate of 3,000 @ week. Don't forget what they all did in the air, land and sea."
2,Broken Dishes,"These bowls are wonderful - a great addition to my Winterberry collection, however they came packaged in the same packaging as they would in store, so during shipment they were broken. Amazon was great to send replacements, but some of those were broken too. I have finally received all dishes I ordered, but beware of receiving broken dishes."
5,"It wasn't bootcamp, it was war","I lived through one of the worst Clarions on record. Kate and Damon were a soothing end to a month of hell, but in the long run, Clarion was like life - there's no rhyme or reason to who comes out ahead or who comes out alive.If you feel cheated that you didn't get your six weeks on an arid Midwestern campus, just stay home and write for six weeks. You'll get more done and it will cost a lot less."
4,"Quality stuff, but not a quick read","I have lived in east Africa, and I have enjoyed this author before, so I read this. It is not as compelling as I had hoped, but it has a strength about it that makes it a good read."
4,Africa,"It was a very educational book, and made me realize that we often forget that africa has much multiculturalism. As in indian i found it interesting to see the views of indians who have left india much earlier than those who came to north america. I learned alot. I found vassanji to ramble on detail at times. but you get used to it.it was a good book. but it was a long read, andon only character that made me not wanna put it down was Njoroge."
1,It was a counfusing book for me,"I think this book was too confusing to read, but it had a lot of good information about Benedict Arnold. The book was too confusing because the events in the book changed a lot and it was hard for me to remember the names and the time. Since I haven't learned much about the history of America I find this book boring. I'm not an American, so I only learned part of its history. The author's writing is like she is telling a story about Benedict Arnold, so she didn't really say that Benedict Arnold was a bad guy or anything like that. One good part about this book is that it tells the events in order like from when Benedict was a child to when he died. So that wasn't too confusing. I know some books that had all the events mixed up. If you like books about history and heroes in the past then I suggest you read this book. I suggest you read this book because Jean Fritz is a pretty good writer, and she wrote many good books."
2,"Fair, Not Exciting","I read this book to my boys ages 11, 9, 7 & 5. It was one of the least exciting books we have read. It covers some good information but is fairly dry. The use of profanity in a book that is supposed to be aimed at 9-12 year olds was also surprising."
3,arrsteph - My Review for Academy Extra Credit,"I read this book for a school assignment. It was a very interesting book, filled with understandable facts. In general, I think this book would have been better if Jean Fritz had shared more about Benedict Arnolds childhood/teens and how that really affected his life choices. It would have also made the book better if the author really delved into the question: Why did Arnold become a traitor?In the end, I rate this book a 3 because of the amount of research it must have taken and the historical facts that are easy to understand and remember."
1,Traitor-- the worst book in history!,"Traitor had good information, but the way it was put together was confusing.Like, there would be one important fact and then about thirty pages of deitail and then another big fact. The first big fact would have been so far back that you wouldn't remember it and then you don't understand the story. I would NOT suggest reading it. Seriously."
3,leather is really thin and almost brittle. Watch itself seems to be working well.,"It has a nice appearance and the watch itself works well, but the leather is poor quality. It seems both thin and almost brittle. Very disappointing for a Pulsar product."
5,best of the lot,"I've been compiling a database of recorded sea shanties, and listening to hundreds of songs. This is easily my favorite collection. An amazing set of songs, some rarely heard, and all beautifully performed. The best versions of many shanties are scattered about (eg Dead Horse by the Albion Band), and collections tend towards the commercial, or the croakingly 'authentic'. But there are no field recordings of these uncensored worksongs, so nothing is really authentic. This CD is a fine compromise."
4,Sailors of old music,"If you like the sailing music of the clipper ships of old, then this music brings you on board today. You feel as if you are actually sailing with the old sailors lugging heavy ropes, etc.Thanks for a great CD."
5,We absolutely adore this!!,We're weekend sailors with a small craft at the local marina. These shanties have become not only a favorite of ours (to sing along to as we sail along with the CD at full volume) but has become a favorite of the entire marina!! This is a lot of fun!
4,Authentic-sounding sea chanties,"If you want to know how sea chanties originally sounded on the decks and under them back in the 18th and 19th centuries, this is an album for you. It can be a time-consuming process to sort through the load of sea chanty albums out there that when you're trying to find the traditional sound. Therefore, if you like the sound of this album I also recommend the following albums, composed by various performers including some on this album: Blow the Man Down; Round Cape Horn; Sailors' Songs & Sea Shanties. These albums have a great mix of emotion in them, from rip-roarin' drinking songs to inspirational working songs to melancholy tunes about ships that were swallowed up by the sea."
5,Loved them All,"I originally bought this book to read Lynn Kurland's story, but after I read her story I decided to keep going and read the others. I found ALL the stories to be good reads, especially Jo Beverly's ""A Gift of Light"". This has given me the opportunity to find other authors that are readable."
5,Very cute stories,Enjoyed each story. I wish more writers would go back to writing time travel romances instead of vampires. They were all well written.
3,Some issues with some of the Spanish Words,"As a native Spanish speaker, it is very important for me that my son learn Spanish. My son loves all of the books in this series, but this one causes me a few problems. Part of the problem is the Spanish words used (which is an issue for my dialect). For example, ""bananas"" is translated as ""las bananas"" instead of ""los platanos"" and peas are translated as ""las guisantes"" instead of ""los chicharros"" and ""broccolli"" is ""el brecol"" instead of ""el broculi"" (sorry my keyboard is not set to do accents). The other issue is some of the foods selected. For example, ""soup"" is one of the foods, but it is hard to draw in a way that children really understand that is is soup. ""Radish"" is anothert choice, but since it is such an uncommon vegetable, I am not sure why she didn't use someting like a potato or a bell pepper, which are more common. So, I would recommend this book, but be prepared to change some of the words around using your computer, printer, and some glue."
4,Great as a supplement or review,"This brightly colored book is great to use as an addition to a Spanish curriculum like the workbook Flip Flop Spanish. The sturdy pages continue to wow my classes of ages 3 all the way to 12 years old. If you'd like to introduce your child to Spanish, I might choose an animal, colors, or shapes book before this one.The changes in words based on region, as another reviewer stated, are hard to get around - the problems she had with the words are less common where we live - so I think it's great to know ANY word when you're trying to introduce a second language to your child. It's a big endeavor, and this book helps!"
